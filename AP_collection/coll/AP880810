   An official Iranian report said Australia's
foreign minister came to Iran on Wednesday ready to discuss his
nation's participation in Iran's post-war reconstruction.
   Foreign Minister Bill Hayden of Australia met with Iranian
President Ali Khamenei on Wednesday and called for more trade
between the two countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   It said Hayden expressed pleasure in the scheduled cease-fire in
the eight-year-old war between Iran and Iran. A U.N.-mediated truce
has been set for Aug. 20.

<TEXT>
   Security forces Wednesday night
shot and killed one of three gunmen converging on an army
checkpoint close to the border with the Irish Republic, police
said. The two other men escaped.
   The Irish National Liberation Army, a Marxist offshoot of the
mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army, said in a statement to
news organizations that the dead man was one of its guerrillas and
was on ``active service'' at the time.
   Active service is a guerrilla euphemism for a shooting or
bombing mission.
   Belfast police headquarters said the three men converged on the
checkpoint at the village of Clady near Strabane, 65 miles west of
Belfast.
   But it made no mention of the gunmen firing and gave few
details, except to report that security forces later found a loaded
gun and a guerrilla-style ski mask at the scene.
   It said the slain man was in his twenties and was from the
Strabane area.
   Protestant guerrillas earlier Wednesday claimed responsibility
for the submachine-gun killings of two Catholics in Belfast Monday.
   An anonymous telephone caller told the Belfast Telegraph
newspaper that gunmen of the Protestant Action Force shot Peter
Dolan, 25, and Seamus Morris, 18, to avenge the shooting deaths of
two Protestant workers by the IRA five days earlier.
   The shadowy Protestant Action Force is reportedly linked with
the better known Protestant paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force.
   Hundreds of mourners attended Wednesday's funeral for Dolan, a
beer deliveryman. Catholic Bishop Cahal Daly appealed for factions
on both sides of the sectarian divide to lay down their arms.
   ``For the love of Ireland, for the sake particularly of the
Catholic community, for the good of the nationalists you claim to
represent, bring an end to this slaughter,'' Daly told mourners.
   As in other years, hundreds of Catholic youths rioted Monday and
Tuesday to mark the 17th anniversary of Britain's now-abandoned
policy of detaining guerrillas without trial. Police said street
violence wound down by Wednesday.
   In an acceleration of IRA attacks, guerrillas last week killed
six people. One was a soldier killed in a bombing at a barracks in
north London. The other five _ a policeman, two part-time soldiers
of the Ulster Defense Regiment and two Protestant civilians working
on a police station _ died in separate attacks in Northern Ireland.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule. Protestants form a majority in Northern Ireland.
   The death of the guerrilla slain Wednesday night brings the
overall toll since sectarian and political violence flared in
Northern Ireland in August 1969 to at least 2,673.

   Arnulfo Arias Madrid, who long dominated civilian
politics in Panama even though deposed from the presidency three
times by the military, died Wednesday of a heart attack. He was 87.
   Arias, who lived in exile in Miami, was educated in the United
States and became active in his new nation's politics as early as
1931, when he helped engineer a coup against the president. He
later was ambassador to France and England, and in Europe became
enamored of Mussolini's fascism.
   Arias returned to advocate it in Panama, and was elected
president in 1940-41, 1949-51 and for 11 days in 1968. Each time,
he was ousted by the Military. In 1986 Arias accused the military
of killing opposition leader Dr. Hugo Spadafora, who had accused
Noriega's government of involvement with drugs. This year in Miami,
Noriega was indicted for alleged drug trafficking.

<TEXT>
   A witness testifying Wednesday at the trial
of men charged in the torture-murder of drug enforcement agent
Enrique Camarena testified that he saw one of the defendants at the
scene of the killing.
   George Gomez Espana Gonzalez, who cut a plea bargain with the
government, testified that he picked up Rene Verdugo Urquidez at
the villa of a Mexican drug kingpin in Guadalajara, Mexico, during
the time Camarena was held there.
   Gonzalez, a real estate salesman, said he drove his boss to the
home of Rafael Caro Quintero on either Feb. 7 or Feb. 8, 1985.
   Camarena was abducted Feb. 7, 1985, from outside the U.S.
consulate in Guadalajara. The government says he ws taken to Caro's
house where he was tortured and killed during a 24-hour period.
   Gonzalez said he waited in the kitchen of the villa where he saw
several semi-automatic weapons and heard Caro talking with a group
of men in the back yard.
   When he departed , he said, Verdugo hitched a ride, bringing
with him a man he referred to as ``Commandante.''
   He said Verdugo appeared tired. He added that he needed some
sleep and spoke of having solved a problem with the help of the
commandante.
   In a tape recording of Camarena's torture and inquisition, one
of his interrogators is referred to as ``Commandante.''
   Gonzalez said he met Verdugo once before in 1984 in connection
with a financial transaction in which a suitcase full of about $1
million in cash from Caro, was transported to San Diego for deposit
in a bank.
   Verdugo's role in the money laundering transaction was unclear
other than that he was present.
   Gonzalez' testimony was interrupted frequently by defense
objections that it constituted hearsay. His comment that the $1
million came from Caro ultimately was stricken from the court
record.
   Gonzalez told jurors he struck a plea bargain with the
government to testify in the trial to avoid going to prison for
making false statements about the importation of money, the $1
million, and offering a bribe to a federal officer.
   Verdugo, 36, and Raul Lopez Alvarez,28, are charged with the
torture murder of Camarena, whose body was found buried at a remote
Mexican ranch along with that of his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
Both had been severely beaten and Camarena's skull was crushed.
   The government alleges that Caro,33, head of a powerful drug
cartel, orchestrated the killings. He was charged in Mexico and is
being tried there along with other defendants.
   A third defendant in the Los Angeles federal court trial, Jesus
Felix Gutierrez, 38, is charged with helping Caro flee Mexico after
Camarena's killing.

   You can't put a price on love and marriage, a judge

   Matchmaker Bobbie Heiman sued her customers, Denise Canchola and
Philip de Tournillion III, for the additional money following their
1984 marriage. She received $295 from each for arranging their
initial meeting in 1983.
   ``I was so disgusted at having to sue someone for getting
married and not paying the bonus,'' Ms. Heiman said. ``I got real
burned out matching people up and then not getting any strokes for
doing a good job.''
   But the couple, a nurse and a businessman, said they refused to
pay the fee out of principle and because mutual love, not Ms.
Heiman's magic, led them down the aisle.
   Dade County Judge Eli Breger on Monday agreed, declaring the
additional fee invalid.

   The Sierra Club said Tuesday that it had
supplied an incorrect air-quality reading for Providence, R.I., in
its report Monday on smog problems across the nation.
   Dan Weiss, Washington representative for the Sierra Club, said
the 1988 peak ozone reading for Providence should have been .20
parts per million, not the .24 ppm contained in the list.
   At a level of .24 ppm, Providence would have had the worst
air-quality reading among the 47 cities and counties covered in the
list. Several cities and counties had readings that equaled or
exceeded .20 ppm.
   The federal health standard for ozone pollution is .12 ppm.
Ozone, which causes respiratory problems, is formed when nitrogen
oxides and hydrocarbons combine in the presence of sunlight.

   The battle of the bare bodies has heated up in Italy
this summer, with several towns and resort islands ruling that men
and women must wear shirts in public or face penalties.
   A Belgian man was even reported beaten up after he refused a
request by a Rome subway attendant to cover his naked chest.
   One southern town has made a notable break with the trend,
guaranteeing that people can walk around topless. Agropoli's
tourism chief has called on women to bare all, but the local priest
is fighting back.
   Topless bathing, popular in Italy for some time, now appears to
be on the decline. One-piece suits, unthinkable a few years ago,
have now become fashionable.
   ``It's necessary to return to the good taste of the past,''
Capri tourism commissioner Giuseppe Massa told the Italian news
agency ANSA.
   The famous island put into effect a new ``cover-up'' ordinance
Tuesday that bars anyone from walking the streets with a bare chest
or just a swimsuit. Penalties for offenders range from $70 to $350.
   According to Mayor Saverio Valente, the law was necessary ``for
reasons not only aesthetic, but hygienic.''
   On the island of Ponza, about 65 miles to the north in the
Tyrrhenian Sea, bathers are also barred from strolling the streets
in swimsuits.
   Mayor Francesco Ferraiuolo acted this month after receiving a
note from local Roman Catholic priest worried about the practice,
according to Italian press reports.
   In Venice, meanwhile, a former director of tourism, Augusto
Salvadori, is organizing patrols to advise tourists on how to dress
and eat properly in the canal city. Travelers in shorts or
too-skimpy sundresses are barred from the main section of St.
Mark's Basilica.
   Frustration with toplessness boiled over on a subway in the
Italian capital Monday, according to Rome's Il Messaggero newspaper.
   A subway worker advised 23-year-old Daniel Serge Meuree of
Belgium to put on a shirt, the paper said, and the youth replied
with a shrug of his shoulders.
   ``He even began to spit on the pavement muttering, it appeared,
not very pleasant epithets about the Italians. And therefore
someone, filled with the love of his country, reacted,'' the paper
said.
   Several subway passengers slapped and punched the Belgian, who
subsequently pulled on a blue shirt, the paper said.
   A clash of a different sort has broken out in Agropoli, where
the tourism commissioner, seeking a new image for the town, has
called on women to go topless whenever possible.
   The parish priest claims the law will transform the town into a
modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah.
   ``To admire the beauty of a body helps to elevate the spirit,''
said tourism commissioner Vincenzo Pepe.
   ``Tourism is going through a worrisome slow phase,'' he added.
``What can we do, allow Agropoli to become a colony for old
people?''
   Pepe gave his support for a topless fashion show scheduled last
Sunday in the village 60 miles south of Naples.
   But the Rev. Armando Borrelli vowed that ``if the girls take
their clothes off, I will toll the funeral bells.''
   About 5,000 people turned out for the show, but the women
decided to wear clothes. Pepe has promised a topless show this
Sunday, and Borrelli has said he will counter with a solemn Mass.
   ``We have defeated Sodom and Gomorrah,'' and bare chests in
Agropoli will be defeated too, he told the Rome newspaper La
Repubblica.

   Roll down the car window anywhere near
the plant where Louisiana's most famous hot sauce still is made
from a century-old recipe, and your head just fills up with the
scent _ a little tomatoey, a little spicy, a lot hot.
   The odor is so much a part of the place that Paul C.P.
McIlhenny, whose family has been making Tabasco sauce from the
start, doesn't even notice it unless he's up close to the pulp
barrels.
   Hot sauce in southern Louisiana is like that smell. It's
everywhere. On every table in every restaurant. Two dozen or so
varieties. Louisiana hot sauce is a tourist attraction: It's on
posters and coffee mugs and key chains, and people take tours of
hot sauce factories.
   ``In the river parishes, where the Acadians first landed, its
hard not to find a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce on the table,''
said John Folse, a chef and restaurateur in Donaldsonville who
introduced Cajun food to Moscow during the summit meeting earlier
this year. ``It's almost like salt, pepper and Louisiana hot.''
   There is, of course, the theory that people who live in such
steamy heat eat hot foods to perspire and cool off.
   ``My mother's people and my father's people grew hot peppers
because they thought they were good for you,'' said television's
down-home Cajun chef, Justin Wilson.
   But there's much more than science at work in a land where what
to eat for dinner is often the focus of luncheon conversation and
what to eat tomorrow is the dinner-table talk. Good food really
matters here.
   ``When someone asks, `What are you doing this afternoon?, You
say, `Oh I don't know, maybe a crawfish boil.' They always think in
terms of cooking,'' said Folse.
   And most everything _ even to a bloody Mary sorbet, says Folse _
gets a dash or two of hot sauce.
   ``I don't think anything's worth a darn unless it's seasoned
well,'' said Wilson, who is partial to cayenne peppers.
   McIlhenny, 44, vice president of the McIlhenny Co., figures he
goes through a 2-ounce bottle a month of Tabasco, which, by the
way, is not a generic name, though McIlhenny's pleased if you think
so.
   Hot sauce is addictive, he said. ``I've had friends use it out
of loyalty, and then say, `Hey, this is good,' as if it was a
surprise. They say they get addicted.''
   So it's no surprise there are so many kinds _ Tabasco,
Trappey's, Tony Cachere's Creole Hot Sauce, Crystal Hot Sauce,
Cajun Chef, Louisiana Gold, Durkee Sauce, Panola Red, Cajun Power
Hot Sauce. You get the idea.
   A premium sauce, it's agreed, uses only the pepper pulp. No
seeds or skin. Most contain just salt, vinegar and peppers,
although some labels say it fancier. Crystal, for example, lists
``fresh ripe aged peppers,'' and Cajun Chef contains ``select
Louisiana cayenne peppers.''
   So, can connoisseurs distinguish among them?
   Sure, said Folse, noting that most chefs stock four of five
varieties.
   ``I've got items in my kitchen I use Tabasco on. However, I also
really like Louisiana Gold,'' he said. ``I don't find that it's
quite as hot as Tabasco ... and when you have five or six chefs on
the line, you want to have a little control. If they put one shot
or two shots, you don't want to change the flavor competely.''
   ``They all have a little different flavor, and they all use a
little different amounts of vinegar, salt,'' said Wilson. ``There
are certain ones I prefer. ... It's just a question of experience,
and God knows I have a lot of that.''
   The McIlhenny Co., too, has plenty of experience. Tabasco is
sold in 100 countries; it's been on space missions.
   ``We end up in strange places,'' said McIlhenny. ``I understand
two or three Sherpas in Nepal will use a bottle at a single meal.''
   Nepal is a long way from tiny Avery Island, 18 square miles that
are home to 700 people, the Tabasco plant and fields, a salt mine
and oil wells. There also are 100,000 snowy egrets, 30,000 azaleas
and 17,000 irises.
   Avery Island is not really an island, but a salt dome that rises
from the marshes and bayous on Louisiana's Gulf Coast. At 152 feet
above sea level, the island is the highest point along the gulf
from Mexico to Florida. It sits 150 miles from New Orleans,
separated by sugar cane, rice and oil fields.
   In 1818, John Craig Marsh obtained rights to part of the island,
and later a Louisiana judge, Daniel Dudley Avery, bought part. In
1837 Avery married Marsh's daughter and eventually obtained the
entire island.
   In 1859, Edmund McIlhenny married an Avery daughter. The story
is told, though not verified, that the family fled Avery Island in
the Civil War and returned to find everything destroyed _ except
one defiant pepper plant grown from a seed or seedling given to
Edmund by a friend returning from Mexico.
   What is known is that Edmund McIlhenny came up with a sauce to
perk up the bland food available during Reconstruction.In 1868, he
packed his invention in ladies' perfume bottles, and sent samples
off to 350 wholesalers. Two years later he had a patent, and in two
years more a London office to handle all the European orders.
   His sauce used a variety of Capsicum frutescens, a small
fire-engine-red pepper, of which the McIlhenny Co. today is the
world's largest producer. Tabasco is an Indian word for damp earth,
which McIlhenny apparently chose because he liked the sound of it.
   One hundred twenty years later, little has changed. McIlhenny is
still a family company, with Paul McIlhenny and two cousins in
charge. And Avery Island is their kingdom.
   ``This is an ideal site,'' said McIlhenny. ``Part of the
mystique is that only the soil, only the climate, only the nimble
fingers of Avery Island could pick Tabasco.''
   The peppers are harvested in summer, by hand, and must be
processed the same day.
   But today, only 10 percent of the peppers needed are grown on
the island. To protect against disease, pests, hurricanes and labor
troubles, seeds for the rest of the peppers are sent to Central and
South America. The mash is returned to Avery Island.
   Paul McIlhenny inspects every white oak barrel of mash for
aroma, color, particle size. He rejects one barrel in 100.
   The pulp is mashed with salt _ eight pounds to 100 pounds of
peppers _ and aged three years. The mash is then mixed with a
strong white vinegar and stirred mechanically for 28 days. Finally,
it is strained and bottled.
   And even then it's not just a bottle of sauce.
   ``Hot sauces in Louisiana are almost a religion,'' said Folse.
``You go to church on Sunday, hot sauce on Monday through Friday.''

   While they weren't exactly hollering,
``Lights, camera, action,'' aides to George Bush were doing some
directing at the Republican platform sessions.
   Leaving nothing to chance in making sure no stray language crept
into the platform, the aides were seen standing at the back of
subcommittee hearings Tuesday giving nods and signals to panel
members on how to deal with votes.
   In the subcommittee on family and community, the staff activity
was particularly noticeable during the discussion of language on
AIDS. The plank says AIDS victims should be encouraged to seek
early diagnosis and remain at their jobs or in school as long as
they are physically able.
   One Bush staffer gave thumbs up and down signals, as well
nodding his head up and down and maintaining eye contact with
panelists.
   The orchestration by the Bush staff was ``not at all
Machiavellian,'' said Deborah Steelman, campaign director of
domestic policy.
   Noting confusion voiced by subcommittee members over platform
tax language, she said, ``The proposals are not very well
understood by the committee. Many of them are much more informed
than others. ...
   ``We just have to make sure that everybody understands what
Bush's position is and where we stand in terms of what they have on
the table,'' Steelman said.
   She noted that the vice president had addressed the platform
delegates Monday, seeking to make sure that the platform is very
specific. ``That's what we're involved in here today, to make sure
that that happens,'' she said.
   During one break in the family subcommittee meeting, panelists
huddled with the Bush staff before coming back to withdraw a motion
that called for weakening of agency shop rules on mandatory payment
of union dues.
   Steelman said new AIDS language submitted by subcommittee
co-chairman Rick Montoya _ and approved unanimously by the panel _
was instigated by the campaign and is consistent with Bush's
position.
   In presenting it, Montoya said it showed sensitivity to the
needs of AIDS victims as well as concern mentioned in earlier
language about the spread of the deadly disease.
   The gay community for years has criticized President Reagan as
being insensitive to the AIDS crisis. The party's 1984 platform
contained no mention of the disease.
   As a member of the Reagan administration, Bush engenders the
same suspicion from gays.
   In the foreign policy subcommittee hearing, former Sen. John
Tower of Texas, a top Bush supporter, made no bones about
representing the campaign when he stood up to urge the committee to
leave language on Israel intact.
   He told the committee he was speaking as a representative of the
Bush campaign.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Glasnost'' has come _ or
returned _ to Czechoslovakian art with the first freewheeling
exhibit by hundreds of artists held in Prague since 1969.
   Twenty-five thousand people filed past more than 2,700 works by
882 artists in the first two weeks of the ``Prague salon'' staged
at a city stadium and in the Park of Culture and Recreation.
   Following demands for such a show at a meeting last year of the
state-run Union of Artists, the salon is free of the rigid
restrictions imposed on most art exhibits since the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms of 1968 were crushed.
   Picking up on a tradition started with a salon in 1968 but
abandoned after 1969, works are shown in alphabetical order. Each
artist gets the same space, regardless of rank, and is free to fill
it with any work completed in the last five years.
   The result is a chaotic mix of abstract, expressionist and
surrealist styles competing side-by-side for the visitors'
attention.
   Despite the freedom, however, there is no explosion of
previously unknown talent.
   Nonetheless, some artists make bold steps into the political
sphere. Premysl Vanicek, for example, hung a kitsch portrait of
Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev close to a portrait in identical style
of Franz Kafka, the author whose full works are still unpublished
in his native Prague.
   Another picture, by Vaclav Sramek, consists entirely of the
letters P and A and is entitled ``Perestroika, A Variation on
Somebody Else's Theme'' _ a possible allusion to the similarity
between Gorbachev's reforms and those introduced in Czechoslovakia
in 1968 by Alexander Dubcek.
   Elsewhere in the exhibit, Olga Berekova displays a portrait of
Pope John Paul II, while rock star Mick Jagger graces the sculpture
section.
   The exhibit is limited to members and candidates of the Artists'
Union. In the past, the union was often accused of giving
preferential treatment to some members and failing to promote young
artists who have a chance to show at the salon.
   One idea behind the present exhibit seems to have been an
official desire to show that the alleged restrictions were not
preventing great young talents from coming forward.
   ``Gone is the era when so-called forbidden fruit tasted good
just because it had the odor of something forbidden, unwelcome and
outlawed,'' the political and arts weekly Tvorba said.
   ``The possibility of such a broad exhibition ... prevents the
birth of wronged artists and even martyrs because of an insensitive
and entirely unnecessary administrative intervention. All were
given the same chance and only the future will show who will win.''
   Official support for the salon went all the way up to Communist
Party leader Milos Jakes, who praised it as a chance for artists to
compare works.
   But not everybody was so enthusiastic. Czechoslovakia's graphic
artists, highly ranked internationally, did not take part, and not
one professor from the Academy of Arts chose to display works.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo chafed at the low standard
of many works shown and took issue with at least one sculpture,
criticizing a torn chaise longue with a figure made out of tree
fungi as a work that had nothing to do with contemporary art.
   The exhibit was preceded by a handful of much smaller shows that
were tolerated but not officially sponsored in Prague last year.
   The Soviet drive for glasnost, or openness, in the arts and
state-run media has produced nothing like the outstandingly frank
films, plays and articles now seen in Moscow. But a few previously
banned films have been shown and the media has printed articles on
previously taboo topics such as drug addiction and prostitution.

<HEAD>Drought Expected To Have Little Effect on This Year's Commodity
Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the drought is reducing crop
production sharply, Agriculture Department analysts do not expect
it to have much effect on U.S. commodity exports this year.
   On May 26, before the drought's impact was apparent, the USDA
forecast agricultural exports at a value of $33.5 billion in the
fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, up from $27.9 billion in
1986-97. The volume of shipments was forecast at 145.5 million
metric tons, up from 129.2 million.
   ``Exports in 1988 are primarily crops harvested during the
1987-88 crop year,'' says the department's Economic Research
Service. ``The drought will affect next year's exports more than
this year's.''
   The agency report, which was by economist Stephen A. MacDonald,
was in the August issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. It did
not include projections for 1988-89 exports, however. Those are
scheduled to be released by USDA on Aug. 25.
   ``The drought's impact on exports during fiscal 1989 will depend
both on how much U.S. production drops and on how overseas
competitors and consumers react to higher prices,'' the report
said. ``Previous droughts in 1980 and 1983 provide useful
indicators.''
   For example, in the 1980-81 crop year, U.S. corn and soybean
supplies declined 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively, from the
previous year. At the same time, export prices averaged 18 percent
higher for corn and 16 percent higher for soybeans.
   And in 1983-84, corn and soybeans supplies dropped 29 percent
and 19 percent, while export prices rose an average of 23 percent
and 24 percent.
   Meanwhile, the actual volume of corn exports fell by less than 4
percent following the 1980 and 1983 droughts, while soybean exports
dropped 17 percent following the 1980 drought and 19 percent after
1983.
   ``But with higher prices, the value of agricultural exports rose
after each drought year,'' the report said.
   In 1980-81, the value of U.S. farm exports rose to a record of
$43.8 billion before declining. The export value, after sliding to
$34.8 billion in 1982-83, jumped to $38 billion in 1983-84,
reflecting the higher prices and shorter supplies.
   ``Although drought-reduced supplies and higher prices will help
cut the U.S. share of world agricultural trade in 1988-89, there is
no reason to believe that the drought will permanently constrain
the U.S. share of the world market,'' the report said.
   Exports dropped sharply in the early 1980s and still have not
recovered their former glory. But the report said ``conditions were
substantially different'' then.
   For one thing, the early 1980s were marked by global recession
and severe contraction in the ability of developing countries to
pay for imports. The global economy was recovering by 1984, but the
dollar and U.S. price supports had risen for several years,
prompting foreign producers to increase output and take advantage
of higher prices.
   Today, world economic growth is expected to remain near 3
percent in 1989, and U.S. price supports _ which tend to dominate
international commodity prices _ are lower as a result of the 1985
farm law. Also, the report said, the dollar has been declining for
three years and is unlikely to rebound.
   ``These conditions suggest a better post-drought outlook for
U.S. agricultural exports after fiscal 1989 than existed after
fiscal 1981 and 1984,'' the report said.
   Further, the continued strength of ``high-value'' exports such
as meat and horticultural products, is a major factor in the
overall outlook. Those items declined less than grain, oilseed and
cotton during the mid-1980s and recovered sooner, beginning in 1986.
   This year, the report said, horticultural products are expected
to rise $550 million to a record $3.7 billion, while exports of
animal products are projected to rise $600 million to a record $5.6
billion. Overall, exports of high-value products are expected to
reach $15.3 billion in 1987-88, matching the 1980-81 record.
   High-value exports go mainly to developed countries, where
financial constraints are ``almost unheard of'' and where local
currencies have risen against the U.S. dollar in recent years, the
report said. In all, sales to those countries are expected to climb
$1.7 billion this year to $16.7 billion, the biggest surge in four
years.
   Agricultural exports to the European Economic Community rose
$594 million during the first eight months of 1987-88 and are
expected to total $7.2 billion for the entire year, a 6 percent
increase.
   The report said the rise in EEC purchases stems from ``moderate
income and employment growth'' in the 12-nation bloc, and the
``inexpensive'' dollar, which allows Europeans to get more for
their currencies.

<HEAD>Cabinet Nominee Cavazos Stresses Education Opportunities For
Hispanics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lauro Cavazos' father always stressed the
importance of education to his three sons growing up in the untamed
brushland of the huge King Ranch.
   The strength of that message took Cavazos all the way to the
White House, where President Reagan Tuesday nominated him to
succeed William J. Bennett as secretary of education.
   Cavazos, 61, is the president of Texas Tech University and its
medical school, and the first Hispanic to hold that post. The
24,000-student school is the largest in the country run by a
Hispanic.
   ``I am convinced education is the key to many things. If you
have sufficient education, you can solve most any problem in the
world. Famine. Ecological problems. Nuclear problems. Racism.
They're all solved with education,'' he said.
   At Texas Tech, Cavazos paid special attention to minority
education, overseeing the creation of a special office to handle
minority student problems and increasing efforts to recruit and
retain minorities. He spoke out regularly on the importance of
curtailing the dropout rate of minority students.
   During his tenure, Hispanic enrollment increased from 3.6
percent in 1980 to 6.3 percent in 1987, while black enrollment
edged up from 1.85 percent to 2.4 percent.
   Cavazos received the National Hispanic Leadership award of the
League of United Latin American Citizens in July for his efforts to
reduce the dropout rate among Hispanic youth.
   Despite his soft-spoken, friendly demeanor and good
organizational skills, Cavazos was sometimes criticized for being
stretched too thin in running both the university and its medical
school.
   Dr. Bernhard Mittemeyer, executive vice president of Tech's
Health Sciences Center, said Cavazos was easy to work with but
occasionally difficult to track down.
   ``He basically is a delegator,'' Mittemeyer said. ``He works
best in an atmosphere where people are able to solve problems
through communication.''
   Cavazos also aroused opposition from the faculty by proposing
five-year performance reviews of all tenured professors. The
faculty passed a vote of no confidence in his presidency in 1984,
but Cavazos eventually succeeded in getting the tenure plan adopted.
   Known informally as Larry, Cavazos is one of a trio of
remarkable brothers who left the King Ranch, where their father was
a cattle foreman, to attend what was then Texas Technological
College.
   His brother Bobby was an All-American running back who now has
his own ranch, while Dick became a four-star Army general.
   Cavazos earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's
degree in cytology at Tech before getting a doctorate in physiology
from Iowa State University in 1954. He is not a medical doctor.
   He first taught as an instructor of anatomy, and later as an
associate professor, at the Medical College of Virginia in
Richmond. Later, he was dean of the school of medicine at Tufts
University in Medford, Mass., before becoming the first alumnus to
be named president at Texas Tech in 1980.
   Cavazos has continued the family tradition at the university. He
and his wife, Peggy Ann, have 10 children, seven of whom hold Tech
degrees.
   Cavazos announced in May that he would resign as president in
July 1989 and, after a leave, return to teach anatomy in the
medical school, where he has tenure.
   ``One needs to leave the presidency when you think perhaps
you've given direction to the institution and strong leadership,''
Cavazos said at the time. ``I really believe things are in good
shape here.''
   Cavazos will take a cut in pay from his current salary of
$143,800 plus allowances and benefits. Cabinet members are paid
$99,500 annually plus $10,000 for expenses, which are tax
deductible.
   Mittemeyer said that Cavazos' experience in both academia and
administration will serve him well in his new post.
   ``I think that Dr. Cavazos, while he is mild mannered, also has
convictions about the needs of education and will speak up when he
needs to speak up,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Committee OKs Drug, Alcohol Tests on Railroad Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation that would subject most of the
nation's 300,000 railroad workers to mandatory, random drug and
alcohol testing is moving through the House after many months of
delay.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee sent the bill to the
full House on Tuesday by a voice vote. The House should ave a
chance to vote on the measure shortly after lawmakers return to
Washington in September after a recess that begins this week.
   The bill's future is in doubt, however, because the Senate
favors a more extensive measure that also would cover airline and
trucking industry employees.
   ``The public safety demands action in this Congress on random
testing of not only railroad employees, but of ... employees in the
motor carrier and aviation industries as well,'' said Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., the leading sponsor of the Senate's drug and
alcohol testing legislation.
   Congress started working on drug testing legislation in January
1987, shortly after 16 people died and 175 were injured when an
Amtrak passenger train collided with a Conrail locomotive in Chase,
Md. Two Conrail crewmen later admitted to having smoked marijuana
shortly before the accident.
   Railroad unions had opposed the legislation, arguing that it was
an invasion of privacy and could result in workers losing their
jobs because of inaccurate test results. They dropped their
opposition this spring, after the Department of Transportation
proposed testing regulations the unions considered less fair.
   The legislation would apply to most of the nation's 300,000
railroad workers, including management, but it would not cover
clerical workers.
   It would require that the workers undergo not only random
testing _ considered a deterrence _ but also examinations after
accidents, before hiring, for reasonable cause and as a part of
annual physical examinations.
   Workers found to be using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol would
be suspended without pay and required to undergo a rehabilitation
program. They would be given their old jobs back if they
successfully complete the program.
   Among the amendments the committee approved was one allowing
workers to continue being paid if they volunteer to take the
rehabilitation programs.
   The bill contains provisions designed to protect workers against
harassment, and to certify the laboratories that would conduct the
testing.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the energy and commerce
panel, complained that laboratories often conduct ``enormously
slovenly work,'' and said he would introduce legislation that would
set standards for lab work.
   ``Those people with false positives are going to lose jobs,
opportunity, they're going to lose their good name,'' Dingell said.

<HEAD>Studies: Urban Parents Are Pushing Their Children Too Hard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban Chinese parents are pushing their children
to learn too much too fast in their attempt to get the kids on the
fast track, according to studies reported in a newspaper.
   The Guangming Daily said Tuesday that if such a tendency
continues, China will soon be confronted with ``a family education
crisis.''
   It said parents have stopped teaching their children values,
like morality and the joys of labor, because they are spending too
much time cramming their childrens' heads with facts.
   A study of 2,294 elementary students in Beijing indicatea the
children help out in the house for an average of just 12 minutes a
day. The paper said American children help out for about 72 minutes
every day.
   Another study in Zhejiang province in central China found that
more than 80 percent of families in one county do not make their
elementary school age children to do any housework as long as their
grades are good.
   One teacher reported that in his class of 32 children, 20 can't
dress themselves and more than 10 have their feet and hair washed
by their mothers.
   The paper said a third study, of children in Shanghai ages 4 to
6, found that 27 percent have psychiatric abnormalities linked to a
poor family environment.
   The Guangming Daily is a leading paper for intellectuals in
China. Its report made reference only to children from urban areas,
where competition for access to the few good high schools and
universities is most intense.
   In the countryside, where 75 percent of China's 1.07 billion
people live, the opposite situation occurs. Peasants are often
loathe to send their children to school because the youngsters can
be put to work making money for the family.
   The paper said parents should not turn their homes into a
classroom for their children.
   ``I parents see their childrens aren't learning quickly enough
and then get mad at them, the children will lose all interest in
studying even before they enter school,'' the paper said.
   In recent years, the paper said, the Chinese press has been
filled with reports about child prodigies.
   ``Here a 3-year-old can memorize 100 Tang dynasty poems, there a
5-year-old can handle integral equations,'' it said. ``But in their
goal to create an early genius, many families don't take into
account whether the child is interested or whether he has a
superior intellect.''
   The paper cited the case of a 7-year-old boy in Liaoning
province who cut off his fingers because he didn't want to practice
piano.
   ``These families don't realize it but they've taken the golden
years of childhood and turned them into bitter years for their
children,'' the paper said.

<HEAD>Insider Trading Bill Gets House Committee Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House soon should get a chance to vote on
a bill that would crack down on insider trading, but the rapidly
dwindling congressional calendar is clouding the legislation's
future.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved the measure on
a voice vote Tuesday. The House is expected to vote on the proposal
shortly after lawmakers return in September from their next recess.
   Similar legislation has yet to progress very far in the Senate.
With congressional leaders hoping for adjournment in early October,
dramatic movement would have to occur for the measure to have any
chance of becoming law this year.
   Sponsor Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., called the legislation a
``tough, common sense bill,'' and said it was justified because of
the ``stunning stories of greed'' that continue to emanate from
Wall Street in the form of insider trading cases.
   Under the legislation, securities firms would be required to
construct mechanisms for detecting insider trading by their
employees. Companies could face fines if they do inadequate jobs of
preventing the release of confidential financial information by
their workers.
   The bill would boost the maximum penalty for criminal insider
trading from $500,000 to $2.5 million per violation for companies,
and from $100,000 to $1 million for individuals.
   People who provide the government with information about illegal
insider trading could receive bounties which would be a portion of
the profits that were earned illicitly.
   The maximum jail term for insider trading convictions would be
lengthened from five years to 10 years.
   Another section would authorize the Securities and Exchange
Commission to cooperate with foreign countries that are
investigating insider trading cases, in hopes that this would
encourage the other nations to help U.S. authorities pursuing
similar cases abroad.
   Securities companies have unsuccessfully sought inclusion in the
bill of a definition of insider trading so firms would know when
the law was being broken. Currently, the courts and government
agencies make their own interpretations of when insider trading
occurs.
   Opponents of putting such a definition in the law have argued
that including that language would enable violators to skirt the
prohibition.
   The measure has drawn support from Republicans as well as
Democrats. Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., said the bill shows that
``insider trading will not be tolerated in our securities markets.''

<HEAD>EPA Announces Stricter Rules for Waste Dumped in Landfills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wide variety of hazardous industrial wastes
will have to be rendered harmless before being dumped in landfills
under new rules announced by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The congressionally mandated land-disposal regulations are
expected to cost industry up to $950 million a year, according to
J. Winston Porter, assistant EPA administrator for solid waste and
emergency response.
   ``Today's action will require that nearly a third of all
hazardous wastes be de-toxified or restricted in some way when
disposed of on land,'' Porter said Tuesday in a prepared statement.
   The requirement to neutralize hazardous wastes before putting
them in landfills will affect an estimated 861 million gallons of
waste each year, according to the EPA statement.
   It said the new rules would cover, among other things, some 129
million gallons of waste from electroplating and about 83 million
gallons of furnace dust produced by mills that recycle scrap metals.
   The rules are effective immediately, except for the petroleum
industry, which produces about 172 million gallons of refinery
waste annually. That industry was given two years to comply with
the regulations.
   Steve Weil, chief of EPA's land disposal restrictions branch,
said the extra time is necessary to allow the industry to develop
facilities to incinerate the wastes or extract harmful materials
for reuse.
   As part of Tuesday's action, EPA rescinded a two-year variance
it granted last year for waste containing halogenated organic
compounds (HOCs), which are made up of substances like chlorine,
bromine and fluorine.
   The agency said it believes the nation now has sufficient
incineration capacity to neutralize HOCs.

<HEAD>Fed Raises Discount Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board, by raising a key
bank lending rate, is reassuring nervous financial markets that it
has the political will to fight inflation in an election year,
economists say.
   Investors, particularly foreign investors such as the Japanese
who are avid buyers of federal debt issued by the Treasury, have
been wondering whether Fed members, all appointees of President
Reagan, are willing to mete out the potentially painful medicine
needed to cool an overheating economy.
   ``Now they should know,'' said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed
member who is now chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America.
   On Tuesday, the board voted 6-0 to hike the discount rate, the
fee it charges for short-term loans to member banks, from 6.0
percent to 6.5 percent. Analysts said a variety of other interest
rates, including those on home mortgages, auto loans and credit
cards, are likely to climb in response.
   Changing the discount rate is the most dramatic move in the
Federal Reserve's arsenal for controlling the nation's money supply.
   Since early March, the board has made a series of less overt
tightening moves, pushing up the federal funds rate _ the interest
banks charge each other for overnight loans _ by more than a
percentage point to 7.75 percent.
   Many analysts, noting that GOP chances of keeping control of the
White House are better if people are feeling prosperous, had
expected the Fed to continue nudging up the federal funds rate as
necessary while avoiding the abrupt action of raising the discount
rate until after the elections.
   Ironically, economists' expectations may have played a role in
prompting the Fed to suprise them by acting sooner, Gramley said.
   ``Those sorts of comments ... certainly have not gone unnoticed
at the Federal Reserve,'' he said. ``It's not a situation they can
afford to take lightly. They need to convince markets that they're
operating with the long-term health of the economy in mind. They
are sending that signal with what they did.''
   The board, in a statement, said its decision ``reflects the
intent of the Federal Reserve to reduce inflationary pressures.''
   Although inflation of consumer prices for the first six months
of the year was, at 4.4 percent, the same as last year, there are
signs of trouble ahead.
   Unemployment, at 5.4 percent last month, is near its 14-year
low. Also, factories straining to meet both domestic and foreign
demand are operating at their highest capacity levels in eight
years.
   The worry is that the scarcity of labor will push up wage rates.
It is also that the growth in jobs, by putting money in people's
pockets, will keep consumer demand high at the same time that
factories are trying to produce more goods for export to meet
overseas demand fueled by the devalued dollar.
   The Fed's move is aimed at curbing this ``demand-pull''
inflation, the kind of price and wage increases that occur when
there aren't enough goods to go around or enough workers to perform
needed services.
   But the cure has its cost: consumers will have to pay more to
finance home, auto and other purchases. And, as they slow their
buying, fewer new jobs will be created.
   People with loan payments pegged to interest rate fluctuations,
such as adjustable rate mortgages and home equity loans, will be
among the first to feel the effects. As their loan payments rise,
they'll have less money to pay for other goods and services.
   ``I think the Fed proved beyond any reasonable doubt that it
does have a backbone and that it is willing to fight inflation even
in an election year,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey
G. Lanston & Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
   But, tightening the money supply now, Jones argued, could be
both good politics and good economics. Moving now, rather than next
week, avoids imposing bad news on the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans. And, moving now may avoid a more
wrenching action later.
   ``If they had not done it now, they may have been forced to
tighten right in the teeth of an election,'' Jones said. ``The
timing is just about right. We may now at least have a shot at a
soft landing, which is the way we can have sustained
non-inflationary growth.''
   Tuesday's discount rate increase was the second rate hike since
Alan Greenspan became Fed chairman a year ago. In September the
central bank boosted the rate from 5.5 percent to 6 percent, the
first increase in three years.
   Last year's increase was seen by analysts as Greenspan's
attempt, a month after succeeding the respected Paul Volcker, to
establish his inflation-fighting credentials. But, some later
criticized it as one of the factors precipitating the October stock
market crash.

<HEAD>Administration Says `Guidance' Enough to Halt Beach Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration says ``education and
guidance'' should be sufficient to halt the waves of dirty needles
and other infectious debris that have made East Coast beach
closures routine this summer.
   Jeffrey D. Denit of the Environmental Protection Agency said
Tuesday that the agency has no plans to impose regulations for
medical waste disposal, despite a chorus of congressional criticism
and public complaints.
   He told a House subcommittee that educational efforts will
remain the administration's key to fighting the medical waste
problem and federal regulations will be used only if those fail.
   But the congressional Office of Technology Assessment said
continuing reports of hospital waste floating up on shores from
Massachusetts to North Carolina are graphic reminders of a
beleaguered system that lacks federal standards.
   ``No federal standards exist which comprehensively address the
handling, transportation, treatment and disposal of biomedical
waste,'' said Kathryn D. Wagner, an analyst for OTA, the technical
research arm of Congress. She added that ``less than a handful (of
states) have truly comprehensive regulations.''
   OTA, in a preliminary assessment of the nation's biomedical
waste problem, said the debris-ridden beaches are ``symptoms of a
deeper problem of inconsistency, confusion and a lack of
coordination both at and between every level of management.''
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Business
subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, called the
hearing in the wake of a recent spate of beach closings.
   Beaches in New Jersey and New York have been the hardest hit,
but hospital debris also has been reported in Connecticut, Rhode
Island, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina and on the Lake
Erie shore in Ohio.
   ``This summer's medical waste problem is far more serious than
the bloody syringes and vile specimens that have washed up,'' Wyden
said. ``These foul products are only the residue of a national
waste management system that is broken and overloaded.''
   Wyden accused federal agencies of ``bungling'' the medical waste
problem and attacked EPA for failing to set minimum standards for
handling, transporting and disposing of medical wastes under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
   He also said the federal Centers for Disease Control have failed
to recommend guidelines for waste handling and that the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration has not acted to
protect health care workers from exposure to AIDS and hepatitis.
   But Denit said EPA rejects mandatory regulations.
   ``EPA's ongoing educational and technical assistance efforts
should be sufficient to resolve these issues,'' said Denit, deputy
director of the Office of Solid Waste. ``EPA will consider
regulations only if education and guidance fail to improve current
management practices.''
   Denit added that studies indicate hospital waste is ``generally
less virulent than typical domestic waste.''
   Nevertheless, Congress is considering a variety of measures to
toughen penalties and create a system to track hospital waste.
   The Senate voted 97-0 Tuesday to ban the dumping of sludge off
the New York-New Jersey coast after 1991. The measure included an
amendment by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., banning the
disposal of medical waste in oceans and streams and another by Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., providing a five-year prison sentence for
anyone caught violating the ban.
   OTA researchers plan to issue a report early next year on solid
waste issues, including medical waste. But in a preliminary
briefing given by Wagner to the subcommittee, the agency concluded:
   _Lack of federal regulation has created a situation in which
states, fearful that a neighboring state's more stringent law would
bring added medical waste to their jurisdictions, are
``leap-frogging one another to adopt the most stringent
regulations.''
   _Evidence exists that hospitals and other health-care employers,
in an attempt to limit liability, are requiring workers to sign
forms stating they have been trained in handling infectious
materials after receiving only minimal training.
   _The majority of biomedical waste is now incinerated on-site,
but increasing state emission control regulations may lead more
hospitals to hire waste haulers, creating the potential for more
transportation hazards and abuse by contractors trying to save
money by dumping the waste in the ocean.
   Rhode Island Attorney General James E. O'Neil showed the
subcommittee a respirator tube, a colostomy bag, a blood-encrusted
needle and other hospital waste that state officials have collected
in recent weeks from Rhode Island's shores.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman called for strict
federal penalties and jail sentences for illegal dumpers and a
manifest system to track the route of hospital throwaways.
   ``Infectious waste is essentially a loaded gun and should be
legally recognized as such,'' Holtzman said.

   ``Are you Catholic? Do you know what penance
means? That's what it's like to be a Republican in Massachusetts.''
   The words come from an aide to a top Republican state
legislator, but they sum up the sentiments of most Massachusetts
Republicans, long the political minority in the state.
   The ascendancy of the state's top politician, Democratic
presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis, isn't making life any
easier for the state's Republicans _ who are outnumbered by
Democrats 4 to 1.
   Republicans have not won a statewide election since 1972. Of the
state's 11 congressmen, one is Republican. Only 33 of 160 members
of the state House of Representatives are Republican and unless
Republicans win two state Senate seats this fall, they won't have
enough votes to demand a roll call.
   Recent figures show that only 12.8 percent of the state's voters
are Republican, compared with 46.7 percent who are Democrats.
   ``We'll say, let's have a caucus, is there a phone booth
available?'' said former state Rep. and current White House aide
Andrew Card.
   Still, Republicans like Joe Malone act optimistically. Malone
has to, because he may be the GOP's ultimate long-odds guy as the
challenger of Edward M. Kennedy this November for the U.S. Senate
seat Kennedy has held since 1962.
   ``When you're bucking a well-entrenched establishment, you have
to be tenacious, persistent and look for areas of growth,'' said
Malone, 33.
   All state Republicans hope that 1988 will begin to erase the
embarrassment of two years ago, when a pair of Republican primary
candidates for governor were forced from the ticket in disgrace.
One had falsified his resume, and it was reported that the
secretary of the other candidate walked into his office one morning
and found him nude. A third had to be called in at the last minute
to run against the heavily favored Dukakis.
   ``I compare us to the Red Sox: we have all this potential,''
said Polly Logan, the Republican national committeewoman and
legendary fund-raiser, who comes from a family of powerful
Massacusetts Democrats.
   State Republicans first lost their footing at the turn of the
century when Irish immigrants realized their political potential
and began their domination of state politics.
   Many of the traditional Boston Brahmin Republicans like former
Ambassador to the United Nations Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., former Sen.
Leverett Saltonstall and former Sen. Sinclair Weeks Sr. are dead.
Others, like former Gov. Francis Sargent, former U.S. Attorney
General Elliot Richardson, former state Sen. William Saltonstall
and former State Committee Chairman John Sears are no longer very
active in the party.
   Malone is an example of the new Massacusetts Republican. One of
seven children born to Italian immigrant parents, he was raised in
working-class Waltham, west of Boston and a world apart from the
tiny suburbs of the North Shore that spawned many old-line
Republican stalwarts.
   His father owned a trucking company and traveled to the Boston
docks every day for shipments. The elder Malone changed his name
from Mulone on the advice of a friend who suggested he would get
better treatment from predominantly Irish longshoremen and police.
   Though Harvard educated, Malone sticks close to his roots and
still lives in Waltham.
   White ethnics like Malone are not unknown in the Republican
Party in Massachusetts. In 1966, John Volpe, an Italian-American
Republican, was elected governor. Party chairman Ray Shamie, a
conservative millionaire who entered state politics fairly
recently, is of Syrian and French descent.
   But for the most part, Malone said, ``the Republican Party was
viewed as representing the haves and the Democrats the have-nots.''
He said some traditional Yankee Republicans have distanced
themselves from his candidacy and prefer to concentrate on George
Bush's presidential campaign.
   Saltonstall, the former state senator and son of Leverett
Saltonstall, said that's untrue. ``We think he's great,'' he said.
``We're glad to work with him.''

   The financially strapped United Nations
created a $74 million observer corps Tuesday to monitor a truce
between Iran and Iraq, but the secretary-general said, ``I simply
do not have the money'' to pay for it.
   Marrack Goulding, undersecretary-general in charge of
peacekeeping operations, said the General Assembly probably would
be summoned to special session this week to assess funds from the
membership.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told an American
reporter: ``You should advise your government to participate fully
in these efforts for peace.''
   The United States, which supports U.N. peacemaking in the
Persian Gulf and Afghanistan, has fallen $467 million behind in its
U.N. payments over several years. It is assessed more than $200
million annually, one-quarter of the regular budget.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said: ``I think the United
States will meet its obligations and make its payments.''
   The New York Times reported in Wednesday editions that the
United States is asking Arab countries of the Persian Gulf to pay a
higher share of the cost of the peacekeeping force, and that such a
sum could amount to $20 million.
   It quoted Assistant Secretary of State Richard S. Williamson as
saying the U.S. asked the Arab countries for a ``special voluntary
contribution toward the cost of the monitoring force, since they
are the chief beneficiaries.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration welcomed the cease-fire announcement and would bear
``its fair share of the cost'' of the observer force, including
transportation and equipment.
   ``It is our understanding that there will be neither U.S. nor
Soviet troops in the observer force,'' he added. ``It has been a
major aim of the United States to bring this war to an end.''
   Perez de Cuellar announced Monday that a cease-fire will begin
Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old war, which has killed or wounded more
than 1 million people and cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The
Security Council created the observer group, which is part of the
truce agreement.
   Twenty-five countries will provide the 350 unarmed observers,
paying the members they assign. The $74 million, including $47
million in start-up costs, will cover the initial six-month
authorization.
   Goulding told The Associated Press some observers already were
on their way to the Persian Gulf. He would not say how many or what
countries they represented.
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark announced Tuesday in Ottawa
that Canada will contribute 385 military personnel to the
peacekeeping force, mostly communications specialists. They are
expected to start arriving in the region Wednesday.
   A U.N. naval force, the first in its history, also may be
created to patrol the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway that forms
the southern border between Iran and Iraq.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said the United States will
withdraw most of its naval forces from the gulf only when it is
convinced the cease-fire has taken effect.
   This will be the seventh U.N. peacekeeping or observer group
created by the 159-member organization. The others operate in
Afghanistan, Cyprus, Lebanon, India, Pakistan, Syria and Jerusalem,
the last two resulting from Arab-Israeli wars in 1973 and 1948,
respectively.
   In Iraq, state television announced the cease-fire declaration
after midnight, declaring victory in the war and three days of
celebration. Fireworks exploded over the Tigris River and tens of
thousands of rounds of ammunition were fired into the air.
   Tehran radio reported the truce at 7 a.m. Tuesday, and Iranians
generally greeted it with relief tempered by skepticism about
prospects for a lasting peace. The military commander and
parlimament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Iran will not attack
but its soldiers will be prepared to repel the enemy.
   Perez de Cuellar is expected to ask the General Assembly for a
special assessment on members in proportion to their regular
contributions. That means Washington would be expected to pay the
largest share.
   ``I proceed on the assumption that the United States will come
up with its full assessment of 25 percent or more,`` Goulding told
a news conference.
   Walters said in his remarks to reporters after the Security
Council meeting: ``This proves definitively that the United Nations
has a purpose, that it is useful to all peace-loving countries,
including the United States of America. It has stopped the biggest
war since World War II.''
   Goulding would not identify the 25 countries that will
contribute soldiers and other personnel to the U.N. Iran-Iraq
Military Observer Group. He said the list might be announced
Wednesday, after approval and diplomatic formalities.
   The five permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Britain, China, France and Soviet Union _ won't provide personnel
because the United Nations wants to avoid involvement by the major
powers.
   Contributing nations will be chosen by geographical
distribution, Goulding said. Japan, which never sends troops, is
expected to provide medical, communications and other personnel in
addition to $10 million.
   Among nations expected to send soldiers are Algeria, Austria,
Denmark, Fiji, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Norway, Sweden, Turkey
and Yugoslavia.
   ``We expect to have an impressive body of observers deployed in
Iran and Iraq in time to observe a cease-fire,'' Goulding said.
``We certainly will try to have all 350 men there by D-Day,'' the
term Perez de Cuellar has used to describe Aug. 20.
   The United States has withheld funds from the United Nations
over several years for political reasons and as a means of
compelling it to introduce budgetary and other reforms.

<HEAD>Senators Take Oath For Hastings Impeachment Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a ceremony as old as their legislative
body, senators have sworn to ``do impartial justice'' in the
impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings, but the
trial won't happen until next year.
   It was like a page of history Tuesday as senators became judges
and jurors in an impeachment case for only the 13th time in their
history.
   But the proceeding did more for history buffs than for advancing
the impeachment case, as Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va. announced that time constraints in the 100th Congress will
make a trial impossible until next year.
   Hastings, who was not present at the Senate session, is the
first defendant to be impeached after winning acquittal on similar
charges at a criminal trial. He also is the first black impeachment
defendant.
   The House formally presented 17 articles of impeachment, along
with its recommendation that the Miami jurist be ousted for
committing ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
   Language in the oath used to swear in senators, and in a
proclamation ordering them to keep silent ``on the pain of
imprisonment,'' was adopted for the first impeachment case in
December 1798.
   The Senate at that time dismissed charges against Sen. William
Blount of Tennessee, saying a senator could not be impeached.
   The House voted 413-3 on Aug. 3 to impeach Hastings, accusing
him of: participating in a bribery conspiracy; lying about the
conspiracy at his criminal trial; leaking confidential wiretap
information, and discrediting the federal judiciary.
   Impeachment is the way Congress removes federal officials from
office, especially federal judges who are appointed for life. After
the House votes for impeachment, akin to an indictment, the Senate
conducts a trial in which conviction requires a two-thirds majority
of those present and voting.
   Senators approved a summons directing Hastings to answer the
impeachment articles by Sept. 8.
   The Rules Committee was asked to report by Sept. 23 on whether
the Senate should use a committee to hear the evidence before the
case is presented to the full chamber. That system was used for the
first time in the last impeachment trial, which resulted in the
conviction of Harry E. Claiborne and his removal as a U.S. district
judge in Las Vegas, Nev.
   The committee also is to report on the authority of the Senate
to receive impeachment articles in one Congress and conduct a trial
in another. House precedents show it has been done twice before.
   On Tuesday, House ``managers'' _ who function as prosecutors _
were led into the chamber by the House and Senate sergeants at
arms, with chief manager Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., at the head
of the line.
   Rodino, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was followed
by fellow committee members Hamilton Fish of New York, the ranking
Republican on the panel; John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the
subcommittee that investigated Hastings; George Gekas of
Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee; and Rep.
John Bryant, D-Texas.
   While they sat at tables at the front of the chamber, Senate
Sergeant At Arms Henry Giugni intoned a traditional proclamation:
   ``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye: All persons are commanded to keep
silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives
is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of
impeachment against Alcee L. Hastings, judge of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida.''
   Rodino then read every word of the 17 impeachment articles. And
when he finished, traditional words were heard again as senators
were sworn in:
   ``You do solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the
trial of the impeachment of Judge Alcee L. Hastings, a judge of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida,
now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the
Constitution and laws. So help you God.''
   The second most senior senator, Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., first
swore in the senior senator, John Stennis, D-Miss. Stennis then
swore in third-ranking Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis. Proxmire then
swore in the rest of the Senate.
   The House has impeached 15 federal officials in its history.
Twelve cases have gone to trial in the Senate. Two officials
resigned prior to Senate proceedings and five _ all federal judges
_ have been convicted by the Senate and removed from office.

<HEAD>Town Troubled By Woodstock's 20th Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Woodstock, the rock festival that came to
symbolize the 1960s for a generation of Americans, is again at the
center of a controversy, this time over how big its 20th
anniversary celebration should be.
   On one side is the Bethel Town Board, which meets tonight to
discuss whether to allow voters decide what to do about next
August's anniversary. If a referendum is agreed upon, it would be
placed on November's ballot, Town Supervisor Alan Scott said
Tuesday.
   On the other side are concert promoters who want to re-create
the original Woodstock, which wasn't actually held in that Ulster
County town but miles away on Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, Sullivan
County.
   Scott said his town is against any rock extravaganza on the
scale of the first Woodstock, which drew nearly a half million
people and endured heavy rains, lack of food and sanitation
facilities, drug overdoses and massive traffic jams.
   Scott said the town wants to recognize the anniversary, but in a
low-key manner. The problems created during the 1969 festival are
still fresh in the minds of residents, he said.
   ``It really raised havoc in this area,'' Scott said. ``It was a
thorn in the side of many, many residents at the time.''
   He said that as a result of the three-day concert held Aug.
15-17, 1969, the town passed a mass assembly law that prohibits
gatherings of more than 10,000 people.
   In August 1986, town officials did erect a roadside marker at
the site of the concert.
   Scott said at least five promoters have approached the town
board this year about staging another Woodstock festival.
   Some have talked about bringing back such Woodstock performers
as Country Joe Fish and Richie Havens, Scott said.
   Other performers, such as Crosby, Stills & Nash, and Santana,
still draw large concert crowds today.
   ``The general feeling is that we certainly don't want any
massive gathering anywhere near the proportion of what we had,''
Scott said.
   Scott said the board already has rejected a promoter's offer of
$200,000 to allow the concert to be staged.
   ``We recognize the importance of the event, we realize the
historical significance, but we are looking for something tasteful,
not more than a one-day event and not more than 10,000 people,'' he
said.
   In August 1984, the 15th anniversary of Woodstock was celebrated
at the posh Grossinger's Resort and Country Club in Grossinger,
N.Y., about 5 miles from Yasgur's farm.
   About 700 people showed up, including Abbie Hoffman and
Woodstock performers John Sebastian and David Clayton Thomas.

<HEAD>Canada Free Trade Pact Wins By Strong Margin in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blueprints for abolishing most tariffs and
many other barriers to trade with Canada are headed for a Senate
vote this week after winning a strong endorsement in the House.
   ``This is the crowning achievement of this president and this
administration'' on the trade front, Rep. Philip M. Crane, R-Ill.,
said as the House voted 366-40 to approve the pact signed in
January by President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney.
   The bill would authorize the president to phase out most tariffs
on Canadian imports over the next decade. It also envisions ending
an array of other trade restrictions.
   The Senate is expected to act on the measure this week and send
it to Reagan's desk. It won approval Tuesday from the Senate
Finance Committee.
   But Canadian counterpart legislation is stalled in that nation's
appointive Senate, where it is running into Liberal Party
opposition.
   Lawmakers here are saying the agreement is needed in part as a
balance to rising protectionism within the European Economic
Community.
   ``Many Europeans are talking about free trade as being something
for Europeans within that bloc _ I hope they don't go that way,''
said Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
   The agreement would not set up a common market between the
United States and Canada. That would mean adopting the same set of
tariffs for products produced in third countries.
   The free-trade agreement allows the United States and Canada to
maintain their own set of third-country tariffs while dropping most
tariffs on the annual $166 billion in goods and services traded
across their common border.
   The United States already has a free-trade agreement with Israel.
   Tariffs currently apply to about 25 percent of U.S.-Canada trade.
   Advocates claim the pact will result in increased U.S. exports
and resulting jobs while lowering consumer prices. But some
industries are complaining that they are likely to get hurt.
   The blueprint immediately would drop 10 percent of existing
tariffs applying to goods ranging from telecommunications gear to
whiskey and rum. The rest would be phased out over 10 years.
   Under the pact, it would become easier for Americans to invest
in Canada and Canadians to invest in this country. Barriers to a
wide array of exports of services would be swept away, but
transportation and cultural services would be exempted.
   The agreement would eliminate barriers to import and export of
crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, coal, electricity,
uranium and other nuclear fuels.
   Tariffs on autos and auto parts, which account for a third of
trade between the two countries, would be eliminated. Ninety-five
percent of such trade between the two countries already moves
without tariffs.
   To get the duty-free treatment, however, autos and auto parts
would have to be 50 percent manufactured in North America. The
provision is aimed at Japanese and Korean auto assembly plants in
Canada.
   Auto-state lawmakers for the most part supported the measure,
based on a promise that U.S. trade officials would try to negotiate
a provision under which duty-free treatment would be restricted to
automotive products with a minimum of 60 percent North American
content.
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said the agreement ``would leave us
with Canadian agricultural markets that are largely closed to
American agricultural producers and American markets that are
largely open to Canadian agricultural producers, and I'm concerned
about that.''
   A chief problem, he said, have been Canadian rail subsidies for
grain shipped throught that country's big port at Thunder Bay, Ont.
American producers receive nothing comparable and thus are at a
disadvantage, he said.
   Under the pact, the Canadians agreed to end rail subsidies for
grain shipped through their West Coast port of Vancouver.
   Rep. Hal Daub, R-Neb., said he was confident that the measure
would protect not only wheat but corn, sugar and dry edible beans
from a wave of Canadian imports.
   He also said the agreement would raise the prospects of success
in the current Uruguay Round of trade talks and thus end ``the
subsidy shootout in which the only winners are the giddy, greedy
buyers, happily snatching up agricultural commodities at prices
below the cost of production.''

<HEAD>Dutchmen Expelled For Lighting Cigarettes With Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Dutch tourists spotted lighting
cigarettes with Yugoslav money have been fined and expelled, the
state news agency Tanjug reported.
   In a report Tuesday, it identified the two as Peeters Hendrikus,
25, and Peeters Hermanus, 36, but gave no other details of the
incident in the Adriatic resort of Makarska.
   Yugoslavia's currency, the dinar, has fallen rapidly in value as
the country remains gripped by triple-digit inflation.
   With a dollar now worth around 3,000 dinars, and the largest
denomination note a 20,000 dinar bill, 100 dinar bills have become
virtually worthless.

<HEAD>``60 Minutes'' Tops Ratings; NBC Wins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shows are reruns, and so are the A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings. NBC won again last week. NBC won the whole
month of July, and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was the top-ranked show,
with old news.
   ``60 Minutes,'' a consistent top 10 show, made it to the top on
Sunday with reports on Disney studio chief Michael Eisner, an
interview with Billionaire Boys Club founder and convicted murderer
Joe Hunt, and a report on Brazilian men getting away with murdering
their wives.
   The rest of last week's top 10 shows were ``Golden Girls,''
``Cheers'' and a fourth-place tie between ``Different World'' and
``His Mistress,'' all on NBC; ``A Case of Deadly Force'' on CBS; a
three-way tie among ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Night Court,'' both of
NBC, and CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote''; and ``ALF'' on NBC.
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 10.7 and an average
share of 21 percent of the viewing audience, followed by CBS with
10.2 and a 20 share and ABC with 8.6 and a 17 share.
   Each rating point represents 886,000 homes with television.
   For the July sweeps period, NBC averaged 11.2, followed by CBS
at 9.1 and ABC at 9.0. Ratings in sweeps months, which are often
sweetened by special programming, are used to determine advertising
rates.
   For the 46 weeks of this season, NBC's average rating is 14.8,
followed by CBS' 12.5 and ABC's 12.4.
   CBS won the evening news ratings with a 9.0 rating for the week,
while ABC and NBC tied at 8.6.

   NASA began the final countdown
Tuesday for firing the space shuttle Discovery's huge main engines,
a hot-fire test that must be passed before the craft can make its
long-delayed return to space.
   The 22-second firing of Discovery's three engines was set for
7:30 a.m. EDT Wednesday. Weather conditions appeared favorable.
   Kennedy Space Center's countdown clocks, frozen at the 11-hour
mark after a similar test was scrubbed last week, began ticking at
6:10 p.m. as scheduled. The countdown included three ``hold''
periods totaling two hours and 20 minutes for any time-consuming
tasks that might crop up.
   At 11:50 p.m., the launch team began pumping 385,000 gallons of
liquid hydrogen and 143,000 gallons of liquid oxygen propellant
into Discovery's 154-foot-tall external fuel tank.
   Engineers made a late computer change to avoid a possible
recurrence of last week's test shutdown when an electronic sensor
erroneously indicated that a valve was not closing properly on the
No. 2 engine.
   Although the offending unit was replaced, engineers worried that
a valve sensor on the No. 3 engine might also be error prone and
repeat the scrub. Rather than replace the position indicator, they
changed computer instructions to allow more leeway in the report of
the valve's position.
   The engines were expected to develop 1.1 million pounds of
thrust, but use only a fraction of the fuel.
   Discovery was fastened to its launch pad by eight bolts, each
three feet long and three inches in diameter. During the test, each
engine was to fire on a staggered schedule that totals 22 seconds.
The two solid fuel booster rockets that flank the shuttle tank were
not to be ignited.
   The test has been delayed five times because of problems with
ground equipment and, Thursday, because an electronic sensor
mistakenly reported a closed valve as open.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it will
announce a launch date for Discovery after the engines and ship are
certified for flight. The date has slipped from July last year to
February, then June, then mid-August, then late September. It
appears now to be possible no earlier than October.
   When Discovery finally flies, with a five-man crew, it will end
a 2{-year near-hiatus in American space activity that began with
the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986.
   NASA normally performs shuttle flight readiness tests only on
new ships. But it is requiring them for Discovery, which has flown
six times, because of the many modifications on both ship and
engines and because of the length of time since the last mission.

On Patients</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Safety tests using AIDS patients are beginning
Wednesday on a new type of genetically engineered drug which
researchers hope will open new avenues to attack the virus that
causes the disease.
   The drug, called CD4, mimics a protein normally found on the
surface of certain immune system cells that are susceptible to the
AIDS virus.
   Researchers hope the experimental drug will, in effect, fool the
deadly virus into harmlessly attaching itself to the injected
substance rather than latching onto similar receptors on immune
system cells.
   Approval for the tests beginning on AIDS patients at the
National Cancer Institute was obtained several months ago. Similar
studies are to begin in a few days at San Francisco General
Hospital and New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.
   About 50 patients will be involved in the first round of tests,
designed to determine the safety of the drug rather than its
effectiveness. However, scientists also will be looking for
evidence the drug, manufactured by Genetech Inc., of San Francisco,
counters the growth of the virus by enticing it to attach to the
cells of the drug rather than to immune system cells.

   Six-year-old John Peter Mavraganis is
connoisseur of garbage disposal.
   He sketches garbage trucks for fun. The weekly trash pickup is
like a trip to the candy store. He has memorized the names of area
trash-disposal companies by studying the Yellow Pages.
   His passion runs so deep that he talked his baby sitter into
writing a letter to Eastern Waste Industries, his favorite, to
request the company fulfill his dream: a ride on a garbage truck.
   Saturday morning, after a sleepless night of expectation, John
Peter boarded a truck and headed out with a driver. It was heaven.
   ``He's still flying high,'' said his mother, Libby Mavraganis.
``All day, he's either drawing EWI trucks or out playing Dumpster.''
   The disposal company had never received such a request.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Bob Schwartzberg, an
assistant division manager. ``I told his mother that if I would
have known about him a couple months earlier I would have hired him
as a salesman.''
   Mrs. Mavraganis attributes her son's strange fascination to an
intense interest in mechanics; instead of bedtime stories, he asks
her to read helicopter specifications to him.
   ``He says he likes the garbage trucks because they're big and
made of steel and can pick up the Dumpster. He spots that hydraulic
arm and goes crazy.''

   Driving instructor Bruce Carden
wasn't about to change his style of teaching for a new student, and
he told her so.
   ``He said `I may hit you; I may swear; I may grab your arm.' And
I almost said `Forget it,''' recalled Sister Francine Sartor, a
60-year-old Roman Catholic nun.
   But Sister Sartor accepted Carden's gruff terms, and in three
weeks proved to be the best student driver Carden says he has
taught.
   For three weeks, the two set out on Haywood County's highways
and back roads.
   On their last outing he guided Sister Sartor to the driver's
license office.
   ``She said, `Will you pray with me?' And I'm telling you, she
prayed to every saint in the heaven. I never knew there were so
many,'' Carden said.
   Sister Sartor passed each part of her driving test, coming
within one answer of a perfect score on the written portion.

   He married a movie actress and now he's
Hollywood-bound, but it's clear the city that won Wayne Gretzky
renown as the greatest ice hockey player of his time has scored
more than a few points with him.
   Gretzky said at a news conference Tuesday that he wanted the
trade from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings for
personal reasons, ``for the benefit of Wayne Gretzky, my new wife
and our expected child in the new year.''
   Then, the Great Gretzky was overcome with emotion.
   ``There comes a time when ...,'' he said before pausing. He
rubbed bleary eyes trying to regain his composure, then seemed to
give up. Without continuing, he stood up and walked away from the
microphones.
   Gretzky said his wife, Los Angeles-based actress Janet Jones,
did not ask him to seek a trade. ``It's my own gut feeling,'' he
said. The two were married July 16.
   Gretzky led the Oilers to four Stanley Cup championships in the
last five seasons. He holds or shares 49 National Hockey League
scoring records.
   The trade involved four other players, three first-round draft
choices and more than $10 million.
   Oilers' president Glen Sather, also with tears in his eyes, said
he hated to trade Gretzky but it was a good deal ``for Wayne, the
Oilers and the National Hockey League.''
   But Oiler fans reacted swiftly to news of the trade. Callers
jammed the 21 telephone lines at the team offices, some threatening
to cancel season tickets.

<HEAD>Dukakis Record Causes Concern Behind The Scenes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Behind the facade of non-partisanship that
characterized the recent meeting of the nations's governors were
some highly partisan discussions of Michael Dukakis' role in his
state's economic revival.
   Among Republicans at the National Governors' Association that
ended Tuesday, there was clear concern that Dukakis has scored well
among voters with an appeal that emphasizes his tenure as steward
of the so-called ``Massachusetts Miracle.''
   As Republicans prepare to nominate George Bush for president,
they hope to use their national convention, opening Monday in New
Orleans, to raise questions about the Dukakis record. They hope to
portray a vote for the Democrat as risking a reversal of the
economic and foreign policy gains they claim as the legacy of
Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   Among the Democratic governors at the bipartisan National
Governors' Association meeting, there was a determination to keep
the message of ``competence'' before the voters in their states.
   ``We have one of our own running, one we have consistently
admired not just politically but intellectually,'' said Gov. Jim
Blanchard of Michigan, chairman of the Democratic Governors'
Association, after a strategy session Tuesday with Dukakis.
   Dukakis responded that his Democratic colleagues ``are going to
be an essential part of this campaign.''
   As expected, voters will get a sharply different picture of the
Dukakis record from his Republican colleagues.
   At a meeting the same day of the Republican Governors'
Association, statistics were distributed designed to show that the
Massachusetts economy is lagging behind other New England states,
all of which are enjoying a boom.
   The GOP numbers compared employment statistics in 1982 and 1987
and said that Massachusetts ranked last among the six New England
states in the percentage increase in new jobs.
   Using the same two years for comparison, the GOP figures ranked
Massachusetts fourth in the percentage increase in housing starts.
   The GOP governors also received Labor Department statistics
comparing the job growth between January 1983 and January 1988,
numbers that showed Massachusetts ranked 33rd in the nation.
   But the Republicans also were stuck with figures that showed
Dukakis' home state ranked first in New England in the increase in
per capita income and had the region's second lowest unemployment
rate.
   The effort to chip away at the Dukakis record was part of a GOP
strategy that became increasingly apparent at the governors'
meeting as well as in New Orleans.
   In an appearance before the Republican platform committee, Vice
President Bush described his opponent as the ``stealth candidate''
for keeping his position on issues invisible.
   And at the governors' meeting, Republican Gov. George Deukmejian
of California said, ``The only thing the Democrats have going for
them is their saying it's time for a change.''
   But while Republican governors were trying to portray Dukakis as
an unknown quantiy, they also were prodding Bush to make his vision
clearer to the voters.
   ``I don't think George Bush has been able to articulate his
vision to the satisfaction of voters in Wisconsin,'' said that
state's Republican governor, Tommy Thompson.
   ``People are confused about his views on the issues,'' said
another Bush supporter, Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey.
   Meanwhile, Democratic governors clearly were pleased that
Dukakis has made a point of including them in his campaign.
   Blanchard recalled that four years ago, Democratic nominee
Walter Mondale didn't meet with his party's governors until October.
   ``The fact that we are having this meeting in early August bodes
well,'' he said.

   Defendants in a lawsuit challenging the
will of the late Liberace testified Tuesday that in the weeks
before his death he was alert and active, rather than barely able
to walk or speak, as his housekeeper says.
   Dora Liberace, sister-in-law of the famed pianist and a
defendant in the lawsuit, said Liberace offered a toast at a
Christmas dinner, saying ``Next year we'll all be together again.''
He died six weeks later of complications from AIDS.
   A day earlier, Dorothy McMahon, Liberace's housekeeper for 16
years and a plaintiff in the suit, had testified that he could not
even bathe himself without assistance on the day he supposedly
reviewed his will.
   Liberace's sister and four others have charged that Liberace's
health was failing rapidly at Christmas time of 1986 and that he
was physically unable to comprehend a will and trust he signed four
weeks after the holiday celebration.
   Liberace died Feb. 4, 1987, two weeks after signing a will and
trust that left Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer Joel Strote as
executor of the vast estate and head of the Liberace Foundation for
the Performing Arts.
   Those filing the suit contend that Strote has taken excessive
fees as head of the foundation.
   But testimony Tuesday indicated Strote's efforts had made money
for the foundation, and that the assets of the Liberace estate had
climbed from $14 million to $18 million under his guidance.
   Wayne Williams, an executive of First Interstate Bank, said a
check of records indicated Strote had saved the estate $1.1 million.
   Dora Liberace testified she sided with Strote in a bitter split
over control of the foundation, which provides scholarships to
nearly 30 colleges and universities.
   The wife of the late George Liberace testified of bitter
feelings between family members, and said she had been told she was
not welcome in the family. She currently runs the Liberace museum
in Las Vegas and is administrator of the foundation.
   George Liberace played straight man for his famous brother on
Liberace's popular television show in the 1950s. He moved to Las
Vegas in 1979 to start the museum.
   Dora Liberace testified Tuesday that Cary James, Liberace's
companion for six years before his death, had wanted to take
control of the foundation.
   Strote met with Liberace Jan. 15, 1987 and negotiated a new will
and trust, leaving him in charge of both. Liberace signed the
documents _ numbering more than 100 pages _ a week later at his
Palm Springs home. He slipped into a coma Feb. 1 and died Feb. 4.
   Dora Liberace and her daughter, Donna Mathews, testified Tuesday
that Liberace was alert and active when they went to his home for
the Christmas celebration in 1986.
   The sister-in-law said the subject of AIDS had surfaced in the
spring of 1986, shortly after Liberace had entered Valley Hospital
in Las Vegas for a series of tests.
   She recalled a time when Liberace came to pick her up for a
dinner engagement.
   ``He sat down on the divan and said `Dora, I do not have AIDS,'
'' she testified. ``Nothing else was said.''
   Plaintiffs in the suit are Liberace's sister, Angie;
housekeepers McMahon and Gladys Luckie; long-time manager Seymour
Heller and James.

   Two of the more than 6,000 Californians whose
bank accounts have gone unclaimed for more than seven years were
particularly easy for the state to find: President Reagan and
Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   State Controller Gray Davis said Tuesday the state has returned
$3,492 to Reagan from a dormant campaign fund account stemming from
his eight years as governor of California.
   Meese, who served as Reagan's state legal affairs secretary in
1967, also recently received $9,095 from a personal account left by
his late father, Edwin Meese Jr.
   Under California law, accounts that have been inactive for seven
years or more are turned over for safekeeping to the controller's
office, which has amassed a trust of more than $375 million in 1.1
million individual accounts.
   So far, more than $3 million has been returned to 6,000 people
with such accounts, including $131,000 returned to charities and
civic organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of America.
   Davis, a Democrat, said he even found $94.96 that appears to
belong to Republican Gov. George Deukmejian.

   Actor Peter O'Toole wept with joy upon
hearing that a judge granted him custody of his 5-year-old son
during the school year, his attorney said.
   ``Peter O'Toole is a fabulous father,'' said attorney Jeffrey P.
Weinstein. ``He was not performing in court.''
   Superior Court Judge Alexander D. Lehrer ruled Tuesday that
Lorcan O'Toole will live with his mother, Karen Somerville O'Toole,
during school holidays in December and April and in the summer.
   ``I think she hoped to have been given the opportunity to
educate the boy ... but she will abide by the judge's decision,''
said her attorney, Gary Newman.
   In May, a judge in London ordered O'Toole to return his son to
Ms. Somerville O'Toole so the courts in New Jersey could decide
which parent should get permanent custody of the boy.
   The Irish-born O'Toole, 56, met Ms. Somerville O'Toole, 38, six
years ago when she lived in California. Ms. Somerville O'Toole, who
was never married to the actor but took his name, now lives in
Navesink, N.J., and New York City.

   Arsenio Hall, who co-stars in the hit movie
``Coming to America'' with fellow comedian Eddie Murphy, plans to
host a new TV talk show beginning next year.
   ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' set to debut Jan. 2, marks Hall's
second attempt at a nightly interview program. Hall had served as
host of ``The Late Show'' on Fox Broadcasting until earlier this
year when the program was replaced.
   During a news conference Tuesday, Hall said his show ``will try
to do something different. ... Every night is going to be a party.
We're going to have a lot of fun.''
   The one-hour program will be distributed by Paramount Domestic
Television, and has been sold to eight of the nation's top 10
television markets.
   ``Coming to America'' has grossed $100 million at theaters since
it opened early last month.

   Critics have liked Michael Keaton's dramatic
portrayal of a drug addict in ``Clean and Sober,'' but the actor
says the praise shouldn't extend to his character.
   ``I thought there was nothing redeemable about this guy. There
was nothing likeable about him,'' Keaton said of the movie that's
being released today.
   It was the second movie role Keaton accepted with reluctance,
the first being the box-office hit ``Beetlejuice.''
   It was also a dramatic departure for the star of ``Mr. Mom,''
``Johnny Dangerously'' and ``Nightshift.''
   ``Beetlejuice'' director Tim Burton, who will be directing
Keaton and Jack Nicholson in the forthcoming futuristic ``Batman,''
said Keaton is going through a sort of renaissance.
   ``He's one of the few comedic actors that can bridge that gap to
drama,'' said Burton.

   Nina Siemaszko has a featured role in
Francis Ford Coppola's latest movie ``Tucker,'' but the 18-year-old
actress says she gladly gave up attending the premiere to be at a
youth camp.
   Even so, she says, missing the gala event was not easy with
people like Dustin Hoffman, Robert Duvall and Warren Beatty
attending the party.
   Since she was 3, Siemaszko has spent her summers at Camp Norwid,
a Polish Youth Association camp about 20 miles west of Crivitz in
northeastern Wisconsin. This year she's working as a volunteer
counselor at the camp.
   ``I know I always can come back here,'' Siemaszko said recently.
``I missed the premiere of `Tucker' because I was here. I love
doing this.''
   Siemaszko plays the daughter of Preston Tucker in the movie that
opens Friday about a man whose revolutionary car sparked a power
struggle in the automobile industry in 1946.

   Here are highlights from the preliminary
``working papers'' that the Republican Platform Committee is using
to fashion the party's 1988 platform.
   The seven issue papers, totaling nearly 30,000 words, underwent
revision by platform subcommittees Tuesday before being sent to the
full committee to be put in final form by Friday.
   The committee will present the final document to the Republican
National Convention for approval Tuesday.
   Here are excerpts:
   ``America again leads the world, confident of its abilities,
proud of its products, sure of its future, the pacesetter for all
mankind. ... Now the ideological heirs of Carter and Mondale are
trying again to sell the public a false bill of goods. These
Luddite liberals call America's prosperity an illusion.''
   Taxes: ``We oppose any attempts to increase taxes. ...
Republicans unequivocally reiterate the no-tax pledge we have
proudly kept.''
   Deficit: ``We call for structural changes to control government
waste, including a two-year budget cycle, a super-majority
requirement for raising taxes (and) a legislatively enacted
line-item veto. ... We call for a balanced budget amendment to the
Constitution.''
   Family: Calls for imparting to children ``the Judeo-Christian
values of Western civilization and our ideals of liberty.''
   Child care: ``The best care for most children, especially in the
early years, is parental. Government must never hinder it.'' It
promises to ``establish a toddler tax credit for pre-school
children, available to all families of modest means.''
   AIDS: ``Those who suffer from AIDS, their families and the men
and women of medicine who care for the affliced deserve our
compassion and help. ... We will vigorously fight against AIDS. ...
We must not only marshal our scientific resources against AIDS, but
must also protect those who do not have the disease.''
   Social Security: ``We pledge to preserve the integrity of the
Social Security trust funds.''
   Homeless: ``Republicans are determined to help the homeless as a
matter of ethical commitment as well as sound public policy. ...
Homelessness demonstrates the failure of liberalism. It is the
result of Democratic policies in the 1960s and 1970s that disrupted
mental health care, family stability, low-cost housing and the
authority of towns and cities to deal with people in need.''
Promises to address ``root causes'' by strengthening enforcement of
child support laws, improving safety in shelters, educating
homeless children and breaking through red tape ``that keep 1.7
million housing units unrehabilitated and out of use.''
   School prayer: ``Mindful of our religious diversity, we firmly
support the right of students to engage in voluntary prayer in
schools.'' Also, ``The Pledge of Allegiance should be recited daily
in schools in all states.''
   Abortion: ``We believe the unborn child has a fundamental right
to life which cannot be infringed. We ... reaffirm our support for
a human life amendment. ... We oppose the use of public revenues
for abortion. ... We reaffirm our support for the appointment of
judges at all levels of the judiciary who respect traditional
family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.'
   Women: ``We renew our historic commitment to equal rights for
women. ... We must remove remaining obstacles to women's achieving
their full potential and full reward. That does not include the
notion of federally mandated comparable worth.''
   Ethics: ``The Founding Fathers ... would be shocked by
congressional behavior. ... Outright offenses against ethical
standards and public laws are treated lightly. ... We will apply
health and safety laws and civil rights statutes to the Congress.''
   Education: ``No students should be barred from a school, or
assigned to it, because of race. ... We will increase funding for
the Head Start program. ... We will keep the spotlight of public
attention on the college cost spiral. ... We will create a College
Savings Bond program, with tax-exempt interest.''
   Drugs: Opposes legalizing any illicit drug. Urges states ``to
suspend eligibility for a driver's license to anyone convicted of a
drug offense. ... We will encourage tougher penalties for those who
deal drugs near schools or use children to deliver narcotics. ...
To protect residents of public housing, we will evict persons
dealing in drugs.'' It promises, ``We will use our armed forces in
the war on drugs to the maximum extent practical.''
   Welfare: ``Work is an essential component of welfare reform.'
   Energy: Calls for tax incentives ``to encourage exploration for
new oil and to improve he recovery of oil still in place. ... We
support fully decontrolling (natural gas) prices.'' Supports
expansion of ``environmentally safe nuclear power.'
   Soviet relations: ``Americans cannot afford a future
administration which attempts to eagerly embrace perceived _ but as
yet unproven _ changes in Soviet policy, nor can we indulge naive
inexperience, or an overly enthusiastic endorsement of current
Soviet rhetoric. ... We will not leave America unpepared should
reform prove illusory.''
   Anti-communism: ``Republicans proudly reaffirm the Reagan
doctrine: America's commitment to aid freedom fighters against that
which destroys freedom and the human spirit: communist oppression.''
   Nicaragua: Calls it ``a Soviet client state'' that denies basic
rights to its people. ``Today, thousands of Nicaraguans are united
in a struggle to free their homeland from a totalitarian regime.
The Republican Party stands shoulder to shoulder with them in this
struggle, and is committed to assist them, including military aid
if necessary.''
   Cuba: Opposes ``any normalization of relations ... as long as
Fidel Castro continues to oppress the Cuban people at home and
support international terrorism and drug trafficking abroad.''
   Taiwan: ``We reaffirm our commitment to the security of
Taiwan.'' Of ``communist China,'' it says, ``as we draw closer in
friendship, the Republican Party believes that we must continue to
encourage the abandonment of political repression in China and
moves toward freer markets.''
   Middle East: ``Republicans reject the concept of a Palestinian
state between Jordan and Israel. Such a state would pose a grave
threat to the security interests of the United States and Israel,
serving as a breeding ground for future radical and terrorist
activities.'' It says, ``The PLO should have no role in the peace
process unless it recognizes Israel's right to exist.''
   Apartheid: ``Republicans deplore the apartheid system of South
Africa. Republicans call for an effective and coordinated policy
that will promote equal rights and a peaceful transition to a truly
representative constitutional form of government for all South
Africa.'' Says ``actions designed to pressure the government of
South Africa must not have the effect of adversely affecting the
rising aspirations and achievements of black South African
entrepreneurs and workers.''
   Strategic Defense Initiative: ``SDI represents America's single
most important defense program. It is the most significant
investment we can make in our nation's future security. ... We are
commited to deployment of SDI as soon as possible.''
   Arms talks: ``Arms reduction can be an important aspect of our
national policy only when agreements enhance the security of the
United States and its allies. ... We will consistently undertake
necessary improvements in our forces to maintain the credibility of
our deterrent. We will not negotiate in areas which jeopardize our
security,'' particularly SDI.
   Space: ``The Republican Party will re-establish U.S.
pre-eminence in space. ... We must commit to manned flight to Mars
around the year 2000 and to continued exploration of the moon.''

   Georgia Democratic voters nominated former TV actor Ben Jones
Tuesday to run for Congress, while in a preview of November, a
Democrat won a special election in southern Illinois to complete
the late Rep. Mel Price's term.
   Jones, who appeared in ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' overpowered two
other Democrats to win a shot against embattled Rep. Pat Swindall
for his 4th district seat in the Atlanta area.
   Georgia Democrats also picked a 29-year-old lawyer, David
Worley, to run against Rep. Newt Gingrich, the other Republican
among the state's 10 congressmen. Gingrich, a five-term lawmaker
unopposed for his party's nomination, has been a leader in efforts
to force an investigation of House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Colorado also had primaries in six congressional districts, but
only one hot battle. Republican State Rep. David Bath defeated
former Secretary of State Mary Estill Buchanan, who lost to Gary
Hart in the 1980 Senate race, 55 percent to 45 percent in
incomplete returns. The winner will face 2nd district incumbent
David Skaggs, a Democrat, in the fall.
   In the special election to fill the remaining 4{ months of
Price's term, Democrat Jerry Costello defeated Republican Robert
Gaffner. The two also are running against each other in November
for a full term from the 21st district.
   Unofficial returns from all 469 precincts showed Costello with
33,247 votes, or 51.5 percent, to Gaffner's 31,279, or 48.5 percent.
   The two won their party's nominations in the March primary after
Price, a Democrat who held the seat for nearly 44 years, announced
he was retiring at the end of his term. Price, however, died April
22 at 83, and both men filed for the special election.
   Gaffner, 55, an administrator at St. Louis Community College,
came within 943 votes of defeating Price in 1986.
   This year, he waged a slashing campaign accusing Costello of
political bossism and trying to link him to allegations of judicial
corruption in St. Clair County.
   Costello, 38, is the St. Clair County board chairman and one of
the most powerful Democratic Party leaders in the region.
   Costello's campaign has accused Gaffner of smear tactics,
claimed that he lacks experience in government and criticized his
use of national GOP campaign funds and ``Republican media hit men
who slink in from the East Coast.''
   In Georgia, Swindall is considered vulnerable because of his
admission that he considered using laundered drug money to finance
the $1 million-plus home he built in an Atlanta suburb.
   Jones, who played the rustic mechanic ``Cooter'' on the
``Dukes,'' took 47 percent of the vote against Swindall two years
ago. His rivals for the Democratic nomination were lawyer Nick
Moraitakis and John Stembler, a theater operator.
   Unofficial returns from 205 of 220 precincts showed Jones with
30,694 votes, or 63 percent; Moraitakis, 10,061, or 21 percent; and
Stembler, 8,027, or 16 percent.
   In the 6th District race to oppose Gingrich, unofficial returns
from 150 of 218 precincts showed Worley with 20,696 votes, or 54
percent to businessman Clyde Owens' 17,400, or 46 percent. Worley
had the backing of Georgia House Speaker Tom Murphy.
   In Colorado's 3rd District, which spans much of the western and
southern part of the state, two Republicans, former Montrose County
Assessor Jim Zartman and Montrose County Commissioner Ken Neesham,
were on the ballot, but Neesham was forced to suspend his campaign
because of strong GOP opposition. He is embroiled in a criminal
investigation of alleged illegal use of county road equipment.
Democratic incumbent Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell was unopposed in
the primary.

   Film critics gave a lukewarm
reception Tuesday to ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' a new
interpretation of the life of Jesus that has been denounced,
unseen, by some Christians and has raised counter-charges that some
of the criticism is anti-Semitic.
   The film, which opens to the public Friday, depicts Jesus as a
troubled, guilt-ridden man uncertain of his destiny and tempted to
resist what Christians believe is his divinity.
   The 2{-hour movie describes Jesus' career leading to the
crucifixion. Then, during his agony on the cross, he sees a little
girl. She says she's his guardian angel sent by God, who doesn't
want him to die in pain.
   She removes him from the cross and takes him to Mary Magdalene,
who tends his wounds. He lives out his life as a man, first
marrying Mary Magdalene and then another woman after her death.
   As an old man dying, his disciples come to him. Judas reveals
the angel to be Satan, calls Jesus a weakling and tells him that
God wanted him to die on the cross and that he should do as God
intended. The last scene is Jesus' smiling death on the cross.
   The movie carries an R rating, but less for sex than for gore,
although there are shots of bodies naked from the waist up in river
scenes with John the Baptist, Mary Magdalene plying her trade as a
prostitute, and the scene that has most outraged theological
opponents, Jesus having sex with Mary Magdalene.
   At the start of the movie is a notice saying that it was based
on Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis' 1955 novel ``The Last Temptation
of Christ,'' and not on the Gospels.
   Film critics who viewed the movie in a Universal Studios
screening room, including Michael Medved of ``Sneak Previews,''
Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times, and Bob Thomas of The
Associated Press, said they were unimpressed overall.
   ``An intellectual exercise of the ``What if?'' variety,'' Thomas
said. ``At times moving, often overwrought, and at least 40 minutes
too long.''
   ``It's the height of irony that this level of controversy could
be generated by a movie this awful,'' said Medved. ``I can
understand why the religious groups would be offended, as would the
public by this boredom.''
   Protestant fundamentalists, notably the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a
United Methodist minister who heads the American Family Association
in Tupelo, Miss., and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, have been campaigning
against the movie. Their protests have escalated since Universal
Pictures rejected pleas to destroy the film or sell it to them for
destruction.
   Universal responded by accusing protesters of censorship and
moving up the release date from Sept. 23 to Friday.
   As the critics watched Tuesday, 150 Christian protesters, none
of whom had seen the film, rallied on another part of the massive
studio lot to castigate Universal and its parent company, MCA
Inc.They held a mock crucifixion with a bloodied Jesus screaming in
agony as a man portraying MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman nailed him to
a 10-foot cross.
   Wasserman, encountered later as he walked to the MCA commissary,
would not acknowledge a reporter's questions about the film and
controversy.
   Critics of the protesters have accused some of verging into
anti-Jewish attacks. Other Christian ministers denounced an earlier
march led by the Rev. R.L. Hymers, pastor of Fundamentalist Baptist
Tabernacle, at a synagogue where he thought Wasserman worshiped.
   There was no demonstration outside a New York screening.
   The U.S. Catholic Conference said Tuesday that it is urging the
nation's 53 million Catholics not to see the film. Spokesman
Richard Hirsch called it a ``B-grade, muddleheaded movie.''
   However, the conference said that although the film is ``clearly
contrary to the teachings of the church,'' public protests would
give it more publicity.
   Members of other churches, such as the Episcopal bishop of New
York, said after a preview they would not oppose the film's release.
   The $6.5 million movie was directed by Martin Scorsese (``Taxi
Driver'' and ``Raging Bull'') and stars Willem Dafoe (``Platoon'')
as Jesus, Barbara Hershey (``Hannah and Her Sisters'') as Mary
Magdalene, and rocker David Bowie as Pontius Pilate.
   ``I am not surprised at people being shocked by the idea of
it,'' Scorsese said Tuesday night in an appearance on ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' program.
   ``I think there are people out there who want to see it and want
to have this spiritual experience, I believe a moving experience,''
Scorsese said.
   Wildmon and Falwell complained that they were turned away by
Universal from screenings Tuesday in New York and Los Angeles.
   Wildmon was refused ``because you have chosen to speak out
against MCA Inc. and Universal Pictures with regard to the film
without seeing it, and because you rejected our earlier offer to
see the film on July 12,'' said a letter from Universal.
   The studio noted Falwell's criticism in withdrawing its
invitation to him, said Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss. The former
Moral Majority leader has joined other ministers in calling for a
boycott of MCA, Universal's parent corporation, and its
subsidiaries.
   ``We just thought they would have respected the rights of
millions and millions of Christians who objected to the film. But
obviously all they think about is money,'' said Larry Poland, a
Christian media consultant who helped advise Universal on the film
before withdrawing in protest after a bootleg script was circulated.

   A 10-year-old girl with plans to change
the world and an idea of how to do it sent President Reagan a poem
and pictures, and says she got back a letter of encouragement.
   But Nicole ``Nikki'' Lawrence says she still likes Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis for the top job _ until she's
old enough for it, that is.
   The Bluefield resident said she sent her July letter to Reagan
with drawings of national monuments, the president and his wife in
order to learn more about the job she wants to hold.
   ``Your letter reinforces my confidence that the United States
will remain strong, competitive, and free through the decades to
come, and may God bless you,'' Reagan wrote back, according to the
Bluefield Daily Telegraph.
   Nikki says she's wanted to be president since she was 3 years
old, and her platform is ready.
   ``You won't be paying so much taxes,'' she said. ``You're only
going to pay 10 cents a day in taxes.
   ``I have ways to stop water pollution, any other pollution. I'll
make a law against hair spray and spray-on deodorant to protect the
ozone layer.''
   In disarmament issues, Nikki said she would send every nuclear
warhead to Mars.
   Her 4-year-old brother, Michael, would be ``in charge of arms,''
while her father would be vice president and her mother would be
treasurer, she said.
   For now, however, Nikki says her vote goes to Dukakis, if only
he would improve his looks.
   ``He'd do better if he got Elvis sideburns,'' Nikki said. ``I
saw this show on Nickelodeon about Lincoln and his beard. They
showed how Dukakis would look if he got Elvis sideburns.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy Innis, the national chairman of the Congress
of Racial Equality, shoved the Rev. Al Sharpton to the ground
during the taping of a nationally syndicated television program
Tuesday.
   The two men managed to regain their composure and continue the
discussion of leadership in the black community, said Bill Boggs,
executive producer of the Morton Downey Jr. show.
   But Sharpton said they will have it out in a benefit boxing
match next month, Boggs said.
   The incident occurred during taping of the often heated talk
show at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem.
   During earlier taping Monday night, ``Al Sharpton started to
make some derogatory remarks about Roy Innis,'' Boggs said. Downey
then arranged for the two men to come face-to-face the next night.
   During taping Tuesday, ``Sharpton made a few statements early in
the show that basically questioned Innis' ability and his authority
as a black leader today and for whom he was speaking, and
criticized him for `kowtowing' to (state Attorney General) Robert
Abrams,'' Boggs said.
   Abrams is the special prosecutor in the case of Tawana Brawley,
a black Dutchess County teen-ager who claims she was abducted and
sexually assaulted by a group of white men. Under the guidance of
her advisers, who include Sharpton, Miss Brawley has refused to
cooperate with the investigation.
   Innis cited his own appearance on a Downey show in June.
According to Boggs, Innis told Sharpton that during that show, he
had come to Sharpton's defense, ``in spite of all those
shenanigans'' in the case.
   A screaming match ensued, with Sharpton yelling ``that's not
true.''
   ``Innis stood up and was basically telling Sharpton to let him
speak ... and towered over him,'' the producer said. As the rotund
Sharpton started to get up, Innis pushed him. Sharpton fell into
the chair and toppled over backwards onto the floor.
   Sharpton was not hurt, but he leapt up and a lot of people
rushed onto the stage, Boggs said.
   Downey brought things back under control within about 20 minutes
and there was no other physical confrontation, he said.
   Boggs said the show is scheduled to air Aug. 30.

   The House has passed a compromise spending
bill providing $59 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and 16 independent agencies.
   The House vote Tuesday was 373-30, sending the bill to the
Senate.
   House Democratic leaders said the appropriations bill for HUD
and other agencies is consistent with the budget summit agreement
worked out last year by Congress and the White House.
   The bill would provide $10.7 billion for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, including $900 million for a
space station, and funds for the Environmental Protection Agency,
the Veterans Administration, the National Science Foundation and
the Consumer Product Safety Commission, among other agencies.

   A Philadelphia law firm has paid $50 million
in the largest payment ever to settle a claim by the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   The FSLIC, the government insurance fund backing deposits in
savings institutions, announced Tuesday it had received the payment
from the firm of Blank, Rome, Comisky & McCauley to settle charges
stemming from the firm's representation of Sunrise Savings and Loan
Association of Boynton Beach, Fla.
   FSLIC, in a suit seeking $250 million, charged the law firm with
negligently advising Sunrise and aiding its officers in violating
federal banking laws.
   Proceeds of the settlement will be divided between FSLIC and
former shareholders of Sunrise, an insolvent institution placed
into receivership in July 1985, according to a statement from the
agency.

<HEAD>Leftist Replacing Archconservative As President</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEAD prospects uncertain. Inauguration set for 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>

<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist law professor Rodrigo Borja, who
today replaces an archconservative as Ecuador's president, has
pledged renewed ties with Nicaragua and an end to the nation's free
market economy.
   Borja, leader of the Democratic Left Party, succeeds Leon Febres
Cordero, a bitter political rival and President Reagan's closest
ally in South America.
   A champion of free enterprise during his four-year term, Febres
Cordero was barred from re-election by the constitution.
   Borja, who describes himself as a leftist but not a Marxist,
defeated populist candidate Abdala Bucaram in a runoff May 8.
   Presidents Fidel Castro of Cuba and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
were among foreign leaders who came to Ecuador for today's
inauguration, and Castro took a swipe at the United States in his
arrival statement Tuesday.
   In a brief speech at the Quito airport, he praised the good
relations he said exist between his communist country and Ecuador.
   ``They are a proof of independence in the face of those who
would like to see us not so united,'' Castro said in an obvious
reference to the United States.
   Castro rarely travels abroad, and his visit was seen as a sign
of strong support for the Borja government.
   Borja has criticized Ecuador's pro-American foreign policy and
said he would seek close ties to the non-aligned movement.
   Nevertheless, U.S. officials say they expect to be able to work
with Borja and note that friends and foes consider him a highly
intelligent and honest political leader.
   ``Borja may prove to be a problem for the U.S. at times, but he
is no threat to democracy in Ecuador,'' said one U.S. official, who
spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz was to represent the United
States at the inauguration.
   This Colorado-size nation of 10 million on the northwestern
shoulder of South America returned to democracy in 1979 after nine
years of civilian and military dictatorships.
   Borja said one of his first official acts after being sworn in
would be to renew diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, where the
leftist government has been fighting U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Ties were broken in October 1985 after Febres Cordero accused
Ortega of insulting him by calling him a pawn of U.S. foreign
policy.
   Borja, 53, is a long-time political foe of Febres Cordero, 57,
and lost a bitterly fought runoff to him in 1984. He vowed to
dismantle Febres Cordero's free-market economic program, which he
blames for the country's bleak economic situation.
   The economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 1987. Annual inflation is
running at nearly 60 percent, and less than half the work force is
employed full-time.
   No payments have been made since January on Ecuador's $9.2
billion foreign debt. The nation is now more than a billion dollars
in arrears.
   The Febres Cordero government blamed the economic slide on the
collapse of world oil prices and devastating earthquakes that
crippled Ecuador's oil industry for nearly six months in 1987.
   Borja said he will respect private enterprise, but announced he
will impose exchange controls, restrict imports to save scarce
dollar reserves and regulate prices of basic consumer goods to
fight inflation.
   He has also announced plans for a more restrictive foreign
investment policy and a moratorium on foreign debt payments if
creditors do not agree to negotiate easier terms.
   ``In the present situation of an economic crisis, payment of the
foreign debt is simply not possible,'' he said recently.
   The bitter rivalry between Borja and Febres Cordero flared in
recent weeks, creating problems in the transition of power. Febres
Cordero announced he would boycott the inauguration and not hand
over the presidential sash to his successor.
   Borja accused Febres Cordero of trying to sabotage the new
government by creating economic problems for him before he took
office. He charged that the outgoing government deliberately fueled
inflation by running up a budget deficit of 11 percent.
   Interior Minister Heinz Moeller in turn accused Borja and his
associates of needless ``whining'' and said they should instead
dedicate their time to publicizing the details of their economic
program to ease fears among business leaders.

<HEAD>Southerners Lead in Alcohol Consumption, Study Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southerners drank more alcoholic beverages
than residents of any other U.S. region last year, and households
with incomes above $35,000 drank more than any other income group,
a study found.
   The study, released Tuesday by the alcoholic beverage research
publication Impact, was based on diaries kept by 12,000 people
during 1987. The survey, compiled by NFO Research Inc. of Toledo,
Ohio, covered beverage consumption by location, time of day, sex,
age, geographic region and household income.
   The South, when considered as one of four U.S. regions, drank
the most alcoholic beverages _ 32.3 percent of all consumed _
followed by the Northeast at 24.8 percent, the North Central region
at 24.1 percent and the West at 18.8 percent. But the West led the
nation in wine consumption, at 31.3 percent of all wine drunk.
   Southerners drank 39.2 percent of all wine coolers and 33.8
percent of beer, leading in those categories. Consumption of
distilled spirits, or hard liquor, was almost evenly divided among
the four regions.
   Households with incomes of $35,000 and above drank the most of
every type of alcoholic beverage, 35.2 percent. People in that
category consumed 42.7 percent of all distilled spirits, twice the
level of the $15,000-$24,000 group.
   The next-highest group in overall alcohol consumption were
households with incomes under $15,000, accounting for 22.7 percent
of all alcohol consumed. Households with incomes from $15,000 to
$24,000 consumed 18.5 percent, the $25,000 to $29,000 group
consumed 12.7 percent and the $30,000 to $34,000 group drank 10.9
percent.
   In the under-$24,000 groups, beer and wine coolers were the
favorite beverages, at 42.7 percent and 37.6 percent, respectively.
The $25,000-to-$29,000 households drank the least wine and spirits,
11 percent and 10 percent respectively.
   Men consumed 75.2 percent of all alcohol last year. Men drank
81.8 percent of all beer, 59.3 percent of hard liquor and 47.4
percent of wine, while females drank 61.7 percent of coolers and
52.6 percent of wine.
   Drinkers under 20 years old accounted for only 0.5 percent of
all alcohol consumed. The report noted that every state has adopted
the 21-year-old minimum drinking age.
   The 30-to-39-year-old age group consumed 46.2 percent of all
coolers, 34 percent of beer and 29.7 percent of wine, while in the
over-60 age group distilled spirits were the favorite. The older
folks least favored beer and coolers.
   The study found 34.7 percent of hard liquor and 32.5 percent of
beer was consumed away from home, while 81.7 percent of wine
coolers and 76.9 percent of wine was drunk at home.
   Most consumption of alcoholic drinks occurred toward the later
part of the day, though 2.3 percent of alcohol was consumed at
breakfast.

   Two Secret Service says two of its agents in the
detail guarding Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
lost revolvers and Secret Service identification pins when their
Boston hotel rooms were ransacked.
   Richard W. Terry, special agent in charge of the Boston office,
said the Secret Service and Boston police were trying to recover
the equipment, which was stolen Sunday.
   ``We do have some leads, and we're hopeful something will turn
up,'' Terry said.
   Investigators are treating the burglaries as ``random
break-ins'' but haven't ruled out the possibility that someone
intended to steal Secret Service equipment, Terry said.
   He said the theft doesn't affect the agency's ability to protect
the Massachusetts governor as he campaigns for the presidency.

<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts mother of a disabled child
says she told George Bush his proposed federal program for child
care is ``certainly a good beginning,'' but said she had some
questions as well.
   The vice president called Kathleen Mulligan, mother of a
2-year-old with Down's Syndrome, on Tuesday.
   The woman has worked for change in federal aid programs since
December 1986, when she was told her daughter was ineligible for
Supplemental Security Income payments while either the child or the
child's father lived at home care. Kenneth Mulligan earned more
than the $22,800 income cap at the time.
   ``My direct quote to the vice president was that this program is
certainly a good beginning,'' Mrs. Mulligan, 36, said of the phone
call.
   But Mrs. Mulligan said she remains wary because she has yet to
learn how the program will work. ``I asked for the cap to be lifted
so that it could affect all people nationwide,'' she said.
   She said she asked him a number of questions about how the
program would work. ``He said that when he returned to Washington
he would relay those questions to the proper people,'' she said.''

   The best bet for the No. 2 spot on the
Republican ticket is a Westerner or Midwesterner and almost
certainly not a woman, George Bush's Iowa campaign manager predicts.
   And he said pairing Bush with former Republican presidential
rival Bob Dole would be the strongest ticket for Iowa.
   ``I think Bob Dole could probably do more to help the ticket in
Iowa than any other prospective vice presidential candidate,'' said
George Wittgraf. ``I think there's a good chance the ticket will
include a Midwesterner or a Westerner.''
   In any case, Wittgraf predicted, the second spot won't go to a
woman, because that would be viewed by voters as ``tokenism'' that
would hurt certain GOP nominee Bush.
   ``It would be viewed first as putting a woman on the ticket,''
Wittgraf said. ``Many people would view that as political tokenism.
She wouldn't be judged on her merits, she would be judged as a
woman.''

<HEAD>Stay Granted As State Board Takes Control Of Defiant Yonkers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A divided appeals panel granted Yonkers a
temporary reprieve from bankrupting fines hours after a state board
took control of the city's finances in a dispute over housing
desegregation.
   ``I knew we could find sanity outside (Judge Leonard) Sand's
courtroom,'' said City Council Minority Leader Nicholas Longo, who
was found in contempt by the U.S. District judge for refusing to
endorse Sand's housing desegregation plan.
   Three other councilmen and the city also were declared in
contempt and subjected to fines since the Aug. 2 council vote that
defied the desegregation order.
   The one-week stay granted Tuesday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals staved off layoffs due to the city's $100-a-day fine,
which has been doubled daily. City officials had predicted layoffs
would begin as early as next Tuesday.
   For Longo and the three other councilmen, the stay halted their
$500-a-day personal fines, which did not double, and removed Sand's
threat of imprisonment he made had their contempt continued through
today.
   The appellate panel split 2-1 on whether to grant the request to
stay the fines. The majority decision said the city and council
members ``barely satisfied the standards for a stay pending
appeal.'' The judges set arguments before the full appeals panel
for Aug. 17.
   Earlier, the Yonkers Emergency Financial Control Board, created
in 1984 when the state bailed out Yonkers from imminent bankruptcy,
agreed to assume the fiscal powers of the City Council and raised
the spectre of criminal charges against the defiant councilmen.
   ``In short, our goal is to save Yonkers from itself,'' said New
York Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, who heads the emergency board.
   The board has sweeping powers to control spending in New York's
fourth-largest city. But it cannot enact the zoning changes that
would allow Sand's housing plan to go forward.
   The board voted 5-1 to impose a wage and hiring freeze, and made
council members subject to misdemeanor charges if they refuse to
abide by board rules. Those rules forbid city officials from
incurring debts the city cannot pay. The target of the vote is the
four council members who voted against the desegregation resolution.
   In 1985, Sand found the city liable for intentionally
segregating its schools and housing over a 40-year period. The
council reached a settlement with the judge in January, but a
public uproar followed and officials recanted.
   Last week, the council voted 4-3 against a resolution endorsing
construction of 800 units of middle-income housing throughout the
city of 194,000 people by private developers. The judge
specifically asked them to endorse it, and the measure also
contained zoning changes and a package of financial incentives.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko, who canceled a last-ditch council
meeting he had called for tonight after the stay was granted, said
he did not think the emergency board's actions would have the
desired effect. ``The only thing that will make any difference is
the threat of removal'' of the dissident council members from
office, he said.
   Only Gov. Mario Cuomo can remove an elected official, and he has
said he does not want to get involved until the legal process is
completed.
   Lawyers for the defiant councilmen argued that Sand exceeded his
authority by ordering the City Council to pass legislation for the
housing plan.
   ``There are limits to a federal court's authority even to remedy
an unconstitutional action,'' said James D. Harmon, attorney for
Councilman Peter Chema.
   But Michael Sussman, attorney for the National Assocation for
the Advancement of Colored People, said the appeals court had a
duty to uphold Sand.
   ``The dignity of the federal court is under assault,'' said
Sussman, ``by a group of citizens who think they're above the law.''

   Kurdish separatists are fighting a
last-ditch battle with Iraqi troops, who are using poison gas to
drive them from their mountain stronghold in northeastern Iraq, a
Kurdish leader said.
   The Kurdish Democratic Party leader, Massoud Barzani, said
Tuesday that the Iraqi offensive began July 30. He said about
30,000 Iraqis were involved and have been backed by chemical
weapons, air raids and heavy artillery fire.
   The statement, received in Nicosia from an Athens office of the
party, appealed to the United Nations and the world to stop the
Iraqis, ``particularly now that the Kurdish people are the target
of gas attacks and face planned extermination.''
   It said the Iraqi move was aimed at driving out the Kurds before
a U.N. force assigned to monitor an Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war arrives. ``Our guerrillas are putting up stiff
resistance and have succeeded in preventing Iraqis from achieving
their main object of dislodging our fighters and arriving at
international frontiers before the cease-fire is officially
declared,'' the Kurds' statement said.
   Throughout the 8-year war, Iran has supported the autonomy
movement of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds and has sent arms and supplies
across the border to them. Iran and Turkey also have large Kurdish
populations.
   The statement said the Kurdish guerrillas are holding out in
Erbil province in the triangle of northeastern Iraq that is
bordered by Turkey and Iran.
   According to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, two
villages near the town of Shirwan, in the Turkish border region,
have been evacuated because of chemical attacks.
   The Kurds' statement said 63 civilians were seriously injured in
the latest gas attack. It said Kurdish refugees were fleeing to
Turkey and Iran.
   Iran has given sanctuary to the Kurds' leaders, including
Massoud Barzani, son of the legendary Kurdish resistance leader,
the late Mullah Mustafa Barzani.
   The Iranian news agency quoted a Kurdish leader as saying the
Kurds would hold out as long as possible but ``would bring major
parts of their forces to Iran because of the Iraq army's threats.''
   The Kurdish statement said 1,000 Iraqi soldiers had been killed
in the fighting. The Iranian news agency said Iraq had deployed 12
brigades and 18 light battalions against the Kurds, a total of
15,000 men.
   About 20 million Kurds are spread across an area covering parts
of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Syria.
   Iraqi Kurds have been fighting for autonomy for more than 50
years.

   A Polish folk dancer who had performed in
Israel left a farewell letter for his troupe and defected a few
hours before he was to fly home, Israeli officials said.
   The dancer belonged to a 46-member troupe performing at the
Haifa Folklore Festival. Haifa municipal spokesman Josef Bar
identified him as Sigmund Arnas.
   ``Arnas left a letter in which he said he decided to stay in
Israel and sent warmest regards to the group,'' Bar said Tuesday.
``Since this morning, we have been unable to find him. He simply
disappeared.''
   The troupe flew back to Warsaw later Tuesday after a two-week
stay in Israel. It was one of three East European folklore troupes
performing at the festival.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Israel has no set policy on
whether to grant asylum to defectors. Each case was examined on its
own merits, he said.
   Israel and Poland restored low-level diplomatic ties in 1986
after a rupture of almost 20 years.

<TEXT>
   The controversial movie, ``The Last Temptation
of Christ,'' sees Jesus' longing for a woman and family as the
biggest threat to his calling, but that isn't the way Scripture
tells it.
   He was tempted, and tempted hard, by some of the most distorting
urges of human history _ the lures of power, wealth and glory on
the threshhold of his ministry, as portrayed in Luke 4.
   The movie, previewed Tuesday, offers an altered representation
of this episode, adding female enticement to it as a main snare,
yet also retaining the tug to worldly power. Jesus is jolted loose
from both.
   The movie, which opens in some theaters Friday, has stirred a
storm of protests and condemnations by some Christians.
   Most of them hadn't seen it. Certain lewd dialogue they reported
wasn't there, although there was much blood and violence, common in
Rome-ruled Judea.
   Some Christian leaders who have seen the movie, while
criticizing elements of it, cite valid aspects, particularly in
trying to explore tensions between Jesus' conceived humanity and
Godhood.
   He is regarded both fully God and fully man, ``one who in every
respect has been tempted as we are,'' Scripture says, ``yet without
sin.''
   In the movie, he is depicted as an anxious, uncertain and
wavering individual, hardly the strong, yet tender and compelling
Jesus of Scripture. Yet, in the movie, he realizes his special role
from the start.
   ``One morning he (God) brushed over me like a cool breeze and
said, `Stand up,''' Jesus relates as he undertakes the movie
version of his ministry. But he is continually beset with
hesitations and fear.
   Fear was not unknown to the Scriptural Jesus, although specified
only on that last night before his arrest and crucifixion, when he
prayed to be freed of the ordeal, yet submitted to it.
   This also occurs in imagined fashion in the movie, which brings
cinematic suppositions to many biblical episodes _ ejection from
Nazareth, healing of a blind man, raising of Lazarus, saving of a
loose woman from stoning, storming of the temple, Peter's denial.
   The movie is explicitly fiction, based on a novel by Greek
author Nikos Kazanzakis, and not bound to the Scriptural record.
That record sometimes offers possible hints to the movie's
elaborations.
   Some twists, however, were sheer conjecture, such as theorizing
that in Jesus' early days as a carpenter he made crosses for Roman
executions, and that he later purposely arranged with Judas to
betray him.
   Also entirely contrived was a lengthy dream sequence in which
Jesus, while dying on the cross, envisions himself leaving the
cross while under the persuasion of an ``angel,'' and living
naturally as he often had wanted to do.
   He is shown having sexual relations with Mary Magdalene, for
whom he had suppressed his yearnings. In the dream, she dies and
then he is married to Mary, the sister of the Scriptural Martha,
and has children.
   As an old man, his apostles confront him, upbraiding him for not
being crucified and resurrected as he promised _ for not being
``the door,'' bringing God and man together, for not being a
sacrfice.
   He realizes then that the ``angel'' that had called him off the
cross was actually Satan. Jesus crawls back toward reality, saying,
``I want to pay the price. I want salvation. I want to be crucified
and rise again.''
   Back in torture on the cross, he smiles and shouts at the end,
``It is accomplished!''
   The movie contains some nudity, including women in the crowd to
which John the Baptist was preaching, but it isn't erotic. However,
the concentration on Mary Magdalene as Jesus' potential pitfall
diverges from the gospel.
   Jesus liked women, Scripture makes clear, visited with them,
conversed with them in public contrary to custom, and had women
among his followers, which was most unconventional for a
first-century rabbi.
   In fact, women supported his ministry, as brought out in Luke
8:3, and only women friends stayed with him to the end, while the
apostles hid in fear.
   But to regard natural sexuality as evil is contrary to the
biblical world, and to imply that the presence of that drive in
Jesus was wrong reflects an ancient Christian heresy, ``Docetism,''
which dehumanized Jesus, considering his body only a phantom.
   Kazanzakis, apparently influenced by such thinking, seemed to
regard physical instincts in Jesus as contrary to Godliness.

   A new type of genetically engineered AIDS drug
is being tested starting today on human victims of the deadly
disease at the National Cancer Institute.
   The first round of tests is designed to assess the safety of the
drug, called CD4, rather than its effectiveness, but researchers
hope the drug will open new avenues to attack the virus that causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The drug mimics a protein normally found on the surface of
immune system cells that are susceptible to the AIDS virus.
   Researchers hope the experimental drug will, in effect, fool the
deadly virus into harmlessly attaching itself to the injected
substance rather than the similar receptors on immune system cells.
   Similar studies will begin in a few days at San Francisco
General Hospital and New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.
   About 50 patients will be involved in the first round of tests
of the drug which is manufactured by Genentech Inc. of South San
Francisco, Calif.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact
with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. Its
chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.
   As of Monday, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,208 Americans, of
whom more than half, 39,620, had died, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to have recovered from
AIDS.

<HEAD>CIA Director Accuses Soviets of Stepping Up Espionage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   CIA director William H. Webster says the Soviets
are trying harder than ever to tap into U.S. intelligence and that
security breaches in the last three years have cost the United
States billions of dollars.
   In a speech Tuesday to the American Bar Association, he said he
has set up a special counter-intelligence agency to protect the
CIA's foreign operations.
   ``This center was badly needed ... too many things were falling
between chairs,'' he told the association's annual meeting. About
12,000 lawyers are attending the weeklong convention, which ends
today.
   ``Over the past three years, we have discovered more
penetrations of the U.S. defense and intelligence communities than
at any time in our history,'' said Webster, who took over the
Central Intelligence Agency in May 1987 after 10 years as director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
   ``The costs of these compromises are estimated in the billions
of dollars,'' he added.
   ``The Soviet intelligence services, the KGB and GRU, represent
by far the most significant intelligence threat ... Despite Soviet
glasnost and perestroika, we've actually seen an increase this year
in Soviet atempts to recruit U.S. sources,'' he said.
   Glasnost is the name of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
drive for greater discussion on selected subjects. Perestroika is
his program to make Soviet economy more efficient.
   Webster, a former U.S. Court of Appeals judge, said the Soviets
were ``more aggressive and more sophisticated'' than ever in their
search for information on U.S. nuclear strategic forces, foreign
policy, NATO, technology, American intelligence sources and
methods, and congressional intentions.
   He cited two cases this summer, both involving Canada: the
arrest of Canadian Stephen Ratkai on charges of trying to pass U.S.
military secrets to the Soviet Union in Newfoundland, and the
expulsion or barring from Canada of 17 Soviet officials for
allegedly attempting to steal U.S. military and commercial
technology in Montreal.
   Webster said the CIA and FBI were working closely together in
``offensive and defensive measures'' to counter foreign spies.
   He said the CIA collected information on 253 terrorist threats
around the world over the past 3{ years, and he cited one success
and one failure when warnings were relayed into the field.
   ``In one such case, the agency received a report that terrorists
planned to assassinate the senior American diplomat in a major
Eastern country when he arrived for a meeting ... He arranged for
the meeting to be held elsewhere and escaped the attempt on his
life.
   ``Sadly, just a few days ago, a similar warning was issued to
another figure in South America. The warning was not heeded and he
was assassinated.''
   CIA public affairs director William Baker said the director
intentionally did not name the two people involved and that the
agency would not comment further.
   Webster said terrorism was again on the increase, from 500
incidents in 1981 to almost 800 in 1985 and a projected 900 this
year.
   ``About half of these terrorist incidents worldwide are directed
against U.S. persons and property,'' he said.
   However, he credited FBI intelligence-gathering with checking
terrorist bombings and other attacks within the United States, down
from 100 a year to ``less than a dozen in the last two years.''

   Amnesty International today accused India of
covering up alleged human rights abuses by its security forces and
said there are credible reports that Indian police have murdered
scores of religious minorities.
   The Indian government accused the international human rights
organization of biased and distorted reporting.
   In a 26-page report on India, Amnesty International said it
heard of dozens of prisoners being tortured and dying in police
custody. The London-based organization also said an investigation
into an alleged police massacre of 80 Moslem villagers had been
kept secret.
   Amnesty cited an ``official failure to clamp down on lawlessness
by India's national and state security forces''and called on the
government of the world's largest democracy to investigate.
   ``Many victims were involved in violence themselves and have
killed civilians and security personnel, notably in Punjab,''
Amnesty said in a statement accompanying the review, which covered
the past 18 months. ``But action taken against them has
transgressed international human rights standards.''
   The group said the report was sent to Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi in June, but that Gandhi did not reply.
   The report says most of the alleged victims were political
activists or members of poor, underprivileged groups.
   It says Amnesty was told by a Punjab civil rights group, which
it did not identify, that security forces killed more than 70 Sikhs
in fake or staged encounters between May 12 and Aug. 22 last year
in the northern state's Amritsar district.
   Sikhs, a religious minority in India, are fighting for a
separate homeland in Punjab, where they have slight majority. They
claim discrimination by the majority Hindus.
   Amnesty said the group claimed another 50 Sikhs were killed in
similar encounters in Punjab's Faridkot district between May 12 and
July 29 of last year.
   ``There certainly has been too great a pattern of `encounter'
killings over the years for it to be dismissed as the odd, isolated
case,'' said Amnesty International spokesman Sean Stiles.
   Similar killings by military and police forces have been
reported in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur states, with security
forces having shoot-on-sight powers granted in 1986, the report
said.
   ``They (the reports of killings) have gained in credibility
through circumstantial evidence,'' the report said.
   On the alleged massacre of 80 Moslems, Amnesty said a civil
rights group claimed to have detailed evidence that police carried
out the killings, including of children as young as 3, during
Hindu-Moslem clashes in Uttar Pradesh in May 1987.
   The report said witnesses testified that security forces dumped
bodies in rivers and canals or burned them.
   Authorities in Uttar Pradesh, where Moslems are a 15 percent
minority, have denied there was a police massacre.
   In New Dehli, a foreign ministry official said Amnesty
International ``presents happenings in the country in a very
one-sided and distorted manner.''
   The official was not identified under briefing rules. He said
the report ``tended to highlight stray incidents of human rights
violations, but minimized the numerous rights and freedoms enjoyed
by Indians.
   ``Wherever charges were proved, exemplary action was taken
against the guilty,'' he added.

   A major earthquake shook the vicinity
of the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today, seismologists
said. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury.
   The quake, which registered 7.3 on the Richter scale, was
centered 60 miles east of Guadalcanal, said the Bureau of Mineral
Resources.
   The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu reported no
threat of a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami, or tidal wave, but
said some areas could experience small sea level changes.
   Mineral Resources spokesman Trevor Jones said the quake hit at
2:38 p.m. (12:38 a.m. EDT). In Tokyo, Japan's Central
Meteorological Agency recorded the quake slightly later.
   The Solomons, a double chain of six large islands and many
smaller ones, is 1,000 miles east of Port Moresby, Papua New
Guinea, and 1,600 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia.
   The islands have a mainly Melanesian population of about
160,000. The capital, Honiara, was built near the famed Guadalcanal
battleground of World War II and has about 20,000 residents.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An quake of 5 on the scale is considered ``very strong'' and a 6
``severe,'' capable of widespread damage near the epicenter.
   A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread
heavy damage.
   Every increase of one digit represents a tenfold increase in
magnitude, thus a reading of 7.5 would be 10 times stronger than
one of 6.5.

   A federal judge accused by a higher
court of being ``hardened against the government'' in favor of the
Ku Klux Klan has set a hearing to determine his own fitness for
trial in U.S. government cases.
   No one from the Justice Department plans to be at the hearing
scheduled for Friday by U.S. District Judge William M. Acker Jr.
But an attorney for Klansmen said he'll be there to state that
Acker has been ``good and fair.''
   Acker, a 60-year-old Yale Law School graduate appointed to the
bench by President Reagan in 1982, delivered rulings against the
Justice Department in litigation involving the Klan that prompted
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to remove him from the case.
   ``During the course of this litigation,'' wrote Circuit Judge
Frank M. Johnson of Montgomery, ``Judge Acker's position has become
hardened against the government, and he has evidenced a commitment
that clearly reflects that he is no longer able to view these cases
impartially.''
   Acker had ruled that the actions of several Klansmen accused of
violating the rights of marchers in a violent confrontation at
Decatur in 1979 did not justify what Acker said were improper
tactics used by the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
which Acker branded ``a counter-vigilante group.''
   The center had sued the Klansmen, then gave their testimony in
that case to the Justice Department, which used it to obtain
indictments against the Klansmen. Acker ruled the testimony
inadmissible and then did not follow 11th Circuit instructions to
admit it.
   The government appealed and the 11th Circuit ruled that the
Klansmen's testimony should not be suppressed.
   The appeals court ordered Acker's removal from the case in June
when the government filed a second appeal, arguing he had failed to
follow the directions.
   Afterward, Acker scheduled the hearing on his own fitness,
saying:
   ``This court is neither seeking praise nor condemnation ... but
feels it is necessary that it create a forum for frank and serious
discussion of a very serious subject, namely: `Should a judge whose
position is hardened against the government sit on the government's
cases?'''
   The U.S. attorney for northern Alabama, Frank Donaldson, said
Tuesday that no one from the Justice Department will be at the
hearing.
   ``The United States has at this time insufficient information to
determine and no reason to believe that Judge Acker's proposed
general recusal is either necessary or appropriate,'' Donaldson
said in a legal response to the hearing.
   Donaldson said a decision to recuse Acker, or legally challenge
his competence to preside as judge, ``is better left for
consideration on a case-by-case basis.''
   Kenneth J. Gomany, one of the attorneys for the Klansmen, said
he plans to attend the show-cause proceeding ``to submit any kind
of briefs in support'' of the Acker.
   ``I think he is a good and fair judge and he's ruled against our
clients and against the government on occasion. More often than
not, he's ruled against our clients. All in all, he's been
impartial,'' said Gomany.
   Morris Dees, director of the poverty center, said his
organization would take no position on Acker's qualifications to
preside over government cases.
   ``We've never had any experience with Judge Acker in any other
case,'' Dees said. During nearly two decades, the center has
handled several highly publicized civil rights and death penalty
cases.

<TEXT>
   The hunger strike by a bedridden Cesar
Chavez headed into its 25th day today, as it matched the length of
his fast 20 years ago to gain recognition of the United Farm
Workers.
   The 61-year-old union leader has given no indication that he
plans to stop his water-only fast for union contracts and a boycott
of California table grapes because of five pesticides used on them.
   Chavez's levels of uric acid remain constant but high,
threatening to cause kidney failure, and his blood pressure is
rising, union spokeswoman Lorena Parlee said Tuesday, quoting Dr.
Fidel Huerta.
   The union said Chavez has lost at least 20 pounds during the
fast, an effort to gain support for a 4-year-old boycott of
California grapes that has been virtually ignored by the public.
   On Monday, a caravan of Hollywood film and television stars
trekked to this community 200 miles north of Los Angeles to give
the boycott a publicity boost. They visited the labor leader, six
at a time, at his bedside and then issued a strong public plea to
support the table grape boycott.
   Among the celebrities were actors Martin Sheen, Eddie Albert and
Robert Blake and comedian and political activist Dick Gregory.
   But their pleas have had ``absolutely no effect on sales
whatsoever,'' said Bruce Obbink, president of the Calfornia Table
Grape Commission. State officials and growers deny that table
grapes contain dangerous pesticide residues, as the union contends.
   Chavez' United Farm Workers union has no contracts among
California table grape growers and the union has lost 30,000
dues-paying members during the last decade.
   In 1968, Chavez fasted for 25 days to gain recognition of the
union and to make a plea for nonviolence during bitter union fights.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Ban on Dumping of Sludge in Atlantic Ocean</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Medical Waste Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate vote to ban dumping sludge in the
Atlantic Ocean brings the nation ``closer to the day when we'll
stop using the ocean as a sewer,'' a key sponsor of the measure
says.
   The Senate, spurred by fears about sludge and medical waste that
has washed up recently on East Coast beaches, voted 97-0 on Tuesday
to bar the practice.
   A similar bill is awaiting action in the House.
   The Senate measure bans the dumping of municipal sludge off the
coasts of New York and New Jersey after 1991 and orders the closing
of a sludge dump site 106 miles off the New Jersey coast, the only
site where sludge can currently be legally dumped.
   The site is used by six sewage authorities in New Jersey and
three in New York, including the city of New York.
   ``We need a firm deadline, in the law, to ban the ocean dumping
of sewage sludge,'' said Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., one of the
co-sponsors. ``Only then will alternatives be put in place. Only
then will the dumping stop.''
   The Senate added an amendment by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
which bans the disposal of all medical waste in oceans or streams.
It also approved another amendment, by Lautenberg, providing a
five-year prison sentence for anyone caught violating that ban.
   ``Last week, virtually every Connecticut beach was shut down
because of medical waste during one of the hottest spells in the
state's history,'' Dodd told his colleagues.
   ``We're moving closer to the day when we'll stop using the ocean
as a sewer,'' said Lautenberg. ``Sludge dumping is a throwaway
approach to our waste problem and contributes to the overall ocean
pollution problem.''
   Congress first ordered an end to the ocean dumping of sludge in
1972. Five years later, Congress directed that the dumping be ended
by 1981. But the nine municipalities in New York and New Jersey
successfully sued in federal court to ignore that deadline.

<TEXT>
   An official human rights commission called on the
government to release Soviets jailed for violating laws limiting
religious activity and said most of the prisoners have embraced
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   At the same time, religious activists in the western Ukraine
reported a new crackdown on the banned Ukrainian Catholic Church,
which operates underground.
   In its appeal Tuesday, the Commission on International
Cooperation on Humanitarian Questions and Human Rights said: ``It
seems to us that today these people do not represent any social
danger for our society. We propose that it would be an act of great
humane meaning to forgive them.''
   No figures were available on how many prisoners might be
affected. In a report on the appeal, the official Tass news agency
said such an amnesty would affect only a few people.
   It likely would not affect most of the 200 people who religious
activists estimate were convicted under different laws and remain
jailed or exiled.
   The appeal to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet did not touch
on the strictest laws governing religious activity, which require
registration of religious groups, sharply limit religious education
and prohibit charitable activity.
   The appeal concerned those convicted under two articles of
Soviet law: one on violations of the separation of church and
state, which carries a maximum one-year sentence, and one against
directing religious activities judged to be harmful to others,
which carries a maximum five years in prison or exile.
   The commission, headed by prominent journalist Fyodor Burlatsky,
said the ``majority of believers have accepted `perestroika' and
have made a significant contribution to realizing plans for the
social-economic development of the country. All this testifies to
the new approach to government-church relations in the era of
`perestroika' and democratization of Soviet society.''
   ``Perestroika'' is the term Gorbachev uses to describe his
wide-ranging economic, political and social reform program.
   Ivan Gel, a member of a committee seeking legalization of the
Ukrainian Catholic church, said in a telephone interview from Lvov
that a police crackdown began in the western Ukraine after several
church services attracted thousands of people in July.
   ``There is without a doubt a sharp increase in pressure on the
church, and not only on the church but on the whole society,'' he
said.
   Police have broken up some religious services, prevented rural
residents from reaching other villages for services and levied
heavy fines on unauthorized services, he said.
   Because officials have refused to recognize the church, it does
not have permission to hold services.
   Authorities regard the services as violations of the law against
unauthorized gatherings and warned church groups they face a
maximum $480 fine for their first offense and up to $1,600 for a
second, Gel said.
   Gel said up to 20,000 people gathered in a village of the
Ternopol region July 17 to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of the
coming of Christianity to the Ukraine. Six days later, about 5,000
people gathered for a service devoted to the victims of Stalinism,
he said.
   Much of the western Ukraine was outside Soviet territory until
after World War II, when the nation's border expanded. The
Ukrainian Catholic Church was forcibly united with the Orthodox
Church and officially ceased to exist.
   Activists say several million believers remain in the western
Ukraine.

   The U.S. Forest Service is looking for
a few good pinecones.
   They need the seeds to restore about 1 million acres of Northern
California forests destroyed by fire in the past two years.
   Officials of Stanislaus National Forest on Tuesday unveiled
their so-called ``loan-a-cone program'' at a ranch here where the
owners have offered cones from 23 high-quality Ponderosa pines.
   ``We desperately need the help of private landowners who have
the cones on their trees that match our criteria,'' said Mike
Rutty, a regeneration specialist for the Forest Service.
   Officials hope to gather 1.5 tons of seeds from private
landowners. That's about 35 percent of what they need to plant
about 8.5 million trees on 811,000 acres in the Stanislaus, and
170,000 acres in the Shasta-Trinity national forests.

<HEAD>Beryl Loses Strength Inland, But Raises Hopes in Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The former tropical storm known as Beryl drifted inland today,
packing less punch but raising hopes of a hard rain for the
drought-stricken Midwest as hundreds of evacuees on the Mississippi
coast returned home.
   Other thunderstorms hit Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois and
Colorado, where flooding was reported.
   An Alabama teen-ager remained missing as Beryl was downgraded to
a tropical depression Tuesday. The Coast Guard suspended a search
for the 15-year-boy, who fell overboard Monday when a fishing boat
capsized in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The Coast Guard also rescued six people who endured two days of
wind and rain on an island 10 miles off the Mississippi coast after
high seas prevented them from returning to the mainland.
   ``I think we missed the forecast,'' said Randy Gibson of
Gilbertown, Ala., captain of the 17-foot boat.
   ``It's just a miracle that we survived,'' said his wife, Denvia.
``God took care of us and brought us home.''
   The storm had little impact on New Orleans or south Louisiana,
which was preparing to host next week's Republican National
Convention.
   ``The beneficial aspects of this tropical storm are probably
much greater than any negative effects from this system _ and
that's rain,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   In Colorado Springs, Colo., a storm Tuesday dumped more than 3
inches of rain and golf-ball size hail, turning streets into
rivers. Numerous motorists had to be rescued from floating cars.
   Firefighters were dispatched to homes and businesses where
rising water poured under doors and through electrical wall
outlets. Lightning knocked out power to 2,400 customers, and an
electric transformer exploded during the storm.
   Beryl drifted toward the west-northwest at about 5 miles an hour
early today, leaving behind higher than usual tides and some
thunderstorms. But hundreds who evacuated their coastal Mississippi
homes on Monday began returning Tuesday when the weakened storm
moved inland.
   The National Weather Service placed the storm's center near
Lafayette, La., early today. The storm, with maximum winds of 35
mph, was expected to take a more northwesterly direction later
today.
   ``We think it's going to ... turn toward the northwest up over
the Midwest area,'' said Sheets. ``We don't think it's going to go
back out over the water so there's not much chance of it ever
strengthening again.''
   However, flood warnings remained along the Mississippi coast
because of the threat of heavy rains overnight.
   Damage was confined mostly to lowland flooding, scattered tree
limbs and power outages that have since been restored.
   The Alabama youth, whose name was not given, was reported
missing Tuesday by a survivor found clinging to the hull of a
vessel that capsized Monday in the Mississippi Sound. Searchers
believe the boat was swamped by 7-foot waves.
   Thousands of workers who had been flown in from offshore oil
rigs on Monday also began returning Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   A journalist has cleared the FBI of wrongdoing in
acquiring some of his confidential notes, which he previously
believed had been stolen from his home in Costa Rica, a newspaper
reported today.
   Tony Avirgan told The Boston Globe he learned last weekend that
the FBI got the material indirectly through a CBS News colleague,
Carroll Dougherty.
   Avirgan said Dougherty told him he gave copies of the notes to
Jack Terrell, a former mercenary who was giving the FBI information
on alleged illegal activities connected with a private Nicaraguan
rebel aid network, and that Terrell gave the FBI access to some of
them.
   Avirgan said Dougherty's passing along of the material was
unauthorized and unethical.
   Doughtery said he thought he had Avirgan's permission to share
the notes with Terrell.
   ``Obviously, I had no idea the material would end up in the
hands of the FBI,'' Dougherty said.
   Two weeks ago, the Globe said 39 pages of Avirgan's material
found in the files of the FBI's field office in Washington
apparently were obtained through two break-ins at Avirgan's home in
Costa Rica. The FBI later confirmed the notes were in its files.
   Following the report, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of
the FBI oversight committee in Congress, announced an investigation
into the matter.
   Avirgan said at the time that there was no other way the
material, including notes of interviews and private memos to his
editor, could have been acquired and given to the FBI.
   ``But after investigating this incident thoroughly, we now
realize that the FBI did not obtain the documents as a result of a
break-in or any other unethical or illegal action,'' Avirgan said.
   ``We did suffer two break-ins, in 1985 and 1986, in which files
were rifled and, perhaps, photocopied,'' he said. ``We're still
looking for an explanation of those break-ins.''
   Doughtery's role was discovered last week when his handwriting
was found on one page of the material released by the FBI, the
Globe said.
   Avirgan said Doughtery was sent to Costa Rica by CBS News in
1985 to help him and his journalist wife, Martha Honey, investigate
the attempted assassination of dissident Contra leader, Eden
Pastora.
   Avirgan and his wife have filed a $24 million damage suit in
Miami accusing U.S. and Nicaraguan Contra officials of
responsibility for the bombing. The lawsuit was dismissed in June
for insufficient evidence.
   Avirgan said Dougherty told him last weekend he provided copies
of Avirgan's notes to Terrell in exchange for Terrell's material on
the private network aiding the rebels fighting to overthrow
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   But, Terrell told the Globe the material was not used in a trade.
   The FBI got copies of Avirgan's material when agents interviewed
Terrell in 1986, the Globe said. Terrell told the newspaper he gave
the FBI fewer than 39 pages but said his memory might not be
accurate.
   John Mattes, a Florida lawyer, said when Terrell was approached
by the FBI, ``I advised Terrell to cooperate fully with the FBI and
to give them everything he had. That's how CBS material got into
their files.''
   Greg Jones, a spokesman for the FBI, said Tuesday that FBI
Director William Sessions ``has maintained throughout that the
materials came to us from an individual who voluntarily provided
them to us. The FBI did not solicit the information nor did we know
how it was obtained.''

<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-tech prostitution ring used
computers to keep records on 40,000 customers, including
professional athletes and politicians, police said.
   The Berkeley-headquartered ring used beepers to dispatch escort
service ``dates,'' said Oakland police Sgt. Mike Martin.
   About 100 officers, coordinated by a task force from Oakland,
San Jose and the state Attorney General's office, served 18 search
warrants on Tuesday in San Francisco Bay area cities. They arrested
seven people.
   Martin would not disclose the customers' names, but said they
included politicians and pro athletes. He said the computer records
listed their sexual preferences along with home addresses, phone
numbers, and credit-card account numbers.
   Among those arrested was the alleged leader of the $3
million-a-year operation, Thomas Nathaniel Lusk, 48, who was
recently released from federal prison, where he served a term for
income-tax evasion.
   Lusk owned seven escort services that employed dozens of
prostitutes, who averaged $160 to $175 an hour for their services,
Martin said.
   The women communicated with the office through beepers and
telephones and couriers picked up the money or credit card vouchers.
   Lusk and four others were arrested on $500,000 warrants charging
them with multiple counts of felony pimping and pandering, police
said. The others were booked for investigation of pimping and
pandering and possession of cocaine.

<DATELINE>SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bad connection somewhere in the
telephone company has apparently caused thousands of customers to
be listed with the wrong street number in the new phone book.
   South Kingstown streets were renumbered late last year as part
of the state's new 911 emergency telephone system. Officials
delivered a list of the new street numbers to New England Telephone
Co. in February, four months before the deadline for address
changes in the new book.
   But Arthur Jones, a spokesman for the telephone company, said no
one from the phone company's 911 division passed along the new
addresses to the division that publishes the telephone books.
   ``I believe that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand
is doing at the phone company,'' said Jack Carney, the engineer in
the town Department of Public Works who coordinated the street
number changes.
   Town Council President Harold Smith urged the phone company to
publish a supplement to make the corrections instead of waiting
until next year's book.
   ``It is a big mistake, a significant mistake. I don't think we
can go a year without it being rectified,'' Smith said. ``If there
is any place that needs to have the correct address, it is the
telephone directory.''
   Officials said the problem affected a significant number of the
town's 20,968 residents, although they did not have exact figures.

<HEAD>RAF Jets Collide During Training Flight, Killing Airmen Aboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Royal Air Force Tornado jet fighters collided
during a night training flight over northwest England and the RAF
said today that three airman were killed and the fourth was missing
and presumed dead.
   The RAF said in a statement that two bodies were found before
dawn in wreckage strewn over the countryside near the village of
Milburn and the third body was later found in the same area.
   The village, in the Cumbrian hills, is about 240 miles northwest
of London.
   Rescue helicopters with powerful lights and a hill rescue team
on foot rushed to the remote, sparsely populated area after the
two-seater fighters collided Tuesday night.
   The area is regularly used for low-level training flights, with
military jets skimming just a few hundred feet over hills and farm
buildings as pilots practice avoiding radar detection by flying
under the beams.
   An eyewitness, Alan Knell, landlord of the Stag Inn in Milburn,
told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview:
   ``A big red ball (of fire) came in the sky. I didn't know
whether it was the sun coming up. It was just a mass of bright red
... and then rockets and flares went off and then there was another
sort of explosion. The noise was absolutely tremendous.''
   Knell said the planes narrowly missed the pub. He said there had
been a lot of low-level flights earlier in the day.
   The RAF said this year that it would modify its Tornado fighters
because of earlier collisions, but gave no date for completion of
the modifications. The decision followed a Defense Ministry report
in May on a December 1986 nighttime incident in which one RAF
Tornado flew into the back of another.
   The report called for improved exterior lighting and other
changes so pilots can assess distances better. All the crewmen
involved in the 1986 collision survived.
   Currently, 220 Tornados are in service in Britain and another
165 are being built for the RAF at a cost of $30 million each.
   The Tornado was jointly developed and built by Britain, West
German and Italy and first came into service in 1979.
   In the previous most recent accident involving a Tornado, two
RAF crewmen were killed when the Tornado they were in crashed in
West Germany in May.
   Legislator Dale Campbell-Savours of the opposition Labor Party
said after visiting the scene of Tuesday night's collision accused
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government of
ignoring warnings about the dangers of low-level training flights.
   ``The whole program is completely out of control,'' he charged.

<HEAD>Forecast Shows Magnitude of Drought Losses in Corn, Soybeans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought will cut U.S. corn production
about 40 percent, crop analysts say, but they hold out more hope
for improvement in soybeans.
   ``The potential for change in corn is very, very small,'' said
Jim Quinton, of the AgriVisor marketing service in Bloomington.
``Soybeans can go up, down or sideways.''
   Figures released Tuesday by AgriVisor put the 1988 corn harvest
at more than 4.3 billion bushels and the soybean harvest at less
than 1.5 billion bushels, respective declines of nearly 39 percent
and 21 percent from 1987.
   The figures followed a recent survey by the American Farm Bureau
Federation, which predicted farmers would harvest 4.34 billion
bushels of corn, down 40 percent, and 1.44 billion bushels of
soybeans, down 24 percent from last year's yields.
   ``Much of the crop damage has been done to corn and it's too
late for improved weather conditions to substantially reverse the
losses,'' said Tim Price, a federation grains specialist.
   Quinton said farmers in parts of Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota
and Nebraska probably can expect better crops than those farther
east.
   The AgriVisor estimates are based largely on an examination of
fields in 10 key farm states by a group of young farmers from
Douglas County, Ill. They drove 11,000 miles in late July and early
August, checking crops from Nebraska and South Dakota to Michigan
and Ohio.
   The bureau report is based on responses from nearly 1,400
producers surveyed in the major producing states.
   Illinois was one of the states hardest hit by the drought,
especially in the corn fields.
   Quinton said farmers in the state probably will average 67
bushels of corn per acre for a 636.5 million-bushel crop. That
compares with 132 bushels per acre in 1987 for total corn
production of 1.2 billion bushels.
   A 67-bushel corn yield would be the lowest since 1959 and the
636.5 million-bushel harvest would be the smallest since 1983, a
year of drought and of a major government acreage-reduction program.
   Illinois farmers are expected to average 28 bushels of soybeans
per acre this fall and put 243.6 million bushels into their bins,
Quinton said. They had a yield of 38 bushels per acre in 1987 for
production of 323 million bushels.
   The soybean yield and the harvest would be the smallest since
1974.
   In Iowa, where the weather has been more favorable in western
and some northern counties, farmers are expected to average 87
bushels of corn per acre for a harvest of 948.3 million bushels.
   Iowa soybeans are likely to yield 34 bushels per acre with a
total harvest of 268.6 million bushels, Quinton said.
   AgriVisor said projected corn yields in the other states were:
Indiana, 57 bushels per acre; Michigan, 58 bushels; Minnesota, 72
bushels; Missouri, 62 bushels; Nebraska, 110 bushels; Ohio, 59
bushels; South Dakota, 70 bushels; and Wisconsin, 64 bushels.
   Projected soybean yields were: Indiana, 27 bushels per acre;
Michigan, 25 bushels; Minnesota, 33 bushels; Missouri, 30 bushels;
Nebraska, 33 bushels; Ohio, 30 bushels; South Dakota, 28 bushels;
and Wisconsin, 28 bushels.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture will issue its first yield
and production estimates Thursday for this year's corn and soybean
harvests.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices plunged across the board on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange on Wednesday, setting a record for daily trading
this year, while the U.S. dollar soared against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the market's
main barometer, dropped 615.49 points, or 2.18 percent, to close at
27,554.87. It was the index's largest one-day drop since Nov. 11,
when it fell 649.70 points.
   The dollar opened at 134.93 yen, 1.35 yen higher than Tuesday's
close of 133.58 yen in Tokyo, and continued to move up. After
reaching the 135.20 yen mark in mid-morning, the highest level
since July 18, it closed at 134.92 yen, up 1.34 yen from Tuesday's
close.
   Securities dealers attributed the sharp drop of the index to the
discount rate hike by the Federal Reserve of the United States and
a 28-point fall of the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials in New
York overnight.
   ``The stock market has been sluggish to begin with,'' said a
dealer at a Tokyo brokerage. ``Then came news of sudden discount
rate hike in the U.S. and an overnight drop of Dow Jones industrial
average in New York. The combination of them caused today's sharp
fall.''
   The Nikkei index was on a three day downward stretch since
Saturday before Wednesday's trading began. It lost 254 points in
the past three days, hitting the below 28,000 mark for the first
time since July 29.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, reacting to the dollar's
surge, said the current exchange rate fluctuation was not violent
and there was no need for central bank intervention to stem the
rise.
   Kyodo News Service quoted a Bank of Japan official as saying
``We will monitor the progress in the U.S. closely, but have no
intention of changing Japan's current domestic policy stance.''
   Exchange dealers also said that profit-taking was taming the
dollar's sharp upward surge.
   ``Players who bought the dollar yesterday (Tuesday), especially
the trading houses and insurance companies, are selling it off in
profit-taking,'' said a exchange dealer at a U.S. investment bank
in Tokyo.
   ``But active buying from other sources cut in immediately after
the dollar inches down, not allowing it to fall below the 135-yen
level,'' the dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I
expect more buying later in the day.''
   Securities dealers said the morning decline in stock prices was
in response to a 28-point loss in Wall Street's Dow Jones
industrial average, which fell after the Federal Reserve Board
announcement that it was increasing the U.S. discount rate to 6.5
percent from 6.0 percent.
   An increase of the discount rate, the fee the nation's central
bank charges for short-term loans to member banks, would affect
other interest rates, including those on prime rates and mortgage
rates, to be set by commercial banks. Higher U.S. interest rates
increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments.
   ``They were more concerned about the interest rate hike in
Japan,'' said a dealer at a Tokyo brokerage. ``But the worry seems
to have cleared and I expect share prices will recover shortly.''

   George Bush is upbeat about a new poll showing
him narrowing the lead of Democratic presidential rival Michael
Dukakis, saying ``It's a nice change,'' and, ``I like it, I like
it.''
   After weeks of trailing Dukakis by as much as 17 points in some
surveys, the vice president and his staff took pains Tuesday to
bring attention to a Gallup poll that said he was only seven points
down, with Dukakis holding a 49 percent to 42 percent edge.
   The poll gives Bush a better footing for next week's Republican
National Convention, where he will be crowned the GOP presidential
nominee, by showing him in close contention with the Massachusetts
governor instead of dropping further behind.
   ``Things are moving. We're beginning to get them in focus. Watch
and you'll see these surveys turn around,'' Bush said.
   ``This is dramatic movement ... it's very encouraging. ... It's
a nice change, it's a nice turnaround,'' he told reporters in
Philadelphia at the end of a daylong trip through Pennsylvania.
   ``I told you to be patient,'' he said. ``I like it, I like it,''
he exulted.
   Tempering his optimism, Bush said, ``Polls don't matter.'' He
went on to say, ``I don't believe in polls, not even the good ones.
... I don't think polls mean anything.''
   The Gallup survey of 1,004 registered voters, conducted Friday
through Sunday, had a 3 percentage point margin of error.
   Bush's trip, with stops in Erie and Pittsburgh as well as
Philadelphia, was his last outing before he goes to the convention
in New Orleans.
   Today and Thursday, he is taping separate, hour-long interviews
in Washington with the four major television networks for broadcast
during the convention.
   Bush also continued work on his search for a running mate. Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the vice president asked him and four
other guests on Air Force II about their recommendations but gave
no clue to his thinking.
   Specter said the consensus of the guests was that the No. 2 job
should go to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who
unsuccessfully challenged Bush for the nomination.
   ``I know Dole could do it,'' Specter said. ``Dole ought to
appear in front of Boston Bay and say that Dukakis could walk on
water and the reason is it is full of sludge and solid waste
disposal.''
   Bush said at a news conference that his decision was not
imminent. ``I'm not close in the sense of, like tomorrow, making a
final decision,'' the vice president said. He has said he wants to
keep it a secret until the final day of the convention, which
begins Monday.
   Bush also stepped up his attack against Dukakis, saying his
opponent was trying to avoid being specific on issues.
   ``He is trying to run away from a record in Massachusetts on the
very, very far liberal fringe of the political spectrum and I have
to pin him down,'' Bush said. ``And he's unwilling to do that
because he thinks he can preempt the middle.'
   Emphasizing policy differences with Dukakis, Bush said, ``When
he says he's against the death penalty for everything, the country
has a right to know it. I happen to think some crimes are bad
enough. You should.
   ``When he says he wants to take guns away from people, why then,
the country ought to know that,'' the vice president added.
   Bush said he was urging speakers at the GOP convention to be
positive and to focus on the issues.
   ``But I can't guarantee that somebody's not going to take a
swipe at Michael Dukakis,'' Bush said. ``I have a lot of friends
out there and they didn't like the vicious, personal attacks
(against Bush at the Democratic convention) and I did not react to
them. But I can't control everybody, but I'm urging them to stay
positive, as I'm doing.''
   Bush added, ``There's a lot of people out there that want to go
after 'em. There's a lot of people that feel it was a very unfair,
totally negative tune there.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The increase in the U.S. discount rate upset Tokyo
investors today, causing a major drop in stock prices and a sharp
increase in the dollar against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the market's
main barometer, fell 615.49 points, or 2.18 percent, to close at
27,554.87. It was the largest one-day drop of the index since Nov.
11, 1987, when it fell 649.70 points.
   The volume traded on the first section of the exchange was 700
million shares compared to 650 million Tuesday.
   Securities dealers attributed the drop to the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board's half-percentage point increase in its discount rate
to 6.5 percent on Tuesday and the subsequent 28-point fall in the
Down Jones average in New York.
   ``The stock market has been sluggish to begin with,'' said a
dealer at a Tokyo brokerage, speaking anonymously.
   He said news of the Federal Reserve's action and the New York
Stock Exchange tumble came as a surprise, and ``the combination of
them caused today's sharp fall.''
   An increase in the discount rate, which the central bank charges
for short-term loans to member banks, would in turn affect the
interest rates the commercial banks charge.
   However, another Tokyo dealer, also speaking anonymously, said
investors had been prepared for the interest rate increase for some
time and ``were more concerned about any interest rate increase in
Japan. But the worry seems to have cleared, and I expect share
prices will recover shortly.''
   The Nikkei index had previously fallen for three straight days,
shedding 254 points and dipping below the 28,000 mark for the first
time since July 29.
   On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency remained
strong throughout the day's trade.
   The dollar opened at 134.93 yen, 1.35 yen higher than Tuesday's
close, and continued to rise. After reaching the 135.20-yen mark in
mid-morning, the highest level since July 18, it closed at 134.92
yen, up 1.34 yen from the day before.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, reacting to the dollar's
surge, was quoted by Japanese newspapers as saying the current
exchange rate fluctuation was not violent and that there was no
need for central bank intervention to stem the rise.
   Kyodo News Service quoted an unidentified Bank of Japan official
as saying: ``We will monitor the progress in the U.S. closely, but

rise of the dollar.
   ``Players who bought the dollar yesterday, especially the

profit-taking,'' said an exchange dealer at a U.S. investment bank

<HEAD>NYC Starting Ads Urging People To Ignore Beggars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch has announced an
advertising campaign to encourage people to give money to charities
rather than to panhandlers because, he says, most beggars are
trying to rip people off.
   The advertisements on subways will urge people to donate money
to charities, so ``they will know the money will go not for booze,
not for drugs, but to provide maintenance for these people,'' the
mayor said Tuesday.
   ``I'm concerned that people are giving lots of money
collectively, and in most cases _ not all _ it's a scam,'' Koch
said. ``People who say they are starving _ it is simply not true.
In most cases, they are demented.''
   Koch added that panhandlers who don't take advantage of the
city's shelter and welfare system are either ``mentally disturbed,
or it's a scam.''
   There are no statistics on the number of panhandlers in New
York, but groups who work with the homeless say they number in the
thousands.
   The subway signs will describe the city's public assistance
programs so that people can make an educated decision about whether
to give money, Koch said. The signs also may include a phone number
to offer beggars that would direct them to places where they can be
assisted.
   ``I don't want New York City to become a city where people think
it's OK to assume the role of beggars as if it were a profession,''
the mayor said.
   Human Resources Administration Director William J. Grinker, who
is developing the advertising campaign, called the beggars ``an
increasingly intrusive part of urban life that has gotten to be
like graffiti.''
   But Christina Walker, director of the Food and Hunger Hotline,
an association of 600 soup kitchens and food pantries, said
suggestions that people are begging because they choose to, or are
mentally ill or addicted to drugs or alcohol is a ``useful myth.
... People are asking for money because they need money to
survive.''
   Almost all soup kitchens are closed on weekends and in the
evenings, Walker said, and the food pantries are aimed toward
people with homes. All food providers must limit the number they
can serve, she said, and thousands are turned away daily.
   In a survey last year by the Legal Action Center for the
Homeless of 500 men who attend soup kitchens in the city, 69
percent said they receive no public assistance. Of these, 42
percent said they were forced to panhandle to survive.

   A review of videotapes of a park confrontation
between police and protesters in which 53 people were injured shows
officers may have used excessive force, the mayor and police
commissioner say.
   ``The films that I saw the other day are very disturbing,''
Mayor Edward I Koch said Tuesday, adding that the officers may have
legitimate explanations for their conduct last weekend.
   But Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said he would be surprised
if some of the officers could justify the actions that caused irate
residents to file 40 charges of brutality.
   ``There is some behavior that was captured on tape that I think
the individual officers that are involved are going to have great
difficulty explaining,'' Ward said.
   A riot involving 450 demonstrators and 400 officers broke out at
Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan's Lower East Side as police tried
to enforce a 1 a.m. curfew on Sunday. In the wake of the riot, Koch
suspended enforcement of the curfew to prevent further violence.
   Police had gone to Tompkins Square because of complaints from
residents of the gentrifying neighborhood that the park was a
nighttime hangout for drug dealers, rowdy drunks, homeless people
and so-called punk rockers, who dress in black leather and spike
their hair.
   Among the 53 injured were 14 police officers.
   During the confrontation, several officers in one of the tapes
apparently tried to hide their badge numbers with black bands, the
New York Post reported today. One officer apparently was not
wearing a badge, it said.
   Failure to display badge numbers and name plates is a violation
of departmental regulations.
   The Civilian Complaint Review Board, which is comprised of
civilians and police representatives, appealed to residents of the
East Village area to come forward with their complaints and to help
identify officers who used excessive force.
   ``This is a priority case; it will be given our full
attention,'' said Deputy Commissioner Sandra Marsh, who anticipated
a long investigation because of the number of complaints.
   After the panel looks at the evidence, it sends its
recommendation to the police commissioner, who can accept it or
reject it.
   The most severe recommendation is to charge the officer with a
breach of department discipline. The officer would face a
departmental trial, which could lead to dismissal.

<HEAD>U.S. Navy Probes Ship Crew For Not Rescuing Refugees</HEAD>

   The U.S. Navy is investigating
allegations that the crew of a Navy ship refused to rescue some
Vietnamese boat people who later resorted to murder and cannibalism
to survive at sea, officials said today.
   Navy officials said the sailors reported giving food and water
to the boat people, not considering them to be in dire straits.
   ``We've made all information available to the United States, and
we know they are conducting an investigation and are very serious
about it,'' said Robert Cooper, local representative of the U.N.
High Commission on Refugees. Cooper said in a telephone interview
that the probe began last month.
   He said the 52 refugees who survived the 37-day ordeal charged
that crewmen of the USS Dubuque refused to take them aboard, even
though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure and
starvation.
   Cooper said the refugees reported that 58 people died during the
South China Sea crossing, which began May 22 when the group left
the south Vietnamese port of Ben Tre aboard a 35-foot wooden boat.
   Its engine failed two or three days later.
   By the June 9 encounter with the Dubuque, according to the
refugees, ``there was one dead refugee aboard, the motor was not
working, they were drifting for 19 days, people had died of
exposure, hunger and thirst,'' Cooper said.
   The refugees claimed to have later killed some of their
companions and eaten their flesh to survive. Cooper said the
``great majority'' of other deaths also occurred after the
encounter with the Dubuque.
   Officials at Subic Bay Naval Base, northwest of Manila, and at
the U.S. Navy's Surface Force Pacific Fleet office in San Diego,
Calif., confirmed that an investigation was under way.
   They said the Dubuque's commander reported that the refugee boat
was seaworthy and that they left the Vietnamese after giving them
more than 400 pounds of food, 50 gallons of water, navigational
charts and sailing directions.
   A Navy spokesman, Cmdr. David Dillon in San Diego, said he did
not think the crew would have turned the refugees away if their
boat was disabled.
   The Manila Chronicle quoted some of the refugees as saying the
crew told them the Dubuque was on a ``dangerous mission'' and could
not take them aboard.
   Dillon said the Dubuque was headed for the Persian Gulf, but
that its destination would not have been an excuse not to rescue
the Vietnamese if their boat was in distress.
   ``It's not a (Navy) policy not to allow refugees on board,'' he
said. ``It's a policy to render humanitarian assistance whenever
needed and however possible. In this case, the commanding officer
judged their craft to be seaworthy.''
   Dillon said Navy policy directs ships to be alert for refugees
on the high seas and assist them as needed. The policy calls for
ships to pick up refugees if their boat is disabled or in case of
bad weather.
   Filipino fishermen rescued the Vietnamese off northern Luzon
island on June 27. They were taken to a refugee camp housing more
than 4,000 other Vietnamese refugees on Palawan island.
   Cooper said investigators had not determined how many people the
refugees killed.
   ``Some said more (than three) were killed, some said less than
three,'' he said.
   Cooper said the alleged mastermind of the cannibalism was in
protective custody to prevent other refugees from harming him.
   The Manila Chronicle identified the first alleged victim as a
30-year-old man named Dao Coung, who wept and pleaded to be spared.
   ``Why not wait until I starve to death?'' Coung reportedly said
before two men grabbed him by the feet and submerged his head in
the sea until he was dead, the paper reported.
   Cooper said that if the allegations against the Navy crew prove
true, it would be the first time the U.S. Navy has failed to
adequately help a group of boat people since they began fleeing
after the fall of South Vietnam to the communists in 1975.

   Millions of Americans people switched on porch lights and
gathered for block parties to promote safe neighborhoods, hoping to
turn ``the clock back about 30 years'' during the fifth annual
National Night Out Against Crime.
   The national observances Tuesday included rallies, candlelight
vigils and a balloon release. In an inner-city Boston neighborhood,
between 500 and 600 people, mainly families with children, turned
out for pony rides, a magic show and ``bucket rides'' in a
telephone company cherry-picker truck.
   ``We gave them a night of freedom, a night free of drugs and
free of pressure. They just became kids of their age again,'' said
Georgette Watson, an organizer of the event.
   Before a crowd of about 500 people gathered at a downtown
Philadelphia fountain, Vice President George Bush switched on a
giant light bulb at 8 p.m. Tuesday, signaling more than 18 million
people in more than 7,200 towns to follow suit.
   ``The greatest enemy in the war against crime is fear,'' Bush
told a crowd of about 500 gathered at a downtown fountain here.
   Matt Peskin, project coordinator for the Philadelphia-based
National Town Watch Association, which oversees the event, said he
was encouraged by the participation.
   ``The event turns the clock back about 30 years to a time when
neighbors routinely kept an eye out for each other, kids played
outside until well after sunset and people knew the cop on the
beat,'' Peskin said.
   According to the organization, each year an increasing number of
people participate in the night out. This year, citizens in all 50
states, all the U.S. terrorities and at hundreds of U.S. military
bases around the world were expected to turn on their lights.
   Once turned on, the lights were supposed to shine all night
while police monitored statistics on effectiveness and citizens
considered ways to continue drawing attention to crime fighting.
   Each year, National Town Watch ranks the top 25 cities
participating. Peskin said last year's top ranked city, St. Louis,
made another fine showing this year with 400 to 500 block parties.
   In New York City, plagued by allegations of police brutality at
a park riot earlier this week, Mayor Edward I. Koch and Police
Commissioner Benjamin Ward addressed several hundred people at a
rally in Manhattan.
   ``It is important that you never give up on your city, you never
give up on your neighborhood. The whole purpose behind this
National Night Out is to show the bad guys that we're not going to
give up,'' Ward said.
   Nearly 300 residents of Highland Park, a Detroit enclave,
gathered near city hall Tuesday night, holding hands in a human
chain.
   Neighborhoods in Kansas City blazed with porch lights,
flashlights and candles as residents joined in the demonstration
and Mayor Richard L. Berkley joined a rally of about 75 people in a
midtown neighborhood that included a candlelight vigil.
   In Arcadia, Calif., Gloria Alerich said she spent about 4{ hours
Tuesday helping inflate 2,000 helium balloons bearing the message
``Lights On Means Lights Out for Crime.''
   A total of 3,000 to 4,000 balloons were released from scores of
neighborhoods in the Los Angeles suburb.
   Since 1984, the event has symbolized demands for safe
neighborhoods. The anti-crime demonstration now includes opposition
to drugs.
   Electric industry officials estimate that leaving several lights
on all night for a year would cost the average homeowner about $30.

<HEAD>Six More Former Exchange Officials Charged in Bribery Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today charged six former
officials of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with violating
anti-bribery laws in a widening corruption probe that has shaken up
the exchange's leadership.
   The Independent Commission Against Corruption also said in a
statement that additional charges were filed against former
exchange chairman Ronald Li Fook-shiu and Jeffrey Sun Hon-kuen, the
former chief executive.
   Each of the eight defendants faces seven years in jail and a
$64,100 fine if convicted.
   Four defendants face three counts each of accepting preferential
allotments of shares in connection with the flotation, or listing
of new shares of stock, of three companies on the exchange, the
commission said.
   The statement identified the four as Charles Sin Cho-chiu, 52,
who succeeded Li as chairman last year; former exchange vice
chairmen Kenneth Wong Kai-ming, 57; Cham Siu-leun, 66; and John
Chong Lap-hong, 53.
   The companies named by the agency were Videotechnology
International Ltd., Q.P.L. Ltd., and Hysan Development Co. Ltd.
   Two other new defendants _ former exchange vice chairman Joseph
Ma Ching-chung, 51, and former exchange governing committee member
Edward Woo Pak-hay, 50 _ are each charged with two similar counts
in connection with Q.P.L. and Hysan, the commission statement said.
   Li was charged in January with accepting a special allotment of
shares from the Kumagai Gumi Ltd. construction company in exchange
for approving the firm's listing on the stock exchange.
   The agency today also charged Li with accepting preferential
allotments of shares in connection with the flotation of Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd., Videotech, Q.P.L. and Hysan, and with
accepting sub-underwriting commissions related to Cathay Pacific,
the statement said.
   Sun, already facing charges in connection with Videotech and
Q.P.L., was charged with an additional count concerning the Hysan
stock flotation, the statement said.
   A spokeswoman for the commission said no other details of the
charges would be released until the defendents appear in court
Thursday. All eight men have been released on bail.
   David Gledhill, Hong Kong chairman of Cathay Pacific's parent
company, refused comment on the charges.
   He said in a statement that ``neither Cathay Pacific nor the
Swire Group (parent company), nor any of their management were
aware until the ... investigation that there was any suggestion
that Ronald Li had allegedly obtained an advantage out of the
flotation of Cathay Pacific.''
   A woman who answered the telephone at Li's office said he was
not in.
   A Videotech spokesman said the company was unaware of details of
the charges but had cooperated with the investigation. Q.P.L and
Hysan said officials were unavailable for comment.
   Soon after Li's arrest in December, the exchange reshuffled its
leadership in a move prompted by a government request that seven
members of its general committee be suspended from management until
the investigation ended.
   The seven members included Li and all those charged today except
Chong.

   The delay while Prince Andrew and his wife Sarah
decided what to call their baby daughter had commemorative mug
makers tense, bookmakers in a lather and newspapers in a fever of
speculation today.
   The Times of London said bookmakers offered short odds on
Annabel and Victoria. It said Victoria was more likely because of
Queen Victoria.
   Andrew, the Duke of York, reportedly said several months ago
that Annabel was his own choice for a baby girl.
   Mike Raper, an executive at bookmakers William Hill, said
oddsmakers at one stage had taken bets at 3-1 on Annabel as the
favorite but had stopped.
   ``If it is Annabel, we will have to pay out thousands and
thousands of pounds,'' he said.
   Wally Pyrah of Coral Bookmakers said Charlotte was also strongly
favored.
   ``Charlotte ... has seen the odds tumble from 14-1 to 6-4
favorite. I hope that doesn't mean that everyone knows before us,''
he said.
   ``The second favorite (among Coral gamblers) is Victoria at 5-2
followed by two very popular names, Annabel and Elizabeth, at
4-1,'' Pyrah added.
   Frank Martin, managing director of the ceramics division of the
wallpaper and home products group Coloroll, said he had 10,000
commemorative mugs waiting to be rushed to stores.
   Blank spaces were left on the mugs for the name. ``We have the
artwork all ready to go. As soon as we know the baby's name we can
rush them out within 24 hours,'' he said.
   The Times said another name being tipped was Elizabeth, after
Queen Elizabeth I and the present queen, Elizabeth II.
   It said a wild outsider was Francesca, after Sir Francis Drake.
   The Daily Telegraph reported: ``Elizabeth and Victoria are
thought to be public favorites but Mary, Margaret, Harriet and
Louisa are also tipped as likely names.''
   Andrew, 28, told crowds outside London's Portland Hospital on
Tuesday after visiting his 28-year-old wife and baby daughter: ``We
have a few ideas but we haven't chosen a name yet.''
   Mothercare, a big retail chain specializing in maternity and
baby clothes, has introduced a Grand Old Duke of York design for
crib bedding and other items to mark the royal birth. The Grand Old
Duke of York referred to was Queen Victoria's uncle Frederick, who
became a nursery rhyme figure when, on a whim, he marched 10,000
soldiers up a hill one day and then down again.
   Baby food makers Cow and Gate marked the occasion by producing
give-away mobiles to hang over cribs consisting of a crown, a
plane, a palace, a cow and a gate.

<HEAD>Beryl Heads Northwest After Dropping Heavy Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical depression Beryl was heading northwest over Louisiana
early today after dropping 1 to 2 inches of rain on southwest
Mississippi and southern Louisiana.
   The center of the depression, which was downgraded from a
tropical storm on Tuesday, was near Lafayette, La., and was
expected to continue toward the northwest.
   On Tuesday evening, strong thunderstorms produced wind damage in
west-central Texas. Winds gusted to 59 mph near Midland.
   Thunderstorms dumped heavy rain over central New Mexico on
Tuesday afternoon, causing local flooding. A 20-foot section of a
bridge was washed out at Sandia Knolls, and considerable flooding
of streets and dry gullies was reported at Albuquerque when over an
inch of rain fell within an hour.
   Other showers and thunderstorms fell over eastern Colorado,
where large hail accompanied heavy rain in Colorado Springs;
south-central Nebraska, Missouri, west-central Illinois, Florida
and the coast of the Carolinas. The weather was fair over the rest
of the nation.
   The high for the nation Tuesday was 110 degrees at Bullhead
City, Ariz.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included more than 2{ inches at the Marine Corps base at Cherry
Point, N.C., more than 1 1@3 inches at Lafayette, La., and
Albuquerque, and nearly an inch at Altus Air Force Base, Okla.
   For today, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast for
portions of the Ohio Valley and the southern half of the middle
Mississippi Valley, and from eastern Texas and the lower
Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast and Florida.
Thunderstorms were predicted be most numerous over the central Gulf
Coast and Louisiana in association with Beryl. Additional showers
and thunderstorms were forecast for central Oklahoma, central New
Mexico, and northern New England. The rest of the nation was
expected to have mostly sunny skies.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 80s and 90s across much
of the nation; in the 70s in portions of the California coast and
northwest Washington state; 95-100 from central Texas into southern
Kansas; and 100-110 over the desert Southwest and the valleys of
California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 90 at Phoenix, Ariz.

   ``It appears everything has gone well,'' said launch control
center commentator Hugh Harris. Officials hoped to have a
preliminary report on the ground-shaking firing within hours.
   At the end of a near-flawless countdown, the three main liquid
fuel engines at the base of the delta-winged spaceship flashed to
life. The launch pedestal was engulfed in a huge cloud of steam as
the fiery exhaust collided with tons of protective water pouring
over the foundation of the structure.
   Discovery's three 7,000-pound engines generated total thrust
equal to the energy output of 23 Hoover Dams as eight 3-foot-long
hardened steel bolts held the spaceship on the launch pad.

<HEAD>Jailers Give Convict Gun, Videotape Escape Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENDLETON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate who used a what he thought was
a smuggled gun in an escape attempt found out two days later that
he was an unwitting participant in a training exercise and that the
weapon carried blanks.
   ``He was making statements that he'd almost made it,'' Umatilla
County Sheriff Jim Carey said Tuesday.
   Stanley Bernson, a 52-year-old murderer who had tried to escape
three times from the county jail since 1986, had asked a guard to
help him break out, Carey said.
   With the sheriff's permission, the jailer ``smuggled'' a gun and
bullets into Bernson's cell. However, the firing pin had been
removed and the gunpowder taken out of the bullets.
   ``Our goal was to find out what it would take if it was the real
thing, and how he would react,'' Carey said. ``The adrenaline was
flowing like it was really going down.''
   Bernson pulled the gun on two guards Saturday, the sheriff said.
``When he stepped out of his cell, he told them to empty their
wallets and put their watches on the floor, and he ordered them
into the cell,'' Carey said.
   ``Then we allowed him from there on into a corridor, which we
had already pre-planned. Then we played it out in a way that made
sense to him.''
   Bernson was trapped by locked doors at each end of the corridor
and was forced to negotiate with guards watching him through a
video camera. The escape attempt lasted 22 minutes and ended when
Bernson gave himself up.
   ``We just talked to him and observed him and saw how he reacted
to things we did,'' Carey said. ``He de-escalated pretty fast.''
   Bernson did not try to fire the gun during the escape attempt,
Carey said.
   Bernson is awaiting trial in the 1978 slaying of a 15-year-old
girl and is serving a life sentence for murdering a Richland,
Wash., woman in 1979. He was transferred to the jail from the
Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.
   ``He's a big concern for us,'' the sheriff said. ``I used
unusual measures this time. I've really got a unique problem with a
unique individual.''
   Bernson's attorney, Dennis A. Hachler, declined to comment on
the incident because of a judge's gag order in the murder case.

   Thousands of New Yorkers who took a cue from
the date and bet the lottery number 8-8-8 on Monday weren't wrong.
They were just early.
   Eight-eight-eight was drawn Tuesday and paid out a total of
$6,065,100 to thousands of people, a record payout for any
three-digit or four-digit number in the lottery's history, said
lottery spokesman George J. Yamin.
   On Monday, the much-awaited 8-8-88, the winning number was an
unremarkable 2-1-8.
   Enough people carried over their 8-8-8 from Monday to break the
previous record payout of $5,125,000 for the numbers 7-7-7-7, drawn
in the last week of August 1987 in the Lottery's daily WinFour
game, Yamin said.
   Officials were unsure how many individual 8-8-8 tickets were
sold, Yamin said.
   Demand for 8-8-8 in the numbers game was so great that the
lottery stopped accepting bets on that number at 11:45 a.m.
Tuesday, he said. On Monday, bets on 8-8-8 were halted at 9 a.m.,
he said.
   The lottery limits the total amount that can be bet on any one
combination of numbers to $10,000, capping the maximum total payout
at $5 million normally, Yamin said. But a special promotion this
week boosted the prize for a winning $1 bet to $600 from the usual
$500, increasing the total payout to $6 million, he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Meet In London To Discuss Seal Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists from European countries bordering the
North and Baltic seas today began a two-day meeting to discuss the
deaths of thousands of seals along their coasts, the environmental
group Greenpeace said.
   Greenpeace, which is sponsoring the meeting with the University
of London, said the scientists will assess the extent of the
deaths, the cause and any possible action which may be taken.
   ``While governments argue over who is to blame for the current
crises in the North and Baltic seas, the common seal in this area
faces extinction,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Andrew Booth.
   The 12 scientists attending the meeting come from Britain,
Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and Sweden, said
Greenpeace press spokeswomen Sue Adams.
   A virus is suspected as the cause of the seals' deaths. West
German environmentalists have blamed the virus on waste from
industry, but scientists say they do not really know its exact
cause. The deaths began early this year.

   A Soviet Jewish refusenik family who
became the center of a superpower tug-of-war during the Moscow
summit emigrated to the West today, ending an 11-year struggle to
leave their homeland.
   Yuri and Tanya Zieman and their 12-year-old daughter Vera smiled
broadly as they stepped off an Aeroflot jet from Moscow to a warm
welcome from Western friends, U.S. Embassy officials and HIAS, an
organization that helps emigre Soviet Jews.
   Asked how she felt on arriving in the West at last, Mrs. Zieman
said simply, ``Stunned.'' Her daughter, clutching a welcome bouquet
from wellwishers, giggled, ``Excited.''
   The family will stay in Vienna until Friday, when they will fly
to Boston for a reunion with an older daughter who emigrated in
1987 with her husband.
   Several dozen friends and relatives gathered for a champagne
toast at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport today to celebrate the
Ziemans' departure.
   ``I'm glad you're all here,'' Zieman told the group. ``I invite
you all to my new home.'' Zieman is a former computer specialist
who has held odd jobs since applying to emigrate, and was seriously
ill earlier in the year.
   In Vienna, he said he now feels ``much better. I'm so excited
that it sometimes seems to me that all my sicknesses are behind
me.''
   In Moscow, Mrs. Zieman called her departure ``one of the most
difficult moments of one's life.''
   ``It's like your own funeral in a way because most of the people
who are here today I won't see again _ my old teachers, relatives,
friends,'' she said.
   The family spent a sleepless night clearing customs at the
Moscow airport and saying goodbye to friends, she said.
   U.S. diplomats said President Reagan had planned to visit the
Zieman family at their south Moscow apartment during the summit
meeting May 29 to underscore the United States' concern for human
rights in the Soviet Union.
   But they said a high-ranking Soviet official told the Americans
that if Reagan visited the family they never would be allowed to
emigrate.
   Reagan did not visit the family, and two weeks after he left
they were told their application had been refused again and that
they should reapply in 1992. However, within weeks they received
official permission to leave.
   Soviet officials previously had rejected their applications for
emigration, saying the Ziemans had access to state secrets.
   The Zieman family was among the most prominent of those
remaining in the Soviet Union in the year since officials began
granting permission for the best-known refuseniks to emigrate.

<HEAD>Shamir: Israel Will Crush Any Attempt To Declare Palestinian State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that
Israel would maintain its control of the West Bank and crush any
Palestinian attempt to declare an independent state in the occupied
territories.
   Shamir's 20-minute speech came during a special session of
Israel's 120-seat parliament. It was convened to debate the
decision by King Hussein of Jordan to cut legal and administrative
ties with the West Bank, which Jordan annexed in 1950 and Israel
captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Left-wing politicians called for the debate to discuss Israel's
response to Hussein's announcement. They argued Israel should
explore peace prospects with the 1.5 million Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But Shamir, referring to a Palestinian initiative to declare a
Palestinian state in occupied lands, said:
   ``Israel will prevent in the most determined way any attempt to
carry out any idea _ to the extent that there are madmen who raise
it _ of establishing a Palestinian government. Such people will be
met with an iron fist that will leave no trace of their attempts.''
   The proposed declaration, which was made public last week, calls
for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, parts of the
Galilee and east Jerusalem. Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes
trading any Israeli-held territory for a peace pact.
   Shamir said Jordan's steps ``were aimed first and foremost
against the PLO'' and would ``harm the Arab residents and not the
state of Israel, which will continue to maintain legal and security
control as always.''
   In an interview published Tuesday with the Saudi Arabian
newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, the chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, was quoted as saying he
preferred not to say much about Jordan's disassociation from the
West Bank ``so as not to explode the situation with Jordan.''
   Shamir also appealed to Palestinians to end their uprising
against Israel. Since Dec. 8, 238 Palestinians and four Israelis
have died in the uprising.
   Yossi Sarid of the liberal Citizens Rights Movement criticized
both the Likud and the Labor Party led by Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres, saying they had failed to take advantage of Hussein's speech.
   Peres had relied on Hussein to negotiate on the behalf of
Palestinians and get around Israeli opposition to dealing with the
PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.
   Gadi Yatziv from the Socialist Mapam Party criticized Shamir for
continuing ``to bomb, to explode, to deport, to arrest and to
harass the soul of the whole (Palestinian) people.''
   ``You must know there is nothing to be accomplished by
deportations when people are fighting for their freedom,'' Yatziv
said. ``Make peace now.''
   Since Dec. 8, Israel has deported 29 Palestinians.
   Also today, assailants hurled two firebombs at a military
vehicle in the West Bank town of Ramallah, wounding one soldier,
the army said.
   Troops closed and searched the area. Arab witnesses said
soldiers rounded up about 300 Palestinians and broke into shops
during the search.

   A U.S. drug agent was killed following hours
of torture because Mexican drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero got
``carried away,'' a defendant in the murder case was seen saying on
videotape.
   Raul Lopez Alvarez, 28, made the comments in Spanish to an
undercover drug agent during a conversation at a Los Angeles hotel.
The 15-minute videotape, with English subtitles, was played for the
jury Tuesday.
   Drug agent Enrique Camarena was kidnapped in Guadalajara,
Mexico, in 1985. His body and that of his pilot were found buried
at a remote ranch in Mexico several weeks later. They had been
severely beaten and Camarena's skull was shattered.
   The videotape was of a conversation between Lopez and Abel
Reynoso, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent who posed as a
drug trafficker, the agent testified during the federal trial of
three Mexicans.
   ``A justifiable death never brings you problems,'' Lopez is
heard saying, adding that unjustifiable slayings do bring problems.
   ``Camarena was justifiable?'' Reynoso asked.
   ``That was a mistake,'' Lopez responded. ``The idea wasn't to
kill him.''
   A transcript showed Lopez suggesting the intitial plan was to
get Camarena to join forces with the drug traffickers _ ``to get
him on our side.''
   The killing took place because ``He's very hasty, because he's
young.''
   ``Who?'' Reynoso asked.
   ``Caro, because he's young,'' Lopez said. ``Because he's very
full of life. ... He got carried away.''
   Reynoso said Lopez admitted he was ``with the people watching
over Camarena.''
   The agent said Lopez told him that men using Mexican federal
police credentials lured Camarena into their car outside the U.S.
consulate in Guadalajara and that the agent was beaten with pipes
heated in fire.
   The government claims the crimes were orchestrated by Caro, 33,
who is imprisoned in Mexico where he and two others are being tried
for the offenses.
   During cross-examination, Lopez attorney Yolanda Barrera
suggested that Lopez made up everything he told the agent, basing
his story on what he read in newspapers and heard on the streets.
   Lopez and Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, are charged with murdering
Camarena and Camarena's pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. Jesus Felix
Gutierrez, 38, is charged with helping Caro flee Mexico after
Camarena's slaying.

<HEAD>Arafat Says Jordan Cut Ties To West Bank Without Telling Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has criticized
Jordan for failing to notify him before severing ties with the
Israeli-occupied lands, but he said the PLO is capable of taking
over Jordan's administrative role.
   Arafat also expressed anger at other Arab countries for failing
to tell him about Jordan's plans for the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where an uprising against Israeli rule has been under way for eight
months.
   The remarks, Arafat's first since King Hussein of Jordan cut
ties with the occupied lands, were published Tuesday in the Saudi
Arabian newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat. Copies of the paper were
obtained in Manama today.
   In the interview, Arafat also said his Arab allies had failed to
adequately fund the uprising, and he ruled out sending a joint
Palestinian-Jordanian delegation to a proposed Middle East peace
conference.
   ``The PLO was not consulted beforehand and was not officially
notified until after the measures (by Jordan) were announced, when
it (the PLO) is the party that is directly concerned in all this,''
said Arafat.
   He insisted the Palestine Liberation Organization is capable of
assuming Jordan's administrative role in the occupied lands. He
assured the 1.5 million Palestinians living there that the PLO's
institutions ``are capable of absorbing everything.''
   Arafat declined to speak at length, he said, ``so as not to
explode the situation with Jordan.''
   King Hussein also recently scrapped a proposed West Bank
development project, dissolved the lower house of Parliament, where
30 out of 60 representatives were from the West Bank, and stopped
paying the salaries of about 21,000 teachers, health workers and
civil servants in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Hussein, whose nation lost the West Bank to Israel in 1967, said
he acted because the PLO was the sole legitimate representative of
Palestinians.
   Arafat noted Hussein said he had notified some Arab capitals
about Jordan's plans but that none had in turn told Arafat.
   The PLO leader also commented on an international peace
conference on the Middle East proposed by the United States.
Despite several visits to the region, Secretary of State George
Shultz has won little support for the plan.
   Arafat rejected sending a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation
to such a conference because ``that idea has been erased from our
dictionary even though Jordan has been repeating it.'' He said the
PLO prefers a pan-Arab delegation, adding: ``We accept the idea of
a joint delegation with Egypt.''
   The Arab world backed the PLO as the sole legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people at the Arab summit in
Algiers in June. Arab leaders also agreed to financially support
the Palestinian uprising with $128 million in aid, but Arafat said
they had not fulfilled their commitment.
   Since Dec. 8, more than 230 Palestinians and four Israelis have
been killed in the uprising in the occupied lands. The uprising is
led by underground leaders with ties to the PLO.
   Arafat was interviewed in Bulgaria before returning to the Iraqi
capital of Baghdad. The trip to Bulgaria followed a meeting of the
PLO Central Council to debate the implications of King Hussein's
announcement.

   The Amalgamated Transit Union said drivers approved the
three-year contract Tuesday. Vote totals were not released.
   The union represents more than 600 of the 700 bus and streetcar

   Negotiators for the union and the Regional Transit Authority
reached a tentative agreement Sunday night, hours before a strike
deadline of 12:01 a.m. Monday.
   Top pay for drivers is now $10.10 an hour. Under the new

<HEAD>Radical Students Demonstrate For March To North</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students staged demonstrations
across the nation today to call for reunification with communist
North Korea and clashes with police erupted around some campuses.
   Radicals staged protests in Seoul and other cities to prepare
for a march Monday to the border truce site of Panmunjom for talks
with North Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided Korean
peninsula. The Seoul government has banned the march and talks.
   ``March to Panmumjom'' and ``Yankee go home,'' students chanted.
   The government mobilized 34,000 riot police today to contain
demonstrations. Police said they arrested some 200 students in
Seoul for taking part in the demonstrations.
   Authorities declined to give figures on the number of protests,
but Korean news reports said several thousand students took part in
demonstrations at about 30 universities. Turnout appeared less than
radical leaders had called for.
   Students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed with riot police
at four colleges in Seoul when they were blocked from marching into
the streets. The clashes were sporadic and no injuries were
reported, witnesses said.
   Some 300 students shouting slogans and brandishing firebombs and
clubs demonstrated around Myongdong Roman Catholic Cathedral in the
center of Seoul. Hundreds of riot police ringed the area, but did
not try to disperse the students.
   About 60 students were arrested by police when they tried to
march to the Blue House presidential mansion.
   Scattered street clashes were reported in the southern port city
of Pusan where about 500 students clashed with riot police who
fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrations.
   Bands of students attacked a police station and an office of the
governing Democratic Justice Party in Pusan, police said. Two
police officers were injured by rocks and a police bus was set
ablaze, they said.
   Protesters demanded the Seoul government agree to North Korea's
demand to be allowed to be a co-host for the Olympic Games that
start Sept. 17. The International Olympic Committee has rejected
North Korea's demand.
   ``The south and the north to the Olympic. Yankees to America,''
shouted protesters, who also want withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   The government has warned it will block the march to the border
and said no talks will be allowed with North Korean
representatives. A similar march attempt in June was blocked by the
government.
   The government insists it alone can handle contacts with North
Korea. It has promised to arrange student meetings with the north.
   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try
and mobilize public support. The radicals, a small but powerful
minority on college campuses, have failed to gain support because
of their violent tactics and open advances to the north.
   Most South Koreans fear the totalitarian north is determined to
conquer the peninsula and recall how the north invaded the south in
1950 to start the Korean War.
   The students say they are not communists, but insist that the
peninsula must be reunited immediately with political differences
being worked out later.

<HEAD>South African Troops Begin Withdrawal from Angola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ South African soldiers today
began their withdrawal from Angola in the first phase of a peace
plan that could lead to independence for South-West Africa, the
continent's last colony.
   Military officials declined to discuss details of the pullout
but said the estimated 2,000 South African troops in Angola would
withdraw into South-West Africa by Sept. 1 in accordance with a
cease-fire agreement. South African units are as much as 180 miles
inside Angola.
   Military headquarters dismissed as ``ludicrous'' a London
newspaper report that several hundred of the soldiers had been
trapped behind enemy lines and faced death or capture prior to the
truce accord with Angola and Cuba.
   Officials of the three countries are to meet in two weeks to
negotiate a timetable for withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban
troops supporting Angola's Marxist government in a 13-year-old war
against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA.
   If agreement on Cuban withdrawal is reached, South Africa says
it will set Nov. 1 as the starting date for implementing a U.N.
plan to end its 73-year rule over South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   The U.N. plan envisions a 7,500-man U.N. peacekeeping force to
be deployed in Namibia for seven months while South African troops
gradually withdraw and elections are held for an assembly to draft
a post-independence constituion.
   Estimate of the cost of the U.N. operation have ranged as high
as $1 billion.
   If the implementation process begins Nov. 1, elections could
take place as early as June 1, 1989.
   Dirk Mudge, current chairman of Namibia's multiracial interim
Cabinet, said a constitution should be drafted before the elections.
   Mudge suggested Namibian guerrillas, known as the South-West
African People's Organization, should join with other Namibian
political parties in negotiating the framework of a constitution
prior to elections.
   Mudge, at a news conference Tuesday, said he detected no signs
of panic among white Namibians over the prospect of independence.
He attributed this to changes in the territory over the past
decade, including abolition of residential segregation and
installation of a government in which six of eight Cabinet
ministers are black.
   Moses Katjiuongua, minister of health and welfare, suggested
that elections be held in Angola as well as Namibia.
   ``Free and fair elections in Angola are long overdue,'' he said,
endorsing UNITA's argument that Angola's Marxist leaders have never
received an electoral mandate since Angola's independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   UNITA is not party to the cease-fire and says it will keep
fighting until power-sharing talks take place.
   In Namibia, most political experts believe the South-West
African People's Organization will win a nationwide election. It is
the largest independence movement and its guerrilla wing has been
fighting South African rule since 1966.
   South Africa's chief representative in Namibia, Louis Pienaar,
has urged moderates and conservatives to form a common front to
oppose the movement in the elections.

<HEAD>Appeals Of Four Instructors Rejected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Navy admiral has rejected the appeals
of four rescue instructors charged in the death of an airman who
was dragged into a swimming pool while classmates sang to drown out
his screams for help.
   The decision means the instructors have exhausted their appeals.
   The four had apealed the fines and reductions in rank they
received in June as non-judicial punishment in the death of Lee
Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.
   He died March 2 after being pulled from a training pool at the
Pensacola Naval Air Station's Rescue Swimmer School.
   Vice Adm. Ron Thunman, chief of naval education and training,
found the punishments appropriate, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   The instructors are Petty Officers David J. Smith, Richard
Blevins, Frankie Deaton and John Zelenock. They were charged with
conspiracy to commit battery. Two other Navy personnel are awaiting
courts-martial.
   A court-martial for Lt. Thomas Torchia, the school's former
officer-in-charge, was postponed three days until Aug. 25, said Lt.
Cmdr. Dennis Hessler.
   A fifth instructor, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, faces
court-martial Aug. 29 on charges of involuntary manslaughter,
conspiracy to commit battery and battery.
   Combe could receive more than three years in a military jail and
a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge. If convicted, Torchia
faces three months' confinement, loss of pay and a reprimand.
   The Navy has accused Combe of holding Mirecki's head under water
after other instructors had physically forced the recruit back into
the pool.
   Mirecki had been pushed back into the pool after he panicked,
climbed out and shouted that he was quitting the course. The
instructors ordered other recruits to turn their backs to the pool
and sing the national anthem.
   At an investigative hearing, a pathologist testified Mirecki
suffered heart failure followed by drowning.

<TEXT>
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ,''
a film that is enraging segments of the Christian community for its
reinterpretation of the Bible, is drawing mixed reviews as art on
the secular front.
   Included in the film is some nudity, Mary Magdalene plying her
trade as a prostitute, and the scene that has most outraged its
antagonists, in which the crucified Jesus hallucinates he marries
her and has sex with her.
   Film critics who viewed the R-rated movie in a Universal Studios
screening room Tuesday, including Michael Medved of ``Sneak
Previews,'' Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times and Bob
Thomas of The Associated Press, said they were unimpressed overall.
   ``It's the height of irony that this level of controversy could
be generated by a movie this awful,'' said Medved.
   ``An intellectual exercise of the `What if?' variety,'' Thomas
said. ``At times moving, often overwrought, and at least 40 minutes
too long.''
   Daily Variety raved about the film.
   ``A film of challenging ideas, and not salacious provocations,''
the industry paper's review said.
   And Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote in this week's
edition, ``Those willing to accompany (director Martin) Scorese on
his dangerous ride through the Gospels may believe he has created
his masterpiece.''
   Scorsese, who also directed ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull,''
defended the film Tuesday night on ABC-TV's ``Nightline.''
   Regarding the sex scenes, he said, ``It was important to show
him go through all the steps of an ordinary life, to be married, to
make love with his wife for the purposes of having children.''
   He denied any blasphemous intent.
   ``I'm a Catholic, raised Catholic,'' he said. ``We have a right
to explore God in our way.''
   As the critics watched, 150 protesters, none of whom had seen
the film, rallied on another part of the studio lot to castigate
Universal and its parent company, MCA Inc.
   At the climax of the protest orchestrated by the Rev. R.L.
Hymers Jr., a Baptist preacher, a mock crucifixion depicted a
bloodied Jesus screaming as a man portraying MCA Chairman Lew
Wasserman nailed him to a 10-foot cross.
   Wasserman, encountered later, would not acknowledge a reporter's
questions.
   Earlier protests have drawn charges of anti-Semitism. Other
Christian ministers denounced a march led by Hymers at a synagogue
where he thought Wasserman worshipped.
   There was no demonstration outside a New York screening.
   Regarding the protests, Scorsese said: ``I am not surprised at
people being shocked by the idea of it. Not everybody's going to
like it.'' But, he added, ``I'm surprised at the anti-Semitism
that's been brought around in the protesting.
   ``It's very important that people understand this film is not
based on the Gospels. It's based on a work of fiction.''
   Scorsese said he was bothered that the U.S. Roman Catholic
bishops have deemed the movie objectionable.
   ``It disturbs me I know but I do know the church has to protect
what they feel is its flock. I do know that the book (on which the
movie is based) is used in seminaries at times to open
discussions.''
   The U.S. Catholic Conference said Tuesday it is urging the
nation's 53 million Catholics not to see the film.
   The furor is likely to boost the movie's fortunes, said Harold
Vogel of Merrill Lynch Co., an entertainment industry analyst.
   Richard Hirsch, director of communications for the U.S. Catholic
Conference, acknowledged that dilemma, saying ``It's a case of
damned if you do and damned if you don't.''
   The film, which opens to the public Friday, depicts Jesus as
tempted to resist divinity, until the point of death on the cross.
   Protestant fundamentalists, notably the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a
United Methodist minister who heads the American Family Association
in Tupelo, Miss., and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, have been campaigning
against the movie. Their protests have escalated since Universal
rejected pleas to destroy the film.
   Universal responded by accusing protesters of censorship and
moving up the release date.
   Members of other churches, such as the Episcopal bishop of New
York, said after a preview they would not oppose the film's release.
   The $6.5 million movie is based on the 1955 novel of the same
name by Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis. It stars Willem Dafoe
(``Platoon'') as Jesus, Barbara Hershey (``Hannah and Her
Sisters'') as Mary Magdalene and rocker David Bowie as Pontius
Pilate.

   The American who made her choreographic debut
with the Broadway show ``Oh! Calcutta!'' plans to add abstract
dancing to the repertoire of China's national ballet company.
   ``Their repertoire at the moment is tried and true classics like
Swan Lake and Giselle,'' Margo Sappington told reporters today. ``I
can push them beyond what they're used to.''
   Miss Sappington, who has choreographed ballets for the Joffrey
Ballet, the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater and the Houston Ballet, is to
create a contemporary work for 15 to 20 members of the Central
Ballet of China, the nation's most prestigious dance group.
   She said her new 25-minute work for the Beijing troupe, to be
called ``Heliotrope,'' will be set to a violin concerto by Du
Mingxin, head of the composition department at the Beijing's
Central Conservatory of Music. It will premiere at the Tianqiao
Theater on Sept. 18.
   Li Chengxiang, director of the Central Ballet, said the work
will be performed three or four times in Beijing and then will
become part of the troupe's repertoire.
   Miss Sappington said she hopes ``this kind of abstract ballet
will bring in some new people, some young people.''
   The standards of the Chinese dancers are very high, she said,
and classical ballet will provide the base ``on which I hope to
embellish.''
   The Central Ballet was founded in 1959, but during the Cultural
Revolution of 1966-76, it was allowed to perform only revolutionary
works such as ``Red Detachment of Women.''
   Since then, the troupe has expanded its repertoire and won
international honors for its mastery of Western classical works. In
recent years, the company toured the United States, Britain and the
Soviet Union with a repertoire that includes Chinese and Western
classics as well as works from the Cultural Revolution.
   The dancers, like Chinese athletes, are recruited in elementary
school and trained in special schools.
   Other Western ballet figures such as Rudolf Nureyev, Beryl Grey
and Maria Fay have coached Chinese dancers, but Miss Sappington
says she will be the first to choreograph a ballet ``from scratch.''
   She said the Chinese are excited about the chance to improvise.
   ``I hope this creative experience will make a lasting
relationship for cultural exchange not only for me but also for
other Western choreographers and the Central Ballet,'' she said.
   Miss Sappington made her debut with ``Oh! Calcutta!'' the
Broadway musical that won notoriety for its nudity. She also has
worked with the Harkness Ballet, the Pennsylvania Ballet, the
Nederlands Dans Theatre, Aterballetto in Italy and the Milwaukee
Ballet.
   The Coca-Cola Co. is sponsoring her visit to China and her
project with the Central Ballet.

   The Postal Service should pay attention to the
little things that keep customers happy, says Postmaster General
Anthony M. Frank.
   ``Give an extra smile, open the door for the customer who comes
at one minute after five, and ask an employee, `What do you
think?''' Frank said Tuesday to about 1,500 delegates at the 85th
convention of the National League of Postmaters. The group
represents more than 22,000 postmasters nationwide.
   The Postal Service lost customers to private delivery businesses
because of service cutbacks imposed in February, Frank said. The
cutbacks and a rate hike in April did ``serious harm to the postal
service's public image,'' he said.
   Frank urged postmasters to improve employee relations and help
educate the public about the postal service by giving speeches and
conducting open houses.
   Retail services eliminated because of cutbacks are scheduled to
be restored Sept. 10.

<TEXT>
   A senior Iranian diplomat who will
participate in direct talks with Iraq said today lasting peace will
result only if Iraq is branded the aggressor in the 8-year-old war
and Iran receives compensation.
   Also today, Tehran Radio said Iraqi warplanes violated Iranian
airspace in the southwest. No bombing was reported. The official
Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, carried no reports of
fighting.
   Cyrus Nasseri, head of the Iranian mission to the United Nations
in Geneva, spoke at an international conference organized by Iran
to discuss ``aggression and defense.'' Direct peace talks between
Iran and Iraq are scheduled to begin Aug. 25.
   ``The talks in Geneva are going to be very difficult. Iran's
rights have to be preserved,'' he said, using Iran's shorthand for
its repeated demand that Iraq be identified as starting the war.
   Iran also wants ``compensation for aggression,'' he said. He did
not make any detailed reference to the claims. Official Iranian
assessments have put the cost of war damage at $350 billion.
   ``If there is a positive response from the international
community to this key issue then we can hope for lasting peace,''
he said.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border skirmishes.
   Nasseri said Iran decided on uly 18 to accept a U.N. cease-fire
resolution partly because the superpowers and other countries were
siding with Iraq and imposing a full political and economic embargo
on Iran.
   ``To avoid further loss of life and property, it was decided to
give another chance to reconciliation,'' he said.
   Nasseri said the West and countries around the Persian Gulf
rejected conciliatory approaches from Iran. He said the United
States wanted Iran in trouble ``because in the back of their minds
they thought this could resolve their problems, such as the hostage
crisis.''
   Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners believed held hostage in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian groups.
   Nasseri made repeated references to two schools of thought in
the Iranian leadership: those in favor of conciliation and those
who prefer a defiant stance.
   ``At every instance (in the past) one can see that Iran's intent
was to use a conciliatory approach but it was pushed into a
corner,'' he said. ``That left no alternative. We were forced on
the path of defiance.''
   Tehran Radio also said the Cabinet discussed post-war
reconstruction efforts today and reviewed implementing the
cease-fire accords after a briefing by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati. It did not elaborate.
   Velayati returned to Tehran today after spending three weeks
negotiating at the United Nations.
   Five members of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group
arrived today to supervise implementation of a cease-fire, the
official Islamic Republic news agency reported.
   The observers initially will work in the southern and western
areas of the country to monitor military movements until the
cease-fire starts officially on Aug. 20, IRNA said.
   The full contingent of 350 observers from 25 countries is
expected to be in place within a week, well before the scheduled
cease-fire date, according to U.N. officials.

   Rep. Pat Swindall met with the House ethics
committee investigating whether he violated the law or House rules,
and he gave the panel copies of tape recordings made during a
federal money laundering probe last year.
   Swindall met behind closed doors for nearly three hours Tuesday
with the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.
   The committee decided in June to conduct a preliminary
investigation to determine if Swindall violated the law or House
rules in pursuing an $850,000 home construction loan after being
told it likely would be financed with drug money he would be
helping to launder.
   Swindall said he gave the committee copies of tape recordings
made last year of conversations between Swindall and two men,
Charles LeChasney, who later was indicted on money laundering
charges, and Michael Mullaney, an Internal Revenue Service
undercover agent.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr in Atlanta refused earlier to provide
the committee with the tape recordings because he said the money
laundering investigation has not been completed. Swindall has not
been charged in connection with the federal probe.
   Swindall said that among other things, he also gave the
committee a copy of a constituent newsletter listing a ``summary of
facts'' about the case.
   ``All I am doing is turning over information that I promised to
turn over to the ethics committee so that they can look into my
request, which was that they consider all of the information,''
Swindall said.
   Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., and other committee
members refused to answer questions about the investigation or
about the meeting with Swindall.
   Swindall requested the ethics committee probe after The Atlanta
Journal and The Atlanta Constitution obtained copies of the tape
recordings and reported details of the loan negotiations.
   Swindall at one point accepted a $150,000 check from LeChasney,
but returned it uncashed several days later. The tapes show that he
broke off the negotiations after Mullaney told him he would have to
accept the loan proceeds in cash and sign a receipt for them.

   Bees that made their home in Trinity
Episcopal Cathedral's rafters for the last decade left a donation
before being evicted.
   At least 1,000 pounds of honey remain in the walls of the
church, said the Rev. John Fricke, senior pastor.
   ``It drips a little holy honey when it gets hot,'' Fricke said.
``It comes down a pillar support right onto the floor. We've put
aluminum foil around the pillar to make kind of a drip dish. It
tastes wonderful.''
   In July, the church hired Roger Miller of Miller Apiaries to
remove the bees and honeycombs so workers could safely paint the
windows and gutter frames.
   Miller said he vacuumed up about 15,000 bees and turned them
loose and exterminated the remaining 15,000 to 35,000 bees lodged
in wall cavities beyond his reach.
   ``I salvaged about 100 pounds of the honey from a two-inch
slot,'' Miller said. ``I'm going to bottle it and put these little
gold crosses on them. I'll give it back to the church, and we've
talked about selling it with a slogan like `Honey From on High.'''
   The church has not decided whether to sell the honey, said
Fricke. But any proceeds might go toward rebuilding Trinity's
50-year-old pipe organ.

<HEAD>Minister Resigns In India In Phone-Tapping Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief minister of an
opposition-governed southern state resigned today after he was held
responsible for tapping the telephones of journalists and rival
politicians, a news report said.
   Chief Minister Ramakrishna Hegde, the highest elected official
in Karnataka state, denied involvement in the bugging, but accepted
responsibility and said he was stepping down on moral grounds, the
United News of India reported.
   Hegde told a news conference in New Delhi he would submit a
formal letter of resignation to the state governor on Thursday, the
news agency said.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Tuesday accused Hegde, leader of
the opposition Janata Party in Karnataka, of violating laws and
invading the privacy of citizens.
   Gandhi made his comments in Parliament after the Times of India
newspaper said police were listening to the telephone conversations
of 51 politicians and journalists in Karnataka. Those affected
included state leaders of Gandhi's Congress Party, a newspaper
editor and members of Hegde's party.
   Hegde has been faced with mounting dissatisfaction in the Janata
Party but survived two votes of confidence in the state legislature
in recent months. Some of the dissent has been caused by the
upcoming merger of the Janata Party with three other opposition
groups, a move Hegde supports.
   Under the Indian Telegraph Act, tapping of telephone lines is
permitted only if criminal activity is suspected.
   ``The Karnataka government has violated rules under the act. We
will definitely look into it and, if need be, amend the rules to
see that such violations do not take place,'' Gandhi said Tuesday.
   He denied charges the federal government also had ordered the
bugging of telephone lines of opposition political leaders.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has cut off funding for a
study on the effectiveness of condoms in preventing the spread of
AIDS among homosexuals for fear of infecting study participants, it
was reported today.
   The Los Angeles Times said about $2.6 million was halted for the
study by the University of California at Los Angeles. Tests
involving people had not yet begun.
   The combination of high AIDS infection rates and the possibility
of condom failure prompted the cutoff, said Dr. Jeffrey Perlman,
chief of contraceptive evaluation for the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development.
   ``What has happened in the last two years is that gays in Los
Angeles became supersaturated with the virus so that to go ahead
with this study would mean that there is going to be a large
proportion of the recruits who would have become infected,'' said
Perlman, the grant's project officer. ``On that basis, it really
came to an ethical issue.''
   Dr. Roger Detels, the head of the UCLA study, refused to comment
on the cancellation of the project's funds.
   The money would have been used to study how effective condoms
are in stopping the spread of the AIDS virus during anal sex.
   Project workers already have spent $1 million in federal funds
on laboratory tests to determine the abilities of different kinds
and brands of condoms to inhibit AIDS transmission.

<HEAD>El Pasoans Think Secretive Yale Club Hides Pancho Villa's Skull</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skull referred to in Yale University's
secret Skull and Bones society belongs to Mexican revolutionary
Pancho Villa, a group of history buffs believes.
   A lawyer for the society, which Vice President George Bush
joined in his Yale days, says the story is unfounded.
   The group of about a dozen history and archaeology enthusiasts
has tried to persuade Villa's widow and the Mexican government to
sue to recover the skull and return it to Villa's grave in Mexico.
   Francisco ``Pancho'' Villa was the leader of the last military
invasion of the United States mainland when his forces raided
Columbus, N.M., in 1916. He was assassinated in 1923 and grave
robbers stole his skull in 1926.
   The El Paso group members, who discuss their interest over lunch
every Wednesday, began the quest for Villa's skull about 18 months
ago.
   They read the memoirs of Arizona native Ben Williams, who said a
Skull and Bones member told him the society had the skull, said
Alex Apostolides, curator of El Paso's Wilderness Museum and a
member of the group.
   Enidcott P. Davison, a Connecticut lawyer who says he speaks for
the secret Yale society, said it does not have Villa's skull.
   The El Paso group also wrote an appeal to Bush asking him to
persuade the club to surrender the skull if it has it. Bush's
office in Washington confirmed the letter had been received, but
said no reply had been written.
   Neither the Mexican government nor Villa's 92-year-old widow has
expressed interest in suing. The El Paso group cannot sue because
it has no standing in the case.

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed a couple's
lawsuit accusing Jim and Tammy Bakker of fraud and racketeering.
   The suit, filed in July 1987, accused the Bakkers and former PTL
Executive Director Richard Dortch of overselling $1,000
partnerships guaranteeing three free nights' lodging at PTL's
Heritage Grand Hotel each year for life.
   U.S. District Judge Robert D. Potter on Monday said that David
and Sarah Combs of West Virginia had no grounds to sue under the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and that
the suit was filed in the wrong state.
   Ryan Hovis, an attorney for Bakker, said the ruling averts a
possible class-action lawsuit in which about 55,000 lifetime
partners could have been eligible to collect damages.
   Two other suits are pending against the Bakkers, Hovis said. One
is another RICO lawsuit filed by a PTL partner and the other was
filed by PTL.
   Bakker left PTL in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal, and
the organization he built is mired in bankruptcy court with debts
estimated at $130 million.
   Bakker said he and his wife were ``absolutely elated'' by the
dismissal.
   ``It's just confirmation of what Tammy and I have said all
along: Once responsible people start reviewing these claims by
these people who are trying to hurt us, they'll know that we've
done nothing wrong,'' Bakker said.
   The Combses had charged that PTL sold more lifetime partnerships
than the hotel could accommodate and that they couldn't get a
reservation.

<TEXT>
   Ex-actor Ben Jones, who played a mechanic on the ``Dukes of
Hazzard,'' dismantled his opponents in a bid to face an embattled
Republican congressman in Georgia this fall, while a 44-year
Illinois incumbency ended by death was returned to Democratic hands.
   In other primaries Tuesday, Georgia voters picked a young
Democratic attorney to take on Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich, a
five-term congressman who has led efforts to force an investigation
of House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Colorado had primaries in six congressional districts, but only
one pitched battle. State Rep. David Bath defeated former Secretary
of State Mary Estill Buchanan, who lost to Gary Hart in the 1980
Senate race, in a race scarcely noticed by voters.
   Elsewhere, Ralph David Abernathy III, son of the civil rights
leader, decisively won the Democratic nomination for a state House
seat in Atlanta. Abernathy will meet Republican John E. Thompson in
the fall.
   Jones, 47, had been rated the Democratic favorite against Rep.
Pat Swindell in Georgia's 4th District race, both as a result of
his 1986 campaign effort and his role as the mechanic ``Cooter'' on
``The Dukes of Hazzard'' television show.
   ``They laughed at us when we got in the ring two years ago.
They're taking us seriously now,'' Jones told cheering supporters
at his headquarters Tuesday night.
   His opponents sought to counter that advantage by portraying
Jones as too liberal, attacking Jones after he told a college group
in May he would be willing to consider legalizing drugs.
   He acknowledged making the statement, but insisted that he also
told the group he would consider that as an option only after a
massive effort to eradicate drugs.
   With all 220 precincts reporting unofficial totals, Jones had
32,637 votes, or 62 percent; lawyer Nick Moraitakis, 10,832, or 21
percent; and theater executive John Stembler, 8,814, or 17 percent.
   Jones said Stembler's attempt to ``trash'' him played into
Swindall's hands. On the other hand, he praised Moraitakis for
taking a ``high road.''
   In southern Illinois, Democrat Jerry Costello won a special
election to fill the final 4{ months of the late Rep. Mel Price's
term, but Republicans say the race was close enough to merit their
continued attention in November.
   ``We're extremely encouraged by all this,'' said Kenny Klinge,
chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, despite the
narrow defeat of GOP candidate Robert Gaffner, a college
administrator.
   So was Costello, who expressed confidence about winning a full
two-year term in November.
   ``We're going to take the Republicans and the Republican
National Congressional Committee in the November election, too,''
he told supporters. ``We're going to grab them by the nose and kick
them in the feet and make them like it.''
   Costello, chairman of the St. Clair County Board and one of the
most powerful Democratic Party leaders in the region, won the race
with 33,247 votes, or 51.5 percent, to Gaffner's 31,279, or 48.5
percent, according to unofficial returns.
   Price, a Democrat, died in April after nearly 44 years in
Congress.
   In Georgia's 6th District race to oppose Gingrich, unofficial
returns from 211 of 218 precincts showed David Worley, a
30-year-old attorney, with 32,134 votes or 56 percent to
businessman Clyde Owens' 25,411, or 44 percent. Worley had the
backing of Georgia House Speaker Tom Murphy.
   Worley focused more on Gingrich than on his Democratic rival
during the primary campaign, saying at one point that Gingrich's
five terms in Congress represented ``10 years of double-talking,
double-dealing and deceit.''
   Gingrich accused Worley of running a ``remarkably negative and
inaccurate campaign'' and said he would debate the challenger in
every county of the district.
   In all, eight of Georgia's 10 congressmen won renomination
without opposition in the primary election. Both of those opposed
were victorious.

   Federal agents seized records of a West
Virginia defense contractor in an investigation into allegedly
defective life rafts sold to the Navy, a newspaper reported today.
   The Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the FBI on Monday
raided Rubber Crafters Inc., a Grantsville, W.Va., company that
received $17.3 million to produce a 25-man lifeboat from 1984 to
1987, The Pittsburgh Press said.
   ``Voluminous amounts of records were seized,'' U.S. Attorney
William Kolibash said. ``The next step is to see what's in the
records and what action to take.''
   An affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Wheeling, W.Va.,
quoted unidentified employees of Rubber Crafters as saying that
rafts were constructed of inferior material and shipped to Navy
supply centers in Norfolk, Va., and Oakland, Calif., and that
records were falsified and tests rigged to conceal the defects.
   ``We have no comments,'' said a woman who answered the phone at
Rubber Crafters today. She refused to identify herself.
   Kolibash said the investigation is not related to the
wide-ranging probe of alleged bribery in the awarding of military
contracts.

<DATELINE>BOLZANO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Nazi concentration camp guard
arrested in northern Italy was deported today to West Germany,
police said.
   Officials in West Germany said Anton Maloth, 76, could be freed
when he arrives in Munich because no criminal charges are pending
against him.
   Maloth was sentenced to death in Czechoslovakia in 1948 for war
crimes, but Italy and Czechoslovakia have no extradition treaty.
West German citizens cannot by law be extradited to a foreign
country.
   A police official in Bolzano, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Maloth left Verona this afternoon on a plane bound
for Munich.
   The official said Maloth held an expired West German passport,
which was why he was being sent to that country. He said Maloth had
been expelled to West Germany from Italy twice before, in 1965 and
1972.
   Czechoslovakia submitted an extradition request Tuesday. But
even if the two countries had an extradition treaty, Italian law
forbids extraditing someone facing the death penalty because Italy
has no capital punishment.
   Maloth was arrested last week at his wife's home in Merano.
   Vienna-based Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said Maloth had been
hiding with his family in Italy for 15 years. Maloth was a member
of the Nazi SS and a guard at the Theresienstadt concentration camp
in wartime Czechoslovakia.
   In West Germany, the Foreign Ministry today confirmed that
Maloth was being deported and would arrive in Munich today.
   A ministry spokesman, Peter Rothen, said in Bonn that he did not
know whether Maloth would be taken into custody in Munich.
   ``We have determined that he is a German citizen, and therefore
under the constitution cannot be extradited,'' Rothen said.
   Klaus Schacht, a West German prosecutor in charge of the Maloth
case, said investigators intend to question Maloth. ``When Maloth
comes to Munich, I will have the border police ask him where he
intends to settle in West Germany, and then we will question him,''
Schacht said.
   ``So far, there are no criminal charges against him,'' the
prosecutor said.

<HEAD>Stop-and-Question Policy Prompts Civil Rights Complaints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights groups are condemning a new
Police Department policy of stopping and questioning groups of
black teen-agers in the city's Old West End in an attempt to curb
racial violence there.
   Police Chief Marti Felker, in a July 8 letter to leaders of the
Old West End Association, said he has instructed a deputy chief to
``pay special attention to groups of black juveniles'' in the
racially mixed neighborhood.
   ``Officers are to stop and identify these youths so that in the
event an occurrence does take place, investigators will have the
names of the juveniles to work on,'' Felker said.
   The order resulted from complaints by Old West End residents,
who reported thrree instances of violence involving black youths.
   Felker on Tuesday defended his action, saying it was used two
years ago to stop whites from harassing blacks on the city's south
end.
   But LeRoy Williams, president of the Toledo chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said
while police watched white teen-agers in 1986, they never stopped
them.
   He added that his organization will try to set up a meeting with
Felker to discuss the policy.
   ``Certainly police need to be vigilant, but stopping black
youths because they are congregating in the area of town and not
stopping youths congregating in other areas of town is
unconstitutional,'' he said.
   Harland Britz, general counsel of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the policy violates constitutional protections against
illegal search and seizure.
   ``I don't think police have the right to stop any youths just
because they are standing around. That sounds very questionable to
me,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bentsen's Son, Daughter-in-law Said To Have $12.6 Million in Debts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A son of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice
presidential candidate, and his estranged wife have $12.6 million
in debts on their community property, according to court records in
the couple's divorce case.
   Lan C. Bentsen on Tuesday asked a judge to seal the file
involving his divorce from his wife, Lynne, The Houston Post
reported today. Bentsen said it had ``nothing'' to do with his
father being chosen as the running mate to Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis.
   He declined further comment, saying ``it's a personal matter.''
His attorney said any publicity about the case could harm the
couple's 8-year-old daughter, Skyler.
   Bentsen, 40, was sued for divorce last August by his wife, who
claims the 10-year-old marriage is insupportable due to marital
discord.
   Both allege each has spent thousands of dollars of joint funds
in violation of a routine temporary divorce court order issued in
September 1987.
   Financial documents filed in the case indicate the couple's
community property, which includes Lan Bentsen's various real
estate interests, is $12.6 million in debt, the Post said. The
couple has about $4.5 million in assets and $17.2 million in
liabilities, according to documents.
   State District Judge John Montgomery granted the request to seal
the file, but said he would consider requests from organizations or
individuals that wished to see it. The Post was permitted to view
the documents.
   The divorce case is set for trial in February.
   Lan Bentsen, at one time president of Bath-Bentsen Interests,
was elected chairman of the board of Security National Bank in
1977. He has been doing campaigning for his father's Senate
re-election bid, which is being conducted along with Bentsen's
campaign with Dukakis for the White House.

   Soviet missile experts today completed
their inspections of U.S. cruise missiles at two sites in Belgium
under the new treaty to eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons, a
U.S. spokesman said.
   U.S. Army Capt. John Driggers said a team of 10 Soviet
inspectors wound up their work at 8 a.m. at Florennes Air Base, 40
miles south of Brussels.
   A second group of 10 experts finished their missile checks an
hour later at the European Repair Facility at Gosselies, 10 miles
north of Florennes.
   The two teams began their tasks on Tuesday under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which gives the Soviet
Union and the United States an unprecedented opportunity to inspect
each other's facilities.
   The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the United States and five
Western European countries. U.S. experts are inspecting 133 sites
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   Each inspection can last up to 24 hours, with a possible
eight-hour extension.
   Driggers said the Soviet teams and their American escorts would
write up, as required, reports on the inspections before returning
to Brussels in the afternoon.
   He said it was not yet known when the missile experts would
leave for Moscow. They arrived on Monday and officially notified
authorities Tuesday morning that they wanted to inspect the two
sites.
   It was expected they would leave Brussels later today or
Thursday.
   Sixteen ground-launched cruise missiles and four spares are kept
at the Florennes base along with four launchers and eight spares,
according to U.S. officials. The base houses the 485th U.S.
Tactical Missile Wing.
   The sleek, ground-hugging weapons arrived in March 1985.
   There was no indication how many unarmed cruise missiles are
currently at the repair facility, which is run by the Belgian
defense contractor Sabca. On June 21, there were 55 missiles at the
plant, according to U.S. officials.
   The operation is the only one of its kind in Europe set up to
maintain and repair the weapons.
   Soviet teams earlier visited missile sites in Germany, Britain
and the Netherlands as part of the 60-day inspection process that
began July 1. They have not yet gone to sites in Italy.
   The treaty provides for elimination within three years of all
U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400
miles. It was signed in December in Washington by President Reagan
and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Councilman Won't Hire Consultants Whose Memos Castigated Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayoral challenger Zev Yaroslavsky has
disavowed memos from campaign consultants disparaging Mayor Tom
Bradley's intelligence.
   ``They are not my consultants nor are they any longer under
consideration,'' the city councilman said. ``I do not agree with
many of their ideas and I find many of their statements to be
insulting, insensitive and not reflective of my views.''
   The memos published in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times came from the
consulting firm BAD.
   ``The reason why BAD thinks you can beat Bradley is: You've got
50 IQ points on him (and that's no compliment.) But your IQ
advantage is of no electoral advantage if you don't use it,'' the
consultants wrote.
   The consultants also predicted Bradley ``will excite black
voters to outvote the white electorate especially if there is a
runoff where his mayoral office is seen as jeopardized by a
perfidious Jew.''
   Bradley is black and Yaroslavsky Jewish.
   Bradley said of the memos, ``The background quality by which
they propose to start the campaign is so offensive.''
   Yaroslavsky aide Ann Hollister said the memos were stolen her
office. The newspaper said the documents were delivered anonymously
to a reporter.
   Yaroslavsky, who plans to challenge Bradley in the non-partisan
mayoral primary in April, said he did not ask for the memos.
   ``I have a very high personal regard for Tom Bradley,'' he said
Tuesday. ``I would not in any way countenance demeaning his
personal stature, his intelligence or his commitment to what he
thinks is right.''

<TEXT>
   Robert Chambers asked a court today to enter a
$25 million judgment against him on behalf of the parents of
Jennifer Levin, the young woman he strangled in Central Park in the
``preppie murder'' case two years ago.
   The request was filed in state Supreme Court by his attorney,
Brian O'Dwyer, who said in court papers that he had advised
Chambers against the move.
   In a handwritten note to the court, the 21-year-old Chambers
said: ``I elect not to contest the action for damages brought
against me by the Levins.
   ``My only wish is for the nightmare to end, for both families
and friends. I do not wish the Levins to endure any more pain,'' he
said.
   O'Dwyer said he explained to Chambers that all his property
could be attached and sold to satisfy the judgment, and that any
future salary, property, gift or inheritance he receives could be
attached as well.
   Chambers wrote the note at Great Meadows state prison in
Comstock, N.Y., where he is serving a five-to-15 year sentence. He
pleaded guilty in March to manslaughter while the jury was
deliberating murder charges.
   Steven and Ellen Levin, Miss Levin's parents, filed a wrongful
death suit against Chambers on July 22.
   Despite his Upper East Side residence and prep school education,
Chambers is not wealthy. His mother is a nurse who made about
$70,000 last year, and his father is a clerk who earned less than
$40,000.
   A court recently ordered Chambers' mother to pay more than
$15,000 in back rent.
   O'Dwyer said in the court papers that his client has applied to
Skidmore College to take courses in the fall. Chambers hopes to
become a teacher when he gets out of prison, the lawyer reported.
   Bob Kimmerle, a Skidmore spokesman, said O'Dwyer apparently was
referring to a program under which inmates can earn a bachelor's
degree in prison.
   On Monday, Miss Levin's parents filed a similar suit against the
owner of the bar where Miss Levin and Chambers were drinking hours
before he strangled the 18-year-old woman.
   Chambers had claimed during the trial he killed her accidentally
during rough sex.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter and
two of his sons will be honored by the government for climbing
Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, a government-owned
paper said today.
   The 64-year-old Carter, leading a 17-member party through snow
flurries and near-zero visibility, reached the volcanic mountain's
second highest peak, Gilman's Point, early Monday after a three-day
climb.
   Reaching Gilman's Point at 18,640 feet traditionally is
considered a successful climb, although the 19,340-foot Uhuru Peak
farther around the summit's crater is the mountain's highest point.
   Eight people who began the climb dropped out, including Rosalynn
Carter and three of the Carters' grandchildren. Mrs. Carter climbed
to 17,500 feet, while grandchildren, Jason, 13, James Early, 12,
and Sarah, 10, reached 17,000 feet.
   The party started down the mountain Monday and arrived at the
northern Tanzania town of Moshi late Tuesday.
   The group left today for four days of viewing wildlife in
Tangire, Manyara, Serengeti and the Ngorongoro Crater national
parks.
   President Ali Hassan Mwinyi will present certificates to Carter
and his sons, Jack, 41, and Jim ``Chip'', 38, at a ceremony marking
the climb Sunday in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's capial, according to
the government-owned Daily News.
   Carter and his party leave Dar es Salaam on Sunday for
neighboring Kenya.

   Authorities confused the identities of two
girls involved in a car crash, and parents ended life support for
the wrong teen-ager.
   The error was discovered Sunday by a friend during a viewing at
a funeral home. Both sets of parents had spent time with the bodies
and not realized the mistake.
   Wendy Liby, 18, was killed Friday night when a pickup truck
struck the car in which she and Kristine Bailer, 17, were riding.
Miss Bailer suffered massive head injuries in the accident.
   Miss Bailer, 17, was removed from life-sustaining machinery
Saturday with the permission of Miss Liby's parents, who thought
the girl was their daughter.
   ``I don't blame the other family,'' Miss Bailer's father, Ralph
Bailer, said Tuesday. ``I talked to Jerry (Liby), the father,
Sunday night and he was really tore up. He said he'd never have
done it if he'd known. He thought it was his daughter.
   ``Maybe I would have done the same. But even if I would have,
I'd have preferred that it was my decision,'' Bailer said.
   Each girl's family was shown a body and told it was their
daughter, said Deputy Coroner Gayle Armes.
   ``Members of the family are not good identifiers. They are too
emotional,'' said Allen County Coroner Dr. Phillip E.
O'Shaughnessy. ``It's not as easy as you think it may be,

   The U.S. Navy is investigating
allegations that a Navy ship refused to rescue some Vietnamese boat
people who later resorted to murder and cannibalism to survive at
sea, officials said today.
   Navy officials said the sailors reported giving food and water
to the boat people, not considering them to be in dire straits.
   ``We've made all information available to the United States, and
we know they are conducting an investigation and are very serious
about it,'' said Robert Cooper, local representative of the U.N.
High Commission on Refugees. Cooper said in a telephone interview
that the probe began last month.
   He said the 52 refugees who survived the 37-day ordeal charged
that crewmen of the USS Dubuque refused to take them aboard, even
though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure and
starvation.
   Cooper said the refugees reported that 58 people died during the
South China Sea crossing, which began May 22 when the group left
the Mekong Delta town of Ben Tre aboard a 35-foot wooden boat.
   Its engine failed two or three days later.
   By the June 9 encounter with the Dubuque, according to the
refugees, ``there was one dead refugee aboard, the motor was not
working, they were drifting for 19 days, people had died of
exposure, hunger and thirst,'' Cooper said.
   The refugees claimed to have later killed some of their
companions and eaten their flesh to survive. Cooper said the
``great majority'' of other deaths also occurred after the
encounter with the Dubuque.
   Officials at Subic Bay Naval Base, northwest of Manila, and at
the U.S. Navy's Surface Force Pacific Fleet office in San Diego,
Calif., confirmed that an investigation was under way.
   They said the Dubuque's commander reported that the refugee boat
was seaworthy and that they left the Vietnamese after giving them
more than 400 pounds of food, 50 gallons of water, navigational
charts and sailing directions.
   A Navy spokesman, Cmdr. David Dillon in San Diego, said he did
not think the crew would have turned the refugees away if their
boat was disabled.
   The Manila Chronicle quoted some of the refugees as saying the
crew told them the Dubuque was on a ``dangerous mission'' and could
not take them aboard.
   Dillon said the Dubuque was headed for the Persian Gulf, but
that its destination would not have been an excuse not to rescue
the Vietnamese if their boat was in distress.
   ``It's not a (Navy) policy not to allow refugees on board,'' he
said. ``It's a policy to render humanitarian assistance whenever
needed and however possible. In this case, the commanding officer
judged their craft to be seaworthy.''
   Dillon said Navy policy directs ships to be alert for refugees
on the high seas and assist them as needed. The policy calls for
ships to pick up refugees if their boat is disabled or in case of
bad weather.
   Filipino fishermen rescued the Vietnamese off northern Luzon
island on June 27. They were taken to a refugee camp housing more
than 4,000 other Vietnamese refugees on Palawan island.
   Cooper said investigators had not determined how many people the
refugees killed.
   ``Some said more (than three) were killed, some said less than
three,'' he said.
   Cooper said the alleged mastermind of the cannibalism was in
protective custody to prevent other refugees from harming him.
   The Manila Chronicle identified the first alleged victim as a
30-year-old man named Dao Coung, who wept and pleaded to be spared.
   ``Why not wait until I starve to death?'' Coung reportedly said
before two men grabbed him by the feet and submerged his head in
the sea until he was dead, the paper reported.
   Cooper said that if the allegations against the Navy crew prove
true, it would be the first time the U.S. Navy has failed to
adequately help a group of boat people since they began fleeing
after the fall of South Vietnam to the communists in 1975.

<HEAD>Congressional Negotiators Agree to Prohibit Drilling Off Northern
California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators have agreed to a
year's prohibition on oil and gas drilling off the northern coast
of California, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said today.
   Panetta said the action came Tuesday as a joint conference
committee continued to negotiate differences in the fiscal 1989
Interior Department appropriations bills passed by the two chambers.
   The language would bar any sales of offshore petroleum leases in
Area 91 through Oct. 1, 1989, as well as prohibit any test drilling
in the area, according to Panetta.
   He said the renewed ban would represent the end of eight years
of tussling over the northern California waters with Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel and his predecessor, James Watt.
   ``We can finally declare victory over the Watt-Hodel effort to
put our coast up for sale,'' Panetta said. ``As hard as this
administration tried, it failed in its attempt to allow oil and gas
drilling up and down the California coast.
   ``Now the focus turns to the upcoming election,'' he said. ``The
next president will determine the future of the California coast.
The candidates must tell us whether they are prepared to implement
a comprehensive national energy policy that emphasizes good
stewardship of our natural resources and preserves the most
sensitive areas of our coastline.''

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
called for renewed Nicaraguan peace talks after meeting with
President Oscar Arias, who said he thinks Washington is more
interested than ever in a diplomatic solution.
   Shultz is on a mission to involve the United States more closely
in the year-old Central American peace initiative, which Arias
authored.
   After meeting with the Costa Rican leader, he flew to
Tegucigalpa for talks with Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo and
later to El Salvador for a visit with acting President Rodolfo
Castillo Claramount. He flies home Thursday.
   Shultz left Costa Rica at 8:19 a.m. (10:19 a.m. EDT) on a
four-hour flight to Ecuador, the last stop of his Latin American
tour, to attend the inauguration of President-elect Rodrigo Borja.
   Shultz said today that other Central American governments view
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government as ``way out of step with
everybody else.''
   ``From the standpoint of the people of Nicaragua, their
government is a complete failure,'' he said on NBC-TV's ``Today''
show. ``Around them is freedom, there is democracy asserting itself
more and more.''
   The visit to Quito gives Shultz a further opportunity to talk
with Latin and Central American leaders. Among those attending the
inauguration are presidents Fidel Castro of Cuba and Daniel Ortega
of Nicaragua.
   Shultz is scheduled to meet privately with the new president, in
addition to President Virgilio Barco of Colombia, but he ruled out
meeting with Ortega or Castro.
   Castro ``doesn't deserve it,'' he told NBC. ``He hasn't done
anything for his people. And he is part of the problem here in
Central America.''
   On Tuesday, Shultz said the U.S.-backed Contra rebels are ready
to return to peace negotiations with Nicaragua, but not in Managua,
the capital.
   The most recent round of talks broke off June 9.
   ``I hope there will be another round of negotiations, not in
Managua but in another country ... like for example, Costa Rica,''
he told reporters after meeting Arias.
   The Contras insisted on another, more neutral, location before
the last round of talks but then agreed to return to Managua.
   The talks are aimed at establishing a permanent cease-fire in
the nearly 7-year-old war. A temporary truce took effect March 21
and has been extended several times by the Sandinistas, who accuse
the Contras of numerous cease-fire violations.
   Arias himself left for Quito shortly after meeting with Shultz
and told reporters at the airport, ``Washington is attaching more
importance to Central American problems.''
   ``I believe Washington is convinced _ now more than ever _ that
it is worthwhile to attempt peace through dialogue and
negotiation,'' the Costa Rican president added. Arias has long been
critical of U.S. support for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   It was Arias who conceived the regional peace plan that was
signed Aug. 7, 1987 by himself and the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. The effort brought him last
year's Nobel Peace Prize, but peace remains a distant hope in the
region.
   Arias said his discussion with Shultz involved nothing new.
   ``Mainly, I was informed of his visit to some of the South
American countries, and I told him my impression of events in
recent days,'' Arias said. ``But really, I've heard nothing new,
because between the last time I saw him and now, nothing special
has really happened.''
   They last met in June.
   Arias noted that he recently wrote Ortega asking the Nicaraguan
president to reopen closed news media, release about 40 people
arrested at a recent anti-government demonstration and renew
negotiations with the Contras. He offered Costa Rica as a site for
new talks.
   Shultz's 10-day, nine-nation visit to Latin America is his third
in a little more than a month. He began with a stop in Guatemala
City for a meeting with the foreign ministers of Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
   On Monday, a bomb damaged three cars of Shultz's motorcade in
Bolivia but caused no injuries.
   ``That incident only underlined what we're fighting for and
against,'' Shultz told NBC. ``We're fighting for decency and
democracy and freedom. And those who are against those things are
willing to use violent tactics against us. That should only
underscore our resolve.''

<HEAD>Mayor Denies Report He Offered Deal to Rowan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry says
there's no truth to a published report that an aide offered
columnist Carl Rowan lenient treatment in his shooting of a
trespassing teen-ager if Rowan promised to stop criticizing Barry's
administration.
   ``Neither I nor Mr. (Herbert O.) Reid would ever interfere with
or attempt to influence prosecutorial decisions by the corporation
counsel to prosecute the Rowan case,'' Barry said in a statement
Tuesday.
   The Legal Times newspaper on Monday quoted two sources it did
not identify as saying Reid, the mayor's counsel and confidant, had
tried to make a deal through the columnist's son, Carl Rowan Jr.
   Rowan's son on Tuesday said he was prepared to testify that
Barry and Reid had hinted in separate telephone conversations that
city officials would give his father such treatment if the
journalist would write columns more favorable to the city.
   Barry called the younger Rowan's statement ``a distortion of the
truth.''
   Rowan, a syndicated columnist, is scheduled to go to trial Sept.
22 on a charge of using an unregistered handgun and unregistered
ammunition to shoot Benjamin Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., on
June 14. The columnist had discovered the youth and at least one
companion taking a late-night dip in Rowan's backyard pool. Rowan
told police he shot Smith in the hand because he thought the teen
was lunging for him.
   If found guilty of both charges, Rowan could be sentenced to two
years in jail and a $2,000 fine.
   Barry said in his statement , ``It's idiocy to even suggest that
anybody in my administration would want to trade leniency for Mr.
Rowan for a positive column.''
   Reid charged that the Rowan family was trying to divert
attention from the charges.
   ``It's a discretionary tactic and it's successful,'' Reid told
The Washington Post. ``They were able to divert the attention from
whether or not he had a gun to how the city's being run and whether
there's corruption in the district.''
   Rowan, in a July 1987 column, criticized the district government
for accusing U.S. attorneys of racism whenever they pursued charges
against corrupt black officials.
   ``Enough members of the administration of Mayor Marion Barry
have pleaded guilty and gone to jail to make it clear that
corruption exists,'' Rowan wrote.

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell joined about 200
protesters today at the latest in a series of anti-abortion
demonstrations at a clinic here, and police arrested more than 40
people for blocking the entrances.
   The founder of the Moral Majority said he would use his TV
ministry and his pulpit at his Virginia church to encourage such
protests. ``We can break the back of the abortion industry and stop
the holocaust,'' he said.
   Police today began arresting demonstrators who ignored their
order to stop blocking the entrances to the Feminist Women's Health
Center.
   By 10:45 a.m., more than 40 had been arrested.
   During earlier protests over the past three weeks, 276 people
were arrested. Dozens remain in jail because they refuse to give
their names.
   Police and clinic workers today helped carry a patient into the
clinic after she was blocked by protesters sitting at the entrance.
The patient shouted at the protesters, ``Leave me alone.''
   Falwell said he came to Atlanta to endorse the strategy of the
group, Operation Rescue, and to bring a $10,000 check to pay for
the bail of Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry, who was arrested
during a protest last week.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
today that the Reagan administration will have to reconsider its
opposition to a Democratic-sponsored Contra aid plan if a rival
Republican package fails.
   Fitzwater told reporters the administration still hopes that a
rival measure sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole will be
enacted, ``but if not, and something else happens, we'll go to
`Plan B' '' _ the bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Robert
C. Byrd.
   The spokesman said that if the administration is forced to
reassess its opposition to the Byrd bill, ``that'll be a hard
decision.''
   ``We have a lot of problems with the Byrd bill, a lot of
reservations about it. We don't like it. It doesn't do the job. ...
`Plan B' at the moment is to consider the Byrd bill.''
   The Byrd plan would provide the Contras with $21.1 million in
non-lethal ``humanitarian'' assistance beginning Oct. 1 to sustain
them through next March. This would include $10 million for
relocating Contra soldiers into Nicaraguan society, a feature hotly
protested by some conservatives.
   It also sets up possible House and Senate votes this fall on
releasing $16.3 million in already approved military aid from
warehouses in Central America if President Reagan certifies that
Nicaragua's government has disrupted peace efforts.
   An alternative proposed by Dole, R-Kan., includes the $21.1
million in non-lethal aid, provides for the release of the $16.3
million in warehoused military supplies and adds $20 million in new
arms assistance. Dole is being urged to drop that proposal and
support the Byrd plan.
   The administration has said it believes the Byrd bill provides
inadequate mechanisms to get aid delivered to the Contras.
   Fitzwater's latest statements came a day after Democratic and
Republican senators appeared close to a grudging agreement on a new
U.S. aid plan for the resistance fighters, although they accused
each other of seeking political advantage.
   After days of inconclusive negotiations, some Republican
senators said many of their number appeared ready to accept the
Democratic-drafted compromise Contra aid plan. That package holds
out the possibility of releasing stockpiled arms to the rebels
opposing Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   If agreement is reached, it will be because a majority of
Republicans realized that the alternative may be no aid at all,
these senators said.
   ``I go home with high hopes,'' Byrd, D-W.Va., said Tuesday at
the end of another long day of repeated conferences on and off the
Senate floor.
   But he added: ``Time is running out. The sands in the hour glass
are falling, one by one.''
   Byrd made clear that if there is to be a unified Senate position
on Contra aid, including the possibility of renewing some military
assistance, the concessions will have to be made by the GOP.
   ``On my side of the aisle, it's a fragile coalition and I'm not
going to tamper with it,'' Byrd said. ``There's just no more give
on this side. Our coalition would just fall apart.''
   Several key Republican senators, most of them moderates, urged
that a compromise be reached, saying the alternative might be no
Contra aid of any kind.
   The Democratic plan would provide immediate humanitarian
assistance but would not provide military aid unless both House and
Senate approved a subsequent request from President Reagan.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., appealing to his colleagues to rally
behind a single, unified package that would be sponsored by both
Byrd and Dole, told the Senate: ``It's far more important than any
political consideration that if, even in this election year, we can
speak with one voice'' to Nicaragua's Marxist Sandinista rulers.
   ``We're so close,'' Rudman said. ``It's almost at the point
where we ought to join together. ... It would take only a small
concession from the majority and minority leaders to do it.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla, a strong Contra-aid supporter, accused
Republicans of playing politics with the issue and said the
reluctance of GOP senators to embrace the Democratic aid package is
``a real test of their sincerity.''
   ``If they really want aid to the Contras, I don't see how in the
world they can turn their backs on this proposal,'' Boren said,
adding that it represents the only way to get aid to the Contras
through Congress without a filibuster by aid opponents.
   Contra aid has become more sensitive for Democrats as the
campaign for the presidency unfolds.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis opposes Contra
aid. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas., his vice presidential running
mate, has voted for it.
   Some Democrats say their GOP counterparts want a clear
up-or-down Senate vote to dramatize that difference and embarrass
Dukakis.
   Some Republicans see Byrd's Contra aid proposal as a means to
provide political ``cover'' on the issue, insulating Dukakis and
Bentsen.
   But some disagreed that politics is a central element.
   ``It's not giving Dukakis and Bentsen cover ... or to give our
side cover,'' Dole said. ``We're trying to help the Contras.''

<HEAD>Pilot in 1985 Hijacking Says Hamadi Could Be Telling Truth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The pilot of a TWA jet airliner hijacked in
1985 said today the admitted hijacker of the plane could be telling
the truth when he testified that he didn't kill a U.S. Navy diver.
   ``It's possible that he didn't pull the trigger, but he and his
partner were certainly in full concert throughout that whole
ordeal,'' said pilot John Testrake in an interview on ``CBS This
Morning.'' West German law, like U.S. law, makes accomplices
responsible for a crime committed by the other.
   Testrake said he could not say whether Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who
testified in his trial in Frankfurt, West Germany, on Tuesday that
he had taken part in the hijacking, was the ringleader.
   ``I think that he was, but it's been three years now and I
recognize that memory plays tricks,'' said Testrake, who is to
testify in Hamadi's trial.
   ``I remember that he was the one who spoke German and seemed to
be in command of the situation in the cockpit at the time (diver
Robert Dean) Stethem was murdered, and he was conducting the radio
conversations with the tower and demanding that they comply with
their wishes,'' Testrake said.
   Hamadi testified that he pleaded with his partner not to kill
Stethem. Testrake was not asked about that part of Hamadi's
testimony.
   The pilot said the United States ``should shoulder a a good
share of blame for a lot of the conflict that's going on in the
Middle East.''
   But he said hijacking is a ``violent, desperate act that we have
to stop.'' He said tightened security has diminished the threat.
   Testrake said he would like to see Hamadi ``put away quietly for
a good long time until his attitude improves.'' But he said no
useful purpose would be served by putting him to death. Hamadi
faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted of Stethem's death.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on disclosing unpublished information:
   Every now and then some court plays variations on the pernicious
theme that reporters are obligated to help the police.
   This has happened again in California, where an appellate court
ruled that a reporter and photographer had a duty to disclose their
``unpublished information'' about an arrest they witnessed.
   Taken at face value, the judicial rationale may seem persuasive:
newspeople are as much obliged as anyone else to testify about what
they witnessed in public.
   But second thought suggests, as a Los Angeles Times lawyer
noted, that converting reporters into ``automatic witnesses'' would
seriously weaken their rightful posture of objectivity.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on Michael Dukakis and foreign
policy:
   Democrats are attempting to soft-pedal Michael Dukakis' lack of
foreign policy experience. They say he supports a strong defense.
   But former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, in an open
letter to Dukakis in Time magazine, questions whether the
Democratic nominee really is committed to a strong defense. ...
   The Reagan era has proven anew that the Soviets negotiate only
if faced with strength and resolve on matters of defense.
   Dukakis does not seem to have learned that yet, and this country
can't afford to give him on-the-job training.

   Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal on the health of presidential
candidates:
   The health of the candidates for president is of vital concern
to Americans.
   While the campaign itself appears to be a pretty good treadmill
test, most voters would like to make sure that physically and
psychologically, both Democrat (Michael) Dukakis and Republican
George Bush are well. ...
   Neither candidate has released all his medical records. And it's
hard to fault them for their reluctance.
   We have for voter approval two candidates who are in good
health. It appears they're both surely good for at least four
years' work and possibly eight.

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on the trade bill:
   After three years of struggle, Congress has passed the most
sweeping revision of U.S. trade law in decades.
   The bill started out dangerously protectionist, but President
Reagan and free-trade lawmakers got rid of the worst parts. ...
   Nevertheless, one should be wary of a 1,100-page piece of
congressional handiwork. Such monster bills traditionally are
studded with favors to special interests.
   The law had overwhelming support ... because it had something
for almost everybody. ...
   Perhaps we missed it, but we saw nothing there for consumers,
the group without a PAC (political action committee) and thus
without a loud voice in the corridors of power.
   The bill is notable for the damage it will not do: no major
tariff increases, new quotas or trade barriers.

   The Miami Herald on the next shuttle launch:
   The country needs a successful shuttle launch for two reasons.
   First, it would give a psychological boost to a nation
justifiably wary of the often-hollow promises of high technology.
   Second, there is a reason to believe that the advantages of
sophisticated manned flights into space will have long-term
benefits.
   But at the same time, NASA and its congressional-oversight
committees soon should re-examine the downgrading of refining
unmanned cargo-carrying flights.
   In order to promote the shuttle program, NASA has forsaken the
lead in a lucrative future market that requires, in relative terms,
a minimal investment.
   It would be wiser to split the priorities and the money on both
missions.

   The Baltimore Sun on Judge Hasting's impeachment:
   The House vote to impeach U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings
represents a first. It is the first time a federal official has
been impeached after a jury acquitted him of similar charges.
   Judge Hastings ... was accused in 1981 of conspiring with a
Washington attorney to solicit a bribe in a racketeering case. He
was acquitted ... but two judges ... pursued the case by filing a
misconduct charge against him.
   That led to a recommendation of impeachment by the Judicial
Conference of the United States and the congressional inquiry.
   The fact that Judge Hastings was pursued ... vigorously raises
suspicions about another first the judge represents. He was the
first black federal judge in Florida, ... and now becomes the first
black judge impeached.
   At a time when some blacks believe black elected officials are
targeted for special harassment, the proceedings against Judge
Hastings might raise troubling questions.
   But blacks in the House didn't seem to think racism was
involved. The House approved a 17-count resolution to impeach,
which is tantamount to an indictment that the Senate must now act
on, by a near-unanimous 413-3 vote.

   The Rapid City (S.D.) Journal on Dukakis health rumors:
   The mental and physical well-being of a presidential candidate
is a matter of legitimate public concern.
   But the recent episode of the rumored mental problems of
Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis was mean and petty. ...
   The rumors apparently first surfaced in the form of handbills
slipped under reporters' hotel room doors at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta.
   The handbills were signed by the ``National Democratic Policy
Committee,'' an arm of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. ...
   The Democrats need not be surprised. They are trying hard to
paint Vice President George Bush as a wimp. ...
   If they take delight in that kind of character assault, it
should not surprise them when the opposition returns the favor. ...
   If someone has proof that Dukakis is unfit _ let's see it. And
if anybody has evidence that Bush is a weakling _ let's see it.
   Until then, those issues are not worth considering.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on pending legislation calling for
a seven-day waiting period for handgun sales:
   Polls show that more than 90 percent of the American people
favor a waiting period in the purchase of handguns.
   Even President Reagan, whose anti-gun control credentials are
impeccable, recently announced his support of a waiting period.
   But the National Rifle Association, which automatically opposes
even the mildest of gun regulations as an assault on the
constitutional right to bear arms, is predictably fighting this
amendment as well. And the NRA still has considerable clout in
Washington.
   Twenty years ago, in the aftermath of a series of political
assassinations in this country, Congress passed a law prohibiting
felons, minors, illegal aliens, drug addicts and those adjudicated
mentally ill from acquiring handguns.
   In states where there is a legal waiting period, hundreds of
such persons are stopped from buying guns every year. ...
   Clearly a national law is needed.

   The Des Moines (Iowa) Register on the need for a rural policy:
   Rural America is in trouble, and farming alone will not save it.
...
   Increasingly, ``farm'' and ``rural'' are not one in the same.
Having a good farm policy is not the same as having a rural policy.
   Rural America is not farms alone. It is people who live in the
country but who don't farm for a living. ...
   The gap between rural and metropolitan America is widening. Much
of rural America is dying of an empty heart. ...
   People must stop equating farm policy and rural policy.
Politicians must stop trying to solve rural problems with farm
programs. ...
   In recognition of the new thinking, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture should be reorganized, refocused and reconstituted as a
Department of Rural Affairs.
   It should be Cabinet level and explicitly dedicated to the
well-being of all 63 million rural Americans, not just the 5
million who live on farms.
   It should concentrate less on commodities and more on people and
communities.

   Bridgeton (N.J.) Evening News on the Republican convention:

   This political season the big things for both parties, because
indications are that it will be a close election, are the black
vote, the women's vote and the labor vote.
   The Republicans haven't counteracted the (Jesse) Jackson
phenomenon yet but will come up with something.
   They have offered a similar day care proposal to that of the
Democrats and the president has agreed to let the labor bill
proposed by the Democrats pass unchallenged to get labor's support.
   The Republicans could have a strong issue if their public
relations people can get the voters excited about it, which is
doubtful.
   But don't expect miracles from the convention.

   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on the release of
Mathias Rust:
   The improbable odyssey of Mathias Rust ended (Aug. 3) when the
20-year-old pilot was expelled from the Soviet Union.
   Rust stunned the world in May 1987 when he flew a rented Cessna
across the Soviet border without permission, evaded pursuing jets
and batteries of anti-aircraft missiles and landed safely in Red
Square.
   This prank exposed surprising vulnerabilities in Russia's
defenses and led to the sacking of the Soviet defense minister.
   Convicted of hooliganism and other crimes, Rust was to spend
four years in a labor camp.
   Once sentenced though, he remained in the relative comfort of a
Moscow prison. There he was treated well and given a chance to
learn Russian and a trade.
   The Soviets presumably didn't want Rust to leave with any hard
feelings _ or any inclination to join the West German air force.

   The Daily Journal, International Falls, Minn., on Dukakis health
rumors:
   Gossip is rarely pleasant, and it can be downright hazardous
when rumors find their way into the pages of a newspaper. ...
   An example is the Lyndon LaRouche-inspired rumor that Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis had sought psychiatric help
to overcome depression.
   Although LaRouche's minions produced no evidence to document
their claim, the rumor somehow made it to the front pages of
several of the country's newspapers.
   Dukakis has since denied that he has ever sought psychiatric
treatment, and the evidence bears him out.
   It's unsettling that the media responded to the rumor and
granted it substance by publishing the story. ...
   Seeking psychiatric help to deal with an emotional problem is no
less responsible than seeing a doctor to help cure a physical
ailment.
   In what we assume to be a more enlightened age, the LaRouche
rumor should have been quickly dismissed as a non-issue by the
media.

   Next, wait for the national media to pick up on the rumors _
allegations which no news organization has been able to prove. ...
   The American people's right to know about a candidate's health,
mental and physical, far outweighs any politician's right to
privacy. ...
   Until (Dukakis) lets his medical records speak for themselves,
the public will not be satisfied and political opponents will be
able to raise questions and doubt because of this sordid episode in
dirty politics.

   Los Angeles Times on Dukakis health rumors:
   It is too early to tell whether a physician's report giving Gov.

rumors that he sought psychiatric treatment. ...
   But, amid all the rumors and the innuendoes and the planted
stories, the only question worth raising is: Should a politician
who sought psychiatric care be considered unfit for high office?
   The answer, we submit, is no, that there should be no more
stigma attached to seeing a doctor about depression than about shin
splints or hernias or cancer. ...
   Where psychiatry is concerned, the issue should not be whether
someone once received treatment or not, but whether he or she is
currently fit to hold office.

   Implicit in the badgering of Michael Dukakis about his health
records is a notion that if he had psychotherapy _ which he says he

States.
   The simple fact is that it's just the opposite.
   Seeking professional help for an emotional impasse is as
rational as getting a broken leg set by a physician.
   If the American people stop to think about it, wouldn't it be
preferable to depend on a leader who corrected a personal problem
rather than one who denied or ignored it, letting it impair
decision-making, efficiency and competency?

   The Oregonian, Portland, Ore., on developing a food reserve:
   The drought-relief bill ought to do what it is intended to do,
which is to see the stricken U.S. agricultural industry through its
latest crisis. But it will not put one additional bushel of grain
in the nation's granaries.
   The next agricultural challenge for Congress, therefore, ought
to be development of a strategic food reserve. ...
   The shrinking harvests in this country and in Canada and China
leaves the entire world with a critical shortage of grain.
   The Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C., says that no more
than a 54-day supply is on hand. That compares with a 100-day
supply a year ago.
   The institute warns that food scarcity may dominate the next
decade, constituting a reversal of the problem to which the United
State has become accustomed.
   A similar reversal in congressional thinking needs to accompany
it.

<HEAD>New Orleans Reaches $5.5 Million Goal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials raising money for costs of the
Republican National Convention said today they've come up with the
city's $5.5 million share.
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy said he was pleased the city had gotten
the money through fund-raising and $800,000 from the state, instead
of using a hotel tax such as Atlanta used to help pay for the
Democratic National Convention.
   ``We are often criticized because we do not have our act
together ... This shows we are getting our act together,'' the
mayor said.
   New Orleans pledged to raise the money as part of its agreement
with the Republican Party to land the convention. According to a
final report, the city raised nearly $5.6 million.
   ``As of last night, we had $5,589,000 and contributions are
still coming in,'' said Ron Jones, chairman of the New Orleans
Special Events Fund.
   Contributors included all seven parishes in the New Orleans
metropolitan area and some outside of the region, Jones said.
Corporate contributions ranged from $100 to $250,000, said Jones.
   During an appearance last week before the state Joint
Legislative Budget Committee, which approved the use of state funds
for the convention, Jones said the convention would give Louisiana
an opportunity to attract new business and industry to the state.
   ``This is not just a message about fund-raising, it's a message
about economic development. The convention has given us the
opportunity to change the way America sees Louisiana,'' Jones said
today.

   Republican platform writers agreed today to
keep Michael Dukakis' name out of their party document with the
hope that after the Nov. 8 election the Democratic nominee ``will
fade into oblivion.''
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr opened the platform hearing by asking the
delegates not to refer to Dukakis by name in the document. Orr, the
committee chairman, said past GOP platforms avoided direct
references to the Democrats' nominee.
   ``That's a very good idea since obviously after November 1988
Governor Dukakis will fade into oblivion,'' said New Hampshire Gov.
John Sununu. ``We don't want anyone to have to refer to an
encyclopedia to figure out what we have to say.''
   The Democratic platform does not mention George Bush or Ronald
Reagan by name.
   Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, a co-chairman of the committee,
told reporters that none of the subcommittee revisions was ``giving
anyone major heartburn.'' Kasten said the panel would seek to
finish drafting the platform Thursday, a day ahead of schedule.
   The Republicans also released what they said was a GOP staff
estimate of how much implicit promises in the Democratic platform
will wind up costing taxpayers: $43.1 billion in 1989 alone.
   The full 106-member Republican Platform Committee today began
reviewing the document anew line by line, after seven subcommittees
spent Tuesday putting their imprint on 158 pages of staff-produced
working papers.
   That draft is largely a distillation of policies from the 1984
GOP platform and stands that Bush has staked out on such issues as
child care and education.
   It includes new planks on AIDS and the homeless, as well as the
GOP's hard and fast line against abortion and higher taxes.
   Orr said the subcommittees were not making major changes, but
emphasized, ``Until we're done on Friday, it's not a done deal,
It's not over with.''
   The subcommittees, taking advice from such Bush campaign
emissaries as former Texas Sen. John Tower, resisted most moves to
push the platform to the left or right.
   The defense subcommittee called for ``rapid and certain
deployment of SDI as technology permits.'' The original draft,
echoing Bush campaign language, had just spoken of deployment ``as
soon as possible.''
   In the family subcommittee, Lynn Glaze, a Delaware delegate, was
rebuffed three times when she sought to soften the anti-abortion
language. Her motions were tabled without discussion, as was her
call for support of the Equal Rights Amendment.
   Bunny Chambers, a member of the conservative Eagle Forum from
Oklahoma City who moved to table Glaze's amendments, said, ``I felt
like we'd discussed enough (in the past). I didn't want to spend
all the time on it.''
   The family subcommittee also killed a plank on the special needs
of ``little persons'' _ dwarfs. Committee members expressed
confusion about the term `little persons'' and what the plank was
doing in the draft.
   On AIDS, not addressed in 1984, the draft promises to ``not only
marshal our scientific resources against AIDS, but ... protect
those who do not have the disease.'' It is silent on the civil
rights legislation for AIDS victims recommended by a presidential
commission.
   The family subcommittee did amend the AIDS plank to say victims
``should be encouraged to seek early diagnosis and to remain on the
job or in school as long as they are functionally able.''
   The defense subcommittee balked at an amendment by its
co-chairman, Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, to declare a goal of U.S.
``space dominance.'' Buchanan, the former U.S. treasurer from
Irvine, Calif., said she was satisfied with compromise language
that space must be kept free and secure for all nations.
   Gone from the draft documents was the 1984 GOP declaration that
``we shall keep the peace by keeping our country stronger than any
potential adversary.''
   On taxes, the draft says, ``Republicans unequivocally reiterate
the no-tax pledge we have proudly kept.''
   Like the 1984 platform, the draft calls for the appointment of
judges ``who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of
human life.''
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut skipped Tuesday's
session to return to Washington, but planned to be back today to
wage his uphill battle for liberal amendments.
   The draft documents back a line-item veto, a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution and ``a flexible freeze on current
government spending.''
   They endorse a child-care tax credit for families of modest
means. Bush recently proposed a $1,000-per-child credit for
families with incomes up to $20,000.
   The draft speaks of the importance of imparting to children
``the Judeo-Christian values of Western civilization and our ideals
of liberty.'' The family subcommittee rejected an amendment to
change ``Judeo-Christian'' to ``traditional.''
   On abortion, the draft declares ``the unborn child has a
fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed,''
and calls again for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
   It says, ``Republicans deplore the apartheid system of South
Africa,'' but warns against economic pressures that harm black
workers and entrepreneurs there.
   The foreign policy panel added a plank declaring that,
``Republicans are strongly committed to obtaining the freedom of
all Americans held captive by terrorist elements in the Middle
East.''

   A judge today extended until Thursday afternoon the
deadline for Maria DeSillers to give up a BMW car, jewelry and
other items allegedly bought with money donated for her son's liver
transplants.
   Ms. DeSillers, who missed an earlier deadline Tuesday, vowed to
defy the judge on at least one item, the deed to a cemetery plot
beside that of her son, Ronnie, a 7-year-old who died last year
while awaiting his fourth transplant.
   ``I'll be damned if I'll turn over the cemetery plot where I was
supposed to go next to my son,'' Mrs. DeSillers said. ``If they
want it, they're going to have to take me with it.''
   Probate Judge Francis Christie had earlier ordered Ms. DeSillers
to turn over the luxury items by Tuesday afternoon. But he gave her
an extension today because she replaced her attorney with Johnson.
   Her attorney, Frank Johnson, said he had not decided what steps
to take.
   The judge was to rule later on whether to charge Ms. DeSillers
with contempt for withholding financial records sought by the
curator.
   Ms. DeSillers is accused of misusing some of nearly $689,000
donated for her son's transplants, including $1,000 from President
Reagan. She claims the money is hers as Ronnie's heir.
   After Ronnie's death in 1987, his mother spent $11,000 on
jewelry, gave a total of $40,000 to her brother, ex-husband and
ex-boyfriend, and paid herself an $88,000 salary to head her
now-defunct Ronnie DeSillers National Foundation, according to the
curator of the boy's estate.
   Ms. DeSillers has refused to pay a $262,000 bill from Pittsburgh
Children's Hospital, which she faults for her son's death, a charge
doctors there vehemently deny.
   Christie has ruled that the $243,000 remaining in the boy's
estate will pay his outstanding hospital bills and may also be
given to other needy, ill children.
   Ms. DeSillers contends that she bought the disputed items with
her own money. But Robin Gievers, curator of Ronnie's estate, says
that after the boy's death, Ms. DeSillers had no job or income
source besides the donations.

<HEAD>Analysts: Discount Rate Hike Likely To Mean Other Rates Move
Higher</HEAD>

prices. A version moved on the financial wire</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve's unexpected jolt to its key
bank lending rate _ to a 2{-year high _ likely will push other
interest rates higher, including those on home mortgages,
economists predict.
   The Fed announced Tuesday it was raising its discount rate to
6.5 percent from 6 percent, to help curb inflation and to account
for the recent rise of open-market interest rates.
   The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges on
loans to member banks. A change in the closely-watched rate is the
most dramatic move the Fed can make in signaling its credit
policies.
   Because the banks set their interest rates based on how much it
costs them to borrow money, many economists predict other rates
will edge higher due to Tuesday's action. That likely will mean
consumers will have to pay more for credit on houses, cars and
items charged on credit cards.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we had another (bank) prime rate
hike by Friday,'' said David Resler, chief economist for Nomura
Securities Inc.
   Financial markets reacted quickly to Tuesday's move, with the
dollar soaring and stock and bond prices falling sharply.
   The dollar jumped to 135.15 Japanese yen in New York from
133.725 yen late Monday, and rose sharply against other major
currencies.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
28.27 points to 2,079.13 amid speculation of further rate
increases. It was down 33 points more by midday today.
   In the credit markets, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond
fell by about $10 per $1,000 face amount, while its yield jumped to
9.19 percent from 9.10 percent late Monday.
   A month ago, major banks boosted their prime lending rates to
9.5 percent, the highest level in more than two years, from 9
percent in response to rising interest rates in the credit markets,
which had boosted the banks' cost of borrowing.
   The prime is a key rate used to calculate a range of fixed and
adjustable-rate corporate and consumer loans.
   Many economists had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the
money supply this week, but few were expecting a discount rate hike.
   ``The (credit) markets have been screaming for a discount rate
increase for quite some time; the surprise was in the timing of
it,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co.
   ``Not only is the Republican convention coming up, but we're in
the middle of a Treasury refunding,'' in which the government is
auctioning off $22 billion in new notes this week to pay off its
old debts, Kellner said.
   ``I don't think inflation is any worse today than it was last
year,'' said Kellner.
   Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko Securities
Co. International Inc., defended the discount-rate hike.
   ``It's the Fed's job to throw cold water on the economy when it
starts overheating and that's what it appears to be doing right
now,'' he said.
   Among recent signs of economic strength was the July
unemployment rate, which at 5.4 percent was near its 14-year lows.
   Tuesday's increase brings the discount rate to its highest level
since April 1986, when it was lowered to 6.5 percent from 7 percent.
   The hike was the second since Alan Greenspan replaced Paul A.
Volcker at the Fed's helm a year ago. On Sept. 4, the central bank
raised the rate for the first time in three years, to 6 percent
from 5.5 percent.
   While September's increase also was taken in response to
inflationary fears, some analysts later cited it as a contributing
factor to the Oct. 19 stock market crash.

<HEAD>Perot Deal to be Shelved, Competition Sought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank said today
that his agency is shelving a major portion of its controversial
contract with Texas billionnaire H. Ross Perot and will seek
competitive bidding.
   One portion of the deal to help improve postal efficiency has
drawn sharp criticism because of its seemingly open-ended payment
structure and the fact that it was negotiated without competitive
bidding.
   ``We are now aware of ... concerns and believe we can overcome
them by modifying the contract,'' Frank told two Senate
subcommittees.
   Frank said he hopes to be able to resume one part of the deal, a
six-month, $500,000 agreement for Perot Systems Inc. to analyze
various postal operations and recommend ways to save money.
   But the second part, in which the savings would be implemented,
will no longer be the sole scope of Perot, Frank said.
   The original contract gave Perot the exclusive right to
implement its recommendations, and would have based payment on a
percentage of any savings.
   Under a re-negotiated deal, these money-saving projects, said
Frank, ``would be done on a fully competitive basis, and Perot
Systems would not compete for this business.''
   The contract has been suspended at the recommendation of the
General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals, although
the Postal Service contends that the board doesn't have
jurisdiction over it.
   Once that dispute is settled, other modifications to the Perot
contract can also be worked out, Frank said, including its length
and the ability of the government to terminate the agreement.
   Frank's testimony came at a joint hearing of the Senate
Governmental Affairs subcommittees on federal services, post office
and civil service and on oversight of government operations.

<HEAD>Canadians Shed `99 Tears' For Loss of National Treasure Gretzky</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Edmonton, members of Parliament and
even Wayne Gretzky's father bemoaned the loss of the hockey
superstar to the United States, but it's a path pioneered by many
other Canadians from Mary Pickford to Michael J. Fox.
   The decision Tuesday by the Edmonton Oilers to trade Gretzky _
``The Great One'' _ to the Los Angeles Kings touched the most
sensitive nerve in this northern culture: the fear that Canada's
best and brightest inevitably end up in the United States.
   The expatriates include economist John Kenneth Galbraith and
anchorman Peter Jennings, but it's Hollywood that has brought the
most fame to Canadians such as Miss Pickford, Fox, Glenn Ford,
Raymond Burr, Lorne Greene, Raymond Massey, Ruby Keeler, Yvonne De
Carlo, Rich Little, John Candy and Margot Kidder.
   ``It's like ripping a heart out of a city,'' said dejected
Edmonton Mayor Laurence Decore, who credits Gretzky with putting
his blue-collar city of 574,000 people on the map.
   It is not just for the four Stanley Cups and his numerous
records that Gretzky will be missed. His sincerity and quiet charm
made him a goodwill ambassador for the city.
   The tabloid Edmonton Sun carried a simple, sad headline
Wednesday: ``99 Tears,'' referring to the number on Gretzky's
jersey.
   Telephone lines to local radio stations were jammed.
   ``We've had literally hundreds of calls,'' said Rod Phillips,
play-by-play announcer for Edmonton radio station CFRN. ``Everyone
we talked to said, `That's it, I'm never going to see another
Oilers game.'''
   Callers blamed Gretzky's departure on the American he married
July 16, actress Janet Jones, who has a home in Los Angeles.
   Although 3,000 fans lovingly greeted the newlyweds when they
were married in a lavish ceremony in Edmonton, many people have now
turned against the bride. She was likened to John Lennon's widow,
Yoko Ono, blamed by some fans for the breakup of the Beatles.
   An Edmonton Sun editorial disagreed. ```The Great One' owes
Edmonton nothing ... It is Edmonton who owes Gretzky. And all we
can do it seems in repayment is label Gretzky a traitor (and) call
his new wife a Jezebel.''
   Many fans were bitter because the trade came one day after the
deadline for renewing season tickets, and one irate supporter
burned an effigy of Oilers' owner Peter Pocklington in front of
national TV cameras.
   In Ottawa, Parliament member Nelson Riis of the New Democratic
Party made a tongue-in-cheek demand for government intervention.
   ``Wayne Gretzky is a national symbol, like the beaver,'' Riis
said. ``The Edmonton Oilers without Wayne Gretzky is like apple pie
without ice cream, like winter without snow, like the `Wheel of
Fortune' without Vanna White.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's office stayed out of the
controversy.
   ``We wish Mr. Gretzky well and we're sure he will be a great
representative of Canada and all that's finest in Canada's national
game no matter where he plays,'' a spokesman for Mulroney told The
Associated Press.
   One official pointed out that Bobby Orr, Gordie Howe and Bobby
Hull _ three other Canadian hockey legends _ also played for
American teams.
   Legislators in Alberta Province demanded an investigation of
government loans given Pocklington on the basis of his contract
with Gretzky as collateral.
   ``The government should hold up the deal until they've
investigated to make sure the taxpayers aren't being honked,'' said
Liberal Party leader Nick Taylor.
   Gretzky's father, Walter, who trained his son on a backyard rink
in Brantford, Ontario, said he was as patriotic as any other
Canadian and was sorry to see the move.
   ``He's a Canadian institution and had been in Edmonton for nine
years. But if it's what Wayne wants and it makes him happy, then
I'm delighted for him,'' he said.
   If there was one bright spot on the Canadian landscape it glowed
in Calgary, the southern Alberta city whose team, the Flames, are
locked in a bitter rivalry with the Oilers.
   ``This should be a civic holiday here,'' said Calgary fan David
Scott.

   The House on Thursday approved legislation to
give an additional $350,000 to the chamber's ethics committee for
investigations for the remainder of the year.
   The House voted 408-0 to nearly double the current fiscal 1988
appropriation of $400,000 for the House Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, which is the panel's official name.
   The need for the additional funds was made necessary, primarily,
by the committee's investigation of House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, and its appointment of Chicago attorney Richard Phelan as
a special prosecutor to conduct the inquiry.
   The contract with Phelan's law firm for the year calls for
$300,000 from the committee's primary funding.

   An 800-pound man unable to get out of
bed was loaded by forklift onto a flatbed truck today, evicted from
his dilapidated bungalow.
   Michael Edelman was taken to a hospital until an apartment can
be renovated to accommodate the 24-year-old man too big to squeeze
through a regular-size doorway.
   Edelman, who had lived in the bungalow for two years with his
400-pound mother, Arlene, had put off eviction with court
challenges since April. His landlord wants to redevelop the
property in this suburb north of New York City.
   Edelman came to public attention in December when he fell out of
bed and had to be lifted up by a tow truck.

   U.N. officials say that unless withheld
dues are paid, particularly by Washington, they'll be hard pressed
to fund the force of international military observers monitoring a
truce in the Iran-Iraq war.
   A first contingent of five observers arrived in Tehran today,
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today said
Persian Gulf nations would be urged to donate a substantial portion
of the peacekeeping effort's cost.
   ``We'll be giving the same message to other countries like Japan
and others who have an interest in the gulf,'' Fitzwater said.
   Japan, which imports nearly all its oil from the gulf region,
already has donated $20 million this year to U.N. peacekeeping
efforts, earmarking half of the amount for the Iran-Iraq peace
effort.
   Those funds are being used as the seed money to begin the
cease-fire monitoring effort, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said
today.
   The Security Council met today in informal consultations to
approve the secretary-general's list of the 24 nations sending
officers to monitor the cease-fire.
   The nations are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, India,
Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway,
Poland, Senegal, Sweden, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Zambia.
   Next week, the General Assembly will reconvene in special
session to approve funding for the Iran-Iraq cease-fire monitoring
group, said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes. The special session
begins Tuesday and is expected to last two days.
   The U.N., financially ailing mainly because America has been
withholding a large part of its assessed contribution for several
years, is due to run out of funds in October, ``or even earlier if
we continue at this rate,'' Giuliani said.
   The Security Council voted unanimously Tuesday to authorize the
350-member U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, a day after
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced a cease-fire
effective Aug. 20.
   Direct peace talks between Iran and Iraq are scheduled to begin
five days later in Geneva.
   Cyrus Nasseri, head of the Iranian mission to the United Nations
in Geneva, said in Tehran today that lasting peace will result only
if Iraq is branded the aggressor in the war and Iran receives
compensation.
   Tehran Radio said Iraqi warplanes violated Iranian airspace in
the southwest. No bombing was reported, and the official Iraqi News
Agency carried no reports of fighting.
   More than 24 hours after receiving word of a truce in the
8-year-old war, Iraqis continued to celebrate, honking horns and
jumping out of cars to dance in Baghdad's traffic-clogged streets.
   Iran, which had suffered a recent string of battlefield defeats,
had a more subdued reaction. The nation's acting commander-in-chief
and parliament spearker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said soldiers should
remain vigilant in the face of Iraqi ``mischief.''
   In a statement read over Tehran Radio, he said Iran would not
initiate ``any kind of military and armed moves. But just like
always, (Iran) will be ready to give an appropriate response to the
mischiefs of the enemy.''
   Marrick Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general in charge of
peacekeeping operations, told The Associated Press all 350
observers are expected at the 730-mile front in a week.
   In a report to the 15-member Security Council, Perez de Cuellar
estimated the force's cost at $74 million.
   ``I simply do not have the money for this,'' he said. He looked
at one American reporter and added: ``You should advise your
government to participate fully in these efforts for peace.''
   The United States, which is assessed more than $200 million a
year _ a quarter of the annual U.N. budget _ is $467 million in
arrears. The total of unpaid contributions to the U.N. budget by
member nations is $602 million.
   The United States has said it was holding back funding to demand
reform in the budget-making process, personnel cuts and changes in
practices that allow Soviet U.N. employees to remain under their
government's control.
   ``I think the United States will meet its obligations and make
its payments,'' said U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters.
   ``This (U.N. peace effort) proves definitively that the United
Nations has a purpose, that it is useful to all peace-loving
countries, including the United States of America,'' he said. ``It
has stopped the biggest war since World War II.''
   Perez de Cuellar announced the cease-fire date after Iraq gave
up its demand for face-to-face talks with Iran as a precondition to
a truce.
   Iraq had demanded the talks as a test of Iran's sincerity in
accepting the cease-fire resolution July 18, a full year after the
Security Council passed it.
   Resolution 598 calls for a cease-fire; withdrawal to
internationally recognized borders; exchange of prisoners; peace
talks; and establishment of an impartial commission to judge
responsibility for the conflict.
   Iran repeatedly has said it wants Iraq branded the aggressor in
the war. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border
skirmishes.

   A 230-pound weight lifter and martial arts
expert foiled a bank robbery by chasing a man and taking him back
to the bank.
   ``He wasn't all that big,'' said Bob Hughes. ``It was just a
reaction. I just did it.''
   Hughes said he was driving into the parking lot of a U.S. Bank
branch Tuesday when he saw a woman run from the bank.
   ``She was yelling for someone to stop,'' Hughes said. ``I looked
around and saw this guy running down the street. I thought he had
taken her purse.''
   Hughes made a U-turn, drove down the street, stopped his car and
ran after the man.
   ``I really didn't know what to do with him, so I pinned his
hands behind his back and turned him into the wall,'' he said.
``When I saw he didn't have a purse, I realized he had robbed the
bank. Then I literally walked him back to the bank.''
   Police Detective David Simpson said Bradley R. Wilson, 37, was
accused of bank robbery and held at the Justice Center jail.

   Michael Dukakis today defended his first-term
decision not to begin cleaning up Boston Harbor and shrugged off
polls showing that George Bush has cut into his lead in the
presidential race.
   The Massachusetts governor, at a groundbreaking ceremony at the
site of part of the harbor project, said those who blame him for
delaying the cleanup are preaching ``revisionist history.''
   In his first term in the mid-1970s, Dukakis decided against
proceeding with a clean-up plan. Shortly after he was voted out of
office in 1978, the state applied for a waiver from the Clean Water
Act.
   He stood by that decision today, saying there ``were very
respected people, experts in the field, who disagreed'' on what
needed to be done to rid the harbor of pollution.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency eventually rejected
the waiver request and a subsequent appeal and the state is now
under federal court order to complete the cleanup by 1999. It is
expected to cost at least $6 billion.
   Dukakis, responding to reporters' questions at the ceremony,
said he was not surprised to see that his lead in the polls has
been cut by the Republican vice president.
   ``This is going to be a very tough, competitive 90 days,''
Dukakis said of his race with Bush heading into the November
election.
   Dukakis was spending most of today at the Statehouse before
heading back out to campaign Thursday and Friday.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis turned back Bush's latest salvo with a line
nearly copied from the president's political phrasebook.
   ``There he goes again,'' Dukakis responded to Bush's accusation
that he is on the `liberal fringe.'' President Reagan used a
similar line in 1980 as he debated Jimmy Carter.
   The vice president renewed his attack while Dukakis joined
fellow governors at a national gathering in Cincinnati, and
attended a second private session with Democratic governors who
emerged praising his candidacy and promising to support it.
   The governors ``are going to be an essential part of this
campaign, they are going to be an essential part of the next
administration,'' said Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts.
   Bush, in Pennsylvania, charged Dukakis was on the ``very, very
far liberal fringe'' and that his lead was evaporating.
   With less than a week to go before the Republicans hold their
convention in New Orleans, where Dukakis can expect to come under
intense attack, Dukakis aides maintained they were unconcerned by
the new Gallup poll showing a 10 point decline in Dukakis'
advantage over the vice president.
   The survey showed his 17-point lead had declined to a
seven-point margin of 49 percent to 42 percent.
   Campaign spokesman Mark Gearan called the decline
``understandable'' and attributed it to a public shift in focus to
the Republicans in advance of the Republican National Convention
which begins Monday in New Orleans.
   ``After the Republican convention it could be very, very
close,'' Gearan said. ``It could be dead even, if not showing
George Bush taking the advantage.''
   He said the 1984 Democratic nominee, Walter Mondale, rose
dramatically in the polls during his convention week that year _ a
rise that proved only momentary.
   At the National Governors' Association, Dukakis went to the site
of a housing development project to call attention to a resolution
passed on a unanimous, bipartisan vote calling for a new national
housing policy.
   The proposal calls for a $2.8 billion increase in government
spending on housing to help states and cities expand the supply of
affordable housing through grants and tax measures. It would
provide rent subsidies and address what Dukakis called ``the
problem of home ownership for young families.''
   ``What's missing these days is any sense in the White House that
there is a national commitment to affordable housing to the people
of this country,'' Dukakis said. ``I don't just mean families of
low and moderate income. I mean young families, who ought to have
an opportunity to own their own home, at a price they can afford.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today the fall campaign against
George Bush is going to be ``a very tough, competitive 90 days,''
as new poll numbers and big dollar figures gave Republicans a boost
in advance of next week's convention.
   A Gallup Poll released Tuesday put Dukakis' margin at seven
points over Bush, less than half of the 17-point edge the
Massachusetts governor enjoyed coming out of the Democratic
National Convention last month in Atlanta.
   ``I like it, I like it,'' Bush said Tuesday night in
Philadelphia.
   Althought Bush was quick to say he doesn't trust the polls, he
did agree that ``Things are moving. We're beginning to get them in
focus.''
   Dukakis said in Boston today that he was not surprised by the
swinging numbers in the polls.
   ``This is going to be a very tough, competitive 90 days''
through the Nov. 8 election, the Democratic presidential nominee
said.
   Bush still has the Republican National Convention to come,
beginning Monday in New Orleans, with its four nights of prime time
partisanship designed to boost his standing with the voters. He was
spending today in Washington and working on his acceptance speech.
   The Republican National Committee got good news from its finance
officials today, hearing that the party has $13.5 million cash on
hand toward a goal of ``more than $70 million toward election of
Republican candidates at all levels'' this year.
   With Dukakis and Bush staying close to home today, former
Democratic hopeful Jesse Jackson lashed out at both men for their
recent campaign styles.
   ``This campaign ought to focus on direction and not on dirt,''
Jackson told reporters after having breakfast in Washington with
Democratic House members. ``This campaign boils down to Bush
attacking Dukakis with one-liners every day, and Dukakis is
becoming preoccupied with the Bush-Noriega connection, the
Bush-Iran-Contra connection, of exchanging drugs for arms.
   ``If it gets warped into sleaze, then there will be no hope left
for the people,'' Jackson added.
   Dukakis moved to blunt a stinging Republican attack on his
support for a clean environment.
   The Massachusetts governor took part in the ground-breaking for
a new sewage treatment plant on Boston Harbor, the first step in a
$6 billion effort to clean up what the Environmental Protection
Agency has called the filthiest harbor in the nation.
   In his first term as governor, Dukakis opposed committing
massive resources to the cleanup. Today, he defended that decision,
saying there ``were very respected people, experts in the field,
who disagreed'' on what needed to be done to rid the harbor of
pollution.
   He fired back at those who blame him for the pollution problems,
saying they are guilty of ``revisionist history.''
   Bush had been getting some political mileage out of the harbor
pollution.
   ``He goes down to New Jersey and talks about the pollution off
of New Jersey and look, over his shoulder is Boston Harbor, one of
the most seriously polluted bodies of water in this country,'' Bush
said Sunday.
   Tuesday brought good news for Bush in a new poll.
   The Gallup survey put Dukakis's support at 49 percent and Bush's
at 42 percent in telephone interviews with 1,004 registered voters
Aug. 5-7.
   Only two weeks ago, Dukakis was sporting a 17-point margin over
Bush, a 54-37 result in a Gallup Poll. Each survey had a 3
percentage point margin of error.
   That would mean that the ``bump'' Dukakis gained from the
Democratic convention had essentially evaporated.
   Larry Bathgate of New Jersey, GOP national finance chairman,
said the committee had raised $34.9 million in the first seven
months of this year. the second largest amount the RNC had ever
raised in such a time period. In addition, he said the convention
gala _ a luncheon scheduled next Thursday _ is expected to raise
between $5 million and $6 million.
   The Democrats also aren't doing badly in the money department,
House Speaker Jim Wright said in Washington, noting the party
raised about $12 million at this point, compared to a $9 million
debt in 1984.
   ``We are somewhat stunned. We just don't know how to take that
prosperity. We have a self-identify problem. We never had money in
the bank. We've always been in debt,'' Wright said after a private
meeting with Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich.
   Tuesday also brought another round of charges and countercharges
between the major-party presidential candidates on themes that may
well dominate the fall campaign.
   Each sought to raise questions about just where his opponent
stands on the issues.
   ``He's trying to run away from a record in Massachusetts on the
very, very far liberal fringe,'' Bush said of Dukakis. ``He thinks
he can pre-empt the middle.''
   ``There he goes again,'' replied Dukakis, recalling the line
Ronald Reagan used to cut down Jimmy Carter in a 1980 presidential
debate.
   Bush had labeled Dukakis the ``stealth candidate'' on Monday,
but the Democratic nominee came straight back at the incumbent vice
president.
   ``I don't think Bush's positions are clear on much of
anything,'' Dukakis said before the National Governors' Association
meeting in Cincinnati.
   In fact, Dukakis took the unusual position of claiming that
President Reagan is closer to his position on a range of important
issues than he is to Bush.
   ``It's an administration that's growing,'' Dukakis said.
``Frankly, they're coming a lot closer to where I am. ... The
interesting thing is the president and I are closer together on
U.S.-Soviet relations than he is with Bush.''
   The Republican nominee-to-be said he is still not ready to talk
about his choice of a running mate, the remaining piece of the
puzzle to set up the fall election campaign.
   ``I'm not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a final
decision,'' the vice president said, adding he is holding to his
plan to announce this choice on the convention's final day.

<HEAD>American Airlines To Base 700 Employees in Southern Florida</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines today announced plans to base up
to 700 pilots and flight attendants in southern Florida, home of
embattled Eastern Airlines.
   American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is ``deeply committed to
the Florida market and believes Florida will play a critical role
in our future expansion,'' said Robert W. Baker, senior vice
president for operations.
   American, one of the industry's fastest-growing large airlines,
also announced it will add a flight attendant crew base in
Nashville, Tenn. The Miami and Nashville sites bring American's
total crew bases to 12.
   By January, American will base 160 flight crew members in Miami,
Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Baker said. The total will
reach 700 within a few years, he said.
   Baker said several hundred American employees already live in
South Florida.
   American officials said that the move will help in expanding
service to the Caribbean that began with establishment of a hub in
San Juan, Puerto Rico, but that it was too early to estimate the
number of new flights that could be added.
   American over the past two years increased its daily flights in
Florida from 29 to 78 and boarded nearly 1 million passengers in
Florida in the first six months of 1988 compared to 412,000 the
first half of 1986.
   American's growth comes as Miami-based Eastern Airlines is
cutting back, and could put American in position to capitalize on
the problems of Eastern and Pan American World Airways.
   Eastern and Pan Am, the two most active carriers at Miami
International Airport, are seeking major labor cutbacks and there
has been speculation they are considering selling off their
lucrative South American routes.
   Baker said American's expansion to southern Florida is based on
long-term plans, not on competitors' possibly temporary problems.
   ``I don't think it will have any effect,'' Eastern spokeswoman
Paual Musto said. ``American is in a growing mode, and if Miami is
their choice, I say more power to the Miami community and economy.''
   Eastern, with its corporate headquarters here, has some 850
pilots and 1,800 flight attendants based in Miami, she said.
   Texas Air Corp. on Monday announced it lost $255.9 million in
the second quarter, with operating losses at both its major
carriers _ Eastern and Continental Airlines.
   American's new flight attendant crew base in Nashville will have
75 flight attendants in October and perhaps as many as 600 in the
early 1990s, the airline said.

<TEXT>
   Two members of Congress presented their first
``Globe Rotter Award'' to the Department of Energy on Wednesday,
putting the agency in their ``Environmental Hall of Shame'' for a
leaking radioactive waste dump.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., cited
the department ``for its callous disregard of the environment and
its leaking of plutonium at one of our country's oldest and largest
nuclear waste dump _ Idaho National Laboratory.''
   They said the award was based partly on a recent Energy
Department report that said volatile organic chemicals from 2
million cubic feet of waste at the facility have reached an
underground water supply 580 feet below the dump.
   The report said radioactive material had migrated downward to at
least 110 feet and may have reached 240 feet. The report estimates
it will cost $633.2 million through 1995 to clean up the facility.
   Levine said the southeast Idaho laboratory is one of 19
department facilities that the agency estimates could require $100
billion to clean up.
   ``At least two-thirds of these sites are experiencing critical
contamination or storage crises,'' Levine told a news conference.
``DOE may be underestimating the cost of cleanup by as much as 50
percent.''
   Reid said the environmental records of some federal agencies are
a ``disgrace.''
   ``Some of the worst hazardous waste problems in the United
States are located at federal facilities,'' he said.
   The lawmakers said they created the award to focus attention on
environmental problems around the country in the hope of spurring
the executive and legislative branches to take stronger corrective
action.
   Reid said the ``Globe Rotter'' is modeled after the monthly
``Golden Fleece'' award that Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., has
presented for years for waste and inefficiency in federal programs.
   Reid said he was unable to get anyone from the department to
accept the first ``Globe Rotter'' certificate.
   But in lieu of an acceptance speech, Energy Department spokesman
Doug Elmets said: ``We are aware of the problem in Idaho. We found
it. This is residue from operations that stopped almost 20 years
ago. The (radioactive) problem is not near the water table. We've
implemented a cleanup plan.''

   A white foster mother drew five years in
prison for the dehydration death of a foster baby who prosecutors
said was neglected because he was black.
   Judith Lundy was convicted in June of murder and manslaughter in
the 1985 death of 4-month-old Corey Greer. The 50-year-old woman
Tuesday told Judge Susan Schaeffer, ``I take full responsibility.''
   Mrs. Lundy allowed the infant to die in a steamy, urine-soaked
room because touching a black baby gave her ``the willies,''
according to testimony at her trial.
   At the time of the baby's death, Mrs. Lundy was caring for 12
foster children and her own daughter. She was licensed by the state
to care for only four children.
   In the aftermath, state officials admitted failing to ensure
that foster children were placed in clean, uncrowded foster homes.
Thirteen employees of the Health and Rehabilitative Service
Department were disciplined.
   The judge agreed Tuesday that the state child care agency had
been negligent in placing so many children in Mrs. Lundy's care but
said the department was not on trial.
   Prosecutors said Mrs. Lundy allowed an 8-year-old foster child
to tend the baby. The 8-year-old testified she told Mrs. Lundy that
Corey seemed sick the night before he died.

<HEAD>Party Journals Attack Dubcek, Followers as Anniversary Nears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party daily
newspaper launched an unusually strong attack Wednesday on
Alexander Dubcek, accusing him of causing the invasion that
destroyed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968.
   The newspaper, Rude Pravo, charged Dubcek with deceiving his
fellow Communists and the people, and said he had slowed the
implementation of reforms since.
   The article was the strongest in a series of recent attacks on
Dubcek, who won unprecedented national popularity for reform after
he became party leader in January 1968.
   The attacks seem designed to discredit Dubcek in the eyes of his
compatriots. The former leader, now a retired forestry worker in
Bratislava, has received increased attention at home and abroad as
the 20th anniversary of the August 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion nears.
   Dubcek has recently given interviews to Western news media in
which he has praised Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms
and called for his own rehabilitation and the implementation of
similar reforms in Czechoslovakia.
   The party's theoretical and political monthly, Nova Mysl, said
in its latest issue that Dubcek and his followers were responsible
for the ``crisis'' of August 1968 when the country was ``on the
brink of civil war.''
   During the night of Aug. 20-21 1968, Soviet and Warsaw Pact
tanks moved into Czechoslovakia to crush the liberal reforms
introduced by Dubcek in what came to be known as the Prague Spring.
   Rude Pravo and other official media have repeatedly rejected
parallels between Dubcek's reforms and those under way in the
Soviet Union.
   Dubcek bears ``grave personal responsibility ... that the road
to implementing (reforms) took much longer and was much more
difficult,'' the official CTK news agency quoted the Rude Pravo
article as saying.
   Czechoslovakia is adopting some cautious economic reform in the
wake of changes in the Soviet Union, but has done little to reform
either the arts or political structures.
   Rude Pravo's attack seemed to be an attempt to blame Dubcek for
the lack of more radical changes.
   ``Dubcek was no pioneer of democratic freedoms in the party and
society,'' the article said. ``He became co-responsible for
unparalleled autocratic manners (and) ... assumed the right to
decide for the whole party at the most fateful moments,'' it said.
   ``Thanks to his lack of reliability, the leadership of the party
lost its credibility'' and leaders of Czechoslovakia's East bloc
allies ``no longer believed we would be able to handle the
continuously deteriorating situation,'' Rude Pravo said.
   The Czechoslovak leadership has refused to reevaluate the events
of 1968.
   Gustav Husak, the Communist leader who took over as party leader
from Dubcek in 1969, was replaced in December, but there have been
few indications the new leader, Milos Jakes, is less hardline.
Jakes oversaw the purge of half a million Communists after the 1968
invasion.

   A beaming Prince Andrew welcomed Princess Diana
and her two sons with kisses and hugs when they arrived at Portland
Hospital on Wednesday for the first glimpse of the newest addition
to the royal family.
   Andrew's wife, Sarah, the Duchess of York, gave birth Monday
night to their first child, the still-unnamed Princess of York.
Mother and daughter are ``very well,'' Buckingham Palace said.
   Coral Bookmakers offered short odds on the princess being named
Charlotte, although British newspapers speculated Annabel, Victoria
and Elizabeth were also possible choices.
   More than 100 well-wishers cheered as Diana and her sons,
Princes William and Harry, arrived for their brief visit.
   It is not known when the duchess and baby will leave hospital,
although Andrew must return to his Royal Navy duties in the Far
East next week.
   The palace confirmed the duchess was expected to take the baby
to Balmoral Castle in Scotland ``at some stage'' this summer to see
her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   Andrew is the queen's second-oldest son and the baby is her
fifth grandchild.

<HEAD>Study: Survival Benefits of Bypass Surgery Last at Least 12 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coronary bypass surgery improves the survival of
high-risk patients with heart disease, and the benefits persist for
at least 12 years, a study concludes.
   The research, conducted in Europe, found that men with serious
heart disease who got the operations outlived those who were
treated with medicines. However, the difference between the two
groups faded over time.
   Coronary bypass operations are often performed to relieve
symptoms of heart pain called angina. Whether the surgery helps
people live longer is controversial.
   Two other long-running U.S. studies have found no benefit of the
common operations on survival. However, experts say differences in
the health of patients who took part in the three studies probably
explain why the European outcome was better.
   That followup, known as the European Coronary Surgery Study
Group, found that after five years, 92 percent of the bypass
patients were alive, compared with 83 percent in a group treated
with medicine. After 12 years, 71 percent of the surgical patients
and 67 percent of the medical patients were living.
   ``The reasons for the loss of a beneficial effect of surgery
after five years are unknown and merit further study,'' the doctors
wrote.
   The latest results of the European study, directed by Dr.
Edvardas Varnauskas of Sahlgrenska Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden,
were published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The study was conducted on 767 men, all under age 65, who had
mild or moderate angina. Most were considered at high risk because
of abnormal electrocardiograms and other signs of heart trouble.
   Last year, about 230,000 coronary bypass operations were
performed at non-federal hospitals in the United States. In this
surgery, doctors use pieces of blood vessel to detour blood around
clogged arteries in the heart.
   In an editorial in the journal, Dr. Thomas Killip of Beth Israel
Medical Center in New York wrote that the studies show that
``surgical therapy improves prognosis in high-risk patients, but
the advantage over medical therapy declines with longer followup.''

   Soviet inspectors finished checking two
U.S. cruise missile sites in Belgium on Wednesday under terms of
the superpower treaty to eliminate medium- and shorter-range
nuclear weapons.
   The 20 Soviet experts visited the Florennes Air Base, about 40
miles south of Brussels, and the European Repair Facility at nearby
Gosselies.
   Florennes, which houses the 485th U.S. Tactical Missile Wing,
has 16 ground-launched cruise missiles with four spares and four
missile launchers with eight spares, according to U.S. officials.
   The Gosselies facility, run by the Belgian defense contractor
Sabca, services all U.S. missiles based in Europe. On June 21,
there were 55 missiles at the plant, according to the officials.
   The Soviets, who arrived Monday, entered the two sites on
Tuesday and returned to Brussels on Wednesday. It was not known
when they would return to the Soviet Union.
   The inspections are required under the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty, signed in December by President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The treaty provides for
elimination within three years of all U.S. and Soviet land-based
missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   As part of the 60-day inspection process that began July 1, the
Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the United States and five in
Western European, while U.S. experts are inspecting 133 sites in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   Soviet teams have also viewed missile sites in Germany, Britain
and the Netherlands.
   Each inspection lasts up to 24 hours, with a possible eight-hour
extension.

   A group of veteran South Korean climbers
set out Wednesday with hopes of conquering Mount Everest, the
world's highest peak, to celebrate the Seoul Olympics.
   The climbers will try to scale the 29,028-foot peak the hard way
_ via the steep South Pillar route _ ``because none of our
countrymen has ever done it in the past,'' said team leader Choi
Chang-min of Seoul.
   Although the South Pillar route is the most direct path to the
top of Everest, only two men _ one from Poland and another from
Czechoslovakia _ have succeeded in climbing it.
   From Lukla, the 20-man team hopes to reach Khumbu Glacier, their
planned base camp, by Aug. 26. The Olympics are to begin in Seoul,
South Korea, on Sept. 17.
   ``Once we are acclimatized, we will embark on the mountain,''
said Choi, 45.
   One part of the group is to climb Everest, while another plans
to climb 27,932-foot Mount Lhotse, the world's fourth-highest
mountain and one of Everest's sister peaks.
   If the Korean team reaches both peaks, it would become only the
second expedition to do so, following a Swiss team in 1956.
   ``But they (the Swiss) did not climb the two peaks on the same
day. We will try on the same day,'' said Nam Sun-wu, the team's
climbing leader.
   Ko Sang-don, the first Korean to scale Everest, reached the peak
in 1977. Last year, Heo Young-ho became the second Korean to
conquer the world's highest mountain.
   However, Ko and Heo followed the traditional Southeast Ridge
route that was pioneered by Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing
Norgay in the first climb to Everest's peak in 1953.
   Asked why their team wished to climb Everest, Choi said:
   ``Because it is the highest ... So many people all over the
world have longed to go there. It is a dream of every alpinist to
be on Everest.''

   Space shuttle Discovery roared to
life on the launch pad today as NASA ignited its main engines in a
crucial 22-second test leading up to the first U.S. manned space
mission since the Challenger disaster 2{ years ago.
   NASA officials pronounced the test a success.
   ``It's a clear demonstration that Discovery is a very good
bird,'' Thomas E. Utsman, director of shuttle management, said
after the firing that checked modifications to the engines and
other systems with ground-shaking fury and a V-shaped steam cloud.
   Robert Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations, said a
firm launch date would not be set until the test data is thoroughly
analyzed and a small gas leak in a thruster system discovered
several weeks ago is repaired.
   ``I still think we have a shot at late September,'' Crippen said
at a news conference.
   Crippen said the only question mark today was a possible leak of
nitrogen gas where fuel lines join the external tank. But he also
pronounced the firing a ``a super test'' and said, ``We have seen
nothing today that would delay the march toward launch.''
   The firing, delayed five times in two weeks by leaks and other
mechanical problems, was critical to certifying the shuttle for the
first post-Challenger launch. Many officials believe the liftoff
won't come until October.
   At the end of today's near-flawless countdown, the three main
liquid fuel engines on the delta-winged spaceship flashed to life.
The launch pedestal was engulfed in steam as the fiery exhaust
collided with protective water pouring over the base.
   A thunderclap rolled across the Kennedy Space Center as the
engines, fed by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, generated thrust
equal to the energy output of 23 Hoover Dams.
   ``Super job, super team,'' NASA administrator James C. Fletcher
told the launch team following the test.
   ``It was a very smooth countdown; the team and the hardware all
worked successfully,'' Forrest S. McCartney, director of the
Kennedy Space Center, told the team. ``It's been a long night, but
it sure ended right.''
   The 85-ton spaceship strained against eight 3-foot-long hardened
steel bolts holding it down on the pad. On an actual launch, two
solid fuel booster rockets would ignite and explosive charges would
sever the bolts to free the shuttle.
   A total of 732 instruments were installed throughout the shuttle
to take detailed measurements of all system operations. That's five
times more than on any previous shuttle test or launch.
   The test-firing followed five postponements, including a
computer-ordered halt a split second before ignition last Thursday.
   Launch director Bob Sieck today thanked his crew ``for making
our toughest test look easy. You should be pleased because it was
an excellent performance and you should look forward to the launch
count with confidence.''
   The 22-second burst of power today was just a fraction of the
more than eight minutes that the engines are to burn in propelling
Discovery into orbit. But engineers said the firing was long enough
to test the entire shuttle system.
   ``We'll test the hardware and the software and the people,''
launch director Bob Sieck said before the exercise. ``We want to
demonstrate the readiness of the total system for flight.''
   NASA spokeswoman Cindy Buck said a liquid oxygen pump in ground
support equipment failed early today but crews shifted to a backup
pump. Ignition was on time at 7:30 a.m.
   Two of the engines, which are reuseable, are new. The third has
been flown on three shuttle missions.
   A firing attempt last Thursday was aborted a fraction of a
second before ignition when an electronic sensor erroneously
reported a valve was not closing properly.
   Engineers replaced the valve containing the sensor and made a
computer change to lessen the possibility that a bad signal could
force another shutdown.
   Earlier delays were caused by problems with ground support
equipment.
   Still facing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
is a small gas leak in a steering engine system separate from
Discovery's three main engines. Shuttle managers are expected to
give a go-ahead within a few days to a plan for engineers to cut
through the rear wall of the shuttle's cargo bay to reach and
repair a nitrogen tetroxide leak in a vent valve seal.
   The shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test
before Discovery can be certified for flight: a full-scale
two-minute firing, the fifth in a series, of the redesigned solid
fuel booster rocket. That is scheduled Aug. 18 at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah.
   A faulty booster rocket joint was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed its crew of seven.
   Checked today were modifications to turbopumps, valve actuators,
electronic controllers and other engine systems. Also being tested
were ground support equipment, communications links, new countdown
procedures and personnel.
   Five veteran shuttle fliers have been assigned to the Discovery
mission. During the four-day flight they are to deploy a
communications satellite, conduct experiments and evaluate new
spaceship systems.

<HEAD>Leaders Ask For Delay For Talks With North Korea</HEAD>

   Political leaders said Wednesday they
would not accept North Korean conditions for talks on easing
tension on the Korean peninsula, but would agree to a preliminary
meeting next week.
   Thousands of radical students, meanwhile, clashed with riot
police in Seoul and provincial cities Wednesday, protesting police
actions blocking a cross-country march and talks with North Korean
youths on national unification.
   About 34,000 police were deployed to block demonstrations at
about 30 universities. About 300 students were arrested, but police
said most would be released after questioning.
   Policy-makers of the governing Democratic Justice Party and the
three main opposition parties met with National Assembly Speaker
Kim Chae-sun and proposed that an Aug. 17 meeting sought by North
Korea be delayed by two days.
   ``Our letter stating the points will be sent to North Korea on
Friday,'' Lee Dong-bok, chief secretary to the Assembly speaker,
said after the meeting.
   In a letter sent to South Korea Tuesday, communist North Korea
proposed that a joint meeting of the two countries' legislatures
convene before Sept. 1 to discuss the North's bid to become co-host
of the Olympic Games in Seoul and draft a non-aggression pact.
   North Korea also proposed that a working meeting be held at the
truce site of Panmunjom on Aug. 17, attended by three to five
delegates from each side, to prepare for full parliamentary talks.
   The North Korean letter also demanded the inclusion of
representatives of all walks of life in the proposed parliamentary
talks.
   Seoul officials believe North Korea wants South Korean dissident
groups involved in the talks. The officials criticize the North
Korean demand as implying that South Korea's legislature does not
represent the 41 million people in the South.
   The oficials also said the Aug. 19 working meeting, if held,
should include the agenda, the type of talks and the size of
delegations in full talks.
   North Korea said only logistical arrangements such as
communications and safe passage of delegates traveling to the other
side for talks should be discussed.
   Working parliamentary contacts between the two countries broke
down in 1985.
   South Korean newspapers said the North Korean proposals are
aimed at stirring social unrest before the Olympics, which start
Sept. 17.
   The Chosun Ilbo daily called the joint parliamentary talks
``nothing but a mass rally that can be politically exploited by the
North.''
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics unless its
demand is met to be co-host of the Games. The International Olympic
Committee has rejected the North Korean demand.
   Several thousands radical students staged demonstrations in
Seoul and other parts of the country on Wednesday, protesting a
police blockade of their attempts at a cross-country unification
march.
   The students are calling for talks on Monday with North Korean
youths at Panmunjom on national unification. An attempt by students
to march to Panmunjom was blocked by police on June 10.

   The accident occurred earlier this week near the town of
Kachola, about 165 miles east of the capital, the official Zambia

   Cuban jails where political prisoners have
been kept naked in windowless rooms are being altered to make them
appear more humane to outside investigators, a U.S. human rights
official said Wednesday.
   Ambassador Armando Valladares, U.S. representative to the U.N.
Human Rights Commission, made the accusation and released
photographs of prisoners and their cells he said were smuggled out
of one prison by Cuban dissidents.
   Valladares, who himself was a prisoner of Cuban leader Fidel
Castro for 22 years before he was released in 1982 and allowed to
emigrate to the United States, said some of the worst jail cells
have been dismantled in a prison near Havana but others remain in
more than 200 jails throughout the country.
   ``Real changes are not possible, because that would mean the end
of the dictatorship,'' said Valladares, speaking in Spanish through
a translator. He was appointed to the Geneva-based human rights
commission by President Reagan earlier this year. Castro expressed
outrage at the appointment, labeling Valladares a terrorist.
   The photos showed a wall of windowless metal doors and the
interior of dank cells with hole-in-the-floor toilets. Valladares
said the cells, including one dubbed ``the triangle of death,''
were all torn down shortly after the pictures were taken.
   He pointed out welding equipment used in the destruction in one
of the photos and displayed two tiny microphones he said were also
smuggled out by prisoners.
   Inmates from a group known as the Ricardo Bofill's Cuban
Committee for Human Rights took the pictures at the Combinado del
Este prison on the outskirts of Havana using a Soviet-made camera
using Chinese film, Valladares said.
   A United Nations delegation headed by Alioune Sene of Senegal is
to visit Cuba in September. Other members of the delegation will be
representatives from Ireland, Nigeria, Hungary, Colombia and the
Philippines.
   Valladares said the commission expects to interview hundreds of
Cubans during an 11-day trip. He said the Cuban government was
supposed to publish three telephone numbers that people can call
who want to present information to the commission.
   The commission also has a list of 5,000 names of people to make
inquiries about, Valladares said. ``Many Cubans are becoming less
and less afraid and will be willing to talk to the commission,'' he
said.
   He said delegation members have been assured they will have
freedom to move around the country and interview anyone.
   Valladares acknowledged it may be difficult to prove that
prisoners are tortured, because government's don't generally
acknowledge such activities. He said the photos of prison cells and
inmates have been sent to the delegation.

   The space shuttle Discovery
flawlessly fired its three huge engines Wednesday and demonstrated
it is ready to carry Americans into space for the first time since
Challenger exploded 2{ years ago.
   ``We proved it works,'' Robert Crippen, deputy director of
shuttle operations, said after the engines spewed 6,000-degree
flames for 22 seconds. ``We really had a super test. We have seen
nothing today that would delay the march toward launch.''
   The first mission might still be possible in late September,
said an elated Forrest S. McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space
Center. Wednesday's flight readiness test had been postponed five
times previously, leading to expectations that Discovery might not
fly until October or later.
   ``Super job, super team,'' NASA administrator James C. Fletcher
told the launch team.
   Thomas E. Utsman, director of shuttle management, called the
test ``a clear demonstration that Discovery is a very good bird.''
   The only question mark was a possible leak of nitrogen gas in an
area where fuel lines join the external tank, Crippen said. The gas
was detected by instruments that had not been there before and
engineers were not certain the readings indicated something new.
   Asked how he felt, with the hot-fire test out of the way,
Crippen replied: ``You can't have a major milestone like that come
out as clean as it was and not feel good about it.''
   Setting of a firm launch date for Discovery awaited analysis of
Wednesday's test and repairs to a small gas leak in a thruster
system that was not involved in the test.
   ``I still think we have a shot at late September,'' Crippen said.
   The engine firing was a crucial step for resuming space flight.
   ``It is an opportunity to assess the readiness of the launch
team, the ground support equipment and flight hardware,'' said
National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Hugh
Harris, reporting on the progress of the test. ``It provides
another measure of the readiness of people and hardware for launch
after many months of assessing and improving the entire shuttle
program.''
   Two other big hurdles stand between Discovery and its four-day
mission with five astronauts: a full-scale test of a redesigned
booster rocket and the sealing of a gas vent line in the shuttle's
space maneuvering system. The second task will require cutting a
hole in Discovery's cargo bay for access.
   The shuttle, its huge fuel tank and two flanking solid rocket
boosters were bolted to the pad during Wednesday's test as its
engines were started in a 3-2-1 sequence separated by 120
milliseconds. During a launch, the engines fire more than eight
minutes, with the boosters providing a powerful assist during the
first two minutes of flight.
   Discovery, which has flown in space six times, was treated as an
untried ship in having to undergo the flight readiness firing. A
total of 732 instruments, five times more than on any previous
shuttle test or launch, were installed throughout the shuttle stack
to take detailed measurements of all system operations.
   The test took special note of the strains placed on the booster
rockets as the engines reached full power. The Challenger exploded
while lifting off on Jan. 28, 1986, because of a leak in a joint on
the right booster, near its attachment point on the fuel tank.
   The shuttle fleet, now numbering three, has undergone numerous
design changes since the accident which killed the seven-member
crew. The orbiter alone has had 220 design changes, the boosters
145, and each of the main engines 30.
   Just before ignition, water poured into the flame trough beneath
the shuttle at the rate of more than 100,000 gallons a minute. When
the fire hit the water, a huge cloud of steam rose toward the sky,
forming a ``V'' that must have seemed a symbol of victory for
firing room personnel who had agonized through the five
postponements.
   The huge stack, 18 stories high, strained against the holddown
bolts, 3.5 inches in diameter and 28 inches long. During a launch,
the nuts to those bolts would be exploded apart to release the ship.
   The engines built up to 1.1 million pounds of thrust in the
first 6.6 seconds, the energy output of 23 Hoover Dams, and a
thunderclap rolled across the launch site.
   The countdown had only one problem. A liquid oxygen pump in
ground support equipment failed and crews shifted to a backup pump.
   Two of Discovery's reusable engines are new. The third has been
used on four shuttle missions.
   A firing attempt Aug. 4 was aborted a fraction of a second
before ignition when an electronic sensor erroneously reported a
valve was not closing properly. Engineers replaced the valve
containing the sensor and made a computer change to lessen the
possibility that a bad signal could force another shutdown.
   The earlier delays were caused by problems with ground support
equipment.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Regulations to Reduce Lead in Drinking Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency today
proposed new regulations to reduce levels of lead in the nation's
drinking water supply, a move that would curb exposure to a metal
that can cause mental retardation in children and high blood
pressure in adults.
   ``This proposal will reduce lead in the drinking water of 138
million Americans and will be especially beneficial to young
children, who are at much greater risk than adults,'' EPA
Administrator Lee M. Thomas said in a statement.
   The proposed rules would require as many as 53,000 public
drinking water supply systems in the country to treat water so that
it does not pick up as much lead and to participate in public
education programs, the EPA said.
   EPA spokesman Dave Ryan said there was no precise date for the
start-up of the new program because the rules must be published in
the Federal Register. Interested parties will then be allowed to
comment on the proposals.
   But Ryan said Congress has given the government a deadline of
June 1989 to do something about lead levels. In 1986, Congress
amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to deal with lead.
   High concentrations of lead in the blood have been associated
with a variety of health problems. For example, lead can impair
mental ability in children, cause premature births, delay physical
and mental development of babies, cause kidney damage, interfere
with hearing and increase blood pressure in adults.
   EPA said the new regulations could cause the blood-lead levels
of as many as 700,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5
years to fall below 10 to 15 milligrams per deciliter, the range
above which adverse health effects begin.
   The EPA regulations call for several steps:
   _ Munipalities with lead levels greater than 10 parts per
billion would be required to treat water at the plants to reduce
its acidity. Acidity is an indicator of corrosive water, which
causes pipes to leach lead before it reaches the consumer's tap.
   _ If the average lead levels are greater than 10 parts per
billion, water suppliers must conduct a public education program,
which would include helping consumers get their water tested.
   _ Water suppliers would have to reduce lead to a maximum
contaminant level of 5 parts per billion.
   EPA said the annual cost of the proposal is about $267 million.
But it said the corrosion-control requirements for water could
prolong the life of plumbing and pipes.
   Marion Sills, a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund, a
group that has lobbied against lead, called EPA's proposals a
``good first tier'' of a program to reduce lead.

<HEAD>Teller Says Fission Still Mainstay of Nuclear Energy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should move ahead with
development of advanced uranium-fueled reactors because producing
electrical power from hydrogen fusion is at least several decades
away, physicist Edward Teller said Wednesday.
   Teller, who played a key role in development of the hydrogen
bomb, told a scientific conference that ``fusion will have no
impact on electric generation during the next 40 years.''
   He said that ``at least for the next 50 years _ and much longer,
in my opinion _ the mainstay of nuclear energy ... I firmly believe
will be fission.''
   Fission, which provides the basis for all of today's nuclear
power reactors, involves the splitting of uranium atoms in a
controlled chain reaction. Fusion derives energy from the fusing
together of hydrogen nuclei under very high temperature and
pressure.
   Teller said accelerated development of nuclear power will be
prompted partly by increasing concern over the ``greenhouse
effect'' _ global warming caused by atmospheric buildup of carbon
dioxide and other gases from the burning of fossil fuels.
   Because of this and other factors, he said, the United States
``must greatly increase the funding for power reactor development.''
   Advanced fission reactor concepts under study in the United
States include high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors along with
units that would utilize liquid sodium metal as the reactor coolant.
   Also appearing at the conference was Dixy Lee Ray, former
governor of Washington and former chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission.
   Asked how she would assess the prospects for achieving
controlled nuclear fusion, Ray said in an interview: ``I think it
is a program that we must support and must continue. I believe
there's a great deal of basic research that still needs to be
done.''
   ``It's awfully hard to make predictions, but based on experience
in other areas I'd say it's another 10 to 20 years before we can
know for sure whether it will work,'' she said. ``And once we know
it works, then it's another time to know whether it will be
economical, which is still an open question.''

<TEXT>
   Austria is coming under increasing
financial pressure to curtail its postwar role as a haven for
refugees from neighboring Communist states.
   The increasing influx of people seeking asylum in the West is
stirring concern over how much more money neutral Austria can spend
on five main refugee camps and dozens of government-rented hotels
and boarding houses.
   The number of would-be refugees from Poland and Hungary has
exploded since the countries loosened travel restrictions earlier
this year. The number of Eastern defectors is expected to double
this year from about 11,400 in 1987.
   Since regaining independence in 1955, Austria has prided itself
on being a refuge for the oppressed.
   But Austrian authorities are warning new arrivals to think
carefully before applying for refugee status. Some might even be
deported.
   In July, 66 Poles went on a hunger strike and six who refused to
leave after their applications had been rejected were held for a
week in custody, later escorted by Austrian police to the Czech
border and expelled.
   ``Such a brutal incident has never before occurred here,'' said
lawyer Eva Maria Barki, who appealed the deportation decision.
   But Austria now has 20,000 recognized political refugees, as
well as about 15,000 people seeking asylum. Both groups are
supported by the government.
   In 1983, Austria spent $20 million on refugees. This year's
budget is expected to total $82 million.
   In July, a Polish travel agent drove three busloads of Poles
from the Czech border to the Traiskirchen refugee camp south of
Vienna. Each passenger asked for political asylum.
   Alexander Hirschfeld, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said the
number of Poles seeking asylum has risen from 126 in the first half
of 1987 to 2,271 for the same period this year.
   On May 9, the government instituted new rules that reduced the
handling procedure for those seeking asylum from months to three
days, with the option of appealing within 14 days.
   Romanian and Czechoslovak refugees, who arrive in comparatively
smaller numbers, are not covered by the new rules.
   Hirschfeld said 90 percent of the Poles and Hungarians seeking
asylum don't qualify as refugees under the Geneva convention
because they cannot prove political persecution or other personal
hardships at home.
   But Poles claim Poland still suffers from political repression.
   Hungarians and Poles are given a leaflet, suggesting they
reconsider their decision to defect. It says the chances of
obtaining permission to immigrate to a third country are slim and
require long waits.
   ``Please consider very carefully whether you really want to turn
your back on your homeland considering the above-mentioned
circumstances,'' the leaflet says.
   Interior Minister Karl Blecha has said 96 percent of the Poles
and Hungarians want to go to the United States, Canada and
Australia.
   But he said their chances are declining because Soviet Jews and
Soviet Armenians often are given priority. Blecha said this year
about 6,000 Armenians, 4,500 Soviet Jews and 1,500 Iranian Jews
were expected to arrive in Austria on their way to the United
States.
   But Hirschfeld said an East European must wait an average 18
months until his U.S. immigration papers are approved, compared
with six to 10 months before.
   ``The easiest route (for East European refugees) to go to the
West is Austria,'' Hirschfeld said, ``but it's not the easiest one
when they want to go farther.''

   Five Palestinians sentenced to hang
for the 1986 hijacking of a Pan Am jumbo jet that left 21 people
dead appealed their death sentences Wednesday in a petition to
Superior Court.
   The five were convicted and sentenced July 6 by Judge Mohammad
Zafar Barbar in a makeshift courtroom in a prison west of Islamabad.
   The judge blamed lax airport security in part for the hijacking,
in which four of the Palestinians entered the plane dressed as
security guards.
   An Indian-American was among the 21 people who died during the
hijacking ordeal, and 200 people were injured.
   The Boeing 747 on a stopover between Bombay, India, and New
York, was seized on the ground Sept. 5, 1986, in Pakistan's
southern port of Karachi with 400 people aboard, including 44
Americans.
   It sat on the tarmac for 17 hours before the Palestinians,
fearing an attack when an onboard generator ran out, sprayed the
cabin with bullets and hurled hand grenades, and Pakistani troops
stormed the plane.
   The defendants said they were innocent and blamed the killings
on Pakistani commandos.
   The hijackers claimed they planned to free their hostages and
blow the plane up over Israel in a suicide operation that would
highlight ``Israeli excesses'' against Palestinians in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In their appeal, the Palestinians challenged Judge Barbar's
legal interpretation of hijacking laws. They also asked the
Superior Court to have their fetters removed and to guarantee them
proper medical care in prison.
   The court will take up the petition on Aug. 15. The death
sentences will not be carried until all appeals have been
exhausted, which could take months.
   When the guilty verdict was returned, Mohammad Hafiz Turk, 32,
the only one of the five who was not on the hijacked plane, said:
``We don't care about the sentence.'' He was sentenced to hang for
his part in planning the hijacking. ``We care only about the
millions of Arabs and Islamic countries.''
   The other four _ Mohammad Ahmed Munawar, Khalil Hussain Rahayyal
and Saeed Abdul Rahim of Lebanon, and Abdul Latif Sairfani of Syria
_ were sentenced to hang for their role in the hijacking.
   They also were sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences or 250
years in prison for the deaths of 10 of the 21 passengers.
   Three of the four men received an additional life sentence in an
11th death, that of the Indian-American.
   The four men, ranging in age from 18-24, also were fined nearly
$2,800 in each murder conviction. Half the money will be given to
relatives of victims.
   During sentencing, Barbar said ``security (at the airport)
seemed to be extremely lax.'' The judge questioned how the four men
dressed as security guards could board the Pan Am flight weighed
down with weapons and ammunition.
   The hijackers, he said, ``were able to collect huge caches of
ammunition unnoticed and unhindered.''

   A typhoon that slammed into an eastern province
killed 110 people and destroyed bridges, dams and ships in the
worst economic loss from a storm in China in 30 years, press
reports said Wednesday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 81 people were missing and
1,184 were injured after the typhoon hit Zhejiang province Monday
with 75 mph winds.
   The China News Service said in a report monitored in Hong Kong
that 144,500 homes were destroyed and estimated losses at $270
million.
   Xinhua said the storm brought an average of 2 inches of rain
over a four-hour period, with one area recording nearly 11 inches.
   It said 155 bridges collapsed, 27 miles of dikes and dams were
washed away and 1,048 ships were destroyed.
   Wednesday's overseas edition of The People's Daily said 22 main
throughfares were blocked by fallen trees in the scenic city of
Hangzhou, the provincial capital.
   Nearly 10,000 French firmiana trees in Hangzhou's scenic
district near West Lake were uprooted, the paper said.
   A Western reporter in the city said all the trees were blown
down around West Lake, a major tourist attraction and a source of
inspiration to Chinese painters and poets for hundreds of years.
   The Liberation Daily said 279 boats were destroyed off the
coastal city of Ningbo.
   Monday's disaster marked the third time this year Zhejiang
province has been hit by a major storm. On July 30, a flash flood
killed 264 people.
   The official China Daily said the central government will
increase its relief aid to areas hit by natural disasters.
   The report said that $142 million has been allocated to areas
affected by floods, droughts and other natural disasters.
   Severe droughts have hit Anhui, Henan and Hubei, three central
Chinese provinces, destroying much of their autumn crop.
   Flooding in northern Heilongjiang province has inundated about
40 percent of all its cultivated areas, the China Daily said.
Floods also hit Shanxi province this week, killing 49 people and
leaving 10 missing.
   More than 800 people have died in floods this year in China.

   Demonstrators in Burma beheaded three
policemen today and troops in the capital opened fire on
anti-government protesters, killing more than 30 people, Radio
Rangoon said.
   The Burmese government-owned radio also said a mob attacked a
police station in Moulmein in southern Burma, killing one officer.
   Burma has reported 78 deaths, about 160 people wounded and more
than 1,500 arrests in three days of protests against the
authoritarian government of President Sein Lwin.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon, the capital, believe casualties
are substantially higher.
   Radio Rangoon, monitored in Bangkok, said security forces fired
15 times to disperse crowds in Rangoon. It said 33 people were
killed, 59 were wounded and 113 were arrested for ``violence and
looting.''
   The radio said three policemen were beheaded and another member
of the security forces and a civilian were killed in outlying areas
of the capital. It was not clear if the five were included in the
report of 33 deaths in Rangoon.
   It said another officer was taken away by a mob outside the
capital.
   In Moulmein, on the southern coast, demonstrators seized guns
from police firing to disperse them, marched to the police station
and fatally shot one policeman, the radio said.
   It said rioters set fire to buses, police stations and
government family quarters, destroyed railway lines and burned
other buildings in and around Rangoon.
   Japan's Kyodo News Agency said more than 100 people were killed
and nearly 1,000 wounded today when troops fired machine guns and
automatic weapons at the protesters in Rangoon.
   Diplomats in Rangoon and Bangkok, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said up to 200 may have been killed in three days of
protests but that access to reliable information has been difficult.
   In Washington today, State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said the United States has temporarily closed its embassy in
Burma. All official American personnel and their dependents _ a
total of 154 people _ are safe at their homes, she said.
   Mrs. Oakley was unable to say when the embassy was closed but
she said that there is no indication Americans or other foreigners
have been or might become targets of violence. She said it appeared
the anti-government demonstrations have led to a ``substantial''
loss of life.
   Burmese embassies around the world stopped issuing tourist visas
this week and have been expelling some visitors before the
expiration of their seven-day visas.
   ``They're flushing everyone from the country,'' said one British
tourist returning to Bangkok. Other travelers said they were
interrogated and jailed and several appeared near shock.
   A curfew was imposed in the capital Tuesday and gatherings of
more than five people were banned.
   ``The government hasn't gotten control of the situation yet,''
said a Bangkok-based diplomat monitoring developments in Burma.
   Most embassies in the city were staffed by only essential
personnel, with many Burmese employees staying home, the diplomats
said. One said the capital was ``half-operating,'' with a number of
stores closed and only some public transport running.
   The demonstrations _ the largest public protests since a
military coup in 1962 _ began last month shortly after Sein Lwin
became both president of the country and chairman of its sole
political party.
   Sein Lwin has been accused by students and other demonstrators
of ruthless suppression of dissent. He replaced Ne Win, who
resigned after ruling Burma for 26 years and imposing isolationist
economic policies.
   An Italian journalist of Florence's La Nazione newspaper said he
saw a large but peaceful protest Monday turn violent around the
Sule Pagoda in downtown Rangoon.
   The reporter, who asked that his name not be used, said at least
30,000 demonstrators converged on the pagoda, with students and
Buddhist monks climbing on columns and other high places to give
speeches and chant slogans denouncing Sein Lwin and demanding a
return to democracy.
   ``When the monks got up to speak there was an explosion of
clapping, an intense, emotional ovation,'' he said.
   Troops moved in and warned they would shoot if the crowd did not
leave, he said. Thousands scattered but many more remained in
place, and when troops approached, youngsters would lie
spread-eagled on the ground to stop their advance, the reporter
said.
   Before midnight, he said, more troops arrived, some in armored
personnel carriers, and sealed off the area, setting up barricades
along all streets leading to the pagoda.
   He said the troops then opened fire, first in the air and then
apparently into the crowd. The journalist said he saw people topple
over and flags they were holding sink to the ground. He said he
watched from an upstairs room of a building in which he was given
shelter.
   ``I didn't see a single weapon, not even a stick in the hands of
the demonstrators,'' he said. ``Some had flags and the Buddhist
monks carried their umbrellas.''
   A U.S. official in Washington said eyewitnesses reported seeing
demonstrators carrying bodies of dead colleagues over their heads
as they marched through the streets of Rangoon.
   Consular officials around the world have in recent weeks tried
to screen journalists attempting to enter the country under tourist
visas.
   The Associated Press has been unable to obtain entry. Its
correspondent in Rangoon, Sein Win, was arrested and jailed by
authorities late last month. No charges were filed.

   A Leningrad teacher whose March letter in an
official newspaper touched off an intense debate about Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms reappeared in print Wednesday to answer her
critics.
   A letter from Nina Andreeva to actor Mikhail Ulyanov, answering
his speech to the Communist Party conference at the end of June,
appeared in the weekly Moscow News.
   Ms. Andreeva's March 13 letter to the newspaper Sovietskaya
Rossiya was regarded by Gorbachev supporters as a rallying point
for conservatives opposed to the Soviet leader's reforms.
   But her latest letter was less a manifesto of the Soviet right
than a personal rebuke to the actor.
   Rumors circulating in Moscow claimed that Kremlin No. 2 leader
Yegor K. Ligachev, thought to be more conservative than Gorbachev,
was behind the publication and was seeking to undermine Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Ulyanov said in his passionate speech to the conference, which
was called to review progress on the reforms and chart a future
path, that supporters of Gorbachev did not have to answer Ms.
Andreeva directly but ``those who stand behind her.''
   He said Soviets remain afraid to act because of their society's
history of repression.
   Ms. Andreeva chided the actor on his passionate language and
offered to meet him in Leningrad ``to debate those things that so
upset you.''
   Moscow News, which has used Gorbachev's policy of greater
freedom on selected topics to publish much material that previously
would not have been printed, said Ulyanov did not intend to take
Ms. Andreeva up on the offer.

   For Jodie Foster, who got her first acting job
at age 3, college at Yale University was supposed to be her time to
live a normal life.
   Then, in March 1981, John Hinckley shot President Reagan, saying
he wanted to impress Foster, the teen-age prostitute of ``Taxi
Driver,'' whom he'd never met.
   ``It was a surreal experience,'' Foster recalls in the September
issue of Vanity Fair.
   ``In general, I felt it was my God-given responsibility to
endure this martyrdom, and it's a good thing I went through it,
because somebody else couldn't take it. ... I got applause for
being professional and not complaining and being straightforward
and strong _ I didn't get any attention for crying.''
   The 25-year-old actress, who plays a gang-rape victim in the
upcoming film, ``The Accused,'' with Kelly McGillis, says she has
been thinking about moving out from in front of the camera to
direct ``a real film about real people. A very American film about
relationships and disappointments.''
   ``I don't believe that winning makes you more mature,'' she
says. ``I'm not sure I like it, but disappointments shape you.''

   A state appeals court has ruled there is ``clear
and convincing proof'' that comedian Jackie Mason fathered the
daughter of actress and playwright Ginger Reiter.
   The Third District Court of Appeal on Tuesday upheld a lower
court decision issued earlier this year by Dade Circuit Judge John
Gale.
   The appeals panel noted that a blood test showed a 99.94 percent
probability that Mason, 57, was the father of the toddler, Sheba.
It also pointed to a ``striking resemblance between the father and
the 2{-year-old child.''
   The judges also found proof that ``the parties had an ongoing
sexual relationship during the period of conception.''
   Mason's attorney Gerald Mager said he would have to review the
decision before deciding whether to appeal.
   While the appeal was pending, Mason began paying Ms. Reiter
$1,500 a month in temporary child support, plus a payment of $2,550
to move Ms. Reiter and her daughter to another apartment.
   If the appeals court ruling stands, the case will be sent back
to Gale to determine permanent child support.
   Mason is featured in his own Broadway show and in the movie
Caddyshack II.
   Ms. Reiter, 37, of North Miami Beach, has mounted her own show,
``Oh Jackie, Oh!'' about their relationship. The show has toured
community centers in south Florida.

   A CBS television movie starring Robert Urich
as a former college football star will be shot on the University of
Minnesota campus starting next month, the school says.
   ``The Comeback'' is about an old Gopher star who returns to
Minneapolis to start a new life in his old town. The movie is
scheduled to be shown in November.
   Some real-life ex-Minnesota football players may appear, but
National Collegiate Athletic Association rules forbid current
players from taking part.
   ``Everybody in the athletic department wants a part in the
movie,'' said Dana Noel, an assistant to the sports information
director. Noel is helping CBS line up some of the extras for the
movie.
   Real-life former players will portray present players in a scene
where the nostalgic ex-star watches his old team practice.
   Tentative plans call for CBS to make a contribution to the
athletic department instead of paying the extras, Noel said.

   Former President Carter and two
of his sons made it to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's
highest mountain, but Rosalynn Carter and three of the Carters'
grandchildren dropped out of the climb.
   The 64-year-old Carter, leading a 17-member party through snow
flurries and near-zero visibility, reached the volcanic mountain's
second highest peak, Gilman's Point, early Monday after a three-day
climb.
   Reaching Gilman's Point at 18,640 feet traditionally is
considered a successful climb, although the 19,340-foot Uhuru Peak
farther around the summit's crater is the mountain's highest point.
   There were eight dropouts, including Mrs. Carter and
grandchildren Jason, 13, James Early, 12, and Sarah, 10.
   Tanzania's president, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, will present
certificates to Carter and his sons, Jack, 41, and Jim ``Chip'',
38, at a ceremony marking the climb Sunday in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania's capital, according to the government-owned Daily News.
   The group left Wednesday for four days of viewing wildlife in
Tangire, Manyara, Serengeti and the Ngorongoro Crater national
parks. After stopping back in Dar Es Salaam, they will go on to
Kenya.

   Everybody complains that their taxes are too
high, but hundreds of York County residents really had something to
gripe about.
   More than 400 people received personal property tax bills this
week in excess of $1 million, including one woman hit with a $21
million tab, officials said.
   The error affected about 5 percent of 8,000 property owners and
kept assessment office phones ringing for two days.
   ``Most of the problems have been addressed, and we've been
sending out the correction notices,'' said chief assessor Steve
Anderson. ``They can leave their bombs at home.''
   The annual tax bills cover personal property, such as stocks and
other investments.
   Anderson blamed the mix-up on new employees in the personal
property tax division entering data incorrectly on a new computer
system.
   ``A person who had one share _ or $500 _ was in some cases
listed as having 500 shares,'' he said. ``So that person would be
taxed on $250,000 when he really should have been taxed on $500.
   County Commissioner Ron Fitzkee called the clerical error ``a
shame,'' but said the bills were so outrageous that most people
didn't take them seriously.

   Roland Winbeckler's art looks good enough to
eat. But maybe that's because he puts on his palette the things
that please most palates.
   His decorations adorn Styrofoam and cardboard forms; his palette
holds buttercream frosting.
   Winbeckler, 42, of Kent, Wash., is one of more than 1,000 cake
decorators and vendors who will be in Tulsa for the International
Cake Exploration Society's 13th annual convention, Thursday through
Sunday.
   Winbeckler's creation is a foot-tall bust of Oklahoma humorist
Will Rogers, with carefully sculpted features that include
straggling gray hair on the forehead and the twist of his familiar
grin.
   It's all done with the frosting, said Winbeckler, who has
created life-size and edible likenesses of Marilyn Monroe taming a
billowing dress, Wayne Gretzky wielding a hockey stick, and
Princess Diana standing ready in her wedding dress for her marriage
to Prince Charles.
   Winbeckler's Rogers is part of a 9-foot-high Styrofoam and
frosting representation of Oklahoma history made by the Oklahomans
sponsoring the convention. It is topped by an oil derrick and has a
motorized ring of covered wagons depicting the Land Run of 1889,
when unassigned areas of land in the state were opened to white
settlement.
   It's not uncommon for cake decorators showing off their talents
to use Styrofoam forms, Winbeckler explained, particularly when the
display has to last more than a day or two.
   For his edible creations, Winbeckler prefers a dense pound cake
as his medium. ``It usually is more solid than white cake and will
hold up better,'' he said.

   One good turn deserves another, so this
small community is raising money to repay a Canadian disc jockey
who raised $12,000 to buy Portage a new police car.
   Radio station WWML owner Bill Henderson began the fund drive
Tuesday for Scruff Connors of St. Catharines, Ontario.
   The CHTZ-FM disc jockey was hospitalized while in Johnstown on
Friday after becoming ill at a restaurant. He hoped to be released
Tuesday but collapsed during a stress test and was scheduled for
heart treatment in Pittsburgh.
   ``First we wanted to raise money for his medical bills,''
Henderson said. ``But he said he didn't want that. We thought it
was a good idea to repay him for the loan he took out.''
   Connors, 20, took a personal loan to contribute to the patrol
car fund, which he organized after hearing that Portage was using a
dump truck for police patrols.

   Conservative lawmakers led by Rep. Philip
Crane, R-Ill., and Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, introduced a bill
Wednesday urging abrogation of the 1979 treaty transferring
ownership of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government.
   Crane said the treaty is invalid because it was not ratified
properly.
   He said the Constitution prohibits transfer of U.S. property
unless both houses of Congress approve, but that the House never
voted on the canal treaty.
   Symms said the treaty also is invalid because the Senate never
ratified changes imposed by the Panamanian government in 1979 and
because it was not signed by the president of Panama.
   The two lawmakers said their resolution urges the president or
Congress ``to simply announce the abrogation of the treaty.''
   Under the treaty, the United States would abandon all rights to
the Canal Zone and it would become a part of Panama on Dec. 31,
1999.

   The man convicted of strangling a young woman in
the ``preppie murder'' case said he will not fight a $25 million
judgment to be entered against him on behalf of the parents of the
slain teen-ager.
   ``My only wish is for the nightmare to end,'' Robert Chambers
said in a handwritten note dated Tuesday. He asked the court to
enter the judgment against him because ``I do not wish the Levins
to endure any more pain.''
   Steven and Ellen Levin, parents of Jennifer Levin, 18, filed the
wrongful death lawsuit against Chambers on July 22. On Monday they
sued Jack Dorrian, owner of the bar where Miss Levin and Chambers
drank hours before he strangled her in Central Park on Aug. 26,
1986.
   Chambers' request for the default judgment was filed in the
trial-level state Supreme Court on his behalf by his attorney,
Brian O'Dwyer, who said he had advised his client against the move.
   O'Dwyer said he explained to Chambers that all his property
could be attached and sold to satisfy the judgment, and that any
future salary, property, gift or inheritance he receives also could
be attached.
   But O'Dwyer said Chambers, 21, ``hoped this action might be seen
to others as a symbol of the genuine sorrow he felt about the death
of Jennifer Levin, and he knew it would live with him every day and
every hour of his life.''
   The Levins could not be reached for comment. Arnold Domenitz,
Miss Levin's maternal grandfather, refused to comment on Chambers'
action.
   Harry Lipsig, the Levins' attorney, called the action ``a ploy,
an attempt to save himself from the grilling that would necessarily
take place in connection with the suit and the ultimate proof of
all his misconduct.''
   Lipsig called Chambers' default a victory for the Levins, but a
``pathetic'' one because, ``Nothing can bring back the flower he
crushed.''
   Chambers wrote the note at Great Meadows Correctional Facility,
a maximum-security prison in Comstock, where he is serving a
five-to-15-year sentence after pleading guilty to first-degree
manslaughter in Miss Levin's death.
   Despite his Upper East Side residence and prep school education,
Chambers is not wealthy. His mother made about $70,000 last year as
a 12-hour-a-day private duty nurse, and his father is an accounts
receivable employee who earned less than $40,000.
   O'Dwyer mentioned in the court papers that Chambers has applied
to take college courses in the fall at prison. Chambers hopes to
become a teacher when he gets out, O'Dwyer said.

   The Democrats had Garrison Keillor, Lynda
Carter and Dionne Warwick, and the Republicans will fight back next
week with Charlton Heston, Sandy Patti and the Oak Ridge Boys.
   Political conventions may be serious business, but so is
prime-time television _ a fact not lost on the organizers of the
upcoming GOP parley in the New Orleans Superdome.
   ``It's no secret that a great deal of what you do is designed
for television. We are trying to reach the public here,'' says Mark
Goode, a Washington consultant and former television producer who
is producing the convention.
   A primary task of GOP planners has been to turn the 27-story
high, 87,000-seat sports arena into a smaller, warmer setting,
unmarred by banks of empty seats or cubic yards of empty air.
   Last month at the Democratic National Convention, conditions
were so crowded that legitimate delegates were shut out and the
Atlanta fire marshal was on alert all week.
   The Republicans, by contrast, have hung an enormous blue curtain
across the middle of the Superdome, cutting it in half. And they've
hung an equally imposing lighting grid 40 feet above the floor,
which ``reduces the normally cavernous feel in here,'' Goode said.
   ``It is a massive place. But it will certainly appear far more
intimate than under normal circumstances,'' Goode said. ``Had we
not felt it was suitable for television, we never would have chosen
it. It's going to work just fine for television and sensationally
for the people who will be right here. It will be very exciting _
the largest crowd ever for a political convention.''
   The Democrats hired a Hollywood production company to
orchestrate their convention, a much more theatrical spectacle than
the party usually puts on.
   Goode, who lived in Los Angeles for 24 years, is no stranger to
Hollywood production values. Nevertheless, the Republicans, known
in the past for their smooth stagecraft, are sniffing in scorn at
the Democrats' pandering to the entertainment ethic.
   ``This is not a variety show,'' said GOP convention spokeswoman
Mary Mead. ``The emphasis is on substance, not glitz.''
   ``We'll have a little fun, some excitement and some color,''
Goode said. ``But basically we are here to do business.''
   The convention will kick off Monday with a tribute to President
Reagan, including a videotape to be shown on eight huge screens
throughout the New Orleans Superdome. Before Reagan's appearance,
``we have a little surprise cooked up,'' Goode said. He would not
elaborate.
   Celebrities will be sprinkled throughout prime time, with
musician Lionel Hampton and actor Charlton Heston scheduled to lead
the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem to be sung on
various evenings by gospel singer Sandy Patti, soap star Shelley
Burch, the Oak Ridge Boys and a 10-year-old girl from Seattle.
   The rest of prime time will be dominated by Republican
officeholders, including a large number of women. Rep. Olympia
Snowe of Maine will help preside over the convention while Rep. Pat
Saiki of Hawaii will call the roll of the states when George Bush
is nominated.
   Other prime time speeches are tentatively scheduled for former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, former U.N. Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Nebraska Gov.
Kay Orr, chairman of the platform committee.
   Bush has the nomination sewn up, but he's hoping to build
suspense _ and ratings _ by keeping his vice presidential choice a
secret until Thursday, the final day of the convention.
   Delegates will be sitting in armchairs upholstered in red, part
of a traditional red-white-blue color scheme and unlike the salmon
and azure favored by the Democrats. Forty skyboxes will ring the
arena at the height of its third floor, and four anchor booths will
be in place for ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN.
   Some 13,500 journalists and technicians are expected to attend
the Republican convention, along with 50 to 60 satellite trucks
sent by TV stations and groups seeking localized coverage.
   The RNC is offering gavel-to-gavel coverage of the convention
via the RNC Network to any station that can pick up a satellite
feed. The proceedings will be accompanied by closed captioning and
a simultaneous Spanish translation.

   President Reagan, saying ``we admit a wrong,''
today signed into law legislation providing $20,000 payments to
Japanese-Americans kept in U.S. internment camps during the early
stages of World War II.
   Reagan, during a signing ceremony in an auditorium of the Old
Executive Office Building next to the White House, noted that some
120,000 Americans of Japanese descent ``were forcibly removed from
their homes and placed in makeshift internment camps.''
   He said the action was taken by the U.S. government ``without
trial and without jury. It was based solely on race.''
   ``Yes, the nation then was at war,'' he said, ``and it's not for
us to pass judgment today on those who may have made mistakes. ...
But we must recognize that the internment of Japanese-Americans was
just that _ a mistake.''
   Reagan said the time was long overdue to ``right a grave wrong.''
   He said that ``scores of Japanese-Americans volunteered for our
armed forces'' and that the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, made up
entirely of Japanese-Americans, served with immense distinction.
   ``The legislation provides for a restitution payment to each of
the 60,000 survivors,'' Reagan said. ``Yet no payment can make up
for those lost years, so what's most important in this bill has
less to do with property than with honor. For here, we admit a
wrong.''
   ``I think it's a fine day,'' he said.
   In addition to providing $20,000 in tax-free payments to each
survivor, the legislation includes an official U.S. government
apology for having forced some 120,000 Japanese-Americans, both
citizens and resident aliens, from their homes and jobs following
the Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,
on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The payments will begin in about a year, and will total about
$1.25 billion. The administration initially had balked at the
amount of money to be committed, although saying it agreed with the
concept of reparations and an apology.
   Individual payments to the surviving internees will be made over
a 10-year period, with the most elderly getting priority treatment.
   In return for the money, those who qualify must agree to drop
any legal claims against the government stemming from the
internment.

<HEAD>Customs Agents Seizing More Drugs Every Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs Service agents in 10 months have
seized 10 tons more cocaine than they did in all of the last fiscal
year, but officials said Wednesday the bad news was that there was
more cocaine to seize.
   ``This is one of those good news-bad news situations,'' Customs
Commissioner William von Raab said in announcing that agents had
stopped a record 108,843 pounds of cocaine from being sold on
America's streets since the fiscal year began last Oct. 1.
   ``It's true that there is plenty of evidence that the amount of
cocaine being produced has increased significantly during recent
years,'' von Raab said, ``but the amount of cocaine we have been
seizing shows that we have greatly increased our ability to stop
it.''
   Von Raab credited a new automated system that compares cargo
manifests with programmed criteria to help customs officers decide
which shipments to examine.
   The system, he said, helped pinpoint the largest cocaine
shipment ever seized _ 9,230 pounds found in plastic containers
concealed in hallowed-out lumber shipped in a container that
arrived in Tampa, Fla., on April 28.
   Von Raab said officers have used the automated program to find
33,000 pounds of cocaine in cargo containers since November 1987.
   The commissioner said state and local police have helped in some
of the seizures. Operations in all of fiscal 1987 brought in 88,000
pounds.
   With a boom in cocaine production in South America, the amount
confiscated by federal and state officials has increased every year
since 1982 when it was only 11,150 pounds.
   In addition to seizures from commercial shipments, air
operations netted 22,000 pounds of cocaine and marine operations
accounted for another 17,500 pounds, von Raab said. The remainder
came in various operations along the nation's Southwest border and
elsewhere in the country, he said.

<HEAD>Perot Deal To Be Shelved, Competition Sought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service said Wednesday it was
shelving a major portion of a contract with Texas billionnaire H.
Ross Perot that drew fire from Congress and private industry and
spawned a court test of the service's purchasing rules.
   At stake is a potentially lucrative deal to design and implement
cost-saving procedures for the massive mail-carrying agency _ a
contract initially awarded to Perot without competitive bidding.
   ``This was clearly a mistake that I hope it is not too late to
rectify,'' Postmaster General Anthony Frank told a pair of Senate
subcommittees Wednesday.
   Phase two of the arrangemMarch 1, told
the hearings Wednesday he approved the deal because of Perot's
proven ability to find innovative solutions to problems.
   ``I attempted to harness the unique talents of Ross Perot and
his new company to save money for the Postal Service. ... For that
I have no apoligies to make or regrets to express,'' Frank said.
   Following the June announcement, Congress quickly criticized the
no-bid deal and its payment system for Perot. Critics also said the
postal service apparently ignored standard procedures for issuing
contracts.
   Two companies disappointed at not getting chance to bid on the
deal filed protests with the General Services Administration board
of contract appeals on June 16. They are EDS Inc., Perot's former
company now owned by General Motors, and Planning Research Corp.
   On June 22, the Senate voted unanimously to call for a
suspension of the deal until its General Accounting Office could
study the contract and issue a report. The Postal Service agreed to
suspend phase two, pending the report.
   Then the General Services appeals panel ordered the entire
contract suspended on July 8, ruling that it violated federal
purchasing procedures. On Aug. 4 the panel followed up by ruling
that the contract was void.
   The postal service has appealed to a federal court, contending
that it is exempt from the appeals agency. But it suspended work by
the Perot group anyway, pending a ruling.
   The General Accounting Office, meanwhile, completed its report,
saying the deal was signed under very unusual circumstaces and that
it had ``serious concerns'' about it.

   The United States is airlifting emergency
shelters to Sudan where hundreds are feared dead from the worst
flooding to hit the northern African country in more than 40 years,
it was announced Wednesday.
   The United States has also given $1 million for other relief
supplies, as well as 1,200 tons of grain and food for the flood
victims in Khartoum, said a statement by the Agency for
International Development.
   The agency has arranged to airlift more than 850 rolls of
plastic sheets for tents to house some of the estimated 1.5 million
Sudanese left homeless by the high waters, AID said.
   In addition, an agency flood relief expert is en route to Sudan
to assess the damage. Once his report is completed, the United
States will determine how much additional aid it will provide to
the international effort getting under way to ease the flood
suffering, the statement said.
   American officials in Khartoum have already undertaken an aerial
survey of Khartoum and the Gedaref region to assess the damage, AID
said.

<HEAD>Tass: Cosmonaut Died of Brain Tumor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brain tumor killed Cosmonaut Anatoly Levchenko,
who was in line to fly the new Soviet space shuttle, the Tass news
agency said Wednesday.
   The agency on Tuesday reported that Levchenko, 47, had died, but
did not mention the cause of death. Other obituaries said only that
he died Saturday of a ``grave illness.''
   Doctors operated on the test pilot after discovering the tumor
but were unable to save him, the official news agency said. The
obituary was the first confirmation that Levchenko was involved in
the shuttle program.
   ``In recent times he participated in research of space
technology and could have become a crew member of a future Soviet
reusable spaceship,'' Tass said.
   His death could set back the fledgling shuttle program.
   In an obituary signed by fellow cosmonauts and Soviet leaders,
the Communist Party daily Pravda said Wednesday that Levchenko
helped improve the effectiveness of his country's air force.
   Levchenko, born in the town of Krasnokutsk in the Ukraine,
joined a team of cosmonauts testing space vehicles in 1981, Tass
said.
   Earlier Soviet media reports have said Levchenko was preparing
for the first flight of the Soviet space shuttle.
   Levchenko last entered space on Dec. 21, when he and cosmonauts
Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov lifted off aboard a Soyuz TM-4
capsule and docked two days later with the orbiting space station
Mir.
   He returned to Earth on Dec. 29 along with Alexander Alexandrov,
who had been aboard Mir since July 1987, and Yuri Romanenko, who
had spent a record 326 days in space.
   Titov and Manarov remain aboard Mir, and Soviet officials have
said the station will be manned permanently.
   Soviet space officials concede they are having problems
developing the space shuttle and have also given conflicting
indications about whether its first flight would be piloted or
unmanned.
   Officials have indicated the Soviet shuttle would be similar to
the U.S. space shuttle that has been grounded since the January
1986 explosion of the Challenger, which killed all seven crew
members.
   The Kremlin has not announced when the first launch of the
Soviet shuttle will take place, but officials had said privately
that the flight would probably be in the first half of this year _
a timetable that has not been met.

<HEAD>Carrier Adds Crew Bases In Miami, Nashville</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines announced plans Wednesday to base
as many as 700 pilots and flight attendants in south Florida,
leaving it ready to capitalize on problems facing Eastern Airlines
and Pan American World Airways.
   ``American Airlines is deeply committed to the Florida market
and believes Florida will play a critical role in our future
expansion,'' said Robert W. Baker, senior vice president for
operations of the carrier, based in Fort Worth, Texas.
   A spokeswoman for Miami-based Eastern said American's plans
shouldn't affect the struggling carrier. Miami-area business and
government leaders expressed delight at American's plans, which the
carrier's officials estimate will pump more than $70 million a year
into the south Florida economy.
   ``I am very, very, extremely pleased,'' said Clara Oesterle, a
Dade County commissioner who attended American's news conference.
``This means a lot to this community.''
   She noted that Miami International Airport relies heavily on
user fees. Eastern and Pan Am, the two largest users of the
airport, have said they need labor concessions to avoid cutting
back operations.
   American's expansion to south Florida is based on expectations
that the Florida and Caribbean markets will continue to grow, not
on problems competitors are having, Baker said.
   ``The specific and well-known problems of Eastern really had
very little to do with our decision,'' Baker said, but added the
expansion in Miami will ``give us some additional flexibility'' in
case some of the Latin American routes now flown by Pan Am and
Eastern become available.
   American, based in Texas, also plans to add a flight attendant
crew base in Nashville, Tenn., one of five American hubs. American
also has hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Raleigh-Durham and San
Juan.
   The Miami and Nashville crew bases bring American's total crew
bases to 12. American said it will staff a new flight attendant
crew base in Nashville with 75 flight attendants in October and
perhaps as many as 600 in the early 1990s.
   American officials were unsure how many employees might
eventually be added. Baker said several hundred American employees
already live in south Florida and commute to the hubs.
   By January, American will base 160 flight crew members in Miami,
Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Baker said. The total will
reach 700 ``within a few years,'' he said.
   Eastern, with its corporate headquarters here, has some 850
pilots and 1,800 flight attendants based in Miami, she said.
   ``I don't think it will have any effect,'' Eastern spokeswoman
Paula Musto said, referring to American's move. ``American is in a
growing mode, and if Miami is their choice, I say more power to the
Miami community and economy.''

<HEAD>10 Inner-City Youngsters Return from Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They returned in triumph from travels half a
world away _ 10 black youngsters who overcame considerable odds to
make their dreams of Africa come true.
   The children from Suder Elementary School, ages 11 to 14, raised
$30,000 in less than 10 months to pay for the two-week trip that
took them from one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods to Senegal,
Ivory Coast and Togo on the West African coast, the ancestral
homeland of many American blacks.
   The excited young travelers stood out Tuesday in the bustling
crowds at O'Hare International Airport, with their carved walking
sticks and identical green knapsacks proclaiming ``Africa.''
   All had stories to tell.
   ``We just spoke French a little because so many people we met
knew English, but we did say `bonjour' a lot,'' said Yo-seanda
Baines, 13.
   ``We saw the slave houses where they kept the slaves. We saw the
Senegal museum. It was wonderful,'' said Hardy Shorter, 12. ``We
saw the African sculptures from long ago.''
   ``We had food pretty much like we have here,'' said Charnae
Harmon, 13. ``We learned to eat like the Africans, though, using
our fingers.''
   ``We had fish and rice a lot, and chicken and rice a lot, too,''
said her twin sister, Renee.
   Souvenirs were chosen carefully _ and imaginatively.
   Charlene Brown came home with a new braided hair style, courtesy
of her Senegalese pen pal's mother.
   ``It was a souvenir I could take everywhere,'' she said.
   ``Most of the boys bought some noisy hand games where you
clatter wooden balls together, and the girls mostly bought tribal
jewelry and handbags,'' said Suder Principal Brenda Daigre, whose
previous travels in Africa made her the driving force behind the
student effort.
   ``We all bought a lot of carved wood, but no ivory. We're poor
people.''
   The students prepared for the trip by writing to African pen
pals, taking after-school classes in African culture and art, and
studying French for a year. All three countries are former French
colonies.
   But the big hurdle was the money.
   Some of the funds came from churches and community groups, but
the students raised much of it by running a candy store at school
and by putting on a talent show and basketball and volleyball
games, Mrs. Daigre said.
   ``We taught them how to set long-range goals,'' the principal
said of the youngsters, most of whom live in the Henry Horner
public housing project.
   Some parents were skeptical.
   ``I remember last October, when they came home from school and
said: `Guess what? We're going to go to Africa,''' said George
West, as he waited for his sons, Brian, 12, and Daryl, 11, to clear
customs.
   ``I just said, `Yeah ... right,' but ... they made a believer
out of me.''
   Mrs. Daigre said an earlier visit to Africa made her feel she
had ``come home,'' and that she wanted her students to have a
chance to discover their own African roots.
   The principal, who accompanied the youngsters, said the trip
worked out so well she wants to arrange another one and is working
on a permanent cultural exchange with a journalist the travelers
met in Senegal.
   ``It was a complete success,'' the principal said. ``Nobody got
sick, nobody got lost and nobody spent too much money.''

   American and Soviet scientists
looking for solutions to global pollution are cruising portions of
the Bering Sea that long have been off-limits to U.S. scientists.
   The six-week joint research project is the third expedition in
the last 10 years. Similar studies in 1979 and in 1984 were
restricted _ at Soviet insistence _ to U.S. waters.
   ``This will enable us to fill in a lot of the gaps in our data
about how the ocean operates on the Soviet side,'' said John
Goering, an organizer of the U.S. research team. ``Before now,
we've had to guess at how the currents and dynamics of that part of
the Bering Sea work.''
   Most of the Soviet scientists are monitoring pollution levels
and determining how pollutants are transported in the Bering and
Chukchi seas.
   Alla Tsiban, the chief Soviet scientist on the cruise, was a
member of the 1984 expedition that found trace amounts of toxic
PCBs in the Bering Sea.
   ``In my opinion, most of it comes from the atmosphere,'' she
said. ``I expect we will find higher levels this time. We will
combine our efforts this expedition to determine the load capacity
of the marine ecosystem for these pollutants.''
   Pat Roscigno, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service scientist, said
researchers can figure out how to control the pollution if they can
determine where it's coming from and how much is in the water.

<HEAD>Iran Says Middle East In Danger Unless Iraq Blamed For War</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with speech by Rafsanjani. No pickup.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's acting commander-in-chief, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said Wednesday a U.N. inquiry must condemn Iraq as the
aggressor in the Persian Gulf war or the region will face grave
consequences.
   Also on Wednesday, small groups of U.N. officials arrived in
Tehran and Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, to prepare for hundreds of
observers who will monitor a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire set for Aug.
20.
   Tehran Radio said Iraqi warplanes violated Iranian airspace in
the southwest, but no bombing was reported. Iraqi reports monitored
in Cyprus did not mention air activity.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border skirmishes.
   ``In the pursuit of our aggressor, we want justice. We have no
territorial ambitions,'' Rafsanjani told an international
conference organized by Iran to discuss ``aggression and defense.''
   Iran wants ``justice and punishment of the aggressor who has
violated all principles'' of international law, said Rafsanjani,
who also is the speaker of Parliament.
   He said Iraq started the war, was the first to resort to
indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets and to attack ships in
the gulf, and was alone in using chemical weapons.
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, which Iran accepted last
month, calls on the secretary-general to ``explore, in consultation
with Iran and Iraq, the question of entrusting an impartial body
with inquiring into responsibility for the conflict and to report
to the council as soon as possible.''
   The plan also includes the cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized
borders, prisoner exchange and peace negotiations. Direct talks are
to begin in Geneva on Aug. 25.
   ``We have accepted the resolution with the hope that on the
committee determining the responsibility of the aggressor, they
(the United Nations) are serious,'' Rafsanjani said. ``We hope
events do not take place that make us think they have told us lies.
   ``If we have such a feeling, this might have grave consequences
for the region.''
   He said Iran would have agreed to a cease-fire seven years ago
if it had had assurances then that an impartial inquiry would be
opened to determine war guilt.
   Rafsanjani also said a U.S. warship acted deliberately when it
shot down an Iran Air jetliner last month and killed 290 people.
The United States said the crew mistook the jetliner for an
attacking fighter.
   ``We think it was ... a warning to the region to make us
understand that if you want to continue your defense, they
(Americans) are ready to do anything,'' he said. ``They wanted to
show us that savagery has no boundary if their interests are
jeopardized.''
   Cyrus Nasseri, head of the Iranian U.N. mission in Geneva, said
Iran also wants ``compensation for aggression'' in the war but gave
no details. Official Iranian estimates put war damage at $350
billion.
   Five members of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group met
with officials in the Iranian capital to prepare for the arrival of
the 350 observers who will oversee a truce.
   Observers will work initially in the southern and western areas
of Iran, monitoring military movements until the cease-fire starts,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Another team of five other U.N. officials arrived in Baghdad,
with six more due Friday and others in ensuing days, sources close
to the delegation said in the Iraqi capital.
   All 350 observers from 25 countries are expected to be on
station within a week, well before the scheduled cease-fire date,
U.N. officials said.
   The operation will cost $74 million for the initial six months
the Security Council authorized, including $47 million in start-up
costs. U.N. officials say they will have a hard time meeting the
bill unless members, particularly the United States, pay arrears in
dues.
   Washington has withheld dues to demand personnel cuts, budget
reform and changes in other U.S. practices and owes $467 million.
   U.S. officials made clear Wednesday they hope gulf Arab nations
will pay a substantial part of the expense.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington: ``We
do intend to urge the gulf states, who are the chief beneficiaries
of this settlement, to share in the cost through voluntary
contributions. We'll be giving the same message to other countries
like Japan ... who have an interest in the gulf.''
   Japan has donated $20 million to U.N. peacekeeping efforts
already this year, reserving half for the Iran-Iraq operation. The
Japanese import nearly all their oil and get most of it from the
gulf region.

<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rear Adm. John Duncan Bulkeley, 76, the last
Navy admiral on active duty to see combat in World War II, will
retire Aug. 31 after more than 55 years of military service, the
Defense Department said Wednesday.
   President Reagan will honor Bulkeley by nominating him for
promotion to the three-star rank of vice admiral as he begins his
retirement, the Pentagon said. Senate confirmation was virtually
assured.
   Bulkeley, a Medal of Honor winner, is known within the Navy as
the officer who safely evacuated Gen. Douglas MacArthur to
Australia in March 1942 after the Japanese invaded the Philippines.
   Through most of World War II, Bulkeley commanded various motor
torpedo boat squadrons in the Pacific theater.
   He received the nation's highest military award for his
squadron's success in damaging or destroying Japanese planes,
warships and merchant ships during more than four months of duty in
Philippine waters ``without benefit of repairs, overhaul or
maintenance facilities.''
   ``His dynamic forcefulness and daring in offensive action, his
brilliantly planned and skillfully executed attacks ...
characterize him as an outstanding leader of men and a gallant and
intrepid seaman,'' the citation said.
   Bulkeley has spent the last 21 years as head of the Naval Board
of Inspection and Survey, which is responsible for inspecting all
ships and shore facilities for their equipment's readiness.
   Bulkeley technically retired from the Navy in 1974, but was
immediately recalled to active duty to continue directing the
inspection board.
   Bulkeley could not be reached for an interview Wednesday. The
Navy said he had been admitted to Bethesda Naval Medical Center,
Md., for tests related to a kidney problem.

<HEAD>Mayor Defends Balloons for Mickey Mouse's Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A marine specialist may be right when he says
Mickey Mouse birthday balloons can hurt sea creatures, but Mayor
Edward I. said Wednesday he still will not rain on Mickey's 60th
anniversary celebration.
   City Hall, Koch said, was the wrong place for the scientist to
lodge his grievance, suggesting he take it instead to the federal
government.
   The mayor planned to attend a party at the South Street Seaport
where the balloons were to be released by the Disney organization
to mark the 1928 debut of animated Mickey Mouse cartoons.
   Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding
Center at Brigantine, N.J., said Tuesday that he sent a telegram
alerting Koch to the danger balloons represent to marine mammals.
   Schoelkopf said deflated balloons that wind up in the ocean can
kill creatures that mistake them for food and eat them.
   Schoelkopf's complaints, Koch said, ``apparently have not had
much influence on the environmentalists because it's never been
raised before, at least with me.''
   ``I don't even like the tone of his comments,'' the mayor added.
   ``The fact that someone objects to something that someone else
is doing doesn't mean that they're automatically right,'' Koch
said. ``They may very well be, but shouldn't he be making his
complaints to the federal government that would have control over
the air?''
   ``Instead of raining on the Disney production or asking me to
rain on them, why doesn't he make his case to the Congress?''
   Disney organization spokesman Dan Scheffey, promoting a number
of events for the Mickey Mouse anniversary, said he had been
assured by the supplier of the balloons that they were ``perfectly
safe for the environment.''
   He said he had no information that the balloons could harm
marine life.

   Swarms of locusts have spread into central and east
Africa, and there is an urgent need for money to fight the pests, a
U.N. organization said Wednesday.
   ``The necessary funds are not coming in fast enough to help us
contain this potentially lethal threat,'' said Lucas Brader, head
of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency
Center for Locust Operations.
   Money is needed for insecticides, equipment and other operating
costs, in part because of late payments by some of the Rome-based
organization's major contributors, the group said.
   The United States, which pays a quarter of the agency's budget,
last month paid $25 million of its overdue assessment for 1986 and
1987. It has not yet paid its 1988 assessment of $60.7 million.
   Brader said 7.5 million acres of land must be treated in Chad
where large swarms have been sighted.
   In Sudan, locusts have covered several hundred square miles and
are moving east, he said. The insects were reported to be breeding
in the eastern region of North Darfur and the eastern regions of
Khartoum and Kassala.
   In Ethiopia, a dozen swarms of locusts have been seen in the
Asmara area near the Red Sea Major control measures had to be
adopted before the locusts swarmed south into the central Ethiopian
highland and toward the Horn of Africa, Brader said.
   He estimated that $90 million to $100 million would be needed in
Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia to prevent large harvest losses.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 6 percent of Medicare patients are
receiving substandard hospital care, with lower quality more likely
in small, rural hospitals, according to government figures released
Wednesday.
   The study of hospitalized Medicare patients in fiscal 1985 found
that 6.6 percent received substandard care, particularly omissions,
mistakes, unnecessary procedures and inadequate documentation of
medical records.
   ``Small hospitals had the highest overall rates of poor quality
patient care,'' the Department of Health and Human Services report
said.
   Hospitals with fewer than 100 beds had a rate of 11.4 percent of
substandard care, the report said. By comparison, hospitals with
between 100 beds and 200 beds had problems in 5.1 percent of
patients. Large hospitals had a 3.5 percent rate of substandard
care.
   By location, rural hospitals recorded poor quality care in 10.7
percent of cases, compared with 4.1 percent for urban hospitals,
the study said.
   Non-profit and profit-making facilities had similar rates: 5.7
percent for the profit-makers and 6.7 percent for non-profits.
   Teaching hospitals did well, with 3.0 percent getting poor care,
compared with 7.9 percent for non-teaching facilities.
   Most patients receiving substandard care had multiple problems,
the report found. The illnesses most often associated with lack of
good care were strokes, penumonia, respiratory failure, fainting,
kidney and urinary infections.
   Overall, the study estimated that the government paid hospitals
$1.2 billion in 1985 for patients who received poor quality care.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called on
Palestinians Wednesday to end their uprising and negotiate peace
with Israel, and he vowed he would fight the establishment of an
Arab homeland in the occupied lands.
   ``Israel will prevent in the most determined way any attempt to
carry out any idea _ to the extent that there are madmen who raise
it _ of establishing a Palestinian government,'' Shamir told
Parliament. ``Such people will be met with an iron fist that will
leave no trace of their attempts.''
   A declaration of independence published last week called for a
Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, parts of the
Galilee and east Jerusalem.
   The proposal came after Jordan said it was severing legal and
administrative links with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Jordan
had maintained the ties even though Israel captured the territories
in 1967.
   King Hussein of Jordan said he severed the ties because the
Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate
representative of Palestinians.
   In his first public comments on Hussein's move, PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat said his group is capable of taking over Jordan's
administrative role.
   Arafat also criticized Jordan and the PLO's Arab allies, who had
been forewarned, for failing to notify the PLO before Jordan acted.
   ``The PLO was not consulted beforehand and was not officially
notified until after the measures (by Jordan) were announced, when
it (the PLO) is the party that is directly concerned in all this,''
said Arafat.
   He insisted the PLO is capable of assuming Jordan's
administrative role in the occupied lands, and he assured the 1.5
million Palestinians living there that the PLO's institutions ``are
capable of absorbing everything.''
   Arafat's remarks were published Tuesday in the Saudi Arabian
newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat. Copies of the paper were obtained in
Bahrain on Wednesday.
   Shamir, responding to left-wing critics, told Parliament during
a special session that Jordan's move would ``harm the Arab
residents and not the state of Israel, which will continue to
maintain legal and security control as always.''
   The session was called by leftist factions protesting Israel's
failure to seek a dialogue with Palestinians and its tough tactics
in quelling the eight-month uprising in which 238 Palestinians and
four Israelis have died.
   ``At this fateful moment, what does our government say to the
Palestinians? Nothing, but force them to live in degradation,''
said Gad Yatziv of the socialist Mapam Party. ``How long will you
go on deceiving yourselves before you realize the bombings and
deportations won't do any good?''
   Shamir, whose 20-minute speech was interrupted half a dozen
times by catcalls, said Israel sought a dialogue with Palestinians
but would never negotiate with the PLO or countenance attempts to
create a Palestinian state.
   ``It must be clear as the noon sun ... the state of Israel will
not play this game,'' said Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud
bloc.
   In an earlier closed-door Cabinet meeting, Shamir argued with
his coalition partner, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the
left-leaning Labor Party, about peace policies, Israel radio
reported. Shamir accused Peres of siding with Arabs who contend
Likud is blocking peace, the radio said.
   In a related development, Labor ministers said the party, which
has based its peace strategy on Jordan, was considering a change in
its platform for November elections in the wake of Hussein's latest
steps.
   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal told The Associated Press the party
may add a plank saying Israel would speak ``either to Palestinians
from the West Bank and Gaza or Jordanians, but preferably
together.''
   The platform now calls for peace talks with a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and favors territorial compromise
with Jordan.
   Arafat told the Saudi newspaper he opposes sending a
Palestinian-Jordanian delegation to a proposed Middle East peace
conference because ``that idea has been erased from our dictionary
even though Jordan has been repeating it.'' He said the PLO prefers
sending a pan-Arab delegation that would include Egypt.
   In Cairo on Wednesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Murphy ended his Middle East tour after failing to initiate
Arab-Israeli peace talks. Besides Egypt, Murphy visited Lebanon,
Syria, Israel and Jordan.
   On Tuesday, Murphy said Egypt failed to arrange a Cairo meeting
between him and Palestinian representatives. He gave no reason, but
a Palestinian source, who demanded anonymity, said Murphy objected
to two proposed participants because they were closely linked to
the PLO.
   Also on Wednesday, an Israeli soldier was burned in the face and
hands by a firebomb thrown at a military jeep in the West Bank city
of Ramallah. An Arab woman also was slightly burned on the leg in
the attack, the army said.
   Troops, meanwhile, fatally wounded a 17-year-old Palestinian in
a clash with Arab protesters who stoned a military fuel tank in the
village of Tubas, Al Ittihad Hospital officials said.
   The youth, Ahmed Salah Darameh, died on the operating table at
the hospital after he was shot in the chest, according to a
hospital official who demanded anonymity. His death brought the
number of Palestinian deaths in the eight-month revolt to 239. Four
Israelis also have died.
   Elsewhere, 1st Lt. Orit Wolf said the army had begun using
attack dogs against Palestinian rioters in the West Bank, three
newspapers reported. The army said this was against military policy
and it was checking the report.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Wednesday it
opposes provisions of an anti-racketeering bill that would curtail
the role of trustees appointed by courts to run corrupt labor
unions.
   John C. Keeney, a deputy attorney general in the department's
Criminal Division said the proposed changes ``would be disastrous''
to government anti-racketeering suits against unions, such as the
case filed in June against the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters.
   Keeney testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee that is
considering legislation to change the rules for civil actions filed
under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known
as RICO.
   The law allows the government and private plaintiffs to file
suits alleging corrupt business practices and racketeering.
Originally intended for suits against organized crime, the law has
been used _ some say abused _ as a weapon by private plaintiffs to
strike at their competitors.
   With its provisions for treble damages, critics say the law has
provided unnecessary windfalls to plaintiffs.
   Legislation in both houses of Congress would sharply curtail the
treble damage provisions, although suits filed by the government
could still seek that penalty.
   While the Teamsters suit was the first time the Justice
Department sought a trustee to run an international union, it has
filed numerous suits to place union locals under trusteeships.
   Keeney told the subcommittee on criminal justice:
   ``These provisions would set strict limits on the purposes for
which trustees could be imposed ... and would set an 18-month limit
on the duration of a trusteeship, unless the trustee could satisfy
a burden to justify one or more six-month extensions.''
   He said such provisions are unworkable and were adapted from
federal labor law that applies to trusteeships imposed by labor
organizations on their subordinate unions.
   ``Those laws were designed to protect against arbitrary or
improper trusteeships imposed without due process of law,'' Keeney
said.
   ``Such limitations are not needed, and have no place, in the
context of a trusteeship imposed by a federal district court after
full hearings for all parties in order to correct abuses within the
organization.''
   Keeney said the only permissible purpose for seeking a
trusteeship under the House legislation would be to correct
corruption or financial malpractice, to restore democratic
procedures or to carry out legitimate objectives of the labor
organization.
   ``These purposes are too narrow,'' Keeney said. ``For example,
if the union were being used for clearly criminal ends outside the
context of international labor union affairs _ such as trafficking
in illegal drugs _ the purposes stated in the bill would probably
not apply, and a trusteeship could not be imposed ....''
   He added that the restrictions on the duration of a trusteeship
``would make it very burdensome for a trustee to perform his duties
effectively, as is evident from our experience'' in at least one
case where a union local has had a trustee for more than two years.

<HEAD>Massive Insider Trading Suspected On Tokyo Stock Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulatory authorities suspect massive insider
trading sent stock prices soaring on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
before a major corporate cooperation agreement was announced,
officials said Wednesday.
   It was an unusual admission in Japan, where insider trading has
been an acknowledged way of doing business. Until recently,
securities laws have ignored all but the most blatant forms of
trading based on privileged information.
   Officials at the Finance Ministry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange
said they were investigating a case last month in which the share
price of Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co., a precision machinery
maker, jumped hours before the announcement of Sankyo's agreement
with Nippon Steel Co., Japan's largest steel maker. The companies
did not merge or form a joint venture but agreed officially to
cooperate in some areas.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange took the unusual move of suspending
trading in Sankyo shares on the afternoon of July 29, but the
volume of Sankyo shares traded in the morning was still nearly 10
times the previous day's level.
   Securities officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said
they suspected a leak.
   The national daily Asahi Shimbun and the Japan Broadcast Corp.
reported that numerous Nippon Steel and Sankyo employees bought
several thousand Sankyo shares early on July 29. Both companies
denied the allegation.
   Under current laws, workers who bought the shares with prior
knowledge of the tie-up will not be subject to criminal punishment.
But the government can warn the companies or take administrative
action, such as prohibiting them from exporting for a while.
   A stock exchange official said the body has asked securities
companies that dealt in Sankyo shares to submit lists of investors.
   ``We have obtained information on about 90 percent of the people
who bought Sankyo shares on that day,'' said Hitoshi Shimakura,
head of the exchange's Transaction Review Section.
   The case is the latest in a series of stock scandals that have
shaken political and business circles in Japan. It came to light at
a time when public outcry for stricter controls over insider
trading has been growing.
   This summer, aides to some of Japan's top political and business
leaders, including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, made huge
profits by buying unlisted shares of a Tokyo real estate concern
and selling them after public trading began.
   That incident, called ``Recruit-Gate'' after the real estate
firm Recruit-Cosmos, grew into a major impediment for Takeshita
when the political opposition used it to block parliamentary debate
on the government's unpopular tax revision package.
   Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and a dozen other
top politicians admitted their aides were involved and apologized
for poor supervision.
   The deals were legal under Japanese laws but highlighted the
close ties between business and politics and raised questions about
political ethics.
   The Finance Ministry decided last week to hasten by more than
two months the implementation of the Revised Securities Exchange
Law, which gives authorities power for tighter surveillance and
control and allows for criminal punishment for insider trading.
   The new law, announced in February, will take effect in stages
beginning this month instead of November, officials said.

<HEAD>Oil Company Sinking Well on Edge Of Paris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oil company is drilling an exploratory well just
outside Paris under a permit that could lead to similar projects
inside the capital.
   The company, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, said drilling the
6,000-foot-deep hole in the southern suburb of Ivry-Sur-Seine will
take about three weeks.
   The exploratory well at Ivry, 1\ miles outside the Paris, is the
first under the Paris-Ile de France permit shared by Elf, Total
Compagnie Francaise des Petroles and British Petroleum.
   The permit, awarded in December 1985, covers 590 square miles
and includes the city of Paris. The area is part of the Paris
Basin, a 50,000-square-mile region that stretches from Paris
eastward to the West German border.
   It has 40 million tons of known oil reserves.
   The drilling at Ivry is being done on an industrial site owned
by the state-run power company, Electricite de France. The
exploratory well is the culmination of extensive seismic studies of
the permit area which found several structures that might contain
hydrocarbons, Elf officials said.
   Total has said it will drill a well on its share of the permit
by the end of the year. British Pertroleum has not disclosed its
plans.
   Jean Perrot, Elf's assistant director of exploration in France,
has said the drilling at Ivry, which began Tuesday, will help
determine the size of the structure there and whether it contains
oil in marketable quantities.
   A success at Ivry would encourage more extensive testing inside
Paris, where seismic tests were limited and particularly difficult
because of the subway system, sewerage lines and other
interferences, a spokesman for Elf, Alexis Poutchkovsky, said in a
recent interview.

<HEAD>Congress Asked to Delay Alcohol Labeling Bill Pending Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration asked Congress on
Wednesday to delay acting on a proposal to require health warning
labels on alcoholic beverages until a study of the bill's impact is
completed.
   William T. Drake, deputy director of the Treasury Department's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, told a Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation subcommittee that his agency is studying
the issue and would report to Congress by the end of the year.
   ``While the administration is on record as recognizing that the
health hazards related to alcohol consumption comprise one of the
nation's most serious problems, we believe any legislation should
await the completion of studies on the impacts of alcohol
labeling,'' Drake said.
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., would
require five rotating labels on beer, wine and distilled spirits.
They would warn against abuse of alcohol during pregnancy, the
dangers of liver disease, hypertension and cancer, impaired driving
ability, the danger of combining alcohol with other drugs and the
addictive nature of alcohol.
   ``Not only does common sense tell us that consumers need to be
more aware of the effects of alcohol, experts in the field have
long been calling for alcohol warning labels,'' Thurmond said.
   Thurmond displayed a pamphlet he said had been recently
distributed to all Senate offices by the Distilled Spirits Council
of the United States, claiming to reflect ``the latest findings in
alcohol research.''
   Thurmond said the pamphlet `` contains not one word about the
dangers of drinking while pregnant, not one word.''
   A committee spokeswoman said the liquor industry declined to
testify at the hearing.

   The drought baked all 420 acres of Keith
Salter's wheat, barley and oats crops. But with an inch of rain
last week and hopes of getting at least $12,000 in federal drought
aid, he sees a much brighter future.
   ``It's a good buffer, and it's probably enough to get most
people over the hump this year,'' the 53-year-old farmer said of
the $3.9 billion drought-relief package passed by Congress. ``It
won't be like a crop, but it's better than nothing.''
   The most expensive disaster relief measure ever enacted for
agriculture was approved by House on Tuesday after passing the
Senate the day before. The White House has said President Reagan
intends to sign the bill.
   Leaders of North Dakota's two largest farm organizations predict
most farmers in the state will qualify for some payments, although
they admit the aid won't be enough to keep all financially squeezed
farmers in business.
   ``If a farmer has been struggling these past few years ... this
will not allow him income to pay down debt and interest,'' said
John Leininger, spokesman for the 33,000-member North Dakota
Farmers Union. ``We are definitely going to see some farmers leave,
I am sure.''
   Leininger said the drought program would pump income, rather
than loans, into farmers' pockets, ``which is what they were
looking for.''
   Monty Burke, president of the 24,000-member North Dakota Farm
Bureau, said many farmers were breathing a collective sigh of
relief over the drought aid. ``It is going to keep some farmers in
business. It will be that simple,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his farm near McKenzie. ``Other farmers were going
to stay in business but were going to be in a weakened financial
position. This will give them the financial ability to go into
another year.''
   Asked whether the package contained enough money for farmers,
the 60-year-old farm leader said, ``Oh yes. ... I think it's all
that really could be expected out of Congress. Some farmers are
awfully hard-pressed for cash flow, and this is what it will
provide.''
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has labeled North Dakota the
state hardest hit by this summer's drought, which destroyed an
estimated 75 percent of the wheat, oats and barley crops and forced
many livestock producers to sell off cattle as hay crops and
pastures wilted in the unrelenting heat.
   The drought relief kicks in for growers who lost at least 35
percent of their crop, with the USDA providing payments equal to 65
percent of lost income. Farmers with crop losses exceeding 75
percent of expected yield will be eligible for payments equal to 90
percent of income lost as a result of crop losses.
   Exactly how much federal aid will flow to the state is unknown.
But Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., projected it would be something less
than $400 million.
   According to the Farmers Union, a farmer with an average wheat
yield of 30 bushels an acre who harvested nothing this year should
earn at least $42 an acre in disaster aid. The payment would go up
to about $92 an acre if the farmer had federal crop insurance.
   The same farmer harvesting a normal crop would earn about $114
per acre, based on market prices this spring, Leininger said.
   Salter, a farmer since 1954, said crop insurance adjusters
considered his small-grain crops a total loss.
   As near as Salter can figure it, the disaster program should
pump at least $12,000 into his bank account _ enough to pay most of
his bills. He also has federal crop insurance to fall back on.
   Still, Salter said the payments would be about $5,000 short of
what he would have collected had he harvested an average crop.
   Salter also raises cattle at his farm about 10 miles northeast
of Bismarck, and must also figure in the damage to his pastures and
the loss of hay crops for his 100 head of cows. Because of the
losses, he'll have to buy feed elsewhere.
   Projecting into the fall and winter and next year's spring
planting season, there will be other drought-caused expenses, too,
he anticipates. So overall, he figures the drought will set him
back at least $20,000 _ even after disaster payments and crop
insurance.
   ``You never do fully recover from a drought,'' he said,
surveying countryside that was parched brown in June but has turned
green from recent rains. ``It always hurts. ... Your operation
recovers but you never recover what income you lost.''

<HEAD>NATO Making `Significant' Cuts in Short-Range Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is
studying a ``fairly significant'' cut in short-range atomic weapons
that could be announced later this year, NATO's top military
officer said Wednesday.
   The cuts will be part of a package aimed at modernizing NATO's
arsenal of tactical atomic weapons, in which older weapons are
replaced by newer weapons, U.S. Army Gen. John R. Galvin said.
   Galvin's staff is halfway through a study involving the
modernization of NATO's battlefield nuclear weapons, he told
reporters.
   ``My own judgment of it (the study) is that it will result in
another reduction in the overall number of warheads and it will be
a fairly significant reduction, but the reduction will be
contingent on the modernization we can get,'' Galvin said.
   The study will be finished in December or January, Galvin said.
He declined to say how many weapons would be involved.
   ``I don't want to quantify now and I can't quantify now because
I really don't know what the number would be and I don't want to
make any guess at it. I would say it's going to be a significant
number,'' he explained.
   The United States and the Soviet Union now are conducting
preliminary-round inspections as part of the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces treaty, which requires both sides to eliminate all
medium- and short-range nuclear missiles within three years. The
INF cuts will eliminate weapons with ranges of 320 miles to 3,000
miles, but still will leave both sides with large arsenals of
so-called tactical weapons with ranges of less than 320 miles.
   After INF, NATO still will have about 4,200 tactical nuclear
weapons, including bombs, artillery shells and the Lance missile.
The Lance, with a range of 70 miles, is one of the prime weapons
NATO wants to modernize.
   The newest cuts would come out of the 4,200 total, Galvin said.
   The Soviets do not publish any statistics about their nuclear
weapons inventory, but are estimated to have far more
tactical-range weapons than NATO. For example, the Soviets have an
estimated 9,100 artillery and missile launchers capable of being
loaded with atomic-tipped weapons.
   The issue is politically sensitive, particularly in West
Germany, where many of the tactical-range weapons are based. If
those weapons are used, they are likely to fall upon German soil,
Galvin noted.
   The upcoming cuts ``will help express to the Germans that we are
aware of their concerns,'' said Galvin. He contended that ``there
is no political purpose or intention in bringing this up now.''
   On two other occasions in recent years, NATO has announced
unilateral reductions, Galvin noted, including a cut of 1,000
warheads and a second decrease of 1,400.
   ``This is going to be a unilateral reduction, as the other ones
were,'' Galvin noted.
   ``I don't think we've taken enough credit for the fact that
we've already made two very large unilateral reductions,'' he said.
``The Soviets would have made that a massive propaganda campaign''
had they made similar cuts, he said.
   One of the reasons for the reductions will be the fact that the
Soviets will lose some of their most threatening nuclear weapons
because of the INF pact, Galvin said.
   ``It isn't a question of what do we have, it is a question of
what do we have versus what do they have,'' he said.

   George Bush complained Wednesday that
President Reagan is being unfairly accused of ``playing 1988
politics'' with recent Cabinet and policy decisions and added: ``I
guess it's just that time of year.''
   Bush denied that a host of recent Reagan decisions, including
the nomination of a Hispanic to be education secretary, were
calculated to bolster the vice president's election prospects.
   In a meeting with reporters, he noted that National Education
Association officials had ascribed political motives to Reagan's
selection of Texas Tech University President Lauro F. Cavazos to
succeed Education Secretary William Bennett.
   ``I guess it's normal that everything he does, people will
accuse him of playing politics. But I certainly won't add any
validity to that charge,'' Bush said.
   Bush had called reporters to his office complex in the Old
Executive Office Building next to the White House to announce the
selection of former Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, a close Reagan
confidant, as a Bush presidential campaign co-chairman.
   At the same time, Bush refused to say how many people remain
under serious consideration as his vice presidential running mate,
saying he had not made up his mind, has ``set no date'' for
deciding. Bush said he was working ``very prudently and calmly'' on
the decision-making process.
   Meanwhile, Bush worked on his acceptance speech for next week's
Republican National Convention, electronically transmitting _
faxing _ material between his office and speech writer Peggy
Noonan, working at her home across town.
   And with guidance from the Bush high command, Republicans were
at work a few blocks from their New Orleans convention hall
crafting their platform.
   Bush chafed at a question of whether a host of recent
presidential decisions have been geared toward boosting the vice
president's position against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in
public opinion polls.
   Reagan had filled two Cabinet vacancies with people known to be
on close terms with Bush, nominating former Pennsylvania Gov.
Richard Thornburgh to be attorney general and picking Wall Street
investment banker Nicholas F. Brady to succeed Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III.
   On Tuesday, the president picked Cavazos to head the Education
Department, a month after Bush promised a Hispanic audience in
Dallas that he would put a Hispanic in the Cabinet if elected.
   Bush's influence also was widely seen in Reagan's decision to
allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law and in the
president's veto of a $299.5 billion defense authorization bill.
   Referring to the NEA comments on Cavanos' selection, Bush said,
``People jump all over him accusing him of playing 1988 politics.''
He said the president was ``running his office with strength and
with the same determination that he's had since he was elected
president.''
   Reagan had scoffed at a similar question Tuesday, telling
reporters that ``I'm just still working on the job here.''
   Asked whether the administration was, nonetheless, taking on an
increasingly Bush look, the vice president replied, ``I don't think
they've ever had a non-George Bush look to it. It's just been put
into a focus of George Bush because I'm the, will be, the nominee
of the party.''
   ``Yes, I was asked about the secretary of education job,'' he
said. ``I expressed my opinion. But I'm not going to start doing
now that which I've been unwilling to do. And that is jumping out
trying to take credit for or responsibility for what is a very
important presidential appointment.''
   ``But I can understand ... almost everything the president does,
he gets asked a question, `Are you doing this to help George Bush?'
or `Are you doing this because of '88?' and I guess it's just that
time of year.''
   Laxalt joins several other people who have the title of Bush
campaign co-chairman. They include Govs. John Sununu of New
Hampshire, Bob Martinez of Florida and Jim Thompson of Illinois.
Also included are Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., former Sen. Barry
Goldwater of Arizona, Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, and Rep. Lynn
Martin, R-Ill.
   Bush called Laxalt ``one of the most respected figures in public
life and certainly in the Republican Party'' and said that Laxalt's
principal responsibility would be to help Bush in the West and to
help coordinate Reagan's campaign activities.
   Laxalt, a longtime friend of Reagan, said that once Bush is
nominated in New Orleans next Wednesday night, ``he'll develop his
own aura and independence as a result of that.''

<HEAD>Cher Introduces New Perfume</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like glamorous Sophia Loren, passionate
Elizabeth Taylor and elegant Gloria Vanderbilt, Cher has sniffed
the sweet smell of success, and she wants to share it with women
everywhere.
   Unveiling a luxury perfume that she helped develop and that
does, of course, bear her name, Cher appeared Wednesday at the
Plaza Hotel, wearing a black, skin-tight, off-the-shoulder
mini-dress by Bob Mackie, adorned with a peek-a-boo lace hem and
one lace sleeve.
   ``This is something new to me as a business,'' she said,
introducing ``Cher _ Uninhibited.''
   ``Uninhibited means something different to every one of us. .. .
It can suit every woman's idea of fantasy,'' said Cher, who added
that her own definition might be ``running naked through the park.''
   Michael Stern, president of Parfums Stern, said the fragrance
will be available around Nov. 1. Prices will range from $30 for a
1.7-ounce eau de toilette spray to $300 for a 1.7-ounce ``deluxe
perfume presentation.''
   Until now, Cher wore several perfumes simultaneously. She tried
out ``Uninhibited'' on friends during the testing, and her
boyfriend, Robert Camilletti, ``actually, finally liked it,'' she
said.
   ``When we first met ... I sprayed my perfume inside his leather
jacket and he said, `I can't stop thinking about you; I even smell
you.' And I thought, `It's a wicked trick, but it worked,''' she
confided.

<HEAD>Emigres Celebrate Arrival With Viennese Night Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A refusenik family that became the focus
of a superpower tug-of-war left the Soviet Union on Wednesday and
celebrated the end of an 11-year struggle to emigrate with a night
at the opera.
   Wearing radiant smiles, Yuri and Tanya Zieman and their
12-year-old daughter, Vera, stepped off an Aeroflot jet to a warm
welcome from Western friends, U.S. Embassy officials and members of
an organization helping emigre Soviet Jews.
   Asked how she felt on arriving in the West, Mrs. Zieman said
simply, ``Stunned.'' Her daughter, clutching a bouquet from
well-wishers, giggled, ``Excited.''
   The family will stay in Vienna until Friday, when they fly to
Boston for a reunion with an older daughter who emigrated in 1987
with her husband.
   A woman answering the telephone at their Vienna hotel said the
Ziemans went to the Palais Schwarzenberg, one of the city's finest
restaurants, for dinner. A waiter at the restaurant said the dinner
was only a prelude to a true Viennese delight: a performance of
Mozart's ``The Magic Flute'' at the opera.
   It was a rather more stylish celebration of the Ziemans'
departure than an impromptu champagne toast with several dozen
friends and relatives gathered at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport
Wednesday.
   ``I'm glad you're all here,'' Zieman told the group. ``I invite
you all to my new home.'' Zieman is a former computer specialist
who has help odd jobs since applying to emigrate, and was seriously
ill earlier in the year.
   In Vienna, he said he now feels ``much better. I'm so excited
that it sometimes seems to me that all my sicknesses are behind
me.''
   In Moscow, Mrs. Zieman called her departure ``one of the most
difficult moments of one's life. It's like your own funeral in a
way because most of the people who are here today I won't see again
_ my old teachers, relatives, friends.''
   The family spent a sleepless night clearing customs in Moscow
and saying farewell to friends, she said.
   U.S. diplomats said President Reagan had planned to visit the
Zieman family at their Moscow apartment during the summit meeting
in May and June to underscore U.S. concern for human rights in the
Soviet Union.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, became interested in the Ziemans'
plight after receiving a letter from Vera, who apparently caught
their sympathy with her plea to help a ``lifelong refusenik'' _ a
reference to the refusal by Soviet authorities to let her leave the
country almost since she was born.
   A high-ranking Soviet official told U.S. officials, however,
that if the president visited the family, the Ziemans would never
be allowed to emigrate.
   Reagan did not visit them, and two weeks after he left they were
told their application had been refused again and that they should
reapply in 1992. Within weeks, however, they received permission to
leave.
   Soviet officials previously had rejected their applications for
emigration, saying the Ziemans had access to state secrets.
   The Zieman family was among the most prominent of those
remaining in the Soviet Union in the year since officials began
granting permission for the best-known refuseniks to emigrate.

<TEXT>
   New Orleans has surpassed the $5.5 million
goal set for its share of costs for the Republican National
Convention, officials announced Wednesday.
   ``As of last night, we had $5,589,000 and contributions are
still coming in,'' said Ron Jones, chairman of the New Orleans
Special Events Fund.
   More than $3 million, including $800,000 from the state, was
raised since May 11, when oilman Pat Taylor, in charge of
fund-raising at first, complained that it was going too slowly and
that big corporations were reluctant to dig into their bank
accounts.
   Taylor's group, the Greater New Orleans Convention Fund, had
raised about $620,000 in about eight months.
   ``Ninety days ago, we were several hundred thousand dollars
short of being halfway to our goal,'' he said Wednesday. ``Amongst
the things I had to say then was that I knew this city would come
together. It has come together.''
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy said it was significant that New
Orleans' money came from donations instead of a tax like the one
Atlanta used to help pay for the Democratic National Convention.
   ``This day has proven that New Orleans is a major-league city.
That ... we are all wearing the same jersey. We are all pulling
together,'' he said.
   The money was needed for work pledged by the city to bring the
Republican Party to New Orleans for the conventionn Aug. 15-18.
   Those costs include $1 million each for the lighting system set
up for the convention and for electrical work; $900,000 in
construction, $700,000 for security and $630,000 for insurance.
   The 950 to 960 donors included all seven parishes in the New
Orleans metropolitan area and some outside of the region, Jones
said. He said corporate contributions ranged from $100 to $250,000.

   An Italian magistrate is investigating whether two
6th century B.C. statues were stolen from an archaeological dig in
Sicily and smuggled to California, a Culture Ministry spokeswoman
said Wednesday.
   The two marble heads were believed taken in 1979 from an illegal
excavation site in Morgantina, Sicily, said the spokeswoman, who
demanded anonymity.
   Judge Silvio Raffiotta, an investigating magistrate in Enna,
Sicily, was trying to determine whether the artifacts had turned up
in California through an illegal art-trafficking network, she said.
   Some reports have said the two statues wound up in the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., but the spokeswoman said that had
not been determined.
   She said she could provide no more details of the statues or the
investigation. ``The case is very delicate,'' the spokeswoman said.
``The investigation is covered by judicial secrecy.''
   Raffiotta's investigation is separate from another investigation
into the background of a 5th century B.C. Greek statue that
recently went on display at the Getty museum. Italian investigators
and Interpol are checking whether that statue, believed to be of
the goddess Aphrodite, was stolen from an illegal dig in Morgantina
in 1979.
   Italian newspapers reported Wednesday that the two marble heads
were of greater historical and artistic value than the statue.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Thorsteinn Palsson of Iceland
told President Reagan on Wednesday he hopes the United States and
the Soviet Union find agreement on slashing stockpiles of
long-range nuclear weapons.
   Palsson, who heads the government of a tiny nation of 250,000
with no defense force, said that maintaining world peace depends to
a large extent on the success of the superpowers' negotiations in
Geneva.
   Reagan, in a departure statement after hosting Palsson for a
meeting and lunch, noted that Iceland had hosted his historic
October 1986 summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``on
such short notice.''
   ``In the wake of the Moscow summit, I must note that the talks
that the general secretary and I had in Hodfi House (in Reykjavik)
were an important milestone in the development of our current
dialogue with the Soviet Union,'' the president said.
   Reagan credited solidarity in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization with helping the United States achieve the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces accord, eliminating an entire
class of medium- and shorter-range superpower missiles. That pact
was consummated during the May summit that Reagan and Gorbachev had
in Moscow.
   During the Reykjavik summit, Reagan and Gorbachev discussed
banning long-range nuclear missiles. That summit disintegrated amid
what the United States said was a Soviet insistence that Reagan
abandon his Star Wars missile defense program.
   In his salute to the 40-year-old Palsson, head of the
Independence Party and head of government since July 1987, Reagan
noted that he was the first Icelandic prime minister to make an
official working visit to the United States.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway, who specializes in
Canadian and European affairs, said Iceland has a ``special
interest'' in the strategic missile talks in Geneva ``in what is
done about sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles. But beyond
expressing that special interest, the prime minister did not go
into details.''
   The United States views Iceland as a small but highly
significant NATO ally, located strategically to monitor Soviet
ships and installations.
   Also on the agenda of Palsson's four-day Washington visit are
meetings with congressional leaders and with Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci. On Friday, Palsson travels to the Atlantic
Forces command in Norfolk, Va., for a tour of the aircraft carrier
Theodore Roosevelt.

   A nearly 13,000-acre fire at an Idaho national forest forced the
closing of a wilderness area Wednesday, and fires in Wyoming and
Montana threatened campers and a residential area, authorities said.
   Meanwhile, a 12,500-acre fire in Oregon's Deschutes National
Forest was declared 80 percent contained, but not before costing
the state more that $1.5 million.
   In Idaho, swirling wind pushed the 12,500-acre Battleaxe
wilderness fire closer to a backcountry guard station and airstrip
and forced fire bosses to close the Challis National Forest's
Indian Creek area for safety reasons.
   Manpower along the creek was quadrupled as the month-old fire
continued eluding supression.
   ``We've been having some squirrelly winds in there and the
fire's started to creep around,'' forest spokesman Jim James said.
``Our fuels are extra, extra dry.''
   In northwestern Idaho, 200 firefighters, including a prison
inmate crew, were gaining control of a 200-acre fire in the Nez
Perce National Forest.
   At Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park, fire managers were
counting on fire retardant and 700-gallon buckets of water to keep
a 30,150-acre blaze from scorching a campground in the park's
western section.
   Park officials said visitors to the 288-space Madison Junction
campground may have to go elsewhere if the North Fork fire moves
much closer.
   Spokesman Joan Anzelmo said winds of 15-25 mph were expected to
fan the fire Wednesday afternoon, but the 573 firefighters on the
blaze hoped to hold it about three miles from the campground.
   Several fires raged in Montana on Wednesday, but the worst had
more than 200 firefighters battling a potentially explosive blaze
in the populated, drought-parched Helena National Forest.
   The fire raced through 400 to 500 acres of timber within hours
after it started Tuesday afternoon, despite attacks by a helicopter
and four retardant bombers.
   ``The biggest problem is that there's a lot of fuel out there
that's very dry,'' said Dave Turner, fire information officer at
the Helena Interagency Fire Dispatch Center. `Seven or eight years
ago some late spring storms took down a lot of material, trees that
are now on the ground.
   ``Some local residents in the upper end of Warm Springs Creek
drainage are at risk at the present time,'' Turner said, adding
that crews did not yet expect to evacuate them.
   The largest forest fire in Oregon this year was 80 percent
contained Wednesday.
   The Paulina fire has cost $1.57 million to fight so far, said
Jill Haney, a Forest Service spokeswoman. It consumed 12,500 acres.
   A shift in winds and higher humidity helped crews slow the
spread of the fire.

   Heinz USA said Wednesday it has donated
$50,000 to help cover travel costs of migrant farm workers, whose
season picking tomatoes and cucumbers in the northern Midwest has
been cut short by the drought.
   The president of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, Baldemar
Velasquez, praised Heinz's efforts, but criticized Ohio for not
providing enough emergency relief to migrants.
   ``It is currently recognized that due to the drought, there will
be reduced earnings on the part of the local producers and farm
workers,'' said Ronald Brooks, Midwest Agricultural Manager for
Heinz USA in Fremont, a division of H.J. Heinz Co.
   ``This program is positioned as a supplement to these reduced
earnings. ... It will not replace the earnings. But it is our
intent that it will aid them in returning to their homes or their
next work site,'' Brooks told a news conference. ``It is clear that
this sum of money will not meet all the needs. However, it is a
start.''
   The money will be offered in northwest Ohio and southeast
Michigan through the Migrant Farmworker Emergency Assistance
Program. It will be administered by WSOS Community Action
Commission Inc., of Fremont, and Ohio Farmworker Opportunity Inc.,
of Bowling Green. Both agencies have agreed to donate
administrative costs.
   Growers are being asked to complete forms about family size and
income. Families with incomes at least 25 percent below normal as a
result of the drought will be eligible for payments of up to $150.
   In addition, Velasquez said the Farm Labor Organizing Committee
has donated $1,100 to the fund, and is seeking donations from other
processors in the area.
   Paul Blausey, president of the Fremont Pickle and Tomato Growers
Association, said the program will help retain people to harvest
crops in a very difficult year.
   About 10,000 migrant workers come to the region each year to
pick fruits and vegetables. But this year, because the drought has
severely damaged tomatoes and cucumbers, many have been unable to
find work and left before the harvest. Others have not made enough
money to return home.
   There are about 6,500 migrant workers in northwest Ohio and
southeast Michigan now, Velasquez said, citing estimates that 60
percent of them will earn less than 75 percent of their normal
income.
   Velasquez said he is disappointed that the state has not
provided enough emergency help for Ohio farm workers, who pick $85
million worth of crops each year.
   The union has recommended to the state drought task force that
money be provided for emergency unemployment compensation to the
farm workers who are unemployed or underemployed because of the
drought.
   ``We have not been contacted by the state in terms of the
necessary needs that are out there and what kind of programs could
be created to alleviate the situation,'' he said.
   ``We are running out of time. ... We are still in a crisis and a
race against time. Pretty soon it is going to be too late,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Marshall Says Fight Against Racism Far From Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said
Wednesday ``racism is broader and stronger than before'' and
America has a long way to go to achieve racial equality.
   ``We're not gaining ground, my friends. We might be losing
ground,'' Marshall, the only black ever to sit on the high court,
told the annual convention of the National Bar Association, an
organization of black lawyers and judges.
   ``One thing I'm sure of: This is no time to stop'' fighting for
racial equality, he said.
   Marshall urged his listeners to work toward ``a goal that is the
basis of true democracy.''
   That goal, he said, is to assure that ``a Negro child born ...
in a state like Mississippi or any other state like that, born to
the dumbest, poorest sharecropper'' has the same rights of a child
``born to a white parent, the wealthiest person in the United
States.''
   Marshall received an enthusiastic round of applause for the
remarks and a sustained ovation when he was given a crystal pyramid
as the ``justice of the 20th century.''
   Marshall, 80, was named to the Supreme Court by President
Johnson in 1967. For decades, his name was synonymous with the
fight for civil rights. He served as chief counsel of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People for 23 years.
   Marshall recalled that the National Bar Association, which now
has 12,000 members and conducted its annual meeting in one of
Washington's finest hotels, could not always afford such plush
surroundings.
   ``Indeed, we couldn't come in the front door,'' he said.
   Marshall rejected what he said was the suggestion by some that
the fight for racial equality has been won.
   ``Why do we have to have a National Bar Association today _ this
late date, as some people would think?'' Marshall asked. ``Well,
the answer is simple. It's not that late.''
   The association was created in 1925 to promote civil rights and
to provide black lawyers with an alternative to the American Bar
Association, the nation's largest lawyer group.

   A quick-thinking 9-year-old who spotted
a burglar hid behind a couch, waited until the man walked to the
other end of the house, then grabbed a phone and called police.
   ``This is an emergency. Somebody just broke into a house,''
Tyson, whose parents asked that his last name not be made public,
told police during the break-in Monday at his family's suburban
home.
   Tamara Garcia, the communications officer who took the call,
spoke to the boy softly, hoping to keep him calm and gather
information.
   ``Try and stay as quiet as you can,'' she advised. ``And stay on
the line with me, OK? Did you see the person?''
   Tyson, shaking with fear, managed to remain hidden and keep his
voice to a whisper for four minutes, giving Garcia his address.
   ``I could hear him throwing things around,'' Tyson said. ``I
knew he was back there.''
   Deputies say they caught Robert Petocchelli, 31, of Miami,
ransacking the master bedroom, said Sgt. Ken Deischer of the Palm
Beach County sheriff's office. Petocchelli, charged with armed
burglary and possession of burglary tools, was released from the
county jail after posting $13,500 bond Tuesday, a jail spokesman
said.
   Deischer said Petocchelli confessed and said he is an associate
of Peter Salerno, a cat burglar whose gang plucked millions of
dollars worth of jewelry from southern Florida homes during the
1970s.
   Tyson kept calm and stayed out of sight the whole time, Deischer
said, and Petocchelli never saw him.
   The officer praised the boy for possibly giving detectives a
break in a recent string of daytime burglaries outside Boca Raton.
   ``A kid has to have a little bit of courage to do something like
that,'' he said. ``He deserves some kind of recognition.''
   Deputies are asking their superiors to give Tyson a citation for
bravery. In the meantime, Tyson's parents are just glad their son
could handle the pressure.
   ``We told him he didn't act like a child, he acted like a man,''
his mother said.

<TEXT>
   Last year, Capt. Will C. Rogers III stood
before the USS Vincennes Association, a guest at its annual
reunion. This year, the group stands behind Rogers, skipper of the
vessel that shot down an Iranian jetliner.
   The association is open to crewmen from any of the four USS
Vincennes ships, the first of which was commissioned in 1826.
   As the more than 130 veterans arrived at a hotel this week for
the group's 15th reunion, they passed by a copy of a telegram the
organization sent to Rogers and his crew expressing support after
the accidental downing of the jet July 3 over the Persian Gulf. All
290 people aboard the plane died.
   A Pentagon inquiry is reported to have blamed human error caused
by the stress of first-time combat. The inquiry found no evidence
that the ship's sophisticated Aegis radar system malfunctioned,
sources said.
   ``Our hearts are heavy for the captain, but we feel he made the
proper decision,'' Antonio A. Coito, first vice president of the
association and a gunner on the third USS Vincennes. ``His first
decision is to the ship and crew and equipment.
   ``I would prefer to make a mistake rather than have men injured
and damaged. We feel the captain should not be reprimanded or
penalized in any way,'' Coito, 62, of Charlotte, Mich., said
Tuesday.
   Ed Michalowski, 76, of East Islip, N.Y., agreed. ``You only have
a certain amount of time _ seconds and minutes _ from the time you
sight something until the time you have to go into action,'' said
Michalowski, a fireman 1st class aboard the third Vincennes, the
light cruiser CL-64.
   ``You saw what happened to the Stark. He waited,'' Michalowski
added.
   The USS Stark, a guided missile frigate, was struck by a missile
from an Iraqi fighter during Persian Gulf duty in 1987. Thirty
seven crew members died and the captain was relieved of his duty
and retired from the Navy.
   The reunion runs through Thursday.

   George Bush worked Wednesday on his acceptance speech for next
week's Republican National Convention while Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis forecast a ``very tough, competitive''
campaign as a poll showed his once-mighty lead shrinking to single
digits.
   Republicans crafted an anti-tax hike, anti-abortion platform a
few blocks from their New Orleans convention hall, and voted to
proclaim themselves the champion of women as well as minorities.
Public opinion polls show Bush trailing Dukakis badly among women
voters.
   ``Let's be honest,'' Republican chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said
in a speech to the party's national committee. ``Last month
belonged to Michael Dukakis and the Democrats. They had their show,
they had their laughs, but the last laugh is still the best
laugh...This campaign now belongs to us.''
   Republicans also said they have $13.5 million cash on hand
toward a goal of $70 million or more to help elect Bush and other
GOP candidates this fall.
   The cavernous Superdome where Republicans will nominate Bush and
his as-yet unknown vice presidential running mate was still a
construction zone. Thousands of red-backed chairs were installed on
the floor beneath a huge podium. Workmen laid what seemed like
miles of red carpet to cover the temporary walkways.
   The most recent public opinion poll gave Bush cause for cheer.
   A Gallup poll gave Dukakis an edge over Bush of 49 percent to 42
percent in a survey taken Aug. 5-7. That contrasts with a 17-point
Dukakis bulge in the days immediately following the Democratic
National Convention in July.
   There was little doubt that the GOP platform committee was
sketching a conservative blueprint for America, and at least one
participant was unhappy. ``This is the last platform hurrah,
believe me, of the far right,'' said liberal Sen. Lowell Weicker of
Connecticut.
   The platform committee refined one plank to say Republicans are
``the natural champion of blacks, minorities, women and ethnic
Americans.'' In agreeing to the change, they overrode an objection
of James Summers of Bellevue, Wash., who said the revision amounted
to ``absolutely pandering to a single constituency where we appear,
according to the pollsters, to be having a problem.''
   The early platform draft also called for ``rapid and certain
deployment'' of Star Wars. The vice president has urged deployment
``as soon as feasible.''
   Republicans also released what they said was a GOP staff
estimate of the cost of the implicit promises of the Democratic
platform _ $43.1 billion in 1989 alone. Ironically, Bush has
criticized the Democrats for drafting a platform that lacked any
specifics.

   Farmers in Iowa are eligible to apply for
Farmers Home Administration emergency crop loans because of
drought, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng announced Wednesday.
The state was the ninth to get the designation.
   Lyng said farmers in Iowa's 99 counties have eight months in
which to apply for the loans to help cover part of their actual
losses. To be eligible, they must have multiperil or federal crop
insurance, if available, to offset crop losses.
   Further, to be eligible for FmHA loans, farmers must be able to
repay the emergency loans as well as any other loans they have,
have adequate security and be unable to get credit elsewhere, he
said.
   FmHA emergency drought loans also have been made available to
farmers in Alabama, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio,
West Virginia and Wisconsin.

   The United States on Wednesday urged Arab
nations and Japan to donate money to the U.N. military observer
group that will monitor the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.
   The United States is the most delinquent contributor to the
U.N.'s regular budget, accounting for $467 million of the $602
million in unpaid assessments.
   ``If we continue at this rate,'' the United Nations will be
bankrupt before October, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   The U.N. also is monitoring the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan, preparing to supervise independence elections in
Namibia, submitting peace proposals in the Western Sahara guerrilla
war and preparing to help warring parties in Cambodia reach a
power-sharing agreement.
   The General Assembly will reconvene in a special session next
Tuesday to assess its 159 members for the $74 million that the U.N.
Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group will cost in its first six months.
   The United States expects to be assessed about $23 million of
that amount, said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley in
Washington.
   Mrs. Oakley said the United States also owes $70 million to the
U.N. peacekeeping budget, which is separate from the regular
operating budget.
   The 350 U.N. observers are to be in place within a week. The
cease-fire in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war is to take effect
Aug. 20.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We
do intend to urge the gulf states, who are the chief beneficiaries
of this settlement, to share in the cost through voluntary
contributions.
   ``We'll be giving the same message to other countries like Japan
and others who have an interest in the gulf,'' he said. Japan
imports nearly all its oil from the gulf region.
   Japan donated $20 million in April to U.N. peace efforts,
designating half for the Iran-Iraq peace effort and half for the
Afghanistan accords.
   Those funds are being used as the seed money to begin the
Iran-Iraq cease-fire monitoring effort, said Giuliani.
   The Security Council met Wednesday in informal consultations to
approve the secretary-general's list of nations sending officers to
monitor the cease-fire.
   The nations are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, India,
Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway,
Poland, Senegal, Sweden, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Zambia.
   The United States' U.N. dues are more than $200 million a year,
a quarter of the world body's regular budget.
   The United States has said it is holding back funding to press
for reform in the budget-making process, personnel cuts and changes
in personnel practices that it says leave Soviet U.N. employees
under Moscow's control.

<TEXT>
   What started out as a cruel hoax on the
people of St. Marys could get a happy ending in November if popular
TV weatherman Willard Scott makes it for a visit.
   A spokesman for NBC in New York said Scott, the genial
weatherman on the ``Today'' show, wanted to do something to ease
the disappointment of residents, who found out earlier this month
that news of a pending visit by Scott was a hoax.
   ``We are trying to arrange a visit to St. Marys for sometime in
November,'' said spokesman John Bianchi. ``It's definitely in
response to that unfortunate incident. Willard felt bad, so he said
to try to work out the details because he didn't want to disappoint
the folks down there.''
   Bianchi said Tuesday that Scott will not do be able to do a show
in St. Marys, but would spend a day getting to know the people. He
said details will be worked out later.
   In late July, a woman visited the tiny coastal town, which
borders Florida's east coast, and said she was with NBC. She began
making detailed plans for Scott and newsman John Palmer to visit
the area and do a documentary on the impact of the Navy's Kings Bay
submarine base on the community.
   Martha Newsome, executive director of the Kingsland Tour and
Travel Association, said people in St. Marys and her nearby town
developed ``a real Willard-mania'' because of Scott's reported
visit.
   She described them as ``flabbergasted'' after they discovered
that Scott had no plans to visit Georgia.
   The mysterious woman, who stayed in town 10 days, suddenly
checked out of her motel Aug. 2 and has not been seen since.
   ``Today'' spokeswoman Kathy Graham said the woman does not work
for NBC.

   Jo Henderson, a stage and film actress who was

police said.
   Ms. Henderson appeared on Broadway and in many off-Broadway and

shortly before her death.
   Her performance in 1976 as the widowed mother of four young
daughters in ``Ladyhouse Blues,'' produced by the Phoenix Theater

<HEAD>Tired Airliner Crew Mistook Highway for Runway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tired cockpit crew working illegally long hours
mistook a busy British highway for a nearby airport runway and were
preparing to land their packed airliner on it, aviation experts
said Wednesday.
   They said the captain was looking at the M-56 highway instead of
Manchester Airport when he told air traffic controllers he had the
runway in sight and would land visually.
   The highway landing was aborted at the last moment after the
co-pilot realized the error, the Royal Air Force Institute of
Aviation Medicine said. The aircraft touched down safely at the
airport.
   The report quoted the co-pilot as saying he realized the flight
would mean he would exceed his limit of 11{ hours continuous duty,
but the pilot was under commercial pressure and asked him to say he
came on duty one hour later than he did.
   The institute passed the report to the Civil Aviation Authority.
The authority finances the institute program for the discovery and
study of stress problems. The number of people aboard the airliner
was not given, nor were names, airline or date of the flight
disclosed.
   Identifying details would never be published because air crews
were invited on a pledge of secrecy to submit such accounts, the
authority said.
   The institute said it gets about 250 reports of this nature each
year. They are printed in Royal Air Force bulletins subscribed to
by 13,000 people around the world and enable pilots to learn from
the errors of their colleagues.

<TEXT>
   Republican Party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf
Jr. on Wednesday defended attacks on Michael Dukakis as ``the
unvarnished truth'' and said the Democratic presidential nominee is
trying to deflect legitimate criticism by accusing opponents of
negative campaigning.
   In a speech to the Republican National Committee, Fahrenkopf
cited Democratic attacks on Vice President George Bush and said,
``See if you can find any better examples of negative campaigning.
And the Democrats have the nerve to point the finger at us.''
   Meeting less than a week before the opening of their convention,
GOP officials also were told the national committee began the month
with $13.5 million in the bank and would spend more than $70
million to help party candidates at all levels.
   Larry Bathgate, chairman of the party finance committee, said
his group raised $34.9 million during the first seven months of the
election year and expected to raise up to $6 million at a luncheon
the final day of the convention.
   A sampling of national committee members all cited Bush's speech
accepting the presidential nomination as the most important moment
of the convention.
   ``We all want to hear a good strong speech, issues oriented,''
said Jennifer Dunn, Washington GOP chairman.
   Spencer Abraham, Michigan GOP chairman, said Bush muist use the
convention ``to establish that he has become the head of the
Republican Party.''
   Fahrenkopf cited Bush's appearance ealier in the week before the
GOP platform committee when the vice president referred to Dukakis
as ``the stealth candidate'' and said the Massachusetts governor
was invisible on the issues.
   ``Dukakis is already crying foul,'' said Fahrenkopf. ``But how
can Dukakis call this negative campaigning and go unchallenged?
   ``Yes, the vice president's remarks were critical. ... But the
vice president used a memorable rhetorical device to make a point
grounded in fact _ that Dukakis will not discuss the issues.''
   Fahrenkopf said criticism of the Massachusetts furlough program
under which convicted murderers were allowed to spend weekends away
from prison ``was not mudslinging, because it was the unvarnished
truth.''
   The GOP chairman also accused Dukakis of using negative tactics
during the Democratic primary campaign and said, ``Dukakis is using
the oldest trick in politics: he and his people say the most
outlandish things, and then denounce any response as mudslinging.''

   Abortion protesters from several states rallied
with evangelist Jerry Falwell on Wednesday, 57 were arrested for
blocking clinic entrances and the number jailed since
demonstrations began rose to more than 300.
   Asked if he planned to join those being arrested Wednesday,
Falwell said, ``Not today, but I'm willing to be, and I'm sure
before it's over it will happen.''
   Police said 57 people, many clutching Bibles, were charged with
criminal trespass and giving a false name after they blocked the
entrances to Feminist Women's Health Center.
   About 200 people picketed or held signs with graphic displays of
aborted fetuses. They cheered, clapped and sang hymns as their
companions were arrested and taken away in prison buses.
   While some protesters blocked entrances, others confronted
patients as they tried to enter the clinic, shouting, ``Don't kill
your baby! We can help you! We can give you anything you need!''
   Several patients were escorted through the protesters by clinic
workers wearing identifying T-shirts, and at one point, police
helped lift a patient over seated demonstrators.
   Wednesday's arrests pushed to 333 the number of people charged
in seven scattered days of protests, which began last month during
the Democratic National Convention. Most of the seven Atlanta
clinics that perform abortions have been targeted during the
demonstrations, which are unannounced but highly organized.
   In a related protest in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 42 demonstrators
remained in jail Wednesday in the wake of a three-day vigil and
march to free Joan Andrews, who is serving a five-year sentence for
leading a 1986 raid on a Pensacola abortion clinic.
   Several dozen protesters remain in jail in Atlanta because they
refuse to identify themselves, instead giving their names as Baby
John Doe or Baby Jane Doe. Organizers say those still in jail are
committed to remaining indefinitely.
   Among those arrested Wednesday were ministers and some in a
busload of people from Mississippi who arrived Wednesday morning.
Pickets said they were from North Carolina, South Carolina,
Virginia, Kansas and Florida as well as Georgia.
   Falwell presented Randall Terry, leader of the protest
organizing group Operation Rescue, with a check for $10,000 to help
pay legal expenses. Terry was arrested during a protest last week,
charged with being a party to a crime.
   Saying he came to Atlanta to ``sanction and endorse the new
concept in the pro-life movement of non-violent civil
disobedience,'' Falwell promised to use his television ministry to
rally support for Operation Rescue and other non-violent abortion
protests.
   ``In the next few months, this will be breaking out all over
America,'' said Falwell, a Baptist preacher from Lynchburg, Va.
``I'm challenging my preacher friends everywhere, who've stood with
us on every other issue, to stand up now in this one and endorse
non-violent civil disobedience.''
   A clinic spokeswoman said the protests had provided free
publicity, and that the normally competitive clinics have begun
referring patients to each other when necessary.
   ``These kind of tactics don't dissuade anybody from having an
abortion, it just makes them wait longer,'' said Ann Rose, director
of community education for Midtown Hospital, which performs
abortions and other services and has been the site of previous
demonstrations.
   ``We're busier than ever. It's good publicity for us in a lot of
ways. People now know where we are and they know a lot more about
abortions than they did before,'' she said. ``When they get
pregnant, they know who to call now. They don't have to go looking
through the Yellow Pages; they heard it on TV.''

Senate OK</HEAD>

   The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday
unanimously recommended confirmation of Richard L. Thornburgh as
attorney general and set the stage for quick Senate approval of the
former Pennsylvania governor and three other top Justice Department
nominees.
   Thornburgh would succeed Edwin Meese III, who announced his
resignation after an independent counsel investigating his conduct
declined to file criminal charges against the controversial
attorney general.
   The committee approved Thornburgh by voice vote without debate.
Afterwards, acting panel chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., urged
that the Senate act before recessing this week for the summer.
   The panel previously recommended approval of Harold Christensen
as deputy attorney general, Francis A. Keating II as associate
attorney general and Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. as chief of the
criminal division. All three nominations are before the Senate.
   Thornburgh was a two-term Republican governor of Pennsylvania, a
chief of the Justice Department's criminal division and currently
is director of the Institute of Politics of Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government.
   Thornburgh's easy approval in the committee showed there was no
aftershock from his confirmation hearing last week. During that
hearing he was quizzed repeatedly about a published report that as
head of the criminal division he had a role in withholding from
Congress a 1975 report on drug trafficking by Panamanian leaders.
   Thornburgh said portions of the report were withheld at the time
because of pending investigations, and he insisted that any
decision to keep the information from Congress would have been made
by the attorney general at the time, Edward Levi.
   Thornburgh said an arrangement eventually was made for the
Senate to receive the report.
   The nominee also pledged at the confirmation hearing to avoid
the ethical questions that dogged Meese, who was constantly dodging
conflict-of-interest allegations.
   Thornburgh promised senators he would hold the Justice
Department to ``the highest ethical standards'' and said he would
not interfere with an internal investigation of Meese's conduct.
   He also declared, ``I'm a strong supporter of President Reagan.
His agenda is my agenda.''
   Thornburgh said fighting the ``scourge of narcortics'' would be
his top priority. He promised a vigorous battle against organized
crime, public corruption and white-collar crime, while safeguarding
civil liberties.
   The predecessors of Christensen and Dennis _ former Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns and ex-criminal division chief
William Weld _ announced their resignations last March to protest
Meese's continued tenure in the face of the independent counsel's
investigation.
   Keating would replace Steve Trott, who now is a federal
appellate judge.

<HEAD>Four of Five in Survey Rate Safety a Serious Air Travel Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   More than four of every five people consider
safety to be a serious problem with air travel, according to an
opinion poll published Wednesday by an association of private
pilots.
   The random telephone survey, conducted by a Washington polling
firm in early June, also showed that people who regarded safety as
a far greater problem with air travel than flight delays.
   The poll was commissioned by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association, which represents 270,000 people who own or fly private
aircraft.
   AOPA president John Baker said the poll demonstrated the
public's widespread concern about aviation safety among the public,
but added that those worries were not justified.
   ``By and large safety is not one of the major problems we have
in the industry. We don't have a major safety problem,'' Baker told
reporters.
   Instead, he said, the aviation industry faces serious congestion
problems that will become worse in years to come.
   The Air Transport Association, which represents the major
airlines, said the public perception that aviation safety has
deteriorated was unfounded.
   ``The airline's safety record has continued to improve in recent
years by any measurement one uses,'' it said. ``This year, for
instance, there have been some 4 million flights by major carriers
with no passenger fatalities and just one crew member fatality.''
   The poll was conducted June 6-17 by the Washington firm of
Hamilton, Frederick & Schneiders and involved 1,000 people 18 or
older reached by telephone across the country.
   According to the AOPA, 82 percent of those surveyed said air
safety was a serious problem, and 52 percent said air travel was
less safe than it was five years ago.
   Of those polled, 16 percent said flight delays were a ``very
serious'' problm and 48 percent said they were ``somewhat serious.''
   The survey showed that many people believe the solution to
flight delays is for airlines to provide more realistic flight
schedules and for airports to be expanded.
   When asked how best to relieve airport congestion, 68 percent
favored construction or expansion of airports and development of an
improved air traffic control system over limitations on flights
into an airport.
   Better than four of every five individuals cited a concern about
maintenance when asked about air safety, with 44 percent saying the
first step was to improve maintenance practices.
   At a news conference, pollster Greg Schneiders said the concerns
about aircraft maintenance reflected in the poll may have stemmed
partly from news stories at the time about the aerial breakup of an
Aloha Airlines jet and federal investigations into maintenance
problems at Eastern Airlines.

<HEAD>Aid Agency Official Plans to Plead Guilty to Embezzlement, Lawyer
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A former employee of the Agency for
International Development intends to plead guilty to charges that
he embezzled $1.2 million from the government, his lawyer said
Wednesday.
   Defense attorney David Addis said former AID financial officer
William J. Burns would plead guilty to charges of embezzlement,
filing a false claim and tax evasion contained in a criminal
information filed in U.S. District Court.
   ``It's a tragedy for him and the whole family,'' Addis said.
``He will be doing everything he can to make an unfortuate
situation as right as he possibly can.''
   The defense lawyer declined to say whether Burns had agreed to
try to make restitution for the embezzled money. Addis said the
terms of the guilty plea would be outlined at a proceeding Thursday
before U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson.
   Justice Department prosecutor James Cole refused comment on the
case.
   The criminal information charged that Burns, 48, embezzled $1.2
million between 1982 and 1988 and evaded federal income taxes
totaling $475,685. He also is charged with filing false claim forms
in June to obtain more than $56,000.
   Burns was arrested last month. The charges resulted from a
six-month investigation that began after his lavish lifestyle
attracted the attention of AID officials.
   Late last year, AID officials conducting a routine security
check noticed that Burns, whose annual salary was $35,108, lived in
a neighborhood of $500,000 homes in Burtonsville, Md. His house was
worth $330,000, according to investigators.
   Burns spent $80,000 to landscape the property, according to
court testimony last month.
   At the time of his arrest, AID said Burns had purchased
``expensive cars, travel, exquisite home furnishings and other
embellishments'' normally beyond the reach of government officials
of his position.
   According to testimony before a federal magistrate last month,
Burns filed phony claims for travel expense money. Checks were
issued to a Vincent Kauffman, in whose name Burns had opened a bank
account.
   Burns was photographed while using an automatic teller card to
withdraw cash from the account, a government investigator testified.
   AID, an agency of the State Department, administers foreign aid
programs.

<HEAD>Government Halts AIDS Condom Study To Ponder Ethical Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A clinical study on the effectiveness of
condom use for prevention of AIDS has been halted while government
officials search for a way to do the research without compromising
medical ethics, officials said Wednesday.
   Jeffrey Perlman, chief of contraceptive evaluation for the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said a
panel studying the problem decided to cancel condom tests among a
selected homosexual population in Los Angeles because the research
might encourage some people in the study to not use condoms while
engaging in high-risk sex.
   Perlman said the study, as originally designed, would have an
``intervention'' group that would be given condoms and spermicide
and a ``control'' group that would not receive these items.
   The goal was to later compare the amount of AIDS infection
between the two groups.
   Perlman said a National Institutes of Health committee worried
that ``there might be too many people (in the control group) who
were getting infected because they were not using the condoms.
   ``That raised the ethical concern,'' he said. ``The concern was
not that the condoms were not going to work, but what would happen
to the people who were not going to use the condoms.''
   Perlman said that delaying the test does not mean the federal
government has changed its official policy that advises the use of
condoms when engaging in high-risk sex. High-risk sex would include
relations with homosexuals, with many partners or with partners who
are promiscuous, or with intervenous drug users. Perlman said the
government still recommends the use of condoms and spermicide.
   The clinical studies were to be conducted under the direction of
the University of California, Los Angeles, under a $2.6 million
contract. UCLA already has done laboratory quality tests on condoms
and was to supervise the clinical tests among gay men.
   Dr. Roger Detels, professor of public health at UCLA who was to
direct the study, said he agreed with the NIH decision.
   He said a classical intervention test requires that half of a
selected group use the device being tested, and that half not use
it.
   ``From other studies ... it's clear that if you engage in
high-risk sexual activities you are better off with condoms than
without,'' Detels said in a telephone interview. ``Based on that
fact, it is not ethical to have a control group in the usual sense
of a control group. ... The study has to take into consideration
that the control group has to be encouraged to use condoms as well
as your intervention group.''
   Perlman said the original study has been withdrawn and is now
being redesigned to adjust for the ethical concerns. He said the
NIH will be asking for bids on the new study and he hopes UCLA will
reapply.
   The new study, he said, probably will be a modified intervention
test in which both groups in the study will receive education on
the advisability of using condoms. But he said only half of the
group will receive condoms and spermicide from the administrators
of the research. The control group will be encouraged to use the
protection, but will have to purchase it commercially.
   Perlman said there also will be a retrospective study in which
people in high-risk groups will be interviewed to determine how
their sexual practices, including the use of condoms and
spermicidesm, may have affected their exposure to AIDS.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a
virus that is spread through semen, blood, blood products or from
birthing mother to child. The disease destroys the body's immune
system, causing the victim to contract and die from infection or
rare types of cancer. No one is known to have recovered from the
disease.

<HEAD>Complaints From Homeless Bring Cancellation Of HUD Sales Promotion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with the threat of a lawsuit from
advocates for the homeless, the federal government on Wednesday
called off a sales campaign officials hoped would unload 15,000
foreclosed single-family dwellings this weekend.
   The campaign had been aimed at building up Federal Housing
Administration funds and helping first-time homebuyers get homes at
reduced prices, said a Housing and Urban Development spokesman.
   The spokesman, Bill Glavin, said all HUD field offices were
instructed to cancel a planned weekend promotion of 27,000 of the
properties the agency has taken over because owners failed to make
payments on them. The homes are still on the market, but the
promotion, dubbed the ``coordinated national sales weekend,'' was
called off, said Glavin.
   ``The action is being taken as a result of the threat of
litigation by homeless advocacy groups, since any protracted
litigation could have an adverse affect on the future sales of
foreclosed properties,'' said a HUD announcement.
   Roberta Youmans of the National Housing Law Project said her
group, which is based in Berkeley, Calif., had written HUD to
object to the campaign and threaten legal action. The group assists
lawyers helping indigent clients with housing cases.
   ``We received calls from homeless individuals saying HUD was
selling units and they couldn't get them,'' Ms. Youmans said in a
telephone interview.
   She said many HUD sales result in homes being sold to
speculators, and sometimes the homes themselves have been taken
away from people who were originally homeless and couldn't make the
payments, putting them back on the streets. Others are being rented
to people who are rendered homeless by the sales, she said.
   ``We have a crisis here, with three million families out on the
streets,'' Ms. Youmans said.
   She said HUD had not formally answered the letter, but advocates
for the homeless hope to meet with officials to discuss ways more
houses owned by the government might be made available to the
homeless.
   ``The legal issues raised in our letter still remain,'' she said.
   HUD said it was reviewing its programs for making its foreclosed
properties available to the homeless. Both lease and lease-purchase
programs are available, and about 90 percent of HUD-owned houses
can be purchased at a 10 percent discount by local agencies that
would make them available to the homeless, HUD said.
   Foreclosed government properties are generally available through
bids that are to be opened on a specific date for each property.
Before the program was stopped, HUD had asked its field offices to
do everything they could to promote house sales this weekend,
including offering incentives, holding open houses, and placing ads
for the properties.

   About 500 guests at the St. Moritz Hotel were
packed off to other lodgings Wednesday after a smoky electrical
fire left the 33-story building without power.
   The 792-room hotel overlooking Central Park was evacuated
shortly after 11 a.m. when fire broke out in a cable leading from
an electrical transformer into the basement, authorities said.
   The fire, which was controlled in slightly more than an hour,
sent some smoke into the lower floors and cut off power to the St.
Moritz and four nearby buildings, according to Fire Department
spokesman Efrain Parrilla. The cause was not immediately determined.
   One woman was taken to a hospital for smoke inhalation. She was
listed in stable condition. It was unclear what the woman was doing
at the hotel.
   Another woman was trapped in an elevator on the 22nd floor for
about half an hour after the power outage, said Robert Mason, the
Fire Department's deputy borough commander for Manhattan. She was
not injured, Mason said.
   A spokesman for the hotel, executive vice president Frowen Feld,
said the St. Moritz was completely booked Wednesday but few guests
were in their rooms when the fire broke out.
   A loudspeaker system failed because there was no electricity, so
hotel workers knocked on room doors to evacuate people, Feld said.
   Feld said the St. Moritz is equipped with smoke alarms and
sprinklers, but none were activated because the fire and most of
the smoke was confined to a sub-basement.
   Dan Klores, a spokesman for St. Moritz owner Donald Trump, said
electricity was expected to be restored Wednesday night.
   In the meantime, Klores said, the St. Moritz offered its guests
lodging at the Plaza or Grand Hyatt hotels and about 500 people
agreed to be transferred. Several hundred others remained at the
St. Moritz, he said.

<HEAD>New Genes Can Help Chickens Resist Costly Virus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Poultry scientists have given chickens new
genes so they can resist avian leukosis, a virus that costs egg
producers $50 million to $100 million annually, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesay.
   The so-called transgenic chickens _ meaning there has been a
transfer of genes from one organism to another _ were developed at
the department's Regional Poultry Research Laboratory at East
Lansing, Mich.
   ``These are the first transgenic chickens with economic
potential,'' said Lyman B. Crittenden, a poultry geneticist of the
department's Agricultural Research Service, the agency that
operates the laboratory.
   Avian leukosis virus cannot infect humans, but it can cause
tumors and other symptoms in chickens, reducing egg production and
quality, he said.
   The genetically altered chickens not only are resistant to the
virus but pass on the characteristic to their offspring, Crittenden
said.
   In tests completed this year, transgenic White Leghorns,
descendants of the original embryos that underwent genetic
transplants, ``completely resisted repeated exposures to laboratory
and field strains of the virus in tests lasting 40 weeks,''
Crittenden said.
   The birds appear normal in growth, health and reproductive
ability, the geneticist said. Even so, several years of tests by
poultry breeders will be required before similar transgenic
chickens will be laying eggs for consumers.

<HEAD>Govs. Cuomo, Kean Announce Stringent Medical Waste Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Govs. Mario Cuomo and Thomas Kean, reacting to
the beach pollution which has marred the summer in their states,
said Wednesday a cradle-to-grave accounting of all infectious
medical waste was now required in New York and New Jersey.
   ``The purpose is to say to people, we will watch you with the
intent of catching and prosecuting you if this waste is not
disposed of properly,'' New York's Cuomo told a crowded shipboard
news conference in New York Harbor.
   Kean, speaking with the Statue of Liberty in the background,
agreed: ``We will no longer tolerate the careless, unsupervised and
often just outrageous way these wastes are being handled.''
   The plan was announced following a month-long rash of beach
closings in both states due to medical waste and raw sewage in the
water. Syringes, blood vials, bandages and other infectious waste
have washed ashore in New Jersey and New York; beaches in New York
also had dead rats on the sand.
   Beach attendance has been down significantly in both states
because of the washed-up waste, officials have said.
   The problem has cropped up elsewhere, too.
   Syringes, vials of drugs and other medical debris have washed
ashore from the Gulf of Mexico onto beaches in Florida's Panhandle
during the past several weeks, authorities there said Wednesday.
But one official, Escambia County environmental health director
Richard Dunlap, said there was no cause for alarm from a health
standpoint.
   ``It's medical waste; it's not infectious waste,'' he said.
``The storm has brought in so much stuff (in addition to medical
debris).'' Tropical Storm Beryl churned up the Gulf earlier this
week before dissipating.
   Twenty-six miles of North Carolina beaches were soiled by waste
dumped by offshore Navy vessels, and since Sunday, Marines have
been working to clean up the sand.
   Navy regulations allow dumping of biodegradable garbage within
12 miles of shore, said Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, a Navy spokesman.
Other trash may be dumped 25 miles or more from shore, but medical
refuse that may be contaminated or connected with dangerous drugs
is held for incineration in port, he said.
   ``It's not a contamination problem, and I can say it's
definitely not related to the beach problems in New York and New
Jersey,'' Lloyd said.
   As part of the New York-New Jersey plan, any facility which
generates medical waste, any company which transports it and any
place which disposes of it will be required to fill out forms at
each step of the process.
   The hospital will then keep the final form _ completed at all
three stops _ on file for the state, providing a record of the
waste from inception to disposal. If the hospital does not receive
the form within seven days of disposal, the state must be notified.
   The plan went into effect immediately in both New York and New
Jersey, the governors said.
   ``We are powerless no longer as needles and bandages wash up on
our beaches,'' said Kean. ``We will be able to punish the people
who have been turning so many holidays into horror stories.''
   But both Cuomo and Kean acknowledged the new ``manifest system''
did not carry any stricter penalties for illegal dumpers _ it
simply would make it easier to catch them.
   And both governors used the occasion to call for tougher fines
and possible jail terms against violators. Kean also reiterated his
request for creation of a New Jersey coastal commission to monitor
the state's beachfronts.
   The gubernatorial get-together came one day after the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency said it had no plans to regulate
medical waste disposal. Kean and Cuomo disagreed with that.
   ``We want federal legislation only when it's needed, and here it
is needed,'' Cuomo said.

   Michael Dukakis, shrugging off a poll
showing his lead eroding in the presidential race, on Wednesday
defended his decision not to start cleaning up the Boston Harbor
during his first term as governor.
   The Democratic presidential nominee helped break ground to begin
a major phase of the multibillion-dollar cleanup of the harbor, now
considered the nation's filthiest, and spent most of his day at the
Statehouse tending to state business before heading out on a
five-state campaign trip Thursday.
   He dismissed a cautionary advisory from a watchdog panel that
said state revenues may not live up to projections in the new state
budget.
   ``This is Massachusetts, not Washington,'' Dukakis said. ``We're
going to balance our budget and pay our bills.''
   A new Gallup survey put Dukakis's support at 49 percent and
George Bush's at 42 percent in telephone interviews with 1,004
registered voters Aug. 5-7. Only two weeks ago, Dukakis was
sporting a 17-point margin over Bush, a 54-37 result in a Gallup
Poll. Each survey had a 3 percentage point margin of error.
   ``The race has always been tight,'' Dukakis said. ``This is
going to be a very tough, competitive 90 days.''
   Dukakis traditionally dismisses polls as meaningless, although
he did offer his interpretation of the latest survey.
   ``The only thing that these numbers tell you is that the
Democratic ticket is competitive in every region of the country and
in every state of the country,'' he said.
   To that end, Dukakis was readying for a campaign trip that will
take him to three key states in his effort to break the Republican
stronghold in Electoral College politics _ New York, New Jersey and
Florida. Dukakis also was to visit Connecticut and Virginia before
heading to Cape Cod Friday night to spend the weekend with his wife.
   He left the office at midmorning to attend the groundbreaking at
Deer Island in Winthrop, future site of a massive sewage treatment
plant included in the harbor cleanup plan. Construction beginning
there now is for a giant pier for barges carrying components of the
plant.
   After a speedboat ride across the harbor from Boston to
Winthrop, Dukakis defended his decision not to build new treatment
plants during his first term.
   ``Nobody could really tell us what to do to clean up this
place,'' Dukakis said. ``There were very respected people, experts
in the field, who disagreed.''
   Lee Atwater, George Bush's campaign manager, said in a
statement: ``If it takes the governor of Massachusetts 11 years to
clean up his own harbor, Americans must question his commitment to
the even larger environmental questions which face our nation.''
   Atwater said the delay ``will increase the average Boston water
bill from $300 to nearly $1,200 over the next eight years.''
   ``If I were from Massachusetts, I'd say the whole thing stinks
in more ways than one,'' Atwater said.
   Earlier this year Dukakis said that in hindsight it was a
mistake not to begin the cleanup during the first term. But he
seemed unwilling to go that far Wednesday, complaining of
``revisionist history about this project'' that blamed him for
delays. That criticism, Dukakis said, ``may or may not be connected
with the presidential campaign.''
   The harbor cleanup, with a current pricetag of $6 billion, is
the largest public works project in Massachusetts history. Dukakis,
as he did last week in California, boasted of the jobs it would
create.
   ``There are jobs and economic opportunity in environmental
quality,'' Dukakis said.''
   Dukakis decided against going forward with the plan in the
mid-70s because of disputes over whether secondary sewage treatment
was needed to clean up the harbor.
   His administration began the process of requesting a waiver to
Clean Water Act requirements for sewage treatment and the waiver
request was filed by then-Gov. Edward J. King shortly after Dukakis
left office in 1979.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency ultimately rejected
the waiver request and a subsequent appeal and the state now is
under a federal court timetable to complete new primary and
secondary treatment plants and to stop dumping sludge into the
harbor. The project is scheduled to be completed by 1999.
   Dukakis, faced with the EPA decision and state and federal court
action, has made the harbor cleanup a priority since returning to
office in 1983.

   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan said Wednesday he
would seek to block confirmation of all executive appointments
unless the White House releases an FBI report on a former official
targeted in a Pentagon procurement investigation.
   Levin, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, sought the report on Melvyn Paisley, former assistant
secretary of the Navy, from the FBI and the White House.
   He said both refused to give him the report, which was a
background check the FBI conducted on Paisley during his 1981
confirmation hearings for the Navy post. Levin said the FBI may
have heard allegations of misconduct on Paisley's part, but the
information was not available to most committee members at the time
the panel considered the nomination.
   ``In light of the White House refusal, the integrity of the
confirmation process has been called into question,'' Levin said.
``Future confirmations are at risk until this particular issue is
satisfactorily resolved.''
   Levin's press secretary, Willie Blacklow, said the senator
intended the statement as a threat.
   The senator believes Paisley's confirmation may show an
underlying flaw in the confirmation process, Blacklow said. ``It
would only be fair that we hold up confirmations until we find out
where the flaw lies,'' he said.
   Senate tradition allows members to block consideration of a
nomination for reasons they do not have to disclose.
   Paisley resigned his Pentagon post in 1987 and became a
consultant to major defense contractors. Federal law enforcement
officials now are investigating allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former members of the
military, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that
could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   ``It is important to the confirmation process ... that we
determine just what the FBI and the White House knew about Mr.
Paisley at the time of his Senate confirmation and the extent to
which that information was made available to the Senate,'' Levin
said.
   Blacklow said Levin intended his threat to apply to all
executive nominations sent to the Senate and believed other members
would support withholding action on confirmations until the report
was released.
   ``There is no reasonable justification for either the FBI or the
White House to withhold from the members, or at least the
leadership, of the ... Senate Armed Services Committee information
about ... Paisley that should have been available during his
confirmation,'' Levin said.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marines hit 26 miles of beaches this
week, not to fight an enemy but to collect trash: bags and bags of
medical and other waste dumped by Navy vessels and washed ashore.
   At the Atlantic Beach fire station, 25 giant trash bags were
emptied into steel and plastic containers. All 25 bags had been
filled since Sunday, including two filled Wednesday.
   Much of the medical debris, such as syringes and vials that may
contain blood, were taken by state officials for testing, said Dr.
Ron Levine, state health director. Charges may be filed if
regulations have been broken, he said.
   Levine said he was relieved to find that the mess appeared to be
limited.
   ``Today, they found virtually no medical refuse of any sort,''
he said. A second search involving 40 Marines in four-wheel-drive
vehicles started in heavy rain at low tide Wednesday afternoon.
   Levine said he was pleased with the military's response. ``They
have conceded their responsibilities,'' he said. ``They will clean
up the entire situation, no matter how long it takes, and dispose
of the waste properly.''
   It is not clear if North Carolina statutes outlaw such dumping,
Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan said at a news conference in Raleigh. He has
requested an opinion from the state attorney general on the law
covering such situations, proposing a law to prohibit dumping of
waste into the ocean if the attorney general rules it is not
covered by current law.
   Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, a Navy spokesman, said most of the debris
that washed up on the beaches is ``typical trash.'' Some had come
from the USS Newport and the USS Nassau, both based in Norfolk,
Va., he said.
   Navy regulations allow dumping of biodegradable garbage within
12 miles of shore, Lloyd said. Other trash may be dumped 25 miles
or more from shore, but medical refuse that may be contaminated or
connected with dangerous drugs is held for incineration in port, he
said.
   ``It's not a contamination problem and I can say it's definitely
not related to the beach problems in New York and New Jersey,''
Lloyd said.
   Levine said the main danger posed by the refuse is the chance
that someone might be cut by a piece of glass or broken syringe.
``And that chance is very, very low, considering the amount of
stuff they found,'' he said.
   Navy officials are checking the logs of the two ships to
determine how much waste might have been dumped, Lloyd said. He
said it was uncertain whether any regulations had been violated or
what penalty such a violation might incur.
   Marines were expected to remain on the beaches through Friday.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Bill To Fight Radon Pollution in Schools,
Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee on Wednesday approved a $46
million package calling for federal and state action to combat
cancer-causing radon pollution in houses and schools.
   The legislation, which cleared the Energy and Commerce Committee
for floor action by a voice vote, would set a national long-term
goal of making the air inside buildings as free of radon gas
concentrations as the air outside buildings.
   It would require the Environmental Protection Agency to update
and revise its ``Citizen's Guide to Radon'' to include information
about health risks posed by various indoor levels of the naturally
occuring gas.
   Currently, EPA sets 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as
the level at which a homeowner should take steps to reduce levels
of radon, which is an odorless, radioactive gas produced by the
decay of uranium deposits.
   Health experts have warned, however, that this so-called action
level is too high because living in a house with a 4 picocurie
reading is believed to be the equivalent of smoking half a pack of
cigarettes a day.
   EPA has estimated that radon may be present in dangerous
concentrations in one of every eight single-family homes and that
it may be responsible for up to 20,000 lung cancer deaths annually.
   The legislation would mandate EPA to develop model construction
standards and techniques for controlling radon levels in new
buildings and to rate the values of various radon measuring devices
and radon-abatement contractors.
   The bill would provide federal money to states to survey radon
levels, run public information programs and control radon in
existing and new structures.
   EPA would be authorized to spend $1.5 million to study the
extent of radon problems in schools, propose ways to rid schools of
radon contamination and carry out remedial work at test schools in
high-risk areas.
   The bill is similar to legislation passed by the Senate in July
1987.

<DATELINE>NICOLET NATIONAL FOREST, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists who dug
quietly in national forests for about 20 years worked in front of
campers this week in what officials said is a trend toward public
involvement.
   A team of seven archaeologists scraped dirt Wednesday in about
half a dozen carefully marked, shallow pits in the pine-covered
knolls of Boulder Lake campground in this northeastern Wisconsin
forest.
   The site about 60 miles northwest of Green Bay is believed to
have been a seasonal Indian settlement about 1,000 years ago.
   It was neither large nor rare from an archaeological standpoint,
said Mark Bruhy, archaeologist for the Nicolet and Chequamegon
National forests in Wisconsin. But its location provided an
opportunity to teach people about work that is normally done
quietly in remote areas, he said.
   ``To me, there's a little irony that a favorite prehistoric
campsite has become one of our biggest campgrounds today,'' said
Michael Beckes, regional archaeologist for the U.S. Forest
Service's eastern district.
   ``In the past, we've been concerned about the security of the
sites ... but we've come to the conclusion that this is public
archaeology,'' he said.
   The Forest Service has normally kept its archaeological
locations confidential to prevent digging by amateur treasure
hunters, which on federal land is a felony, Beckes said.
   But the Forest Service began experimenting with opening sites to
the public a few years ago, he said.
   In the eastern region, which includes 14 forests in 22 states
from Minnesota to New England, three excavations were open to the
public this summer, Beckes said.
   ``It's a national trend toward greater public involvement and
public awareness,'' he said.
   About 100 people have come each day this week to Nicolet to
watch the work at plots about 3-feet-by-5-feet and less than 5
inches deep and talk to the archaeologists.
   ``It's an opportunity to see something in action that you don't
normally see,'' said Steve Straavaldsen of Madison, who watched the
work with his wife and two children. ``You see the finished product
in (museum) display cases, but you don't normally see this.''
   For the archaeologists, it was an opportunity to recruit
volunteers.
   ``I've had 50 people who have come out here and asked if they
could help,'' Bruhy said.
   Since the 1960s, the Forest Service has had archaeologists to
identify, study and help preserve sites that might have historic
value, Beckes said.
   That, however, was about 30 years late for the Boulder Lake
site, which was inadvertently damaged when the 99-site campground
area was developed in the 1930s, Bruhy said. Grading work disturbed
the ground and placement of centuries-old bone and pottery
fragments as did years of erecting tents and building fire rings,
he said.
   Bruhy found bandages and bottletops mixed in with the small
chert and quartz arrowheads, pottery shards and burned bone refuse
left by American Indians living in the area around the year 800.

<HEAD>Jackson Urges Bush, Dukakis to Drop Focus On Sleaze, One-Liners</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 5th graf bgng: Jackson, who ... to add that comments are
Jackson's first public criticism of Dukakis since Atlanta
convention.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson urged George Bush and Michael
Dukakis on Wednesday to drop their focus on one-liners and sleaze
charges and campaign for president on issues, ``not on dirt.''
   ``If it gets warped into sleaze,'' Jackson, the former
presidential candidate, told reporters, ``then there will be no
hope left for the people.... This campaign ought to focus on
direction and not on dirt ... on the live choices the people must
vote on in November.
   ``This campaign boils down to Bush attacking Dukakis with
one-liners every day, and Dukakis is becoming preoccupied with the
Bush-Noriega connection, the Bush-Iran-Contra connection, of
exchanging drugs for arms,'' Jackson said.
   ``I hope the campaign will stay at the level of what can be done
to begin to build affordable housing ... to fight a serious war on
drugs ... to enforce laws at the Justice Department to protect
people's vital interests,'' he said after a breakfast meeting with
Democratic members of the House.
   Jackson, who battled Dukakis all the way to the Democratic
convention, said the ticket of Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas is in the best interest of the country. But Jackson offered
his first public criticism of Dukakis since the two men reconciled
in Atlanta last month.
   He defended Dukakis' civil rights record even while suggesting
the Democratic nominee should have made more of a statement about
the struggle for racial equality during an appearance last month in
Philadelphia, Miss. It was near there that three young civil-rights
campaigners were murdered during the 1960s.
   Speaking in Philadelphia, Dukakis made only passing mention of
civil rights.
   ``His staff should afford even more emphasis to Philadelphia,
Miss., because of what it means to people,'' Jackson told a
questioner. ``After all, 25 years ago the great problem was around
the search'' for the three young people.
   ``Dukakis had met a number of black and white leaders even
before he made the address,'' Jackson recalled. ``It would have
been an opportune time to have spoken about'' the three youths.
``It would have been a profound message to the blacks and Jews, and
maybe even a wreath should have been laid.''
   That said, Jackson added, ``you must look at Dukakis in my
judgment in the cumulative. In the cumulative, his commitment to
social justice, his commitment to fairness is well-established....
His commitment to civil rights has been expressed rather clearly.''
   Jackson criticized as ``a rather token gesture'' President
Reagan's selection Tuesday of Lauro F. Cavazos, president of Texas
Tech University, to be secretary of education.
   Reagan was trying to send a signal to the Hispanic community on
the selection of one of their own, Jackson said. ``But after eight
years, the fact that he did not (earlier) find a Hispanic person to
be a Cabinet officer is a sure measure of their regard for that
segment of our population,'' he added.
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas hosted the breakfast for
Jackson.
   ``We had a very interesting discussion this morning,'' Wright
said. ``All our members were thrilled and strongly motivated'' by
Jackson, whom the speaker called ``one of the great thinkers of our
party, not afraid to say what needs to be said.''
   Wright said members and Jackson talked about legislation calling
for expedited voter registration, sanctions against South Africa
and underlying problems in the economy.
   Wright said the issue of aid to rebels in Nicaragua, a question
that divides Dukakis and Bentsen, was mentioned only peripherally.
   Jackson, talking to reporters, reiterated his position against
the Contras.
   ``The Contras have no base in Central America,'' he said.
``Let's pursue now a course of peace that will end the war.''

<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs with Senate resolution after 3rd graf, ``She

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has temporarily shut down
its embassy in Burma following anti-government demonstrations that
appear to have led to a ``substantial'' loss of life, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   All official American personnel and their dependents _ a total
of 154 people _ are safe at their homes, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said.
   She said the United States deplores the shooting of unarmed
demonstrators by Burmese security forces and she expressed concern
about reports that troops were seeking out groups of protesters and
firing on them.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., introduced a resolution condemning the killings and mass
arrests by the Burmese army and supporting an end to one-party rule
in Burma.
   The measure, which will probably be voted on by the Senate later
this week, also urges President Reagan to raise the question of
human rights abuses with Burmese authorities.
   Mrs. Oakley was unable to say when the Rangoon embassy was
closed, but she said there is no indication that Americans or other
foreigners have been or might become targets of violence.
   Widespread anti-government demonstrations erupted last month
after the appointment as president of a military commander who had
been accused by students and others of ruthless suppression of
dissent.
   Mrs. Oakley said an official U.S. notice urging Americans to
exercise caution in Burma remains in effect. It calls on Americans
traveling to that Asian country to seek information from the State
Department or U.S. diplomatic posts to inquire about current
conditions there. There are normally about 80 American visitors to
Burma at any given time.
   The spokeswoman said the ``casualty numbers appear
substantial,'' citing Burmese government reports of 33 dead and 59
wounded. Some of the casualties apparently were members of the army
and security forces.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Oakley said, a U.S. Embassy officer driving to
work became trapped in a demonstration. After a bullet struck his
car, demonstrators loaded wounded protesters into the vehicle and
the officer was forced to drive them to a safe location. He left
the scene unharmed, she said.

   Honduras said Wednesday that 26
Nicaraguan soldiers and 115 relatives crossed the border seeking
political asylum, but a Nicaraguan military source said Contra
rebels probably had kidnapped civilians.
   A statement by the armed forces public relations office said the
Nicaraguan soldiers, including officers, entered Honduras on Sunday
in the Pranza area of isolated Gracias a Dios province along the
Segovia River.
   ``A total of 26 deserters from Nicaragua's Popular Sandinista
Army ... and 115 members of their families, including women,
adolescents and small children entered national territory,'' the
statement said.
   It said the group came from northeastern Nicaragua but gave no
details or identities. According to the statement, the soldiers
brought all their combat gear, including Soviet-made AK-47 rifles,
a machine gun, anti-tank weapons, ammunition, rocket-propelled
grenades, flares and other military supplies.
   The Nicaraguan men and their families had gone to Nicaragua in
May under a repatriation and amnesty plan after living in Honduras
as refugees from Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, it said.
   Members of the group were quoted as saying the soldiers decided
to desert because they were inducted into the Sandinista army and
assigned to patrol the Honduran border.
   People who returned were told they would not be prosecuted or
investigated for connections with the Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras, if they promised to shun anti-government activity.
   Some deserters were quoted as saying they were mistreated and
forced to carry out ``harassment patrols'' along the border. No
details were given.
   Sources at the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry in Managua denied the
report.
   One called it ``totally false'' and added: ``What's more like it
is a kidnapping of an undetermined number of civilians by the
Contras in coordination with the Honduran army.''
   ``We have reports that forces of the 5th Infantry Battalion of
the Honduran army brought in vehicles on the morning of Aug. 8 to
carry away the kidnapped,'' the source said.

   An Iraqi pilot said he walked for six days
through enemy territory to reach his homeland after being shot down
in Iran and wounded.
   Kassem Hassan Hamid Dulayni, an air force captain, said he
escaped capture twice on the 25-mile trek through rugged Iranian
countryside. He spoke to Iraqi reporters and his account was
carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
   Dulayni said he was ejected when his jet was hit, but did not
give the date or location.
   ``When I landed on the ground ... I didn't get caught, so I
decided to do the impossible and return to the homeland,'' he said.
The agency report said he suffered arm, leg and neck injuries.
   ``It was God who gave me patience and faith,'' Dulayni said, and
``it was a very good omen for me that I was accompanied on my
journey by a very strange bird, a bird with black and white
feathers.''
   The captain said he walked three miles the first day and climbed
a peak, from which he scanned the surrounding land, and found a
cave in which to sleep.
   In the morning, he set out with a compass toward the Himreen
Mountains on the border.
   ``I was really very thirsty, so I was forced to drink my own
urine, although I knew it was dangerous,'' he said. ``But it was
hot and I couldn't avoid it.''
   He felt feverish for much of the journey and dug holes in the
ground to cool off and sleep, Dulayni said.
   His green uniform blended with the grassy terrain, he said, and
he escaped detection by an Iranian patrol and a tank.
   ``The most difficult part was when I had to cross a small bridge
on a river near the border,'' he told the reporters.
   Dulayni waved a white flag at Iraqi border troops, who first
thought he was an Iranian but then realized he was an Iraqi and
``carried me on their shoulders.''

<TEXT>
   Richard Murphy, special U.S. envoy to the
Middle East, met with President Hosni Mubarak at the end of his
current tour Wednesday but there was no sign of progress in
reviving Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
   Before coming to Cairo on Tuesday, Murphy visited Lebanon,
Syria, Israel and Jordan to evaluate prospects for peace talks. He
leaves for home Thursday.
   The Murphy-Mubarak meeting took place the day after Murphy, an
assistant secretary of state, announced that Egypt had been unable
to arrange meeting for him in Cairo with Palestinian
representatives.
   Murphy gave no reason, but a well-connected Palestinian source
said the Americans objected to two of six proposed Palestinian
participants, apparently because they were closely linked to the
Palestine Liberation Organization. The source spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Mubarak received Murphy at the presidential residence, where the
media is barred. Murphy said later their talks covered regional
topics and the ``major issues (of) the coming months.''
   Murphy also met with Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and
Osama Baz, Mubarak's chief political adviser.
   ``I am now in a much better position going back and presenting
my report to President Reagan's Secretary (of State George P.)
Shultz,'' Murphy told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with
Baz on Wednesday.
   Baz said: ``We (the Egyptians) stressed the need to continue
moving in an attempt to hold the international conference next
spring, with a U.S. role in issues still in conflict such as
Palestinian representation, the preparations for the conference and
its legal basis.''
   His statement was the first reference to an attempt at
scheduling the conference for next spring.
   A peace plan presented by Shultz this year initially aimed for
an international conference last May, including all the parties
concerned under the auspices of the U.N. Security Council's five
permanent members: The United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain
and France.
   Shultz's plan remains on the table but there has been no
movement. The plan won qualified Egyptian support but Israel,
Jordan, Syria and the Palestinians balked.
   In a chat with reporters Tuesday, Mubarak refused to concur with
a questioner's suggestion that the Shultz plan was dead because of
last week's decision by King Hussein of Jordan to sever
administrative and legal links with the Israeli-occupied West Bank,
where about 850,000 Palestinians live.
   Mubarak said Hussein remains committed to the Middle East peace
process, a view Murphy also expressed before leaving Jordan for
Egypt.

   Composer Giacinto Scelsi, known for avant-garde
choral and symphonic music, died of a stroke, officials at Gemelli
Hospital said Wednesday. He was 83.
   Hospital officials said he died Tuesday.
   Scelsi studied dodecaphonic music in Vienna and later moved to
France, where he spent much of his career. Dodecaphonic
compositions are built on 12-tone scale that includes half-tones
absent from traditional eight-note scales. Scelsi was known in
Europe for using spiritual themes and for Eastern influence in his
work.

   The skipper of the USS Dubuque is about to be
relieved from command pending an investigation into whether his
vessel failed to render sufficient aid to a boatload of Vietnamese
refugees who reportedly survived through cannibalism, defense
sources said Wednesday.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Capt. Alex G.
Balian would be replaced at least temporarily as the commander of
the Dubuque, an amphibious landing ship now on duty in the Persian
Gulf.
   The sources said another Navy officer was en route to the
Persian Gulf to relieve Balian, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran.
   The sources indicated Wednesday that Balian was not being
relieved ``for cause'' in a disciplinary move, but rather being
replaced temporarily ``on an administrative basis'' pending
completion of an investigation.
   ``But they are going to relieve him,'' said one official. ``The
question is obviously should he have rendered more assistance? The
allegations raise serious questions.''
   The Navy and the United Nations High Commission on Refugees are
both investigating reports of murder and cannibalism that surfaced
earlier this week in a Filipino newspaper. The Vietnamese boat
people eventually were rescued off the Philippines and are now in a
refugee camp there.
   The newspaper quoted survivors among the Vietnamese as saying
they killed and ate the flesh of some of their fellow passengers to
stay alive. Two of the victims reportedly died of starvation, but
the other three were allegedly murdered through drowning and then
eaten.
   The Navy's investigation stems from the fact that some of the
survivors maintain the Dubuque refused to take them aboard, instead
providing some food and water and then leaving them because it was
on a ``dangerous mission.''
   Under Navy regulations, U.S. warships are expected ``to extend
humanitarian assistance as needed'' in such circumstances.
   ``In the case of an unseaworthy vessel, adverse weather or other
special circumstances, the refugees may be embarked and transported
to the Navy ship's next port of call,'' the regulations state.
   According to Robert Cooper, local representative of the U.N.
High Commission on Refugees in Manila, 52 refugees survived 37 days
at sea and are now charging the Dubuque refused to take them aboard
even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure
and starvation.
   Cooper said the refugees reported that 58 people died during the
South China Sea crossing, which began May 22 when the group left
the Mekong Delta town of Ben Tre aboard a 35-foot wooden boat.
   Its engine failed two or three days later.
   According to the Navy, the Dubuque _ on its way to the Persian
Gulf _ encountered the Vietnamese vessel on June 9.
   ``The craft was judged to be in seaworthy condition and was
under sail ...,'' the Navy said in a statement issued Tuesday.
   ``The USS Dubuque gave the refugees food, water and navigational
charts before resuming transit to the Indian Ocean.''
   Cooper said the refugees are claiming that by June 9, ``there
was one dead refugee aboard, the motor was not working, they were
drifting for 19 days, people had died of exposure, hunger and
thirst.''
   The refugees claimed to have later killed some of their
companions and eaten their flesh to survive. Cooper said the
``great majority'' of other deaths also occurred after the
encounter with the Dubuque.
   Cooper said Tuesday that if the allegations proved true, it
would be the first time the U.S. Navy had failed to adequately help
a group of boat people since they began fleeing after the fall of
South Vietnam to the communists in 1975.
   The Navy and the Defense Department declined comment Wednesday
on Capt. Balian's status.
   Balian, 48, is a native of the Los Angeles area who won a Silver
Star for heroism in Vietnam in 1966 while a young lieutenant.
   His Navy patrol boat was sunk in a Viet Cong night ambush on a
river near Vung Tau, southeast of Saigon. One crewman was killed
and Balian and other crewmen were wounded, but managed to escape to
safety aboard a makeshift raft.
   In a related development, the Navy said Wednesday another of its
warships, the frigate Badger, had rescued 41 Vietnamese boat people
in the South China Sea to the west of the Philippines on Tuesday
night. The refugees' ship apparently became grounded, the Navy said.

<TEXT>
   An Angolan jet mistook the Botswana
presidential plane for an enemy aircraft and shot it down, injuring
President Quett Masire, his office said Wednesday.
   It said Masire suffered cuts on his back and his protocol
officer was also injured when the executive aircraft was attacked
on Sunday while flying over Kuito Bie in Angola, bound for a summit
in the Angolan capital of Luanda.
   The pilot managed to land the plane, and Masire was treated at a
hospital in Luanda, while other leaders of front-line states met to
discuss proposals for ending the Angolan war.
   Masire's office said Angola and Botswana were still
investigating to find out exactly what happened, but it was
established that the president's plane was ``mistaken as an enemy
aircraft ... and shot down by an Angolan jet fighter.''
   The front-line states are a group of black African states that
border on South Africa or are particularly concerned with events
there. They often meet to discuss policy toward the Pretoria
government. The nations are Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique,
Tanzania and Angola.

   Wage demands apparently won't stop the music
at the Republican National Convention.
   Entertainment before each session of a national political
convention traditionally is provided free. However, the Musicians
Mutual Protective Union, Local 174-496, ruled last month that its
members could not play unless paid union scale.
   Convention officials said Tuesday that local bands are now
expected to play at two sessions in the Louisiana Superdome, and
either non-union or outside bands at the other four.
   New Orleans bandleader Jimmy Maxwell said he will personally pay
the members of his orchestra so it can perform the first night.
   He said he was motivated both by ``a sense of civic spirit and
desire to help the city look good.''
   The other union band expected to appear is the New Leviathan
Oriental Fox-Trot Orchestra. Spokesman John Kraft said he expects a
corporate sponsor to pay the salaries so the band can play before
the final session.
   The band that performs during the convention sessions is paid.
It will be led by Manny Harmon, a California bandleader.

returned Wednesday from a second series of chemotherapy treatments
for terminal liver cancer in the United States, a government source
said.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Duarte
arrived at Ilopango air base after spending nine days at Walter
Reed army hospital in Washington.
   Doctors at Walter Reed removed part of Duarte's stomach in June,
when he received chemotherapy for the first time. His Salvadoran
doctors say he is expected to live only six to 18 months.
   Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount has been acting chief
executive of this small Central American nation, where a civil war
between U.S.-supported governments and leftist rebels began nearly
nine years ago. Human rights groups say more than 65,000 people
have been killed, most of them civilians.

<HEAD>Aspin Says Faulty B1-B Bomber System May Not Be Worth Fixing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The B-1B bomber has such serious problems that
the Pentagon should consider halting spending on the new long-range
plane and using the money for other nuclear weapons, a key
congressman said Wednesday.
   ``Is it really worth it to spend any more money on the B-1B?''
said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee and one of the leading critics of the plane that
President Reagan resurrected in 1981.
   ``We have a very serious problem on our hands,'' Aspin said.
``If a case cannot be made for the B-1B, I do not see how we can
spend any more money on it.''
   Aspin's questions and criticisms were posed in a letter to
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and a speech Aspin planned to
deliver on the House floor Thursday.
   The Air Force continued to defend the long-range bomber,
although it admitted in a statement that it has been unable to fix
the problems with the B-1B's electronic countermeasures equipment,
which is the computer-driven system designed to keep the bomber
from being shot down by enemy planes or missiles.
   The B-1 originally was killed in 1977 by President Carter, but
Reagan reversed that decision four years later and approved the
purchase of 100 B-1s for a total of $27.3 billion. The chief
contractor is Rockwell International, which already has built all
100 planes.
   Reagan said the plane was needed to replace the aging B-52s in
the nation's long-range bomber arsenal until the ``stealth'' bomber
becomes available. That plane, named after its intended capability
to evade enemy radar, will be rolled out publicly for the first
time in November.
   The B-1B has run into a series of highly publicized problems,
which the Air Force first said were the types of problems
associated with any new plane.
   But fixing the electronic countermeasures problem is not so
easy, the service said.
   ``Here the solutions are not so well defined and the
uncertainties were much greater,'' its statement said.
   Two months ago, the statement said, ``the Air Force determined
that work was behind schedule and the solutions being pursued would
not provide for the full ECM system maturity the Air Force
desired.''
   ``There has been progress in the ECM system and it adds
significantly to the aircraft's capability. However, that progress
has not been satisfactory and the management of the ECM system has
not met our expectations. We are currently working out the most
appropriate action in the face of those facts.''
   Aspin asked Carlucci to tell Congress how much it will cost to
improve the B-1B, whether the additional money will provide
additional capability and how the plane's mission can be changed if
the money isn't spent.
   Unless the questions are answered, ``we may well be faced with
the prospect of parking the B-1B,'' Aspin said.
   He suggested that perhaps the money which would be spent on the
B-1B could be better used for other long-range atomic weapons, such
as land-based nuclear missiles.
   From now until the year 2004, the United States will spend a
projected total of $425 billion for strategic weapons and $242
billion of that total, or 57 percent, will go for bombers, he said.
   ``We need to ask ourselves if this money would not be better
spent on systems that do not have as many uncertainties as the B-1B
program,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Passes $633 Million 1988 Supplemental Spending Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate passed legislation on Wednesday
granting $633 million to several federal programs running low on
money, a measure that was stalled for nearly a week because of an
election-year fight over aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Lawmakers approved the legislation on a voice vote without
objection. The Senate now must work out a compromise bill with the
House, which passed a different version of the measure July 27.
   The measure was touted as a ``dire emergency'' spending bill
because it is supposed to provide money for programs that are in
danger of running out of funds, including programs in the
departments of Justice and Agriculture, the Coast Guard and the
Veterans Administration.
   Supplemental spending bills such as this one often become grab
bags for lawmakers eager to provide pet projects for their
constituents. But last fall's budget summit pact between President
Reagan and congressional leaders specified that the bill should be
limited to emergency spending.
   Most floor action on the bill was completed last Thursday.
   Final passage was delayed as Democrats and Republicans spent
days fruitlessly trying to work out a plan to aid the Contras.
   Just before final passage of the spending bill, the Senate
rejected a GOP amendment, 57-39, that could have provided the
Contras with $20 million in military aid beyond what the Democrats
prefer.
   The delay frustrated Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., who complained to reporters that administration
intransigence on the Contra aid package threw a roadblock in front
of the spending legislation.
   ``They shouldn't hold the supplemental hostage to Contra aid,''
Byrd said.
   The bill, which also allows the transfer of nearly $200 million
among the budgets of several government agencies, is for the 1988
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   It contains $530 million in new spending and transfers for the
Veterans Administration, which needs the money for increased
benefits and for a higher than expected caseload.
   The bill initially contained $297 million for veterans, but
lawmakers added $233 million more on a voice vote after Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee,
argued that the extra spending was required by law.
   The legislation also would provide $75 million for the
Department of Justice, mostly to pay for the costs of last year's
uprisings by Cuban detainees in federal prisons in Atlanta and
Oakdale, La.; $60 million for the Coast Guard to cover the costs of
patrols; and $55 million to help the Agriculture Department pay for
drought programs.
   Programs paying benefits to people who lose their jobs because
of imports would get $49 million; the government's black lung
disease program would receive $43 million; and the FBI would get
$23 million to help its agents observe Soviet inspectors monitoring
American compliance with the new nuclear weapons treaty.
   The House bill contained only $189 million in new spending and
included no funds for veterans. It also has money for state
unemployment offices and for the costs of processing refugees from
the Soviet Union and other countries who want to come to the United
States. The Senate deleted those provisions.

   Scores of demonstrators have been
killed during two days of anti-government protests in Burma and
rioters beheaded three policemen Wednesday in Rangoon, the official
Burmese radio reported.
   It said 30 people were killed in Rangoon street battles
Wednesday, bringing the officially reported death toll for the two
days throughout the country to about 80. A mob attacked a police
station in southern Burma, the radio added.
   Unofficial reports said the death count may be well over 100
from clashes between security forces and generally unarmed
students, Buddhist monks and others demanding the ouster of
President Sein Lwin and a return to democracy.
   Rangoon radio has reported about 160 wounded and 1,500 arrested
in the two days. The capital has been under martial law for a week,
a curfew was imposed Tuesday and gatherings of more than five
people are prohibited.
   The demonstrations are by far the largest since a coup by Ne Win
ended democracy in Burma in 1962. Sein Lwin became president and
head of the government party last month when Ne Win resigned after
26 years in power.
   Protesters accuse Sein Lwin of ruthlessly suppressing student
riots in March and June, when he was an army general, and earlier
harsh measures against dissenters.
   Diplomats and travelers arriving from Rangoon said Wednesday the
government was had stopped issuing tourist visas and was moving to
seal off the country. Foreign journalists have been kept out since
trouble began after the transfer of power.
   The State Department said the U.S. Embassy had been closed
temporarily. All official American personnel and their dependents _
154 people _ are safe at their homes, said State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley in Washington.
   Five U.S. senators introduced a resolution condemning the
shooting of unarmed demonstrators. It asks that one-party rule end
and urges President Reagan to raise the issue of human rights
abuses with Burmese authorities.
   State Department officials said an American diplomat's car was
trapped in a demonstration Tuesday and hit by a bullet, then
protesters loaded it with wounded comrades and forced him to drive
them to safety. A British diplomat was hit with a rifle butt and
detained for for hours, a State Department official said.
   The Foreign Office in Britain, the former colonial power, warned
citizens not to travel to Burma.
   Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, said security forces opened
fire on 15 occasions to disperse crowds in the capital. It said
incomplete reports listed 33 people dead, 59 wounded and 113 were
arrested for ``violence and looting.''
   It said three policemen were beheaded and another member of the
security forces and a civilian killed in outlying areas of the
capital. Whether they were included in the 33 deaths reported in
Rangoon was not clear.
   Demonstrators in Moulmein, on the southern coast, seized guns
from police who fired to disperse them, marched to the station and
shot a policeman dead, the radio said.
   Rioters set fire to buses, police stations and government family
quarters, destroyed rail lines and burned down buildings in Rangoon
and its environs, the official account said.
   Japan's Kyodo News Agency said more than 100 people were killed
and nearly 1,000 wounded Wednesday in Rangoon, quoting an
unidentified, informed source reached in the Burmese capital. It
said soldiers used automatic rifles and machine guns to disperse
demonstrators.
   Diplomats in Rangoon and Bangkok said they believe casualties
may have been 100-200 on Tuesday, with more dead and wounded
Wednesday, but added that the confusion in Rangoon makes access to
reliable information difficult.
   Some travelers said were interrogated and detained in Rangoon,
and others were expelled before their seven-day visas expired.
``They're flushing everyone from the country,'' a British tourist
said.
   Alain Ervard, a news photographer based in Hong Kong, said he
and nine Spanish tourists were detained overnight at the
immigration office in Rangoon. He said they were interrogated,
their passports seized temporarily and their film confiscated.
   Ervard said soldiers chased him after he took pictures of tanks
and vehicles with mounted machine guns, which formed a barrier to
keep huge crowds of protestors from converging. ``The military got
ready to shoot (me), and they told me to stop,'' he said.
   The Spanish tourists said soldiers stopped them Tuesday on the
road to Rangoon and took them into the capital.
   Four Italian tourists left Burma after only a day. They were
told all planes and trains from Rangoon to other parts of the
country had been canceled and they could not travel by road to the
ancient temples of Pagan in central Burma because of protests there.

   A Nile tourist boat carrying 100 people sank
in a storm Wednesday and 34 people were missing and feared dead,
the state-run Middle East News Agency said. A police official also
reported one person known dead.
   Rescue teams were searching for 17 missing Italian tourists and
17 Egyptian crew members, MENA said.
   An Aswan police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the body of an Egyptian crew member was recovered.
   ``An extremely violent storm hit suddenly, and in 30 seconds the
huge ship had gone to the bottom,'' tour director Paolo Fissora
told the Italian news agency ANSA in a telephone interview. ``I
don't remember it all too well. In just a few minutes I found
myself in the water.''
   The ship, The Nubia, was sailing 150 miles northward from Aswan
to Luxor. It capsized and sank in strong winds near Edfu, about 500
miles south of Cairo, the reports said.
   MENA said 34 Italian tourists and 27 Egyptian crew were saved.
   In Rome, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said 50 Italians were on
board and 17 were missing.
   ``Until the morning, when the light comes, we won't know
anything (about the missing),'' said the spokeswoman, who refused
to give her name.
   She said 33 Italians were rescued and were recovering in local
hospitals from minor injuries and shock.
   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in
figures from the different accounts.
   Late Wednesday, ANSA quoted Fissora as saying the rescued
Italians had been released from the hospitals.
   Best Tours of Milan, which organized the trip, reserved a plane
to fly the survivors home, ANSA said.
   Many Nile River towns in southern Egypt are tourist sites, rich
with ancient monuments and remains, and ships regularly cruise
along the waterway.

<HEAD>Bill To Impose Tighter Rules on Medical Labs Goes to Full Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel on Wednesday approved
legislation designed to tighten standards for medical laboratory
testing, including pap smear tests to detect cervical cancer in
women.
   The measure, approved by the Labor and Human Resources Committee
on a voice vote, would require annual inspection and licensing of
all laboratories which perform clinical lab testing, including
those in physicians' offices.
   Similar legislation passed the House Energy and Commerce
Committee on Tuesday. Senate and House floor action is expected in
the fall, following the congressional recesses.
   The bill also would:
   _Establish a means for testing the proficiency of individual lab
technicans and judging the overall performance of laboratories.
Labs also will be required to limit the workload _ tests performed
per day _ for employees reading pap smears.
   _Require laboratories to bill patients directly for tests
performed, rather than through the physicians, to ensure that
doctors choose laboratories based on quality and not cost.
   _Establish tougher, uniform quality assurance standards for all
lab testing.
   The regulations would be enforced by the Health and Human
Services Department.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who along with Sen. Brock Adams,
D-Wash., was a chief sponsor, said after the committee acted:
``There are too many labs out there where overworked,
undersupervised technicians are making too many errors _ errors
that mean the difference between life and death. We cannot allow
this practice to continue.''
   Mikulski and Adams held a hearing in January in which testimony
was given that as many as 20 percent to 40 percent of pap smear
test results are inaccurate, resulting in undiagnosed cases of
cervical cancer.
   The testimony indicated that the cause of the inaccuracies was
unregulated medical labs and ``pap mills'' _ huge labs which
process thousands of tests a day with virtually no quality
assurance standards.
   ``Now, when someone uses a lab, whether it's for a pap smear, a
cholesterol test or a pregnancy test, they will know that the
results will be accurate and reliable,'' Ms. Mikulski said.

<TEXT>
   Residents threw stones at a group of
Hindu untouchables after they entered a temple on Wednesday and
police rushed in to restore order, a news agency said. Eight people
were reported injured.
   The violence followed weeks of religious and social controversy
over whether untouchables, traditionally considered the lowest
class among Hindus, should be allowed into the temple.
   Federal Welfare Minister Rajendra Kumari Bajpai told Parliament
Wednesday that the Rajasthan state government had been instructed
to make sure all people, including untouchables, or Harijans, were
allowed into the shrine.
   ``Our object was that the Harijans should enter the temple, and
that has happened,'' Mrs. Bajpai said.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said residents attacked the
untouchables with stones at Nathdwara, in Rajasthan, about 330
miles southwest of New Delhi. It did provide details of the
violence.
   Last month, a group of untouchables tried to march to the
18th-century temple to protest a Hindu priest's reported comment
that untouchables should not be allowed to enter the faith's
shrines.
   Police arrested dozens of marchers at the time, apparently to
prevent a clash between them and about 5,000 upper-caste Hindus
guarding the temple.
   The move, described as an attempt to keep untouchables out of
the temple, drew sharp criticism.
   The priest, Sankaracharya Niranjandev Tirth, was quoted by
Indian newspapers as saying that untouchables have ``no religious
fitness to go to a temple.'' Tirth is regarded as a living saint by
many Hindus.
   The untouchables had not been allowed in the shrine in past
years.
   The Harijans were traditionally looked down upon and their touch
was regarded as defiling. Such practices persist today in many
places, especially in rural areas, although discrimination against
untouchables was outlawed in 1950 under India's constitution.
   Hindus make up 80 percent of India's 800 million people. They
are mainly divided into four major castes. Below the castes are the
Harijans, a group without caste.
   Harijan, which means ``Children of God'' in the Hindi language,
was given to the community by the hero of India's independence
movement, Mohandas K. Gandhi.

   Twenty women chained themselves to a
fence Wednesday at the shuttered building where Congress used to
meet to protest the government of President Augusto Pinochet.
Twelve protesters were reported arrested.
   Police used water cannons to disperse about 50 youths who
blocked traffic and chanted slogans in support of the women,
witnesses said.
   The women, who identified themselves as relatives of political
prisoners, wrapped a long chain around their waists and padlocked
it to the Congress building in downtown Santiago. They held up
signs reading ``Open Chile's Jails. Freedom for Political
Prisoners.''
   Police arrived about five minutes later and used bolt cutters to
snap the chain. They took 12 women into custody, according to
lawyers for the Association of Political Prisoners' Relatives.
   No immediate word came on what charges the women faced but the
lawyers said the courts were asked to clarify their status.
   Congress was suspended when Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup.
According to human rights groups, more than 400 opponents of his
authoritarian government now are jailed. Most were accused of being
involved in leftist guerrilla activity.

<HEAD>Police Say Polish Dancer Defected For Love</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Polish dancer who performed at an Israeli
folk festival defected hours before he was to leave the country,
apparently because he fell in love with an Israeli woman,
authorities said Wednesday.
   Police said they were searching for the Pole, who defected
Tuesday and was identified as Sigmund Irinauch, in his late 20s.
   Officials would not reveal the woman's name, but said she is a
Jerusalem folk dancer who met Irinauch when their troupes performed
in Canada two years ago.
   Yossi Gavrieli, who is director of the woman's troupe and knows
Irinauch, said the Polish dancer is Jewish.
   If that is true, he qualifies for automatic citizenship and need
not request political asylum. Israel's Law of Return grants
automatic citizenship to all Jews who want to live in Israel.
   ``It is very sensitive, so I don't want to say anything more,''
said Gavrieli, whose Hora Jerusalem group appeared with Irinauch's
Slovianki dance troupe in Canada. ``He is Jewish, but he has not
yet received asylum. Everyone is very concerned about him.''
   A Foreign Ministry official said Irinauch had not applied for
asylum but is allowed to remain in Israel until his visa expires.
   Dancers in the 46-member Polish troupe, which performed at the
festival in Haifa, searched for Irinauch on the Technion University
campus where they were housed, then left for home Tuesday via
Romania, the newspaper Yediot Ahronot reported.
   It said Irinauch left his roommates a letter saying: ``I didn't
want to tell you about it so I would not get you in trouble. I will
write to you from Israel. Give my warmest regards to all the
troupe.''
   Slovianki was in Israel for two weeks, one of three Eastern
European folk groups performing at the festival.
   Gavrieli described Irinauch as a star of the Polish troupe.
   ``He is a super professional, a maddening dancer,'' Gavrieli
said. ``He is also a very nice guy, unusually so, warm and lively.''
   A Polish-born dance teacher who acted a tour guide for the
Warsaw group said Irinauch appeared to know a lot about Israel but
gave no indication he was about to defect.
   ``When the group visited the Sea of Galilee, he could point out
the sites better than I,'' Tamar Goldner said. ``He knew every
place. He surprised the Israeli guides with his knowledge.''
   She added, however: ``He was the last person I thought would
defect. He was quiet and did not stand out in any way.''

<HEAD>Government Employee Union Cites Spending Cuts During Reagan Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House and Congress have cut domestic
government programs by a total of $158.6 billion in terms of the
services delivered since President Reagan assumed office, according
to a report commissioned by a union of government workers.
   Federal aid to state and local governments over the past seven
years is 16.5 percent, or $123.6 billion, below what it would have
been had programs in place in 1981 been maintained at then-current
service levels, said the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
   Cumulative government payments to individuals such as college
aid, Social Security and food stamps over the seven years are $35
billion less or 2.3 percent below what they would have totaled had
the programs been maintained at 1981 levels, the AFSCME study said.
   The 1.1-million-member union said in the report prepared for
release Thursday that the decreases on domestic speding from 1981
levels amounts to a total of $642 over the seven years for every
man, woman and child in the country.
   The biggest percentage decreases, according to the AFSCME study
_ titled ``The Republican Record: A 7-Year Analysis of State Losses
of Federal Funding'' _ was state aid to provide free or
reduced-price milk to schoolchildren.
   Federal spending on the milk program has totaled $131 million
over the past seven years, or 86.2 percent below the $950 million
that would have been spent had the program been maintained at is
1981 funding level, the report said.
   However, federal aid to state and local governments for
providing supplemental food assistance to pregnant or
breast-feeding women and children under age 5 has increased over
the past seven years by a total of 39 percent.
   Cumulatative figures show federal spending on those programs for
pregnant mothers and infants totaled $10.1 billion, or about $2.8
billion above what it would have been had the program been only
maintained at the 1981 level.
   Other programs where federal aid to state and local government
has decreased are bilingual education, vocational and adult
education, job training, health services, welfare, juvenile
delinquency counseling, subsidized housing and special programs for
the elderly.
   Programs in which the cumulative federal aid over the seven
years has exceeded 1981 funding levels include drug education, Head
Start, libraries, science and math education, elderly nutrition,
child welfare services, Food Stamp administration and highways.
   ``Taken togehter, programs aiding children and families were cut
by almost $80 billion while programs aiding the elderly were cut by
almost $49 billion,'' the union said.
   The computations for the study were done by Fiscal Planning
Services Inc., a consultant that analyzes the federal budget for
state and local government

<HEAD>Town GOP Chairman Quits After White Supremacist Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A town Republican chairman resigned
Wednesday under pressure from party leaders outraged over white
supremacist views he expressed in two newspaper articles.
   ``Because of the political pressure that's being put on me, it
would be better for the party if I resigned,'' Elmer A. Chipparoni
told The Associated Press.
   State GOP Chairman J. Michael Levesque and Gov. Edward D.
DiPrete were among Republicans calling for Chipparoni's resignation.
   ``The governor totally disagrees with his views and thinks there
is no room for them in the Republican Party,'' said DiPrete's
spokeswoman, Nanci Martin.
   Chipparoni, 68, was quoted in the Standard-Times of North
Kingstown and The Providence Journal as saying that ``white
America'' is committing ``genetic and cultural suicide'' by
allowing in too many blacks, Hispanics and Asians.
   He said that if non-whites ever became a substantial majority in
the United States, ``I wouldn't want to live here.''
   Asked if his views could be interpreted as being white
supremacist, Chipparoni replied, ``I'd hate to put it that way, but
I wouldn't disagree.''
   Chipparoni told The Associated Press in a brief telephone
interview that his views were taken out of context, but he did not
elaborate.
   He said he was giving up both his town party post and his seat
on the state party's central committee.
   A replacement will be chosen at the next meeting of the
35-member town committee, which has no black members, vice chairman
James S. Wilson said.
   In the newspaper stories, Chipparoni said U.S. immigration
policies should be changed to permit entry by fewer people from
Third World countries and more whites from Western Europe.
   ``I'm not saying white is the only way to go,'' said Chipparoni.
``But it does make a difference in the quality of a country.''
   He said that whites have a capability for achievement that ``is
in the genes.'' Chipparoni said his views are his own and not his
party's.
   ``He's not as bad as Hitler, but he'd make a good KKK member,''
said Harold F. Smith, president of the neighboring South Kingstown
Town Council.
   ``The term that upsets me most is ``white America,'' said Smith,
who is black and is the affirmative action officer at the
University of Rhode Island. ``You can't have a white American _
that's not America.''

<HEAD>German State Objects To U.S. Plans For Additional Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WIESBADEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The central state of Hesse
strongly objected on Wednesday to U.S. military plans to increase
the number of aircraft stationed at a base outside Frankfurt.
   State government spokesman Alexander Gauland told a news
conference in Wiesbaden the increase in aircraft at the U.S. base
in Erbenheim would present increased danger to civilian aircraft in
the area.
   Erbenheim is less than 12{ miles west of Frankfurt Airport, the
busiest hub on the Continent.
   West Germany's Defense Ministry will have the final say, but has
not yet decided about the increase. The U.S. military wants to
boost the number of military aircraft stationed at Erbenheim from
53 to 181 by 1993.
   Gauland said a National Air Traffic Safety office report showed
an increase in military aircraft in the area would raise the danger
of disruption to departing or arriving civilian aircraft.
   He said increased air traffic also would raise noise levels and
increase air pollution.
   Congested air space has been a topic of controversy after a
series of U.S. and other military plane crashes in West Germany in
the past four months.
   The Defense Ministry on July 29 announced plans to cut by 2,000
hours the number of NATO military flight hours in West Germany.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Controversial Child Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharply divided House panel on Wednesday
approved the $2.5 billion Act for Better Child Care Services, but
like its Senate counterpart left some fundamental controversies
unresolved as the bill headed to the floors of both chambers.
   The 19-14 vote in the Education and Labor Committee on the
so-called ABC bill, the major Democratic initiative in the
politically hot child care arena, came during the third day of work
on the measure.
   Rep. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., was the only Republican to vote in
favor of the bill. Two Democrats, Pat Williams of Montana and Tim
Penny of Minnesota, voted no.
   As approved by the panel, the bill would authorize $2.5 billion
next year to go to states, with 75 percent of it to be used to help
low- and moderate-income families pay for child care either through
vouchers or direct payments to providers.
   While most of the money would go to the working poor, states
theoretically could give some help to households earning up to 115
percent of the state's median income _ over $40,000 in some places.
   Committee Democrats beat off two attempts to lower the income
eligibility level. But they accepted an amendment lowering the age
level of eligible children from 15 to 12.
   Republicans on the panel tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the
bill's requirement for a commission to develop minimum health,
safety and training standards that would be mandatory for those day
care homes and centers accepting the federal aid.
   As introduced, the ABC bill would have allowed federal funds to
church-based day care centers only if they did not promote religion
in any way. They would have had to comply with federal bans on
religious discrimination in hiring and admissions.
   But the version passed by the committee says only day-care slots
paid for by the federal government would have to be available to
all children regardless of religion. The ban on hiring
discrimination was dropped.
   Committee Chairman Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said in a
statement after the vote Wednesday that he is still concerned about
the church-state and admissions issues.
   ``While I would prefer more precise language ensuring that
religious indoctrination will not occur, I support the current
language at this time in order to move the bill forward,'' he said.
``I want to make clear that as a general proposition, all persons
should have equal access to day care programs supported in whole or
in part by federal financial assistance.''
   The church-state issue and others debated by the committee were
discussed in subcommittee and are expected to arise again on the
House floor.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, sponsor of a rival child care bill
centered on tax credits and vouchers, contended the ABC bill
discriminates against families with a parent at home. He also
claimed it would narrow parental options and raise child care costs.
   Other Republican objections centered on the cost of the bill.
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said there is no way in a
non-election year that the appropriations committees would allocate
more than $1 billion to a new program. And Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, proposed authorizing up to $100 billion _ what he called
the true price tag for ``a fiscal time bomb'' _ rather than the
$2.5 billion called for in the bill.
   He was voted down.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee last month
approved the ABC bill after lowering the income eligibility level
to 100 percent of median income, targeting money more pointedly
toward low-income families, including states in the standards
development process and giving them two years to comply with
caregiver training requirements.
   However, before the senators voted, ABC supporters agreed to sit
down with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and try to work out compromises
on the cost of the bill and the federal standards issue. Meetings
have occurred but there have been no concrete results thus far.

   Adela Rogers St. Johns, one of
journalism's avowed ``sob sisters'' who was a friend of former
President Nixon and newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, died
Wednesday. She was 94.
   Mrs. St. Johns, whose reporting career spanned nearly 60 years
and included such major stories as the Lindbergh kidnapping, had
been hospitalized at the South County Convalescent Hospital.
   An ardent feminist and a pioneer in her field, Mrs. St. Johns
once wrote: ``I wish women would stand together and shackle the men
who want to move us backwards.''
   Hearst hired her as a cub reporter at the San Francisco Examiner
for $7 a week in 1913, a time when there were few women in the
newsroom.
   The following year, she transferred to the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner, another Hearst newspaper, and later worked for the
International News Service. ``She was a kind of wild, uninhibited
woman before feminism came in,'' said Mel Durslag, a Los Angeles
Herald Examiner sports columnist and 50-year Hearst veteran. ``She
was a tough, hard newspaper woman, one of the guys. She was a
figure from the old roaring days of Hearst journalism, which no
longer lives.''
   She covered the ``trial of the century'' of Bruno Richard
Hauptmann, charged in the kidnapping and murder of aviator Charles
A. Lindbergh's infant son. When Britain's Edward VIII abdicated,
she was assigned the story. Later, she covered the assassination of
Louisiana political boss Huey Long and the trial of Patty Hearst,
the publisher's granddaughter.
   She was an avowed ``sob sister,'' saying at one time, ``Unless
you move the heart of the country, you will never get it moving.''
   In 1962, she published ``Final Verdict,'' about her father,
renowned criminal lawyer Earl Rogers, but perhaps her best-received
book was ``The Honeycomb,'' an autobiography published in 1969.
   In 1924, she married William Ivan ``Ike'' St. Johns, the
Herald's chief copy editor. They were divorced, and she remarried
twice, with both those marriages also ending in divorce. She had
three children from her marriages.
   Mrs. St. Johns was a longtime friend of former President Nixon,
who in 1970 honored her as the only woman among eight journalists
awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
   The award cited her for ``exceptional ability to reveal the
human story behind the news.''

   A group of dissident Republicans and
supporters of television evangelist Pat Robertson on Wednesday
gained control of the Georgia delegation in a peacemaking deal that
left party regulars outraged and considering a boycott of the
national convention.
   Republican National Committee Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr.
said afterward that despite the bitterness in the dispute, he hoped
it would not damage the party's prospects in Georgia in the fall
election.
   The national committee approved the deal worked out by the
Committee on Contests, but even after the decision, the two sides
in the dispute could not agree on exactly what it meant.
   Georgia GOP Chairman John Stuckey said it gave 28 of the state's
48 national convention delegates to the dissidents, while Brant
Frost IV, chairman of the dissident group, said the division was
26-22 in his faction's favor.
   The division of the delegation caps a bitter six-month fight for
control of the Georgia Republican Party. Vice President George Bush
won the state's March 8 primary but Robertson supporters overran
the party's machinery at caucuses and conventions that followed the
primary.
   National officials of both the Robertson and Bush campaigns
became directly involved in negotiations to settle the dispute, and
in the end, Stuckey said that their will prevailed.
   Asked if the Bush campaign had leaned on him to accept an
agreement, Stuckey replied, ``No, they fell on me.''
   Negotiators included Rich Bond, deputy manager of the Bush
campaign, and Mark Nuttle, who had been manager of the Robertson
campaign.
   ``We are striving to get our family together on this and aim our
fire at Michael Dukakis and not at each other,'' Bond said.
   However, Stuckey said he doubted that the settlement would
achieve party harmony in Georgia.
   ``If the object of this exercise is to buy peace, it will have
the same effect as Mr. (Neville) Chamberlain ... to buy peace,''
said Stuckey, referring to the former British prime minister's
attempt to negotiate peace with Nazi Germany before World War II.
   Stuckey, who was picked as a delegate, asked the RNC to throw
out the deal. After losing he said he would not appeal the decision
and would not attend the national convention next week. He refused
to rule out that he would resign as state party chairman.
   ``I'm going to go home tonight, get a good night's sleep, get up
tomorrow, saddle my horse and go riding with my daughter,'' Stuckey
said.
   The two sides argued their case earlier this week amid
allegations of death threats and complaints of strong-arm tactics.
   Republicans failed to hold their state convention last May
because a dispute over who could be seated as delegates disrupted
the proceedings to the point that Stuckey said he feared a riot
would break out.
   The dissidents continued the May convention and chose their own
delegates, while Stuckey and other party leaders met later to elect
delegates. Although all 48 Georgia delegates are obligated to vote
for Bush, the fight was over who will cast those votes.

   The population of Asia topped 3 billion on
Wednesday, according to United Nations estimates.
   The report, issued by the U.N.'s Asian Forum of Parliamentarians
on Population and Development, estimated that the population hit
the 3 billion mark Wednesday at 12:47 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time
(8:47 p.m. EDT Tuesday).
   Seven babies are born every second in Asia, and the continent
accounts for about 60 percent of the global population, according
to the forum, which represents 19 Asian countries.
   ``The designation of a day marking the birth of the 3 billionth
baby in Asia is very symbolic,'' said Shigemi Kono, director of
Japan's National Institute of Population Problems. ``But I
personally think it is nonsense, because there is no way of
actually knowing when the 3 billionth baby was born.''
   Among Asian countries, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan face the
most serious population growth problems, Kono said.
   U.N. figures show that India, with 818 million people, has an
annual population growth rate of 2.08 percent. Pakistan, with a
population of 115 million, has a 3.45 percent growth rate and the
110 million population of Bangladesh is growing at a 2.67 percent
rate, according to the United Nations. By the year 2025, Asia will
have 4.5 billion inhabitants, according to the Tokyo-based Asian
Population and Development Association _ roughly equal to the
increase in the total world population from 1950 to 1980.
   The world population passed the 5 billion mark in July 1987,
according to the United Nations.

   Bank of New England Corp., a holding company
based in Boston, was granted permission by the Federal Reserve
Board on Wednesday to offer investment advice to both retail and
institutional customers.
   The board said the company can offer the service through a
subsidiary, New England Discount Brokerage Inc., which already
provides brokerage services.
   The Fed, in its order, noted that it has previously authorized
bank holding companies to offer investment advice in conjunction
with brokerage services to institutional customers, but it never
before permitted the combination with retail customers.
   The order forbids New England Discount Brokerage from trading
for its own account in any of the securities that it recommends. It
also provides that the board of directors of the brokerage must be
separate from the board of the parent holding company.
   Bank of New England Corp., with $28.8 billion in assets, is the
19th largest bank holding company in the nation. It operates
subsidiary banks in Massachussets, Connecticut, Maine and Rhode
Island.

   The FBI obtained a journalist's confidential notes

   Tony Avirgan said he learned last weekend that the FBI got the

   Avirgan said Dougherty told him he gave copies of the notes to
Jack Terrell, a former mercenary who was giving the FBI information
on alleged illegal activities connected with a private Contra aid
network, and that Terrell gave the FBI access to some of them.
   Avirgan told The Boston Globe that Dougherty's passing along of
the material was unauthorized and unethical, but Dougherty said he
thought he had Avirgan's permission to share it with Terrell.
   ``Obviously, I had no idea the material would end up in the
hands of the FBI,'' Dougherty said. He said he and Avirgan were
working together on a story in Costa Rica in 1985 when they shared
their notes.
   ``Both Tony and I were victimized by Jack Terrell, who was
working with the FBI and we had no knowledge of that,'' he said.
Dougherty said he had introduced Avirgan to Terrell at Avirgan's
request.
   ``I did so many things for Tony,'' Dougherty said. ``For him to
turn around and call me unethical after I created the whole
Terrell-Avirgan nexus at his request, I find shocking and a bit sad.
   ``I think they needed to find a scapegoat after the first story,
about the FBI breaking in. I don't think it was good enough for
them to just say the FBI didn't break in. They needed a scapegoat.
So I'm taking the hit.''
   Two weeks ago, the Globe said 39 pages of Avirgan's material
found in FBI files apparently were obtained during two breaks into
Avirgan's home in Costa Rica.
   Avirgan said at the time there was no other way the material,
including notes of interviews and private memos to his editor,
could have been acquired by the FBI.
   ``But after investigating this incident thoroughly, we now
realize that the FBI did not obtain the documents as a result of a
break-in or any other unethical or illegal action,'' Avirgan told
the Globe.
   ``We did suffer two break-ins, in 1985 and 1986, in which files
were rifled and, perhaps, photocopied,'' he said. ``We're still
looking for an explanation of those break-ins.''
   Dougherty's role was discovered last week when his handwriting
was found on one page of the material released by the FBI, the
Globe reported Wednesday.
   Avirgan said CBS News sent Dougherty to Costa Rica in 1985 to
help him and his journalist wife, Martha Honey, investigate an
assassination attempt against dissident Contra leader Eden Pastora.
   Avirgan said Dougherty told him last weekend that he provided
copies of Avirgan's notes to Terrell in exchange for Terrell's
material on a private Contra aid network.
   Terrell told the Globe the material was not part of a trade.
   John Mattes, a Florida lawyer, said that when Terrell was
approached by the FBI, ``I advised Terrell to cooperate fully with
the FBI and to give them everything he had. That's how CBS material
got into their files.''
   Greg Jones, a spokesman for the FBI, said Tuesday that FBI
Director William Sessions ``has maintained throughout that the
materials came to us from an individual who voluntarily provided
them to us. The FBI did not solicit the information nor did we know
how it was obtained.''
   Avirgan and Terrell said the FBI should have followed up on
material indicating illegal activities by members of the private
Contra aid network.
   ``We always said we wanted the FBI to carry on our investigation
and act on information we had uncovered,'' Avirgan said. ``We even
contacted the FBI in New York, and they showed no interest. Now we
know there is evidence of crimes sitting in their own files, and
still the FBI took no action.''
   The FBI's field office in Miami declined to release material on
the attempted assassination of Pastora because it is part of an
investigation, the Globe said.

<HEAD>Radar Staff Saw Collision Coming But Couldn't Warn Pilots</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADING throughout, with planes on radar up to collision. No
pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MILBURN, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radar operators watched two Royal Air
Force Tornado jet fighters heading for a collision but couldn't
warn them because the planes were keeping radio silence in
simulation of wartime conditions, the RAF said Wednesday night.
   Four airmen, three Britons and a West German trainee navigator,
were killed in the Tuesday night collision while on separate
flights in low-level night training exercises over the Cumbrian
hills of northwest England.
   The Defense Ministry launched an inquiry.
   Rescuers on Wednesday recovered the four bodies. Wreckage from
the $30 million, two-seater jets was scattered over a wide area
round the village of Milburn 240 miles from London.
   Hill rescue teams, guided by helicopters with powerful lights,
searched for the victims through the night in the remote, sparsely
populated area.
   Fifteen members of a local branch of the Round Table business
club were being shown around the RAF base at Spadeadam in Cumbria
as guests at the time of the collison. The base operates an
electronic warfare range against which the Tornado crews test their
skills.
   The business people told Wednesday how radar operators at the
base monitored the two planes up to the moment of collison without
being able to warn them of the impending disaster.
   George Beattie, one of the 15, said: ``There were two lines on
the screen representing the planes. Suddenly one disappeared and
the other changed to a dotted line which indicated a distress
signal. From that point on everyone knew something was amiss.
   ``There was a stunned silence. The only sound was the voice of a
controller at another base trying to make contact with the two
missing aircraft. Then there was nothing. There was a feeling of
shock and total disbelief among everyone.''
   The ministry identified the victims as three RAF flight
lieutenants, pilots Colin Oliver and John Watts and navigator
Anthony Cook, and West German Air Force Lt. Ulrich Sayer, 23, who
had been on retraining with the RAF since May.
   The RAF said in a statement that one plane had taken off from
the RAF base at Cottesmore in the English Midlands piloted by
Watts, an instructor at the Tornado Training Unit there. Sayer was
the navigator.
   The other plane, piloted by Oliver with Cook as navigator, had
taken off from the RAF base at Marham in eastern England
accompanied by a third Tornado.
   The crew of the third Tornado saw the collision but their craft
was not involved. Unable to help, they returned to Marham.
   ``A big red ball (of fire) came in the sky. I didn't know
whether it was the sun coming up,'' said witness Alan Knell,
landlord of the village pub, the Stag Inn.
   ``It was just a mass of bright red ... and then rockets and
flares went off and then there was another sort of explosion,''
Knell said in a radio interview.
   He said the planes narrowly missed the pub.
   The armed forces minister, Roger Freeman, said in a BBC radio
interview: ``Low-flying training, which is mostly at day with a
small proportion at night, is absolutely essential for our air
crews.
   ``They file a flight path with their station and it is logged
centrally but there would be no reason why a single aircraft would
know another military aircraft was in the vicinity.''
   The RAF said that in simulation of wartime conditions, the
low-flying Tornadoes traveling at more than 400 mph, maintain radio
silence and that the only way to avoid a collision in such
circumstances is visually to spot the other plane coming.
   The area is regularly used for such flights, in which the jets
skim a few hundred feet over hills and farm buildings, practicing
flying under radar search beams.
   The accident was the 10th involving RAF jets this year and
provoked demands from lawmakers that safety measures be tightened.
   The RAF has 220 Tornados, its main fighter, in service in
Britain and 165 on order.
   The Tornado was jointly developed and built by Britain, West
Germany and Italy and first came into service in 1979.
   Last May, two RAF crewmen were killed in the crash of a Tornado
in West Germany last May.

   Northern European scientists opened a two-day
meeting Wednesday to try to shed light on what is killing seals by
the thousands along their coasts, a sponsor of the gathering said.
   The environmental group Greenpeace, which is sponsoring the
meeting with the University of London, said the scientists will try
to assess the number of deaths, their cause and remedies.
   About 7,000 diseased harbor seals have died since April, about
half the population in the North Sea waters of West Germany, the
Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.
   Environmentalists blame the deaths on pollution, but scientists
say they are uncertain about what causes the viral infections that
are killing the animals.
   ``While governments argue over who is to blame for the current
crisis in the North and Baltic seas, the common seal in this area
faces extinction,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Andrew Booth.
   The 12 scientists at the meeting come from Britain, Denmark, the
Netherlands, West Germany, Norway and Sweden, said Greenpeace press
spokeswomen Sue Adams.

   Japanese-Americans said Wednesday that a
newly signed reparations law giving $20,000 each to those banished
by the U.S. government to internment camps during World War II is a
token payment, but meaningful.
   ``In our eyes, today's passage of the Japanese-American Redress
Bill marks a major achievement _ the achievement of a measure of
justice long denied, and so long overdue,'' said Jim Kajiwara, a
former internee. ``The Japanese-American internees and their
families have waited a long lifetime for this vindication.''
   Kajiwara joined several other former internees and their
descendants at a packed news conference inside the headquarters of
the Japanese-American Citizens League, which began a campaign for
redress 10 years ago.
   The law signed Wednesday by President Reagan in Washington also
provides an apology and a $50 million trust fund for educational
projects related to the 1942 mass internment of 120,000
Japanese-Americans, who were held in camps surrounded by barbed
wire and armed guards.
   ``I would like to emphasize that the $20,000 awarded to each
surviving internee must be considered a token amount only,'' said
former internee Ben Takeshita. ``Twenty thousand dollars could not
begin to compensate a person for his or her lost freedom, for the
loss of property, for the loss of livelihood, for the stigma of
disloyalty.
   ``But the $20,000 means that our government is sincere in its
apology. It is a token payment, yes, but it is a meaningful one.''
   Dale Minami, who heads the state attorney general's Asian
Pacific American Advisory Committee, said the law confirms what
Japanese-Americans knew all along _ that the internees were not
disloyal or dangerous and that there was no justification for their
internment.
   ``Japanese-Americans did not fail the government, the government
failed Japanese-Americans,'' said Minami.
   ``This bill will restore at least some of the dignity of
Japanese-Americans,'' he said.
   The happiness and relief were echoed elsewhere.
   In Southern California, Dorothy Shundo took a copy of her birth
certificate from her purse, saying her brother gave it to her when
her family was forced to leave its West Covina home.
   ``I carried it for 45 years. I hope no other group of Americans
feel they have to prove their citizenship,'' she said.
   The Japanese-Americans were rounded up and sent to internment
camps after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, plunged
the United States into World War II. About 60,000 people remain
alive and eligible for the payments.

   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz met
Wednesday with Rodrigo Borja, Ecuador's new president, and
criticized an anti-American mural that hangs in the hall where the
country's Congress meets.
   Shultz was among numerous international dignitaries attending
the inauguration of Borja, a moderate leftist who has promised a
non-aligned foreign policy.
   The secretary was booed by part of a crowd of several hundred
people waiting outside the Congress building Wednesday evening
prior to the inauguration. Shultz, guarded by two policemen armed
with sub-machine guns, had no reaction.
   Shultz met with Borja before the inauguration and later said the
45-minute meeting was cordial and served to reaffirm ``the good
relations that exist between Ecuador and the United States.
   ``We discussed our joint interests in doing everything possible
about the narcotics problem, the terrorism problem. We discussed
economic issues, the debt problem,'' Shultz said.
   In an apparent reference to Borja's announced plans to impose
controls on Ecuador's free-market economy, Shultz said:
   ``I think that one of the things that is just crystal clear in
the world these days is that the method of running an economy by
central control, as advocated by the left, simply doesn't work.''
   Shultz, speaking to reporters after the meeting, also criticized
a huge mural hanging in the meeting hall of Congress.
   ``I have been told there is a mural and that the mural has two
messages in it. One is a message of insult to the United States and
the other is a message about the desirability, as the painter sees
it, of the programs of the far left,'' Shultz said.
   The mural, 30 yards long and 10 yards high, is painted on the
wall behind the speaker's podium. A skull with a Nazi helmet that
contains the letters ``CIA'' is depicted prominently in the mural.
   The highly impressionistic mural contains scenes of children
sleeping in the street, the struggles of landless peasants and many
scenes and symbols that reflect class struggle.
   Shultz denied local press reports that said U.S. officials had
considered boycotting Borja's inauguration ceremony because of the
mural.
   Shultz said the mural may have been designed to cause him not to
``go to this inauguration and join in celebrating democracy.
   ``I have come here to pay my respects to democracy and freedom
and the rule of law,'' Shultz said. ``This is an occasion when a
man is inaugurated as a result of an election in the democratic
tradition. So I am here to honor that.''
   The mural was painted by Ecuador's leading artist, Osvaldo
Guayasamin. It was unveiled last week and immediately sparked a
controversy because of the anti-American symbolism.
   The U.S. Embassy refused comment on local press reports that
said U.S. Ambassador Richard Holwill had complained to Borja, whose
Democratic Left Party controls Congress, and was told by Borja the
mural was solely the responsibility of the painter.
   Guayasamin, who says he is a leftist, defended the mural in an
interview in the Quito newspaper Hoy. He said his mural depicted
the political violence that is part of Ecuador's history and that
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency is largely to blame for the
violence.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers broke up a prayer vigil
Wednesday by about 500 Roman Catholics upset over the government's
expulsion of a Canadian priest, Haiti's Catholic radio station
reported.
   Troops fired into the air and arrested five people standing
guard outside the church where a courtyard vigil was being held,
Radio Soleil reported.
   The soldiers arrested the five at 2 a.m., then returned with a
judge at 11 a.m. to scatter hundreds of parishioners holding the
vigil at Gand Goave, about 30 miles west of Port-au-Prince, the
radio said.
   No reason was given for disrupting the vigil, nor was it
revealed where the five were taken. Two of them were young members
of the leftist United Democratic Confederation, Radio Soleil said.
   The Rev. Rene Poirier, the Canadian who ran the Grand Goave
church, was arrested and expelled last Friday.
   The Haitian Bishops Council said in a statement broadcast by
Radio Soleil Wednesday that it ``cannot accept the brutal manner in
which Father Rene Poirier was arrested in his presbytery in Grand
Goave.''
   A government communique accused Poirier of disturbing Haiti's
``social and political order'' after he refused to give a local
police official the names of parishioners who attended a recent
sermon, radio stations said.
   Poirier lived in Haiti for four years. He belonged to the
militant wing of the church that opposes the military government
and calls on the poor to organize politically.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy deposed President Leslie Manigat in June
and sent him into exile, ending four months of civilian rule.
Namphy previously headed a junta that ruled Haiti for two years
after former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in
February 1986.

<DATELINE>GRANBY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Selectmen have turned to the state for help
in banishing billboards featuring green dinosaurs in their long
battle with the owner of a dinosaur footprint museum.
   The board voted Monday to ask the Highway Department to survey
all road signs along state highways that run through the town to
see whether they are legal.
   ``What is this when they go surveying every sign in town?''
asked Carlton S. Nash, owner of Dinosaur Land, which has four
billboards along Routes 202 and 116. ``It's nothing but
harassment.''
   Owen P. Jacobsen, chairman of the board of selectmen, said the
request was prompted by the signs that advertise the quarry and
dinosaur museum, but said the town has not singled out Dinosaur
Land.
   ``It's not only enforcement of the law, but we're trying to make
our business district more presentable,'' Jacobsen said.
   Nash has owned the quarry for nearly a half-century and the
signs have stood almost that long. For 20 years or so, the signs
have also advertised what Nash calls his cancer research on
chickens.
   ``You'd be surprised the number of people who came into my shop
this weekend and said, `Mr. Nash, I'm surprised the town is getting
into such smallness about the signs,''' he said.
   Nash maintains his signs are legal even though they are 12 feet
too close to the road because a grandfather clause permits signs
that were erected before local laws were changed in 1974.
   But under a state law that supersedes town law, there is no
grandfather clause, Jacobsen said. State law requires billboards to
be 660 feet from a state highway, said Administrative Officer
Donald Kjelmyr.

<TEXT>
   An 800-pound man was evicted by
forklift Wednesday, hoisted onto a flatbed truck and trundled off
to a hospital as officials searched for a new home for him and his
400-pound mother.
   ``You'll be fine, Michael, you'll be fine,'' Arlene Edelman
assured her 24-year-old son after their dilapidated bungalow was
torn apart and he was extricated.
   Edelman, secured to a mattress by leather straps and covered
with a blue blanket, replied from the truck, ``I don't want to go
to the hospital.''
   Authorities had been trying since April to evict the Edelmans
from their bungalow, the last one occupied in an old summer colony
here, but various legal procedures had delayed the action until
Wednesday.
   The landlord, Ronald Fish, wants to redevelop the property.
   Edelman first entered the public eye in December, when a tow
truck was used to help him after he fell out of bed.
   The eviction began about 7 a.m. as Rockland County workers tore
down a wall of the blue house the Edelmans have occupied for more
than two years. Edelman, who has long been confined to bed, has not
left the house in that time.
   Medical teams from Good Samaritan and Nyack Hospitals were on
hand, as were Edelman's personal physician and the head of
emergency room services at Good Samaritan.
   Edelman was rolled from his mattress onto a second mattress atop
a slab of plywood on the forklift. The machine lifted him onto the
truck as neighbors, friends and reporters looked on and his mother
comforted him.
   ``I'll see you soon, Michael,'' she assured him.
   Asked how he felt, Edelman said he wasn't ``the only homeless
person in Rockland.''
   He said he was reluctant to leave his mother and didn't know why
the county Department of Social Services hadn't been able to find
him a new home. The Edelmans live on Supplemental Security Income
of $714 a month.
   County officials spent the last several months combing through
real estate ads and contacting 2,000 real estate agents in the
region to find a new home that can accommodate Edelman.
   The county has even sought property for a trailer Fish agreed to
donate, but with no success.
   Edelman, who has been getting weight-loss assistance from
exercise expert Richard Simmons and Walter Hudson, the former
1,200-pound Long Island man who has lost half his weight, was
accepted into an obesity program at Downstate Hospital, but refused
to be separated from his mother.
   The county will house Edelman at the Dr. Robert L. Yeager Health
Complex in Pomona for a few days, said county spokesman Kenneth
Seltman. ``This is very temporary,'' said Seltman. ``He needs to be
in a specialized program.''
   Seltman said the cost of Wednesday's eviction had not been
tabulated.
   Mrs. Edelman, 47, who weighs 400 pounds, said her son would only
be at the center for ``shelter for a few days.''
   She said she and Edelman's girlfriend, Brenda Bedell, 30, would
stay in a motel and continue to look for a place to live.
   The county commissioner of social services, Noah Weinberg, said
a landlord in Garnerville had agreed to rent Edelman an apartment
but needed time to make the necessary renovations for the man and
his mother.

<TEXT>
   The government decreed a day of
national mourning for Arnulfo Arias Madrid, the defiant former
president ousted three times by military coups who died in exile in
Miami on Wednesday.
   The Panamanian flag will be flown at half staff for eight days
starting Monday, the day of mourning. Arias Madrid's family said he
will be buried in Panama City on that day, when the former
president would have turned 87.
   Arias Madrid had been living in exile in Miami and died
Wednesday of a heart attack, Panamanian Consul Roberto Dominguez
said there.
   Opposition leaders in Panama, meanwhile, expressed sorrow over
the death.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian Democratic
Party, said the former president represented ``the figure of a
great rebel'' who had a social conscience and was ``concerned about
those who have less and for those who suffer more.'' He is not
related to Arias Madrid.
   Arias Calderon ran as a vice president on Arias Madrid's
presidential ticket in 1984 for the opposition Authenic Panamanian
Party.
   The government party's candidate narrowly won that election,
which the opposition labeled fraudulent. Many also felt the
military stole a 1964 electoral victory from Arias Madrid.
   Arias Madrid was president of Panama in 1940-41, 1949-51 and for
11 days in 1968. Each time, he was ousted by the military.
   However, he continued to speak out against the Defense Forces,
in 1986 charging them with killing opposition leader Hugo
Spadafora, who had accused the government of involvement with drugs.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler as head of
the 15,000-member Defense Forces, was indicted last February in
Florida on drug trafficking charges. He denies the accusations.
   Guillermo Endara, undrsecretary of the Panamanian Authentic
Party, said Arias Madrid was ``the indisputable leader'' of Panama
for the past 57 years.
   Carlos Ivan Zuniga, president of the Popular Action Party, said,
``There is no doubt that his death is going to constitute a
tremendous uncertainty, leave a vacuum. A very interesting era in
national life ... has closed.''
   The last coup against Arias Madrid marked the beginning of the
military's domination of Panama's government, first under Gen. Omar
Torrijos, who died in a 1981 plane crash, and then by Noriega.
   Arias Madrid feared returning to Panama because of his
opposition to Noriega, Dominguez said.

   President Reagan signed a bill Wednesday
providing $20,000 reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during
World War II, conceding that ``no payment can make up for those
lost years.''
   At least one family among the approximately 250 veterans of the
internment camps who attended the eight-minute signing ceremony
said no payment is necessary because of the opportunity they have
enjoyed as Americans.
   Reagan told the audience that tens of thousands of
Japanese-Americans lived in internment camps ``not for a matter of
weeks or months, but for three long years.''
   The bill signed by the president provides for a $20,000 tax-free
payment to each ofthe 60,000 survivors among the approximately
120,000 Japanese-Americans who were interned.
   ``Yet no payment can make up for those lost years,'' Reagan
said. ``So what is most important in this bill has less to do with
property than with honor, for here we admit a wrong.''
   Dr. Walter Emori, 47, an arthritis specialist in Medford, Ore.,
speaking for himself and the other five members of the family who
were interned, told a reporter earlier: ``I don't feel animosity,
and I don't feel a sense that the country owes this to me.''
   All six members of the family _ now living in California,
Georgia and Oregon _ attended the signing ceremony to dramatize
their intention to use the money to repay the country, in Emori's
words, ``for the good that came out of the awful.''
   The Japanese-Americans were rounded up and sent to internment
camps after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, plunged
the United States into World War II.
   Many Japanese-Americans lobbied for the legislation for years.
It finally cleared Congress by a 257-156 vote in the House on Aug.
4.
   Reagan originally objected to some features of the bill, saying
it would be too costly, but he backed the final version. It calls
for a trust fund of $1.2 billion, with appropriations in any one
year limited to $500 million. Legislation providing the actual
money must still be enacted.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president always
endorsed the purpose of the bill.
   Asked whether the large number of Japanese-American voters in
California, a crucial state in the forthcoming presidential
election, was a factor in Reagan's decision to support the measure,
Fitzwater said: ``No. That was not a factor in any way.''
   The internment order issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt
in 1942 required all people of Japanese ancestry living in
California, Washington and Oregon and some in Hawaii to be
relocated. It affected 77,000 U.S. citizens and 43,000 legal and
illegal resident aliens. They were taken to camps in Western and
Southern staes.
   Susumu and Sumi Emori and their four children, then living on a
potato farm south of Stockton, Calif., were taken to a camp in
Rohwer, Ark.
   ``It was a real hard experience for us,'' said Walter Emori, who
was 3 years old when the family was interned.
   But, he added in an interview, ``I don't feel animosity, and I
don't feel a sense that the country owes this to me. I don't feel
that, and I think many Japanese-Americans don't. We see this as a
healing process which says the country recognizes that a wrong was
being done and in one small way perhaps is trying to make amends
for this.''
   ``And we as a family would like to take this gesture the next
step further and say we'd like to give this back to the country for
the good that came out of the awful.''
   For the Emori family, there has been a lot of good. After they
left the camp, the Seventh-day Adventist Church gave the parents
jobs at the church-affiliated Loma Linda University in California.
They worked there until their retirement.
   All four of the children attended Loma Linda. Walter went on to
its medical school. His two sisters received master's degrees from
its nursing school. One, Helen King, who was 7 when the family was
interned, is now dean of the Loma Linda nursing school.
   The other, Grace, who was 5, is a senior nursing employee at the
federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Walter Emori's
younger brother, David, who was 1, is in business in Santa Cruz,
Calif.
   Emori said family members haven't decided what to do with the
$120,000 they will get, but they are considering applying it toward
an endowed professorship at the university.
   ``One thing that makes some Americans feel a little uneasy about
this bill is that the Japanese-Americans in this country have done
exceptionally well both by way of education and by way of material
things,'' Emori said.
   ``You can look at us as a segment of the American population and
say, `Why give them anything? They've done so well; I mean, they've
made a tremendous go out of our society.''
   The family's plan for use of the money, he said, is designed
``to honor our parents, to (thank) the church and especially the
university for helping us with a job and with education, and,
probably most important, to our country, to say something good
about an awful time in our lives.''
   Arrangements for the family to attend the signing ceremony were
made by Dr. Gary Ross, government relations officer for the World
Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

<TEXT>
   Rodrigo Borja, a socialist who has
promised a non-aligned foreign policy and an end to Ecuador's
free-market economy, was sworn in Wednesday as Ecuador's new
president.
   Borja received the oath of office and presidential sash from
Wilfrido Lucero, president of Congress.
   Leaders ranging from U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz to
President Fidel Castro of Cuba were present for the ceremony.
   ``We have received a country in moral and economic bankruptcy,
with a worrisome degradation of ethics in the highest government
circles,'' Borja said in his inaugural speech.
   He also announced an emergency economic program to combat
Ecuador's fiscal crisis, but gave no details.
   ``We cannot speak of democracy where there are impoverished
masses forced to beg for bread in the streets or sleep beneath
bridges,'' Borja said.
   He charged that the free market economic policies of outgoing
President Leon Febres Cordero had fueled inflation and impoverished
this South American nation.
   ``You don't have to be an economist to know that. It is enough
to go to the market, walk along country roads or visit shantytowns
to feel the daily drama of poor people,'' Borja said.
   Castro is making his first visit to South America since he
traveled to Chile in 1971 as the guest of Marxist President
Salvador Allende, who was ousted in a military coup two years later.
   Other presidents attending the inauguration Wednesday night were
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Jaime Lusinchi of Venezuela, Virgilio
Barco of Colombia, Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, Julio Sanguinetti of
Uruguay and Mario Soares of Portugal.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua had to delay his arrival
until Thursday morning. Ecuador and Nicaragua do not have
diplomatic relations.
   Ties were broken in October 1985 by Febres Cordero, an
archconservative who championed free enterprise and was the Reagan
administration's closest ally in South America.
   Borja, a 53-year-old law professor who is a vice president of
the Socialist International and head of Ecuador's Democratic Left
Party, has said that one of his first official acts will be to
restore ties with Nicaragua.
   Shultz said he would not meet with Castro. U.S. officials have
said Washington can work with Borja and that he is no threat to
democracy in Ecuador.
   Earlier Wednesday, Shultz met for 45 minutes with Borja and said
afterwards that the meeting was cordial.
   ``We discussed our joint interests in doing everything possible
about the narcotics problem, the terrorism problem. We discussed
economic issues, the debt problem,'' Shultz said.
   Ecuador, a nation of 10 million people about the size of
Colorado, returned to democracy in 1979 after nine years of
civilian and military dictatorships.
   In a farewell speech before the inaugural crowd, Febres Cordero,
57, defended his four years in office in what he called Ecuador's
worst economic crisis in history.
   He noted that the international price of oil, which provides 60
percent of Ecuador's export earnings and half of the government's
revenue, plunged from $27 a barrel in 1984 to $8 in 1986 and has
recovered to only $13.
   Ecuador's economy also was severely damaged by earthquakes that
crippled the country's vital oil industry for nearly six months in
1987, he said.
   ``Ecuador lost more than $3 billion from the sinking of
international petroleum prices and unexpected and incredibly
destructive natural disasters,'' he said.
   Febres Cordero said despite the handicaps, his government built
100,000 homes for the poor and 17 hospitals, expanded public
medical care and brought piped water to nearly a thousand
communities.
   He also noted his success in frustrating attempts by drug
traffickers to make Ecuador a producer of cocaine.
   At the end of his two-hour address, Febres Cordero left for his
hometown of Guayaquil, where his followers planned a reception.
   Febres Cordero earlier announced that he would not personally
turn over the presidential sash to Borja, who lost a bitterly
fought election runoff to him in 1984.
   Borja won the presidency in May, defeating populist candidate
Abdala Bucaram. Febres Cordero was not eligible for re-election.
   The new president inherits a country whose economy shrank by 3.5
percent in 1987. His major economic challenge will be to lower a 60
percent inflation rate, the highest in five years, and create jobs.
Less than half of the work force has full-time employment.
   Borja says he does not plan to nationalize major industries
because state-run enterprises are inefficient. But he has pledged
to impose controls on the economy, saying a free market in a
developing country like Ecuador benefits the rich and hurts the
poor.
   He has said he will impose exchange controls, restrict imports
to save scarce dollar reserves and regulate prices of basic
consumer goods to fight inflation.
   He also plans a more restrictive foreign investment policy and a
moratorium on foreign debt payments if creditors do not agree to
easier terms.
   Febres Cordero took pride in meeting payments on Ecuador's $9.2
billion debt. But since January no payments have been made, and
Ecuador is more than $1 billion in arrears.

   Republican platform writers backed
catastrophic-illness health coverage for children Wednesday, but
refused to endorse the recommendations of the presidential AIDS
commission, including anti-discrimination legislation.
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the maverick Connecticut Republican,
had pushed for both planks.
   While endorsing the principal of catastrophic coverage for
children, the Republicans shied away from any dollar commitments.
   Weicker won the 53-30 vote after assuring fellow delegates there
was ``no financial commitment involved ... but rather a commitment
of spirit by this party.''
   Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, former U.S. treasurer from Irvine,
Calif., warned that the Republicans who have pilloried the
Democratic platform as deceitful might be headed down the same
path. The GOP platform pledges not to raise taxes, but ``we all
know (catastrophic coverage) is going to be expensive,'' she said.
   On AIDS, the delegates voted by voice not to endorse the
presidential commission's report. President Reagan has rejected the
commission's advice to seek new anti-discrimination legislation to
protect AIDS victims.
   Vice President George Bush, who will receive the party's
presidential nomination next week, has endorsed the AIDS commission
report.
   ``Our president hasn't signed off on this report,'' said Rep.
Chuck Lewis of California, a platform co-chairman.
   The delegates left intact their AIDS plank, which calls for a
vigorous fight against the disease, ``compassion and help'' for
victims and the taking of steps to ``protect those who do not have
the disease.''
   Rich Montoya of Las Cruces, N.M., said the AIDS plank ``shows
what this party is all about. It shows compassion for those poor
individuals that are afflicted with AIDS, but it shows reason in
protecting the vast majority of our constituents that are
unafflicted by this disease.''
   Earlier, the platform writers endorsed the idea of a
constitutional amendment to limit the terms of senators and members
of the House, rejected a Weicker amendment to commit the party to
preserve the Small Business Administration and declared the party a
champion of women as well as minorities.
   The 106-member Platform Committee was aiming for a Thursday
conclusion to drafting of the document that will be presented to
the convention on Tuesday.
   Going line-by-line over the 30,000-word document crafted by its
staff and revised by subcommittees Tuesday, the full committee also
accepted an amendment by Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut
promising the party will ``work to assure access to health care for
all Americans through public and private initiatives.''
   The draft, sticking with the main tenets of the GOP's
conservative 1984 platform, includes a firm pledge not to raise
taxes, endorses constitutional amendments to ban abortion and
balance the federal budget, and calls for ``rapid and certain
deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative.''
   In a plank on economic opportunity, the delgates inserted
``women'' in the phrase, ``the GOP is the natural champion of
blacks, minorities, women and ethnic Americans.'' Ming Chen Hsu of
Westfield, N.J., suggested the change.
   Polls have indicated that more women tend to favor Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis over Bush.
   James Summers of Bellevue, Wash., opposed the amendment, saying,
``We should no more have women in our platform than we have men.
... It would be absolutely pandering to a single constituency where
we appear, according to the pollsters, to be having a problem.''
   The delegates heatedly debated the platform's proposed hard line
against abortion, including a declaration that ``the unborn child
has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be
infringed.''
   They voted 55-32 to reject an attempt by Marjorie Bell Chambers
of Los Alamos, N.M., to delete the last four words.
   ```Cannot be infringed' says to me that men and fetuses have a
right to life at all times, but women lost that right when they
become pregnant,'' said Chambers.
   The delegates rejected by voice a Weicker amendment to support
Medicaid funding of abortion in the case of rape or incest, despite
a plea from Rep. Johnson to recognize that ``rape is awful.''
   ``Murder under any circumstances is also a terrible crime,''
replied pro-life delegate Pat Elf of Kihei, Hawaii.
   The committee also rejected after a perfunctory debate a
pro-Equal Rights Amendment statement sought by Delaware's Lynn
Glaze.
   The Platform Committee adjourned for the night after rejecting
two Weicker amendments on educating the handicapped and the rights
of the disabled, while approving a third calling for Medicaid to
cover community-based services.
   The committee had completed its draft plank on the economy and
most of its section on family issues. That left five other sections
_ education, agriculture, energy-environment-transportation,
defense and foreign policy _ to be hammered out Thursday.
   Weicker said, ``We're managing to win a few small victories.''
Earlier, however, he said the platform was shaping up as only
``slightly better'' than the party's ``disastrous'' 1984 platform.
He predicted, ``This is the last platform hurrah, believe me, of
the far right.''
   The Republicans also released what they said was a GOP staff
estimate of how much implicit promises in the Democratic platform
will wind up costing taxpayers: $43.1 billion in 1989 alone.
   Sen. Robert Kasten said the Republicans assume Dukakis would end
up embracing costly, specific legislation that Democrats have
already introduced in Congress.

   Senate Democrats forced their plan to aid
Nicaragua's Contra rebels through the Senate on Wednesday but
failed to tempt President Reagan and Senate Republicans to join
them in a bipartisan coalition and defuse what could become an
explosive election-year issue.
   The 49-47 largely party-line vote approved the Democratic
package which provides $27 million in non-lethal ``humanitarian''
aid to the Contras and establishes a process by which Congress
could approve the release of $16.3 million in stockpiled arms to
the Contras later this year.
   Voting for it were Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the Democratic
vice presidential candidate and 48 other Democrats. No Republican
voted in the majority. Voting against the package were four
Democrats and 43 Republicans.
   Revival of Contra aid has yet to be taken up in the House, where
Democrats have an even larger majority. The Senate package is to be
attached to a defense appropriations measure already passed by the
House and it will be up to a conference committee to decide how to
deal with the issue before it ultimately comes up again in both the
Senate and the House when the conference report is considered.
   The partisan nature of the Senate vote also marked the failure
of a long period of negotiations aimed at forming a broad
bipartisan coalition behind U.S.-Nicaraguan policy.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., called the vote ``a tragically missed
opportunity.''
   ``No matter how many miles one walks you still can't get some
people to agree,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W,.Va., in a bitter and angry speech moments before the vote.
   ``You can inscribe your name in blood on a shaft of marble and
they still won't believe you,'' Byrd said of his attempts to
convince Republicans that Democrats were sincere in pursuing a
process that could lead to the resumption of arms shipments to the
Contras.
   ``They won't listen to reason,'' he said. ``They are suspicious
of everybody. They are paranoid. I can't understand that kind of
person in the United States Senate.''
   Byrd said he had expected a signal by the White House accepting
the Democratic plan after the 57-39 defeat of a rival proposal
offered by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas which would
have made immediately available $16.3 million in stockpiled and
already authorized military aid available to the Contras.
   ``I'm sick and tired of a White House that has no steel in its
guts,'' Byrd said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater expressed regret over
defeat of the Dole amendment, but said that the administration
subseqently ``indicated that the Byrd amendment ... was minimally
acceptable in light of our judgment of the best interests of the
freedom fighters.''
   ``We hope that this legislation, which now goes to conference
with the House, can be improved to provide effective support for
the freedom fighters in Nicragua,'' he said. ``A viable resistance
remains essential to the cause of freedom and democracy in Central
America.''
   Republican senators, speaking immediately before the vote, said
the entire directorate of the Contra insurgents oppose the
Democratic package because they believe it would never result in
new military aid.
   ``It's time to go back to the drawing board and find a real
package of Contra aid which will be effective and not a fig leaf
which will lead the Contras to despair and defeat,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
   ``This is one of those times when you can't reach bipartisan
consensus,'' Dole told the Senate.
   Noting that many of those voting for the Democratic plan have
opposed Contra aid in the past, Dole said: ``There are some of us
on this side of the aisle who look at some of those who are about
to vote for Contra aid with disbelief and skepticism.''
   Accusing the Democrats of using their Contra-aid plan as ``a big
umbrella, political cover'' in this presidential election year,
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas urged support of his
proposal to bring the Contras new military aid.
   ``I think this is a line-in-the-sand vote,'' Dole said. ``It is
a vote on whether you want to send effective military aid to the
Contras or not.''
   Byrd urged Republican support for his rival Democratic proposal,
with its built-in guarantees against a filibuster, as the only
approach that has a chance of actually getting aid to the Contras.
   The Byrd plan, supported by an unusally broad Democratic
coalition of Contra-aid supporters and opponents, provides no new
military aid for the Contras.
   But it sets the terms for a possible second House and Senate
vote this fall which could release $16.3 million of stockpiled and
previously authorized arms aid to the Contras.
   ``This approach keeps the options open and on a fast track,''
Byrd told the Senate. ``I hope my amendment will receive bipartisan
support and send a signal to the Nicaraguan government in the
strongest possible way.''
   Byrd had threatened to cut short a long-scheduled summer recess
and reconvene the Senate immediately after next week's Republican
National Convention in New Orleans if prolonged debate prevented
action on his Contra-aid plan this week.
   ``It's absolutely silly to remain obstinate,'' he said. ``This
amendment provides something. Without it the Contras get nothing.
Nothing.''
   But Republicans complained that the Byrd plan is unworkable and
cannot guarantee that aid can actually be delivered to Contra
forces inside Nicaragua. They said that postponing the decision
whether to rearm the Contras may doom them as an effective fighting
force against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   The Byrd plan, which was offered as an amendment to a Defense
Department appropriations bill, would provide $27 million in
non-lethal humanitarian aid to the Contras after current funds run
out on Oct. 1. It also would provide $5 million in medical help to
the ``innocent civilian victims of the war in Nicaragua.''
   The plan also calls for accelerated votes later this year _ with
a 10-hour limit on debate _ to release the $16.3 million in
previously authorized military aid if President Reagan certifies
that Nicaragua has created an emergency in Central America that
threatens the existence of the Contras.
   It bars the Central Intelligence Agency or the Defense
Department from delivering the aid and directs the Agency for
International Development (AID) to do the job.
   Dole's rival plan, offered as an amendment to another spending
bill, would provide the $27 million in non-lethal aid and also
release the stockpiled arms immediately.
   At one time, Dole also had been proposing $20 million in
immediate military aid, but revised that prior to the vote on his
amendment to settle for immediately release of the $16.3 million
stockpile.

   An engine caught fire on a United Airlines
jet during takeoff Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of 102
passengers and five crew members, authorities said. Seven people
were injured.
   The twin-engine Boeing 737 bound for Chicago was taxiing down a
runway at Little Rock Regional Airport about 9:30 a.m. when the
fire was spotted and the takeoff was aborted, United spokesman
Charles Novak said.
   Airport firefighters doused the burning engine, he said.
   Many of the passengers, who exited through emergency door and
window exits, jumped from the wing of the plane to the ground and
were injured. Seven people were treated at hospitals, authorities
said.
   Most of the passengers caught the next flight out to Chicago.
   Novak said airline officials had not determined what caused the
fire.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were
at the airport late Wednesday to investigate the accident.

<TEXT>
   A group of black ministers said Wednesday it
has called on the American Civil Liberties Union to fight a new
police policy of randomly stopping and questioning black teen-agers.
   The policy was instituted by Chief Marti Felker last month in an
attempt to stop racial violence in the Old West End, a racially
mixed neighborhood.
   ``We consider the police chief's directive at the very least
insensitive and provacative and at the very most racist and
unconstitutional,'' said the Rev. Floyd Rose, pastor of the Family
Baptist Church.
   ``It is for this very reason that we have requested that the
ACLU file suit in federal court to enjoin the mayor, the city
manager and the police chief from enforcing what we consider an
unconstitutional directive,'' he said Wednesday at a news
conference.
   Harland Britz, general counsel for the ACLU's Toledo office,
said the policy appears to violate constitutional protections
against illegal search and seizure. He said the ACLU would look
into the matter.
   City Manager Philip Hawkey declined comment until he had a
chance to review the policy.
   The ministers planned to meet with Felker to discuss the issue.
Rose, who also is director of the Coalition for Economic Justice,
said the ministers want the chief to rescind the order.
   Felker, in a July 8 letter to leaders of the Old West End
Association, said he instructed Deputy Chief Richard Kwiatkowski to
``pay special attention to groups of black juveniles'' in the
neighborhood.
   ``Officers are to stop and identify these youths so that in the
event an occurrence does take place, investigators will have the
names of the juveniles to work on,'' Felker said.
   His order resulted from complaints by Old West End residents,
who recorded three violent incidents involving black youths.
   Felker has defended his action, saying it was used two years ago
to stop whites from harassing blacks on the city's south end. Civil
rights leaders said while police watched white teen-agers in 1986,
they never stopped them.
   The Interdominational Ministerial Alliance, which includes
ministers from a variety of church congregations here, has asked
the U.S. Justice Department to investigate claims of a conspiracy
against black officials in Toledo.
   They claim that local media and officials have conspired to
treat blacks differently than whites _ most notably, by firing one
city employee and disciplining two others for alleged mismanagement
of a city housing program.
   About 17 percent of the city's 340,000 residents are black.

<HEAD>Ben Jones Disavows `Liberal' Tag, Democrats Plot To Keep Price
Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former actor Ben Jones, chosen by Georgia Democratic voters for
a rematch against a Republican congressman, said Wednesday his
challenge is to avoid being tagged a liberal. In southern Illinois,
a Democrat who retained a vacant House seat for his party turned to
campaigning to win it again in November.
   Jones, 47, who played a mechanic on the ``Dukes of Hazzard''
television series, said he will ``take the high road'' in the fall
campaign after defeating two rivals in Tuesday's primary for the
right to oppose Republican Rep. Pat Swindall.
   ``They're going to use the `L' word as much as possible to keep
from engaging their brains,'' said Jones, who won 47 percent of the
vote in a 1986 contest with the conservative congressman.
   In Illinois, Democrat Jerry Costello won a special election for
the 4{ months left in the U.S. House term of Rep. Mel Price, who
died in April at age 83. Costello, chairman of the St. Clair County
Board, is scheduled to be sworn in Thursday in Washington.
   Republican Robert Gaffner, a community college administrator,
lost by a 51.4 to 48.6 percent margin Tuesday, but can look forward
to a rematch with Costello in November. He said he was disappointed
but not discouraged, maintaining the closeness of the contest
demonstrates Costello's vulnerability.
   In Georgia's 4th Congressional District, Jones won 62 percent of
the vote against lawyer Nick Moraitakis' 21 percent and theater
executive John Stembler's 17 percent to capture the Democratic
nomination without a runoff.
   Swindall, who was unopposed for the GOP nomination, is widely
believed to be facing an uphill re-election battle following his
admission that he considered accepting laundered drug money to
finance the expensive home he built.
   The congressman said Tuesday night he thought the district's
voters would put questions over the loan ``in perspective'' and
decide the race on the basis of political philosophy. Jones, he
said, ``is an acknowledged liberal ... Pat Swindall is a
conservative.''
   Georgia Democratic voters also nominated David Worley, a
29-year-old lawyer, to challenge Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich.
Gingrich challenged Worley Tuesday night to an extensive series of
debates, saying he intended to show voters that organized labor and
the Democratic establishment in Washington were helping finance
Worley in retaliation for Gingrich's attack on the financial
dealings of U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Eight of Georgia's 10 congressmen won renomination without
opposition in the primary election. Both of those opposed were
victorious.
   Colorado had primaries in six congressional districts, but
almost no tight races, so voter turnout _ possibly as low as 10
percent of registered voters _ was ``atrocious,'' said state
Democratic Party Chairman Buie Seawell.
   Exact figures were unavailable, but calling the turnout poor
would be ``sort of the understatement of the decade,'' said
Secretary of State Natalie Meyer.
   In the contest that generated the most interest, Republicans in
a suburban district that includes Boulder County chose state Rep.
David Bath over former Secretary of State Mary Estill Buchanan, who
lost to Gary Hart in the 1980 Senate race.

   This country's powerful military
three times overthrew former President Arnulfo Arias Madrid, but it
unwittingly turned him into a national symbol of democratic
aspirations.
   The 86-year-old former president, who died Wednesday in exile in
Miami, ran for president again just four years ago. He was the top
contender in the country's first presidential election in 16 years.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, the president of the Christian
Democratic Party, said Wednesday, ``We feel a little orphaned by
his death.''
   ``Arias became the symbol of our nation's claim to have a
civilian government, in a democracy,'' he said. The two men are not
related.
   Nicolas Ardito Barletta won the 1984 presidential elections,
defeating Arias by a margin of 1,713 votes out of about 640,000
ballots cast. The count took place behing closed doors.
   When the official tally was released, Arias' supporters cried
fraud and foreign diplomats also questioned the results.
Demonstrators clashed with police and dozens were injured.
   Arias spent most of the last 12 months in Miami, while Panama
was undergoing a severe political and economic crisis.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's de facto ruler as
head of the Defense Forces, was indicted last February by a grand
jury in Florida and the United States has been applying strong
diplomatic and economic pressure to force him to resign and leave
the country.
   Persistent rumors over the past six months that Arias would soon
return to Panama appeared to invigorate his Authentic Panamanian
Party. However, younger people had taken over the party, and he
played no active role in the opposition's efforts to force
Noriega's resignation.
   A close aide of Arias said before the 1984 election that he had
tried to convince the Harvard-educated physician not to run for
president because of his age.
   ``I couldn't convince him because somebody from the (National)
Guard (now called the Defense Forces) had called him in December to
say that he wasn't acceptable as a candidate. Nobody can tell the
doctor what to do, and after that call there was no stopping him,''
said the aide, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The winner, Ardito Barletta, was the military's choice, but he
held office only 11 months before he was pressured to resign.
   His vice president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, was moved into the top
office. He served from September 1985 until last February, when he
tried to fire Noriega and the general had him replaced, too.
   Born Aug. 15, 1901, in Penonomee, a small town about 90 miles
west of Panama City, Arias had been active in Panamanian politics
since 1931.
   He frequently tangled with the military, which overthrew him in
1941, 1951 and 1968. Of his three four-year terms, the military let
him stay in office only a total 2{ years. In 1968, he lasted only
11 days.
   In addition to claiming victory in the 1984 election, his
supporters said he won in 1964.
   His brief terms in office were characterized by nationalistic
fervor aimed mainly at the powerful U.S. presence here. In later
years, he toned down the rhetoric and said he was a friend of the
United States.
   A staunch anti-communist, Arias said in an interview before the
1984 election that he had not sought the support of the Reagan
administration because, ``I don't want to seem like an instrument
of American initiatives.''
   He said Central American communists ``aren't interested in the
wars in Guatemala, Nicaragua or El Salvador but in obtaining
control of the Panama Canal.''
   Two of his major accomplishments while in office were to give
women the vote in 1940 and create a social security system.
   His reaction to his overthrow in 1941 became legend.
   ``You, fellow party members, fulfilled your obligation. I, as
president, fulfilled mine. These are traitors,'' he said of the
military as he left the presidential offices. ``We will return.''
   His periods of exile, including four years after the 1941
overthrow, turned the words ``We will return'' into a slogan.
   Arias was to be buried in Panama City on Monday. It would have
been his 87th birthday.

<HEAD>Attorney Accused of Introducing ``Sleaze'' Factor During Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys in a lawsuit over Liberace's
will accused each other of introducing sleaze into the trial
Wednesday as they delved into the private lives of the entertainer
and his associates.
   The exchange came as former Liberace valet and houseman George
Llinares of Palm Springs, Calif., recounted his years of service
with Liberace, who died Feb. 4, 1987, of complications of AIDS.
   Llinares at one point testified that housekeeper Dorothy McMahon
had a ``very close'' relationship with Cary James, Liberace's
companion the last six years of his life.
   James and Ms. McMahon are two of five plaintiffs in a lawsuit
that seeks to have Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer Joel Strote
removed as executor of Liberace's vast estate.
   Harold Gewerter, the attorney for the five, objected frequently
as defense lawyer John O'Reilly questioned Llinares about the
relationship between James, Ms. McMahon and Liberace.
   Llinares said Ms. McMahon used to ``cover up'' for James and
Scott Thorson, Liberace's former companion.
   ``When they went out, she would tell him they had gone shopping
or something,'' he said. ``I reminded her she should remember who
she worked for.''
   Llinares said Ms. McMahon and James were ``very close'' and
would ``lock themselves in a room for an hour.''
   Gewerter objected vigorously, saying the questioning was getting
``downright sleazy.''
   O'Reilly responded that he was simply following up on issues
raised when the plaintiffs presented their case earlier this summer.
   James and Ms. McMahon were visibly upset by the questioning and
the housekeeper walked down the hall sobbing loudly during a
morning break.
   Strote also appeared agitated during the session and left the
courtroom before the break.
   Angie Liberace, the sister of the late entertainer and one of
the plaintiffs, bowed her head and sobbed when Llinares claimed
that Liberace didn't want her around his house.
   At one point, state District Judge Michael Wendell lectured the
attorneys, saying, ``I'm interested in one thing _ should Joel
Strote be removed as executor. I'm not interested in personalities,
not interested in morals. We're getting far afield.''
   Under cross-examination, Llinares admitted he had written a book
about Liberace and was trying to find a publisher. He said he
worked for Liberace twice, from 1975 to 1977, and 1979 to 1984.
   Llinares said he quit Dec. 29, 1984 in a huff because he wanted
to go to France to see his family. He said the parting was bitter
and he told Liberace ``God will make you pay for that.''
   Llinares testified that Liberace referred to Strote as ``Mr.
Fixit'' because of his legal expertise and often said ``Thank God
for Joel Strote.''
   Plaintiffs in the case contend Liberace was too ill to
understand a new will and trust he signed 13 days before he died,
making Strote executor of his estate and head of the Liberace
Foundation for the Performing Arts.
   Those filing the suit contend that Strote has taken excessive
fees as head of the foundation. But testimony Tuesday indicated
that the assets of the Liberace estate had climbed from $14 million
to $18 million under his guidance.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas fighting the Marxist
government killed 21 people and injured 22 in a pre-dawn attack on
the town of Maragra, 45 miles north of Maputo, the national news
agency AIM reported Wednesday.
   It said about 300 guerrillas of the Mozambique National
Resistance attacked the town early Tuesday, burning huts, stealing
goods and shooting residents.
   The guerrillas have waged a hit-and-run insurgency against the
government since 1977, two years after Mozambique gained
independence from Portugal.
   Western diplomats and relief workers have supported government
allegations that the guerrillas are responsible for numerous
massacres and other atrocities.
   Mozambican rebels meanwhile claimed Wednesday to have killed 16
troops and six Tanzanian soldiers in attacks on five government
posts Monday in northeastern Cabo Delgado province.
   The Mozambique National Resistance said in a statement
distributed in Lisbon, Portugal, that it also destroyed in central
Manica province part of an important oil pipeline that runs from
Mozambique to neighboring Zimbabwe.
   It claimed it captured two military officers.
   No independent confirmation of the group's claim emerged.
   Troops from neighboring Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Malawi fight the
rebels in Mozambique, mainly to protect transportation and oil
routes.
   Augusto Pereira, 48, of Lisbon, said Wednesday in Maputo, the
Mozambican capital, that he escaped from a rebel camp after being
kidnapped from his wood business in Manica province June 29, the
LUSA news agency of Portugal reported.
   LUSA quoted Pereira as saying the rebels forced him to march
about 250 miles to a camp near the border with Zimbabwe.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian official met Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie in secret talks in London Wednesday to discuss
British hostages in Lebanon, the British domestic news agency Press
Association reported.
   The reported 75-minute meeting followed other recent contacts
between church officials and the Iranian government and signs of
improving relations between Britain and Iran. The 18 foreign
hostages in Lebanon are believed held by pro-Iranian groups.
   Press Association said Church of England officials arranged a
meeting with Mohamed Reza Said Mohamedi, an Iranian Foreign
Ministry official based in Tehran, at Lambeth Palace, Runcie's
official London residence. Runcie is spiritual leader of the Church
of England.
   The agency said no details about the meeting were disclosed, but
that it was believed the discussions included the fate of Runcie's
special envoy, Terry Waite; television journalist John McCarthy and
teacher Brian Keenan.
   Waite vanished in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the
release of American and other foreign hostages. No group claimed
responsibility for his disappearance.
   McCarthy was kidnapped on April 17, 1986.
   Keenan has been missing since April 11, 1986. Keenan from
Belfast, Northern Ireland, holds dual British and Irish
nationality, and the Irish government is also seeks his release.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for the Associated Press, who was taken captive March
16, 1985.
   John Lyttle, a senior adviser to Runcie, who was in Tehran in
June for talks with Iranian religious and government officials,
also attended Wednesday's meeting, the agency said. It said Lyttle
confirmed Mohamedi met with Runcie Wednesday but said Lyttle
declined to give details.
   On Monday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
announced it will send a British diplomat to Iran this week for the
first time in a year.

   United Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavez
persisted Wednesday for a 25th day of a water-only fast, the same
length of time he went without food in 1968 to gain recognition of
his union.
   The 61-year-old Chavez remained bedridden but in stable
condition Wednesday as he picked up support from two officials of
other unions representing nearly 3 million workers.
   Chavez says he is fasting to promote a consumer boycott of
California table grapes, whose growers refuse to sign union
contracts and use pesticides he says endanger field workers and
their families.
   ``Cesar has raised the ante. He has made us feel ashamed,'' said
Gerald McEntee, president of the 1 million-member American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. He promised to
urge members to hit the streets and support the four-year-old
boycott.
   ``Cesar Chavez in the minds of many of us represents the soul of
the American labor movement,'' said Jack Henning,
secretary-treasurer of the 1.9-million member California Labor
Federation.
   Henning acknowleged the boycott hasn't taken hold even in
California but said the public is beginning to realize the
sacrifice by Chavez and his message.
   ``The implementation of a boycott in the long term is not an
easy task. We have a renewal here through Cesar's fast,'' said
Henning.
   Hollywood stars and children of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
have traveled to Delano in recent weeks to publicize the boycott.
But these visits and the ensuing publicity have had a negligible
effect on California table grape sales, according to state
regulators and a California Grocers Association official.

   Iraqi troops are using poison gas in an
offensive against Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in
northeastern Iraq, Kurdish and Iranian sources said Tuesday.
   They said about 30,000 Iraqi soldiers are engaged in the
assaults that began July 30 to dislodge the Kurds from their
mountain strongholds.
   Iran, at war with Iraq for nearly eight years, has supported the
Kurdish rebels in Iraq. But Iran and Iraq agreed Monday to a
U.N.-mediated cease-fire that is to go into effect Aug. 20.
   Massoud Barzani, leader of the insurgent Kurdish Democratic
Party,, issued a statement Tuesday saying Iraqi troops using
chemical weapons and with air and artillery support advanced into
``liberated territory'' controlled by the rebels.
   The statement, received in Nicosia from the Kurdish Democratic
Party office in Greece, appealed to the United Nations to stop the
Iraqis ``particularly now that the Kurdish people are the target of
gas attacks and face planned extermination.''
   It said 63 civilians were seriously hurt in poison gas attacks
on three Kudish villages near the Turkish border. The statement
also claimed 1,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed, wounded or captured
in the offensive.
   A report by Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said Kurdish refugees were fleeing into Turkey and Iran.
It called on the Turkish and Iranian Red Crescent societies and the
International Red Cross to help them.
   The cease-fire accord calls for Iranian and Iraqi forces to
return to internationally recognized borders. The Kurdish rebels
said Iraq launched the new operations to drive Kurds out of the
border areas before U.N. peackeepers arrive to oversee the truce.
   Some 20 million Kurds live in sections of Turkey, Iran, Iraq,
the Soviet Union and Syria. There are an estimated 3.5 million
Iraqi Kurds, and the rebels have been fighting for autonomy for
more than 50 years.

interest rates higher, including those on home mortgages,
economists predict.
   The Fed announced Tuesday it was raising its discount rate to
6.5 percent from 6 percent, to help curb inflation and to account
for the recent rise of open-market interest rates.
   The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges on

most dramatic move the Fed can make in signaling its credit

won't be like a crop, but it's better than nothing.''
   The most expensive disaster relief measure ever enacted for
agriculture was approved by House on Tuesday after passing the
Senate the day before. The White House has said President Reagan
intends to sign the bill.

   The Environmental Protection Agency took steps
Wednesday to reduce levels of hazardous lead in the nation's
drinking water supplies by proposing that water be treated at tens
of thousands of plants.
   The proposed rules, which EPA officials said likely could
require about half the nation's water supply systems _ 53,000 _ to
treat water, could prove expensive for those served by small
systems. A few families could see their bills rise as much as $367
a year.
   Environmentalists had mixed reactions to the proposal. They
lauded the plan to treat water supplies, but said EPA's proposal
fails to ensure Americans will drink lead-free water. They also
said it could contribute to wasting precious water and places too
heavy a burden on the consumer.

   Iran's acting commander-in-chief, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said Wednesday a U.N. inquiry must condemn Iraq as the
aggressor in the Persian Gulf war or the region will face grave
consequences.
   Also on Wednesday, small groups of U.N. officials arrived in
Tehran and Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, to prepare for hundreds of
observers who will monitor a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire set for Aug.
20.
   Tehran Radio said Iraqi warplanes violated Iranian airspace in
the southwest, but no bombing was reported. Iraqi reports monitored
in Cyprus did not mention air activity.

   At the beginning of the summer, the 16
high school computer jocks were in awe of the $1 million
supercomputer like the one ETA Systems Inc. will award to one of
their schools Friday.
   But as their six-week competition doing research projects on the
ETA10-P winds up, some of the students admit they have become a
little blase.
   ``When we first got here, the supercomputer looked s-o-o-o big,
s-o-o-o wonderful, and it really is. Don't get me wrong,'' said
15-year-old Doreen Pettus, who will be a junior this fall at North

   A year ago, there was talk that Alan Greenspan
might become the George ``Twinkle Toes'' Selkirk of the U.S.
economy.
   Like Selkirk, the journeyman baseball player who took Babe
Ruth's place in the New York Yankees' starting lineup, Greenspan
succeeded a legend.
   How could this mild-mannered economist replace the towering Paul
Volcker, who as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board grew so large
in stature that he was often described as the second most powerful
man in America?
   In his first year as Fed chairman, Greenspan has done quite
well, thank you, according to the testimomy of members of Congress,
the Reagan administration and private economists.
   He's won friends in Congress by being more open and candid than
Volcker, who liked to cloak his answers at congressional hearings
behind a haze of cigar smoke and deliberately vague qualifiers.
   He has gained solid support inside the central bank by actively
seeking out the opinions of the other governors and the
professional staff, who had at times felt left out of
decisionmaking during Volcker's eight-year tenure.

   Thousands of seals are dying on North
Sea beaches and environmentalists say pollution is the killer, but
scientists are not ready to blame a ``toxic cocktail'' they are
finding in the carcasses.
   An estimated 7,000 diseased harbor seals have died since April,
about half the population in the North Sea waters of West Germany,
the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.
   West German television gives the death count nearly every night
and shows closeups of carcasses being loaded onto trucks to be
hauled away for disposal. More than 2,000 of the seals have died in
West German waters.

   The mayor of Edmonton, members of Parliament and

superstar to the United States, but it's a path pioneered by many
other Canadians from Mary Pickford to Michael J. Fox.
   The decision Tuesday by the Edmonton Oilers to trade Gretzky _
``The Great One'' _ to the Los Angeles Kings touched the most
sensitive nerve in this northern culture: the fear that Canada's
best and brightest inevitably end up in the United States.
   The expatriates include economist John Kenneth Galbraith and
anchorman Peter Jennings, but it's Hollywood that has brought the
most fame to Canadians such as Miss Pickford, Fox, Glenn Ford,
Raymond Burr, Lorne Greene, Raymond Massey, Ruby Keeler, Yvonne De
Carlo, Rich Little, John Candy and Margot Kidder.

   Marco Polo observed it 700 years ago.
Genteel Englishwomen were said to have fainted at the sight of it.
Today it is a $500 million-a-year business in India.
   It is the ancient custom of chewing ``paan,'' or betel pepper
leaf. It is the most visible Indian habit; millions across the
country relentlessly chew the conical-shaped leaf and spit out its
reddish residue.
   The paan leaf is wrapped betel nut, quicklime and a score of
other flavorings geared to individual tastes. Some are mildly
narcotic.
   The practice gives many Indian taxi drivers bright red grins,
leaves unsightly splotches on streets, sidewalks and other public
places, and sometimes upsets tourists when the stream of betel
juice comes too close.
   From the humblest hut to palaces of former maharajas, paan is
part of Indian life. Elegant hostesses serve coffee and cigars
after dinner, but reserve paan for the finale.
   ``No Indian meal is complete without a paan. It would be like
having dinner in Paris without wine,'' said B.K. Jha, a 66-year-old
journalist and paan connoisseur who has been chewing if for 50
years.
   ``Paan has become an essential accessory to the Indian life,
associated with leisure, valor, cuisine and ritual.''
   Indeed, paan is among the few things that seem to bind rather
than divide India, where adherents of the seven recognized
religions and speakers of the 16 official languages are often at
odds.
   For addicts, paan can be an all-day habit, but it is normally
taken after meals.
   In an Indian home after a rich meal, a guest is offered his or
her choice of ``sada'' (plain), ``mitha'' (sweet) and ``tamaku,''
which has a narcotic stimulant.
   Flavorings include camphor, cardamom, clove, coconut, cinnamon,
saffron, nutmeg, almond, melon seeds and aniseed. About 12
different types of stimulants or tobaccos can be added.
   A first-class paan can have a ``vark,'' a layer of beaten silver
or gold on the leaf that adds a touch of beauty and is chewed with
the other contents.
   Custom demands that you pop the full paan into your mouth and
spit the first juice out. Depending on the quality, it takes from
two minutes to half an hour to finish one paan.
   In homes, cuspidors are provided for guests, but since by custom
the cuspidor is ornamental, the first reddish gush is exuded on the
road outside.
   Om Prakash Lalwani runs India's best-known paan shop, the Prince
Paan Bhandar in Old Delhi. He took over from his father, who opened
the shop as a refugee from Pakistan in 1949. The shop now sells
paan to more than 5,000 people a day and has a staff of 50 who
travel across India to set up special stalls at marriages, birth
ceremonies and funerals.
   Paan is priced according to the contents and which of the 35
varieties of leaf is used. The most famous leaf is the ``benarsi,''
named for the Hindu holy city of Benares and said to be kept buried
for months to eliminate any raw taste.
   The cheapest paan at Lalwani's shop sells for 14 cents and the
deluxe beaten-gold variety for $1.75.
   Lalwani says he can wrap a paan to last up to 48 hours and has
customers who take them as gifts to friends in Europe and the
United States.
   In a more ordinary shop, paan can cost as little as 30 paise (2
cents).
   Altogether, paan cultivation, marketing and sales provide
employment to 5 million Indians.
   Now, too, there is packaged paan, which comes in foil envelopes
and is advertised in newspapers and magazines in much the same way
as cigarette ads elsewhere. The government issues warnings _ though
not on the package _ that paan can cause mouth cancer.
   It doesn't seem to stop Indians, however.
   Even some foreign visitors try it, a far cry from the days when
British gentlewomen were said to have fainted at the first sight of
a paan chewer, mistaking the red spittle for blood.
   It is not clear how and when paan came to India. Some say it was
brought in spice-laden boats from Southeast Asia in A.D 300. Betel
is chewed in other parts of Asia, but the ritual approach is
India's own.
   References to paan are found in Hindu scriptures.
   In the 13th century, the Venetian traveler Marco Polo visited
Kayal, now Madurai in southern India, and wrote: ``All the people
of this city as well as the rest of India, have a custom of
perpetually keeping in their mouth a certain leaf. ...''
   In the 18th century, an anonymous Sanskrit-language poet noted
that paan has 13 qualities ``unobtainable even in heaven.''
   That thought may be behind the practice in eastern India, where
a paan is placed in the mouth of the dead before the funeral pyre
is lighted so the departed soul can travel to heaven chewing.

<HEAD>Spanish Videocassettes Boom as Hispanic VCR Use Grows</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By FELIX GUTIERREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As more U.S. Hispanics add VCRs to their
televisions, they're being wooed by everything from Spanish
versions of American films like ``Missing In Action'' to
videocassettes on ``Amnesty Simplified.''
   ``Every month an average of 200 (Hispanic video) movies were
released'' last year, according to Lomberto Perez, publisher of
Miami's bilingual Video Vision magazine. ``Some were dubbed, some
were subtitled, some had original Spanish-language soundtracks.''
   With a lower median income than the national norm, Hispanics
were once seen as a poor market for technical gadgets. But about
half of U.S. Hispanic homes have VCRs, according to Strategy
Research Corporation. That approaches the national average of 56
percent.
   ``The Latinos rent more because we have larger families,'' said
Rafael Rivera of Condor Video, with a line of 300 Spanish-language
videos. ``To take the family to see a movie at $6 apiece you're
talking about $50 a night by the time they pay for the ticket and
buy popcorn.
   ``But if they can rent a few movies at a dollar or two apiece,
they can have their popcorn and entertainment at home,'' said
Rivera. He said Hispanics typically select tapes as a family, with
youngsters often preferring English-language cassettes, while
Spanish-language videos are favored by adults.
   These patterns, plus the fact that the Hispanic population is
increasing faster than the overall American population, are sending
video manufacturers, distributors and outlets scrambling to dub,
subtitle, produce, transfer, rent or sell videos targeted to
Hispanics.
   The ``golden opportunity'' for profits in the Hispanic video
market was discussed in a session on ``Hispanic Videos: Fiesta or
Siesta?'' at the recent Video Software Dealers Association
convention in Las Vegas. At last year's meeting the seminar was
titled ``Se Habla Dollars.''
   Hispanic tapes run the gamut from music videos starring Julio
Iglesias and other top Latin stars to Spanish versions of such
popular English-language movies as ``Ironweed'' and ``E.T.''
   Other titles include Spanish and English video flash cards to
help children learn math, ``Lucha Libre'' cassettes of wrestling
matches, and the ``Amnesty Simplified'' tape featuring step-by-step
instructions in English or Spanish for illegal residents seeking
amnesty ``without an attorney.''
   But most of the taped fare is movies, about 75 percent of them
from Spain or Latin America, Rivera said. U.S. releases dubbed or
subtitled in Spanish account for the rest.
   ``Generally the most popular movies are action, adventure and
comedy,'' said David Quintero, vice president of VideoVisa, a
Mexican-owned company selling videos in both countries. ``American
films with subtitles are the most popular in Mexico. In the United
States it's original Mexican productions.''
   VideoVisa has about 300 films, mostly Mexican movies, available
in the United States and hopes to build its stock to 750. Three to
seven films are released a month, usually a mix of action, romance,
comedy and terror to give ``a little of everything for the
public,'' Quintero said.
   With the new focus on VCRs owned by Hispanics, there's increased
competition to tie up U.S. rights to Spanish-language productions
and get them to the viewers.
   Video pirates have also discovered the Hispanic market and are
offering discount illegal copies of tapes in Spanish.
   ``The pirates on any given title are selling between 2,000 and
3,000 copies,'' said Condor's Rivera. He said the illegal copies,
sold by ``trunkers'' out of car trunks or through retail outlets,
are sold at $20 to $35 just before his tapes go on the market at
$50.
   ``If the Hispanic video market is doing $30 million to $40
million a year, they could double that without the piracy
problem,'' said Rivera. Added VideoVisa's Quintero, ``The market is
growing. Unfortunately, it's growing much more for the pirates than
for us.''

<HEAD>Graham Sees More Spiritual Notes In Political Conventions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   God usually gets some polite nods at American
political conventions, but an old-timer of the candidate-crowning
powwows says he detects a stronger religious element this time
around.
   ``There was more of a spiritual tone at the Democratic
Convention and I think we'll also see it at the Republical
Convention,'' says evangelist Billy Graham, a convention regular
since midcentury.
   As he has done at every Democratic and Republican national
convention over the last 36 years, Graham will be offering prayers
at next week's Republican affair as he did for the Democrats in
July.
   ``I never go to one without the other,'' he said in telephone
interview from Buffalo, N.Y., where he wound up a heavily attended
crusade last Sunday in that mostly Roman Catholic city.
   ``I always stay neutral politically, and I'm going to be neutral
this time,'' he said. I won't tell who I'm voting for, and I'm not
endorsing anybody. That's the reason I go to both conventions.''
   Graham, 69, a personal friend and unofficial chaplain to the
country's seven presidents since 1952, attributed the increased
spiritual note at the Democratic Convention to the influence of
black delegates.
   ``The black people made a great impression on white delegates as
dignified, highly educated and they love the Lord,'' he said.
``They came out of the churches. These black people made a
spiritual impact.''
   He said that unlike some past conventions, when delegates would
``walk around and talk'' during prayers, the crowd this time would
all stand ``and it would be so quiet you could hear a pin drop.''
   At one point, he said he watched a network television reporter
trying to question the Rev. Jesse Jackson on the floor during the
benediction, but Jackson deflected the reporter's questions,
saying, ``We're praying now.''
   Jackson bowed his head while African Methodist Episcopal Bishop
Frederick C. James led the benediction, refusing to continue the
interview until the prayer was finished, Graham said.
   While Jackson, the second-running Democratic candidate, gave a
rousing address in Gospel-preaching style to the Democrats, another
also-ran minister, Pat Robertson, was to address the Republicans.
   ``I'm happily surprised for clergymen to be addressing both
conventions,'' Graham said. ``It's healthy for there to be more
recognition of spiritual life whenever people gather.''
   At the Republican Convention, Graham is to lead a prayer Monday
night when President Reagan finishes his address, and will sit with
the George Bush family on the closing night when he gives his
acceptance speech.
   ``They're both long-time friends,'' Graham said, noting that he
had spent a dozen nights at the White House in Reagan's presidency,
and regularly spent part of his vacation in Maine with Bush.
   Besides leading prayers, Graham said he'd also be going to
various receptions at the convention, just as he did at the
Democratic Convention, including a luncheon for governors where he
sat with Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis.
   ``He was very warm and friendly,'' Graham said.
   At one reception given by veteran Democratic party leader Robert
Strauss, Graham said that as he was leaving Strauss followed him
into the hall and said, ``When you get ready to go to heaven, let
me know. I want to go with you.''
   Graham said that while avoiding partisan politics, he tries to
do as much for one party as the other, and he urges Christians to
become involved in the political process regardless of which
candidate or party they support.
   Of his just ended crusade in Buffalo, 70 percent Roman
Catholics, Graham said he had received ``wonderful support'' from
Catholics, as well as mainline Protestant bodies and black churches.
   ``People really came out in numbers,'' he said. ``More came
forward to receive Christ per capita than I've seen anywhere in
America.''
   He said the Buffalo crusade was part of a New York regional
drive, with campaigns over the next six months in Rochester,
Hamilton, Ontario; Syracuse, Long Island and Albany.
   Before his Buffalo crusade, Graham had been abroad for 16 weeks,
first with his wife, Ruth, in China where she was born, daughter of
a missionary doctor, and then in the Soviet Union for celebrations
of the 1,000th anniversary of Christianity in Russia.
   ``To see television filled with religion for 10 days stunned the
Soviet people,'' he said. ``It was the first time many of them
realized their roots were in Christianity.''

   A 5-year-old California native is the
best termite detector on the job and one of the best all-around
workers at a city pest extermination company, his boss says.
   Every morning, Darryll dons a red collar imprinted with the
words ``termite dog,'' while his handler pulls on a white lab coat.
Then man and beagle head for a house, factory or other building to
let Darryll have a sniff at the woodwork-crawling critters.
   Darryll got local attention in a rap-music commercial a few
months ago that featured puppets praising the dog's skills. And his
portrait graces the company's Yellow Pages advertisement.
   Darryll is leased from TADD Services of Belmont, Calif., for
$30,000 for two years, said Dave Pontes, general manager of New
England Pest Control. TADD stands for Termite Ant Detection Dog.
   TADD Services begins training puppies at 8 weeks old and sends
them to their first jobs when they are eight to 10 months old.
   TADD Services has 60-70 termite-sniffing dogs in the United
States, but ``our dog Darryll is the only dog in New England,''
Pontes said.
   So far, Darryll, who has been with New England Pest Control
nearly 4{ years, has never failed to detect a termite in a wood
boring inspection, Pontes said.
   ``When a human does an inspection, they're only guaranteed by
what they can see,'' Pontes said, and company officials are quick
to explain that to their customers.
   But with Darryll, ``We guarantee the house from the basement
right through the ceiling,'' Pontes said. ``He finds termites with
a sense of smell and hearing. I would say in the four years we have
had him, he's done 3,500 inspections.''
   Darryll's expertise does not come cheap. The company charges a
minimum of $125 per building. Customers pay a starting price of $70
per building for human inspectors, Pontes said.
   New England Pest Control has a $1 million errors-and-omissions
insurance policy for Darryll, as well as a $25,000 life insurance
policy, Pontes said.
   When Darryll is 8, Pontes said, he will be sent back to
California, deprogrammed, then returned to Rhode Island and given
to handler Clarence Cornell as a pet.
   Darryll currently stays with Cornell at his Coventry home, along
with Cornell's two Shetland ponies, three cats and another dog,
Pontes said.

<HEAD>Dough Boys _ Inmate Bakers at State Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buried in the prison landscape of concrete cell
blocks, watch towers and barbed wire fences is a building warmed by
the smell of a staple of life _ freshly baked bread.
   Welcome to the bakery at the state's Richard J. Donovan
Correctional Facility, where 50 inmates produce 1,500 loaves a day
of white and wheat bread to help feed the 2,821 prisoners.
   ``Don't tell them (prison officials) this, but I'd work for
free, just to pass the time,'' said inmate Mike Warner, who is
making 25 cents an hour as a lead ``dough man.'' He helps oversee
the initial creative stage, the mixing of the dough to make the
bread.
   ``I wanted to come in here and benefit myself more,'' said John
Briseno of Bakersfield, who works as a dough mixer. ``I can learn
more about being a baker so I can look for a baker's job when I get
out.''
   Briseno, who has 2{ years left to serve on a robbery conviction,
said the money he makes as a prison baker allows him to buy
``toothpaste, shampoo and cards to send to my mother.''
   Warner, convicted of attempted murder eight years ago, is
counting on his bakery and supervisory experience to help him set
up a business when he gets out of prison.
   ``My mom and I are planning to open a restaurant when I get out
in 28 months,'' said Warner, who is from San Diego.
   George Ford II of Los Angeles, who has served three months of a
three-year sentence for armed robbery, worked in the prison's
canteen and laundry before switching to the bakery when it went
into operation May 2.
   Ford, who works around the bakery's 43-foot-long oven making
sure the bread cooks properly and workers abide by safety rules,
said Tony Angelini, the civilian baker overseeing the inmates'
work, ``has been an inspiration to me. He's teaching me how to be
the best oven man there is.''
   The blending of yeast and flour still intrigues Ford, who said
he ``never knew the inner workings of bread.''
   ``I'm used to going to the supermarket, and there it was,'' he
said.
   The bakery is an operation of the Department of Corrections'
Prison Industry Authority, which still oversees the manufacture of
license plates using inmate labor but increasingly exposes
prisoners to varied occupations that they can use upon release.
   ``We can offer these men the skills that will make them a viable
part of society when they get out,'' said Mario Luque, a production
manager for the authority at the San Diego prison.
   Still, each inmate must make an individual commitment. ``It's
like leading a horse to water,'' Luque said.
   Products made by the authority are, by law, sold only to
tax-supported agencies. ``We don't compete with the public,'' Luque
said.
   But state, county and local governments save millions of dollars
each year by purchasing authority goods, said Carlos Chavez, the
authority administrator at the San Diego prison.
   The prison bakery, for instance, sells the bread to the state
for 46.5 cents a loaf, well under the going rate on the open
market. Officials plan to add a second shift of 50 inmate-bakers
and to expand production to 20,000 loaves a day, along with
hamburger and hotdog buns and rolls. The expanded bakery will
supply breads to four other state prisons, said Chavez.
   The prison authority is developing other enterprises at the San
Diego prison, which opened about a year ago _ from an optical
laboratory producing prescription and safety glasses to a textile
mill making inmate clothing.
   The authority's jobs are the most desirable to inmates because
they pay by the hour, giving prisoners a chance to make a little
more money than they would if they worked for the state in a
kitchen, prison fire department or yard clean-up job at a flat
monthly rate.
   ``Plus for each day they work here, they get a day off their
sentence,'' Angelini said.
   The authority, which employs 42 percent of the inmates
statewide, starts its workers at 25 cents an hour for a month-long
probationary period. The inmates work a minimum 30-hour week and
their pay can escalate in 5-cent increments to a maximum of 90
cents an hour.
   ``The pay and conditions are so good as compared to other
(prison) jobs that nobody wants to mess it up,'' Warner said, when
asked how the prison bakers got along with one another on the job.
   Chavez added: ``The Prison Industry Authority is designed to
eliminate idleness among inmates, to keep them working. In the
prison environment, idleness is your No. 1 concern.''

<HEAD>`Lump-Sum' Payments Can Be Hot Potatoes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When people receive a financial windfall, the
standard advice is simple: Put the money in some safe parking place
and take your time deciding what you want to do with it.
   That principle is sound, advisers on matters of personal finance
agree, in cases where you hit the lottery or receive an unexpected
inheritance.
   But it is less helpful on the much more common occasions when
people get what is known as ``lump-sum distributions'' from a
pension or profit-sharing plan.
   By law, you have just 60 days to decide whether to keep the
money, and pay taxes on the proceeds, or to stash it in a
``rollover'' individual retirement account.
   And that 60-day limit is ironclad. In a recent case, the
Internal Revenue Service said it couldn't make an exception for a
taxpayer whose check was written on time but not deposited because
of a clerical error at a bank.
   ``Taxpayers wishing to make tax-free IRA rollovers must be alert
and make certain that the 60-day rule is satisfied,'' observed the
accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells.
   Lump-sum distributions can occur in any one of several
circumstances: For example, if you retire, or leave one employer
where you are vested in the pension plan for another job.
   A distribution may also crop up through no act of your own
volition if, say, your employer is acquired by another company and
the organization being taken over terminates its retirement plan.
   For whatever reason, let's suppose you have a check for $50,000
coming. There are probably lots of uses you could think of for that
money right away. But you should bear in mind that you won't get to
keep all of it.
   As the investment firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton points out in a
recently published booklet on the subject, ``Your lump sum is
included in your ordinary income and subject to tax at your
ordinary income tax rates.
   ``Remember _ the amount of your distribution can push you into a
higher bracket.''
   Furthermore, if the distribution incurs a 10 percent penalty for
withdrawal before age 59{, as some retirement savings programs do,
you could wind up owing as much as $22,500 of the total to Uncle
Sam.
   There are ways to reduce the tax bill by using special rates
available to people who reached the age of 50 before Jan. 1, 1986,
the year a sweeping tax bill curtailed those benefits.
   If you plan to avail yourself of those special rates, you may
well want to consult a professional adviser. ``The rules on special
tax treatment get very complicated, and for every rule there's an
exception,'' Shearson says.
   People of any age can avoid current taxes by rolling the
distribution over into an individual retirement account within the
60-day limit.
   If you're relatively young, that means tying the money up. It
also, however, keeps your retirement planning intact.
   If you're 59{ years of age or older, you can tap the rollover
IRA whenever you want to, incurring taxes at ordinary income rates
only on the amount you withdraw.
   Unlike conventional IRAs, which limit annual contributions to
$2,000 per worker, a rollover IRA can be started with any amount.
Like conventional IRAs, rollover accounts offer the allure of
tax-free compounding of interest, dividends or capital gains.
   If you become aware of an impending lump-sum distribution,
financial advisers say, it makes sense to do as much planning as
possible in advance.
   If the check arrives on short notice, they add, there's no need
to panic, but you should start weighing your options without delay.

<HEAD>Popular Mood Swings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Get set to hear more and more about higher
prices, taxes and interest rates as the popular mood descends into
another of its blue funks.
   While sociologists know more about such phenomena than do
economists, even the most inexperienced observer can spot when a
mood change is about take place.
   The onset of a blue mood originates in bright times, and seems
to come almost as a consequence. It is an overreaction that seems
unable to stop itself until it goes to an extreme, whence a
brighter mood develops.
   The newest blue mood follows a short period of
self-congratulation, during which Americans praised the strength of
their economy, which not only shook off a big stock market crash
but showed unexpected strength.
   As moods brightened, stock forecasters raised their sights and
economists declared there'd be no recession this year. Fear of the
twin trade and budget deficits seemed to abate. People bought cars
and houses.
   The Federal Reserve's most recent lightning bolt, an increase of
the discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent, officially ended
the mood, and perhaps economic growth as well. But the clouds had
been forming for weeks.
   On Aug. 5, the Bureau of Labor statistics announced strong job
growth for July; immediately it was interpreted as an indicator of
inflationary pressures, the reasoning being that wages would rise
sharply in pursuit of fewer workers.
   Relatively unnoticed was a notation by Commissioner Janet
Norwood that job-market tightness could have been exaggerated by
methodology problem; or an earlier Conference Board message that
the labor market seemed to be loosening, ``good news for all those
still concerned about the economy overheating.''
   When the mood turns it does so sharply.
   Fortune magazine ran a cover story that advised the presidential
candidates to stop kidding the public about taxes, because
``everyody knows that for the deficit to come down, taxes must go
up.''
   Industry Week magazine matched it with a story on ``The Next Tax
Bite. Where, and How Big?'' It contends that ``like it or not,
analysts expect the next administration to implement new taxes.''
   Said the Ruff Times: ``Whether our next president is Michael
Dukakis or George Bush, you'll get higher taxes.''
   When the mood descends it spreads out, enveloping everything.
   After the Fed raised the discount rate, securities analysts
rushed out new, mainly negative views. Economists revised, mainly
downward, forecasts of the expansion's durability. Confidence fled.
Good news became bad.
   All reasons to expect the worst about inflation, taxes and
interest rates were exploited. The weather, for example, was
blamed; a newspaper story related that July heat hurt retailers _
beside a chart depicting July sales gains by top stores that ranged
from 2.7 percent (J.C. Penney & Co. Inc.) to 30 percent (Wal-Mart
Stores Inc.).
   ``There's no doubt in my mind; it's inevitable there will be tax
increases in 1989,'' a magazine quotes a businessman.
   Perhaps true, because that is the way of taxes throughout the
1980s: Tax increases precede and follow tax cuts.
   But is it really true that prices, interest rates and the
general economy are all headed for disaster?
   Or is that simply the latest mood?

   Biggest gains were reported in the Sunbelt and West Coast areas,
with a 50,000 increase in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose area,
and 30,000 increase in Florida.
   Of 15 states reporting a drop in Jewish population, New York,

   Anglican bishops have reversed a
century-old ban on baptizing polygamists in cultures where polygamy
is socially established. The new policy upholds monogamy as the
ideal and forbids converted polygamists from taking any more wives.
   The change was approved at the Anglican global Lambeth
Conference, which ended last weekend. Kenyan Bishop David Gitari
said it has been inconsistent to extend pastoral care to divorcees,
despite Jesus's strictures against divorce, yet not to tolerate
African polygamy, about which Jesus was silent.

<TEXT>
   They've used ``strategic block'' investing to
buy into corporate giants like Allegis and Gillette and amass a
hoard of cash instead of walking away with the companies themselves.
   But the three principals of Coniston Partners _ Paul Tierney
Jr., Augustus Oliver and Keith Gollust _ hardly fit the mold of
corporate raiders. Think of them more as refined persuaders _ with
the emphasis on persuasion.
   Unlike workaholic dealmakers, the Coniston partners take
three-day weekends, occasionally saunter about the office in jeans
and give money and time to a number of social causes.
   It could be their youthful appearances and their fresh sense of
pace that attracts people willing to invest $5 million each to join
their funds. More likely, however, it is the promise of a handsome
return, which has averaged in excess of 35 percent a year. Those
investors have helped the partners build a warchest estimated at
$700 million.
   Typically, the partners parlay that cash into big profits by
snapping up a large block of shares in an undervalued company and
pressing management to make changes that will boost the stock price.
   While that's not much different from the modus operandi of a
Carl Icahn or a T. Boone Pickens, the Coniston boys have added a
dash of soft soap to the business. Unlike Icahn, they aren't
interested in taking over their targets. They would rather cajole
from the outside and get managers to fix their own problems.
   They prefer ``sweet-talking'' to ``fist-pounding,'' said Donald
Carter, president of the Carter Organization, which has represented
Coniston in several boardroom battles.
   More than that, says Oliver, a 38-year-old lawyer formerly with
a prestigious New York firm, ``We approach things like the debate
over the future of a company with a certain amount of personal
integrity.''
   That's not to say the Coniston partners are anything less than
tenacious. Their latest contest, with razor-blade maker Gillette
Co., involved a bitter proxy battle that saw Coniston narrowly lose
a bid for four seats on Gillette's board. Subsequent legal
wrangling ended in a settlement under which Coniston agreed not to
increase its stake in Gillette or seek control of the company for
three years. Gillette, in turn, agreed to buy back 16 million
shares of its stock at $45 each.
   While Coniston should make about $44 million from that
investment, the profit came at a price. The partners had about $3
million in legal fees and never saw Gillette sold for the $50 a
share they believed it was worth.
   ``It wasn't a very satisfying end to the struggle,'' Tierney
admitted.
   The fight also shed a negative light on one of Coniston's most
prized investors, Tito Tettamanti, a Swiss businessman who leads
wealthy Europeans into the Coniston fold.
   Gillette characterized Tettamanti in full-page newspaper
advertisements as ``part of the tangled web of Coniston-related
foreign and domestic corporations and partnerships.''
   The Coniston partners rebuffed hints that Tettamanti figured in
their decision making, which has been the trio's sole purview since
Gollust teamed up with Tierney a decade ago. Oliver, whose light
brown mane hangs to his shoulders, joined in 1984, eager to escape
the law firm's constrained atmosphere and rigorous 50-hour work
week.
   Besides Gillette, their successes have included Storer
Communications, where Coniston made about $39 million in a 1985
leveraged buyout. The partnership also made a quick $60 million by
selling its 12 percent stake in Viacom International when the
company was acquired by National Amusements in 1987.
   Their best deal by far was their investment in Allegis, now
known as UAL Corp. With a 14 percent stake in the company, Coniston
pressed Allegis to sell its Westin and Hilton International hotel
operations and Hertz car rental business. Coniston cashed in most
of its stock at a profit of about $460 million when the company
bought back shares at $80 apiece.
   Despite the riches of their success, the Coniston partners
maintain modest offices overlooking fashionable Park Avenue. From
their fifth-floor vantage point, litter on the street is still
visible, and cab honking is quite audible.
   ``We attempt to corral the level of greed and realize money is
only one of the things you work for,'' said 45-year-old Tierney,
whose office is adorned with family photos of a recent African
safari.
   Investors in Coniston's various funds may be less altruistic.
Last year, the partners raised the minimum investment from $2
million to $5 million because ``the bulk of our investors were
interested and willing to invest more,'' Tierney said.
   Once clients decide to put their money with Coniston, that's the
last say they have in how it's used. As limited partners, investors
are told in no uncertain terms that they'll remain ``totally
passive,'' Tierney said.
   ``Investors know what they read in the paper, and they know what
their capital account is at the end of the year,'' said Gollust,
43. ``We've never had any complaints,'' he added with a smirk.
   Coniston's roughly 75 investors get no dividends _ the only
opportunity they have to take profits is when they leave the fund.
   Investors are assessed a ``management fee'' of 20 percent of
profits per year. Fortune magazine estimated last year that the fee
generated some $50 million in income for the partners, not counting
the substantial personal stake each has invested in the firm.
   The partners say their art comes in deciding collectively which
of a number of companies with similar financial profiles is the
right investment. While the odd man out has no allies, he does not
feel alienated.
   ``If I'm in the minority, I'm grateful I have two partners who
see things differently from me because I would have made a
mistake,'' Gollust said.
   The partners and the three investment professionals who work
with them meander in and out of each other's small offices freely,
discussing ideas that may have come to mind while windsurfing or
brainstorming.
   ``We do not want to build a large organization in terms of
people,'' Tierney said, partly because it might mean compromising
their relaxed work environment.
   Tierney says striking a comfortable balance between the spoils
of wealth and social concerns is a struggle. The former Peace Corps
volunteer has had a hand in local government, the PTA and sports
coaching, and lately has been mulling a contribution to the
presidential campaign of Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Oliver has pledged to pay college tuition for a class of 33
Hispanic teens, and he and his wife have taken the group to
baseball games, the theater, even to the Coniston offices.
   ``Each of us has a different sense of things we'd like to see
done in the world,'' said Oliver. ``Although making money is one,
none of us has the goal of being the richest person in the world.''

<HEAD>China Opens Corruption Reporting Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The phone has been ringing off the hook with
calls from ordinary citizens at the Embezzlement and Bribery
Reporting Center ever since it opened in the east district of
Beijing.
   The office is a sign of the times in China, as the government
tries to control corruption all over the country.
   ``The response of the people has been excellent,'' said a
frazzled Wu Yuhua, the 35-year-old station head, a week after the
center opened July 29. ``They are very curious and have many
complaints.''
   Housed in a cramped 19th century mud-and-mortar dwelling, capped
with the traditional sweeping eaves of a Chinese home, the center
is in a Beijing alley, next to a butcher shop.
   ``We wanted the people to be at home,'' Wu said. ``If we stuck
it on the fifth floor of a government building, no one would come
see us.''
   The station is manned six days a week for eight hours a day and
is equipped with a telephone answering service for after-hours
calls.
   In all, the station is responsible for about 6,000 government
employees serving 1.5 million people.
   All reports are taken in secret to protect the callers and all
investigations are handled by the reporting station.
   ``Too much corruption is investigated in China by the corrupt
bureau itself,'' said Wan Songching, the 50-year-old director of
the east district's investigative wing. ``But this reporting
station will do its own work. We are eager to see results.''
   Similar corruption reporting centers are opening all over the
country and the government says that by September every province
will one. In addition, a telephone corruption hotline opened in
Beijing in early August, ready to take calls from across the nation.
   Wu said such devices are necessary if China is going to reform
its government.
   ``In the past the government always policed itself,'' he
explained. ``Now we've got to have the support of the masses. We
can't clean up the government alone.''
   China has always tolerated a certain level of official
dishonesty. ``Guanxi,'' or connections, are the grease upon which
the wheels of society run. But lately corruption has been getting
out of hand.
   ``I am shocked at the change in my country,'' said Wang Poming,
who returned in July after eight years in the United States.
``Corruption is everywhere. School teachers force their students to
buy breakfast from them to make more money. Students steal tests
and sell them for a profit.''
   ``Corruption and inflation, that's all we Chinese are talking
about,'' said Liu Yuanshang, a bookstore owner in Beijing. ``We are
worried that all the dirt will stop the reforms.''
   The reforms, pushed for the last decade by national leader Deng
Xiaoping, have helped to double China's gross national product in
five years to $295 billion in 1987.
   But, by creating a two-track pricing system of low state-set
prices and higher free market prices, the reforms have created vast
opportunities for illegal deals.
   In late July, 75 state-run businesses in the industrial city of
Wuhan were exposed for making illegal profits off peasants. The
firms bought state goods at fixed low prices and sold them to
farmers at large profits.
   The reselling scheme has become so bad in the cigarette and
liquor market that on July 28 the government raised the price of
China's best brands by as much as 790 percent.
   The official press said the move was made to crush a black
market that has gained a monopoly on high-quality cigarettes and
spirit sales.
   In battling corruption, the government's policies have been
unclear _ lax in one city, harsh in the next and creative somewhere
else.
   In Shenyang, a northern city, the city government recently
imposed a tax on banquets, cars and firecrackers, three items that
officials often use public funds to buy.
   In Beijing, Qiao Yonghang, 35, who had been working for several
years at the state-owned Beijing Communications and Electrical Co.,
was executed July 25 for taking bribes in exchange for color
television sets, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   In all, he received bribes worth 120,000 yuan ($32,400), which
amounts to 125 years of the average urban salary.
   Still, because of ``guanxi,'' a great percentage of official
corruption continues.
   China's leading paper, the People's Daily (Renmin Ribao),
recently told of Gu Chengju, a forestry official in Hunan province
who stole 300,000 yuan ($81,000) in state funds to build an office
building and a high-class guest house.
   Almost two years after his case was exposed, Gu has yet to be
brought to justice.
   The reason is that Gu has been greasing the hands of local
officials who were supposed to investigate him, the paper said.
   ``This feudalistic practice of officials shielding one another
must end,'' it said in a strong editorial.
   Some Western analysts, notably Tony Kane, a China expert with
the Asia Society in New York, view the growing corruption as a sign
that China is becoming more democratic.
   ``During the Cultural Revolution the dirt and sleaze was just as
widespread but it was being perpetrated by only a few
individuals,'' Kane said. ``Now, at least, you have a situation
where more people are being allowed to participate. That is not
necessarily bad.''
   Wu Yuhuan and his colleagues at the Embezzlement and Bribery
Reporting Station in east Beijing do not agree.
   ``When a rat crosses the street the people run to beat it,'' Wu
said, citing a popular proverb. ``To me, corruption is the rat and
I must kill it.''

<HEAD>Bruce Lee's Successor Refuses to Be Another Rambo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CINTY LI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jackie Chan, the successor to the legendary
chop and drop king Bruce Lee as Asia's top action film star, has
yet to crack the American market but insists he has more to offer
than Sylvester ``Rambo'' Stallone.
   ``I think I am far better than him _ I dare say it straight to
his face _ because I can do things he can, but he can't do things I
can,'' the baby-faced Chan boasted in a recent interview.
   Chan, 34, is famous throughout Asia for the death-defying stunts
liberally sprinkled throughout his movies, and he pooh-poohs the
``Rambo'' series because Stallone doesn't attempt such exploits.
   ``We see the cave explode and then there he is, appearing on top
of another hill. Really, Rambo,'' he said.
   ``I only do what I really can, something an ordinary man cannot
do but a trained man can. This is me,'' Chan said, proudly tapping
his chest.
   In the 1987 film ``Project A II,'' Chan jumped from a 50-foot
clock tower to the concrete ground through two flimsy canvases. It
was a typical example of his work.
   Such stunts, however, don't come without bruises. In July, he
knocked himself out during a scene in which he somersaulted on top
of a moving bus before smashing through a billboard.
   The combination of stunts and humor in Chan's movies have made
him a smash, so to speak, box-office success in Asia, with his last
10 movies earning more than $150 million in Japan, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.
   When he appeared for a promotion in Tokyo in March, 800 fans
turned up, and he topped a list of idols in a survey of Taiwan
teen-agers released in February.
   In 1987, a Japanese woman named Reiko Mimura moved to Hong Kong
to serve him tea in his studio every day. Chan made her his floor
manager, a move that drove dozens more Japanese women to fly to the
British colony.
   The 24-year-old Mimura moved here from Tokyo in 1984 to be
closer to her idol. ``I just looked at him and felt very nervous.
He was nice and gave me his records with his autograph,'' she
recalled of a meeting two years ago.
   Chan, a muscular 5-foot-10, said he does not dare have a lover
or a wife for fear of driving his fans to despair. Two girls
reportedly tried to kill themselves over the actor.
   Despite his wild popularity in Asia, his efforts to impress U.S.
moviegoers have been disappointing. He has appeared in five
American movies, including ``Battle Creek Brawl'' and ``The
Cannonball Run.''
   Chan was not happy with the movies, and said he would like to do
a film with Steven Spielberg _ free of charge if necessary.
   ``I need an opportunity _ a great director who wants to make a
movie about Chinese people to hire me,'' Chan said. ``The audience
will want to see any film by that director, and when they happen to
see me in the movie they'll say, `Hey, this Jackie is cool.'''
   With no offers from Spielberg, however, Chan plans to star in a
self-directed movie in the United States next year. ``If the
Americans like it, OK. If not, forget it,'' he said.
   Chan was born in Hong Kong in 1954 to parents who emigrated to
Australia six years later. They enrolled Chan in the Chinese Opera
Research Institute to study acting, acrobatics and martial arts. He
appeared in a few films before leaving the institute to work as a
stuntman.
   After kung fu star Bruce Lee's death in 1974, director Lo Wei
picked Chan as a new talent. Chan's career was launched in the 1976
film ``New Fist of Fury'' in which he imitated Lee. More than 10
similar films quickly followed, but not until the 1978 ``Drunken
Monkey in a Tiger's Eye'' did Chan find his own style of
action-comedy.
   In 1985, Chan cracked his skull in Yugoslavia while shooting a
scene in which he was to leap from a castle onto a tree. Instead,
he fell 50 feet to the ground, fracturing his skull and driving a
splinter into his brain. Chan underwent brain surgery and hearing
in his right ear remains impaired.
   ``I never thought it would happen to me,'' he said. ``While I
was lying in the hospital I thought a lot and found there are many
things I have not done.'' The accident was a turning point in his
life. When he returned to Hong Kong, he set up a charity
foundation, participated in anti-drug campaigns and ran marathons
for charity.
   ``Now I think more positively,'' he said. ``If I want to do
something, I'll do it quickly. It's not that I'm afraid I may not
live through tomorrow, but I don't want to have any regrets.''

<HEAD>Olds Ciera Remains A Top-Selling Nameplate</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, which made its
debut in 1982, has become the best seller at Oldsmobile and a
top-selling nameplate in the auto industry.
   After testing a 1988 Cutlass Ciera International Series coupe,
it's easy to see why.
   Nothing was surprising about the car. Inside and out, everything
was where you'd expect to find it, and the Ciera went about its
business with predictable ease.
   It didn't seem to matter what the business was. Oldsmobile
reports the Ciera has a higher percentage than normal of buyers who
have single-car households (52 percent).
   Thus, the Ciera is expected to do a lot of things _ get around
town, haul luggage, whatever, said Mary Munkacsy, product liaison
at Oldsmobile for the Cutlass Ciera. A majority of the primary
drivers of Cieras are women, although only 38 percent of the
purchasers are female, she added.
   The average buyer, according to 1987 sales data, has an average
age of 53 and annual income of $44,000. Thirty-five percent are
college graduates and 23 percent are single, Munkacsy said.
   Sales of the Ciera topped 264,800 in the 1987 model year, making
it the sixth best-selling nameplate in the industry that year. It
also became the best-selling Oldsmobile nameplate in 1985, topping
the Cutlass Supreme.
   Through June of this model year, Ciera sales were 165,800, down
about 14 percent from year-ago sales, largely due to increased
competition in the mid-size market.
   But the Ciera still has a respectable record _ it continues to
be the top seller at Oldsmobile. It also shares its body
underpinnings _ A-car design _ with other General Motors Corp. cars
and ranks second, after its sibling Chevrolet Celebrity A-car, in
A-car sales at the giant automaker, Munkacsy said.
   The Celebrity, by the way, was the fourth best-seller in the
industry in 1987.
   Ciera's prices put it about in the range of its competitors.
   At $15,957 out the door, the test car compared to the $16,350
for a 1988 Taurus with 3.8-liter V6 engine and other similar
features. Oldsmobile lists the Toyota Camry as another competitor.
A 1988 Camry with a 2.5-liter V6 engine and equipped like the Ciera
was $15,700. However, there are lower-priced Cieras, including a
bare one at around $11,000 without the V6 engine.
   The International Series coupe and sedan add a new name to the
Ciera line for 1988. Munkacsy said they are designed for younger
buyers who want an expressive and fun car.
   The test car was expressive all right. It had ribbed pieces of
fabric in the middle of the seats and there was more of the ribbed
look on the sides of the doors inside. If you sat in the back seat,
you looked at zippers smack down the middle back of the front seats
plus a number of seams. I could do without all that.
   Legroom in the rear also could be cramped if a front seat was
pushed back and reclined somewhat.
   The suspension was OK, not real firm and certainly not punishing
as in some sporty cars. The trunk was spacious, though items must
be lifted over the rear part of the body of the car.
   Consumer Reports said 1982-86 Cutlass Cieras with six-cylinder
engines rated worse than average or much worse than average in
their trouble index with owners. Many problems were listed as
engine mechanical.
   Munkacsy said there have been a number of engines in the Cieras
over the years and noted a new V6 will be standard in the
International Series in the upcoming 1989 model year and optional
in some other Cieras. She added that in GM surveys the Ciera and
other A-cars have looked very good in having low incidents per car.
   Nonetheless, the company this summer mailed incentive offers to
buyers of 1985-odel Cieras who had expressed displeasure with their
vehicles in surveys by Oldsmobile. Those who took the time to
respond and complain are being offered $1,500 off or an extended
warranty when they buy a new Ciera.
   GM noted that after about three years many owners begin to think
about a new car and the company did not want those buyers to go
elsewhere because of a bad experience with their Ciera.

<HEAD>Bush's Epic Ride: The White House on Track 29</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He has led a life of almost fictional
proportions, a character out of F. Scott Fitzgerald's reveries
about the Eastern, moneyed elite, a man of drive, ability and charm
who moves, methodically, from mountain to mountain simply because
they are there to climb.
   George Herbert Walker Bush, scion of the late Connecticut
senator and New York financier Prescott Bush _ yes, born to the
silvery privilege so ridiculed by the opposition in Atlanta last
month _ obediently learned to compete early in life and hasn't quit
yet.
   As a child, he played hard in the home on Grove Lane in
Greenwich, Conn. _ no numbered address, people just called it the
Bush house _ matching wit and muscle against family members at
golf, tennis, tiddlywinks, backgammon, bridge, anagrams, anything
that pitted one against another. Then to Yale and war, where he
fought valiantly on the playing fields of Old Blue and in the skies
of the Pacific.
   Next, bride Barbara at his side, he headed westward, in a shiny
1947 Studebaker, to plumb the Texas oil fields and a feverish
business career where he gambled old money to win new. And then
chucked it all _ he's worth a modest $2 million today _ for a
fitful political climb in which he still courts the North with the
noblesse oblige of the Connecticut gentry and serenades the South
with a country tune as rough and dusty as West Texas sagebrush.
   Just days before he trampled his Republican rivals on Super
Tuesday this year, George Bush, 64, sat by a crackling fire in his
vice presidential office and offered this prescription for winning
his ultimate political quest: ``Be what you are in life. Don't try
to be everythng just because you're running for president.''
   Simple and sound enough advice for Bush, who has sometimes
exhibited hesitance but always forged ahead, uprooting wife and
children 28 times in 40 years. A 29th house, the white one on
Pennsylvania Avenue, may be the crowning stop of the Bush odyssey,
but he already has settled on his proudest accomplishment: ``The
fact that our children still come home.''
   It has been a trek from president of his prep school class at
Andover, Mass., like Dad, to captain of the Yale baseball team,
like Dad, to member of the super-secret Skull and Bones society,
like Dad, to millionaire, like Dad, to member of Congress, like
Dad, to _ unlike Dad _ two ambassadorships, chairman of the
Republican Party, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, vice
president for two terms, and now his party's standard-bearer in a
new campaign for the White House.
   But therein lies a problem. For all that George Bush has been,
many people seem uncertain about what he is. As one television
wisecracker put it, ``There is no there there.''
   Who is the real George Bush? In many respects he is what Ronald
Reagan played in the movies.
   Bush was a star collegiate athlete and a daring fighter pilot in
the Pacific, roles that Reagan knew only on the back lots in
Hollywood. He has been married to the same woman for 42 years and
has five children who are devoted to him; Reagan has an ex-wife and
children he rarely sees. Bush regularly attends church, Reagan
seldom does.
   Bush built the Republican Party in Texas, helped save the
national GOP, as its chairman, from being torn apart by Watergate,
and has loyally answered every party call; Reagan began his
political career as a Democrat.
   Yet, it is Reagan whose name is synonymous with Republican
loyalty, with God, family and country, with competitive spirit.
Bush, for his trouble, has been reviled by critics right and left
as a wimp, a lap dog, a preppy, a whiny, waffling boot-licker, a
target of scorn by Carson and Letterman, an invisible Doonesbury
character whose political manhood has been placed in a blind trust.
   Bush bridles at this criticism. To offset it, he sometimes talks
tough, as in a speech in New York City where he blasted ``every
two-bit punk with a knife who mugs a cleaning lady.''
   Several of these efforts have been downright clumsy, as in his
assertion to New Jersey dockworkers four years ago that he had
``kicked a little ass'' in his debate with vice presidential
challenger Geraldine Ferraro.
   But then, to the dismay of his aides, he will talk off-handedly
about his people attending ``coming-out parties'' or preface a trip
to the parched Midwest with a chipper ``Off to the drought!''
   The preppy charge may bother him most, and he has gone to some
lengths to explain that he hasn't worn a button-down Oxford shirt
in 20 years and his suits aren't Brooks Brothers but Arthur Adler,
and no, those aren't Gucci shoes, and he actually jogs more than he
plays tennis.
   At a pre-convention rally for ethnic groups, Bush acknowledged
he is ``a nice WASP'' but said his values match their own. Bush's
critics don't question his innate decency within his own set of
values but challenge whether he ever can understand what it is like
to be poor and oppressed and desperate.
   In his autobiography, Bush says that when he was ambassador to
China, he spurned diplomatic formalities and bicycled around
Beijing to get to know and understand its people.
   Historian Barbara Tuchman tells a story with a different view.
She and Bush appeared at a forum sponsored by a church in
Connecticut, some months after Bush had returned from China.
According to Mrs. Tuchman, somebody asked Bush if he'd had a chance
to meet any ordinary Chinese, and Bush replied: ``Oh, yes. They
gave us a boy to play tennis with.''
   To combat the ``w'' word, Bush has talked up his war record,
when he logged 1,228 hours of flying time and 126 carrier landings,
crashed on takeoff once, got shot down another time, flew 58 combat
missions and won the Distingushed Flying Cross. And he has written
poignantly about the death of his daughter, Robin, at age 3 after a
tortuous bout with leukemia.
   But nobody has questioned Bush's physical courage, or even his
emotional trials or toughness, a point he seems to miss. The doubts
are over his intellectual independence.
   In 1980, candidate Bush favored the Equal Rights Amendment,
opposed an amendment to ban abortions, derided Reagan ``as far to
the right as you can get.'' But since the moment of Reagan's
midnight call in Detroit, he has toed the Reagan line and has
reached to sometimes bizarre lengths to court the right wing.
   Two years ago, he jangled conservative nerves when he joined
civil rights leaders for an emotional tribute to the slain Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and
sang ``We Shall Overcome'' with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the South
African anti-apartheid leader.
   Three days later, he rallied with the New York State
Conservative Party and the day after that appeared before the
Liberty Federation to praise its founder, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a
man who had branded Tutu a fraud.
   Bush perplexingly turned out, in December 1985, at a testimonial
for the late William Loeb, the staunchly right-wing New Hampshire
publisher who had called Bush ``an incompetent liberal ... a
hypocrite ... a spoon-fed little rich kid.''

   But changes of heart did not come to Bush solely in the Reagan
era. Going back to his early political days in Texas, he has often
seen the light of the times. He opposed civil rights legislation,
then favored it. He backed the Vietnam War, even called for the
``restricted use of nuclear weapons if militarily prudent,'' then
wanted Americans withdrawn from Southeast Asia.
   Hardly a weekend television interview show goes by without
somebody carping that Bush has yet to demonstrate his own ``vision
of America,'' that he should unveil his own ``positive'' campaign
rather than relying on the Reagan program to carry him to the White
House.
   ``He has spent a lifetime thinking in conventional terms, never
reaching beyond them, never even wanting to,'' said Thomas ``Lud''
Ashley, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio but one of Bush's
closest friends for 40 years.
   Other Bush associates agree. Eddie Mahe Jr., who was political
director of the Republican National Committee when Bush was its
chairman, puts it bluntly: ``He's not a deep person. ... He doesn't
have the courage of his convictions.''
   Bush has always favored team play; baseball was his best sport,
and even in his business ventures he took in partners. He does not
enjoy a good argument, and, by many accounts, has rarely spoken out
in Cabinet meetings or National Security Council sessions, although
Bush himself says he communicates his ideas to the president in
their private, weekly Mexican-food lunches.
   But if he has seriously taken issue with the Reagan White House,
it remains locked in his heart. ``There are just many examples in
my mind that I'm not gonna share with you, where I know I've shaped
what happens,'' he said earlier this year. ``You can't point to
three things, I take that on the chin, because it's offset by the
fact that I know I've been loyal.''
   Even after the re-election campaign in 1984, when Reagan was
into a lame-duck term and Bush might have been expected to step
into the foreground, he remained quiet at White House staff
meetings. In early 1985, he rejected David Stockman's pleas for
help in persuading the president to cut the deficit. A year later,
he spurned appeals from several leading Republicans to intervene
with the president to dismiss Donald T. Regan as chief of staff.
   But the most nagging of the ``Where was George?'' questions
relates to the Iran-Contra debacle, an issue the vice president has
yet to address in specific, consistent terms. He has variously
claimed that he was ``out of the loop'' of the decisions that led
to the scandal, that he was ``deliberately excluded'' from key
meetings, and that he was completely unaware of the diversion of
funds from the arms sale to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   In its 690-page report on the scandal, Congress mentioned Bush
only briefly, saying it found no evidence he knew of the fund
diversion. As for the arms sales themselves, the report said, ``The
vice president attended several meetings on the Iran initiative,
but none of the participants could recall his views.''
   Bush did miss one key meeting, on Dec. 7, 1985, at which
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar W.
Weinberger vigorously opposed the arms sale. ``I was off at the
Army-Navy game,'' Bush said.
   Some see Bush's reluctance to step forward and speak out as part
and parcel of a political style geared more to getting along than
pulling along.
   Psychoanalyst Ray Walker, Bush's cousin, says, ``There is a
Christian innocence to George. His life has been without moral
ambiguity. He feels he has been granted goodness and that his
success proves the goodness was warranted.
   ``But this has all come to him without introspection, without
any grappling about right or wrong. George plays it safe. ... He
plays for the status quo.''
   With Bush, politics is personal, a contest to make friends, not
waves. He is a fanatic about writing personal notes to people along
the campaign trail. On the stump, he sometimes goes overboard to
buddy up to people. ``Hey, my main man!'' he says, with the
Connecticut roll of his vowels, to a high school student in Ames,
Iowa.
   And he tailors more than street cliches to his audiences. He
does, contrary to his self-advice, project different images to
different people, endearing himself, perhaps, to the local crowd
but exacerbating the ``wimp factor'' in the process.
   After Bob Dole drubbed him in Iowa, Bush ditched his imperial
style and surfaced in New Hampshire as one of the boys, offering to
help residents whose cars had stalled, shaking hands at factory
gates, tossing snowballs. ``I'm one of you,'' he said. ``I was born
in Massachusetts, grew up in Connecticut ... and have a home across
the way in Maine.''
   In Texas, his story is that his heart is there, too, since, as a
young man, he left the East and took a low-paying job with the
Ideco Corp. to learn the oil business and went on to ``strike out
on my own in the oil fields and build a business.''
   He doesn't dwell on the fact that the job was arranged by his
father, who was a friend of Ideco's chairman of the board, and that
his passage from the Skull and Bones club at Yale to the Petroleum
Club in Houston was helped with an $800,000 stake from relatives
and friends back East.
   Even while abroad, Bush's attempt to please the immediate
audience didn't play all that well elsewhere, like his own country.
After visiting Warsaw Pact forces in Eastern Europe last fall, he
effusively told his hosts that when the Russian tank mechanics
``run out of work in the Soviet Union, send them to Detroit,
because we could use that kind of ability.'' Auto workers were not
amused.
   Some see Bush's proclivity to make friends, to fit in, to be
``one of you,'' not as a flaw but rather as the heart of his
character. They see his empathy with people as the glue of his
success and point out that a major part of the art of being
president is compromise.
   Bush himself acknowledges, his Phi Beta Kappa key at Yale
notwithstanding, that ``I'm no intellectual.'' According to
Nicholas Brady, one of Bush's most trusted confidants, ``He's not
an ideologue in any sense. His philosophy centers around what's
fair and what's appropriate and a right sense of proportion.''
   There is some evidence to suggest that Bush can be effective
without stirring anybody's soul. He held the CIA together at a time
when it was under severe congressional attack for domestic privacy
violations in prior years. Others point out that he kept the GOP's
finances and organization together when Watergate threatened to
shatter the national party.
   Still, his cousin Walker says, ``He always placated his father,
then, later on, he placated his bosses. If you have a history of
deferring to somebody up the line, of saying `I'm not really free
to have my own moral position,' that's not going to change when you
become president.''
   Bush doesn't accept that a bit. ``I know who I am. I know
exactly where I want to go, how to take this country there,'' he
has said.
   But leadership ``isn't just making decisions and giving orders.
It's hearing all points of view before making the decision. That's
the way leadership works in a free society, by keeping open doors
and open minds.''

<HEAD>Republican Confab: Overwhelmingly White and Male</HEAD>
<HEAD>Convention '88</HEAD>

   When George Bush steps to the microphone to
accept the Republican presidential nomination this week, he will
gaze out over a convention floor populated overwhelmingly with
white, college-educated men.
   An Associated Press survey of 1,274 of the delegates to the
Republican National Convention found that 83 percent went to
college, 66 percent are men and 92 percent are white.
   By contrast, 52 percent of the delegates to last month's
Democratic National Convention were men and 68 percent were white.
   Republican delegates do show great diversity in their
occupations, ranging from an Amway distributor to the president of
that corporation. Other professions represented include lawyers, by
far the largest single group, teachers, scientists and sales
representatives.
   Three percent of the Republican delegates are members of labor
unions, compared with more than 20 percent of the Democratic
delegates.
   About 26 percent of the Republican delegates hold elected
offices, roughly the same as the percentage of professional
politicians among the delegates to the Democratic convention.
   The average age of a Republican delegate is 49, two years older
than the average age of a Democratic delegate, according to the AP
survey.
   The lack of ethnic diversity at the convention brought a mild
protest from Arizona Hispanics, who complained that none of them
were represented in the state's 32-member delegation.
   Overall, about 3 percent of the delegates to the Republican
National Convention are Hispanic, 3 percent are black, and 2
percent are American Indian, Asian or other minorities, according
to the AP survey.
   ``The polls said at this point that we're behind with women and
minorities, so let's try to do something to even that up,'' Joseph
A. Castillo, a former state senator and chairman of the Arizona
Republican Hispanic Committee, told party leaders.
   Castillo filed a challenge to the Arizona delegation so he could
tell the national party what he thought was wrong with the way
delegates were picked with respect to minorities.
   ``The Arizona delegation is sadly lacking in that respect,''
Castillo said.
   Castillo said he submitted the names of 11 people to the Bush
campaign in Arizona to be considered as candidates for delegates to
the national convention. One was picked as a delegate candidate _
Castillo himself _ but he was not elected.
   Arizona GOP Chairman Burton Kruglick said he supported bringing
minorities into the party, but he said they have to earn their
place by working to elect Republicans.
   ``I think the minority communities of our state have to do a
better job of involving their people,'' Kruglick told the party's
Committee on Contests last week. ``You can't just go out and
annoint somebody because they're a minority.''

   Some remember with flowers on a grassy rise by an
interstate highway overpass. Others remember with prayers for the
156 people lost in the crash of Northwest Airlines Flight 255.
   Around the country, a year after the plane plowed into
Middlebelt Road on a drizzly Sunday evening, many remember the
cherubic face of little Cecelia Cichan.
   Cecelia, then 4 years old, was the only passenger to survive the
Aug. 16, 1987, crash. Her mother, father and brother were among the
victims. She lives with an aunt and uncle in Birmingham, Ala., who
have a legal agreement to protect Cecelia in hopes she can lead as
normal a life as possible. They turn down interview requests.
   But other people _ relatives, rescuers and investigators _ have
found that talking about the tragedy helps.
   Less than a minute after the elongated twin-engine DC-9's front
wheels left Runway 3-Center at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, bound
for Phoenix, Ariz., one wing clipped a parking lot light pole 41
feet high.
   As the jet banked toward a car rental agency, part of the other
wing was sheared off. A subsequent investigation determined the
pilots had failed to extend the plane's wing flaps to provide lift
on takeoff.
   Flight 255 slammed into a four-lane road and broke apart as it
skidded under railroad and Interstate 94 overpasses, killing two
people on the ground and everyone aboard except Cecelia, shielded
from catastrophe by a woman's body.
   The toll made it the nation's second-deadliest air disaster: The
crash of an American Airlines DC-10 in Chicago on May 25, 1979,
Chicago killed 275 people.
   Broken bodies and burning chunks of the Northwest wreckage were
strewn for thousands of feet along Middlebelt Road and on the
Detroit-Chicago interstate.
   Lawrence Favio, an airport baggage handler, was driving home for
a dinner break at 8:46 p.m. when a sheet of flaming metal smashed
into his Thunderbird. Weeks later, he and Cecelia met at burn unit
in the University of Michigan Medical Center.
   Today, he remembers the crash every time he looks at the
mummy-like wrappings that cover his hands and extend to his elbows.
   Betty Polec of Mount Clemens remembers, too. Her daughter and
son-in-law were among the victims.
   In December, Polec and others held the first meeting of ``Flight
255: Their Spirit Lives On,'' a support group with about 85 members.
   ``The people who have joined the group, we have formed a
bond...,'' she said. ``We've worn each other's shoes.''
   Other relatives of victims needed to deal with the crash in
different ways.
   ``I've had some people tell me on the telephone, `I don't want
anything to do with this group. Just remember my loved one,'''
Polec said. ``And we do.''
   On Tuesday's anniversary of the crash, Polec's group plans a
vigil on Middlebelt Road, where flowers have been placed since the
plane went down. A light will be lit as each of the victims' names
is read, Polec said.
   Law officers remember, too.
   Some have sought psychological help. Three percent to 7 percent
have developed significant post-traumatic disorders, said
psychologist Kenneth Wolf, who counseled rescuers on the night of
the crash.
   ``Some deputies today still don't want to drive down Middlebelt
because it brings back many memories of the night of the crash,''
Wolf said.
   Other deputies are looking for a man with a gray beard who
showed up the day after the crash and began consoling victims'
families, claiming to be a Roman Catholic priest, ``Father John
Irish.''
   Some families became suspicious when he referred them to a
Florida attorney, but by that time Irish had vanished. An arrest
warrant alleged he defrauded Northwest out of motel and meal costs,
and Wayne County Sheriff Robert Ficano said Irish was suspected of
similar activity at other tragedies.
   But many others tried to brighten the lives darkened by
disaster. For the 68 days Cecelia was in the Ann Arbor hospital,
Americans opened their hearts and pocketbooks. Spokesman Michael
Harrison said the hospital received $157,420 in cash and checks,
all deposited in a trust fund, more than 30,000 cards and letters
and 2,200 gifts, mostly stuffed animals.
   Cecelia's family gave most of the gifts to children's hospitals
in Michigan, Phoenix and the Philadelphia area, where Cecelia's
grandparents live, Harrison said.
   The pain and suffering has also been relived in a federal
courtroom and a motel conference room.
   Attorneys from at least four states have filed 105 lawsuits
naming Northwest. For pre-trial purposes, all the suits have been
consolidated in federal court in Detroit.
   The next hearing is set for September. District Court Executive
John Mayer said it wasn't clear which suits would be tried or where.
   In November, the National Transportation Safety Board held a
week-long public hearing at a motel less than a mile from the crash
site. On May 10, the board found that the two pilots had failed to
properly set the airplane's flaps. An alarm to alert them to their
error failed to sound, according to cockpit tapes, but it has not
been determined whether it malfunctioned or was deliberately shut
off.
   If the flaps had been extended normally at the time of the
crash, investigators said, the plane, which never got more than 50
feet off the ground, would have been about 600 feet in the air,
climbing toward cruising altitude on its way to Phoenix.

<HEAD>Father John Irish: Was He Making Money Out of Misery?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the early morning hours after Northwest Flight
255 crashed and exploded on a highway last summer, a gray-bearded
man with a clerical collar was there to comfort relatives of the
156 victims.
   One of those relatives had a brother who was a Roman Catholic
priest, and something seemed wrong. ``Father John Irish'' withdrew
when pressed about some of the church's sacraments.
   Others reacted when the priest distributed the name of a Florida
attorney he said could handle damage suits.
   The Wayne County Sheriff's Department, now searching for the
``priest,'' says his real motivation was making money out of misery.
   ``There are always those who see the darker side of things for
opportunity,'' said Sheriff Robert Ficano.
   The investigation of Irish is one of at least two instances of
fraud linked to the crash. In the other, a New York man, then a
flight attendant, sent the department burned personal documents,
allegedly evidence of a 157th victim.
   The information was quickly dismissed.
   ``We took it as a joke when it arrived,'' said investigator Tim
Rapp. ``We checked with his family, who said he was having trouble
with his girlfriend.''
   But the department, along with the FBI, is taking Irish
seriously.
   By the time officials suspected Irish of unethical or criminal
behavior, he had left Detroit. A warrant was issued for his arrest,
charging he defrauded Northwest out of money for a motel room and
other expenses while he ministered to the relatives.
   Witnesses and law enforcement officials said Irish also
distributed business cards for lawyer Ronald Brimmell of Deerfield
Beach, Fla., who is licensed to practice law in Michigan.
   Ficano said no charges had been filed against Brimmell, and
Michael Schwartz of the Attorney Grievance Commission in Detroit
refused to say whether the commission is investigating Brimmell.
Repeated calls seeking comment from Brimmell were not returned.
   Irish vanished after leaving Detroit.
   Then, hours after a Continental airliner flipped and crashed at
takeoff from Stapleton International Airport in Denver on Nov. 15,
killing 27 of the 82 people aboard, police received reports of a
man matching Irish's description talking to survivors at Denver
General Hospital. He allegedly posed as a reporter and a private
investigator who said he was seeking clients for an unidentified
lawyer.
   Ficano said Wayne County investigators went to Denver area,
searched a condominium and found evidence linking Irish to Flight
255. Ficano declined to describe the evidence.
   But Irish eluded authorities again.
   ``We've been following some leads,'' Ficano said. ``He may be in
Canada right now. His mother lives there.''
   The sheriff said Irish's alleged scam involving Brimmell may
have worked in the past and he may be living off the proceeds of
past schemes.
   ``He'll likely surface when the money runs out,'' Ficano said.
``He apparently has a bankroll from other incidents.''

<HEAD>As a Topic of Talk, Rural Development Is Alive and Well</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For generations, farm and political leaders
have debated rural development and usually wound up being for it,
much like the proverbial consensus that apple pie and motherhood
are good and should be supported by all true Americans.
   So it is not surprising that the 1988 political season brings
another wave of dedication to rural development, including
suggestions on how to make life on farms and in small towns easier
and more beneficial to all concerned.
   An idea of what rural development is all about can be had from
recent testimony by two former secretaries of agriculture _ John
Block, a Republican who served in President Reagan's cabinet, and
Bob Bergland, a Democrat who was secretary in the Carter
administration.
   Block's views on rural development were in his general statement
last week in New Orleans at a Republican agricultural platform
hearing, and were intended to be partisan since he was helping mold
the 1988 GOP platform.
   Since he left the Agriculture Department's top post early in
1986, Block has been president of the National-American Wholesale
Grocers Association, Falls Church, Va.
   Bergland is executive vice president of the National Rural
Electric Cooperative Association, the Washington-based umbrella
group that represents about 1,000 rural power systems in 46 states.
   It was in his NRECA capacity that Bergland appeared last month
before a rural economy and family farming subcommittee of the
Senate's Small Business Committee.
   Both men described rural America and cited its place in the
nation's economic and social fabric. Each made observations and
suggestions regarding ways to aid rural development.
   ``The federal government can play an important role in helping
to revitalize the rural economy,'' Bergland said. ``However, such a
role must be carefully thought through and executed. In particular,
it is our experience that local development cannot be solved by
large federal spending programs which lack local support.''
   Bergland added: ``Successful efforts must have a strong element
of local commitment and initiative. The federal role should be
limited to doing what only the federal government can do, or what
it does best _ making use of its regulatory authorities, developing
standards, providing technical assistance, and, where needed,
financing.''
   Block, who noted that about 25 percent of the U.S. population
lives in rural areas, although only 9 percent are farm residents,
said rural development ``must be a high priority in the next
Republican administration.''
   Some other points made by Block:
   _Rural areas must be integrated with the nation's overall
economic health, and the business environment must be improved
through the implementation of rural enterprise zones and other
measures.
   _The federal government should help retrain rural workers by
targeting more job training.
   _All grants and formulas that allocate federal money to state
and local areas ``should be reviewed and changed if rural areas are
not receiving their appropriate share.''
   _Federal funds for rural road and bridge improvements should be
increased as part of an incentive program to get state and local
governments to contribute more to help in this effort.
   _Rural education should be upgraded ``so that employers will
locate in rural areas where there is a highly educated labor
force.''
   Bergland cautioned against the government jumping into massive
projects to overhaul the countryside.
   ``Generally, the most beneficial and long-lasting economic
development results are achieved by starting out small,'' Bergland
said. ``It is often more realistic for a local community or
cooperative to undertake a project that results in a few new jobs
rather than expend energy and resources pursuing a large employer.
Small successes can snowball into more successes which build local
vitality.''
   Further, he said, a ``can do'' attitude is necessary for rural
development. ``Those who are easily overwhelmed and have a
pessimistic outlook are bound to reap more of the same.''
   Bergland said, ``Development is a slow process which requires
patience, perseverance and an understanding that positive results
normally take time.''

   The dollar held steady against major currencies in
nervous morning trading today, but dealers expected a further rise
in the U.S. currency. Gold rose slightly.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar rose in the first half
hour of trading but then stopped and began fluctuating.
   Traders said they expected the dollar to resume its advance once
the U.S. market opened because the market was very bullish toward
the U.S. currency.
   ``The U.S. economy is so strong that it will continue to attract
funds,'' said a trader in Rome.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6865, compared
with $1.6830 Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.9210 West German marks, up from 1.9160; 1.6075
Swiss francs, up from 1.5960; 6.4785 French francs, up from 6.4325;
2.1707 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1570; 1,418.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,403.50; 1.2180 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2137.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 1.34 yen to a closing 134.92 yen following a
half-percentage point increase to 6.5 percent in the U.S. discount
rate on Tuesday. Later, in London, it was quoted lower at 134.77
yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $427.45 a troy ounce, up
from late Tuesday's $426. At mid-morning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $426.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $426.90, up from $426 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 48 cents to close at a bid
$430.13.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.62 a troy
ounce, up slightly from Tuesday's $6.60.

<HEAD>Batus Raises Bid For Farmers To $72 A Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   B.A.T. Industries PLC, maneuvering to win
approval of its hostile takeover bid for Farmers Group Inc.,
increased its cash buyout offer to $72 a share, up from $63 a share.
   The beefed-up offer, announced Tuesday and apparently tendered
to promote a possible friendly settlement, boosted the British
conglomerate's total cash offer to more than $4.9 billion from its
last offer of $4.5 billion.
   Farmers, a Los Angeles-based insurance holding company, has
resisted overtures made by Batus Inc., B.A.T. Industries' U.S.
subsidiary, since an initial $60 a share offer in January, but said
Tuesday it would at least consider the latest offer.
   ``The board of directors will give this new offer careful
consideration,'' said Leo E. Denlea Jr., chairman and chief
executive of Farmers.
   In sweetening its offer for Farmers' 68.4 million common shares,
Batus set a condition requiring negotiations of a definitive merger
agreement by Aug. 19.
   Farmers stock rose 12{ cents Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange to $57.75 a share. The new Batus offer wasn't disclosed
until hours after the market closed.
   Farmers has about $11 billion in assets. It is the nation's
third-largest home and auto insurer and seventh-biggest property
and casualty insurer.
   Batus also has been attempting to secure regulatory approval of
its hostile takeover bid from insurance commissioners in nine
states where Farmers does business.
   Those efforts have met with mixed success.
   Arizona is the only state to approve the deal, with decisions
still pending in Texas, Illinois and Kansas.
   In Ohio, the superintendent of insurance has given conditional
approval.
   Three states _ Oregon, Idaho and Washington _ have rejected the
takeover because of issues unrelated to the price offered by Batus,
Farmers said.
   California's insurance commissioner rejected the proposal, but
that decision was recently overturned by a state court. Farmers,
which does 40 percent of its business in California, said it would
appeal.
   Batus, which is based in Louisville, Ky., includes among its
holdings the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., which makes Kool
cigarettes, and several retailers, led by New York's Saks Fifth
Avenue.
   In the various state regulatory hearings, Farmers has repeatedly
suggested that if Batus took over, its tobacco holdings would
prompt the company to end Farmers non-smoker insurance discounts.
   Several members of Congress have opposed the Batus takeover on
similar grounds, prompting the company to assure governmental and
regulatory bodies it won't end non-smoker insurance breaks.
   The original California rejection of the proposed takeover was
based on a section of state law that forbids foreign ownership of
an insurer.
   About 10 percent of B.A.T. Industries stock is owned by various
government agencies, including town councils in Britain.
   Batus has acknowledged that the takeover bid initiated at the
beginning of 1988 easily could drag on into 1989 and cost the
company as much as $70 million in legal fees.

   Share prices were lower at midday Wednesday on
fears of further rises in interest rates following rate hikes in
both the United States and Britain.
   But the market wasn't rattled by sharp falls in Tokyo earlier
Wednesday and on Wall Street Tuesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 9.6
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,853.0, at about 12:30 p.m., its lowest
level for the day.
   The index fell 13.4 points on Tuesday.
   Volume was a light 239.6 million shares at midday Wednesday,
compared with 222.1 million shares at the same time Tuesday.
   Dealers said the market was stunned by the interest rate moves,
both of which had been unexpected.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday lifted its discount rate by
half a point to 6.5 percent.
   On Monday, the Bank of England signaled a half-point increase in
the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 11 percent.
   The London market had rallied last week, taking the 100-share
index near its post-crash high, in part on expectations of a stable
interest rate environment in Britain in the near-term, after a
series of rate rises beginning in June. In addition, few analsyts
expected a discount rate hike in the United States ahead of
November's presidential election.
   The London market now is concerned that inflationary pressures
in the United States and Britain might have been underestimated,
and that further rate hikes might be necessary, dealers said.

<BYLINE>By FELIX GUTIERREZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CERRITOS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As developments change the way people
communicate _ from cellular phones to interactive cable TV _ some
regulators and lawmakers say the Constitution's protections of
traditional speech and press need to be restated for the new media.
   Police can legally eavesdrop on cellular telephone
conversations, even though it would be unlawful to tap the same
conversations over regular phone lines without a court order, said
UCLA communication studies Professor Jeff Cole.
   It's also legal to spy on the phone numbers dialed up by a home
computer.
   And here in Cerritos, people are frustrated by another
constititional quandary. They can't receive a futuristic cable
system that would provide at-home shopping and banking, not to
mention lots of television channels, until it's determined who has
a right to install it.
   ``We are going to have to figure out a way to ensure the First
Amendment survives the technological revolution,'' said Federal
Communications Commission public affairs director John Kamp.
   In the Cerritos case, an official of the FCC _ which regulates
broadcast media and some telephone services but not newspapers and
magazines _ recently approved the laying of cable by the local
telephone company, GTE, which won a contract from the city last
year.
   But cable industry groups have asked the full FCC to review the
matter and a decision is expected in the fall, said Michael Morris
of the California Cable Television Association. The industry cites
federal regulations banning telephone companies from operating
cable TV in cities where they run the phones.
   ``The residents are frustrated,'' said Michele Ogle, a
spokeswoman for this upscale Los Angeles suburb. ``They would like
to see cable teleision. The surrounding communities have it.''
   Some media experts are concerned for a different reason. They
think the First Amendment, guaranteeing free speech and press,
should keep local and federal governments from deciding who sends
or receives information by the new media.
   ``The phone companies, like any other citizen, enjoy a First
Amendment right to be speakers,'' said Patrick Maines of The Media
Institute in Washington, D.C.
   Cable television should have ``little or no regulation at the
federal or local level,'' he said.
   Maines' institute houses the First Amendment Center on the New
Media, which has filed legal briefs and comments with courts and
the FCC in eight cases it feels threaten the First Amendment rights
of new media such as cable television, telephone information
services and electronic publishing.
   Cole of UCLA compared the state of law and the new media to
``the Old West where there's no established law and order, anything
goes, and the biggest guy with the most power always wins.''
   Some argue that the First Amendment is meant to ensure many
media voices and that government rules encouraging competition
among new media help meet that goal, he said.
   Letting telephone companies offer electronic information on
their wires could give them an unfair advantage over potential
competitors, according to former FCC general counsel Henry Geller,
now head of the Washington Center for Public Policy Research.
   ``I don't want the phone company to be in cable television and
control 50 channels,'' Geller said.
   Future fiber optic transmission lines, which GTE would test in
Cerritos, could become a ``highway into the home'' carrying
telephone, television, and text messages, he said.
   Today's new media blur the lines between categories lawmakers
and judges have used for years.
   The First Amendment was written more than 200 years ago, when
print was the only mass medium. The nation's communication act was
passed in 1934, when radio and telephone concerns dominated.
   ``It used to be easy to tell the difference between newspapers
and telephones. Now it's not so easy,'' said the FCC's Kamp. Some
newspapers send electronic copies of stories to home computers over
phone lines.
   ``I see no difference between the Washington Post I pick up at
my doorstep and the Washington Post that comes in on my computer
modem, except that I don't get newsprint ink on my hands,'' said
Ken Allen of the Information Industry Association, a group of 650
companies ``that see information as their product.''
   ``They (new media) should have the same protections that the
First Amendment provides other information sources,'' said Allen.
But he cited cases ``where information that is put in a new media
suddenly loses all of its (First Amendment) protections.''
   California's Legislature this year considered a state
constitutional amendment extending state free speech and press
protections to computer communications. The bill passed the state
Assembly but was stalled in the Senate after law enforcement and
credit information companies voiced opposition, said Bob Jacobson,
a consultant to the Assembly committee.
   ``I think the likelihood of all forms of communication having
full First Amendment rights is the most likely course over time,''
said Everette Dennis of the Gannett Center for Media Studies in New
York. ``It may take a long time to happen. But it's an
inevitability.''

<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has
sent Upjohn Co. a strong signal that its baldness remedy will be
approved.
   The Kalamazoo-based pharmaceutical company said it received an
approvable letter Tuesday from the FDA for its topical minoxidil
preparation for the treatment of male pattern baldness, developed
under the trade name Rogaine.
   An approvable letter is ``historically the last step before
final approval'' for marketing, company spokesman R.D. LaRue said.
   LaRue said the letter means the scientific data submitted by the
company have been approved, leaving only label language to be
worked out.
   LaRue would not speculate when final approval may be granted.
   The drug already is approved for use in several other countries,
including Canada.
   Minoxidil was developed as a blood pressure treatment, but the
company noted about 10 years ago that some of its users experienced
increased hair growth.

<HEAD>Diamond-Star Cars Will Be Available in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No test drives of the new sporty coupes
rolling off the Diamond-Star Motors assembly line will be available
until January, even though full-scale production begins next month.
   Part of the reason for the delay is that the cars produced at
the $650 million Normal plant will be 1990 models. Federal law
prohibits automobile manufacturers from shipping cars to dealers
more than 12 months in advance of their model year.
   ``Besides that, we have such a slow launch curve on production
that we wouldn't have the volume of cars needed to supply the
dealers,'' said company spokeswoman Robin Skiles.
   ``We'll only make about 3,000 units the rest of this year.''
   The state-of-the-art auto plant, a joint venture of Chrysler
Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, features high-technology
machinery, with robotics in the final assembly line.
   The first batch of cars produced by Diamond-Star will be divided
evenly between Chrysler and Mitsubishi for distribution to their
network of dealers nationwide. Chyrsler will market the cars as the
Plymouth Laser and Mitsubishi will sell them as the Eclipse.
   Ms. Skiles said Diamond-Star is not involved in sale or
distribution of the vehicles. In fact, Diamond-Star is not even
responsible for shipment of the cars to Chrysler or Mitsubishi.
   ``We manufacture them and the distributors handle everything
else, including hauling them from the plant,'' she said.
   Assembly of pilot cars started in June and Diamond-Star is
scheduled to begin full-scale production in the first week of
September.
   None of the more than 100 pilot cars will be sold. Ms. Skiles
said they will be used for promotion and testing in this country
and Japan.
   A prototype of the Laser will be on display Aug. 11-21 in
Springfield at the Illinois State Fair.
   Rebecca Caruso, a Plymouth spokeswoman in Highland Park, Mich.,
said each Plymouth dealer in the nation's top 100 markets will get
a new Laser for initial showroom display.
   Some smaller markets, including Peoria, will also get a car
because of high interest locally.
   ``The initial rollout is a small number of cars,'' she said.
``They will go to California first. Then Chicago might have a car
in a week or two. And then Peoria will get a car.''
   John Pashdag, Mitsubishi spokesman, said the Eclipse will be
distributed in similar fashion, although each dealer likely will
get more than one car because there are far fewer Mitsubishi
dealers around the country.
   Diamond-Star employs about 875 people and intends to have 1,300
people on board by the end of the year.
   A second shift will be added in 1989 to produce a four-door
compact sedan. Those vehicles will be marketed as the Mitsubishi
Mirage and the Plymouth Eagle Summit. Total employment at that time
is projected at 2,900.

<HEAD>Ailing Railroad Makes Final Pitch for $14 Million State Bailout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for the Chicago, Missouri & Western
Railway told a federal bankruptcy judge the company's finances are
improving and public interest demands that the carrier continue
operating.
   At immediate issue is $14 million in aid the state has offered
to keep the line rolling in the belief that the railroad is
important for the state's economic health.
   But the railroad's chief creditors, Citicorp North America and
Heller Financial Inc., oppose the bailout. They want to recover
more than $100 million in loans by liquidating the railroad's
assets.
   The two sides made their final pitch for the proposed $14
million on Tuesday before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Schwartz.
   The creditors' position has been that even under the best of
circumstances, the railroad's earnings won't come close to paying
even the interest on the loans in the coming years.
   ``Public interest ... dictates that the (state) loans be
granted,'' Donald Cassling, an attorney for CM&W trustee Daniel
Murray, told the judge.
   He noted that Gregory Baise, director of the state Department of
Transportation, and the Illinois Commerce Commission have testified
in favor of the loan.
   The CM&W filed for protection from its creditors in April,
listing debts of $131.8 million and assets of $103.5 million.
Cassling said its position has improved, although it still is
operating at a deficit.
   Gov. James R. Thompson, who offered the loans and grants, says
the railroad is crucial to 90 Illinois cities along its route, and
to the 300,000 people annually who use the Chicago-to-St. Louis
Amtrak service that runs over CM&W track.
   Schwartz allowed the railroad to accept $1 million of the
proposed bailout on July 29, to keep the CM&W rolling through the
completion of bankruptcy proceedings.
   The proposed loans ``really cost the lenders nothing but they do
add to the value of the lenders' collateral'' by allowing for
rehabilitation of deteriorating track and locomotive repair, which
will cut expenses, Cassling said Tuesday.
   ``The problem with that argument is that it's speculative,''
countered Schwartz.
   Liquidation would affect Illinois' ability to attract and retain
business, Cassling said.
   ``Passenger service to Springfield, the state capital, would
almost certainly cease,'' as would service to Bloomington, Joliet
and other cities, he said.
   Scores of jobs would be lost, not only at CM&W but at companies
that rely on the railroad, Cassling said.
   The railroad's 632-mile freight operation between Joliet and
Kansas City also would be affected, he said.

<HEAD>Sears Plans Free-Standing McKids Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., in another move into
specialty retailing, says it will open 20 to 40 free-standing
McKids children's stores over the next two years.
   The pilot program will help the nation's largest retailer expand
beyond its traditional image as the Big Store, a place that sells
everything under one roof.
   The McKids stores will feature brand-name children's products in
addition to McKids products, which Sears sells under an exclusive
licensing agreement with Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp.
   The first McKids store will open late this month in a shopping
center on Chicago's North Side, according to Michael Bozic,
chairman and chief executive officer of the Sears Merchandise Group.
   The mostly mall-based stores will sell national brands of
clothing, shoes, accessories, toys, games, books and novelties for
children, Bozic said in a statement.
   The merchandise sold in McKids stores will not be available in
any Sears store and is designed to supplement, not replace,
existing McKids products, he said.
   ``These new stores ... offer an opportunity to broaden our
customer base,'' Bozic said.
   Paul D. Schrage, chief marketing officer of McDonald's, said the
fast-food giant was ``delighted'' with the McKids plan.
   ``The store design is innovative and the quality of product and
service promises to be consistent with the high standards of
McDonald's and Sears,'' he said.
   Sears said the McKids stores were designed from a child's
perspective and, where possible, would feature child-size entrances
in addition to a adult-size doors.
   Sears' expansion into specialty retailing appears designed to
combat its loss of market share to specialty retailers in recent
years.
   In other such moves during the past year, Sears purchased the
Western Auto chain of tire and auto-parts stores; acquired
Pinstripe Petites, a chain of women's apparel stores; launched
in-store ``Brand Central'' superstores to sell brand-name
electronics and appliances alongside its own private-label goods;
and announced plans to open free-standing Brand Central stores.

<HEAD>FSLIC Settles With Philadelphia Law Firm For $50 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The senior partner of a law firm that agreed
to settle a suit with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
over the closing of a Florida association by paying $50 million,
denies any wrongdoing and called the settlement a proper business
decision.
   The Philadelphia law firm of Blank, Rome, Comisky & McCauley
agreed to settle the suit over management of a savings and loan
association that closed two years ago.
   The settlement was the largest ever paid by a law firm to the
federal agency to settle a claim, the FSLIC said in a statement.
   Proceeds from the settlement will be shared by the FSLIC and
former stock owners of Sunrise Savings and Loan Association of
Boynton Beach, Fla. Included in the settlement is the establishment
of a $10 million indemnity fund to cover any claims by outside
parties against the law firm, which represented Sunrise.
   David Girard-di Carlo, managing partner of Blank Rome, said
Tuesday the settlement was a ``proper business decision.''
   ``I believe settlement of the case is in the best interest of
the firm and all parties involved,'' he said.
   He added that he expected ``negative inferences'' to be drawn
because of the amount of the settlement but said the firm continues
to deny the allegations.
   The suit, filed in 1986 in U.S. District Court, charged that the
law firm acted negligently in advising Sunrise, improperly closed
loans, aided former Sunrise officials in violating several statutes
and banking regulations and represented parties with conflicts of
interest.
   The FSLIC sued the thrift's former officers, directors and
lawyers, including 87 partners and former partners at Blank Rome.
   Under the agreement, the FSLIC will receive 72 percent of the
first $40 million and 95 percent of the remaining $10 million.
Unused funds will revert to FSLIC and shareholders by August 1992.
   Sunrise was closed in 1986 and insured accounts were transferred
to the newly created Beach Federal Savings and Loan Association.
   ``This settlement demonstrates that where violations
contributing to insolvency are caused by the negligence or
malpractice of professionals, including law firms, the (Federal
Home Loan) Bank Board will hold them, as well as thrift management,
fully responsible and accountable,'' said M. Danny Wall, chairman
of the bank board.
   Blank Rome senior partner Michael Foxman founded Sunrise in
1980. His law firm colleague, M. Kalman Gitomer, once served as
chairman of the thrift.
   David Berger, a Philadelphia attorney representing the
shareholders, said it was an ``excellent settlement.''

   A consumer group claims California
financial institutions are ``encouraging homeowners to view equity
as an untapped gold mine.''
   San Francisco-based Consumer Action charged on Tuesday banks and
savings and loans are ``enticing homeowners into risking their
hard-earned home equity on frivolous purchases, vacations and
investments.''
   It called for a halt in the use of brochures that encourage
people to use home-equity loans for buying such items as wardrobes
and boats.
   ``I think it's irresponsible marketing,'' Consumer Action
Director Ken McEldowney said.
   ``They're trying to break that historical preference to
primarily use equity loans for home improvements,'' he said. ``It's
trying to create a need in the consumer's eyes.''
   The consumer group said its survey included 25 lines of credit
and 42 second-mortgage loan products at 28 California banks and
savings and loans.
   A home-equity loan is a line of credit given to a borrower based
on how much equity is built up in a home. As with credit cards,
consumers use only the amount they want and are billed only for the
amount they borrow. If consumers are unable to make their monthly
payments, they can be forced to sell their home.

<HEAD>CNW Chairman Dies at 58</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNW Corp. chairman and chief executive officer
James R. Wolfe, a specialist in railroad law, is dead at the age of
58.
   Wolfe died Monday of cancer, officials said.
   Wolfe served as CNW's chief executive for nearly 12 years, first
as president and CEO of the Chicago & North Western Transportation
Co., then as chairman, president and CEO of CNW Corp., a holding
company formed in March 1985.
   On July 11, Wolfe relinquished the presidency of CNW and its
railroad subsidiary to Robert W. Schmiege, the chief operating
officer of both Chicago-based businesses.
   Schmiege said in a prepared statement that Wolfe was ``the
primary architect of CNW's success and a true leader within our
industry.
   ``We have lost an articulate and forceful advocate for railroads
and their importance to the U.S. economy.''
   Wolfe was born in Hannibal, Mo., to a long-time railroading
family. His grandfather had been a locomotive engineer for the
Wabash Railroad and his father, James E. Wolfe, was vice president
of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.
   Wolfe, a graduate of DePaul University's law school, first
worked as a trial attorney for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
in 1953.
   He served in the Army and on several railroad commissions and
emergency boards, including a stint as general counsel of the
National Railway Labor Conference before joining the C&NW railroad
in 1968 as vice president in charge of labor relations.

<HEAD>Detroit Newspapers Move Quickly To Implement Partial Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANGELA AHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press moved
quickly to integrate operations following approval of their partial
merger, while readers bombarded the papers with questions ranging
from cost to crossword puzzles.
   The joint operating agreement, approved Monday by U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese, combines the newspapers' business, advertising
and circulation operations. Their editorial staffs remain separate.
   The Detroit Newspaper Agency, which will manage business
operations under the JOA, on Tuesday announced executive
appointments.
   Five Detroit News executives were named DNA executive vice
presidents: Publisher Louis A. Weil III; vice president for
marketing Richard J. McClennan; vice president for circulation
Robert J. Kurzawa; vice president for finance Gary L. Anderson, and
vice president for human resources Robert R. Taylor.
   Three Free Press managers named to executive vice president
posts with the DNA are Executive Vice President and General Manager
Robert J. Hall; Vice President for Production Robert F. Burns, and
Vice President for Labor Relations Timothy J. Kelleher.
   The first editions published under the JOA will appear Aug. 19.
   Meanwhile, the newspapers fielded questions from readers who
wanted to know more about the JOA. The Free Press set up a
toll-free hotline.
   ``Several callers asked about the Sunday New York Times puzzle
in The Detroit News,'' said Shannon Ross-Albers, a library clerk at
the paper who staffed the phone Tuesday.
   ``Others asked whose ink will be used,'' she said. ``Callers
said they don't like taking The News out in public because the ink
washes off.''
   Ross-Albers didn't know the answer to either question. Or what
would happen to Free Press sports columnist Mitch Albom's regular
Sunday column.
   Callers also asked about how much the newspaper will cost. The
Free Press currently goes for 20 cents and the News costs 15 cents
in Detroit and 20 cents outside the metropolitan area. The price
will go up but when and by how much has not been announced.
   Delivery was another concern. It will stay the same for the Free
Press. The News will switch to an afternoon paper. There will be
some morning delivery in outlying parts of the state, but where and
on what scale hasn't been announced.
   The newspapers, which rank among the 10 largest in the country,
said the Free Press was in danger of going out of business without
the JOA.
   Under the agreement, the papers will publish joint weekend
editions called The Detroit News and Free Press.
   The Free Press will cover news, sports and business on Saturday,
while The News will handle features. They'll switch roles on Sunday.
   Weekend editions will carry all the comics now published in both
papers.
   As many as 500 of the 4,500 employees at the two papers will be
notified within a few days that they be laid off, executives said.
No workers will be cut from the news departments.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Rises For First Time In 15 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 14 straight months of decline, Japan's
merchandise trade surplus reversed direction and increased 3.5
percent in July over its year-earlier level, the Finance Ministry
announced today.
   July's $7.18 billion surplus exceeded both the $6.94 billion
registered a year earlier and the $5.93 billion posted in June, the
ministry said.
   Japan's surplus with the United States shrank from a year
earlier to $4.49 billion from $4.79 billion in July 1987, but was
up sharply from $3.63 billion in June.
   Exports to the United States rose 4.0 percent from a year
earlier to $7.95 billion, while imports rose 21.4 percent to $3.46
billion.
   The overall increase in Japan's July trade surplus may partially
reflect the recent rebound of the dollar against the Japanese yen
on foreign exchange markets. The dollar, which began the year at
about 120 yen, was trading in Tokyo Wednesday at close to 135 yen.
   A lower yen tends to make Japanese products more competitive
overseas and foreign goods more costly in Japan.
   Ministry officials also attributed the widening of the gap
between Japan's exports and imports to increased sales of
semiconductors, chiefly to Southeast Asia, where many Japanese
companies have shifted assembly of electronic products as a way of
dealing with higher production costs at home.
   But ministry offi80.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 28.27 to
2,079.13.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 348 up, 1,206 down and 418 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 200.71 million shares, against 148.80 million in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Sprint Says Complaints Are Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US Sprint Communications Co. told a
federal agency that it is getting fewer complaints about billing
problems and the problems are being resolved more quickly.
   US Sprint's report on Tuesday was in response to a letter
received three weeks ago from the Federal Communications
Commission. The FCC said fines may be necessary if Sprint did not
handle customer complaints more efficiently.
   The FCC will have a chance to ask questions about Sprint's
response at a meeting today in Washington, said John Hoffman,
Sprint senior vice president.
   US Sprint, which has steadily lost money since its creation as a
joint venture two years ago, is the nation's third-largest
long-distance company after American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and
MCI Communications Corp.
   The long-distance company's report said the number of complaints
dropped to 111 in June from 211 in January, and it took Sprint an
average of 13 days to resolve a complaint in June, compared to an
average of 30 days in January.
   Sprint said it had received 149 complaints from the FCC last
month but 30 of the 52 complaints received in the final week of
July were postmarked in April, May and June.
   ``If those complaints had been received and processed by US
Sprint in those earlier months, we believe the declining trend
could still prevail,'' said the report, which was signed by William
T. Esrey, president and chief executive officer of United
Telecommunications Inc. of Westwood. Esrey also is serving as
Sprint's president.
   United Telecom owns Sprint equally with the GTE Corp. of
Stamford, Conn., but will take majority ownership later this year.
   The FCC said it had to review the report before commenting on it.
   ``It would be premature of me to say anything,'' said Greg Vogt,
chief of the enforcement division of the FCC's common carrier
bureau.
   After the FCC letter was sent, Vogt had said the volume of
complaints was not as serious as the number of times the agency had
to go back to Sprint about a particular complaint.
   Sprint's report defended the number of its repeated complaints.
It said they occurred in 14 percent of the 955 complaints sent by
the FCC in the first half of the year.
   The report also listed procedures that Sprint began on Aug. 1 to
improve the handling of complaints. A service center in Dallas will
contact customers 10 days after Sprint resolves a dispute to make
sure the customer is satisfied.
   Sprint said while improvements could be made, the brunt of its
billing problems were in the past.

<HEAD>Asian Population Hits 3 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-seven minutes after the clock struck midnight
Wednesday, the population of Asia reached 3 billion, according to a
report released by a group of politicians representing 19 Asian
nations.
   The Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and
Development report, based on data compiled by the United Nations,
said the population of Asia hit the 3 billion mark at 0047
Greenwhich Mean Time Wednesday.
   Asia, the world's most populous region, accounts for 60 percent
of the global total, which passed the 5 billion mark in July 1987.
Seven babies are born in Asia every second _ or 150,000 each day _
the report said.
   The forum, headed by Takashi Sato, Japan's Agriculture Minister,
issued the report at an international conference in Tokyo last
month heralding the Day of the Three Billion. The forum groups 19
Asian nations from Australia to Syria.
   ``The designation of a day marking the birth of the 3 billionth
baby in Asia is very symbolic,'' said Shigemi Kono, director
general of the National Institute of Population Problems. ``But I
personally think it is nonsense, because there is no way of
actually knowing when the 3 billionth baby was born.''
   Skepticism about calculations aside, however, Kono agrees there
are serious population problems in the region.
   ``Though we have come close to solving the fertility rate
problem in Japan and China, serious questions remain in India,
Bangladesh and Pakistan,'' he said.
   India, with a population of 818 million, has an annual growth
rate of 2.08 percent. Pakistan, with a population of 115 million,
has a 3.45-percent growth rate and Bangladesh, with 110 million
people, has 2.67 percent, according to United Nations estimates.
   By the year 2025, Asia will have 4.5 billion inhabitants, said
an official with the non-profit, Tokyo-based Asian Population and
Development Association. The estimated growth in Asia is roughly
equal to the increase in the total world population from 1950 to

<HEAD>Murdoch Outlines Financing Plans For Triangle Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. plans to raise money
to help finance its $3 billion takeover of Triangle Publications
Inc. by selling its stake in Reuters Holdings PLC as well as land
in Britain and Australia.
   Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Murdoch, said Wednesday
that the media magnate expects to raise about $200 million from the
sale of News Corp.'s 4 percent stake in Reuters, a London-based
news and financial information services agency.
   He also said Murdoch valued the undeveloped real estate holdings
at about $200 million.
   Murdoch's goal is to raise half the necessary funds by selling
assets and borrow the rest. While there are no formal commitments
yet from lenders, several banks have expressed interest in
participating in Murdoch's acquisition of Triangle, publisher of
Elle, Star, New York magazine and TV Guide, Rubenstin said.
   ``He is extremely confident of his ability to complete the
economic end of the deal,'' Rubenstein said, adding that Murdoch is
working with his financial advisers to determine which operations
will be sold to make up the balance of the $1.5 billion in asset
sales.
   According to Wednesday editions of The Wall Street Journal,
Murdoch has ruled out selling News Corp.'s 20.5 percent stake in
Pearson PLC, publisher of the Financial Times.
   Dismissing speculation that he would use TV Guide to promote his
Fox Broadcasting operation, Murdoch told the Journal that the
television magazine would strengthen News Corp.'s ability to
negotiate favorable positions at supermarket checkout counters for
his other magazines.

<HEAD>Massive Insider Trading Suspected On Tokyo Stock Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO_</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Securities regulators said Wednesday they suspect
massive insider trading took place on the Tokyo Stock Exchange just
before Nippon Steel Co. purchased a stake in a machinery maker,
driving up its stock price.
   It was an unusual admission in Japan, where trading on
confidential information has been an acknowledged way of doing
business. Until recently, securities laws have ignored all but the
most blatant forms of such trading.
   Officials at the Finance Ministry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange
said they were investigating trading in Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing
Co., a precision machinery maker, whose stock soared hours before
Nippon, Japan's largest steel maker, purchased an 18 percent stake
in the company.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange took the unusual move of suspending
trading in Sankyo shares on the afternoon of July 29, but the
volume of Sankyo shares traded in the morning session stil was
nearly 10 times the previous day's level.
   Securities officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they suspect a leak.
   The national daily Asahi Shimbun and the Japan Broadcast Corp.
reported that numerous Nippon Steel and Sankyo employees bought
several thousand Sankyo shares early on July 29. Both companies
denied the allegation.
   Under current laws, workers who bought the shares with prior
knowledge of the business deal will not be subject to criminal
punishment.
   A stock exchange official said the body has asked securities
companies that dealt in Sankyo shares to submit lists of investors.
   ``We have obtained information on about 90 percent of the people
who bought Sankyo shares on that day,'' said Hitoshi Shimakura,
head of the exchange's Transaction Review Section.
   The case is the latest in a series of stock scandals that have
shaken political and business circles in Japan and sparked public
outcry for stricter controls over insider trading.
   Earlier this summer, aides to some of Japan's top political and
business leaders, including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, were
found to have made huge profits by buying unlisted shares of a
Tokyo real estate concern and selling them after public trading
began.
   Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and a dozen other
top politicians admitted to their aides' involvement and apologized
for poor supervision.
   The deals were legal under Japanese laws but highlighted the
close ties between business and politics and raised questions about
political ethics.
   The Finance Ministry last week decided to speed up
implementation of the Revised Securities Exchange Law, which gives
authorities tighter surveillance and control and allows for
criminal punishment for insider trading.
   The new law, announced in February, will take effect in stages
beginning this month instead of November, officials said.

   Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in relatively light, cautious
trading ahead of an Agriculture Department crop report.
   The report is expected to indicate some drought-related
deterioration of crop conditions in July but traders weren't
willing to bet heavily on the USDA numbers.
   ``The pattern of trading ahead of a crop report is generally
quiet,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   On average, private analysts were expecting the USDA estimates
to show about a 38 percent decline in corn production and a 20
percent drop in soybean production from last year's levels.
   Widespread showers that brought badly needed rain to much of the
Corn Belt appeared to be tapering off today, and may support prices
in the grain markets, Spilka said.
   ``The weather is beginning to dry out a little now and I think
we'll see a warmer, drier pattern develop,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to 2} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.78{ a bushel; corn was
1\ cents lower to { cent higher with September at $2.99 a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1 cent higher with September at $2.69 a bushel;
and soybeans were 1 cent to 5\ cents lower with August at $8.53 a

   Live cattle were .55 cent to 1.43 cents higher with August at
69.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .63 cent to 1.15 cents
higher with August at 80.87 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to

   Share prices tumbled in nervous trading Wednesday
on the London Stock Exchange as the market was shaken by declines
in the stock markets in New York and Tokyo and worries about
interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 22.7
points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,839.9.
   Volume was a moderate 442.2 million shares, compared with
Tuesday's 424.9 million shares traded.
   Some analysts said Wednesday's setback was a retrenchment after
the market's recent advances.
   ``There's been no wholesale dumping of stock,'' said Andrew
Smith, economist at CL-Alexanders Laing Cruickshank Ltd. in London.
   Dealers said the markets have been unsettled by the unexpected
interest rate hikes earlier this week in both the United States and
Britain.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday lifted its discount
rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. That is its interest charge on
loans to member banks.
   On Monday, the Bank of England signaled a half-point gain to 11
percent in the British commercial banks' base lending rates.
   Market watchers were concerned with the Tokyo stock market's
performance Wednesday, as the Nikkei 225 Index plummeted 615.49
points, or 2.2 percent, to 27,554.87.
   London stock prices fell further when prices opened lower
Wednesday on Wall Street, dealers said. On the New York Stock
Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 27.38 points at
2,051.73 as trading in London wound up.
   In London, the Financial Times 30-share index was off 19.0
points at 1,482.1. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 11.85
points to 1,050.76.

<HEAD>Computer Company Agrees to $301 Million Buyout by Odyssey Partners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Micom Systems Inc., a maker of
computer communications equipment, announced it had agreed to a
$301 million buyout by a unit of the Odyssey Partners investment
group.
   Micom, which has been on the market since March, said Tuesday it
had accepted an offer from MS1 Acquisition Group, an Odyssey unit,
to pay $16 a share for Micom's 18.8 million shares.
   The company didn't say if the deal would bring a change in
management.
   The deal would be structured as a leveraged buyout, in which
loans for the purchase are repaid with money from the acquired
company's operations or by selling assets.
   Micom, a maker of microcomputer-based equipment that allows
computers to communicate with each other, has been torn recently by
a dispute among management and three dissident directors.
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting anonymous sources, said the
dissidents, including founder William A. Norred, were unhappy with
the company's lagging stock price and with what they considered an
overpriced acquisition of Spectrum Digital of Herndon, Va., last
year.
   Other dissident directors were San Diego investors John and
Sally Thornton, who are the company's largest stockholders with 2.3
million shares. Norred founded the company 15 years ago and stepped
aside as chief executive in 1985.
   Micom originally sought to buy out the dissidents, but put the
company on the market after offers surfaced.
   The company allowed a $15.62-per-share buyout offer to expire
last month. That was a joint proposal from Welsh, Carson, Anderson
& Stowe IV and Warburg Pincus Capital Co.
   New York-based Odyssey, founded in 1982 by former Oppenheimer &
Co. executives Jack Nash and Leon Levy, has been involved in a
number of investments, including the 1983 purchase of Chicago
Milwaukee Corp. and subsequent asset sales said to have netted the
partnership about $200 million.

   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported Wednesday its
second-quarter earnings rose 16 percent as the retailer's sales
increased 13 percent.
   Woolworth said it earned $43 million, or 68 cents per share, up
from $37 million, or 56 cents per share, in the second quarter of
last year.
   The company said its sales increased to $1.84 billion during the
quarter, compared with $1.63 billion a year earlier.
   The sales gain was helped in part by currency fluctuations, the
company said.
   For the first half, Woolworth said it earned $78 million, or
$1.22 per share, up 18 percent from $66 million, or 99 cents per
share, in the first six months of 1987.
   First-half sales rose to $3.55 billion from $3.16 billion.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Rises For First Time In 15 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose in July from
a year earlier for the first time in 15 months, the government said
Wednesday.
   Economists said it was too soon to conclude the steady shrinkage
in Japan's surplus had come to an end, and they noted that the
surplus with the United States continued to shrink.
   But some noted that Japanese companies have been raising export
prices lately, something that tends to swell the surplus.
   Japan's worldwide surplus rose 3.5 percent to $7.18 billion from
$6.94 billion in July 1987, and was also up sharply from the $5.93
billion posted in June, the Finance Ministry said.
   Japan's surplus with the United States, its biggest trading
partner, shrank 6.3 percent to $4.49 billion from $4.79 billion in
July 1987. It was up from $3.63 billion in June of this year.
   Although the dollar has risen sharply against the Japanese yen
this year, helping make Japanese goods more competitively priced,
economists said that was probably a relatively small factor in the
rise in the surplus.
   It typically takes more than a year before changes in currency
rates begin to show up in changes in the volume of goods shipped
between nations, the economists said.
   ``I don't think you can read too much into one month's data,''
said Mitchell Held, an economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co. in New York.
   Japanese export prices are rising partly because Japan's
domestic economy is growing so strongly that it has created
shortages of products for export, said Yoshihisa Kitai, economist
for the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan in New York.
   Moreover, Kitai said, Japanese exporters are beginning to push
through price increases after having held prices down to avoid
losing their share of foreign markets.
   Kyocera Corp., a maker of ceramic parts for electronics, raised
prices 18 percent earlier this year, said Thomas Chesser, a Smith
Barney analyst. He said Kyocera dominates its market so much that
it can afford to raise prices.
   Finance Ministry officials attributed the widening of the
surplus partly to increased sales of semiconductors, chiefly to
Southeast Asia, where many Japanese companies have shifted assembly
of electronic products as a way of dealing with higher production
costs at home.
   Exports of semiconductors during the month surged 51.3 percent
over the previous year's level to $1.11 billion, it said.
   In the long run, once foreign operations are well-stocked, the
movement of manufacturing off shore should begin to shrink the
surplus.
   Ministry officials said it was too early to tell if the July
trade figures signaled a long-term turnaround from more than a year
of shrinking Japanese trade surpluses.
   Overall, Japanese exports during the month rose 16.2 percent to
$23.13 billion from $19.9 billion, while imports grew 23.1 percent
to $15.9 billion from $13.0 billion, the ministry said.
   Exports to the United States rose 4.0 percent from a year
earlier to $7.95 billion, while imports rose 21.4 percent to $3.46
billion.
   Japan's surplus with the European Community grew from $1.53
billion in July 1987 to $1.97 billion in July this year. Exports to
the region rose 29.6 percent from a year earlier to $4.12 billion,
while imports grew 30.7 percent to $2.15 billion, the ministry said.
   Exports to Southeast Asia grew 23.2 percent to $5.77 billion,
while imports from the region rose 26.7 percent to $4.05 billion,
it said.
   When seasonally adjusted, Japan's trade surplus rose to $6.24
billion from $5.19 billion the previous month.
   Japan calculates its trade figures on a customs-clearance basis,
which includes transportation and insurance costs in imports but
not in exports. If the costs were added to both, Japan's trade
surplus would be higher.

   Insilco Corp. disclosed Wednesday that it
received several unsolicited buyout offers since a management-led
group's $950 million bid for the high-technology and specialty
consumer products company last week.
   Insilco did not identify the parties involved in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, but it said it had enterted
into confidentiality agreements with certain groups.
   Last Thursday, Insilco's board of directors approved a
$29-a-share management offer in what some analysts described as an
anti-takeover defense. At the time, analysts called the bid
reasonable and said they doubted a better offer would be
forthcoming.
   In recent years, Insilco, once known as the International Silver
Co., has restructured itself into an industrial holding company
with operating companies that make products for high-technology
industries and speciality consumer markets.
   Insilco makes Red Devil paints, Rolodex rotary files, metal
cartridges and other projectiles for the defense industry and
Dual-Lite emergency lighting equipment.
   Insilco earned $11.7 million, or 55 cents per share, in the
second quarter, compared with $11 million, or 52 cents a share,
last year. Revenue totaled $196.4 million, up from $154.3 million.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca says he
holds no grudges against Henry Ford II for firing him a decade ago,
preferring to remember the good times they shared, like when they
hunted, went to parties or ``caroused Europe together.''
   ``My difficulty with Henry Ford was over long before he died
last year,'' the 63-year-old Iacocca wrote in the Aug. 29 edition
of Fortune magazine, which was made public on Wednesday.
   ``Most people were remembering the last years of his life, when
Henry was sick with a bad heart, realizing that he was mortal and
worrying about his health day and night,'' he said. ``I tried to
remember the years beginning in 1960, when we were buddies.''
   The grandson of Ford's founder died about a year ago after more
than 40 years at the helm of the nation's second-largest automaker.
   Iacocca, who rose to stardom in the auto industry after creating
the super-popular Mustang automobile, was fired after more than 20
years at Ford Motor Co. in 1978. He has been at Chrysler since then
and credited for putting the once-troubled company back on its feet
with the help of $1.2 billion in government-guaranteed loans.
   ``A lot of people told me Henry Ford II did me a favor 10 years
ago by firing me,'' Iacocca said in the five-page Fortune article
he wrote. ``They said that if I had stayed at Ford, I would have
been in a comfortable ivory tower. The company would have given me
a gold watch when I retired, and that would have been the end of my
life.
   ``...By getting canned in 1978 I got thrown into a situation
where I became a leader.''
   Iacocca had few kind words to say about Henry Ford II in his
first book, ``Iacocca: An Autobiography,'' but in the Fortune
article he recalled how he and Ford ``hunted together, we went to
parties together, we caroused Europe together.''
   ``I remember the 16 good years, and not the two bad ones in 1977
and 1978.''

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in light trading marked by
nervousness about the Agriculture Department's upcoming crop
production report.
   Grain and soybean futures were led higher by the soybean meal
market, which posted strong gains on rumors that the Soviet Union
was shopping in Argentina for soybean meal pellets, analysts said.
   Some weather forecasts predicted a hot, dry weekend in the
Midwest, which added further support to the markets, said Joel
Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research Department Inc.
   But traders were unwilling to take large risks ahead of the USDA
crop report, which will be released after the grain and livestock
futures markets close on Thursday.
   The report is expected to indicate further deterioration of
drought-stressed crops during July.
   ``The pattern of trading ahead of a crop report is generally
quiet,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Private analysts' predictions of the USDA estimates averaged out
to a 38 percent decline in corn production and a 20 percent drop in
soybean production from last year's levels.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 6} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.83{ a bushel; corn was \
cent to 2{ cents higher with September at $3.01 a bushel; oats were
2 cents to 5 cents higher with September at $2.71{ a bushel; and
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 9\ cents higher with August at $8.65
a bushel.

   Stock prices fell sharply today, extending
Tuesday's decline amid continuing interest-rate worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 28.27 points
Tuesday, dropped 35.92 to 2,043.21 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 236 up, 1,291
down and 408 unchanged.
   The Federal Reserve's move Tuesday to raise its discount rate
from 6 percent to 6.5 percent remained the dominant topic on Wall
Street.
   Many analysts had been expecting the Fed to tighten credit
further. But the timing of the increase caught many traders by
surprise.
   ``Or perhaps it was the memory that the previous hike last
September was followed by you-know-what in October,'' said Newton
Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In one sense, analysts said, the Fed's action could turn out to
be a plus for the stock and bond markets if it achieves its stated
purpose of restraining inflation.
   But at the same time, it created problems for the stock market
by intensifying recession fears and adding to the allure of short
term interest-bearing investments, which compete with stocks and
bonds for investors' favor.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone & Telegraph
dropped \ to 26; Exxon [ to 45}; International Business Machines 1|
to 120, and General Electric } to 40[.
   Farmers Group climbed 5~ to 63| as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. The company, which had rejected a
$63-a-share takeover bid by B.A.T. Industries of Britain, said it
would consider a sweetened offer of $72 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.99 to 148.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 3.81 at 297.31.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 165.65 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Pietruski Resigns As Chairman Of Sterling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman and chief executive officer of
Sterling Drug Inc. resigned Wednesday, six months after the company
was acquired by Eastman Kodak Co., because of what one official
called a decline in his authority.
   John M. Pietruski, 55, is the fifth officer of Sterling Drug,
maker of such products as Bayer aspirin and Phillips Milk of
Magnesia, to resign since June, Sterling spokesman John H. Wood
said.
   Wood said that none of the resignations were prompted by Eastman
Kodak, which acquired the company in March for $5.1 billion. Kodak,
based in Rochester, N.Y., said at the time of the purchase that it
would leave Sterling's organization intact.
   The resignation is effective Aug. 31.
   ``When a publicly owned corporation loses its independence it is
not unusual for there to be significant changes in the duties of
the acquired company's chief executive officer,'' Pietruski said in
a letter to Sterling employees Wednesday. ``Now that Sterling is no
longer an independent company, I have experienced a similar change
in my position.''
   Wood said that after Sterling's acquisition by Kodak in March,
Pietruski was named executive vice president of Kodak reporting to
Kodak President Kay R. Whitmore
   ``Effectively Mr. Pietruski's reporting relationship dropped and
I think that's what that refers to,'' Wood said. ``There honestly
was no awkward relationship (with Whitmore), just a diminished
responsibility, frankly, and authority.''
   Wood said Pietruski's replacement would be announced on
Thursday. Among the likely successors are Leo ``Jack'' Thomas,
currently vice chairman at Sterling and formerly senior vice
president at Kodak.
   Pietruski, who was elected chairman of Sterling Drug in May
1985, did not say what he plans to do after he leaves.
   ``He has several options which he is considering, but he hasn't
decided yet,'' Wood said.

<TEXT>
   Procter & Gamble Co. said Wednesday it posted
earnings of $140 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a
loss in the same period a year earlier.
   The consumer products company said its earnings translated to 82
cents per share for the quarter ended June 30 and compared with a
loss of $324 million in the year-earlier quarter.
   The prior-year loss was attributed to an after-tax restructuring
charge of $459 million. Without the charge, Procter & Gamble's
fourth-quarter earnings would have risen 3.7 percent.
   The company said its fourth-quarter sales rose to $4.97 billion
from $4.17 billion.
   Procter & Gamble said it benefited from increased sales overseas
and a lower tax rate.
   The Cincinnati-based company makes and sells a variety of food,
household and personal-care products, including Pampers diapers,
Tide detergent, Folger's coffee, Vicks cough medicine and Ivory
soap.
   For the full fiscal year, Procter & Gamble said it earned $1.02
billion, or $5.96 per share, up more than 200 percent from $327
million, or $4.59 per share, in the previous year.
   Without the prior year charge, the company's full-year earnings
would have risen nearly 30 percent.
   Full-year sales totaled $19.34 billion, up from $17 billion.

<HEAD>Temporary Aeromexico Operation Extended While Pilots Negotiate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After the state-owned Aeromexico plunged into
bankruptcy last April, the government charted a course: create a
new, pared-down major airline and let a covey of fledgling carriers
grow.
   But negotiations on the new airline have been slower and more
complicated than anticipated, prolonging uncertainty and, say hotel
operators, losses in the crucial travel industry.
   The negotiations are being held up by disagreements over the
extent of the pilots' share in the new airline and their future
role in its management.
   The 54-year-old Aeromexico was one of two airlines that carried
the bulk of air passengers over Mexico's rugged, mountainous
terrain.
   In mid-April, its 43 planes were grounded overnight by a strike
of ground and technical workers protesting management plans for
cutbacks. Travelers were stranded, and cities served exclusively by
Aeromexico were left without service.
   Then, less than three weeks later, some of its jets were back in
the air under a limited, 90-day operation run by the bankruptcy
trustee, a government bank, to ease the crisis.
   With the new airline delayed, the temporary operation has been
extended.
   Flights to Aeromexico's foreign destinations _ including New
York; Miami; Houston; Tucson, Ariz.; and Madrid, Spain _ may not be
resumed until next year, an aviation source said.
   Crucial to forming the new airline are the 765 pilots who flew
for Aeromexico. When the company collapsed, flight attendants and
the 7,250 ground workers were fired and given severance pay.
   The pilots, however, still have their contract, although they
are flying only a few hours each with the temporary operation.
   Their union, which also includes pilots of the other major
airline, Mexicana, has a tentative commitment from the government
for about 35 percent ownership in the new airline. It's to be
called Aerolineas Mexicanas SA, possibly AMSA for short.
   As part of the government's shedding of its array of
non-strategic and unprofitable companies, the other 65 percent is
to be sold to private interests.
   Pilots and the government are negotiating both a new contract
and terms for the pilots' ownership in the still-to-be-formed
company that will hire them.
   The government blamed fat union contracts, along with chronic
losses, poor service and the four-day strike for Aeromexico's
financial failure.
   ``The situation of Aeromexico was totally unsustainable. It no
longer operated,'' said one industry source who spoke on condition
he not be identified.
   While the government wants to create a more efficient company
with fewer personnel that would be attractive to private investors,
some businessmen are reported to be wary of an alliance with a
union representing company employees.
   Alejandro Luna, an Aeromexico pilot and outgoing head of the
Aviation Pilots' Union, counters that employee interest in the
company's profitability should make it more attractive.
   ``It's a guarantee for anyone who's going to invest that its
labor problems will be at a minimum,'' he said in an interview.
   He said the two sides have set a mid-August deadline for
agreement.
   Any deal made on Aeromexico also could affect the value of the
government's majority ownership of the better-run Mexicana. The
government's shares in Mexicana are expected to be sold once the
new airline is formed.
   Officials at the Communications and Transportation Department,
the bankruptcy trustee and the temporary operation either declined
or did not respond to interview requests.
   A department plan published in late May calls for two trunk
airlines; two or three regional airlines for the Pacific and
Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico areas; and feeder airlines for five
sectors.
   Smaller, privately-owned airlines, notably Aerocalifornia and
Aeromar in the Northwest of Mexico, already are flying some new
routes and have begun buying new planes.
   Aeromexico, which carried 5.8 million passengers in 1987, is
flying one-fourth to one-fifth of the 250 or so flights a day it
operated before.
   Created as a private airline, Aeromexico absorbed 23
unprofitable airlines between 1940 and 1960. Nationalized in 1959,
it survived on government subsidies for years, something considered
acceptable in Mexico until reforms forced by the 6-year-old
economic crisis.
   But contract restrictions on work scheduling, ample benefits,
the high employee-to-plane ratio and other conditions made
cost-cutting difficult, the industry source said.
   ``Say a flight was delayed because of mechanical trouble. When
the plane was ready, just one hour of the work day was left,'' he
said. ``Crews decided they wouldn't make the flight. Or they would
be paid another full day or the flight would be canceled, and many
details like this.''
   Four percent of flights were canceled last year, 35 percent were
delayed and the aging fleet was constantly in need of maintenance,
the government said.
   Ironically, late last year efficiency measures had improved the
company's situation.
   The flight attendants union blames the losses on frequent
management changes, including four directors in six years, capital
flight due to corruption and a surplus of non-union employees,
among other reasons.
   The disruption ``definitely has had an impact'' on business,
Guillermo Rocha, president of the Mexican Hotel and Motel
Association, said.
   ``What worries us is that the start of the new airline has been
postponed,'' he said.
   In Mexico City, hotel occupancy has been running about 60
percent instead of its usual 85 percent for July and August, said
Marcos Romano, president of the city's hotel association.
   ``There aren't enough flights, both in the interior as well as
from the United States to Mexico,'' he said.
   Occupancy in Acapulco, the biggest Pacific beach resort, is
about 60 percent now, when it should be booked solid with Mexican
vacationers, he said.

<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's largest computer supplier,
Fujitsu Ltd., has signed a $280 million agreement to market Sun
Microsystem's workstations and servers.
   Sun Microsystems, the world's leading supplier of network-based
distributed computing systems, has experienced rapid expansion in
the last year, with 1988 revenues topping $1 billion, almost
doubling its 1987 revenues.
   The Mountain View-based company estimates that about 15,000 ``S
Family'' workstations and servers will be sold during the next
three years.
   The worldwide agreement will initially focus on the Japanese
market, where Sun currently sells more products _ directly and
through original equipment manufacturer agreements _ than any other
vendor.
   Fujitsu expects the Sun workstatons to complement its existing
workstation line, ``offering a more attractive total solution to
customers because of the availablility of of 1,500 software and
hardware products that run on Sun workstations,'' said Yasuchika
Koike, Fujitsu board director.
   ``Sun has always participated in strategic partnerships as a way
of expanding our markets,'' said Bernard Lacroute, executive vice
president of Sun. ``We have had a very good relationship with
Fujitsu in the past and this new agreement offers important
benefits to both companies.''
   Scott McNealy, president and chief executive officer of Sun,
said the company expects to show significant year-over-year
earnings increases per share in the next several quarters.
   ``The overall business environment, both here and abroad, bodes
well for additional increases in market share in the next few
quarters,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mitsubishi May Join `Reverse Importers' with Diamond-Star Model</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A front-wheel-drive sports coupe being
manufactured at the Diamond-Star Motors plant may be distributed in
Japan as Mitsubishi Motors Corp. considers joining the ``reverse
importers.''
   Japanese auto manufacturers Honda, Nissan and Mazda already are
shipping U.S.-made vehicles back to Japan. And Mitsubishi is
thinking of shipping its Eclipse model, to be made here, because it
will not compete with any autos now on the market in Japan.
   Richard Recchia, executive vice president of Mitsubishi Motor
Sales of America, said Tuesday the ``reverse import'' plan is being
considered.
   ``Imported cars are beginning to get strong in Japan,'' Recchia
told The Bloomington Pantagraph.
   The Diamond-Star plant is a joint venture between Chrysler Corp.
and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. The sports coupes produced in
Normal will be 1990 models available at Plymouth and Mitsubishi
dealers in January.
   A decision on exporting the Eclipse would be made within six
months and will depends on whether ``the domestic dealer network
over there wants it,'' Recchia told the newspaper.
   If the Eclipse is shipped overseas, he said it will involve
small numbers and will occur later next year or in early 1990.
   Toyoo Tate, president of Mitsubishi, recently told the Los
Angelese Times his company ``was thinking of importing from the
United States.''
   He said the Eclipse was a perfect candidate because it is
different from anything on the market in Japan.
   ``We will be making a completely different kind of sporty car in
the United States than we make in Japan,'' Tate said.
   Recchia said production of a convertible also is being studied
at the Diamond-Star plant with a decision expected by next spring.
   ``The biggest problem is the passive-restraint (seat-belt) laws.
Convertibles are difficult to put those in. If we can solve the
problem in an economic way, we could produce a convertible,'' he
said.
   Full-scale production begins in September at the $650 million
Diamond-Star plant. About 875 employees already are at work,
producing pilot cars and gearing up for the offical start of the
assembly line.

   Interest-rate worries overwhelmed the financial
markets again Wednesday and sent the Dow Jones industrial average
plummeting 50 points before a protective collar on program trading
was triggered.
   With less than an hour left in the trading session and the Dow
down 50.50 points, the New York Stock Exchange said it banned
member firms from using computer trading systems for index
arbitrage, the most prevalent form of program trading.
   The Dow closed down 44.99 at 2,034.14, for its fifth consecutive
loss. The downward trend in stocks intensified Tuesday when the
Federal Reserve announced an increase in a key lending rate.
   The Fed surprised traders by boosting its discount rate, the
rate it charges on short-term loans to member banks, by half a
percentage point to 6.5 percent to keep a lid on inflation.
   Fallout from the rate increase was felt in financial markets
around the world, as investors voiced worries that the Fed's move
is just the first of a series of hikes in global lending rates.
   Stock prices in Japan and Britain were hit hard. In Tokyo, the
already volatile Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues posted its
biggest lost since November, plummeting 615.49 points, or 2.2
percent, to close at 27,554.87.
   And in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index fell 22.7 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,839.9.
   In the credit markets, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond
slipped more than $13 per $1,000 in face value, while its yield
soared above 9.3 percent in late afternoon trading.
   ``The market's slashing its wrists again,'' said Ward McCarthy,
chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The Dow was lifted from its lows when the NYSE put into effect
its controversial collar, which bans the use of the exchange's
computer system for index arbitrage on days when the Dow average
rises or falls 50 points from the previous close.
   This marks the sixth time the collar has been put into effect
since it was approved as a temporary measure in April. The
Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing reforms that
include coordinated trading halts when the Dow falls 250 points.

   Raytech Corp., a manufacturer of
automotive friction material, said Wednesday it lost $62.9 million
in the second quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of its
wholly owned subsidiary, Raymark Corp.
   The loss contrasted with earnings of $2.6 million, or 82 cents
per share, for the same period last year.
   Sales increased 9 percent in the second quarter, from $34
million last year to $37.2 million this year. The most substantial
gains were made within the domestic wet clutch and brake business.
   Raytech shareholders approved and ratified the divestiture of
Raymark common stock during the annual meeting in May.
   ``The divestiture of Raymark Corporation will allow Raytech's
management to allocate resources previously involved with Raymark's
problems to Raytech's future growth,'' Raytech president and CEO
Craig R. Smith said.
   For the first six months of the year, Raytech lost $66.4 million
in contrast to a profit of $4.6 million, or $1.46 a share, a year
earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose to $75.5 million from $67.5 million a
year earlierr.

   Stock prices fell sharply to a 2{-month low
Wednesday as the jolt of Tuesday's increase in a key Federal
Reserve interest rate kept reverberating through the market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 44.99 to 2,034.14,
bringing its loss over the past five sessions to 99.93 points. The
average last closed lower at 2,031.12 on May 31.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
201 up, 1,401 down and 378 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 200.95 million

consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in domestic trading after
closing higher overseas Wednesday as a variety of factors fueled
trader anxiety about the currency's near-term direction.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $428.80 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from
$426.90 late Tuesday.
   Profit-taking, which followed the dollar's surge on Tuesday, set
in Wednesday morning after the U.S. currency was unable to climb
past 1.9250 West German marks, said James T. McGroarty, a vice
president at Discount Corp.
   The dollar was also hurt by concerns about U.S. trade deficit
figures scheduled to be released next week and by rumors of a
possible meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations,
McGroarty said.
   No meeting of the G-7 has been announced, but traders were
concerned a session might be called to discuss ways of ending the
dollar's recent advance, McGroarty said.
   The dollar was also buffeted by worries about declines Tuesday
and Wednesday on the stock and bond markets, he said.
   ``It's enough to keep the market a little nervous,'' McGroarty
said.
   However, the dollar's fall was broken by prospects of higher
interest rates. The dollar rose Tuesday after the Federal Reserve
announced it had increased its discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6
percent.
   The dollar began its day in Tokyo, rising 1.34 Japanese yen to a
closing 134.92 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted lower at 134.46
yen, and it slipped further to 133.675 yen in New York from late
Tuesday's 135.15 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6910 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6830 late Tuesday,
and in New York, the pound rose to $1.69715 from late Tuesday's
$1.6840.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.90685 West German marks, down from
1.9204; 1.5955 Swiss francs, down from 1.6065; 6.4505 French
francs, down from 6.4710; 1,409.50 Italian lire, down from
1,413.475; and 1.22735 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2160.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.9155 West German marks, up from 1.9125; 1.5995
Swiss francs, up from 1.5960; 6.4780 French francs, up from 6.4325;
2.1655 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1570; 1,414.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,403.50; and 1.2273 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2137.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $428.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $426 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the metal closed at a bid $427 an ounce compared with
$426 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 48 cents to close at a bid
$430.13 an ounce.
   In New York, gold closed at $429.20 a troy ounce on the
Commodity Exchange, up from $427.40 late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to a late bid of $6.67 a
troy ounce, up from $6.60 bid late Tuesday.
   Silver also rose on the New York Comex, closing at $6.677 a troy
ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $6.630.

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose 1.7 percent in July, the
smallest monthly increase in seven years, the central Bank of
Mexico announced.
   Inflation for the first seven months of the year reached 43.3
percent, the bank said, while the annual inflation rate from July
of 1987 was 122.3 percent.
   The government started an Economic Solidarity Pact with business
and labor last December to control inflation, which soared by a
record 159.2 percent for 1987.
   The central bank's report said the latest figures showed the
pact ``continues being successful in bringing down the inflationary
process.''
   Consumer prices had risen 2 percent in June, 1.9 percent in May,
3.1 percent in April, 5.1 percent in March, 8.3 percent in February
and a record 15.5 percent in January.
   The biggest contributors to the increase in the latest report,
issued Tuesday night, were an 11.6 percent increase in fresh meat
prices and 7.4 percent in rents.
   The bank's report noted decreases in 82 of the 302 categories
tracked for the consumer price index, among them a 1 percent
decline in health and personal care. Shoes and clothing fell 0.5
percent and transportation fell 0.2 percent.
   A key component of the inflation-fighting program is a freeze on
the minimum wage, prices of government-regulated goods and services
and the exchange rate of the peso currency.
   Critics of the solidarity pact say it was intended to
artifically control inflation to ease unrest before July general
elections, without correcting any of the problems that are the
basic causes.

<HEAD>Administration Puts Off Ruling on Import Protection Request</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said Wednesday it
has postponed action until the end of the year on a request by U.S.
ball bearing manufacturers for protection from imports.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said President Reagan
directed the Commerce and Defense departments to assess recent
efforts to improve the competitiveness of the ball bearing industry
before a decision is made on import restrictions.
   In July 1987, the Anti-Friction Bearing Manufacturers
Association filed a petition seeking protection under a 1962 law
designed to protect industries vital to national defense.
   ``The petition alleged that high levels of imports are seriously
weakening the domestic bearing industry's defense production
capabilities,'' Verity said in a statement.
   ``The administration ... is currently taking a number of steps
to better enable the domestic bearing industry to improve its
production capabilities,'' he said.
   Among the steps are new regulations requiring defense
contractors to use only U.S.-manufactured ball bearings and a
program to encourage the industry to modernize.
   ``Because the administration's actions are expected to improve
the bearing industry's ability to meet national security
requirements, the president is withholding a final decision ... at
this time,'' Verity said.

<TEXT>
   The jolt applied to interest rates by the
Federal Reserve singed financial markets again Wednesday, as
traders from Tokyo to Wall Street sweated over the prospects for a
global interest-rate spiral.
   The day started with a violent reaction in Japan, where the
already volatile Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues posted its
biggest loss since November. The index plummeted 615.49 points, or
2.2 percent, to close at 27,554.87.
   When trading shifted to London, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index echoed those rumblings by shedding 22.7
points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,839.9.
   And in New York, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
44.99 points to close at 2,034.14 after a loss of more than 28
points the previous day.
   The Dow had been off slightly more than 50 points with an hour
of trading to go Wednesday, but that descent was stalled when the
New York Stock Exchange triggered its post-crash collar on program
trading.
   The markets began reeling in the United States on Tuesday after
the Federal Reserve unexpectedly announced it was raising a key
lending rate. The 0.5 percent increase in the discount rate to 6.5
percent put the fee the Fed charges member banks for short-term
loans at its highest level in more than two years.
   Interest-rate worries then swept overseas to Tokyo, hitting a
market that some experts said was poised for a selloff.
   Noboru Terashima, head of research at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Asia, Inc. in Tokyo, said the Fed's decision hastened the
inevitable for the Japanese market, which had lately shown signs of
instability.
   Many observers said markets overseas were caught by surprise and
may have overreacted. Many investors around the world had assumed
the Fed would refrain from taking any interest-rate action until
after November's presidential election.
   But with the Fed's decisive, anti-inflation move, ``there's
worry on worldwide basis that everybody is competing, with interest
rates as their weapon,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president
at First Albany Corp.
   Japan, Britain and West Germany all have taken action recently
to push up short-term interest rates, and more hikes are expected.
   ``That makes markets fairly nervous even though cooperation
among the major Western trading nations hasn't broken down,'' said
Johnson.
   If interest rates become a drawing card for U.S. securities,
some of the money siphoned out of Japan's stock market could find
its way into American markets.
   ``There's no doubt that Japanese portfolio managers have an
ongoing appetite for U.S.-dollar assets, and this increased rate
differential makes them attractive,'' said Ronald Solberg, a vice
president and senior international economist at Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles.
   The Japanese government's long-term bond is carrying a yield of
about 5.4 percent, compared with a return well over 9 percent on
the U.S. Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue.
   Indeed, in the long run, rate hikes can help stabilize the
financial markets by calming inflation worries.
   But in the immediate aftermath of the Fed's action, fear appears
to be overwhelming investors.
   With the Dow down 50.50 points late in the trading session
Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange said it banned member firms
from using computer trading systems for index arbitrage, the most
prevalent form of program trading.
   The so-called collar, used for the sixth time since it was
approved as a temporary measure in April, bans the use of the
exchange's computer system for index arbitrage on days when the Dow
average rises or falls 50 points from the previous close.
   In the credit markets, bond prices tumbled as their yields
soared. The Treasury's 30-year bond plunged $17.50 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield surged to 9.36 percent _ a level not seen
since last December _ from 9.19 percent late Tuesday.
   The dollar, which initially rallied on the interest rate news,
pulled back amid some profit-taking. However, dealers said the
dollar's fall was broken by the prospect for higher interest rates.

<HEAD>Farmers Cool to Sweetened Offer from Batus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers Group Inc. responded cooly Wednesday
to a sweetened $5 billion friendly takeover bid from Batus Inc.,
and Batus pledged to continue a hostile bid for the insurer if
management refuses to negotiate.
   Batus, which is based in Louisville, boosted its cash offer on
Tuesday for a negotiated merger from $63 a share to $72 a share and
gave management until Aug. 19 to respond.
   Farmers announced it would study the offer with an eye to the
best interests of shareholders, but Treasurer Jerry Faulwell hinted
the higher price was unlikely to overcome management opposition to
the bid from the tobacco and retailing company.
   Among management concerns are that Farmers could end up helping
pay off the loans needed to finance the buyout, and oft-voiced
worries that the insurer might end up sharing costs of tobacco
liability suits against Batus.
   ``I don't know of any reason why our position with regard to
having certain non-economic misgivings about this offer have
changed,'' Faulwell said.
   The $72-a-share offer for a management-sanctioned buyout is
distinct from Batus' $63-a-share tender offer to the owners of
Farmers' stock, submitted in January and scheduled to expire
Thursday.
   Farmers has 68.4 million shares outstanding and employees have
options to buy an additional 1.5 million shares, putting the
potential cost to Batus at $5 billion.
   On Wednesday, Batus, a subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC of
Britain, hinted the tender offer to shareholders would be extended
beyond its Thursday expiration deadline. But the company said it
didn't intend to boost the price in the tender offer beyond $63 a
share.
   As of July 15, holders of 31 percent of Farmers' shares had
offered to sell to Batus, the company said.
   Farmers, with $11 billion in assets, is the nation's
third-largest home and auto insurer and seventh-biggest property
and casualty insurer.
   Batus has retailing operations led by Saks Fifth Avenue stores
and its Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. makes Kool, Viceroy and
other cigarette brands.
   Farmers has been battling Batus in hearings before insurance
regulators in nine states where a takeover needs government
approval.
   Arizona regulators approved a merger and Ohio gave conditional
approval. Oregon, Idaho and Washington have rejected Batus and
California regulators rejected it only to have the decision
overturned by a state judge.
   Decisions or hearings are pending in Texas, Illinois and Kansas,
and the decisions already made in other states are in various
stages of appeal by both companies.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Soar As Cash Market Hits 2-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle futures soared their permitted daily limits Wednesday on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as a surge in meat-packer demand
pushed cash prices for fattened steers to their highest level in
nearly two months.
   On other commodity markets, stock-index futures plunged;
precious metals advanced; grains and soybeans were higher; and
energy futures were mixed.
   Meat-packers in western Kansas and Texas paid up to 69 cents a
pound for fed cattle, apparently to build up their inventories for
an expected upswing in retail beef demand before the Labor Day
weekend.
   It was the highest price paid for cattle since June 17, when
packers bid 70 cents a pound, said Thomas Morgan, president of
Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the price for August
delivery of live cattle settled 1.17 cents higher at 69.42 cents a
pound and the October contract gained 1.50 cents, the maximum
movement allowed by the exchange.
   ``What pushed the (futures) market up was the speculation _ and
speculation is the key word here _ that the (cash) market might go
to 69.50 or 70,'' Morgan said.
   But market bears believe packers now have enough cattle on hand
to satisfy the Labor Day demand and will become less aggressive in
their bidding, he said.
   The live-cattle rally spread to the neighboring feeder cattle
pit, where limit gains also were recorded, and the pork pits. Most
frozen pork belly contracts gained 2 cents a pound, the limit in
that market.
   Pork bellies also were supported by a Chicago Mercantile
Exchange report indicating an upturn in demand for pork bellies,
from which bacon is made.
   Live cattle settled .90 cent to 1.50 cents higher with August at
69.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .85 cent to 1.50 cents
higher with August at 81.22 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent to
1.37 cents higher with August at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .18 cent to 2 cents higher with August at 34.80 cents
a pound.
   Tuesday's boost in the discount rate, the rate the Federal
Reserve charges on short-term loans to member banks, reverberated
through financial futures markets on Wednesday. The Fed raised the
rate half a percentage point to 6.5 percent.
   Treasury bonds for September delivery tumbled 1\ points to 84
31-32 on the Chicago Board of Trade, and the contract for September
delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index plunged 5.35
points to 262.05 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Those declines, combined with a weaker dollar and the rise in
agricultural commodity prices, spurred buying of precious metals
futures, analysts said. Precious metals are considered relatively
safe investments in a turbulent economy.
   Silver got an additional boost from ideas that a resolution was
near in the 3-week-old miners' strike in Peru, said Bette
Raptopoulos, precious metals analyst in New York with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A scheduled vote Thursday in the House of Representatives on a
proposal for stronger trade sanctions against South Africa gave
platinum futures prices an extra upward shove, Raptopoulos said.
   Platinum for October delivery settled $13.50 higher at $535.80 a
troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold was $1.70 to $1.80 higher
with August at $429.20 a troy ounce; silver was 8.2 cents to 8.7
cents higher with September at $6.71 a troy ounce.
   Most crop futures moved higher on the Chicago Board of Trade in
light trading amid nervousness about the Agriculture Department's
upcoming crop production report.
   Grain and soybean futures were led higher by the soybean meal
market, which posted strong gains on rumors that the Soviet Union
was shopping in Argentina for soybean meal pellets, analysts said.
   But traders were unwilling to take large risks ahead of the USDA
crop report, which will be released Thursday after the grain
markets close.
   The report is expected to indicate further deterioration of
drought-stressed crops during July.
   Private analysts' predictions of the USDA crop estimates
averaged out to a 38 percent decline in corn production and a 20
percent drop in soybean production from last year's levels.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 6} cents higher with September at
$3.83\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents higher with September
at $3.00} a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 5 cents higher with
September at $2.71{ a bushel; soybeans were 8{ cents lower to 9
cents higher with August at $8.64{ a bushel.
   Oil futures prices settled mixed, with prices for future
delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline skidding lower and crude
and heating oil mixed in generally quiet trading.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents lower to 3
cents higher with September at $15.71 a barrel; heating oil was .05
cent to .10 cent higher with September at 44.15 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .58 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
September at 45.57 cents a gallon.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices tumbled Wednesday in active trading,
still reeling from the shock of Tuesday's increase in the discount
rate and catapulting interest rates to their highest levels this
year.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond dropped about 1}
points, or a hefty $17.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its
yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator
of interest rate trends, surged to 9.36 percent from 9.19 percent
late Tuesday.
   The yield on the key 30-year issue hasn't been that high since
Dec. 10, 1987, when it reached 9.40 percent.
   Short-term Treasury bills were mixed.
   Analysts said bond prices continued to be weakened by the
half-point rise, to 6.5 percent, in the interest rate the Federal
Reserve charges on loans to member U.S. financial institutions.
   ``The market's slashing its wrists again,'' said Ward McCarthy,
chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   Many bond traders are fearful that Tuesday's move could be the
first of a series of hikes in the discount rate, analysts say.
   The Fed said it raised the discount rate to reduce inflationary
pressures on the economy.
   Credit markets are concerned that increased inflation could
erode the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds. A rise in
interest rates, however, tends to send bond prices lower.
   Analysts said bonds were also dragged down by market
expectations that a government auction of $11 billion in 10-year
Treasury notes late Wednesday wouldn't be well received by
investors. On Tuesday, the government's companion auction of
three-year notes had been disappointing.
   The negative expectations for Wednesday's note sale were
confirmed late in the trading session when the results were
announced by the Treasury.
   Yields on the 10-year notes rose to the highest level in nearly
three years. The average yield was 9.27 percent, up from 9.06
percent at the last comparable auction on May 11.
   ``They were pretty dismal,'' said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice
president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The demand that everybody
thought was out there pretty much dried up at the auction.''
   On Thursday, in the third and final leg of the quarterly
refunding, the Treasury plans to auction $7 billion in 248-day cash
management bills.
   In the secondary market for Treasury issues Wednesday,
short-term government securities fell by between [ point and 13-32
point, intermediate maturities lost { point to nearly a full point,
and 20-year bonds dropped about 1] points, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, slumped 7.58 to 1,125.97.
   Corporate bonds were slightly lower. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, slipped
0.06 to 281.33.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, declined to
7.20 percent as the discount fell 6 basis points to 6.99 percent.
Yields on six-month bills slipped to 7.77 percent as the discount
was unchanged at 7.39 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to
8.16 percent as the discount advanced 4 basis points to 7.60
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 percent, up from 7 11-16
percent late Tuesday.

   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
asked the government on Wednesday to take action against Argentine
trade, saying Argentina fails to protect its patents.
   The association says its members have lost $526 million since
1980 because Argentine law denies patent protection to medical
compounds.
   President Reagan announced on July 22 he would restrict imports
worth $200 million from Brazil because of a similar petition.
   Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, said: ``Our industry's initiatives on
intellectual property have led to improved protection in (South)
Korea and Taiwan, to constructive negotiations with Chile, and to
ongoing discussions between the United States and Thailand and
Indonesia.
   ``Our goal is not trade retaliation but the recognition and
granting of our intellectual property rights.''
   Worldwide divergences over how to protect ``intellectual
property'' _ patents and copyrights _ have led the administration
to give priority to the issue in current trade negotiations
involving about 100 countries.

   The changes are designed to avoid unintended situations in which
the Commerce Department rules required Japanese companies to price
their chips artificially high.
   Japanese chipmakers will be allowed to spread out their costs of
introducing a new kind of chip over an ``appropriate'' length of
time instead of having to raise prices enough to recoup all their
costs in the first three months, the Commerce Department said.
   Also, chipmakers will also be allowed to spread out their costs
over longer than three months when they start up a new line to
produce an existing product line.
   The changes apply to the two kinds of chips covered by a 1986
anti-dumping agreement between the United States and Japan, namely
dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) and erasable, programmable
read-only memories (EPROMs).
   The Commerce Department informed the Semiconductor Industry
Association and the American Electronics Association of its
decisions in a letter Tuesday, and those organizations issued
statements on Wednesday supporting the decisions.
   The government changes would mainly benefit companies that use
chips, which have suffered from the unintended price spikes caused
by the old Commerce Department rules.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association, which consists of chip
producers, went along with the American Electronics Association in
requesting the changes in a June 21 letter to the government
because of an interest in creating harmony in the electronics
industry.
   Allen Moore, the undersecretary of Commerce for international
trade, said in his letter that ``the unified approach of your two
organizations is an integral element of developing sound public
policy approaches.''

<HEAD>Unisys Agrees to Buy Convergent for $350 Million In Cash and Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. has agreed to buy the
computer firm Convergent Inc. for an estimated $350 million in cash
and Unisys stock, company officials said Wednesday.
   The agreement calls for Unisys to pay $7 a share for the 50
million outstanding shares of Convergent in a transaction is
expected to be 45 percent cash and 55 percent stock.
   Unisys spokesman J. Peter Hynes said the company reserved the
right to change the deal to all cash.
   Unisys stock fell 50 cents to $33.37{ a share Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Convergent fell 0.063 cent to $3.438 a
share in national over-the-counter trading. The buyout agreement
was announced after the markets closed.
   Under the agreement, which is subject to approval by
stockholders and both company boards of directors, Convergent will
merge with a Unisys subsidiary involved in similar engineering and
manufacturing of networked computer systems.
   Hynes said the acquisition would bring talented computer
engineers and designers into Unisys, significantly strengthening
the company's manufacturing capabilities.
   ``We don't want to be beholden 100 percent to outside
suppliers,'' Hynes said.
   Since Convergent's creation in 1979, Unysis has been one of its
biggest customers, accounting for about 20 percent of the company's
revenue, Convergent Chairman Paul C. Ely said.
   Under the agreement, Ely will join the Unisys management board
reporting to Unisys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer W. Michael
Blumenthal and will oversee the company's networked computer
business.
   Cyril J. Yansouni, Convergent's president, will assume overall
responsibility for the merged Convergent. Both men will remain at
Convergent's current headquarters in San Jose, Calif.
   Convergent had total revenue of $385 million in 1987. Unisys has
projected revenue of more than $10 billion for 1988, making it the
nation's third-largest computer maker after International Business
Machines Corp.
   Unisys projects that its networked computers business will
generate $1.7 billion in revenue in 1988. The combined networked
computer businesses are expected to produce annual revenue of more
than $2 billion.

<TEXT>
   Affiliated Publications Inc., publisher of the
Boston Globe, reported Wednesday that it lost $10.5 million during
the second quarter of this year, due to its share of losses by
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
   In the same period last year, Affiliated posted a profit of
$72.8 million, or $1.03 per share. The year-earlier period
reflected Affiliated's $39.9 million share of gains from the sale
of discontinued McCaw operations and its $17.9 million share of a
one-time credit.
   Second quarter revenue rose to $140.4 million from $125.9
million in the year-earlier period.
   The company said its share of losses in McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. reduced its net income by $26.5 million for the
quarter.
   Affiliated reported second quarter income from consolidated
operations _ which does not include the impact of charges from of
its invsetment in McCaw _ of $16 million, down 6 percent from the
same period last year.
   The company now owns more than 61.5 million shares of common
stock in MCCI, the nation's largest cellular telephone systems
operator.
   For the first six months of the year, Affiliated reported losses
of $24.8 million on revenue of $267.1 million. That compared with
net earnings of $81.5 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of
$228.7 million in the first six months of last year.

   The Federal Reserve Board, in a move to fight

   The increase in the discount rate, to 6.5 percent from 6

and put the rate at its highest in more than two years.
   The move sent stocks and bonds tumbling but gave the dollar a

   The souring of earlier optimism about the impact

futures prices lower.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, declined 19 cents Tuesday to close at $15.68 a barrel.
   Prices of refined oil products traded on the exchange also
retreated Tuesday. Wholesale heating oil for September delivery
lost 0.43 cent a gallon to finish at 44.07 cents, while wholesale
unleaded gasoline for September fell 0.50 cent to 46.15 cents.
   The September crude contract had jumped 61 cents a barrel on
Monday, on a wave of optimism sparked by U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar's announcement that Iran and Iraq would
begin a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war on Aug. 20.
   Many traders believed the cease-fire would lead to more cohesion
within the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
of which Iran and Iraq are members, making it more likely the
cartel could cut production to help boost prices.
   But the market bullishness evaporated Tuesday amid skepticism
about the ability of Iran and Iraq _ both of which will need funds
desperately to rebuild their war-torn economies _ to adhere to
their official production quotas set by OPEC.

<HEAD>`Yuppie Five' Ringleader Gets Four Months in Jail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

   An attorney who was a central figure in the
so-called ``Yuppie Five'' insider trading ring has been sentenced
to four months in prison, by a judge who also contended the lawyer
should be disbarred.
   ``You completely disrupt the forces of the free market and help
to create incredible cynicism among the general populace,'' U.S.
District Judge John Keenan said before sentencing attorney Michael
David on Tuesday.
   David pleaded guilty in November 1986 to four criminal counts
for his part in an insider trading scheme with three other Wall
Street professionals and an investor.
   The five, who all have pleaded guilty to various charges, all
were in their 20s at the time of the indictment.
   David has admitted stealing clients' confidential corporate
information from the law firm he once worked at and passing it on
to the others.
   The case was unrelated to insider trading cases involving Ivan
F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine.
   David, 30, of Manhattan, the last of the ``Yuppie Five'' to
plead guilty after Keenan denied his pre-trial motions in late
1986, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud
and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange Comnmission
investigation.
   Defense attorney Darrell Fennell asked for leniency, saying that
David, once an associate at the the prominent New York law firm of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, faces disbarment and
has been driving a cab to support himself.
   Visibly irritated, Keenan countered: ``I don't think anyone
should confuse the practice of law with a right _ it's a
privelege!''
   ``The very least he should face _ as far as I'm concerned _ is
disbarment,'' said Keenan.
   Fennell said David was not a ``classic'' insider trader because
he had not traded on the secret information he stole and did not
make any illegal profits.
   But assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr., said David
was ``trying to make contacts and get a job in the arbitrage
community.'' Arbitragers speculate on the stock of corporations
that are potential merger or takeover targets.
   David, dressed in a dark gray suit, told Keenan before sentence
was imposed that he regretted his conduct, and asked the judge for
an opportunity ``to help rebuild my life as I have tried to do.''
   Keenan sentenced David to four months in prison and four years
probation, and said he would have imposed a longer jail term if not
for David's cooperation with federal investigators.
   Lowenson said David had cooperated extensively for almost two
years with federal investigators and would be an important
government witness if there were any future trials arising from the
probe.
   Keenan did not impose a fine but David faces civil penalties of
between $50,000 and $150,000 under an SEC consent agreement.
