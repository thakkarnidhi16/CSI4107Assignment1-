<HEAD>New Center-Left Government Takes Office, Devalues Krona</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new center-left government headed by
former Prime Minister Steingrimur Hermannsson took office
Wednesday, enacting an immediate price-wage freeze and devaluating
the Icelandic krona.
   The government, in a statement issued immediately after assuming
power, announced a 3 percent devaluation of the krona, a wage
freeze until mid-February and a price freeze until the end of
February in a bid to stave off Iceland's acute economic problems.
   Thorsteinn Palsson's 15-month center-right coalition government
resigned last week after failing to agree on economic policy.
   Hermannsson's nine-member Cabinet groups his centrist
Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Party and the leftist
People's Alliance. It was sworn in by President Vigdis
Finnbogadottir following negotiations among the political parties
without an election being called.
   Hermannsson said his government's top goal was to bring down the
annual rate of inflation from its present level of 25 percent to
around five percent by the middle of next year.
   The fishing industry, accounting for two-thirds of this North
Atlantic island nation's foreign exchange earnings, has been
especially hard-hit by the crisis and is reported near bankruptcy.
   The fishing industry has demanded a sharp devaluation of the
krona to cut the price of its exports, making them more
competitive. But a currency devaluation automatically pushes up the
price of imports from abroad.
   One U.S. dollar was worth 46.76 kronur immediately before
Wednesday's devaluation, the third this year.
   Hermannsson was foreign minister in Palsson's government, which
took office in June 1987.
   Under a NATO agreement, this nation of 250,000 people is the
site of a major U.S. air base at Keflavik, 25 miles southwest of
the capital Reykjavik, guarding strategic sea routes.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A demonstration set for Thursday in
support of the soldiers who overthrew the regime of Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy was canceled after soldiers seized an arms cache and
arrested two men, radio stations said.
   Radio Haiti Inter said troops on Wednesday arrested two men
identified as Clifford Mayard Paul and Jean Marie Gouffe at the Ido
Lele, a luxury hotel on the heights of Petionville overlooking
Port-au-Prince, the capital.
   In the men's hotel room, the soldiers found three Uzi machine
guns, grenades and grenade launchers, the radio said.
   Opposition leader Louie deJoie Jr., head of the National
Industrial and Agricultural Party and a member of the Committee for
Democratic Understanding, told The Associated Press late Wednesday,
``It seems that the government is doing its job, which is to disarm
the Macoutes.''
   It was a reference to the dread Tonton Macoutes, the private
militia during the 29-year Duvalier dynasty that suppressed all
opposition.
   The arrests were made in line with a communique issued Tuesday
night by the minister of defense and interior, Col. Carl
Dorfainvil, calling on the people to hand in any unregistered
weapon to the nearest military authority.
   Wednesday's developments prompted leaders of the Confederation
of Democratic Unity to urge the people not to demonstrate.
   The Confederation was the largest and most influential of the
six organizations that called for the demonstration hailing
Namphy's ouster nearly two weeks ago.
   In a communique read over Radio Haiti Inter, the Confederation
said, ``The Macoutes are getting ready to take reprisals against
the demonstrators.''
   Confederation leaders told the AP the decision to cancel the
demonstration also was influenced by reports over Radio Soleil of
many calls from listeners saying that ``those who had perpetrated
the massacre'' at the aborted Nov. 29 elections last year were
going to ``wreak havoc'' on the demonstration.
   Thugs and soldiers killed 34 people on on Nov. 29, 1987, the day
general elections were being held, forcing the elections to be
called off.
   The other five organizations that called the demonstration did
not react to immediately to the Confederation's announcement.
DeJoie, whose organization is not one of the five, agreed with the
call for cancellation.
   The planned demonstration had not had the support of Syvio
Claude, leader of the Haitian Christian Democratic Party and one of
the most influential politicians in the democratic opposition.
   Claude said over Radio Metropole Wednesday afternoon that a
demonstration in favor of the government ``is a little premature.''
   Claude said that Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the new president ``has
just come to power; he is not in the camp of the people but in the
Duvalierist camp... We ought to wait a while to see whether Avril
is on the same wavelength as the soldiers.''
   Soldiers have repeatedly said they want to purge the army and
government of Duvalierists.
   The demonstration was announced on Wednesday by the left-leaning
Confederation of Democratic Unity, the Autonomous Union of Haitian
Workers, and four other civic action groups.
   Hundreds of striking government workers of the state flour mill
meanwhile demonstrated in the capital Wednesday, protesting the
appointment of Yves Jose, a Duvalierist civil servant, to head
their enterprise.
   The appointment of Jose, former general director and state
secretary of the Finance Ministry under ousted President
Jean-Claude Duvalier, was announced over state television Tuesday
night..
   A workers delegation briefly met with Avril in the National
Palace to discuss the contested appointment. In an interview with
Radio Haiti-Inter, Ady Jean Maxime, vice-president of the company
union, said the delegation then reached a compromise solution with
Finance Minister Leonce Thelusma.
   Strikes began Wednesday in the Port Authority and National
Credit Bank after management leadership.
   On Sept. 17, Avril was named president of the military
government by the rank-and-file soldiers of the Presidential Guard
who had just ousted Namphy. Namphy had deposed the civilian
president, Leslie Manigat, three months before.
   Avril and the leader of the soldiers, Sgt. Joseph Heubreux, are
governing in tandem.
   Duvalier, who succeeded his late father, Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier, fled into exile in France during a popular uprising in
February 1986.

<HEAD>Mayor Prevents Eviction Of Olympic Medal-Winning Boxer's Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials paid the back rent of a
Filipino boxer to prevent the family of the country's first Olympic
medal winner in 24 years from being evicted from their apartment.
   Divina Serantes told The Manila Chronicle that her husband,
Leopoldo Serantes, had so much on his mind that he left the family
without a cent when he departed for Seoul, South Korea, to compete
in the Summer Olympics.
   ``Pol really left nothing behind,'' Mrs. Serantes said,
referring to her husband by his nickname. She said the family,
including three children, was three months' behind in its rent.
   On Tuesday, Manila Mayor Mel Lopez sent an aide to the Serantes
family with enough money to pay the rent, the newspaper said.
   Serantes, an army sergeant, stopped Majjoub M'Jirih of Morocco
in the third round of their 105-pound class fight on Tuesday,
assuring the Philippines of its first medal in regular Olympic
competition since 1964.
   Serantes, who is assured of a bronze medal, tries for the silver
on Thursday when he goes against Ivailo Hristov of Bulgaria.
   The Philippines' last Olympic medal was a silver won by Anthony
Villanueva in the featherweight division in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.
   With Tuesday's victory, the Serantes family should have fewer
financial worries. By clinching at least a bronze, Serantes is
assured of an $18,500 bonus from a group of Filipino businessmen.
   They have promised more if Serantes takes the gold medal.

   Two long-anticipated indictments accusing a private
network of illegally supplying mercenaries and arms to the Contras
steered clear of thorny questions about the group's links to the
Reagan administration or drug trafficking.
   The indictments also left other questions unanswered.
   Thirteen men are accused of having violated the U.S. Neutrality
Act by mounting an illegal campaign to help the Contras overthrow
the Sandinista government of Nicaragua.
   The defendants include the brother of a top Contra leader, the
head of the group called Civilian Materiel Assistance, and at least
two men reputed to have drug ties.
   The latest development in the case is the government's response,
filed Sept. 16, to defense contentions that the Neutrality Act does
not apply because the United States was effectively at war with
Nicaragua.
   But the U.S. attorney's office avoided confronting that issue
directly in its response, saying the matter should be decided in
trial, not during a special hearing requested by the defendants.
   Other unresolved issues include possible Reagan administration
oversight of the illegal activities, the question of drug ties to
the operation, the absence of key figures among those indicted and
the sluggish pace of the investigation, which covered events in
1984 and 1985.
   ``The biggest question is who were the people not indicted,''
says Jack Blum, special counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which is preparing a report on a parallel investigation.
   ``They are prosecuting the weakest players who, by and large,
were not the movers,'' Blum said. For example, he notes, testimony
from his committee traced connections between CMA, former National
Security Council aide Oliver North and military intelligence, but
the indictment stopped with CMA head Tom Posey.
   Two of the men who were indicted, ex-mercenary Jack Terrell and
Joe Adams, were the most candid witnesses before prosecutors and
congressional committees, he notes. They and other defendants claim
they were working with the knowledge and cooperation of the
government.
   Interim U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen has indicated that issues
involving North and other higher-ups in the Reagan administration
are in the hands of the Independent Counsel's office in Washington.
   Lehtinen's assistant, Richard Gregorie, said that when some
names came up in their investigation, the special prosecutor told
the Miami office that the subjects had immunity.
   Jim Wieghart, Washington spokesman for Iran-Contra special
prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, confirms their investigation continues,
although by law he cannot comment on its targets. He noted that
Walsh's mandate does not include Neutrality Act violations, the
basis of the Fort Lauderdale indictments.
   A key figure missing from the indictment is John Hull, a U.S.
citizen whose Costa Rican ranch was identified by congressional
witnesses as a base for military operations against neighboring
Nicaragua _ as well as a waystation for cocaine traffickers.
   The indictments do mention a March 1985 arms run to Costa Rica
that congressional witnesses testified went to Hull's ranch. But
the indictments never identify the shipment's destination or
mention Hull.
   There have been reports that Hull was granted immunity by the
special prosecutor.
   ``I would be extremely upset if that were true,'' Blum said.
``Witnesses say Hull was all over the place in this case.''
   Convicted cocaine pilot Gary Betzner has testified Hull once met
his plane when it landed on the ranch to exchange Contra arms for
Colombian cocaine.
   Hull has strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking, but
has acknowledged supporting the Contras.
   One man indicted, Eulalio Francisco ``Frank'' Castro, was
arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1983 for
allegedly smuggling 425,000 pounds of marijuana into the country.
But that charge was dropped in June 1984, the same month the
indictment says he began training Contra recruits near the Gulf
Coast community of Naples.
   U.S. Attorney Mark Schnapp said Castro financed the 60-man
training camp but refused to say if the money was drug-related.
   Gregorie said his office decided to ignore the numerous accounts
of witnesses who have testified to Congress and talked to the media
about the alleged arms-for-drugs runs.
   ``We had a duty to say whether their testimony was credible or
worthwhile,'' Gregorie said.
   Still plaguing prosecutors are accusations made a year ago that
then-U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner buckled under to then-Attorney
General Edwin Meese III's pressure to put the politically sensitive
case on hold. Congress investigated, but both men denied making a
key phone call and lawmakers could make no determination.

<HEAD>Rape Victim Drops Efforts To Collect $2.56 Million From Destitute
Attacker</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs grafs 11 through end with 5 grafs to UPDATE with
Singleton telling police he does not plan to stay in Pinole, Calif.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A rape victim whose attacker cut off her
arms with an ax has reluctantly given up efforts to collect a $2.56
million judgment from the man after he revealed he is nearly broke,
her lawyer said.
   And yet another community is trying to get rid of convicted
rapist Lawrence Singleton, who set off a public furor in several
northern California communities where he attempted to live after
being released from prison earlier this year.
   Mary Vincent won a $2.56 million civil judgment in a Nevada
court against Singleton earlier this year over the 1978 attack.
   However, her attorney, Mark Edwards of Tustin, a Los Angeles
suburb, said Monday that Singleton told him during a
deposition-taking in a San Francisco hotel last weekend that his
only income is a $600-per-month Social Security check.
   Singleton has only about $200 in the bank, is unemployed, is
disabled by kidney problems, owns no property, and has not sold the
movie, book or television rights to his story, Edwards said.
   ```I guess I am going to have to give up on collecting this
judgment for the time being, but in my heart I am not going to let
it go,''' Edwards quoted Ms. Vincent as saying.
   Ms. Vincent is married and lives in the Pacific Northwest. She
was 15 when Singleton picked her up while she was hitchhiking and
raped her and hacked off her forearms.
   Edwards said he was contacted informally by Singleton's
attorneys who offered to set up the deposition hearing.
   Edwards promised not to reveal information about the deposition
for at least 48 hours after it was held, to allow Singleton time to
return to his out-of-state home. He also agreed not to reveal where
Singleton is living.
   But in Pinole, 30 miles east of San Francisco, Police Chief Ted
Barnes told the city council Monday night that Singleton had been
living there for several days.
   ``He has some personal matters to take care of, and once he's
taken care of them, he says he's moving on,'' Barnes said Tuesday.
   Before police learned that Singleton did not plan to stay in the
town, Mayor Phil Green had said, ``I don't want to have this guy in
our town for 30 seconds.'' He promised Singleton would be banished
``if we have to call in the National Guard.''
   Councilman Roy Swearingen also had called for Singleton to move
on, but cautioned the community not to overreact.
   ``This man is hated by everyone,'' he said. ``I'm concerned that
there will be some kind of violent act.''
   Earlier this year, Singleton had been living in Tampa, Fla.

<TEXT>
   With the fighting fast and furious on
the Olympic fields, the rice paddies of Panmunjom seem eerily calm.
   On this no-man's land in limbo between South and North Korea,
just an hour's ride from Seoul, the battle being waged is one of
symbols.
   The only clear signs of the momentous sports gathering 30 miles
away is an Olympic flag taunting North Korea and the signature of
Olympic swimming star Matt Biondi in the visitors' book at Camp
Bonifas, the forward U.N. command at the Demilitarized Zone.
   More than halfway through the Olympics, fears of an attack by
North Korea against the Games have receded.
   In fact, the communist North, which had sought to co-host the
games with its archrival, appears to be studiously ignoring the
international sports meet.
   ``They haven't even attacked the Games in their propaganda,''
said U.S. Air Force Capt. David Griffard, who serves with the U.N.
command.
   Griffard is one of 375 people stationed at Camp Bonifas,
adjacent to the site of Quonset huts where regular meetings are
held with the North to discuss violations of the 1953 armistice
agreement that ended the three-year Korean War.
   Since the Olympics began, most of the commentary from the
North's loudspeakers focuses on the disappointment of South Korean
students that the Games were not being held jointly in Seoul and
Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, he said.
   Radical South Korean students, seeking unification with the
North, staged violent protests against the Olympics in the months
leading up to the Games, but their demonstrations have declined
since the competitions began last week.
   The men of Camp Bonifas, about half of whom are South Koreans,
have also noticed that the North is cranking up its loudspeaker
music a little more for the constant stream of tourists visiting
the DMZ.
   The blasts of music _ a mixture of oriental and Western tunes _
are sometimes accompanied by praise for ruler Kim Il Sung and
exhortations to South Koreans to defect.
   But the South's propaganda machine is just as persistent as the
North's.
   The South Koreans are encouraging visitors and reporters to take
the opportunity to tour Panmunjom, making this the hottest
attraction after the Games.
   As many as 18 tour buses a day cross the narrow wood-planked
Freedom Bridge spanning the mine-strewn Imjin River and leading to
the DMZ. Tours offered to reporters and photographers covering the
Olympics are booked days in advance.
   The visit begins with a 25-minute slide presentation,
accompanied by a profusion of facts and figures about the DMZ
rattled off by a U.S. officer:
   Symbols abound. The Americans call the mostly uninhabited Gijung
Dong ``propaganda village.'' The pagoda-like building which serves
as headquarters for the U.S. and South Korean armistice officers is
known as Freedom House.
   Less than 100 yards away, North Korean soldiers snap photos of
the visiting reporters and peer at them through binoculars. ``Don't
make any gestures to them,'' the media group is warned.
   Visitors must be dressed properly _ no jeans, shorts or
sneakers: ``We don't want them to think we're decadent,'' says Lt.
Robert Feliu, accompanying the group.
   The troops who patrol the zone must be over 6 feet tall and over
180 pounds in weight. The North Koreans tend to be shorter. ``The
purpose is intimidation, pure intimidation,'' says Feliu.
   In the battle of North-South oneupmanship, as on the Olympic
fields, every inch counts.
   So when the North raised its flag pole to 330 feet, the South
followed suit, although the North has since upped it to 528 feet,
and the South has yet to match it.
   North Korea's headquarters building in the Joint Security Area,
where the armistice talks are held, is about a yard higher and
longer than the adjacent U.N. headquarters, says Cpl. Dale
Adkinson, another military explainer. ``But it's much narrower than
ours,'' Adkinson adds with satisfaction.
   The U.S. and South Korean troops at the DMZ are ever at the
ready. Nothing special for the Olympics, says Adkinson.
   So on an autumn day in Panmunjom, the men feel as bored as ever.
The only highlight of their day is the Olympic competition being
beamed to them from Seoul, one hour and a world away.

   For those accustomed to turgid Soviet
speeches on Marxist theory, class struggle, imperialism, oppression
of the Third World and East-West confrontation, it was a revolution.
   When Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze took the rostrum at
the 43rd U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, he sounded more pacific,
pragmatic, and ecologically sensitive than Soviet officials have
sounded for years.
   Who ever thought of the ozone layer as a major Soviet concern?
If one closed his eyes and listened to the English-language
translation, one might not have recognized the Kremlin's top
foreign policy spokesman.
   Shevardnadze proclaimed ``our vision of peaceful coexistence as
the universal principle of international relations.'' Class
struggle in the international arena is out, he said, and ideology
is not a practical basis for conducting international relations.
   There was more. The senior Soviet diplomat even spoke of ``holes
burned in the ozone layer'' and the greenhouse effect of global
warming. He lamented acid rain, erosion of the biosphere, dying
seas and fauna. He devoted far more time and passion to
``aggression against nature'' than to arms control and long-range
nuclear weapons.
   ``We need resources to save our planet, instead of destroying
it,'' he said.
   Gone were the litany of U.S.-Soviet problems and irritations,
the stark cataloging of world problems, declarations on the Middle
East.
   ``It truly was a revolutionary speech, an important statement of
Soviet philosophy in foreign relations,'' said Iraqi Ambassador
Ismat Kittani, a veteran U.N. diplomat. ``It was especially
significant for its tone and style, as well as its content, for
what was unsaid as well as what was spoken,'' he added.
   Kittani and many other U.N. diplomats pointed to Shevardnadze's
references to peaceful coexistence, ridding foreign policy of
ideology and improved Soviet-U.S. relations which benefit the world.
   The extensive references to the environment took many observers
by surprise. The urgency of Shevardnadze's tone in addressing the
globe's ecological problems rivaled his past elaborations of the
horrors of nuclear war.
   ``Faced with the threat of environmental catastrophe,'' he said,
``the dividing lines of the bipolar ideological world are receding.
The biosphere recognizes no division into blocs, alliances or
systems.
   ``All share the same climatic system, and no one is in a
position to build his own isolated and independent line of
environmental defense.''
   It is more sensible, he said, to abolish some military programs
and channel funds into fighting environmental problems.
   Shevardnadze's third speech to the General Assembly since he was
named foreign minister emphasized what he called ``new political
thinking.'' It followed by one day the seventh and last address of
President Reagan to the 159-member world body.
   Reagan, while repeating his annual lectures on the superiority
of U.S. democracy and free enterprise, also was significantly more
conciliatory than in the past.
   In contrast to previous years, he limited his specific criticism
of the Soviet Union to passing references to its human rights
practices, and he praised the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   But it was Shevardnadze's speech, devoid of the hard news and
headlines that attract reporters, that showed the most far-reaching
reassessments in political thinking, an evolution of the changing
Soviet position over the past few years since Mikhail S. Gorbachev
took over as Kremlin leader.
   It was a watershed. How far the Soviets have come from the
shoe-pounding days of 1960, when Nikita Khrushchev fulminated
against the West.
   Shevardnadze also repeated his calls for strengthening the
United Nations. He said that while safeguarding their sovereignty,
nations should subordinate some interests to the international
purpose of peace and to world forums.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE HMS STOCKHOLM, Baltic Sea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ensign Karin
Berglund explained as she navigated this Swedish missile carrier
through a treacherous Baltic archipelago that she's just a sailor
``like everybody else on board.''
   ``I've always been interested in sailing and the sea, and I
couldn't find anything I wanted to do more than go into the navy,''
said the 25-year-old officer, seated at a bank of radar screens and
navigation maps on the bridge. ``I don't see myself as a woman in
the navy. I'm just one of the crew.''
   She is one of three women _ the only woman officer _ in the
32-member crew of the HMS Stockholm, a 330-ton corvette serving as
the flagship of Sweden's hard-pressed anti-submarine warfare unit.
   For a nation once considered a leader of the sexual revolution,
professional military service for women came late. Sweden's officer
corps were opened to women only in 1980.
   Military life still attracts few females, and many of them use
their military training in technical professions to move into
higher paid civilian careers.
   Defense Ministry figures say 114 women are among the 16,000
officers in the standing and reserve services of all branches. The
highest ranking officer is Col. Anne-Marie Goransson, a surgeon in
the medical corps.
   Women are not drafted as men are but have served since early
this century in auxiliary units as cooks, cleaners or drivers. More
than 50,000 women belong to these units today.
   ``Having girls on board has changed the way the men behave.
They're much more civilized than they were,'' said Cmdr. Lennart
Danielsson, who has women in his compliment for the first time this
year.
   Unlike many ships, no pinups grace the walls of the enlisted
crew quarters, where two women sleep among 12 men. There are no
curtains or special facilities, but the women don't seem to mind.
   ``It took a week or so to get used to, but then it was so
natural,'' said Sgt. Ewa Kroog, a 20-year-old signals operator.
   Kroog said she adjusted to a male environment during basic
training and in her signals course, when she was bunked in a room
with five other women in an otherwise all-male barracks.
   ``Of course the first week you took the towel into the shower
with you, but after that you don't think about it. You get used to
it very fast,'' she said.
   Once on board ship, she said, ``It was the guys who had
problems. I knew what I was getting into when I decided to go into
the navy. The guys didn't beg to have girls here.''
   Officers normally sleep in two-man cabins, which could have been
problematic for Berglund, her skipper said. Danielsson assigned her
to a four-bunk cabin to avoid gossip.
   Shipboard romances were out, said Kroog, who has a boyfriend on
another ship. ``It must be all business, otherwise it wouldn't work
down here.''
   The navy and air force have been more successful absorbing women
than the army, which issued a report last year that women were
performing badly in the artillery and engineering corps. But they
often do better than men in services requiring technical ability,
the report said.
   The report recommended that women remain barred from the
cavalry, armored corps and infantry, which it said were physically
too demanding. The air force has no women pilots.
   ``There is something unnatural about young girls lifting heavy
gun carriages or running with heavy weapons,'' the army commander,
Lt. Gen. Erik Bengtsson, said in a newspaper interview last year
and later came under heavy criticism for saying it.
   In the navy, women are not allowed to serve in submarines or as
naval commandos, where deep sea pressure could cause miscarriages
in pregnant sailors.

   Here are day-by-day highlights of
the flight of Discovery on the 26th space shuttle mission scheduled
for launch Thursday:
   Day One:
   Launch set for 9:59 a.m. EDT. Six hours, 12 minutes after
launch, during the fifth orbit, astronauts release a Tracking and
Data Relay Satellite from the cargo bay. Activate experiments to
process materials and to study the effect of weightlessness on red
blood cells and organic materials.
   Day Two:
   Continue previous experiments and start others that examine the
influence of weightlessness on crystals and other substances,
photograph lightning in the atmosphere and demonstrate the
feasibility of using infrared communications links in space.
   Day Three:
   Continue experiments. Photograph the horizon ``twilight glow''
before sunrise and after sunset. Practice reentry procedures,
includig donning pressure suits and setting up a telescoping pole
that the astronauts would slide down if they had to bail out during
gliding flight on an aborted landing attempt.
   Day Four:
   Astronauts hold an in-flight news conference, answering
questions submitted by reporters covering the mission. Deactivate
experiments, stow equipment and check flight control systems in
preparation for return to Earth.
   Day Five:
   Fire deorbit engines and start an hourlong descent, with landing
at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., set for 7:55 a.m. PDT on Monday,
after a flight of 4 days 55 minutes.

<HEAD>Government Calls For Frugal National Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer flowers and no officially-sanctioned
fireworks will grace China's National Day on Oct. 1 this year.
   The Beijing government, currently trying to rein in public
sector overspending that is emptying the treasury and fueling
inflation, has announced that frugality must rule in celebrating
the 39th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China.
   The official China Daily today quoted Beijing officials as
saying there will be 340,000 fewer potted plants in the flower
display traditionally set up in central Tiananmen Square for the
national holiday.
   No official fireworks will be set off, although lasers will be
used to ``create an atmosphere,'' the daily said.
   Government and party leaders will gather at the Great Hall of
the People Friday evening for a reception, but no other organized
parties and entertainment programs in the hall will be allowed.
   The report said Shanghai and Fujian province have banned all
festival dinner parties using public funds, and the government has
ordered state units against ``reckless'' distribution of
unauthorized bonuses, subsidies, allowances and food.
   The daily said there will be more meat, poultry and eggs
available this year for residents in Beijing, Shanghai and other
large cities to celebrate at home.
   The Beijing government recently has imposed taxes on official
banquets, banned gift-giving by officials and ordered cutbacks in
purchases of cars and other consumer items as part of a campaign to
combat out-of-control spending by public offices.
   Chinese workers receive three days off for National Day, and the
streets are lined with chrysanthemums and other flowers. This year
many are arranged to depict dragons to mark the Year of the Dragon.
   In Tiananmen Square, besides the flower displays, workers are
erecting portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin which go up
every National Day and May Day.

<HEAD>U.S. Track Athlete Arrested For Kicking Taxi</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Olympic runner Johnny L. Gray was
arrested for kicking a taxi and is the third American athlete to be
detained for unruly behavior in the past week, police said today.
   Authorities said Gray was seized by police after he became
involved in an argument with a taxi driver Tuesday night.
   The driver said he blew his horn at Gray because the runner was
blocking the road. Gray kicked the taxi and then tried to flee, but
was caught by police, authorities said.
   Gray was questioned at a police station, then released in the
custody of U.S. Embassy officials, police said.
   Ron Rowan, an attorney for the U.S. Olympic Committee, said Gray
and three unidentified companions complained that the cab was
driving dangerously and almost hit them. Gray was acting in
self-defense, Rowan said.
   The taxi driver chased the Americans with an object that
appeared to be a tire iron, but did not hit anyone before police
intervened and detained Gray, Rowan said.
   Rowan said the driver had been compensated for the damage.
   The case was forwarded to the Public Prosecutor for possible
action on charges of violent assault, police said. But the case was
considered minor and it was unlikely that any major action would be
taken against Gray, a police officer said.
   Gray finished fifth in the 800-meter run. He won the U.S.
Olympic trials in the event and was national champion in 1985, 1986
and 1987.
   Police were to forward to the prosecutor today their report the
arrest Saturday of U.S. Olympic gold medalist swimmers Troy Dalbey
and Doug Gjertsen after a marble carving was removed from a Seoul
hotel.
   Dalbey and Gjertsen apologized for the incident Tuesday.
   Police officials said no special consideration was being given
to the American athletes, but they indicated they did not expect
charges to be pressed.
   There have been no reports of athletes from other countries
being arrested.
   A series of incidents involving U.S. Olympic team members has
triggered a wave of criticism in the South Korean media and among
some Koreans.
   Newspapers have charged Americans are rude and arrogant and have
failed to behave properly during their stay in Seoul.
   Much of the criticism appears to be part of attempts to deflect
attention from an incident last week in which South Korean boxing
officials attacked a referee after he awarded a decision to a
Bulgarian boxer over a local favorite.
   That case is also under investigation by police, but there has
been no statement on how the probe is proceeding and the case is
rarely mentioned by the local press.

   Julie Lynn Guptill-Gilbert, 20, will have to wear the sign when
she goes out in public, although she did not have to wear it out of
the King County Courthouse on Tuesday.
   She pleaded guilty in March to two counts of communicating with
a minor for immoral purposes in incidents involving two 4-year-old
girls when Ms. Guptill-Gilber was working at a preschool in Bothell.
   At the time, Superior Court Judge Warren Chan gave her the
choice of wearing the sign for 60 days or spending 30 days in jail.
She chose the sign.
   Ms. Guptill-Gilbert said nothing at a hearing Tuesday, when she
was given the foot-long, 4-inch wide, county-made sign.
   She will have to wear it for only 33 days because of time
already served.
   Her sentence amounts to house arrest because she plans to stay
with relatives in Monroe, said county prosecutor's spokesman Dan
Donohue.

   Ed Flanders, who played a compassionate
hospital administrator on television's ``St. Elsewhere,'' was
hospitalized in guarded condition after his car plunged down a
400-foot embankment, officials said.
   The 53-year-old actor was driving near the northern California
town of Salyer when his convertible left the road and went down the
hill Monday, said Highway Patrol Sgt. Vern Crogh. Flanders was
ejected from the car.
   He was taken to Mad River Community Hospital with head and chest
injuries and was in guarded condition in the intensive care unit
Tuesday, a nursing supervisor said.
   Flanders played the kind-hearted but self-righteous Dr. Donald
Westphall on ``St. Elsewhere.''
   The character left the series in October 1987 with a flourish,
by exposing his rear end to a character playing an executive of a
health organization that had taken over St. Eligius Hospital.
   When Flanders returned for the filming of the nostalgic final
show of the six-year series, he upset producers by refusing to
stick to his lines and instead delivered a rambling speech on death.

   Fawn Hall, who gained fame as
ex-Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North's loyal secretary, is writing an
autobiography at age 28 about growing up in a family of career
civil servants, according to her agent. Miss Hall's book will be
published by Warner Books in late 1989, William Morris Agency
executive Norman Brokaw said Tuesday. Brokaw did not disclose the
terms of the deal with the New York-based publisher.
   Miss Hall made headlines with her testimony before a
congressional hearing into the Iran-Contra scandal about how she
shredded and altered documents about arms deals.
   She has been working on her autobiography at a Malibu beach
house, Brokaw said.
   Since taking a leave of absence from the government, she has
signed with Brokaw and has appeared on ABC-TV's ``Barbara Walters
Special'' and was the co-host of the syndicated talk show ``Hour
Magazine'' with Gary Collins.
   ``Miss Hall's book will be about life growing up in a family
where both mother and father have been dedicated throughout the
years to working in the service of the U.S. government, inspiring
her to follow in their footsteps,'' Brokaw said.
   Miss Hall, a government employee for 10 years, will have plenty
to say about life on a federal payroll, Brokaw said.

   Montand left a bouquet of red carnations Tuesday at the
working-class chapel and residence, where the Rev. Andre Jarlan was

repressing street demonstrations against President Augusto Pinochet.
   ``They killed him without asking if he was French or Chilean,''
Montand, using a bullhorn, told a crowd gathered outside the home
Tuesday. ``They killed him because he was convinced we can change
things and give this country, like so many other countries where
men and women are exploited, the possibility of expressing
themselves in democracy and with respect for human rights.''

   The United States should not rule out the
possibility of negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of
American hostages, former CIA director Stansfield Turner said
Tuesday.
   Turner, speaking at the University of Kentucky, said negotiation
should be considered as a possible response to terrorism, along
with force.
   Referring to Sunday's presidential debate between Vice President
George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, during which
both seemed to rule out negotiating with terrorists, Turner said,
``The candidates said what they had to say.''
   ``They don't want to advertise to the terrorists that they're
going to make deals if it's absolutely necessary,'' he said. ``As
we hear that rhetoric we should be prepared for more deals to occur.
   ``I happen to think, without any inside information, that
there's one cooking today between Iran and ourselves over the nine
Americans being held in Beirut,'' Turner said.
   Turner, a Navy admiral who served as CIA director during the
administration of Jimmy Carter, spoke to an audience of about 150
in an appearance sponsored by UK's Patterson School of Diplomacy
and International Commerce.

   Two of the nation's busiest polling
organizations have worked in near-secrecy this election year,
harvesting opinion, analyzing it, carefully shielding it from
prying eyes. They are not out to make news.
   They are out to win the White House.
   ``We do states. We do the nation. We interpret the data and we
make recommendations on the basis of it,'' said Irwin ``Tubby''
Harrison, pollster for the Dukakis campaign. ``There is a high
level of interest.''
   ``We're doing the obvious things: a few national polls, a lot of
statewide polls,'' said Robert Teeter, his counterpart in the Bush
campaign. ``Quite a lot of statewide polls. ... It all depends on
what the current problem is.''
   The problem is not lack of effort. Each of these men has more
than 100 interviewers working the phones every day, more added for
special projects. Each has a hefty budget and a keenly interested,
if private, audience.
   Neither likes to discuss his results publicly. But the effect of
their work can be seen every day: In many ways, polls are setting
the agenda in the campaign for the presidency.
   ``Polling is a major part of the campaign decision-making
apparatus,'' said pollster Peter Hart, head of Walter Mondale's
polling operation in the 1984 election. ``It affects everything
from scheduling to advertising to the very basic message components
of a campaign.''
   His old nemesis, President Reagan's pollster, Richard Wirthlin,
agreed: ``To understand what public attitudes are _ not necessarily
who's ahead and behind _ is the grist that drives the strategic
mill of the campaign.''
   This year, the effects could not be clearer. Polls have put
Michael Dukakis in a tank, George Bush in a flag factory and day
care on page one. They have encouraged sharp Democratic criticism
of Bush's choice for vice president and a soft Republican line on
Dukakis' running mate.
   Behind nearly every strategic move lies a poll. ``You have a
choice,'' said Hart. ``You can either make your decisions on the
basis of your best guess _ or on the basis of solid information
from polling.''
   As a result, each campaign may spend up to $2 million on general
election polling, Hart said. ``It will probably only turn out to be
3 percent of the total campaign budget. But that 3 percent drives
the other 97 percent.''
   Polling long has been a marketing tool in business, and its role
is much the same in a campaign. By testing themes, polltakers can
tell which issues hit the mark; by testing popularity, they can
focus efforts on the states where their chances are best.
   ``You have a limited number of resources, a limited amount of
time and a limited amount of candidates,'' said Teeter. ``You're
trying to figure out how to use those resources the best way you
can to have the greatest influence on the election.''
   For example, the Bush campaign polled heavily before the Super
Tuesday regional primary to decide where to spend advertising money
and send the candidate. Said Teeter: ``Do we spend time in Florida
or North Carolina?'' His polls found Bush already had Florida
locked up. ``We went to North Carolina.'' Bush won there, too.
   At this stage of the general election campaign, the approach is
more tuned to broader issues and themes. Among them:
   _Polls this summer showed Bush's support lagging among women.
Bush, not vociferous on the issue before, visited a Virginia
day-care center and proposed tax credits to help pay for child
care. He lags less with women now.
   _Polls consistently have found public doubt about Dukakis on
defense. Last month he climbed aboard a tank in a photo opportunity
meant to improve his image on the issue, and a subsequent poll
showed that the effort backfired. He also said he supported
research into the popular Strategic Defense Initiative, which
earlier he had called ``a fantasy,''
   _Polls have found public agreement with laws requiring teachers
to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance, and Bush has
continued to hammer Dukakis for vetoing such legislation on
constitutional grounds.
   _Polls also have found disquiet with the qualifications of
Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana. Dukakis brings up
the issue regularly, and hit it hard in his debate Sunday with Bush.
   Applying polls to campaign strategy can require more detailed
analysis. When Bush was considering possible running mates, for
example, polls pointed to Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., on a simple
popularity basis. But Quayle was a better fit on underlying issues
_ among them, Bush's need to assert his independence from President
Reagan with a bold stroke of his own.
   Still, strategists are quick to stress that polls do not call
the shots. ``They are not all-determining,'' said Lee Atwater,
Bush's campaign manager. ``It's good to have the data to help you
make the decisions. But it's also helpful to have pros who know the
flora and fauna out there.''
   Hesitancy in the campaigns to discuss the role of polls stems
from a fear of charges of cynical candidate packaging. ``People
talk about politicians responding to the polls in a pejorative
sense,'' Atwater said.
   But in fact, he said, ``From a certain standpoint I guess that's
the way things ought to be done.'' Polls ``are a reflection of what
people want,'' he said. ``And politicians are supposed to respond
to what people want.''

<TEXT>
   Vice Presidential candidate Dan Quayle,
plunging into Lloyd Bentsen's home turf, didn't bother to mention
his Democratic counterpart but wasted no time in challenging
Bentsen's running mate, Michael Dukakis, to resign his membership
in the liberal American Civil Liberties Union.
   And while Bentsen has dual races _ his Senate re-election bid
and the vice presidential contest _ Quayle made it clear he also is
operating under a dual strategy: boosting the coffers of Bentsen's
Senate opponent and concentrating his firepower on Dukakis, not the
No. 2 player.
   Quayle has appearances today in El Paso, Amarillo and Dallas in
his second consecutive campaign day in Texas, a critical state with
29 electoral votes.
   At a Houston rally Tuesday, Quayle called on Dukakis to send
back his ACLU membership card.
   ``Let him renounce all their bizarre positions,'' Quayle said.
   The Republicans have attacked Dukakis for being a
``card-carrying member'' of the organization, and Republican George
Bush raised the issue in his debate Sunday with Dukakis, whom he
attempted to portray as a liberal out of touch with mainstream
views.
   Quayle said that the ACLU policy guide includes such positions
as removing the words ``In God We Trust'' from U.S. currency, and
that the organization has argued for legalizing prostitution and
drugs and advocates abortion on demand.
   The ACLU has disputed characterizations made by Bush, and a
spokeswoman for the group said Tuesday that Quayle and Bush were
``simplifying and misstating at the same time what we do and
believe in.''
   Colleen O'Connor said the ACLU believes the focus in dealing
with drug users should be on education and rehabilitation, rather
than punishment. A similar approach would work with prostitutes,
she said. Decriminalization of both, she said, would remove the
profiteering and thus the availability.
   Dukakis aides, seeking to distance the candidate from the
organization, have noted that the ACLU has filed lawsuits against
Dukakis as governor of Massachusetts over his plans to use
roadblocks to catch drunken drivers and a policy effectively
barring homosexuals from becoming foster parents.
   At an El Paso rally, Quayle said Dukakis can, by resigning, show
``without waffling, without backsliding, without the famous Dukakis
shuffle ... that he repudiates all the outrageous positions of the
ACLU.''
   This is Quayle's first campaign appearance in Texas as the
Republican vice presidential nominee. Bush and Bentsen both call
Texas home, and the Texas senator has spent considerable time in
the state campaigning not only for the national ticket but also for
his Senate re-election bid.
   Under a Texas law passed for Lyndon B. Johnson, Bentsen is
allowed to run for the Senate while also seeking national office.
   Quayle is attending fund-raisers in the state for Bentsen's
senate opponent, Rep. Beau Boulter, who is far behind in that
contest.
   Charles Black, a senior Bush strategist traveling with Quayle,
said Quayle's Texas appearances were designed to tie Bentsen down
and ``make sure Boulter has a few resources and Bentsen has to
focus on the Senate race.''
   Texas is one of nine states the Republicans have targeted as
swing states that could help provide the margin of victory
nationally.
   Black said Quayle's job in the state is to ``reinforce contrasts
between Bush and Dukakis on the issues,'' rather than attacking
Bentsen directly.
   In fact, Quayle was quoted in one newspaper interview Tuesday as
saying Bentsen ``has been a good senator'' and he called him ``a
real gentleman.''
   ``As a matter of fact, I want him to stay in the Senate,''
Quayle told the Houston Chronicle.
   Asked whether that statement meant Quayle did not really support
Boulter's challenge to Bentsen, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi
said, ``He means that the Bush-Quayle ticket will be victorious.''

   The Soviet Union handed the United
States only its second defeat ever in men's Olympic basketball
Wednesday, denying the Americans any chance of a gold medal.
   The Soviets held off a final American rally to win 82-76 in
their first matchup since the 1972 Olympic games in Munich.
   The Americans did get within three with three seconds to go, but
a free throw one second later left the Soviets exchanging high
fives and the Americans holding their heads in their hands.
   The Soviets dictated the tempo of the game, held Danny Manning,
the college player of the year from Kansas, to no points and never
allowed the U.S. team's pressure defense to take control.
   The Soviets will face the winner of Wednesday's
Yugoslavia-Australia semifinal for the gold medal Friday, a rematch
of the first-round game won by the Yugoslavs.
   The United States, now 85-2 in Olympic basketball and 6-1 this
year, will face the Yugoslavia-Australia loser for the bronze medal
Thursday.
   In 1972 at Munich, the United States suffered its first-ever
Olympic basketball defeat, 51-50, when officiating problems and
scoreboard malfunctions gave the Soviet Union three chances to
score the winning basket with one second to play.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
believes it is ``in the Western interest'' for Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev to succeed in restructuring the Soviet Union's
economy and increasing social freedoms.
   In an interview published in Wednesday's New York Times,
Thatcher said that what she likes about Gorbachev's approach ``is
the idea that enlarging the liberty and responsibility will give
you the greater economic prosperity.''
   Thatcher said that when she visited the Soviet Union last year,
``I had to decide whether I thought it was in the Western interest
that he succeed. And I think it is.''
   Of Gorbachev's efforts, she said: ``It's a great, massive
turnaround, where you have in fact been saying to people for 70
years, you don't do anything unless you've got permission, to turn
round and say, well now, look you've got to do quite a lot on your
own initiative.''
   Thatcher said Britain would support the changes in the Soviet
Union ``in every way we can without interfering.'' She cited an
increase in East-West contacts and in joint ventures between Soviet
state enterprises and British companies.
   But she also said that this uncertain period of change in the
Eastern bloc ``requires total Western unity and preparedness.''
   She said Britain would insist that the NATO alliance modernize
conventional and nuclear weapons in Western Europe.
   Thatcher said she hadn't watched the debate between presidential
candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis.
   ``I'm not going to get involved in your election problems for
very obvious reasons,'' she said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Elections Loom Large Over Congressional Agenda</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the 100th Congress rushes toward
adjournment, it finds itself increasingly tangled in election-year
politics and the presidential campaigns of George Bush and Michael
Dukakis.
   Even the tamest bill can find itself held hostage to political
fortune and partisan campaigning.
   Proposals that have languished for years suddenly have new life
breathed into them by lawmakers with an eye on politics, home
district polls and opponents' press releases.
   No single issue more sums up the election-year mood of Congress
than the drug bill passed last week by the House and now pending in
the Senate. As Bush and Dukakis accused each other of being soft on
drug dealers and crime, Republicans and Democrats in the House
scrambled madly, clamoring to lead the charge in a War on Drugs.
   The vote was a whopping 375-30 for a package of anti-drug
provisions that even sponsors say may be unconstitutional. ``If
this bill becomes law, Americans will be less free,'' said Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House civil rights subcommittee.
   But another Democrat, Charles Rangel of New York, expressed the
feelings of the majority. While the bill is flawed, he said, ``at
least all of us can go home'' and say ``we responded to our
constituents and the nation.''
   With all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats up on Election Day,
going home is just what Congress wants to do, and as soon as
possible.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas says Congress could
adjourn this week if it would simply pass the pending appropriation
bills and a few other relatively noncontroversial issues.
   Dole said many of the late-blooming issues should be left to the
presidential election campaign and its winner. ``We should
determine precisely what Governor Dukakis and the vice president
have in mind on these issues,'' Dole said. ``We will have plenty of
time next year to address each of them.''
   But Republicans and Democrats alike each have a political agenda
that could keep them in Washington well into October. Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., is telling colleagues to plan
on weekend work and a mid-October escape.
   What's keeping Congress in town? In addition to some money
bills, a bipartisan overhaul of the welfare system and other
issues, at least four partisan fights are running out the
election-year clock:
   _Minimum Wage. For five days, the Senate debated a proposal to
raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage hasn't been increased
since 1981, but Democrats brought this plan to the floor in the
final weeks of the two-year-long 100th Congress. Republicans
filibustered, saying the Democrats wouldn't get action on the
minimum wage unless they allowed Senate votes on two dozen Reagan
judicial nominations languishing in committee.
   Byrd pulled the minimum wage bill down, with both sides crying
dirty politics.
   Dole complained that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman
of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, was unleashing a flood
of liberal social legislation just before the elections.
   ``How many more bills are we going to get from Kennedy's
committee?'' Dole asked. He got his answer a few minutes later,
when the Senate turned to another Labor Committee proposal:
   _Family Leave. This bill would guarantee at least 10 weeks of
unpaid, job-protected leave to seriously ill workers and to those
with newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children. Dukakis
supports the plan; Bush says women shouldn't have to worry about
getting their jobs back after maternity leave but hasn't yet issued
a detailed proposal.
   _Taxes. This bill makes numerous technical corrections in the
big 1986 tax overhaul and also contains several tax breaks and the
relatively minor tax increases needed to pay for them.
   Harmless?
   In another year, it could be approved quickly and quietly. But
this time, each side has election-year jitters.
   The White House said this week it will support an amendment to
the bill that would deny tax exemptions to hospitals and clinics
that routinely perform abortions, guaranteeing a partisan fight
when and if it hits the floor.
   On the other side, Byrd is afraid Republicans might accuse
Democrats of raising taxes if they pass the bill.
   ``I'm just suspicious of this White House,'' Byrd said Tuesday.
He said he can see Reagan administration officials complaining
loudly, ```There they go, raising taxes. There the Democrats go.'''
   As a result, neither Democrats nor Republicans are going
anywhere until the need to campaign at home overcomes the urge to
campaign in Washington.

<TEXT>
   A Senate tax bill that for two years has been
gathering everything but momentum is now hung up over fears that
President Reagan will accuse its backers of favoring higher taxes.
   In comparison with the giant 1986 tax overhaul legislation,
which shifted $125 billion in taxes from individuals to
corporations over five years, this bill is peanuts, with a
three-year price tag of $2.3 billion.
   It was launched in the summer of 1986 just to correct errors and
clear up ambiguities in the new tax law. It since has become the
vehicle for dozens of other tax provisions whose beneficiaries
include farmers, workers who receive education assistance from
their employers, and taxpayers involved in disputes with the
Internal Revenue Service.
   To pay for those benefits, the bill would raise taxes by $2.3
billion, with most of the money coming from corporations.
   The Reagan administration has expressed support for some
provisions in the bill and reservations about others. But that is
not good enough for Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, who has
implied the Senate might not even consider the measure this year
unless the administration clears up the confusion.
   ``I'm just suspicious of this White House,'' Byrd told
colleagues Tuesday. He said he fears that once Congress passes the
bill, administration officials will pick up one of President
Reagan's campaign cries of the past: ``There they go raising taxes.
There the Democrats go.''
   ``It would be well if we could get some clear, unequivocal,
indubitably plain, well-understood statement from the White
House,'' Byrd said. ``I'm just concerned the White House will stand
on the sidelines and attack Congress on the tax bill.''
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was asked if the White
House will respond to Byrd's request.
   ``I think they have already responded,'' he replied. ``They
would support the Senate bill.''
   But Byrd said, ``We haven't gotten anything clear and
unambiguous from the White House.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who is managing the bill, said he is
convinced the White House supports it. ``They agree with the
revenue-raisers,'' he told reporters.
   The latest administration pronouncement on the bill, which came
from the White House Office of Management and Budget, added another
complication. It said the administration supports a proposed
amendment that would deny a tax exemption to any hospital or clinic
that performs abortions when the life of the mother is not
threatened.
   The OMB letter states: ``The federal government should not
subsidize abortion through an exemption in the tax code.''
   Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, Republican manager of the tax bill
and an opponent of federal restrictions on abortions, said he feels
confident that amendment can be defeated. He called the OMB
endorsement ``a throwaway to the right-to-lifers.''
   In 1986, when the tax overhaul was being written, Sens. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., and William Armstrong, R-Colo., blocked action on
that bill with a similar amendment. The obstacle was removed after
Reagan personally pleaded with the two senators, saying that while
he supported their goal, he feared the controversy could doom the
tax bill.
   Packwood, seeking to assure Byrd, said, ``The White House would
sign the Senate bill as it came out of the Senate Finance
Committee.'' But any bill that moved toward the House version would
be vetoed, he added.
   In comparison with the $2.3 billion cost of the Senate bill, the
House version would cost $7 billion over three years.
   Among dozens of provisions in the Senate bill are those to free
farmers and some other businesses from paying the federal tax on
diesel fuel used for off-road purposes; extend expiring tax
benefits for research, employer-financed education and legal aid,
and assistance for first-time home buyers; allow freelance writers
to deduct expenses before their works start making money; assure a
deduction for football fans who give to their alma mater and, in
return, are assured the privilege of buying season tickets.

<TEXT>
   Democrats and Republicans alike are praising a
sweeping welfare overhaul plan that would require some recipients
to work for their benefits, despite complaints from an advocacy
group that the measure would ``drop a bomb on the poor people of
America.''
   The compromise plan, approved Tuesday by House and Senate
negotiators, is billed as the most extensive welfare overhaul in 50
years. It immediately won praise from members of both parties
including President Reagan and Democratic vice presidential nominee
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   While workfare provisions aimed at welfare mothers provoked the
most dispute, the bill also aims to help welfare recipients help
themselves through a combination of training, education, support
services and stepped-up child support collections.
   House and Senate negotiators formally approved the compromise,
in the works all summer, on a 35-8 vote Tuesday evening. All nine
senators voted yes. Each chamber must approve the compromise before
it goes to the White House.
   Reagan, returning to the White House from New York, said he was
``very happy'' with the five-year, $3.34 billion measure, which
contains the workfare requirement upon which his administration had
insisted.
   The president's chief of staff, Kenneth Duberstein, said, ``Our
indications ... are that in fact it is in fact a good, strong
workfare requirement, which would meet the president's test.''
   The Reagan administration succeeded in winning a 16-hour-a-week
workfare requirement for one adult in two-parent households
receiving welfare. The provision affects only about 7 percent of
the caseload, would not kick in until recipients had undergone an
intensive two-month job search, and is not effective until 1994.
But conservatives were jubilant despite the conditions.
   ``That work requirement is indeed the nose of the camel under
the tent,'' said Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo. ``It is the beginning of
a different approach to welfare.''
   Deeply frustrated House opponents agreed with him, but branded
the requirement unfair to recipients and burdensome to states.
   ``It does not provide education or training to make welfare
recipients employable, and does not lead to permanent jobs,'' said
Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the Education and
Labor Committee. ``It is simply a punitive approach to forcing
people off the rolls.''
   Some House members also said mothers required to participate in
the work program would not receive sufficient child care help or
safety assurances under the bill. And they said people working off
their grants in public work programs could be paid the equivalent
of the minimum wage regardless of how much those working next to
them were making.
   But in the end many heeded the warning of Rep. Tom Downey,
D-N.Y., whose subcommittee had handled the original House welfare
bill, a much more lavish proposal costing twice as much as the
compromise.
   ``It's not as far as we'd like to go but it's as far as we're
going to get,'' Downey said, urging his colleagues not to pump up
welfare recipients with false hopes of a better bill to come.
   The conference chairmen expressed satisfaction with their
product.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, called the compromise ``far from perfect'' but
added, ``I am confident ... that the families who are trapped in
the cycle of poverty would tell us to give them a chance and pass
this bill.''
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill
would improve America's economic status as well as people's lives.
``You can't be internationally competitive if you have the number
of people on welfare that we have today,'' he said during a
campaign stop in Detroit.
   The National Governors Association and the American Public
Welfare Association supported the bill, but the National Welfare
Rights and Reform Union claimed it would ``drop a bomb on the poor
people of America'' by forcing mothers to work.
   The current welfare system, Aid to Families with Dependent
Children, serves 3.7 million families that include 7 million
children. The federal government pays out about $8.5 billion a year
in cash benefits under AFDC, established in 1938 as part of the
Social Security system.
   In addition to the work requirement, key elements of the new
plan include:
   _$600 million in federal money for a new Job Opportunities and
Basic Skills program in its first year, rising gradually to $1.3
billion in 1995. States would design their own JOBS programs and
contribute matching money toward them.
   _Parents with children under age 3, or age 1 at state option,
would be exempt from JOBS participation. States would have to be
serving 20 percent of eligible participants by 1995. Up to 400,000
people a year will be helped nationwide.
   _JOBS participants would receive transportation and child care
help. Welfare parents working their way off the rolls would qualify
for a year of transitional child care and Medicaid benefits. Up to
475,000 people are expected to continue working because of the
transitional help.
   _The 23 states that do not offer welfare benefits to two-parent
households would have to do so for at least six months of each year
starting in fiscal 1991. That would add 65,000 families to the
rolls.
   _States would have to step up child support collections from
non-custodial parents, including tougher paternity determination
requirements and mandatory wage withholding upon the court award of
support payments.
   _The expense of the bill would be subsidized through a variety
of tax moves including reducing the dependent care credit for
higher income people and making permanent the Internal Revenue
Service's debt collection program.

<TEXT>
   Ill-fated Continental Flight 1713 waited so
long before takeoff at Denver airport after a de-icing that its
wings accumulated enough new ice to hinder the jet's ability to
fly, federal investigators say.
   The findings of the National Transportation Safety Board,
released Tuesday, said the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 had been so
thoroughly de-iced that some of the de-icing fluid seeped into the
cabin.
   But because of poor visibility and, in part, confused radio
communications, the jetliner had to wait 27 minutes in a steady
snowfall before taking off for Boise, Idaho.
   It was airborne only a few seconds before crashing onto the
runway, killing 28 of the 82 people aboard.
   The NTSB report also said Lee Bruecher, the 26-year-old copilot
who was at the controls during takeoff, rotated the plane off the
runway too sharply, causing its nose to veer up at a high angle and
adding to its problems staying aloft.
   Among the dead were Bruecher and Capt. Frank Zvonek, 46, who had
failed to order the jet back to the de-icing pad contrary to
airline operating procedures, the safety board said in its final
report on the Nov. 15, 1987 accident.
   The board's findings were challenged by Continental Airlines,
which said the investigation had not shown specifically that ice
had accumulated on the wings of Flight 1713.
   The nearly yearlong investigation focused on the failure to
de-ice the aircraft a second time and on the experience and
training of Bruecher and Zvonek.
   Continental's operations manual required a plane to return to
the de-icing pad if it was delayed 20 or more minutes in the
conditions experienced in Denver that November day, investigators
said.
   The failure to de-ice has been the cause of two other major
aviation accidents in the past six years: the crash of an Air
Florida jet at Washington D.C. in 1982, killing 78 people, and the
crash of an Arrow Air charter flight full of U.S. soldiers in
Gander, Newfoundland, killing all 256 on board.
   The airline has all along maintained that the pilot of the
departing Continental jet lost control because of air currents _ a
phenomenon called a wake vortex _ from a Boeing 767 landing three
minutes earlier on a parallel runway. But the NTSB report said the
theory had been looked at and discounted because of the relative
position of the two planes when Flight 1713 began having problems.
   The safety board noted that Bruecher had never flown a DC-9 in
snowy conditions and had only 36 hours of flight time in jet
aircraft at the time of the crash. He had been hired by Continental
in the summer of l987 after accumulating about 3,180 hours of
flying in propeller aircraft.
   The board cited as a contributing factor in the accident ``the
absence of regulatory or management controls'' over the operations
of pilots with limited experience. While Bruecher had little
experience flying the DC-9, Zvonek was a ``high minimum'' captain
not authorized without special permission to land _ though he could
legally take off _ under the conditions encountered at Denver that
day.
   Zvonek had flown 12,125 hours in all aircraft, including 133
hours as a DC-9 copilot, but only 33 hours as a captain,
investigators said. The two pilots had never flown together before.
   According to the investigation, Bruecher had training problems
with propeller aircraft before going to Continental and in 1985 was
fired by an air taxi company after he failed three times to pass
his flight examination despite 30 hours of training.
   At the time, his examiner told the NTSB, other pilots passed the
exam after only half that much training and that Bruecher had
``chronic troubles,'' became disoriented and seemed ``unable to
cope with deviations from the routine.''
   A year later while at Rio Airlines, a Texas commuter carrier,
Bruecher failed a flight check for a more advanced aircraft and was
described by the examiner as ``being behind the airplane.''
   After Continental Airlines hired Bruecher in July 1987 he also
encountered difficulties during several sessions of his formal
simulator training for the DC-9. During one session in the
simulator he ``completely lost control of (the) aircraft with
engine out at 2,000 feet,'' said one Continental training report,
according to the NTSB.
   Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks said the airline was not aware
of the pilot's previous training problems. He said when inquiries
were made about his previous employment, ``everything we got was
terrific.''
   Hicks acknowledged that Bruecher had problems in one of his
training sessions in a simulator, but said he had performed well at
other times. Continental has maintained that he was properly
trained and qualified to fly the DC-9.

<HEAD>Senate Considering Job-Protected Medical, Parental Leave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has said ``yes'' to requiring plant
closing notifications and ``no'' to raising the minimum wage. Now
it is weighing whether businesses should be forced to offer
employees job-protected medical and parental leave.
   The proposed leave act would require employers to offer at least
10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to workers with newborn,
newly adopted or seriously ill children, or who are seriously ill
themselves. Companies with fewer than 50 workers would be exempt.
   The Reagan administration said Tuesday that employers should be
encouraged _ but not required _ to respond to family needs of this
kind, and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said he would propose a tax
incentive amendment reflecting that aim.
   Pending when the Senate shut down Tuesday was an amendment to
tighten laws and stiffen penalties in the areas of child
pornography and obscenity.
   The leave act sponsored by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
required at least 13 weeks of medical leave and exempted only firms
of under 20 when it first came to the floor. Dodd on Tuesday
offered the substitute to reduce the leave time and the number of
companies involved, saying he was particularly concerned about big,
impersonal businesses where bosses are not familiar with their
workers' lives.
   The revisions, approved by voice vote, mean only 5 percent of
U.S. companies would be affected and it would cost them $2.67 per
year per covered employee _ a total of about $160 million, Dodd
said.
   ``All this legislation says is that for 10 weeks every two
years, if you're confronted with a crisis, you don't lose your
job,'' Dodd said. ``I don't consider that to be an unreasonable
idea. I think it's human decency. I think it's common sense.''
   Congressional Democrats, after a protracted battle, managed to
force the administration's hand and enact a bill requiring
companies to notify workers in advance of mass layoffs or plant
shutdowns. But the same forces, trying to raise the minimum wage,
were defeated this week by a conservative-led filibuster in the
Senate.
   Many moderates and conservatives called parental leave an
important benefit but fretted about the burden it would place on
employers.
   ``I have grave concerns about the negative effects on our
economy'' that the bill could cause, said Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M. ``We can feel real concern for those who want to spend time
with a seriously ill child. I have eight children myself and I'm
inclined to support some kind of compromise on this bill.''
   Cochran branded the requirement ``a very drastic departure from
current practice, and it is not really necessary in trying to deal
with the needs of a diverse and changing workforce. ... We should
all be concerned about the impact it may have on other benefits
that may be available.''
   The Reagan administration issued a policy statement Tuesday
saying the president's advisers would recommend a veto of the Dodd
bill in its present form.
   ``The administration would support a proposal for parental leave
which encourages employers and employees to agree on the leave
policy best suited to them,'' the statement said. ``The
administration would support a bill that promotes the adjustment of
work-family conflicts by providing incentives to employers to
provide leave to their employees during reasonable periods at the
birth or adoption of a child.''

<HEAD>Court Upholds Ruling Against Bendectin Damage Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury relied on scientifically invalid expert
testimony when it decided that the anti-nausea drug Bendectin
caused birth defects, an appeals court said in upholding a judge's
earlier decision.
   The decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here is the
first to validate a lower court decision setting aside a verdict in
a Bendectin case on the ground that it was not supported by valid
evidence.
   The three-judge panel said Tuesday that U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson properly ruled that the testimony of an
expert witness for the plaintiff contradicted ``nearly universal
scientific consensus.''
   In 1986, Jackson set aside the jury's award of $1.16 million to
Carita Richardson, a 10-year-old Washington girl who was born
without a right leg and with a deformed left arm and hand.
   The appellate panel concluded that the expert's opinion ``lacks
adequate basis and therefore, whether viewed alone or in
conjunction with those of other experts, did not provide the
`substantial probative evidence' that would require us to leave the
verdict as the jury rendered it.''
   The decision ``could portend a little more judicial intervention
on scientific questions,'' said Walter Olson, who heads the civil
justice reform project of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative
think tank in New York.
   In recent years, trial judges have faced a ``spiral of expert
witnesses in which each side will bring in a witness who is as
slanted toward their side as they can get away with,'' Olson said.
   ``The jury is left with the bewildering choice between experts
who appear to disagree on every possible point and make it look as
if it is in dispute in the scientific world when it's not quite as
up in the air,'' he said.
   The ruling also was hailed by Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
which made the drug for nearly 20 years.
   The decision ``further emphasizes the importance of focusing on
the scientific as well as the emotional aspect of these cases,''
said company spokesman Bill Donaldson.
   Merrell Dow contends that the drug, which was prescribed to
treat morning sickness among pregnant women, is safe. But it
stopped producing the drug in 1983 in the wake of mounting lawsuits.
   ``The circumstances of the case are tragic and Carita
Richardson's plight evokes the utmost sympathy,'' Circuit Judge
Spotswood Robinson wrote in an opinion joined by Circuit Judges
Laurence Silberman and Douglas H. Ginsburg.
   ``But in a case such as this it not only is appropriate, but
indeed imperative that the court remain vigilant to ensure that
neither emotion nor confusion has supplanted reason.''
   While ``expert witnesses are indispensable in a case such as
this,'' the court said, judges are not forced to ``accept
uncritically any sort of opinion espoused by an expert merely
because his credentials render him qualified to testify.''
   Jackson is only the second judge to set aside a jury's verdict
against the manufacturer over Bendectin. The other trial judge, in
District of Columbia Superior Court, was overruled by another
appeals court, which is considering whether to order a new trial.
   The company has won 22 verdicts from juries that found the drug
was safe. One of those verdicts was rendered in a joint trial of
1,150 claims against the drug.
   Donaldson said the company is trying to overturn four verdicts
that the drug caused birth defects. Those include a $95 million
jury award here last year that was subsequently reduced to $20
million. The jury in that case heard testimony from the same expert
who testified in the Richardson case.
   Barry Nace, the Richardson's lawyer who also won the $95 million
verdict, called Tuesday's decision a ``bad joke.''
   Nace, who vowed to appeal the ruling, said it was based on
political rather than legal reasoning.
   ``The courts have been looking for some way to get rid of these
Bendectin cases and the hundreds of children who have lawsuits they
want to file against the company,'' he said.
   Nace said the court ignored the testimony of seven other experts
who also testified that Bendectin probably caused birth defects.

   Lawrence B. ``Buck'' Curtis has drilled in the
biggest oil fields of the world, on earth and at sea, facing down
the forces of nature in hopes of pulling out a core of rock
dripping with oil.
   When that happens, he says, ``You fought the odds and you won.''
   Curtis, of Houston, has fought the odds and won in four decades
in the oil patch, creating technology that has earned him a
reputation as someone who has moved the industry to new frontiers.
   A retired vice president of the energy giant Conoco Inc., Curtis
was being inducted today into the National Academy of Engineering
for his pioneering efforts in offshore oil production and storage.
   Curtis is considered the father of tension-leg platform
technology in offshore oil and gas production that will allow
Conoco to begin unprecedented production next year in 1,760 feet of
water offshore Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The rig will be the world's deepest offshore production
platform. Unlike a conventional platform that sits on an elaborate
steel or concrete structure anchored to the seabed, the tension leg
platform is a floating structure tethered to the seabed with
tubular steel mooring lines.
   Curtis says he believes the tension leg platform technology will
allow production in even deeper waters as oilmen search for new
reserves to replace depleted supplies and attempt to ease the
nation's dependence on foreign oil.
   ``The big stuff is farther out _ it's going to be in the
frontier areas,'' he says.
   Conoco is considering the platform's use to retrieve reserves at
3,000 feet but additional technology is needed to produce oil at
depths of 7,000 feet, where Curtis believes most supplies will be
discovered.
   ``But there's nothing that says we can't do it,'' Curtis said
Tuesday. ``It's tough technology to design, but it's not any worse
than airplanes.''
   Curtis, who joined Conoco in 1949 and retired from the
Houston-based subsidiary of Du Pont Co., in January, also is
credited with installing the industry's first computer-based
oilfield automation system and with developing 500,000-barrel
undersea storage tanks for use in the waters off Dubai in the
Persian Gulf, where no deep water port was available for tankers to
retrieve the oil.
   ``Whether as a young engineer fresh out of the Colorado School
of Mines or as a tested veteran of the oil fields of the world,
Buck Curtis has consistently exhibited the drive, the creativity
and the sound judgment of a man dedicated to improving current
concepts of petroleum engineering and creating new ones,'' Charles
DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said Tuesday
at a lunch honoring Curtis' induction into engineering academy.
   ``I don't feel I was a pioneer,'' said Curtis, 64. ``I was
trying to find a solution to a problem.''
   He says such technology is in the embryonic stage, but must
overcome the concern among some environmentalists that offshore
drilling is harmful to marine life.
   ``I don't believe anything is destructed,'' he said. ``It may be
affected. I think the West Coast has a lot of potential, and Alaska
is a frontier area that may be the biggest of all.''

<HEAD>Official Says Palestinian Resuming Libya-Supported Terrorist
Effort</HEAD>

   Abu Nidal, the Palestinian terrorist who laid
low in 1987, appears to be resuming his violent campaign with
support from Libya, the top U.S. counterterrorism official said.
   L. Paul Bremer, ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, said
the apparent re-emergence of Abu Nidal is indirectly linked to the
April 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya, which the Reagan administration
accuses of sponsoring various terrorist activities.
   Bremer also said the number of terrorist incidents worldwide
appears to be headed for a record level of 1,000 this year, but the
number of Americans killed in such attacks has fallen.
   The 1986 U.S. raid on Libya and Western pressure ``has had the
effect ... in the case of Libya ... to drive the terrorism that
Libya supports into different channels, so that instead of using
diplomats and business,'' Col. Moammar Gadhafi is ``doing it more
through surrogates, like Abu Nidal and the Japanese Red Army,''
Bremer said.
   U.S. officials blame Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri Bannah,
for machine-gun attacks that killed 22 people at the Rome and
Vienna airports in December 1985.
   Abu Nidal's organization also has been blamed for attacks this
year that killed nine people on a Greek cruise ship last July and
eight in the Sudan last May. The tactics were similar to those used
in the Rome and Vienna airport attacks.
   Abu Nidal is believed to maintain a core operation of 300 people
to 400 people in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, said Bremer. And
although Syria closed Abu Nidal's offices in Damascus last year, it
still allows him to run training camps in the Bekaa Valley of
Lebanon.
   Despite the increase this year in the total number of terrorist
incidents, Bremer said counterterrorism efforts have been helped by
better international coordination.
   ``We estimate at least several hundred incidents have been
stopped by steps that we and our allies have taken over the last
three years ... maybe as many as 300 ... some major and some not,''
he said. He declined to give specifics.
   ``The bad news is that terrorism is certainly continuing.
According to the figures that we keep, ... 1987 was the worst year
in history. We had 832 recorded incidents in international
terrorism'' up from 774 in 1986, he said.
   For the first six months of 1988, ``terrorism is up
substantially over last year, perhaps by as much as a third. So it
is possible that we will end this year with as many as 1,000
incidents, maybe more, which would make 1988 the worst year,'' he
said.
   Three Americans were killed in terrorist incidents in the first
half of 1988, down from 38 in the corresponding period in 1986 and
12 in the first half of 1987, he said.
   The greatest surge in terrorist incidents stems from attacks on
Pakistani civilians by agents of the Kremlin-backed regime in
Afghanistan, Bremer said.
   About half the terrorist incidents last year took place in the
Middle East, and there has been an upsurge in attacks in Peru and
Colombia, he said.
   On another topic, Bremer said the United States has evidence
that Tehran has sponsored terrorist incidents within the past month.

   Heeding a decade of pressure from
environmentalists, farm-state senators say the time is ripe to
speed up safety reviews of pest-killing chemicals, some of which
are finding their way to American dinner tables.
   ``For the first time in many years, we are hopeful that
agreement can be reached on some simple but significant changes,''
said Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., and
four fellow senators in a letter urging support.
   The bill would accelerate to nine years safety reviews of some
600 pesticides begun a decade ago and which would not be finished
for more than 35 years at the present pace. It would send the bill
to the manufacturers rather than to the taxpayers as under the
current system.
   The aim is to ban use of the most dangerous pesticides and limit
the use of others which could pose a threat. A number of the
chemicals, which are used to combat rodents, insects and other
forms of crop blight, have been found to cause cancer and other
severe health defects in laboratory experiments.
   Indemnity payments by the government to buy up stocks of banned
pesticides would be ended for the most part. They have cost $20
million so far, and even if the bill becomes law far greater
outlays are likely before they trail off.
   The bill would reauthorize the 1947 Federal Insecticide,
Rodenticide and Fungicide Act, whose very title might seem
resistant to attempts to glamorize the issue.
   Environmentalists, however, sought to do precisely that Tuesday,
bringing in actress Meryl Streep to lobby in favor of the bill.
Arriving at the office of Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., she said
her chief concern was the safety of her children.
   ``I went to cook dinner tonight and everything I pulled out of
the refrigerator could have been harmful,'' Streep said.
   Lugar is among lawmakers pushing for approval of the
House-passed measure, but no lawmakers are claiming that the bill
is the ultimate answer to the pesticide issue launched by
naturalist Rachel Carson in her 1962 bestseller ``Silent Spring''
and a focus of the environmental movement ever since.
   Missing from the bill is any provision to get the government
moving on a cleanup of groundwater contaminated by pesticides.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is currently surveying the
extent of toxic chemical seepage into groundwater, which feeds 13
million wells nationwide and provides the basic drinking supply for
117 million Americans.
   The Capitol Hill-based U.S. Public Interest Research Group said
recently, however, an inspection of EPA records shows at least 34
different pesticides in groundwater in 34 states, based on 45,000
well samples.
   Most environmentalists are in favor of the measure but only in a
lukewarm way. Some who say they oppose the bill fear that a
bare-bones law with a three-year lifespan will put the entire issue
on ice until 1992 _ ruling out action on the groundwater issue next
year.
   ``It's like there are three seconds to go until the end of the
game and there you are on the 30-yard line,'' said compromise
advocate Maureen Hinckle, a lobbyist for the National Audubon
Society. ``You don't go for the touchdown, you kick the field
goal.''
   ``This isn't kicking the field goal,'' said Dave Baker,
political director of Friends of the Earth and a critic of the
bill. ``This is running out of the end zone and conceding the
safety ... We can't do that.''

   With barely a flush of anger, they told tales
of human waste spewing from train toilets onto railworkers and
station platforms.
   Some accused Amtrak, the national passenger rail line, of not
trying to dispose of the problem.
   ``I'm the one being squirted on. He's (Amtrak official) not
being squirted and he's got the attitude,'' George E. Jones, of
Local 24 of the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen, told a
subcommittee hearing of the House Government Operations Committee
on Tuesday.
   Jones and A. Tom Matthews, Utah state chairman of the
Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, showed the panel a
videotape of broadcast news stories illustrating the disposal
problem on the rails, the station platforms and, graphically, the
lens of the camera.
   The hearing resulted from complaints from railworkers and city
officials whose downtown train stations have been sprayed with a
mixture of human urine, feces and shredded toilet paper as the
Amtrak trains pass through or stop.
   Amtrak spokesman Tim Gillespie told the panel the company was in
line with federal regulations because it was exempted in 1976 by
Congress from an order to retrofit all passenger and freight
toilets.
   In addition, he cited a 1978 report by the department of Health,
Education and Welfare _ now the Health and Human Services
Department _ indicating that there ``have been no identifiable
disease outbreaks or illnesses which might be . . . associated with
railroad waste discharge.''
   ``In the absence of a known health risk or the potential of
disease, Amtrak questions the advisability of spending extremely
scarce capital and operating funds to alleviate what essentially
amounts to a problems of aesthetics,'' Gillespie said. The
retrofitting would cost the company at least $34 million, he said.
   ``That is perhaps the most arrogant statement I have seen in a
very long time,'' snapped Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman
of the subcommittee on government activities and transportation.
``It would seem to me that Amtrak would have some kind of concern
for the well-being of people who work on its tracks.''
   Ken Alkema, Utah's director of environmental health, told the
hearing that a 1970 document from the National Communicable Disease
Center indicated that ``we are in essential agreement that a
potential health hazard exists whenever human excreta are disposed
above ground.''
   Alkema said efforts to recruit the Food and Drug Administration
for assistance failed when the FDA said it had ``no enforcement
authority over Amtrak.'' He urged Congress to enact appropriate
legislation.
   Jones, the railway signalman, told of a Aug. 17 incident near
Helper, Utah in which a train that had stopped to transfer a sick
passenger to a local ambulance illegally discharged at least four
waste tanks in front of passengers, police and ambulance workers.
   ``You should have seen those medical people having to walk
through that sewage to put the passenger in the ambulance,'' Jones
said.
   Gillespie said Amtrak had no knowledge of the discharge.

<HEAD>Watchdog Agency Raises Doubt About Converting Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Accounting Office says converting
a partially completed commercial nuclear reactor to a weapons
production reactor may raise policy questions over separation of
civilian and military nuclear facilities.
   However, a GAO report to Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said there
were ``no major safety, technical or other barriers'' which would
preclude the Washington state reactor from being considered as an
option for the next new defense materials production reactor.
   The plant, 63 percent complete and owned by the Washington
Public Power Supply System, is situated on the Department of
Energy's Hanford Reservation near Richland, Wash.
   In August, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington recommended
construction of two new weapons production reactors _ a heavy water
reactor at DOE's Savannah River Plant in South Carolina and a
high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor at Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory in Idaho.
   Also, Herrington said research and development should continue
on the possibility of converting the commercial light water reactor
at Hanford, known as Washington Nuclear Plant No. 1 or WNP-1.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said in a report
dated Sept. 21 that ``while DOE's condemnation and completion of a
partially completed commercial power plant as a defense production
plant do not violate the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty or existing
law, it may raise policy questions.''
   ``For example, such action may be criticized on the basis that
it breaks away from the traditional separation between peaceful use
of atomic energy and military use,'' it said.
   Although DOE has statutory authority to condemn the WNP-1 plant,
the GAO said, the plant's cost through condemnation is not known.
``The cost could range from $30 million (salvage value) to $2.1
billion (total of the outstanding bonds).''
   A DOE subcontractor has estimated that in addition to the cost
of acquiring the plant, the cost of completing WNP-1 for production
of tritium _ a hydrogen isotope used in nuclear weapons _ is $2.6
billion.
   In addition to the policy questions, the GAO pointed to other
issues including:
   _ Possible need to modify WNP-1's decay heat removal system,
used to remove heat from the core once the reactor is shut down,
and the station's blackout prevention system, to provide auxiliary
power in case regular sources of electric power are unavailable.
   _ Preventing ``recriticality,'' a fuel meltdown condition that
``can result in an extremely severe accident.'' The GAO said this
risk has been precluded by using 10 percent enriched uranium fuel,
rather than the 20 percent enriched fuel initially planned.
   _ Technical issues dealing with the design and manufacture of
tritium ``target pins'' used within the reactor, as well as with
the reactor's capability of meeting tritium production goals.

   The Air Force is trying to decide whether to
approve a contractor's $520 million offer to improve the B-1 bomber
or whether to try another solution to the troubled plane's
electronic problems.
   ``We just got the (Eaton Corp.) proposal in the last month.
We're looking at it and we're looking at other alternatives,'' said
Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael D. Hall.
   ``We're going to put together a plan by the end of the year, but
at this point, we're not sure which option we will pick,'' Hall
said Tuesday.
   Hall commented shortly after Charles Barron, a representative of
Eaton, said it would cost $520 million for Eaton to improve the
electronic defensive systems aboard the 100 B-1s purchased by the
Air Force.
   That $520 million would be atop the $3.5 billion Eaton contract
already spent by the Air Force for the sophisticated computer
systems which form the brains of the swing-wing plane's defenses.
   The comments were made at a Boston University seminar on the
B-1, which has been the subject of criticism ever since it was
resurrected by President Reagan seven years ago.
   President Carter terminated the plane 11 years ago, but Reagan
reversed that decision, saying the B-1 was needed as a replacement
for the aging B-52s that are the heart of the U.S. nuclear bomber
force. Reagan also decided at the same time to go ahead with the
radar-evading ``stealth'' bomber, which is known as the B-2.
   In 1981, Reagan promised Congress that the 100 B-1s could be
purchased for $20.5 billion, a figure that has grown to $28 billion
through inflation.
   All 100 of the planes, model B-1Bs, have been delivered to the
Air Force, but the service has discovered that their electronic
``counter-measures'' systems need to be improved or the planes
won't make it through Soviet defenses and return should they be
used during a nuclear war.
   The costs to improve the B-1 would be in addition to the $28
billion already spent on the planes and some critics, such as Rep.
Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
have suggested that Congress should decide whether to go ahead with
the improvements or spend the money for other weapons.
   Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, told the seminar, ``the problems with the B-1B are real
and have to be fixed.''
   McCurdy said Aspin's suggestion about halting improvements
wasn't likely to be fulfilled.
   ``No, we're not going to park it,'' he said. ``That's not a
realistic suggestion at this point, since we've already bought and
paid for the plane.''
   ``But we do have to make some decisions about what to do,''
McCurdy said. ``The Eaton proposal is very interesting. I'd not
heard that $520 million figure before.''
   Barron said the Eaton proposal would correct flaws identified by
the Air Force. ``There's no fatal flaw in the B-1B,'' he said.
   Pentagon officials again defended the plane Tuesday, as they
have in the past.
   Dan Howard, chief Pentagon spokesman, said, ``It's the best
manned bomber in the world. It's light years ahead of any other
bomber.''
   Brig. Gen. Robert E. Dempsey of the Strategic Air Command, said,
``Can it do the mission? I would say absolutely so,'' although he
added, ``range would be a consideration.''

   Richard F. Grein, bishop of Kansas since 1981,
was elected coadjutor bishop of the Episcopal Church's New York
diocese on Tuesday, and will automatically succeed Bishop Paul
Moore Jr. upon Moore's retirement.
   The election of Grein, who will serve under Moore, required a
majority of the delegates in the diocesan convention's two
``houses,'' one composed of clergy, one of laity.
   He was selected on the 10th ballot around midnight, said Paul
Gorman, spokesman for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in
Manhattan.
   More than 900 convention delegates and alternates gathered for
the election on the grounds of the cathedral. They were offered
five nominees by a committee that made a national search for
Moore's successor.
   One was the 55-year-old Grein, who was the only candidate
heading a diocese.He is a native of Bemidji, Minn.
   ``There is no school for bishops. Only by doing it could I learn
how,'' he said prior to the election. He was not present when the
vote occurred.
   A leading candidate, Suffragan Bishop Walter D. Dennis Jr., 56,
collapsed early in the balloting and his name was withdrawn from
consideration.
   Dennis, a Moore assistant elected in 1979, was taken by
ambulance to the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center after he had
a seizure and fell in the cathedral's Synod House.
   Hospital spokeswoman Cathy Rohan said Dennis was in stable
condition.
   Dennis was the only black candidate for coadjutor bishop.
   The other nominees included:
   _The Rev. C. Hugh Hildesley, 47, rector of the Church of
Heavenly Rest in Manhattan. He left Sotheby's auction house, where
he was senior vice president, to become a priest.
   _The Rev. Thomas F. Pike, 50, rector of Calvary-St. George's
Church in Manhattan since 1975.
   _The Rev. George F. Regas, 57, rector of All Saints Church in
Pasadena, Calif., since 1967. He helped develop one of the church's
largest U.S. congregations, with more than 3,000 members.
   Moore, 68, has indicated he will retire before the mandatory age
of 72. Installed as bishop in 1970, he went on to become one of the
nation's most prominent liberal clergymen. He also decided to
resume construction of St. John the Divine, which is designed to be
the world's largest Gothic cathedral.
   The New York diocese covers Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten
Island and several suburban counties, and includes more than 64,000
Episcopalians. It is the eighth largest Episcopal diocese in the
United States.

<HEAD>Science Group Endorses Use Of Animals In Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of animals in research is appropriate,
despite the pain suffered by the animals involved, the National
Academy of Sciences has concluded.
   ``Research with animals has saved human lives, lessened human
suffering and advanced scientific understanding,'' the academy said
in a report Tuesday from its research arm, the National Research
Council.
   The report was written as a response to the animal rights
movement. It noted that the animals used in research often die, and
recommended more frequent use of animals abandoned in pounds and
shelters.
   ``This document says that in the best judgment of people with
diverse opinions, it is appropriate to use animals in research for
human welfare,'' said Dr. Dominick P. Pirpira, one member of the
committee that wrote the report. ``It is the job of humans to care
for each other.''
   Another panel member, Christine Stevens, president of the Animal
Welfare Institute, refused to sign the report. She said it
underestimated the amount of animal abuse in laboratories
nationwide.
   The report is ``scientifically flawed, factually inaccurate,
morally unenlightened, defensive and a disservice to animals and
people'' said People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. PETA
also charged the report was tainted because it was paid for by the
National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies that use
animals in research.
   About 20 million animals, mostly rats and mice, are used by U.S.
researchers yearly, and fewer than 200,000 of the more than 10
million unwanted animals killed in pounds or shelter in the United
States annually are released to researchers.

   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan, a longtime
gun control advocate now being tried on weapons charges, says he
thought the pistol he used to shoot a backyard intruder was exempt
from local registration laws.
   Closing arguments were set to begin today in Rowan's trial on
charges of using an unregistered handgun in the June 14 shooting of
a teen-ager who had taken an uninvited dip in the columnist's
backyard swimming pool.
   If convicted of the misdemeanor charges, the 63-year-old Rowan
could face up to two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Arthur L. Burnett said
Tuesday that jury deliberations would begin immediately after
prosecutors and defense lawyers finished summarizing their cases.
   Rowan told the jury on Tuesday that in 1982 his son, then an FBI
agent, left the .22-caliber pistol in his father's bedroom after
the columnist received death threats from persons purporting to be
members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   ``I was getting a lot of threats after Vernon Jordan (former
head of the National Urban League) was shot. They said, `You're
next, nigger,''' Rowan testified.
   Rowan said his son was told by District police officials that he
had a ``blanket exemption'' from the city's tough handgun
registration laws because he was a federal agent.
   He said police also told his son there would be ``no problem''
if Rowan Sr. handled the weapon.
   Earlier, Rowan's son, Carl Jr., testified that twice in 1982 and
once when he was preparing to leave the FBI in 1983 he was told by
police that he did not have to register weapons he had purchased
for personal use.
   After telling police that other members of his family might
handle the weapon, ``they told me that as long as it was where it
lawfully should be, if others have access to it, it isn't a
problem,'' Rowan Jr. testified.
   Rowan's attorneys have maintained that the columnist and his son
were given inaccurate advice by members of the police department's
gun control unit about the city's gun registration policy, which
stipulates that a weapon can be used only by its registered owner.
   Police Inspector James R. Lee, introduced by Rowan's attorney as
an expert witness on gun registration matters, said Tuesday that
while Rowan broke the law by using the unregistered weapon, he
should not have been prosecuted because he thought he was acting in
self-defense.
   Detective Charles J. Jones, who arrived at Rowan's house
immediately after the June 14 shooting, told the court that a
sliding glass door at the rear of the house showed signs that
someone had tried to force it open.
   However, Jones could not say when the door was damaged.
   Rowan has said he shot Benjamin Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md.,
because he was afraid Smith was trying to enter his house. Smith,
who was shot in the wrist, has said he was trying to leave the
property when Rowan shot him.
   Jones testified that evidence indicated that the shooting had
taken place at close range, near the door.

<HEAD>Met Opera Performs First `Giulio Cesare'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the second night of its season, the
Metropolitan Opera presented a series of firsts.
   Handel's 1724 ``Giulio Cesare,'' set in Egypt in 48 B.C., was
sung at the Met for the first time.
   Trevor Pinnock, a British early music specialist who'd never
conducted an opera before, conducted.
   The Met never before had a countertenor (male alto) on its
stage. In ``Giulio Cesare'' it had two.
   Kathleen Battle was the vocal star of Tuesday evening, singing
Cleopatra. Her voice is delicate but so focused that it never
sounds weak. Sound comes from her like a golden thread. The
coloratura passages aren't especially glittering from Miss Battle
because all her singing is sweetly spun gold.
   The musical style, vocal and orchestral, was exemplary. The
orchestra, of only 30 pieces, did not consist of original
instruments, which often are out of tune. Handel's music has
serenity, as beautiful melodies are stated, repeated and
embellished without haste. Pinnock managed to conduct so that often
there also was urgency and excitement.
   Tatiana Troyanos sang Julius Caesar. She began with much florid
singing, making a strenuous effort to get it right, which she did,
but sounding as though she had about half a voice. In the last
act's florid singing, her voice was much fuller, and rich, though
effort could still be heard. Her Julius Caesar didn't step forward
as an opera's title character should.
   Jeffrey Gall, a native of Cleveland, made his Met debut as
Ptolemy, Cleopatra's brother, a countertenor role. His voice is
interesting and not unpleasant, though it doesn't sound entirely
human. It sounds like a cross between a female mezzo-soprano and
words coming through a hollow reed.
   The other countertenor, whose role as Cleopatra's confidant is
smaller, is Derek Lee Ragin, who was born in West Point, N.Y., and
grew up in Newark. His voice sounds warmer and more a cross between
a mezzo and a tenor's falsetto.
   Sarah Walker as the wife of Pompey and Martine Dupuy as their
son were exceptionally effective in large parts. Bass Julien
Robbins also was admirable as commander in chief of Ptolemy's army,
one of the opera's few low voices.
   The production was created by the English National Opera in 1979
and has been performed at the San Francisco Opera and in Geneva,
Switzerland. The women's costumes are lavish and don't attempt to
look Egyptian. Gowns are basically Elizabethan, with bustles and
ruff collars.
   The concept of the stage sets was pleasing. Each scene had a few
pillars or monuments or thrones. Before scenes ended, singers would
step forward and a screen would drop behind them so the stage could
be changed for the next scene. It was orderly without being
symmetrical.
   John Copley, in charge of production, John Pascoe, sets, and
Michael Stennett, costumes, were making Met debuts.
   This opera is remembered here for the New York City Opera
production which transposed the title role so that bass-baritone
Norman Treigle could sing it. And it made the Cleopatra, Beverly
Sills, a star.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
says the Soviet Union has suspended the withdrawal of its troops
from Afghanistan because of persistent violations of a
U.N.-negotiated agreement.
   Also Tuesday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the United
States and Pakistan to ``come to their senses'' and stop arming the
guerrillas fighting the communist Afghan government.
   In remarks reported by the official Tass news agency, Gorbachev
said Pakistan was trying to install leaders in neighboring
Afghanistan to its own liking despite the wishes of the Afghan
people.
   At the United Nations, Shevardnadze said the Soviets have not
yet begun the second stage of their withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Half a Soviet force of more than 100,000 troops had pulled out by
Aug. 15.
   ``Let's wait and see,'' he told reporters. ``It is necessary to
stop the violations that take place. It is the most important
thing.''
   In a speech to the General Assembly earlier, he asked the five
members of the U.N. Security Council to discuss violations of the
withdrawal agreement with Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   ``As soon as Soviet troops began to withdraw, a non-stop
production line of violations was set in motion,'' said
Shevardnadze.
   He did not name Pakistan, but the Soviet Union has filed
numerous complaints with the United Nations complaining that
Pakistan is allowing U.S.-backed guerrillas to launch raids into
Afghanistan from bases in Pakistan.
   ``This cannot be allowed to happen,'' he said. ``We're not
complaining to anyone. We have the means to make things fall into
place. But we are responsible to the United Nations and therefore
are appealing to it.''
   The U.N.-brokered withdrawal accords, signed in Geneva on April
14 by Pakistan and Afghanistan with the United States and Soviet
Union as guarantors, called for the Soviets complete its pullout by
Feb. 15, 1989.
   The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979 after an
invitation from a Moscow-backed communist government in Kabul.
   Pakistan has been a major backer of about 200,000
anti-government guerrillas, who have used it as a base of
operations. The United States and China have also lent support to
the rebels.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in New York that
the Security Council _ whose five permanent members are the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain, China and France _ would meet
Friday and could discuss violations of the withdrawal accords.
   But he said the United States does not recognize the Afghan
government and would not invite it to join the meeting.
   He said the Afghan government should stop violating Pakistan's
air space with war plane overflights and air raids on guerrilla
camps.
   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan said that since
April 14, Afghanistan has violated the accords with air raids and
terrorism.
   He told the General Assembly Tuesday that the Afghan air force
has launched 387 air and ground violations of Pakistani territory,
causing 40 deaths and injuring 114 people.
   He also accused Afghanistan of sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan,
saying Afghan agents mounted 259 attacks in 1987, killing 264
people and wounding 1,069. Since the Afghan accords, there have
almost 70 more terrorist attacks, killing 74 people and injuring
55, he said.

   Hugh Harris, one of the old hands
around the Kennedy Space Center, was asked to resolve a problem by
a novice reporter treading the space beat for the Discovery launch.
   ``We'll work it in real time,'' Harris said. The reporter looked
puzzled. Heck, in the old days everyone would have known he meant
``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.''
   It's all so different now.
   The veteran space reporters, the ones who covered the Vanguard
missions in the early days and grew old writing about the Mercury,
Gemini, Apollo and Skylab flights, came back at the start of the
shuttle program in 1981 for this new era of ships launched like
rockets, orbiting like satellites, and returning like airplanes.
   But public interest faded, shuttle launches stopped being a big
deal, and when Challenger blew up on that freezing day in 1986, the
journalists at the launch site could be counted in the hundreds.
Television networks had long stopped watching.
   This is 1988 and the space program has taken its lumps, the
Russians got ahead, and things are pulsing again. There is a
shuttle on the pad, the hotels are full, and the excitement has
returned to the Cape.
   It's a different kind of excitement. More subdued, a little
apprehensive. The memory of that awful fireball in the sky is still
too fresh, and nobody thinks of space flight any more as routine.
   There's a new crowd here, some people who weren't even born when
Alan Shepard took his little hop down the Atlantic and who wouldn't
know an EVA from MTV, for gosh sakes.
   There are people in Cocoa Beach now who couldn't name the Seven
Original Astronauts if their lives depended on it, who don't
remember when the Starlight Motel was a hangout for ``America's
Heroes _ Our Astronauts.''
   These are folks who think of Sesame Street when you talk about
``The Bird'' and who ask such questions as ``Why is the fuel tank
pointed on top?'' (Answer: For the same reason that automobiles are
not shaped like cubes.)
   ``More than half to two-thirds of the people never have been
here, they don't know what they're hearing or where to go,''
Harris, who has been running the NASA newsroom it seems, forever,
said of the new crop of reporters who got the space assignment for
this one.
   You can spot them easily, grabbing every piece of paper put out
on the newsroom counter by a beefed up corps of NASA spokesmen and
women. And don't think the space agency, which has taken a
battering since Challenger, isn't taking advantage of this
opportunity to shine.
   It's spruced up its auditorium to get rid of the tacky
backgrounds that used to be the hallmark of news conferences; it's
got TV lights, and a fancy modernistic logo and representatives who
will do standups and speak for the agency whenever they are asked.
And canny old NASA is sneaking in briefings about every program on
its drawing boards, and even bringing in experts who don't speak in
acronyms.
   Ask any of the old-timers, who reminisce about the Apollo 12
launch struck by lightning in the rain, what is different and
they'll say the people.
   The look and the feel of the place is different, less
adventurous somehow.
   Sure, there are a few signs in the towns around: ``Go
Discovery,'' ``Good Luck, Discovery Crew.'' And, yes, the Chamber
of Commerce has somehow made green ribbons the symbol of upward and
onward.
   But none of the fever of the 1960s when two Gemini spaceships
were going to rendezvous for the first time, and when Apollo 8 flew
to the moon, circled it on Christmas, and came home again, or even
in 1981 when John Young and Bob Crippen took the shuttle Columbia
up for the first time.
   This crowd takes it more for granted now, and that probably
accounted for the surprise when Challenger blew up. Spaceflight
never was safe and nobody who'd been around it ever thought it was.
   Since Challenger, the shuttle has been surrounded by so many
protections it will be a wonder that it gets launched at all.
   ``We went from guidelines to rules,'' said Anne McCauley,
speaking for the Air Force, which presides over weather and range
safety for the shuttle. And senior Master Sgt. Mike Beeman said,
``A jet aircraft can take off in any kind of weather, but when you
launch the shuttle...'' His voice trailed off as he held up a thick
packet of rules.
   They're all more serious about this thing. Traditionally,
industry representatives have provided coffee and doughnuts in
their own press center and they've given away all manner of
trinkets from sun visors, to rain jackets, to little shuttle decals
to put on briefcases.
   That's all gone. All they hand out now is information.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Thatcher Sees Benefits For West From Gorbachev's
Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says it
will be ``in the Western interest'' for Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
succeed in his efforts to reshape the Soviet Union.
   In an interview published today in The New York Times, Mrs.
Thatcher was asked what particularly appeals to her about
Gorbachev's policies. She said it's ``the idea that enlarging the
liberty and responsibility will give you greater economic
prosperity.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, interviewed in London on Tuesday, said when she
visited the Soviet Union last year she wondered whether it would be
``in the Western interest'' for Gorbachev to succeed. She has
decided it would be, Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Concerning those efforts, the prime minister said: ``It's a
great, massive turnaround, where you have in fact been saying to
people for 70 years, you don't do anything unless you've got
permission, to turn round and say, well now, look you've got to do
quite a lot on your own initiative.''
   Mrs. Thatcher also said Britain will support the changes in the
Soviet Union ``in every way we can without interfering.'' She cited
an increase in East-West contacts and in joint ventures between
Soviet state enterprises and British companies.
   But she also said this uncertain period of change in the Eastern
bloc ``requires total Western unity and preparedness.''
   She said Britain will insist that the NATO alliance modernize
conventional and nuclear weapons in Western Europe.
   On another subject, the prime minister said she didn't watch the
debate between presidential candidates George Bush and Michael
Dukakis.
   ``I'm not going to get involved in your election problems for
very obvious reasons,'' she said.

   Much of Love Canal has been declared
safe for resettlement, and Nunzio LoVerdi, who spent years trying
to stay in the neighborhood that became synonymous with chemical
contamination, vowed to be the first back.
   ``Your home is your home no matter what happens to it,'' LoVerdi
said Tuesday. ``I'm going back.''
   State health officials announced Tuesday that hundreds of former
Love Canal residents may return to the homes they left after the
neighborhood was declared a disaster by President Jimmy Carter 10
years ago. Up to 80 other families were hoping the study would
confirm their decision to stay in their homes near the former
chemical dump site.
   The state health commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, said that as a
result of state and federal cleanup efforts, most areas of Love
Canal contain no more chemicals than other neighborhoods in this
industrial city.
   Axelrod met with about 200 former residents Tuesday night to
announce his findings. Axelrod said, however, that some blocks
remain unsafe, affecting about 10 families.
   The long-anticipated finding was hailed by former residents who
feared that their neighborhood would be left boarded up and mostly
abandoned as a symbol of environmental disaster.
   ``We didn't want to be a symbol of anything. We just wanted our
lifestyle back,'' said LoVerdi, a retired laborer who led a group
of renters fighting city and state plans to tear down the Lasalle
Housing Project and other homes in the area.
   LoVerdi was among the renters evicted this spring from the
project, where state officials never found contamination. It is
scheduled to be torn down because it would cost too much to
renovate.
   Niagara Falls Mayor Michael O'Laughlin said Axelrod's decision
will be good for the city of 71,000, which borders Canada and the
famous falls.
   ``It won't mean a landslide of people moving back,'' O'Laughlin
said. ``But it will mean the city will begin to put the nightmare
behind it.''
   Phyllis Festor, president of the Niagara Falls Board of
Realtors, said the city is having a real estate boom, and that
housing prices have increased in the Love Canal area during the
last three years.
   ``The decision was so long in coming that, for most people, it
doesn't matter anymore,'' she said.
   Former resident Lois Gibbs, who now heads a Washington-based
environmental group, said that despite resettlement, Love Canal
would always remain a ``monument to disaster.''
   Ms. Gibbs pointed out that while most of the residential areas
may be free of chemicals, that only meant the chemical threat had
been contained, not removed.
   Ms. Gibbs said the state would have serious liability problems
if new contamination were discovered in resettled areas.
   Love Canal, an abandoned waterway, was used by the Hooker
Chemical Co. to dispose of thousands of pounds of chemical wastes
in the 1940s. The company made herbicides and pesticides.
   In the 1950s, the canal and its contents were filled in and
homes and an elementary school were built on top. It wasn't until
the early 1970s that residents began to notice foul smells in their
basements and oily puddles in their yards.
   They also began to notice higher-than-usual incidences of
miscarriages, birth defects, cancer, leukemia, neurological
disorders, allergies, epilepsy and suicide.
   There were near riots at town meetings in the late 1970s when
the dangers from the chemicals were revealed to residents.
Eventually, 728 homes in a 50-block area were evacuated. The
elementary school and 228 houses were demolished.
   The state and federal governments filed multimillion-dollar
lawsuits against Hooker's parent company, Occidental Petroleum
Corp. Much of that litigation is pending.
   The dump site has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and
plastic liners to prevent the chemicals from leaking into the air
or ground water. Corroding drums of dioxins and other chemicals
have been separated and complex runoff and monitoring systems built.
   As part of the state ruling, a committee of local officials will
create a plan to resettle the neighborhood and assist homeowners in
renovation.

<HEAD>New Government Board To Police Film Colorization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed legislation that
sets up a government board to police the practice of film
colorization.
   The National Film Preservation Board and its $100,000 budget was
included in the $10.5 billion appropriation for the Interior
Department and related agencies Reagan signed on Tuesday.
   The board is to establish a national film register labeling
movies according to their cultural, historical and aesthetic
interest and then report on alterations, such as colorization, that
are made in a registered film.
   If the Patent and Copyright Office found a copyright
infringement, it would be required to apply to the appropriate U.S.
attorney's office for a temporary restraining order and make
recommendations for civil proceedings.

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Has Trouble Managing Huge Inventory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has more than doubled its
collection of spare parts and other materials under President
Reagan's military buildup, leaving the Defense Department unable to
properly manage the stockpile, a congressional report concludes.
   ``The enormous, unprecedented, and unsustainable growth in the
Pentagon's secondary inventory has simply overwhelmed the
Pentagon's depots, warehouses, and accounting and control
systems,'' the study issued Tuesday by the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee said.
   The study of so-called ``secondary items'' _ such things as
spares, repair parts, supplies, food and clothing _ has grown from
$43 billion in value in 1980 to $94 billion.
   The report, the latest study by the Democratic-controlled panel
on defense inventories, said the Pentagon is still doing a poor job
of managing the stockpile despite reforms.
   Concluding that management of the materials ``has not kept pace
with the Pentagon's ability to spend money on new goods,'' the
report said the Defense Department should reduce the growing volume
of items it has in its inventory.

   The Teamsters Union must wait until Monday to
mail out ratification ballots on a newly renegotiated three-year
contract covering some 20,000 drivers of auto transport trucks.
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth issued a temporary

ballots for five days. Dissident Teamsters complained that a
``quickie'' vote would preclude them from raising a campaign to
defeat the accord.
   The Teamsters had planned to mail out the ballots today on a new
tentative contract reached with some 30 auto transport companies
late last week.
   An earlier tentative accord reached in July was rejected by 72
percent of the covered members in the union, prompting a reopening
of negotiations that resulted in last week's agreement.

<TEXT>
   The bulky orange pressure suits are
far less comfortable than the coveralls shuttle crews once wore _
and they take forever to put on. But they could be lifesavers for
Discovery's astronauts.
   The 75-pound suits, never before worn into space, are to be worn
only during takeoff and landing and come packed with parachutes,
lifeboats and radios. They are part of a new escape system,
including a telescoping pole and an escape hatch, that was devised
in the aftermath of Challenger, although it would not have helped
in the disaster that killed seven astronauts.
   ``It's not a very comfortable thing to walk around in, but it's
got a lot of capabilities,'' said Roly Rice, project engineer for
the escape system at NASA's Johnson Space Center.
   It's so uncomfortable, in fact, that NASA has cut the ``launch
window'' _ the span in which liftoff could occur _ from three to 2{
hours to reduce the time the five crew members must spend on their
backs inside the orbiter while dressed in the garments.
   The astronauts also will have to wake up about 30 minutes
earlier than previously on launch day because it takes extra time
to put the suits on.
   During the first four shuttle flights, astronauts wore
less-sophisticated pressure suits that were to be used in
combination with ejection seats in case of a launch emergency. But
after the shuttle was deemed ``operational,'' the seats were
removed and the suits replaced with simple coveralls.
   The Rogers Commission, which investigated the 1986 Challenger
explosion, urged the space agency to return to some type of escape
system. NASA, after considering several possibilities, picked the
escape hatch and pole.
   The most likely use for the escape system would be if the main
engines failed during launch and prevented the shuttle from
reaching orbit. If the crew were unable to return to the Kennedy
Space Center runway or make an emergency landing overseas, it would
until now have been faced with ditching the shuttle in the ocean _
a prospect NASA officials consider unsurvivable.
   The new system provides another option, letting the astronauts
bail out before the shuttle hits the ocean.
   In such a scenario, commander Richard H. Hauck would ditch the
external fuel tank and try to steer into a controlled, gliding and
subsonic flight.
   At 30,000 feet, astronaut George Nelson would blow an explosive
hatch that would deploy the new curved telescoping pole. The cabin
would have been vented at 40,000 feet so the pressure inside would
be equal to the outside to avoid an explosive decompression when
the hatch is blown.
   The pole would jut out from the side of the orbiter and each
astronaut would attach a ring to it and bail out, beginning at
about 25,000 feet.
   ``They basically just dive out head first down the pole,'' Rice
said.
   He said the crew should be able to bail out in about two minutes.
   Parachutes attached to their suits would be triggered
automatically, although they could also be opened manually. The
suits have water wings and a lifeboat stored in the prachute pack
would open before the astronaut lands in the ocean.
   Each suit includes a radio, a flare kit and motion sickness
pills, Rice said.
   ``They'll (the astronauts) be about a mile apart each in the
ocean depending on when they exit the shuttle,'' Rice said.
   To help in case the astronauts do have to leap into the
Atlantic, 18 Air Force parachute rescuers were dispatched last week
from Florida to Gambia and Morocco on Africa's northwest coast.
   ``We'll be there to catch them if they fall,'' said Tech. Sgt.
John Smith before leaving for Benguerir, Morocco, where he heads
the group of jumpers deployed there.
   Each of the two nine-member jumper groups is assigned to a C-130
Hercules cargo plane that would home in on signals from emergency
transmitters the astronauts carry with them, explained the
squadron's commander, Col. Edward Behling.
   The jumpers, along motorized rubber boats and medical supplies,
would parachute from 3,000 feet into the water near where the
astronauts were located. They would pick up the astronauts and wait
until they could be rescued by a ship or helicopter.
   NASA officials first wanted the suits to be blue, but decided to
make them orange after realizing they would be more visible in the
ocean.
   The escape system could be used on liftoff only after the solid
rocket boosters finish firing and peel off from the orbiter two
minutes into flight. The Challenger explosion occurred 73 seconds
after takeoff, when the device would have been no help.
   The system also could be used on landing, if the astronauts find
they are coming down short of the runway at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., and need to bail out.

<HEAD>Heavy Metal Adds Heavy Cost To VP Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor's office has added $200,000 to the
city's potential tab for hosting the Oct. 5 vice presidential
debate, bringing the estimated cost to $900,000.
   The cost includes about $43,000 the city will pay to buy out a
heavy metal rock concert by the ``Scorpions'' that had been
scheduled for the City Auditorium, mayoral aide Kevin Collison said
Tuesday.
   The cost of staging the debate between Sens. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, and Dan Quayle, R-Ind., increased largely because the city
was forced to switch the debate site from the Orpheum Theater to
the City Auditorium, Collison said.
   The auditorium was the second choice of city officials who said
they could not afford the $200,000 needed to buy out three shows of
the musical ``Cats'' that were scheduled over two days at the
Orpheum.
   Collison said other costs _ including new chairs and a new
lighting system _ have driven the price tag for the auditorium
higher than had been forecast.

   The Soviet Union says it will turn a
controversial radar complex into an international space research
center and has asked the United States to follow suit with radar
sites in Britain and Greenland.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze made the offer
during a speech at the 43rd General Assembly on Tuesday.
   Shevardnadze said the disputed radar complex in Siberia near the
city of Krasnoyarsk could be used by a world space organization.
The United States has said it will not sign a treaty to cut
superpower nuclear arsenals unless Moscow agrees to dismantle the
radar, which is not yet completed.
   U.S. officials say the radar violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty because it is not on the outskirts of the Soviet
Union facing outward, as the treaty requires.
   Earlier this month, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev made a
proposal similar to that of Shevardnadze. He also suggested the
United States take ``appropriate action'' concerning its disputed
phased-array radars in Greenland and Britain, which the Soviets say
violate the ABM Treaty.
   ``By doing that we would not only lay the material groundwork
for international cooperation in space but would also strengthen
the ABM Treaty regime,'' Shevardnadze said Tuesday. His statement
appeared to be the most specific Soviet proposal yet concerning the
disputed radars.
   The speech came a day after Reagan delivered his seventh and
final address to the 159-member world body.
   The Soviet minister shared Reagan's view of the benefits of
improved Soviet-U.S. cooperation and supported the President's call
for an international conference to strenghten the global ban on
chemical weapons.
   But he criticized Reagan _ not by name _ for lecturing the world
body on the supposed superiority of U.S. democracy and respect for
human rights.
   ``Why can the great American people have their own great dream,
and why should the Cuban or the Nicaraguan, the Angolan or the
Vietnamese people be deprived of the right to have their own
ideals?'' he asked.

   A new disposable diaper is designed to keep
babies dry without chemicals and plastics that take centuries to
disintegrate in landfills.
   The biodegradable diaper, introduced at a news conference
Tuesday along with 2-year-old twin models Buck and Elizabeth, is
made of a newly developed plastic.
   The material contains a starch-free additive that allows the
material ``to be attacked by insects, bacteria and enzymes in a
landfill environment,'' said Suzanne Shelton-Foley, marketing vice
president of Rocky Mountain Medical Corp., a small, publicly owned
Greenwood, Colo.-based company that has been selling a
chemical-free diaper for about a year.
   The new diaper, called the Chemical-Free TenderCare
Biodegradable, takes about two years to biodegrade, compared with
an estimated 200 to 400 years for the typical disposable diaper,
she said.
   The company that developed the plastic, which Ms. Shelton-Foley
declined to identify, plans to use it in other disposable consumer
products, such as garbage bags, she said.
   Like Rocky Mountain's Chemical-Free TenderCare diaper, the new
product does not contain chemical polymer salts used by other
manufacturers in disposable diapers to absorb wetness.
   Such chemicals can cause eye and respiratory irritation when
inhaled, Ms. Shelton-Foley said, though she acknowledged that Rocky
Mountain's diapers are not as absorbent as those containing such
chemicals.
   Dr. Richard Rosenbaum, a former pediatrician, founder and
chairman of Rocky Mountain, said many parents are concerned about
using diapers that contain chemicals, although he did not know of
any evidence that they caused health problems.
   Dr. Sidney Hurwitz, a Yale University pediatrician and chairman
of the American Academy of Pediatrics' dermatology section, said in
a telephone interview that chemical-containing diapers pose no
health threat to babies.
   Although he said he was not familiar with the new product, ``the
idea is great,'' provided it's safe. ``I think everybody is
interested in things that are biodegradable.''
   Ms. Shelton-Foley said tests on babies have shown the product is
safe.
   A Canadian company has made biodegradable diapers, but Rocky
Mountain's product is the world's only chemical-free, 99.4 percent
biodegradable diaper, she said.
   Rocky Mountain has hired a diaper-maker to manufacture the
product, which should be available to consumers by mail or through
catalogs in December, she said.
   Like the company's chemical-free diaper, the product will cost
$59 for a box of 294 newborn-size diapers _ about 35 percent higher
than others on the market. Ms. Shelton-Foley said the higher price
is due to costs associated with mailing and manufacturing.
   Rosenbaum said he believes parents will be willing to pay more
for the product.
   ``Parents want to know that Mother Nature can degrade the
diapers after they are deposited in the county landfill, and they
don't want chemicals added to their infants' diapers,'' he said.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After watching crops shrivel in the
summer and harvests shrink in the fall, farmers have another
drought worry before next spring's planting: erosion.
   ``Each little raindrop is like a little bomb,'' said James
Pingry, a U.S. Soil Conservation Service agronomist.
   ``Anywhere there's been drought the risk of erosion is
greater,'' said Scott Argabright, an agronomist at the Soil
Conservation Service's Midwest National Technological Center in
Lincoln, Neb.
   In Iowa, conservationists said Tuesday the record pace of corn
and soybean harvests by farmers trying to prevent further crop
damage will only accelerate fall plowing and other fieldwork to
prepare for next spring.
   Stripping away the residue of the last crop and turning the dirt
over always has the risk that wind and water erosion will carry off
exposed topsoil.
   ``But this year's drought left the soil drier than usual. That
means if the land is plowed it will be especially vulnerable to
wind erosion,'' Jim Ayen, state resource conservationist for the
Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
said in an advisory urging farmers not to plow this fall.
   ``There's a definite correlation between plowing or tilling in
the fall and moisture loss,'' said James Gulliford, director of the
Iowa Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Division. ``The
best way to conserve that moisture is not to till.''
   In addition to unusually dry conditions, drought damage to crops
reduced the residue in the soil after the harvest, cutting the
natural protection available to soil left unplowed, Argabright said.
   Dry soil also is vulnerable to greater than usual water erosion.
Raindrops break bare soil into tiny particles and water carries the
particles away, Pingry said.
   Fall field work is often prompted by a belief that some soil
types can be better prepared for the spring by removing crop
residue and turning the soil over, a practice Gulliford said he
does not believe is supported by research.
   Other farmers use as much time as available before bad weather
sets in to prepare fields out of fears that a wet spring will delay
planting preparations.
   ``We don't feel there's proven economic evidence that fall
plowing pays off,'' Gulliford said.
   While Iowa farmland was saturated with moisture when last
spring's planting season began, a report Monday said only 2 percent
of the subsoil and 46 percent of the topsoil had adequate moisture.
A year ago, 81 percent of the subsoil and 90 percent of the topsoil
had adequate moisture and an additional 10 percent of the subsoil
and 8 percent of the topsoil had surplus moisture.
   In Minnesota, the year's heaviest weekly rain fell last week and
was quickly soaked into the ground. Unlike downpours in normal
times, there was very little standing water in fields.
   In North Dakota, topsoil moisture is only 17 percent adequate
and subsoil moisture is just 2 percent adequate. In Missouri,
topsoil is 60 percent short of moisture.
   Stewart Melvin, an agricultural engineer with Iowa State
University, said fall tilling could interfere with how much
moisture gets back into the soil.
   ``The drought has already done the deep tillage work. The cracks
in glacial till soils will let a good rain infiltrate deep into the
soil and recharge moisture levels. You want to leave those cracks
open,'' Melvin said.
   Glacial till soils, deposits formed by the passage of glaciers,
are found throughout north-central Iowa.
   What's got conservationists concerned this fall is that the
rapid harvesting will leave lots of extra time available for field
work.
   Normally by this time of year, just 9 percent of Iowa's corn and
7 percent of the state's soybeans have been harvested.
   But this year's corn crop already was 36 percent harvested at
the start of the week, and the soybean crop was 30 percent
harvested.
   With the harvest out of the way, an industrious farmer might
begin field work for next spring, said Pingry.
   ``We definitely would encourage them not to do this,'' he said.

<HEAD>`After 2{ Long, Hard Years,' Controllers Ready For Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mission Control was a sea of quiet
and prelaunch preparation today, but ``after a long, hard 2{
years'' an air of expectancy engulfed the center of the nation's
manned space program.
   A lockdown of the control room last week put a freeze on any
equipment changes and only authorized personnel _ a few controllers
babysitting the Cape Canaveral countdown _ were allowed in today.
   Flight controllers have been given several days to adjust their
body clocks because many must work through the night during the
four-day mission. At 4:30 a.m. Thursday, a full team is to assemble
at their Johnson Space Center consoles to guide Discovery into
orbit a few hours later.
   The flight will put NASA back in the shuttle business after 32
months. Mission Control takes over command of the mission just as
the shuttle clears the launch tower in Florida.
   ``There's a sort of `let's do it now' attitude,'' said Steve
Nesbitt, the public affairs officer here who was at the microphone
when the Challenger blew up January 1986. ``It's been a long, hard
2{ years for people throughout NASA.''
   Some almost can't believe the time has actually come.
   ``This is much like the excitement before STS-1, the first
shuttle flight,'' said astronaut Michael Coates, who is scheduled
to fly Discovery in February. ``Everybody you pass in the hall, the
first question is, `How's the countdown going?'''
   Said Tim Pelischek, an engineer here: ``You hear people say that
they've been waiting 2{ years for this and then, all of the sudden,
it's just three days away and they can't believe it. I think it's
more real to the flight director people. But I think people are
getting excited about it finally.''
   After working seven years at NASA, Pelischek finally gets to see
a launch. He worked on the new escape system for Discovery and was
to go to Kennedy Space Center to help troubleshoot last-minute
problems.
   A small crew of flight controllers are monitoring the countdown
at Kennedy, checking communications equipment and keeping track of
weather conditions.
   Other controllers come in periodically to check documents they
will need and to assemble creature comforts such as coffee cups and
trash cans.
   ``They're going to be living out of that room for the next
week,'' said Brian Welch, a spokesman at Johnson.
   Outside the center, merchants are expecting an increase in
business as hundreds of journalists from around the world gather to
cover the four-day mission.
   As of Tuesday, 152 journalists registered here. About 2,400
broadcast and print journalists have signed up to come to the
center but officials expect that many of them actually will cover
the mission from Kennedy and then fly to Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., for the landing.
   In the surrounding community, business signs carry greetings for
Discovery's five crew members, and residents eagerly await the
liftoff.
   ``I am naturally very excited and very optimistic about the
flight. You can't put your finger on it, but there's always a
certain amount of excitement here when we're ready to go into
space,'' said Irene Kochiss, who lives in nearby Friendswood.
   ``Of course they are going to be fine,'' she said, adding: ``Of
course I'll say a prayer for them.''

   The dollar closed lower againt the Japnanese yen
Wednesday, while share prices moderately rose on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 134.20 yen, down 0.38 yen from the previous
day's close of 134.58 yen. After opening higher at 134.70 yen, the
currency traded between 134.20 and 134.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 165.81-point
winner Tuesday, gained another 252.45 points or 0.92 percent to
close at 27,752.01. On Tuesday, the index cloed at 27,499.56 points.
   ``The market's doing even better than yesterday (Tuesday), and
investors are actively trading a variety of issues, in addition to
big ones such as steels and real estate,'' said a dealer with Daiwa
Securities in Tokyo.
   Trading had picked up considerably since Tuesday, the first day
of the new fiscal year for most Japanese companies, said the
dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's higher opening rate to the
currency's strength overnight in the United States. They said a
lack of fresh market-affecting news also stabilize the dollar.

   From portable toilets to souvenir stands
and first aid stations, the Space Coast is geared up for the
tourists who are coming to watch the shuttle launch _ and maybe
spend some money while they're at it.
   ``Nobody's ever ready for something like this, but we are more
prepared than we have ever been in the past,'' said Ralph McMullen,
director of the Brevard County Tourist Development Agency.
   The county's 8,300 hotel-motel rooms and 4,000 campsites are
filled, the roads are heavy with traffic, and restaurants and
merchants for 50 miles up and down the coast are doing a booming
business. And today is only T-Minus One, the day before the nation
is scheduled to resume its space program.
   Tourism officials and business people are ecstatic. Their
``Green for Shuttle Go'' program is turning out to mean greenbacks
as well as the green lapel bows being worn by residents and
visitors alike.
   But all is not peachy.
   Police and transportation managers warned of traffic deadlock by
the time the shuttle is due to lift off at 9:59 a.m. Thursday.
   Traffic backups are expected into the next county on State Roads
50 and 520 and the Beeline Expressway as county and local officials
expect the mass of visitors to equal or surpass other launch
crowds, including the Apollo moon missions and the first shuttle in
1981. Some advance estimates of this week's crowd have reached 1
million, twice the number here for the first shuttle flight.
   ``We're excited about the launch. I love space. I'd love to be
on the flight,'' said Cletus Schiermann, here with his wife,
Dorothy, from Webster Groves, Mo.
   Hotels as far away as Daytona Beach and Orlando were getting
business from space buffs, and many of the tourists are expected to
be stuck on the highways at launch time.
   ``The majority of the time, traffic is going to be at a
standstill,'' said sheriff's Lt. Vernon Weekly.
   At least 250,000 people are expected to vie for viewing spots
along the banks of the Indian River in and around Titusville, the
self-styled ``Gateway to Space'' that's home to 43,000 residents.
Cars, vans, and motor homes have already staked out choice areas.
   All of this means ``megabucks,'' says Joe Catrambone, executive
vice president of the Titusville Area Chamber of Commerce.
   And if the launch is delayed, extending visitors' stays and
bringing in more tourists this weekend? ``We could double or triple
what we could take in,'' Catrambone said.
   On top of the free-spending tourists, a record 5,000 journalists
have been accredited and most are expected to be here, far
surpassing the previous high of 2,700, NASA officials said.
   ``The media are spending money everywhere,'' said McMullen.
   Then, of course, there are the invited VIPs, who will have to do
little of the sweating in getting around or the worrying and
jostling for good viewing spaces.
   About 2,000 of them, including at least 50 members of Congress,
actor John Travolta, former astronauts and a Saudi Arabian prince,
will watch the liftoff from a special NASA VIP site seven miles
from the launch pad. Another 2,000 overflow invitees will be on the
NASA Causeway.
   The destruction of shuttle Challenger 2{ years ago is far from
forgotten in this area that depends on a healthy space industry for
much of its livelihood. But the prevailing sentiment is optimism.
   And it's just like old times for some veteran bartenders, too.
At Rainbows restaurant and bar in Cocoa Beach, they are serving a
red, white and blue concoction made up of grenadine, cocoa creme
and a mint-flavored blue liqueur.
   They're called ``Shuttle Shooters.''

   Space shuttle launches had become such a matter
of course by the morning the Challenger lifted off 2{ years ago,
only the Cable News Network and NBC's West Coast version of
``Today'' had live coverage.
   The network news divisions have rediscovered the space program _
if only temporarily _ and will all have live coverage of the
Discovery launch, scheduled for 9:59 a.m. EDT Thursday. Even the
network anchors will be on the scene in Florida.
   ``If they go back to taking off like 747s heading for Paris,
we'll go back to a protective stance fairly quickly, I would think.
But this is a major first, and it's going to be covered very much
like the first shuttle launch,'' said ABC News Vice President Jeff
Gralnick.
   ``It's the U.S. going for the gold,'' said Ed Turner, executive
vice president of CNN. ``It's a huge gamble to re-establish
ourselves as a force in space.''
   Presuming a smooth launch, the networks probably will not stay
on the air for more than an hour or so. ABC and CBS are going on at
9:30 a.m. NBC, which is covering the Olympics, will break in just
before launch.
   The attention to Discovery is natural, since it is the first
manned U.S. space shot since Challenger, but it remains to be seen
whether the networks will continue to find the launches compelling
enough for live coverage. CNN will continue to cover space shots
live, since they are, as Turner said, ``a natural'' for an all-news
network.
   ``What I'm curious about is how sustained will the interest
be,'' he said. ``Will the interest, as reflected by the television
ratings, be for just that one spike, or will there be sustained
interest in the space program as it once had? I tend to think there
won't be. We've sort of done it before, and this is a return to
glories past. Nonetheless, we're covering the hell out of this
thing.''
   Though they didn't go live nationally in 1986, the other
networks had protective coverage in case anything went awry. When
Challenger exploded, they immediately broke into regularly
scheduled programming and stayed on the air for hours as the
tragedy sank into the public consciousness. The coverage cost the
networks a combined $9 million in lost advertising revenues.
   ``We had begun to believe, and I think we were wrong in
believing this, that shuttle launches were becoming routine,'' said
Lloyd Siegel, executive producer of NBC News' special coverage.
   ``While everyone has every expectation that this launch and
succeeding launches will be safe and successful, Challenger showed
us you cannot take this sort of thing for granted.''

<HEAD>Report: Settlement Proposed In L'Ambiance Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An apartment building that collapsed last
year would be rebuilt and the families of the 28 workers killed
would share in the profits under a settlement proposed by a
mediation panel, a newspaper reported today.
   The proposal to settle cases stemming from the April 23, 1987,
collapse of the L'Ambiance Plaza in Bridgeport is contained in a
memorandum written by the panel and obtained by The Hartford
Courant.
   ``I have heard about it, and I think it is an excellent idea,''
said Joe Eagan, business manager of the Iron Workers Union in New
Haven, which lost seven members in the collapse.
   The panel, named in a bid to settle all litigation in the case,
is composed of U.S. District Judge Robert C. Zampano and Superior
Court Judge Frank S. Meadow.
   Lawyers representing the families and workers met with the
judges last week and accepted the proposal, according to the
memorandum, dated Sept. 21, the Courant reported.
   The panel met with defendants' attorneys Tuesday to outline the
settlement proposal. Those attorneys have until Friday to respond
to the proposal, the Courant reported.
   ``On Friday, hopefully we will have something a little bit more
concrete,'' Meadow said.
   Attorneys familiar with the case who asked not to be identified
told the Courant they didn't know what was the total amount of
money available for the settlement. But they speculated it could
range from $20 million to $30 million for the plaintiffs, with an
additional $20 million for other damages and for settling contract
disputes.
   The memorandum said the judges are still working to include $5.1
million in the settlement for proposed federal safety fines. The
fines were levied against the contractors by the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   The building was partially erected when it collapsed. Federal
investigators blamed the equipment used in lifting huge concrete
floor slabs into position, a construction method known as lift slab.
   According to the proposed settlement, the building would be
reconstructed under a court trusteeship. Part of the income and
profits from the project would be distributed among the families of
those killed and the 14 injured workers, according to the
memorandum, the Courant reported.
   ``I love that idea,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
whose district includes Bridgeport. ``First and foremost, the
victims need compensation, and there is not much to go around. But
secondly, this would be a very important thing for Bridgeport, to
have this meaningful project come out of the ashes.''
   Before the accident, the building was hailed as a symbol of
rebirth for the old industrial city.
   Under the plan, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, which
financed the building, would finance the reconstruction. An
attorney for the agency refused to comment Tuesday to the Courant.
   The meetings with the defendants included representatives of the
companies and government agencies that participated in the project.
   At the closed-door meetings, the judges told each defendant what
they were expected to contribute, participants told the newspaper.
The judges also applied pressure in a bid to avoid years of
litigation, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Sprinter Returns To Canada</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with quotes from Johnson on Seoul to New York
flight.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Ben Johnson spent his homecoming in seclusion,
without the Olympic gold medal and the hero's welcome, as Canadians
bemoaned the fate of the sprinter who failed the drug test.
   Returning to Canada on Tuesday, Johnson, 26, dodged reporters
and the public, refusing to talk about the muscle-building and
illegal steroid Stanzolol found in his system after he won the
100-meter dash as the world's fastest human.
   But on the flight from South Korea, he denied using the drugs
even though Olympic officials said the results were indisputable.
   ``I got nothing to hide,'' Johnson told The Boston Globe during
the flight to New York, where he then boarded another plane for
Canada. ``I don't want to tell no names, but somebody's smiling
today.''
   ``It's not the only thing in life to win a gold medal,'' Johnson
said. ``I still have my parents. My family still loves me.''
   Stripped of the gold and banned for life from Canadian teams,
Johnson cried in the back of a limousine that whisked him to his
mother's home in suburban Toronto after the grueling trip from
Seoul.
   ``There's no gold now, just disappointment,'' said Boyd Plaxton,
26, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, one of 200 people on hand when
Johnson's plane landed.
   ``If he had come home with the gold in tact, there would have
been a million people here,'' Plaxton said.
   Chaos spoiled a gilt-edged moment for a man who had run 100
meters in the fastest time ever, 9.79 seconds.
   Johnson, surrounded by a phalanx of security guards, ducked into
a car and made a mad dash for the door when he arrived at the
house. But he apparently forgot his key and had to return 20
minutes later with his shirt over his head.
   Johnson spent the 1 hour, 40 minute flight from New York in the
plane's cockpit to avoid reporters.
   On the way to New York, however, he stayed in the passenger
cabin, appearing calm throughout the flight, the Globe said.
   As passengers realized who he was, some sought autographs. A
group of flight attendants swarmed around Johnson for a photo.
   ``First I was shocked, but after a while, I don't care,''
Johnson said when asked what he felt after he was informed he had
failed the drug test.
   In Canada, a parade in his adopted hometown was canceled, and
promoters backed out of deals or announced their ties with the
sprinter would expire quietly.
   Sports Minister Jean Charest said Johnson had tested negative
for drugs in August and had passed eight tests in two years. He
called the stripping of the medal a ``national embarrassment.''
   Johnson's family and close friends also denied he took steroids
   ``I know my son doesn't take drugs. I know he hasn't done it. I
know it,'' said his father, Ben Johnson Sr., from Falmouth,
Jamaica, in an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail.
   ``Ben loved mom too much to discredit her in any way,'' said his
sister, Claire Rodney, of suburban Toronto.
   Johnson had dedicated his gold to his mother, Gloria, and the
Canadian people. It was surrendered to Canadian Olympic officials
before the family left South Korea on Monday.
   ``Right now he's just relieved to be resting at home. He wants
to be with people who love him now, not the hypocrites who
abandoned him,'' Ms. Rodney said outside her mother's house.
   ``He looks great. Being at home is the best medicine for him,''
said Ms. Rodney. ``My brother is not a druggie.''
   His personal physician, Dr. George Astaphan, also said no
steroids were dispensed.
   ``I never gave him any, and he never told me he took any,''
Astaphan said in an interview in a baggage claim area.
   Hundreds of Canadians rallied to the sprinter's side.
   Police escorted a woman to the door of Johnson's mother's home
so she could deliver a card with more than 1,000 signatures from
Canadians ``who sympathized with your personal devastation.''
   In Toronto, a group of restaurant employees chipped in about
$350 to charter a plane that circled the city with a banner
proclaiming: ``We believe you, Ben.''
   In Montreal, Johnson's fans said they were disappointed.
   ``The last flicker of hope just died,'' said Danny Planetta, who
was watching TV at a bar when he heard Monday night that Johnson
had tested positive for steroids.
   ``When he won, we won and we were raving about it ... The guy
was a hero and now he is just a big disappointment.''

<TEXT>
   Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, in favor
again in Washington after a past alliance with the communist Khmer
Rouge, is expected here next month for meetings with President
Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz.
   Sihanouk will meet with Reagan Oct. 11 and Shultz the following
day on prospects for peacefully ending the 10-year Vietnamese
occupation of his country, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said Tuesday.
   Sihanouk, who in the 1970s condemned ``American Imperialism''
and lived in exile in China and North Korea, ``has been the leading
symbol of Cambodian nationalism during the past 40 years ... and
the United States strongly supports him,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   Sihanouk met Shultz in Thailand last July, the same month he
resigned as president of the anti-Vietnamese resistance coalition
in Cambodia, which included the Khmer Rouge.
   Mrs. Oakley said he continues to lead ``one of the two
non-communist groups struggling to free Cambodia from Vietnamese
aggression and his leadership has been an important element in
rallying the Cambodian people and strengthening international
opposition to Vietnam's illegal occupation.''
   She said the United States insists on complete withdrawal of all
Vietnamese troops and ``restoration of genuine self-determination.''
   Sihanouk, 65, has been in and out of favor with the United
States and in and out of exile the past two decades.
   Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in 1978 and forced the Khmer
Rouge from Phnom Penh after almost four years of brutal rule.
Vietnam earlier this summer said it had withdrawn about 13,000
troops and plans to have the last of the estimated 100,000 soldiers
stationed in Cambodia removed by 1990.
   Sihanouk started patching up relations with the United States in
a 1980 Washington visit that included talks at the State Department
and with members of Congress and Cambodian refugees.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Years of neglect and wanton commercialism
of Fisherman's Wharf could be dead in the water, according to a $23
million plan to revitalize the waterfront.
   The plan was announced Tuesday by a coalition of city officials,
fishing interests and residents, and comes years after the wharf
became a commercial dock for T-shirt shops and souvenir hawkers,
tainting its once shining reputation as a thriving Gold Rush-era
fishing village.
   ``Thirty years I've been waiting for this,'' said Pat Flanagan,
head of the committee that helped develop the plan.
   ``People don't come to San Francisco to look at secretaries in
the high-rise buildings,'' quipped Flanagan, who owns Standard
Fisheries on the wharf.
   At a news conference, Mayor Art Agnos announced that marketing
studies conducted for the Port of San Francisco indicate that
fishing industry improvements at the wharf can be financed without
revenues from a commercial development.
   The preceding mayoral administration had proposed funding
improvements at Fisherman's Wharf from the construction of a
high-rise hotel on Pier 45.
   ``At one time, it appeared that this vital industry was going to
be allowed to die because of lack of investment in modernization,''
Agnos said. ``I am delighted we have, at last, been able to develop
a plan for preservation and expansion of our fishing industry.''
   Under the plan, which officials hope to begin by 1990, the Hyde
Street Pier would be converted into a working pier for fishermen,
containing 88 new berths for active commercial fishing vessels and
transient berthing.
   The pier also would have a three-berth marine fuel station, a
work dock and hoist, a convenience store, restrooms and showers for
fishermen.
   The study by a consulting team showed that enough industry
demand for space on the pier exists to make fish handling viable.
   ``The fishing industry believes a wharf address will enhance the
marketability of their product,'' said Carol Brown, one of the
consultants. ``They foresee developing a product trademark _
`Fisherman's Wharf Seafood' _ that will have the same appeal as
`Fisherman's Wharf Sourdough.'''
   She said the project will cost an estimated $22.8 million, with
the funds to come from state and federal grants, revenues generated
from the plan and perhaps an outside developer.
   ``Our studies show that individual businesses can thrive here,''
Brown said. ``The bay area is a very large market for fresh fish,
and the diversity of our population provides a market for fish
products that do not have mass appeal elsewhere.''
   The plan is under review by the Citizens Advisory Committee of
the Fisherman's Wharf Redevelopment Project. The committee's
co-chair, Chris Martin, said this project will succeed where others
have failed because of the city's commitment to the fishing
industry, instead of merely commercial interests.
   ``This is without question, without compromise,'' explained
Martin, who also manages The Cannery at the wharf, a complex of
shops and restaurants. ``The other (proposal) was conditional on
the hotel.''
   Along the wharf, plastic carvings of sailors and rugged
fishermen have replaced the real thing, and neon signs promoting
every conceivable tourist-type item permeate the waterfront.
   However, tourists still flock to one of San Francisco's most
popular attractions, though at times they come away disappointed.
   ``It's kind of touristy along the strip,'' said Derek Schroder,
of Tucson, Ariz., visiting the Wharf on Tuesday. ``But we like the
restaurants here.''

<HEAD>Opposition Leaders Meet with Avril; No Accord on Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's new military leaders met
with three former presidential candidates and agreed to restore the
constitution but balked at setting an election date, a spokesman
for one candidate said.
   ``The government seems to desire the advancement of the
democratic process,'' said Claude Roumain, political director for
Marc Bazin, one of the former candidates.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, Haiti's new president, and Sgt. Joseph
Heubreux met Tuesday with Bazin, Gerard Gourgue and Louis Dejoie
Jr., local radio stations said. The three former presidential
candidates belong to a pro-democracy group called Committee for
Democratic Understanding.
   They asked Avril for a return of the constitution, which was
approved by referendum but later suspended by Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, who was ousted as Haiti's leader in a Sept. 17 coup by
lower-ranking members of the Presidential Guard.
   Avril, administrative head of the army under Namphy, was named
president by Heubreux and other coup leaders. Heubreux is believed
to be running this impoverished Caribbean country in concert with
Avril.
   ``The principle of a return to the suspended 1987 Constitution
was admitted by the new government. Amendments will be considered
only when a new duly elected legislature is in session,'' Roumain
said.
   ``Our points of view differ, however, on a date for elections.
The Committee and the Military Government agree, nevertheless, that
the date will be set by an independant Electoral Council, and not
by the de facto government,'' Roumain added.
   Avril and Heubreux have met with other political factions but
have set no timetable for bringing democratic rule to Haiti.
   Haiti was ruled for nearly three decades by dictators Francois
``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and then his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier. The younger Duvalier was swept from power by a popular
uprising in February 1986 and fled to France.
   Namphy, exiled now to the Dominican Republic, led a provisional
government after Duvalier's departure that was interrupted for four
months in June by the civilian presidency of Leslie Manigat.
   Manigat was elected in military-run balloting that was boycotted
by the most popular presidential candidates and marked by
widespread irregularities.
   What might have been the nation's first free elections in 30
years were thwarted last November when armed thugs killed at least
34 people at polling stations.

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
today while share prices closed higher on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Following Tuesday's 165.81-point gain, the 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average gained 225.10 points shortly after the market opened
and closed at 27,752.01, up another 252.45 points, or 0.92 percent.
   The trading was hectic with volume on the first section
estimated at 1.8 billion shares for the second straight day, the
largest amount since July 15 when more than 2 billion shares were
traded.
   ``Because the new financial year started, investors who had been
pessimistic and selling stocks regained buying interest, which
increased the volume and share prices,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama of
the Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
   Most Japanese companies began their new fiscal year Tuesday.
   Although some investors are worried about the U.S. unemployment
rate for September, scheduled to be announced Oct. 7, it was not
acting as a negative factor, Shimoyama said.
   ``The market in Tokyo has regained its energy and is in good
shape,'' he added.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed slightly lower
at 134.20 yen, down 0.38 yen from the previous day's close of
134.58 yen.
   Opening higher at 134.70 yen, the currency moved between 134.20
and 134.75 yen, unaffected by any market news, according to a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dollar gradually fell after banks in New York and Europe
sold the currency Monday to force the rate down, but ``the dollar
is unlikely to keep falling,'' said the dealer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

   A school bus driver was elected mayor of this
tiny town after the opponent who had tied him in three elections
this year moved away.
   Thomas Ledford won the election Tuesday night by an unofficial
count of 25-5 over Harold Hartman. In contests this spring and
summer, voters had split 17-17, 20-20 and 34-34 between the two.
   The winner said turnout was down this time because people got
tired of going to the polls for the same race.
   ``I'm glad it's over, and I'm certainly pleased at the
outcome,'' said Ledford, whose predecessor, Mayor Hattie Mae
Shelton, is resigning because of health problems.
   Hartman, Ledford's only opponent, sold his farm and moved this
month to Excelsior Springs, five miles away. Although his name
appeared on Tuesday's ballot, he would not have been eligible to
serve had he won. The town council would have had the authority to
appoint a mayor.
   Stories about the town's troubles in getting a mayor were
reported in newspapers from Washington state to Washington, D.C.
   ``It really put us on the map,'' said Kenneth Schneiter, one
Mosby's 280 residents. ``Whenever I say `Mosby,' people say,
`That's the town that's trying to get the mayor.'''
   Ledford said he's eager to put the campaign behind him and get
on with city business, such as organizing more social events for
town youth and having oil sprayed on gravel roads to keep the dust
down.
   ``When the publicity is over, everyone is going to forget that
the city of Mosby exists,'' he said. ``We'll be a forgotten little
city that carries on as usual.''

   Police shoved and beat people in the Lithuanian
capital as they prepared to protest the forced incorporation of
their republic into the Soviet Union, a witness reported.
   Valdas Analuslias, a Lithuanian nationalist who attended the
rally, said about 300 people gathered Tuesday in a square of
Vilnius to advertise a demonstration scheduled for today.
   About 100 policemen moved in, shoving and pushing some of those
gathered.
   Two middle-aged women shouted, ``Freedom to Lithuania,'' and
police attacked them, beating them on the ground as dozens of
people watched in horror, Analuslias said by telephone.
   The women were taken away, apparently to the local office of the
state security agency, the KGB, he said.
   The crowd did not disperse and sang religious songs.
   Several prominent Lithuanian activists were unable to leave
their homes because they were surrounded by police preventing them
from attending today's rally, which was scheduled to begin at 6
p.m. (11 a.m. EDT), Analuslias reported.
   The activists planned to demonstrate against a secret protocol
to the non-aggression agreement signed in 1939 by Soviet Foreign
Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von
Ribbentrop.
   Under the protocol, the two powers divided Central Europe and
the three Baltic nations of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were
assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence.
   Today's rally, which authorities banned, was called to demand
publication of the pact in the Soviet press and official
acknowledgement that Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the
Soviet Union.
   Estonian and Moscow-based newspapers published the secret
protocol last month.

   Two former military leaders and the
daughter of a national hero have emerged as the three top
opposition leaders to Burma's military autocracy. Here are brief
profiles of the leaders, including the posts they now hold in the
new League for Democracy opposition alliance.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AUNG GYI, 70, alliance chairman.
   Aung Gyi, a retired brigadier general, fought against the
Japanese in World War II, and after independence rose to become the
No. 2 man in the military after Ne Win, the armed forces leader who
seized power in a 1962 coup.
   Aung Gyi was considered a possible successor to Ne Win, but the
two men split over economic policy. Aung Gyi advocated a more
pragmatic and liberal policy than Ne Win's ruinous ``Burmese Way to
Socialism'' of complete state control.
   After resigning from government in 1963, Aung Gyi was jailed in
1965-68 and 1973-74.
   He became a businessman and owned several tea and pastry shops
in the Burmese capital of Rangoon. He re-emerged this year as the
regime's leading and most outspoken critic when he issued letters
addressed to Ne Win and other leaders criticizing the nation's
decline. The letters were widely circulated.
   ``That the country has gone from bad to worse (26) years after
the seizure of power is evident to anyone not living in a fool's
paradise ...'' he wrote in a May 12 letter. ``The country has
plunged to the bottom politically, economically and socially, the
moral decay is the most deplorable.''
   Aung Gyi's outspoken criticism got him thrown in jail at the end
of July by Sein Lwin, a hard-line supporter of Ne Win who tried to
break up the pro-democracy movement with force.
   Soon after civilian Maung Maung replaced Sein Lwin as head of
government, Aung Gyi was released Aug. 25 and resumed his
opposition activities.

   TIN OO, 62, alliance vice chairman.
   Tin Oo, a retired general widely respected by the military and
the public, was removed as defense minister and army chief of staff
in 1976 by Ne Win. At the time, he was considered the third-ranking
member of the ruling hierarchy.
   Student and labor demonstrators a year earlier put up posters
saying, ``Down with the Ne Win-San Yu Clique!'' and ``Long Live
General Tin Oo!'' His popularity may have been intolerable to
strongman Ne Win and his ally San Yu, who was then general
secretary of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Tin Oo was later jailed after an investigation into an alleged
plot against the government. He remained popular, however, and
emerged to address pro-democracy demonstrations in this year's
anti-government unrest.
   ``Following the recent public demonstrations against the
one-party regime, the light of democracy has now been visible,'' he
told a rally of 50,000 people in downtown Rangoon on Aug. 27.

   AUNG SAN SUU KYI, 42, alliance general secretary and spokeswoman.
   Aung San Suu Kyi is the expatriate daughter of a revolutionary
martyr assassinated 40 years ago during Burma's fight for
independence from British and Japanese imperialsim.
   She was 2 years old when her father, Aung San, was gunned down,
and she was later educated in Burma and in India, where her mother
was ambassador from 1960 to 1967.
   She obtained a bachelor's degree from Oxford University in 1967,
worked at United Nations headquarters in New York and married a
British professor of Tibetan culture in 1972.
   Her world as an expatriate housewife was turned upside down when
she returned to Burma from her home in England in April to care for
her ailing mother.
   Despite her lack of political experience, she became a leading
member of the pro-democracy opposition because her father remains
widely revered.
   ``It's like if George Washington's son had come along in 1830
and said, `I'd like to be president of the United States.' It would
have a certain ring to it,'' explained British Burma expert Robert
H. Taylor.
   In a recent British Broadcasting Corp. interview, she said, ``In
my thoughts, I have never been away from my country and my people.''

<HEAD>United States Calls Gives Plan on Third World Debt Amid Protests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady gave
world financial leaders a formula for relieving Third World debt,
and leftists smashed bank windows in a protest against the talks.
   More than 100 people were arrested during Tuesday's scattered
demonstrations, police said.
   Brady said creditors should act to slash crippling Third World
debt, but only in ways that private markets accept. He also ruled
out turning over risky loans from private banks to governments and
their taxpayers.
   ``If we embark on a course that involves the transfer of risk
from the private to the public sector, a true and lasting solution
to the restoration of sustained growth among debtor nations will
have escaped,'' he said in Tuesday's speech.
   Several hundred demonstrators on Tuesday marched from the
offices of the West German drug company Schering to a subway
station, police said. Some masked marchers hurled pieces of
pavement at the windows of a bank, said a police spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Riot police hauled away about 100 of the demonstrators, said a
police spokesman who asked not to be identified.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 160 leftist radicals threw stink bombs
and tried to block traffic to West Berlin's Tegel international
airport, police said. Four people were arrested.
   The violence followed about four hours of rioting in downtown
West Berlin Monday night, when leftist militants smashed many store
windows, dragged a car across a major boulevard, and battled with
police. About 130 people were arrested, and several protesters as
well as police officers were injured, according to witnesses and
police.
   The protests coincide with the annual meeting of the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund with most of the finance
ministers from 151 member governments attending. The sessions of
the sister organizations, which make international loans for
development projects, will continue through Thursday.
   The left-wing protesters accuse the bank and fund of
impoverishing the Third World by forcing nations to adopt austerity
measures to meet the $1.2 trillion in debt to international and
private banks as well as other governments.
   Brady, who was making his first appearance on the international
stage at the formal opening of the talks Tuesday, recommended
several devices to reduce debt. One of the most important is the
use by banks of the money owed them by debtor countries to buy
shares in industry in those countries.
   Brady left for Washington right after his speech on Tuesday
without giving any public indication whether or not he was
criticizing a proposal by Satoshi Sumita, head of the Japanese
delegation.
   Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan, outlined details of the
Japanese plan earlier Tuesday. It would convert some Third World
debt into bonds, thus further delaying repayments. The bonds would
be backed by money from the debtors themselves and held in trust by
the fund.
   The Japanese plan has been viewed as a rival to the Reagan
administration's ``Baker Plan,'' which calls in part for providing
new loans to developing countries that enact economic
liberalization policies. Brady on Tuesday defended the Baker Plan,
devised by former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III.
   Treasury Secretary Gustavo Petricioli of Mexico, whose country
is one of the heaviest debtors with bills amounting to $104
billion, appealed for still other means of reducing debt.
   Some Mexican debt was being sold last month for 48 cents on the
dollar.

<HEAD>Britain Seeks Diplomatic Ties With Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's foreign secretary says he will
meet Iran's foreign mininster this week to discuss restoring
diplomatic ties between the two nations after a year of chilly
relations.
   ``Certainly we are seeking normal relations,'' Sir Geoffrey Howe
told reporters Tuesday. ``That is one of the purposes of the
meeting'' with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, he said.
   When asked if he might announce restoration of relations after
the meeting, Howe smiled and replied: ``Watch this space.''
   Officials at the British Foreign Office in London said the
meeting would be held Friday at U.N. headquarters in New York.
   In New York, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said Tuesday
that U.S. diplomats have no plans to meet with Iranian envoys in
the city for the 43rd U.N. General Assembly.
   Last week, Britain's Foreign Office said other likely topics of
discussion between Howe and Velayati include the fate of Britons
missing in Lebanon and U.N. efforts to end the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq
war.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Britain would maintain its policy of not negotiating for the
release of hostages.
   The missing Britons include Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite,
journalist John McCarthy, and teacher Brian Keenan who is also an
Irish national. All are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
extremists, although no claim of responsibility has been made for
Waite's disappearance.
   Britain withdrew its embassy staff from Tehran last year after
an Iranian diplomat was arrested on shoplifting charges in Britain
and after Iranian militants beat a British diplomat in Tehran, the
Iranian capital.
   But British-Iranian relations have thawed with Iran making
overtures to Britain and other Western nations after agreeing to an
August cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War. London sent a British
trade officer to Tehran's trade fair this month, and British
diplomat David Reddaway visited Iran for three weeks in August.
   At a news conference in New York, Shultz was asked if U.S.
diplomats might meet with the Iranians during the General Assembly.
   ``There's no plan or nothing that I know of that would bring
such a meeting about,'' Shultz said.
   He said the United States and Iran carry on dialogue through
other nations that handle their interests in Washington and Tehran.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus Hits Victim A Minute, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS will strike 150,000 more people around the
world this year, more than in all previous years combined, an
independent report said.
   The report released Tuesday by the independent study group,
Panos Institute, also said the virus that causes AIDS appears to be
spreading at the rate of one victim a minute worldwide.
   The study, ``AIDS and the Third World,'' said an increasing
number of countries are imposing AIDS-related restrictions on the
entry of foreigners or citizens returning from abroad.
   ``Worldwide, it seems likely that a new person becomes infected
with the HIV (AIDS) virus every minute,'' said the 200-page report.
   ``During 1988, 150,000 new cases of full-blown AIDS are expected
_ as many as are thought to have occurred in all the years of the
epidemic so far.''
   Last week, Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of the World Health
Organization's AIDS program, said in Vienna that he estimates 1
million new AIDS cases will be reported within the next five years,
a number consistent with the Panos Institute's projections.
   However, he provided somewhat different numbers for the total
AIDS cases worldwide. He said said 111,000 cases have been reported
to the health organization so far. But he estimated the total
number of cases in the world is at least 250,000.
   Between 5 million and 10 million people are infected with the
virus but have not yet developed AIDS, he said.
   AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, weakens the body's
defenses against disease. It is spread primarily through sexual
contact and the sharing of syringes by drug addicts. In countries
where blood is not screened, it can also be spread through blood
transfusions. No cure has been discovered.
   By mid-1988, 176 countries had joined the World Health Network's
AIDS reporting network, 138 had reported cases of the disease and
151 had established national AIDS committees, the Panos Institute
report said.
   Measured by the number of victims per million inhabitants, the
report said the worst affected country is French Guyana, on the
northeast coast of South America, with 113 reported cases among its
82,000 people.
   Of the 20 most heavily stricken countries, 19 are African or
Caribbean, the study said. The other one, the United States, is
fifth on the list with 65,780 cases in a population of 244 million.
   By June 1988, 29 countries had imposed AIDS-related restrictions
on the entry of foreigners or citizens returning from abroad _
double the number for the preceding 12 months, the report said. But
it said research on restrictions has frequently run into
conflicting information.
   Those listed as having restrictions are Belgium, Belize,
Bulgaria, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Egypt,
Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, Mongolia, Papua
New Guinea, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
South Yemen, the Soviet Union, Syria, Thailand, the United Arab
Emirates, the United States and West Germany.

   The Soviet basketball team today
defeated the United States 82-76 in an Olympic grudge match,
breaking a U.S. basketball winning streak that began in 1972.
   It wasn't the best of days for Carl Lewis either. The American
lost his bid for a second consecutive gold medal grand slam when
Joe DeLoach beat him by less than a stride in the 200 meters,
leaving Lewis with a silver medal.
   Lewis already has a gold in the long jump and was awarded the
100-meter gold when Ben Johnson was disqualified for taking
steroids.
   The Soviet basketball victory advanced to the team to the
gold-medal game.
   ``I am very happy, and thank you United States basketball,''
said coach Alexander Gomelski, whose team played several U.S. pro
and college teams as it tuned up for the Olympics.
   As it did 16 years ago in Munich, this U.S.-Soviet matchup came
down to the final few seconds.
   At one point, the Soviets led 51-37, but the Americans trimmed
it to 79-76 with just three seconds left.
   But after a Soviet free throw, the Americans were hanging their
heads on the bench while the Soviets exchanged high-fives.
   Danny Manning, most valuable player of Kansas' national
collegiate championship last spring, didn't score a point.
   ``I don't know what to say,'' said Manning. ``I had a chance to
do some things out there, but things just weren't falling
together.''
   David Robinson led the Americans with 19 points and 12 rebounds.
   In 1972 at Munich, America met the Soviet Union for the gold
medal, and, after the final three seconds were played twice because
of referee error and a scoreboard malfunction, the Soviets won
51-50.
   So angered was the U.S. team that it refused to accept the
silver medal. This time, the Americans can win a bronze medal.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev opened talks with longtime
East German leader Erich Honecker today after they toured a Moscow
exhibit of East German products, Tass said.
   The official news agency said the talks between the Soviet
leader and Honecker, who arrived in Moscow on Monday, would cover a
wide range of issues relating to Soviet-East German relations as
well as international questions.
   The agency gave no further details.
   Earlier, the leaders toured a Moscow exhibition where the wares
of more than 180 East German firms were displayed.
   Tass indicated the Soviets were keenly interested in studying
the example of East Germany, whose industrial products are widely
regarded as the best in the East bloc.
   Gorbachev has consistently pressed for production of more
consumer goods and higher quality in Soviet-made products.

<HEAD>Couple Back Home From Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unemployed couple who defected to the Soviet
Union a year ago in search of a better life are back home and
determined to claim what they say were incentives from the U.S.
government to return.
   ``By Monday, we will be broke, so we are going to move into the
U.S. Courthouse (in Erie) to live,'' Theodore Branch, 42, said
Tuesday from a small motel here.
   Branch and his wife, Cheryle, 40, said that after Soviet
officials gave them a furnished apartment and jobs at Radio
Moscow's North American Service, officials at the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow offered them the same benefits plus help resolving their
troubled finances if they returned to the United States.
   But State Department officials in Washington said the Branches
were offered only the same loan available to any stranded U.S.
citizen to finance passage to the United States.
   ``They made promises there, and now they are backing out,''
Branch said.
   The couple will look for work but do not plan to stay with any
of their relatives in the area because ``it's not up to our
relatives to take care of us,'' he said.
   The Branches moved to the Soviet Union last October because ``we
were so mad at the U.S. government, but not at the people.''
   ``We're really mad now,'' he said.
   Branch said that after arriving in Moscow, the Soviets asked
them to visit the Embassy because American officials were worried
about them. He said they refused because ``we vowed we would never
step inside another federal building. They weren't worried about us
there, why would they be worried about us here?''
   The Soviets asked them in February to assure the U.S. Embassy
that they were not being held against their will. Branch claims
that during a subsequent meeting, Jill Farrelly-Byrnes, the
embassy's second secretary and vice consul, said ``Do you need
money? We have jobs for you. We have a place for you to live and
medical care.''
   At an August meeting, the embassy officials said they could not
help solve their problems unless the Branches returned to the
United States, he said.
   No one greeted them in Washington as promised, Branch said.
   ``I think we have been deceived. We have been stripped of
everything,'' said Mrs. Branch. ``It is hard to believe that in a
democratic society, two people could be in such a predicament.''
   The Branches want to be reimbursed for their $3,000 airfare to
return home and for their motel room.
   ``We wouldn't be here looking for a job if they hadn't promised
us,'' Branch said.
   Branch said they might return to the Soviet Union, but are
``tired of moving back and forth across the ocean at somebody's
whim.''
   The troubles that made the Soviet Union look good included the
couple's inability to collect $10,000 in back wages from Central
Florida Broadcasting Co. despite a federal court judgment in their
favor. The two had worked for a radio station run by the company,
which filed for bankruptcy reorganization.
   Land they owned in Erie County was declared part of a flood
plain by the federal government and is worthless, Mrs. Branch said.

   A pilot crash-landed a stolen plane in
foggy Golden Gate Park after apparently dropping anti-Reagan
pamphlets on San Quentin Prison, authorities said.
   ``I've got political news: There's more people to vote for than
just (presidential candidates Michael) Dukakis and (George) Bush,''
the uninjured student pilot, Allen Dale, said as police took him
into custody Tuesday.
   Dale told the San Francisco Examiner in an interview published
in today's editions that he was a Vietnam combat veteran who was
troubled by what he called the Reagan administration's failure to
determine the fate of service personnel missing in Southeast Asia.
   ``Reagan and evidently Bush ... promised the families of the
MIAs and POWs that he would make it an A-No. 1 national priority to
get remains and search for survivors,'' Dale said in the telephone
interview from jail.
   Police did not say whether Dale was licensed to fly solo.
   The 40-year-old San Francisco man was arrested shortly after his
landing for investigation of stealing the single-engine plane from
Palo Alto Airport. He was carrying a backpack filled with political
pamphlets.
   ``It was material about wanting to get Reagan, Meese and Bush,''
said police officer Barry Cooper.
   Some people said pamphlets had been tossed out over the
Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, which the plane also buzzed, but
police could not confirm the reports.
   The 1979 red-and-white Bellanca Citavria had ``Nasty Nancy'' and
other anti-Reagan slogans painted on it. It was not damaged except
for a bent propeller, said Cooper.
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators examined the plane
and found that it had fuel in it and no apparent engine defects.
   ``It kind of points to the fact he did it (crashed it) on
purpose,'' said FAA spokesman John Evans.
   Police Sgt. Jerry Senkir said the pilot faced possible
additional charges for carrying what authorities suspect was a
false passport and for landing in the park.
   Scattered around the landing site were leaflets titled
``American Revolution 1988.''
   ``We the peoples of the Army Air Corps (A Team) are arming to
demonstrate disapproval of the criminals in Washington and to save
the planet Earth NOW!,'' said the pamphlets.
   The tracts called for the impeachment of President Reagan, Bush
and a number of other political leaders.
   About 15 minutes before the plane's crash landing, an
unidentified small plane dropped ``numerous'' radical pamphlets as
it flew over San Quentin, 15 miles north of San Francisco, said
prison Lt. Cal White.
   ``It (the plane) came out of the fog, very, very low,'' said
prison spokesman Vernell Crittendon, adding that astounded inmates
and guards scooped up the material.
   No one was injured when the plane Dale flew crash-landed on the
park's Polo Field. The plane had been reported stolen earlier in
the day by the West Valley Flying Club.
   Joyce Dowling, who was jogging in the park, said the pilot was
wearing an Army-issue field jacket and boots.
   ``The (plane's) tail end was straight in the air,'' said
Dowling. ``It bounced about three times before it landed. ... We
just thought the guy's got to be hurt, but he wasn't.''
   The plane is an older-style aircraft normally used for aerobatic
stunts.
   Dale was about halfway back to Haight-Ashbury on foot when
officers in a truck apprehended him.

   Soldiers are sealing off urban areas to
prevent students and Buddhist monks from fleeing to border regions
to carry on the fight for democracy, arrivals at this frontier
rebel camp said today.
   ``There are tens of thousands of students and monks who want to
leave the cities but cannot,'' said Ko Ko, a 35-year-old teacher
from Rangoon who arrived Tuesday at this camp of about 500 ethnic
Karen rebel soldiers next to the Thai border.
   Gen. Saw Maung, who seized power in a Sept. 18 coup, ended weeks
of massive pro-democracy demonstrations last week by ordering
troops to fire on protesters.
   The official death toll since the coup is about 350, although
Western diplomats believe more people have been killed.
   On Tuesday, Burmese who fled to the rebel stronghold of Ghay Baw
Bo, said they saw soldier summarily execute unarmed protesters who
took to the streets to agitate for democracy.
   Soe Hlaing, a 36-year-old lawyer from Pegu, said he saw nine
people executed by soldiers on a bridge in the town of Tharrawdy
during his flight to the Karen-controlled areas.
   ``Each was shot with a gun. One bullet to the heart,'' Soe
Hlaing said.
   A student from the Rangoon Institute of Technology said he
witnessed the ``sysematic killing'' of 10 persons in Mudon, south
of the coastal city of Moulmein.
   Many anti-government student leaders have gone underground to
escape the brutal suppression, fleeing from military-controlled
cities to wild, frontier areas controlled by ethnic rebels who also
are fighting the central authorities.
   In Kle Day, Ko Ko said ``the army is blocking routes. We came
here because the army is killing students.''
   He said troops are manning roadblocks in Mangladon district of
Rangoon and Kyaito district of Pegu, about 40 miles northeast of
the capital.
   Students have been forced to take detours and are traveling at
night to avoid the checkpoints, said Ko Ko, who has been writing
underground anti-government pamphlets under a pen name since 1975.
   About 270 students have straggled into Kle Day, and Ko Ko quoted
them as saying they plan to take up arms to fight the clique that
has repressively ruled Burma for 26 years and crippled the
country's economy through isolationist economy policies.
   ``We cannot fight with simple weapons,'' said Ko Ko, pointing to
hand-made catapults, sharpened bicycle spokes known as ``jinglees''
and swords. He said students reaching the frontier who have formed
an All Burma Students Democratic Front will try to get arms from
other countries, he said.
   Min Ko Naing, one of the top student leaders in Rangoon, left
the capital the day after the coup and plans to join his
compatriots at the border region, Ko Ko said.
   The Karen army's vice chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Tamala Baw, said
he received instructions from Karen leader Mo Bya that 200 students
will leave Kle Day for Ghay Baw Bo, about 40 miles away, to receive
military training with another 400 students already there.
   Other students will go to bases closer to military installations
in the country's interior, he said.
   Tamala Baw said the Karens will ask international organizations
to help feed the Burmese students escaping to the regions under
rebel control.
   This border area is controlled by the Karen National Union,
which claims to field 17,000 guerrillas and is allied with nine
other rebel groups under the National Democratic Front. The front
does not include the Burma Communist Party, which wages its own war
against the central government from bases along Burma's border with
China.
   The Karens and other minorities have denounced the Rangoon
government for breaking promises to allow them greater autonomy
under a federal system of government which strongman Ne Win
abolished after seizing power in 1962.
   Ne Win resigned in July, but is widely believed to still lead
the government from behind the scenes.

<TEXT>
   China's ruling Communist Party issued a strong
warning today to its 47 million members to end reckless spending
and graft, which have plunged the nation's 10-year-old economic
reform program into crisis.
   The party, which of late had preached a more relaxed line
allowing some criticism of central policies, published a front-page
editorial in its paper, the People's Daily demanding unity and
discipline.
   ``The individual must submit to the organization,'' it said.
``The party Central Committee and State Council have repeatedly
ordered reductions in the scale of capital construction, and
forbidden party and government organs to do business. But these
still go on to an unbearable extent.''
   The editorial said: ``Those who don't abide by the party's
discipline must be punished.''
   The warning came as the party's policy-making Central Committee
met for a third day in Beijing's Great Hall of the People to
approve a two-year moratorium in price reforms and other measures
to reduce inflation of more than 20 percent.
   The meeting of the 175-member committee is closed and there has
been no word on its proceedings since Monday, when the official
Xinhua News Agency said the session opened with delivery of a
report by party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   The highest inflation in two decades, intermittent panic buying
and hoarding, a late summer run on banks, and widespread
profiteering have convinced party leaders that the economy is out
of control and that a pause in economic reform is needed to restore
order.
   A party work meeting before the Central Committee session
announced that restoring order would be the main task of the next
two years, putting planned price and wage reforms on hold.
   Xinhua said Zhao reiterated this decision in his report.
   The People's Daily editorial emphasized the importance of the
new policy and the need for united action to achieve the top
leadership's goal of modernizing the long stagnant economy by
replacing cumbersome central planning with market mechanisms.
   The party insists it has not deviated from this long-term goal.
   Although China's worsening inflation is in part due to loose
central bank control and the overissuing of currency, a major
factor has been the failure of provincial and local officials to
comply with repeated orders to approve fewer loans and spend less
money on new office buildings and imported luxuries.
   Most of the purchases of cars, televisions, computers, furniture
and expensive appliances that have boosted national consumer
spending to record levels in recent months have been made by
government offices and state-run factories.
   Officials, including party members, also have contributed to the
economic problems by engaging in black market profiteering and
graft. Party discipline and morale, which never recovered from the
leftist purges of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, has crumbled in
the face of the get-rich-quick temptations presented by China's new
prosperity.
   The People's Daily lectured, ``Our party is the faithful
representative of all China's peoples. We cannot become ... a party
of just one region, just one department or just one work unit.
   ``The party's central leadership always comes first.''
   This emphasis on discipline and central leadership ``does not
contract the development of democracy,'' it added, maintaining that
strong central discipline is necessary for openness and reform.
   The editorial did not specify what punishment would be meted out
to party members who disregard the call to fall in line.
   It also gave no indication whether the Central Committee plans
steps to remove the economic temptations that have led to
widespread corruption.
   For example, with prices only semi-decontrolled, many goods can
be bought both at low prices in state stores and high prices on the
free market. A common trick is to buy large quantities of an item
at low state prices and resell them for profits on the free market.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Makes Surprise Visit To Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher made a surprise visit to strife-torn Northern Ireland
today amid intense security against a terrorist attack.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who escaped an IRA assassination attempt at a
1984 conference of her governing Conservative Party, was to meet
businessmen and members of the security forces in several areas of
the province.
   For security reasons, the Northern Ireland office said no
advance information on her itinerary would be released.
   Danny Morrison, publicity director of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal
political wing, said the fact that Mrs. Thatcher could only visit
Northern Ireland when her travel arrangements were kept secret and
when she was guarded by thousands of soldiers and police ``shows
how vulnerable she feels and just how tenuous is British rule
here.''
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army is fighting to oust Britain
from predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite the
province with the Roman Catholic Irish Republic under a socialist
government.
   The IRA has stepped up its attacks on British soldiers this
year, killing 27 in Northern Ireland, mainland Britain and
continental Europe.
   In the October 1984 IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton,
where Mrs. Thatcher and several hundred Conservative Party members
were staying, five people were killed.
   A huge security operation swung into action when Mrs. Thatcher's
plane touched down at the Andergrove Royal Air Force base outside
Belfast this morning.
   Accompanied by her husband, Denis, and Northern Ireland
Secretary Tom King, the Cabinet member responible for the province,
she traveled to Londonderry, the province's second largest city.
Her first stop was at the Desmonds shirt factory, which earlier
this year announced a major expansion.
   Mrs. Thatcher's visit was her second to Northern Ireland in less
than a year. Last November, she attended a memorial service in
Enniskillen for 11 people killed when the IRA bombed a
commemoration ceremony for Britain's war dead.

<TEXT>
   A stoic Dutch soldier left behind
by his unit during NATO maneuvers guarded a bridge in the West
German countryside for five days, a newspaper said today.
   Sympathetic local villagers brought food and drink to Dutch
soldier Johann Romers, 19, who last week refused to leave his post
at the Leine River in northern West Germany, The Stars and Stripes
newspaper said.
   The guard became especially noticeable to West German police
after other Dutch soldiers had left the area, said the U.S.
military's authorized unofficial publication.
   ``That's what I call obedience,'' the Darmstadt-based newspaper
quoted police officer Siegfried Meyer as saying. ``I thought that
kind of discipline had died out.''
   Meyer first became concerned about the soldier on Sept. 21, when
the NATO exercise Free Lion was wrapping up, Stars and Stripes said.
   Meyer had first noticed Romers standing guard at the bridge on
Monday (Sept. 19), the newspaper said.
   ``On Thursday he was still there, although the Dutch had left
the area. On Friday, he told me his unit must have forgotten him,
and I called the military police, who came and picked him up,'' the
newspaper quoted Meyer as saying.
   The soldier, from the Dutch town of Spykenessen, had been
assigned to guard a bridge over the Leine River in the small
northern town of Freden, the Stars and Stripes said.
   Freden is located 37 miles south of Hanover.

<TEXT>
   A few dozen Soviets browsed through thousands of
hard-to-get American books, such as a handbook on future NASA
missions, Alex Haley's novel ``Roots'' and an atlas with maps of
their own country.
   The exhibit is the latest foreign joint venture to offer Western
products for the foreign currency that few Soviets are permitted to
hold. Soviets can order the books by mail from publishers.
   Despite the currency limitations and the exhibit's
out-of-the-way location _ behind two gates in a corner of an
international exhibition hall _ the American organizers were
grateful for dozens of Soviets evaluating their wares at the
opening Tuesday.
   ``It ain't Gorky Street,'' a popular Moscow shopping area,
acknowledged Martin Levin of the firm Cowan, Liebowitz and Latham
of New York.
   But Gorky Street is next on Levin's agenda. He hopes a store
that accepts Soviet rubles will open within a year.
   Only the few Soviets with hard currency legally obtained through
such means as a trip abroad will be able to order books from the
exhibit, said Dmitry Mamleev, deputy chairman of the State
Committee on Publishing, Printing and Book Trade.
   The yearlong exhibit will cater to Soviet libraries and
businesses with hard currency. U.S. publishers chose to send
largely scientific and technical works sought by Soviet
institutional customers.
   American fiction was nearly absent. The handful of volumes
included Haley's ``Roots'' and Tom Wolfe's ``The Right Stuff'' and
``The Bonfire of the Vanities.''
   The books can be ordered for the regular U.S. price plus 10
percent, but most customers will have to wait as long as four
months for delivery, according to the Soviet government's
distributor, the International Books agency.

   Vandals or thieves are suspected of
causing a spill of 1,000 gallons of highly toxic nitric acid at an
abandoned dynamite factory that forced the evacuation of up to 500
people, company officials said.
   An ugly, yellow-brown cloud hung over Hercules and the adjacent
town of Rodeo for about two hours Tuesday before dissipating.
   A spokesman for Hercules Properties, owner of the former
Hercules Powder Co., said the leak in this town about 20 miles
northeast of San Francisco apparently started when someone
attempted to steal the valves from two stainless steel tanks.
   ``An unauthorized person got into the plant, inside the fence,
and they tried to remove the valves,'' said spokesman Tom Stewart.
``We're certainly going to call on the police to investigate.''
   He speculated someone might want to salvage the stainless steel
that the six-inch valves are made of.
   A firefighter who was overcome by the fumes was treated and
released at Doctors Hospital in Pinole.
   The spill forced the evacuation of 300 to 500 people from
businesses, homes and a school.
   Lt. Bill Spencer of the Hercules-Rodeo Fire Department said fire
crews sealed the valves, and people were allowed to return to their
homes and businesses after the cloud dissipated.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha
celebrated 10 years in power today and said he felt ``fighting
fit'' with no plans to retire soon.
   Botha, 72, was elected prime minister on Sept. 28, 1978. That
post was abolished in 1984 under a new constitution, and he became
president.
   In an interview with the state-run radio network, Botha said
South Africa had ``great possibilities'' if its people could unite
and ``replace violence with deliberation.''
   Asked to appraise his accomplishments, he replied: ``Nobody ever
achieves what he sets out to achieve. I'm satisfied I've made some
progress.''
   In the radio interview and an interview published in Beeld, a
pro-government newspaper, Botha said highlights of a decade in
power included strengthening of the security forces, prospects of
improved relations with other southern African countries, efforts
to bolster the private sector of the economy, and reforms that have
eased some racially discriminatory laws and given blacks a larger
political role.
   Among the low points, he said, were intensive criticism of South
Africa by many Western countries and a split in his own Afrikaner
community because of right-wing opposition to his reform program.
   Asked by the radio interviewer if he was thinking of retiring,
Botha said: ``Not at this stage. I'm full of vigor.''
   Several newspapers today reported speculation that Botha would
soon make another trip into black Africa. One possibility is Zaire,
where President Mobutu Sese Seko has proposed a regional summit
meeting to discuss the war in Angola and other matters.
   Two weeks ago, Botha held his first summit meetings in black
Africa, traveling to Malawi, a longtime friend of South Africa, and
Mozambique, a longtime adversary.
   Domestically, Botha has come under mounting criticism in recent
years both from right-wing whites, who feel his reforms are
excessive, and from blacks and white liberals who say they are
inadequate.
   The president advocates increased power-sharing with blacks but
wants the white minority to retain ultimate political control and
maintain segregated schools and neighborhoods. He opposes a
one-person, one-vote system for the black majority.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper reflecting the views of
moderate business executives, described Botha in an editorial today
as a ``flawed leader'' who had backed away from a chance to push
the country toward substantive political change.
   The Citizen, a pro-government daily, this week praised Botha as
``the Great Reformer.''
   ``He may have been tough, ruthless, unbending at times, but he
also has been powerful, steadfast, forward-looking and prepared to
risk political reverses for the sake of what he believes,'' said an
editorial in The Citizen.

<HEAD>Twenty-Eight Parties Register For November Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-eight parties have registered for
Israel's November elections, many of them splinter groups and
single-issue factions with little hope of winning one of the 120
seats in Parliament.
   One group is headed by a diamond polisher who threw a hand
grenade into Parliament in 1957, wounding Israeli leaders Golda
Meir and David Ben Gurion.
   Another party is led by a Jerusalem news vendor whose single
mission is better housing for army veterans.
   ``In each election we have a few strange guys,'' said Sarah
Yitzhaki, spokeswoman for the Parliament or Knesset. ``This is the
price of democracy.''
   Israel's electoral system encourages the formation of small
parties, and in the 1984 balloting, Israel's nearly 3 million
voters had a choice between 26 different parties. Fifteen won seats.
   When registration closed at midnight Tuesday, 28 parties had
entered their ranked lists of candidates, election officials said
today. Seats in Parliament are assigned according to the number of
votes the party wins.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc registered
its list after a last-minute struggle over the placement of two
candidates, members of the tiny Rafi-Ometz group.
   Earlier this month, five Likud members asked the Supreme Court
to cancel an agreement in which Likud promised two safe slots for
Rafi-Ometz to lure them into the fold of the bloc. The Likud
members dropped their appeal Sunday under pressure from Shamir.
   In a demonstration of unity, Rafi-Ometz member Zalman Shoval on
Tuesday joined the Likud delegation presenting the list to the
Central Elections Committee.
   Another registrant was Moshe Duak, 54, who was sentenced to 15
years in prison after throwing a hand grenade into the Parliament
building in 1957.
   Duak, who refused to discuss the incident, said his Topaz Party
would fight for the rights of Sephardim, or Israelis of North
African origin.
   Duak said he walked across the country, often sleeping outdoors,
to collect the 1,500 signatures needed to register a list.
   He pulled a tattered folder containing 2,144 signatures out of
his red backpack and told the committee: ``I don't have a phone,
but you can leave a message at the place where I'm studying.''
   Parties were also required to pay about $7,700 to register.
Benzion Koren, whose ``Movement for the Homeland'' seeks better
housing for army veterans, sold his Jerusalem news stand to foot
the bill, Israel radio said.
   Koren ran unsuccessfully twice before. He sold his restaurant in
1981 and his coffee bar in 1984 to enter the race.
   All 14 parties currently represented in the Knesset have entered
the 1988 race, including Labor, Likud, Orthodox religious parties,
the leftist Mapam, the centrist Shinui and the right-wing Tehiya
party.
   The elections committee will now examine the applications and
announce Oct. 12 whether they are valid. The panel will also
consider demands that three groups be kicked out of the race.

   Radical students demanding the release
of a jailed leader battled police with firebombs and clubs today
and threatened to disrupt Olympic events.
   About 200 students attacked police in a brief clash at Korea
University after a rally to demand the release of Oh Young-shik, a
top radical leader charged Tuesday with violating national security
laws.
   In a separate incident, police arrested film workers who
occupied a cinema house to protest independent distribution of
American films in South Korea.
   About 50 local directors, producers and other film workers
demonstrated against the screening of ``Fatal Attraction,'' the
first American picture distributed directly in Korea by American
dealers. No injuries were reported.
   At Korea University, students pelted police with scores of
firebombs, and some attacked with wooden clubs. Police fended off
the blows with shields, but some officers were hit by firebombs and
their clothes set on fire.
   ``Why are the Olympics being staged when democratic figures are
behind bars?'' students chanted. ``Release imprisoned students.''
   No injuries or arrests were reported.
   Korea University is in northeastern Seoul about 15 miles from
the Olympic Park where the Games, which end Sunday, are being held.
   Student leaders said they will resume violent protests to secure
Oh's release. Leaders said they had planned to refrain from
violence during the Olympics, but would now retaliate for the
arrest.
   Oh was arrested Sept. 22. Authorities say he organized major
anti-government demonstrations during the summer. Radical leaders
have threatened to disrupt Olympic events, including the marathon
on Sunday, if Oh is not released.
   Radical students protesting the government of President Roh
Tae-woo have mounted anti-Olympic protests to demand the Games be
shared with communist North Korea. But just a handful of students
have turned out for the mostly peaceful protests. Most South
Koreans want the Games to be a success and are critical of the
radicals.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to
co-host the Games was rejected by the International Olympic
Committee. The committee said the Games are awarded to a single
city and cannot be shared.
   Film protests also halted operations today in theaters in two
other cities, Pusan and Kwangju, according to the Yonhap news
agency. Yonhap said about 70 film workers demonstrated in front of
another Seoul theater with fewer than 20 visitors inside.
   American filmmakers are being allowed to distribute movies
directly to South Korean cinemas under trade liberalization
measures. South Korean film workers charge direct film distribution
by U.S. exporters will ruin the South Korean market.

<HEAD>Oswald's Widow Says He Didn't Act Alone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years after the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald's widow says she now
believes Oswald did not act alone in the killing.
   ``I think he was caught between two powers _ the government and
organized crime,'' said Maria Oswald Porter in the November issue
of Ladies' Home Journal, published Tuesday.
   Testimony by Oswald's widow, who married Dallas carpenter
Kenneth Porter in 1965, helped the Warren Commission conclude that
a deranged Oswald acted alone in the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination.
   ``When I was questioned by the Warren Commission, I was a blind
kitten,'' she said.
   The commission, appointed to investigate the assassination,
concluded it was the work of a single gunman, Oswald. But in 1979,
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, relying in part on
acoustical evidence, concluded a conspiracy was likely and that it
may have involved organized crime.
   Since then, Mrs. Porter, 47, has drawn new conclusions.
   ``I don't know if Lee shot him,'' she said. ``I'm not saying
that Lee is innocent, that he didn't know about the conspiracy or
was not a part of it, but I am saying he's not necessarily guilty
of murder.''
   ``At first, I thought that Jack Ruby (who killed Oswald two days
after the assassination) was swayed by passion; all of America was
grieving,'' she said. ``But later, we found that he had connections
with the underworld. Now, I think Lee was killed to keep his mouth
shut.''
   Mrs. Porter said that in retrospect, Oswald seemed
professionally schooled in secretiveness ``and I believe he worked
for the American government.''
   ``He was taught the Russian language when he was in the
military. Do you think that is usual, that an ordinary soldier is
taught Russian? Also, he got in and out of Russia quite easily, and
he got me out quite easily,'' said the Russian-born Mrs. Porter.
She had emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1961 after marrying
Oswald, who had defected to the Soviets and then changed his mind
and returned to the United States.
   In the months preceding the assassination, a man posing as
Oswald reportedly appeared in several public places in the Dallas
area.
   ``I learned afterward that someone who said he was Lee had been
going around looking to buy a car, having a drink in a bar. I'm
telling you, Lee did not drink and he didn't know how to drive.
   ``And afterward, the FBI took me to a store in Fort Worth where
Lee was supposed to have gone to buy a gun. Someone even described
me and said I was with him. This woman was wearing a maternity
outfit like one I had. But I had never been there,'' she said.
   Mrs. Porter said she hopes the truth will emerge when the Warren
Commission materials are declassified.
   ``Look, I'm walking through the woods, trying to find a path,
just like all of us,'' she said. ``The only difference is, I have a
little bit of insight. Only half the truth has been told.''

   Four Mexicans were arrested and more than
1,500 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $140
million was seized when authorities raided a warehouse, federal
officials said.
   The arrests were made Tuesday, a day after the cocaine was first
discovered by U.S. Customs Service inspectors during a routine
check, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Ralph Lochridge
said.
   The four were arrested for investigation of importation,
possession and distribution of cocaine, Lochridge said. He said
authorities were searching for other suspects.
   The drugs were believed shipped from Colombia to Mexico and then
to California, Lochridge said.

<HEAD>Rocket Attack On Afghan Capital Kills 35, Tass Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan rebels today fired more than 20
rockets into the Afghan capital of Kabul, and one missile exploded
near a bus stop, killing 35 people and wounding more than 150, the
Tass news agency reported.
   The attack, apparently the deadliest ever staged by
anti-government insurgents on Kabul, was denounced by the official
Soviet news agency as a ``crime against the Afghan people.''
   Attacks on urban centers in Afghanistan have been mounting since
the Soviets began withdrawing their 100,000 troops from the country
in May.
   On Tuesday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told
reporters at the United Nations in New York that the Kremlin
pullout had been suspended because of persistent violations of a
U.N.-negotiated agreement.
   Tass said that in the space of one hour today, Afghan insurgents
fired 21 surface-to-surface rockets into Kabul.
   ``One of the rockets exploded near a bus stop in the center of
the city, killing 35 and wounding another 156 civilians,'' Tass
said.
   It said seven people were wounded in other parts of Kabul.
   At the United Nations, Shevardnadze said the Soviets have not
yet begun the second stage of their withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Half a Soviet force of 100,000 troops had pulled out by Aug. 15.
   ``Let's wait and see,'' he told reporters. ``It is necessary to
stop the violations that take place. It is the most important
thing.''
   In a speech to the General Assembly earlier, he asked the five
members of the U.N. Security Council to discuss violations of the
withdrawal agreement with Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   He did not name Pakistan, but the Soviet Union has filed
numerous complaints with the United Nations saying that Pakistan is
allowing the U.S.-backed insurgents to launch raids into
Afghanistan from bases in Pakistan.
   ``This cannot be allowed to happen,'' Shevardnadze said. ``We're
not complaining to anyone. We have the means to make things fall
into place. But we are responsible to the United Nations and
therefore are appealing to it.''
   Also Tuesday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the United
States and Pakistan to ``come to their senses'' and stop arming the
Afghan insurgents.
   In remarks reported by Tass, Gorbachev said Pakistan was trying
to install leaders in neighboring Afghanistan to its own liking
despite the wishes of the Afghan people.
   The U.N.-brokered withdrawal accords, signed in Geneva on April
14 by Pakistan and Afghanistan with the United States and Soviet
Union as guarantors, called for the Soviets complete its pullout by
Feb. 15, 1989.
   The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979 after an
invitation from a Moscow-backed communist government in Kabul.
   Pakistan has been a major backer of about 200,000
anti-government guerrillas, who have used it as a base of
operations. The United States and China have also lent support to
the rebels.

<HEAD>House Completes Congressional Action on Indian Gambling
Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation establishing a commission to
regulate and monitor high stakes gambling on Indian reservations
has gone to the White House following a 323-84 House vote that
completed congressional action on it.
   The bill passed by the House Tuesday provides for joint
regulation by the tribes and the federal government of bingo,
lotto, and certain card games. It would permit casinos, and horse
and dog racing on reservations only if the tribes enter into
specific contracts with state governments.
   Indian tribes, faced with cutbacks in federal money and a
limited tax base, have instituted gambling operations to raise
needed revenues. Bingo is the predominant, but not the only, form
of gambling.
   The measure would set up three classes of gaming activity, two
of which would be subject to federal regulation or monitoring.
   Class I, defined as traditional ceremonial gaming, would be left
solely to the jurisdiction of the tribes.
   Class II _ bingo, lotto, and other card games _ would be
monitored by a National Indian Gaming Commission to be established
under the bill. Card games would be subject to state regulations
regarding hours of play and betting limits.
   Class III would involve all other gambling including casinos,
horse and dog racing, and jai-alai. Tribes could engage in Class
III gambling if they enter into compacts with the state for the
operation of such games.
   The national commission would be composed of five people, three
of whom must be members of federally recognized tribes. The
president would appoint the chairman, who would need Senate
confirmation.
   The commission would be empowered to close tribal games
permanently, enforce the collection of fines, conduct background
investigations of employees, and monitor all Indian gaming
activities.
   The measure would authorize $2 million for the first year of the
commission's operation, and require that its operation be financed
at least 50 percent by the tribes, through assessments on gaming
revenues. The remainder would be paid by federal appropriations.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main opposition alliance said today it
is sending teams around the country to organize grass-roots
opposition to the powerful military autocracy that has ruled Burma
for 26 years.
   The announcement was made by the National League for Democracy,
which named retired brigadier general Aung Gyi as its chairman on
Tuesday.
   A second opposition group, made up of followers of former Prime
Minister U Nu, also has emerged to challenge the government,
state-owned Radio Rangoon reported Tuesday. The radio said the
Democracy Party was formed with Bohmu Aung as its patron and Thu
Wai as chairman.
   Bohmu Aung was a member of Burma's ``Thirty Comrades'' who
fought for independence from Great Britain during World War II. Thu
Wai was an aide to Nu when the ousted prime minister led an
unsuccessful guerrilla movement against strongman Ne Win from bases
along the Thai-Burmese border in the early 1970s.
   Two other key pro-democracy leaders _ former Defense Minister
Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burma's main revolutionary
martyr _ were named as top officers in National League for
Democracy.
   Win Htein, an aide to Tin Oo, said in a telephone interview the
alliance has started a campaign to organize at the grass-roots
level. ``We have already sent some people to the countryside,'' he
said.
   Two teams of 10 people are traveling from town to town toward
the central city of Mandalay to help organize local chapters of the
league, he said.
   The alliance will have an uphill battle against the National
Unity Party, formerly known as the Burma Socialist Program Party,
which has been the sole political party since 1962 and has a
well-established, amply funded network throughout the country.
   Western analysts say Gen. Saw Maung, who seized power in a
military coup on Sept. 18, is unquestionably behind the National
Unity Party. He ordered troops to gun down anti-government
demonstrators who for weeks had filled Rangoon's streets with
massive protest marches.
   Saw Maung has called for multiparty general elections but has
set no date.
   The government decreed Tuesday that rebels, foreign-aided
groups, the military, civil servants and ``organizations which
misuse religion'' will not be allowed to form political parties.
   Under the law, political parties will have to register with the
government to contest general elections, but none has yet done so.
   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann announced the official death toll
since the Sept. 18 coup rose to 348 people, and protesters fleeing
the crackdown on dissidents claimed soldiers had executed
demonstrators.
   The government previously acknowledged more than 250 deaths but
has not mentioned executions. Western diplomats believe troops
killed up to 400 civilians in the first days after the coup.

<HEAD>Deadline to Find PTL Buyer Extended Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. RIGSBY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL, the evangelical empire founded by
defrocked preacher Jim Bakker, must find a buyer by Oct. 14 or face
the prospect of liquidation, says the judge handling its bankruptcy
case.
   On Tuesday, bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton missed the
latest deadline to present a buyer to Judge Rufus Reynolds, saying
he needed more time to work out complicated legal details of PTL's
sale.
   ``When you get two groups of lawyers analyzing 40-some pages of
contracts, you can't always agree on what everything means,''
Benton told the judge at a hearing. ``That's why it's taking so
long.''
   Reynolds said he understands the process is complicated, but
there has to be a buyer soon.
   ``It's got to end sometime,'' he said. ``If you come in here
with no offer (on Oct. 14), it may go down the drain and it may
have to be a conversion'' to a Chapter 7 case, which means that
assets would be liquidated.
   Six weeks ago, Reynolds had said he would order PTL shut by
Saturday if there was no buyer.
   On Oct. 17, the first business day after the new deadline, the
judge will consider requests from two major PTL creditors _ Fairfax
Savings and Loan and Arthur Anderson & Co. _ for liquidation.
   At that time, he also will consider a motion to foreclose filed
by First Mortgage Investment Co. of Greensboro, N.C., which holds
the note on about 10 acres of PTL property, including the
television and radio editing facilities.
   And he will hear a request from the Internal Revenue Service to
terminate PTL's lease with Heritage Ministries, the non-profit
religious arm that was separated from PTL recently. The IRS argues
that Heritage Ministries hasn't been able to meet its rent payments.
   ``We're at the end of the road now,'' Reynolds said. ``If we
don't get a sale soon, there's not going to be anything for
anybody.''
   PTL filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. bankruptcy code in June 1987, three months after Bakker
admitted a sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and
resigned.
   Benton said he's still negotiating with Canadian real estate
executive Peter Thomas, who has offered $113 million for the
ministry's assets. He's also still talking with Steven Mernick of
Toronto and a group of investors from Washington and New York
called ``Capital Management Associates.''
   ``We're after the highest initial cash payment we can get,''
Benton said, declining to elaborate on the offers being considered.
   Earlier this month, Bakker had said he had the backing to buy
PTL for more than other prospective buyers were offering. But the
deal fell through.
   Also Tuesday, Heritage Ministries President Don Edwards said he
was resigning that post, citing dissension in the organization.
   ``My management style has been team-building. ... I can't
continue in the hostile environment that has built up,'' said
Edwards, a retired Ford Motor Co. executive.

   The Nobel committee met in secret today to
choose the winner of the 1988 Peace Prize, with President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev mentioned as leading
contenders.
   The five committee members were considering candidates drawn
from an initial list of 97. The winner will be announced Thursday.
   VG, an Oslo tabloid, speculated that Reagan and Gorbachev would
share the prize for signing a treaty banning intermediate-range
nuclear missiles.
   The paper said if they won, the leaders would hold a summit in
Oslo in December when they come to accept the award.
   Others mentioned for the $390,000 prize ranged from the U.N.
peacekeeping forces in Lebanon to the head of the International
Soccer Federation, Joao Havelange of Brazil.
   Egil Aarvik, chairman of the Nobel committee, said U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was not on the secret
list of candidates because he was not nominated by the Feb. 1
deadline.
   As stipulated in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel, whose fortune
was built on his invention of dynamite, the Peace Prize is
announced in Oslo, Norway, while the other prizes are announced in
Stockholm.
   The Karolinska Institute Nobel Assembly will announce the
medicine prize on Oct. 17. The next day the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences names the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science,
created by the Bank of Sweden in 1968 to complement the five prizes
funded by Nobel's estate.
   The winners of the physics and the chemistry prizes will be
announced by the science academy Oct. 19.
   The Swedish Academy, which awards the literature prize, does not
give a date in advance. By tradition, it announces its winner at
exactly 1 p.m. on a Thursday in September or October.
   Helge Pharo, a consultant for the Nobel committee, said the list
of candidates for the Peace Prize was reduced to fewer than a half
dozen. Pharo said the original list included 74 individuals and 23
organizations.
   The decision is by consensus. There is no vote, he said.
   Aarvik said Tuesday evening that a Peace Prize winner will be
announced at 2 p.m. (9 a.m. EDT) Thursday, making it clear there
will be a winner this year, Norwegian national news agency NTB
reported.
   Some years, the committee has chosen not to award the prize.
   Besides Aarvik, a retired journalist and former Cabinet
minister, the other committee members are author Gidske Anderson;
history professor Francis Sejersted; former Prime Minister Odvar
Nordli and Gunnar J. Staalsett, a priest and head of the
Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation.
   Last year, the committee awarded the Peace Prize to President
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica for his Central American peace plan.
   Seventeen of the 87 laureates named since the first prize was
awarded in 1901 have been Americans, more than any other
nationality.

<HEAD>Attendant On TWA Jet Says Stethem Was Brutally Beaten</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy diver aboard a
hijacked TWA jetliner was beaten so savagely before being killed
that when he was given food, he was too weak to feed himself, a
witness testified today.
   Elizabeth Howes, a flight attendant on TWA Flight 847, said she
was shaken when she saw the condition of Robert Stethem after the
beating.
   Ms. Howes said another flight attendant, Uli Derickson, helped
Stethem to the back of the plane after the beating.
   ``I was very upset to see him, and I used to be a nurse. She
(Mrs. Derickson) had to hold him by the arm, support him so he
could walk,'' Ms. Howes testified during the murder and air piracy
trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   ``I spoke to him (Stethem) one time when we were serving food.
As I handed him the tray, the Australian girl sitting next to him
said she would help him with the food,'' Ms. Howes said.
   ``I said to him `How are you doing,' and he just nodded. He was
so badly injured,'' she said.
   Stethem of Waldorf, Md., later was shot to death during the
ordeal in which 39 Americans were held captive for 17 days.
   The jet was hijacked on an Athens-to-Rome flight on June 14,
1985, and Stethem was shot to death the next day.
   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denies
involvement in Stethem's murder. Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt's
airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after customs officials discovered liquid
explosives in his luggage.
   Ms. Howes said she feared Hamadi less during the hijacking than
a second terrorist on the airplane.
   The second hijacker, known to the passengers as Said, has been
identified in a U.S. indictiment as Hassan Ezzeddine.
   ``I believe I was more afraid of Said. He appeared to be more
nervous, especially with a hand grenade in his hand. Hamadi
appeared to be more relaxed with the gun in his hand, and did most
of the negotiating,'' said Ms. Howes.
   Asked if she ever saw Ezzeddine with the gun in his hand, Ms.
Howes said: ``I don't remember. No.''
   Other witnesses have testified that Hamadi had a gun just before
and after Stethem, 23, was shot and thrown onto the runway in
Beirut.
   Asked to comment on Ms. Howes' testimony, Hamadi said: ``I have
absolutely nothing to say.'' Hamadi has often been asked to comment
on testimony without taking the witness stand.
   On Tuesday, another flight attendant said she did not believe
Hamadi killed Stethem.
   Hazel Hesp also testified that Ezzeddine boasted that one of his
friends carried out the 1983 bomb attack that killed 241 U.S.
servicemen in Beirut.
   Asked by Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger if she had an opinion
about who killed Stethem, Ms. Hesp said: ``Yes. But I did not see
the shot, so it is only my opinion. It would be my opinion that it
would be Said who shot.''
   Referring to the Beirut bombing, Ms. Hesp said Ezzeddine told
her and others on the jet that a friend of his had driven the
explosives-laden truck onto the U.S. Marine compound in Beirut in
October 1983.
   ``And he seemed to be very proud of this and told of how he
hates Americans, and wondered how non-Americans could work for an
American airline,'' said Ms. Hesp.
   Ms. Hesp also testified she felt Hamadi was taking orders from
Ezzeddine.
   ``I think Said (Ezzeddine) was the leader. He seemed to be
giving the orders,'' she said.

   Automatic weapons fire hit a civilian
jetliner carrying relief supplies and about 100 passengers over
rebel-held territory, but it landed safely, a spokesman for the
plane's owner said.
   Neither the spokesman nor a military official said Tuesday who
fired the shots that struck the Boeing 707.
   But at least two other civilian airliners have been downed by
rebel fire since August 1986, killing a total of more than 70
people.
   The spokesman for Khartoum-based Nile Safaris Aviation, speaking
on condition of anonymity, told reporters that seven bullets hit
the plane's air-conditioning system as it landed at Juba Airport
750 miles south of Khartoum. He said the plane landed safely and no
one was injured.
   The daily Khartoum newspaper al-Adwaa reported Tuesday that the
incident happened Saturday.
   The plane was carrying the passengers because of the lack of
other types of transportation to the city, where thousands fleeing
the fighting are reported in danger of starvation.
   The rebel movement took up arms against the government in 1983,
demanding autonomy in the south.
   The rebels have said they will shoot down any aircraft flying
without their permission over the south. They say the government
uses civilian relief planes for military troop movements and
resupply.

<HEAD>Six Indicted For Allegedly False Accident Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has charged six people
with trying to defraud the regional transit authority by falsely
claiming they were on a trolley involved in an accident.
   The FBI and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority said
Tuesday's indictments are part of an effort to reduce the costly
problem of fraudulent lawsuits against the authority.
   According to the indictments, all of the six sued SEPTA claiming
they were passengers in a trolley that derailed and collided with a
car in Philadelphia four years ago. The indictments charge that
none of the six was on the trolley.
   Each of the defendants is charged with five counts of mail fraud
for using the mail to further their schemes, said FBI agent John
Kundts.
   The six were identified in the indictments as Keith Hawkins, 35;
Thomas Sturgis, 35; Bryan Keith Hill, 22; Lisa Ann Williams, 25;
Edward Sneed Jr., 38; and Hyford Edward Myers, 36, all of
Philadelphia.
   If convicted, each faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail
and a $500,000 fine.
   A police officer found only one passenger on the trolley after
the accident, said Jim Kilcur, general counsel for SEPTA.
   The authority receives 12,000 to 15,000 claims a year, and
although estimating the number of fraudulent claims is difficult,
it seems to be increasing, Kilcur said.
   ``The message we want to send out is ... they're taking a
serious risk,'' Kilcur said. ``We hope a few people go to jail.''

<HEAD>Pennsylvania High Court Cancels Judicial Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania's high court has canceled
judicial elections seven weeks before the contests, saying the
state constitution dictates that the elections be held in
odd-numbered years.
   Politicians immediately expressed disappointment over Tuesday's
ruling, which came after primary races.
   ``It is unfortunate for the voters who have already cast their
primary ballots, and the candidates of both parties who have
campaigned for many months, that these elections will not be held
this year,'' said Morey M. Myers, general counsel to Democrat Gov.
Robert P. Casey.
   Republican State Chairman Earl Baker said he had hoped the court
would have allowed the campaign to go forward because candidates
had been selected in the primary.
   Four candidates who had won primary victories for respective
spots on the Supreme and Superior Court found months of campaigning
undone.
   Acting on a suit by attorney Richard Sprague, the state Supreme
Court issued the five-sentence decision saying the constitution
calls for statewide judicial elections be held apart from other
political races.
   Sprague said he learned about the issue after reading an article
by Duquesne University Law School professor Bruce Ledweitz.
   ``I knew that if it wasn't challenged now it would be challenged
by the first litigant who lost a case before the Supreme Court in
January,'' Ledweitz said Tuesday.
   Six years ago, the court, acting on a Superior Court judge's
request, permitted a Supreme Court election in an even-numbered
year, along with other political contests.
   Casey's administration said it had based its decision to hold
the election on the 1982 decision, which said statewide judicial
elections could be scheduled ``as circumstances require'' despite
separate language calling for them only in odd-numbered years.
   One Superior Court candidate, Walter Cohen, former state welfare
secretary, said he was ``disappointed, a little discouraged but not
surprised.''
   ``The biggest losers are the voters who will be without a fully
elected Supreme Court for another year,'' said Mark Keisling, a
spokesman for another candidate, former U.S. Rep. Allen Ertel, who
was running for the Supreme Court.

   Testimony has ended in a lawsuit
charging that Charleston County schools are unconstitutionally
segregated, but it will be spring at the earliest before a decision
is announced.
   The lawsuit, which was filed in January 1981 and went to trial
last October, alleges that the 1967 consolidation of county schools
fostered racial segregation.
   The consolidation created a countywide school board to oversee
the operations of eight existing local school districts. But the
consolidation left faculty and student assignments in control of
the local district boards.
   Fifty-five percent of the county's 43,512 students are black,
and more than a third of them attend classes in schools that are
more than 90 percent black.
   The plaintiffs _ the Justice Department and the NAACP Legal
Defense and Education Fund _ are asking U.S. District Judge Sol
Blatt Jr. to abolish the local district lines and order better
racial mixing of the district's students.
   The case went to trial last October and, since then, 80
witnesses have appeared in 34 days of testimony spread over 11
months. The last witnesses testified Tuesday.
   Blatt, who is hearing the case without a jury, will receive
final briefs from attorneys for both sides by late winter; no oral
arguments are planned.
   Also Tuesday, the judge ruled against a school district motion
seeking release of a 1980 memo written by the Justice Department
attorney who recommended filing the case.
   The district felt the memo, which was believed to outline
arguments both for and against filing suit, could contain
admissions damaging to the government's case.
   Portions of the memo appeared in a 1983 newspaper article, and
school district attorneys argued that since it appeared in the
press, it was no longer confidential as the Justice Department
maintained.
   But Blatt said simply because a former employee disclosed the
information, it didn't mean the government waived its right that it
was privileged.
   He added, ``I don't think this report contains any information
that is of a dire need to the school district.''
   During the trial, the school district presented testimony that
the consolidation was a financial tool that allowed poorer rural
districts to tap the countywide tax base.
   Some schools were in ``abysmal'' shape when the district was
consolidated and many failed to meet state standards, Billie
Holladay, who served as director of elementary instruction in the
county from 1968 through 1985, testified Tuesday.
   In one school, 30 elementary students were taught in a trailer
without air conditioning. In another, there were no instructional
materials for a special education class, she recalled.

   Lloyd Bentsen told students at Harry
Truman High School today that ``I'm ready'' to lead the nation, as
Truman did, if something should happen to the president.
   The same cannot be said for Republican Dan Quayle, suggested
Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential candidate. And he also
criticized Republican George Bush for choosing Quayle as his
running mate and for not being a stronger vice president himself.
   ``I think anyone who runs for vice president must earn the
respect of the American people,'' Bentsen told the students in the
late president's hometown. ``And he must enjoy the trust and
respect of his running mate.''
   ``If a presidential candidate does not choose a running mate
with those qualifications he does not respect the importance and
dignity of the office of vice president,'' said Bentsen, who will
debate Quayle next Wednesday night in Omaha, Neb.
   Bentsen, the Texas senator, recalled that Vice President Truman
became President Truman in 1945 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt died.
   ``Harry Truman was ready. Because he was smart enough,
courageous enough and loaded with the integrity necessary to lead
the forces of the free world. He was up to the job,'' Bentsen said.
   ``Like Harry Truman, I'm ready,'' he said. ``Ready to run and
serve with Mike Dukakis. Ready to help lead America to a new era of
greatness. ... And, if anything should happen to Mike, if a tragedy
should occur, I'm ready to lead America.''
   Bentsen's job on the stump generally has been to tout Dukakis
and attend events that complement those of the presidential
nominee. But, with polls showing voter unease with Bush's choice of
Quayle, the campaign decided to use the visit to Truman's
birthplace to step up its attack on Bush's judgment in choosing
Quayle and on the Indiana senator's qualifications for the vice
presidency.
   Bentsen, without mentioning the 41-year-old Quayle by name,
discussed his own experience _ noting that he met Truman during
Bentsen's first term in Congress _ to suggest the Republican was
not up to the job.
   ``Just as we expect a president to be qualified for office and
to be ready to lead America, so must we expect the same of those
who might _ like Harry Truman _ become president at a moment's
notice,'' the 67-year-old Bentsen said.
   Bentsen also likened Dukakis to Truman, telling the students
that during Sunday night's debate with Bush they saw a ``Democrat
in the tradition of Harry Truman, proud of his family and proud of
his country, talking to the people about housing and health care
and national defense.''
   And, in a swipe at Bush, Bentsen praised Dukakis for wanting an
activist vice president not always in agreement with the president
and willing to stand up for his actions.
   ``He does not want his vice president to ever hide behind a lame
excuse that he `wasn't in the loop,''' a phrase Bush has used when
saying he was not fully aware of arms-for-hostages dealing with
Iran.
   On Tuesday in Kansas City, Bentsen lashed out at Republican
trade and budget policies and invited Democrats who supported
President Reagan to ``come home to the party that cares.''
   At a rally at the Kansas City airport, he chided Quayle for
opposing legislation to give workers 60 days' notice before they
are laid off and accused the Reagan administration of sitting idly
by as America lost its dominance in the world marketplace.
   ``They've watched us exporting jobs instead of American
products,'' said Bentsen, who suggested that a George Bush
presidency would bring lax enforcement of the new trade law
designed to open up foreign markets to U.S. products.
   ``One of the messages we send out is Democrats come home,''
Bentsen said. ``Come home to the Democratic Party. Come home to the
party that cares.''
   At his airport rally, Bentsen declared that, ``Dan Quayle lost
the fight against plant closing and the American people won.''
   He also delighted the crowd of about 250 people by saying:
``We're going to open the Quayle season a little early this year.''
   Earlier, at a news conference in Detroit, Bentsen predicted
Quayle would be a formidable debate opponent. ``I think Dan Quayle
is going to do very well in the debate,'' Bentsen said. ``I'm not
so confrontational.''
   Quayle ventured into Bentsen's home state of Texas on Tuesday
but the Democrat said he wasn't worried.
   ``I have great faith in the judgment of the people of Texas,''
the senator said with a smile.

<TEXT>
   Flood waters started to recede today in
northern India, and the government said at least 282 people have
died in the week of torrential rains.
   Indian newspapers put the death toll at 350.
   Hundreds of people remained marooned in villages and towns in
the central state of Punjab. The government feared the stagnant
muddy water could cause outbreaks of diarrhea and cholera.
   ``Punjab is most likely to be affected in an outbreak of
water-borne disease,'' said the official government spokesman, who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   At least 1,500 villages in the state were under water, said J.N.
Srivastava, an official at the Flood Control Center in Chandigarh,
the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana states. At least 70,000
people have been evacuated from the villages in boats and
helicopters, he said.
   The government said today that 282 people in Punjab and three
neighboring states have died during the floods, caused by
rain-swollen rivers bursting their banks.
   In the flooded areas in central Punjab, where at least 130
people have died, hundreds of people crowded onto small islands of
high land in villages along the Sutlej River.
   ``My entire family is perched on a tree,'' said Tara Singh, a
resident of the village of Kasabab. ``I have been moving from place
to place for the past two days to get a boat, but all in vain.''
   Singh, 45, said his wife, three children and sister took shelter
in the tree after the Sutlej overflowed into the village and
innundated their mud-and-brick house.
   The Sutlej is one of three major rivers in the state. All three
continue to flow above the danger mark.
   Another flood victim, Avtar Kaur, said no boats were available
to rescue her elderly father-in-law. ``He is bedridden and has been
on the roof of our house for the past four days,'' she said. ``He
stayed on the roof despite rains because the house was full of
water.''
   There was no rain in the region today, and a senior government
official in New Delhi said flood waters had begun receding in
Punjab, Haryana, Jammu-Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh states.
   The floods started on Sept. 21 after heavy rains caused rivers
in the region to overflow their banks. The rains continued through
Tuesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
floods had damaged 1.5 million tons of the summer crop, mainly in
Punjab, India's primary producer of rice and wheat.
   India had forecast a summer crop of 97 million tons.
   Floods caused by the summer monsoon are frequent in India,
Bangladesh and Nepal. In late August, monsoon-swollen rivers
innundated three-fourths of neighboring Bangladesh. Newspapers said
2,000 people died in the floods.

   Gunmen burst into a villa today and
killed a Mafia boss and his wife, authorities said. The deaths were
the latest in a spree of gangland murders on the island.
   The killers struck around 11:30 a.m., shooting Giovanni Bontade
and his wife, Francesca, both 42, police said.
   Bontade was a defendant in the mass trial of more than 400 Mafia
suspects and was sentenced in December to eight years in prison for
criminal association. He was under house arrest pending an appeal.
   Bontade's brother, Stefano, was killed in 1981 in a war between
Mafia families.
   The killings bring to 10 the number of people slain in Sicily
this week. The victims include a prominent judge who presided over
two major trials of organized crime suspects and a well-known
leftist who campaigned against drugs and the Mafia.
   Investigators believe the killings are part of a new series of
Mafia attacks on the state, as well as a battle between rival gangs.

   A 19-year-old woman who says she
was raped by up to 23 men on the hood of a car was encouraged by a
jury's conviction of the first of 10 men to be tried in the attack.
   ``It's not over yet, but it's going there,'' the mother of two
said Tuesday, hours after a jury found Orlando Garza guilty of
sexual assault and sentenced him to the maximum 20-year prison term.
   ``I'm relieved because now it will take off some of the stress
and pain that I had,'' the woman said Tuesday afternoon at the
offices of Crisis Services, a Corpus Christi agency that has
counseled the victim and her family since the rape.
   An agency counselor who attended the trial called the woman from
the Duval County Courthouse in San Diego, a south Texas town 60
miles east of Corpus Christi, near where the rape occurred. The
counselor said she awakened the victim shortly after the jury
returned the guilty verdict at 4:15 a.m. Tuesday.
   ``It (the verdict) was right,'' the victim said, ``because I
don't want him to go and do it to somebody else.''
   The woman, her 23-year-old husband, their 22-month-old son and
10-month-old daughter moved to an undisclosed location in Corpus
Christi after the couple reported harrassment following her
accusation that 10 men took part in her abduction and rape.
   ``She's happy,'' said Barbara Jackson, the counselor who called
the rape victim with the verdict. ``She said, `Thank the Lord.'''
   The victim said the guilty verdict takes away some of her fear
of traveling in public, and increases her determination to testify
against the other nine defendants.
   The woman told authorities that as many as 23 men sexually
assaulted her on the hood of a car the night of March 26-27 after
she was abducted and taken to a ranch where an illegal cockfight
was being held. She said she later was raped at two other locations.
   Garza, 24, who faces a later trial on an aggravated kidnapping
charge, claimed the woman insisted on having sex with him twice
outside the cockfight and that they had been having an affair for
some time.
   A 12-year-old boy testified Friday that he saw the woman being
sexually attacked at the cockfight. He named all 10 men charged in
the case.

   Riot police detained nearly 300 people who staged
protests against finance talks they claim are unfavorable to poor
Third World nations, activists said today.
   A West Berlin police spokesman said 226 people were taken into
custody while protesting the joint World Bank-International
Monetary Fund talks, which began last week and end Thursday.
   Some protesters hurled stones, beer cans and paint-filled
balloons at banks and store windows Tuesday night, said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said two fires were started at gas stations in West Berlin's
Kreuzberg section during the night.
   Just before midnight on Tuesday, about 600 shield-carrying riot
police broke up a noisy demonstration by hundreds of protesters in
downtown West Berlin, witnesses said.
   Police officers raised their shields and encircled the shouting
demonstrators, then forced them to move toward a subway station,
where they were ordered to disperse, said the witnesses. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   At least five protesters were taken into custody for refusing to
obey the police orders, according to the witnesses.
   Kurt Jotta, a spokesman for a committee of activists, said 281
demonstrators were detained during various actions betweeen Tuesday
and today. He said that 106 of those held were freed by this
afternoon.
   Since Sunday, thousands of demonstrators have been protesting
what they say is unfair financial treatment of heavily indebted
Third World lands by the industrial nations.
   About 10,000 police, including 2,700 from other cities in West
Germany, are on duty in West Berlin to guard the city during the
talks.

<HEAD>Crisis Lines Face Own Crisis Because of Party Line Confusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crisis hot line for youngsters
that won a presidential award last year is receiving fewer calls
and faces a loss of funds because of confusion with costly ``party
lines,'' its founder says.
   Lorraine La Susa-Weymouth, who started Kids Line in this Chicago
suburb three years ago, said her service was running smoothly until
June 1987, when the party lines _ some call themselves ``hot
lines'' _ became popular.
   The 24-hour crisis line for troubled youths is run by
volunteers, and the only cost is the price of a regular phone call.
   The for-profit party lines allow kids to chat with several peers
at once. Young callers have frequently racked up huge phone bills
and created an uproar among parents.
   Many prevented their children from calling any hot line, and
operators who get calls from youths seeking the crisis line number
often mistakenly give them the number of a party line, said state
Sen. William Mahar, who has joined efforts to clear up the
confusion.
   Ms. La Susa-Weymouth said at one time Kids Line was receiving
1,800 calls a month, but that number has since dropped to 400 a
month. She said the confusion threatens crisis lines nationwide.
   ``Children will call us ... even if they are suicidal, and say,
`Does this cost?''' she said.
   In one instance, a teen-age boy who asked the operator for the
number of Teen Line _ an adjunct to Kids Line for teens _ was
mistakenly referred to a party line, she said. It was not until he
had started discussing his problem that the boy realized his
mistake.
   ``He was just absolutely unhinged because his peer group on the
party line made fun of him,'' she said.
   The service received a President's Volunteer Action Award in
Public Safety, Ms. La Susa-Weymouth said.
   ``Kids are being told that we're a friend they can talk to with
their problems,'' she said. ``It would be a shame if we weren't
there to listen.''
   Mahar said he has been meeting with the Citizens Utility Board
and Illinois Bell to try and iron out the confusion. He said
announcements on radio and television also are planned.

<TEXT>
   A convicted killer who asked a judge to
quickly confirm his death sentence so he could watch television in
his cell has been ordered to death row.
   Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey A. Manning formally
imposed the death penalty Tuesday on Gary Lee Starr, 47, who was
sentenced in August to die in the electric chair for murdering his
daughter. Starr said nothing during the sentencing.
   Starr was convicted of fatally stabbing his daughter, Wanda, 20,
in February after accusing her of stealing rent money. He was an
apartment complex manager in suburban Moon Township.
   Since his conviction, Starr had been writing to Manning, asking
the judge to confirm his death sentence as soon as possible so he
could watch television in his cell. He was being housed in an area
of the prison where televisions are prohibited.
   ``Please bring me in and sentence me,'' Starr said in a letter.
   Starr requested the quick action because it would put him in a
section of the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh where
televisions are permitted, prison officials said. He threatened to
stage a hunger strike if he wasn't sentenced quickly.
   Manning said the letters demonstrated Starr's ``perverse''
priorities in life.
   ``People may conclude that this man may be nuts, but I don't see
it that way,'' the judge said.
   During his trial, Starr admitted having a six-year incestuous
relationship with his daughter. Sixteen years ago, he was convicted
of fatally shooting his wife, Linda, as she slept. He served 8{
years in prison for that crime.

   Iraqi prisoners of war recently freed by
Iran said today they were systematically tortured by Iranian
Revolutionary Guards, and some said they were punished for refusing
to defect or convert to Islam.
   About 30 of 72 ailing and wounded POWs released last week told a
news conference they were constantly under pressure to defect. The
press conference was organized by the Information Ministry.
   Christians among the released prisoners said their Shiite Moslem
captors tried to force them to convert to Islam. Some said they had
been in captivity for six years.
   ``When I told them I was a Christian, they asked me to convert
to Islam before they would give me any medical help,'' said Wa'd
Aziz Na'mou, who said he was captured in January 1987 in the
southern Shalamcheh sector after he was wounded in the eyes during
a major Iranian offensive against the port city of Basra.
   ``I refused and they left me without treatment. I lost both
eyes,'' said Na'mou, an agronomist who was serving as an enlisted
man.
   The Iraqis were the first prisoners released by Iran since an
Aug. 20 cease-fire in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war. A full-scale
prisoner exchange, provided for under the United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire agreement, has been stalled because peace talks are
deadlocked.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has registered
50,182 POWs held by Iran and 19,284 by Iraq.
   Diplomats in Baghdad and Tehran, however, believe that Iran
holds 60,000 to 70,000 prisoners and Iraq 30,000 to 50,000.
   The freed Iraqis showed reporters injuries and scars they said
they suffered at the hands of Iranian guards in POW camps.
   Ministry officials said all 72 men freed last week were disabled
soldiers handed over at the border.
   Na'mou said Christian prisoners were isolated from Iraqi Moslem
POWs by their guards, who considered them to be ``unclean.''
   ``Many of the Christian soldiers were forced to convert to Islam
under psychological pressure and torture,'' he said.
   There are an estimated 250,000 Christians among Iraq's 16
million Moslems.
   The former prisoners said that after the cease-fire was
announced, Iranian pressure on them to seek asylum in Iran
intensified.
   They did not disclose how many Iraqi POWs defected in captivity,
but they insisted that they underwent ``unprecedented pressure.''
   ``We refused and insisted that we had to go back to our
country,'' said Ali Hussein Salman, 26, who said he was captured in
the Tiab area east of the southern Iraqi city of Amara in 1982.
   Salman said he was beaten by guards the day that Iranian
pilgrims were killed in rioting in the holy city of Mecca in Saudi
Arabia.
   More than 400 people, 275 of them Iranians, were killed July 31,
1987 in the violence the Saudis said was instigated by militant
Iranian fundamentalists in defiance of a ban on political protests
during the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
   Salman said his Iranian guards at the Takhti POW camp near
Tehran injured his skull, paralyzing one side of his face and body.
   ``When the news broke that some Iranians had been killed in
Mecca, the guards went mad,'' he said. ``They started beating us at
random. They killed three prisoners and injured many others.''
   Other prisoners spoke of being left out in the snow at night as
punishment for refusing to shout slogans against President Saddam
Hussein and his Baath Arab Socialist Party.

<HEAD>Police Ban Rightist Group From Visiting Temple Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police kept a right-wing Israeli group away
from the Temple Mount today because its visit last year caused
violent Palestinian protests at the sacred site claimed by Jews and
Moslems.
   Police officers, some armed with tear gas canisters, turned back
about 30 members of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group that demands
Jewish control over the area known in Arabic as Haram el-Sharif.
   Also today, Israeli troops shot and wounded six Palestinians in
the occupied territories, including a 10-year-old boy who was shot
in the head while playing on the roof of his home, hospital
officials said. The officials did not give the boy's condition.
   The army forced nearly 200,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip to stay in their homes after violence in the past
few days.
   In Gaza City, mourners poured into the home of Rashad al-Shawwa,
the former mayor of Gaza who died of a heart attack Tuesday at the
age of 79.
   Thousands of Jewish pilgrims, some singing and dancing, prayed
below Temple Mount at the Western Wall, the last remnant of the
temple, to commemorate the harvest holiday of Sukkot.
   Haram el-Sharif is sacred to Jews as the site of the Holy Temple
destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 and to Moslems as the place
where the prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven in the 7th century.
   The mount, dominated by the golden Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa
mosques, is administered by the Moslem Waqf, a religious
institution responsible for the care of Islamic holy sites.
   A visit by the Temple Mount Faithful to the site last year
caused violent protests by hundreds of rock-throwing Palestinians.
   Police feared that Moslem protests would be more severe this
year because of the 9-month-old Palestinian uprising against
Israel's 21-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Since
the uprising began in December, 278 Palestinians and six Israelis
have been killed.
   Gershon Solomon, head of the group, said today's ban was
``painful, humiliating and anti-Jewish.''
   ``Jews have no other holy site,'' said Solomon, wearing a
yarmulke, or head cover used by observant Jews, and flanked by
supporters holding Israeli flags. ``We can pray in New York, London
or Paris but not here. It's absurd.''
   In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded two
Palestinians from the village of Zeita, near Nablus, after a group
of youths stoned the troops, Arab reporters and hospital officials
said.
   Earlier, a 20-year-old Palestinian was shot in the left arm in
Nablus, while two other Arabs were wounded by plastic bullets in
the Gaza Strip town of RAfah, hospital officals said.
   Israel radio reported that a Jewish woman was injured when an
unidentified object was thrown at the bus in which she was
traveling in Nablus.
   The army clamped curfews on four refugee camps in the Gaza
Strip, confining over 130,000 Palestinians to their homes following
violent disturbances in the past few days. About 17,000
Palestinians in three towns and refugees camps were ordered to stay
in their homes in the West Bank.
   In Gaza City, hundreds of cars were parked outside the home of
the late mayor, a moderate Palestinian known for his pro-Jordanian
views. Members of his family set up a tent in the garden to
accomodate the mourners.

   A U.S. attorney says ``a serious inquiry'' is
needed into the ethics of lawyers representing a black teen-ager
who, a grand jury reportedly determined, lied about being abducted
and raped by whites.
   The case of Tawana Brawley led to an intensive investigation and
charges of a racially motivated cover-up.
   ``I think the way in which this case developed and the way in
which people acted is something that should be a matter of concern
for the legal profession, it should be a matter of concern for the
state,'' said U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.
   ``It's certainly worth a serious inquiry,'' he told reporters
Tuesday.
   But the prosecutor steered clear of criticizing either Alton H.
Maddox Jr. or C. Vernon Mason, the Brawley family's legal advisers.
   ``I'm not going to single out any individuals and I'm not going
to suggest that anybody did anything wrong,'' he said.
   The state grand jury investigating the case has developed
``overwhelming evidence'' that Miss Brawley fabricated the story,
The New York Times reported Tuesday.
   Miss Brawley, now 16, and her mother, Glenda, refused to testify
before the grand jury. A contempt citation was lodged against Mrs.
Brawley, but she avoided arrest and prosecution by living in a
church. Mrs. Brawley, her boyfriend and her daughter have left the
state.
   Maddox, Mason and the Rev. Al Sharpton, another Brawley adviser,
accused state and local officials of a cover-up, without providing
evidence to back up the claim.
   The Brawley family reportedly was seen leaving their home in
Virginia Beach, Va., early Tuesday in a van loaded with suitcases
for an unknown destination.
   Sharpton said Miss Brawley, her mother and the attorneys would
respond to the report within 24 hours. A news conference scheduled
for this morning was postponed until later in the day.
   On Tuesday, Sharpton called the Times article ``nothing but a
whole series of reckless speculations by someone who cannot back it
up with one iota of fact.''
   As in the past, the black activist charged that the criminal
justice system does not treat minorities fairly.
   ``Tawana is only the last race case that a grand jury has
suggested (was) a fantasy,'' Sharpton told reporters.
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams, whose office presented the
case to the grand jury, said in a statement he would not ``confirm
or deny the accuracy of any aspect'' of the Times story.
   Giuliani's office entered the case when Samuel McClease of
Jersey City, N.J., claimed to have tapes of Brawley advisers
expressing doubts about her story.
   The tapes never surfaced, McClease was charged with obstructing
justice and Brawley advisers accused Giuliani of hiring him to
secretly tape their conversations.
   The Times said the grand jury decided not to indict anyone and
by law cannot criticize ordinary citizens that it does not indict.
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28 outside an apartment complex in
which the family once lived in Wappingers Falls, 75 miles north of
New York. She was inside a garbage bag, smeared with dog feces,
seemingly dazed, and with racial slurs written on her body.
   The Times said the grand jury found plenty of evidence to show
she was not abducted on Nov. 24 as she claimed. The panel instead
determined she stayed in the nearby apartment where her family had
lived.
   It said she, possibly with an accomplice, smeared herself with
the feces, wrote the racial slurs, tore and scorched her clothes
and crawled into the bag and pretended to be in a traumatized daze,
according to the newspaper.
   It said that for weeks, she misled doctors, social workers,
police, reporters and others with medical complaints and false and
fragmentary accounts of her fabricated episode.
   The grand jury speculated that her motivation may have been fear
of punishment from her mother's boyfriend for her late nights out,
and that drugs and her relationships with shady characters may have
played a role, the Times said.
   The grand jury report is expected to be released within weeks,
the Times said.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Expels Two British Diplomats</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to ADD details, background. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia has ordered two
British military attaches out of the country for activities
``incompatible with their diplomatic status,'' the official news
agency CTK reported today.
   The expulsions came six days after Britain accused three
Czechoslovak diplomats, including two military attaches, of spying
and gave them two weeks to leave Prague's embassy in London.
   CTK named the two Britons ordered out of Prague as Wing
Commander John Maynard and Warrant Officer Graeme Addy.
   British diplomat Richard Todd said both men have been at the
Prague embassy since the summer of 1986 and were given 14 days to
leave the country.
   British charge d'affaires John Macgregor was summoned to the
Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry today and informed of the decision to
expel the two men for ``activity incompatible with their diplomatic
status,'' CTK said.
   That phrase is commonly used in diplomatic parlance to describe
activities viewed as espionage.
   On Sept. 22, Britain expelled Czechoslovakia's assistant
military attache, Maj. Bedrich Kramar, air attache Maj. Vlastimil
Netolicky and Pavel Moudry, a member of the commercial section.
   The British Foreign Office said the expulsions were a signal
that while Britain seeks better relations with Czechoslovakia, it
will not tolerate ``the sort of activities'' in which Prague's
three diplomats engaged.
   In relaying word of Czechoslovakia's expulsions, CTK used almost
identical language.
   The Czechoslovak side told Britain the activities of the two
Britons contradicted ``the interest in constructive relations
between Czechoslovakia and Britain and is an obstacle to their
further development,'' CTK said.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman denied the expelled
Britons were spies. He said the move was ``definitely a
retaliation'' for Britain ordering the expulsion of three
Czechosolvak envoys on Sept. 22.
   ``We have said we want to develop relations with Czechoslovakia,
but the action of the three diplomats in London didn't help and
this does not help either,'' the spokesman told The Associated
Press.
   ``They (the Czechoslovakian authorities) gave us the usual thing
that these men were involved in the gathering of information of an
intelligence nature,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.

   Fire raced through a house today as firefighters
struggled to break through burglar bars blocking the windows, and
three young children and two teen-agers were killed, authorities
said.
   Fire investigator Don Howard said the blaze began shortly after
4 a.m. on the city's south side.
   Firefighters got there in just a few minutes because a fire
station was not far away, but they were unable to get into the home
quickly because of burglar bars and some furniture at the
residence, Howard said. He says all the victims were found in and
around one bedroom.
   ``Just guessing, I'd say it took at least five minutes longer
getting in,'' because of the bars, said fire investigator Doug
Preston. ``It could have been longer. A few minutes can be the
difference between life and death.''
   Firefighters had to use a circular saw to enter the house,
Preston said. The bars were apparently installed before a change in
city codes required bars that can be opened from the inside, he
said.
   Beverly Handy of the Dallas County medical examiner's office
identified the victims as Jasmine Jordan, 1; Ericka Jordan, 9;
Jamal Jordan, 6; Bernard Jordan, 16; and Demetra Jordan, 18.
Officials were unsure whether they were all brothers and sisters or
whether they were cousins.
   Another child, a boy of about 9, was taken to Parkland Memorial
Hospital in critical condition, officials said, and the children's
grandmother was hospitalized for shock after learning about the
fire.
   On Tuesday, another fire killed a father and three of his
children near Camden, S.C. Authorities said it apparently was
started by one of the candles used to light the family's mobile
home after electricity was cut off the day before.
   The victims were identified as Johnny Lee Gaither, 28;
Stephanie, 4; Sheirka, 3; and Johnny Jr., 7 months. They were
pronounced dead at the scene, Kershaw County Coroner Tommy Horton
said.
   Sheriff Hector DeBruhl said the children's mother, Mary Ann
Gaither, and her daughter, 10-year-old Latasha Kelly, had gone to
an uncle's home nearby to prepare breakfast when the fire broke out.
   Mrs. Gaither returned to find the mobile home in flames. She was
unable to rescue anyone inside the home because of thick smoke.
   Her uncle, Roosevelt Wilson, said the fire ``started all of a
sudden.''
   ``It was a big blaze and we couldn't do a thing,'' he said.

   Defense motions unsealed today in the case of
Panama's military ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega charge that his
indictment on drug charges was part of a scheme to renegotiate the
Panama Canal Treaty.
   That treaty, signed during the Carter administration, turns over
control of the canal to Panama at the end of this century.
   ``There were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty,''
Noriega's attorney, Neal Sonnett, said today. ``We argue that it
was one of the circumstances leading up to a decision to attempt to
get Noriega out of power.''
   The 65-page motion requesting dismissal of the indictment
accuses the government of selective prosecution, and questions its
authority to to indict the head of a sovereign nation.
   The document, dated Sept. 14, had initially been ordered sealed
by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler at the request of
prosecutors.
   At the time, Chief Deputy U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie said he
feared the motions might contain information that could be used to
influence the U.S. presidential election.
   Noriega has claimed previously he has information that would
hurt George Bush's electoral chances.
   But Gregorie said today after reviewing the motions, he had
found nothing ``shocking'' in them, and had himself moved to unseal
the document. He said he would respond next month to the dismissal
motions.
   The document mentions several Reagan administration figures,
chiefly in citations of news accounts about the indictment, but
Bush is never mentioned.
   The 12-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in
Miami in February accused Noriega of accepting $4.6 million in
bribes from Colombia's violent Medellin drug cartel. A grand jury
in Tampa indicted Noriega on three marijuana importation counts at
the same time.
   In May, the Reagan administration offered to drop criminal
charges against Noriega if he agreed to step down, but protracted
negotiations broke down without agreement.

   Rescue workers today recovered a third
body from a six-story apartment building that collapsed in
Monterrey and continued to search for three other people believed
trapped in tons of rubble.
   The rescuers, aided by dogs, located the body of a woman. Soon
after the building collapsed on Tuesday, the body of a man and an
infant were found.
   The search continued for two women and a 19-month-old baby
believed trapped when the building collapsed and part of it fell
down a steep hillside.
   Authorities said Hurricane Gilbert may have been partly
responsible for the collapse of the 3-year-old, cement building.
State prosecutor Alejandro Garza said four people were rescued
after the collapse.
   Rescue teams dug by hand and carried out buckets of broken
concrete that had been the building's walls and floors.
   ``The goal is to preserve the life of those that may be
inside,'' worker Trevino Berchelman said. He said three teams of
dogs brought in to sniff through the rubble all pinpointed the same
area where the victims may be trapped but that concrete slabs
prevented rescue workers from searching there.
   Salinas Garcia, who was in his second-floor apartment when the
building collapsed, said he didn't realize what was happening at
first. ``I woke up and the roof was on top of me,'' he said, his
face and T-shirt covered with blood.
   Francisco Javier Nakashima, a local police investigator, said
heavy rains from Gilbert, which struck this northern industrial
city Sept. 17, must have contributed to the collapse. However, he
said neighbors also reported the structure was leaning to one side
six months ago.
   Gilbert caused widespread flooding, killing at least 140 local
people, most of whom died in buses that were overturned by flood
waters.
   Garza identified the dead man as Antonio Rodriguez, 25 to 30
years old, and said he did not know the name of the dead infant,
who was less than 1 year old.
   Hospital officials said two of the four people who were rescued
were treated for minor injuries and released from a local hospital.

<HEAD>Bush Defends Proposal for Tax-Deferred Savings Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with Bush quotes.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush today defended
his proposal for a tax-deferred savings plan while saying a college
loan program advanced by Michael Dukakis would put ``the IRS on
your tail for the rest of your life.''
   Bush made the comments at Illinois State University as he began
a 150-mile campaign swing through rural central and northern
Illinois, riding in the refurbished campaign bus that had been used
by one-time rival Pat Robertson.
   He told a spirited college rally that Illinois was ``vital to
the election'' and that he planned to be in the state ``again and
again.'' His visit followed by one day a Dukakis campaign swing
through Illinois, which holds 24 electoral votes and is viewed as
critical by both sides.
   Although Dukakis has scorned Bush's new plan for tax-deferred
savings, claiming it will save Americans no more than $20 a year,
Bush insisted his day-old proposal would ``give taxpayers a little
nest egg.''
   He slashed at Dukakis' plan for college loans that would be paid
back according to an individual's future earnings through tax
withdrawals.
   ``We do not need to put the IRS on your tail for the rest of
your life,'' Bush said. ``Under his approach, the government would
give you a loan, then take a bit out of your paycheck for the next
40 years.''
   ``He wants to spend more and I want to put more money in the
hands of individuals, not in the hands of government,'' Bush said.
   Traveling with Bush were country singers Loretta Lynn and her
sisters, Crystal Gayle and Peggy Sue Wright. Bush has been ``behind
the president, watching every move he makes. We're ready for him,''
Miss Lynn said.
   Bush also ridiculed Dukakis for driving a tank during a recent
campaign stop. ``I know what it is doing dumb things but the one
that takes the cake is him riding around in that tank,'' Bush said.
``Don't tell me he doesn't have a sense of humor.''
   Later, Bush chatted with patrons in a small restaurant and
bowling alley in El Paso, Ill., and also planned brief rallies and
stops in six other small Illinois communities.
   Bush's tax-deferred savings plan, which he calls an ``individual
savings account,'' would allow low and middle-income savers to
defray paying taxes on interest income on savings of up to $1,000 a
year so long as the money was kept in such accounts for five or
more years.
   The vice president, unveiling the plan in a speech Tuesday to
the Ohio Republican Convention, said it would help Americans be
``better able to afford a home, pay for college, or start a
business.''
   ``Americans have increasingly gotten away from the sensible
frugality that says, `put some away for a rainy day','' Bush said.
   But Bush advisers suggested afterward the plan was far less
ambitious.
   ``The idea was designed to encourage people to put money into a
savings account, that's all,'' said Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of
staff. ``It's an incentive. A little incentive.''
   Michael Boskin, a top Bush economic adviser and co-architect of
the proposal, says it would only yield about $14 a year in tax
savings for the maximum deposit.
   But, the Stanford University economist added, ``This will be an
important additional incentive for savings.''
   Dukakis was quick to attack the proposal.
   ``Twenty bucks a year _ that's Mr. Bush's solution for average
Americans,'' Dukakis said referring to his calculations. ``He says
it will make them, and here I'm quoting, `better able to afford a
home, pay for college, start a business.' Twenty bucks a year,
who's he kidding?''

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   Sept. 23
   The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on abortion:
   Supreme Court Associate Justice Harry Blackmun, author of the
1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, now
is warning the decision may not last another high court session.
   Talking in the circumspect language implicitly required of high
court justices, Blackmun hinted in a law school speech ... that
Reagan appointments, especially that of Associate Justice Anthony
Kennedy, may end Roe v. Wade.
   Blackmun is doing one of at least two things. He actually may be
warning that with the appointment of Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and
Sandra Day O'Connor, Roe v. Wade's days are numbered and so is
abortion on demand in the United States _ at least for some women
in some states.
   Or he's implicitly urging the presidential candidates to bring
the issue to the fore, so ``freedom of choice'' backers can vote
for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. Vice President George Bush opposes
abortion.
   Or he's hinting that he soon may resign from the court, and the
Senate can allow a ``right-to-life'' majority to slip in if it
isn't careful. ...
   The nation may be continuing its move to the right, enough to
restrict what was basically a 1960s abortion decision. But neither
is Congress ready to make all abortions out of reach for all women.
   Blackmun correctly sees the nation turning a corner on the
issue. But that's not the same thing as reversing one's course.

   The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch on eliminating trans-Atlantic trade
barriers:
   In 1992, exactly 500 years after Christopher Columbus charted an
important new trade route, trans-Atlantic trade will mark another
advance.
   The 12 nations of the European Economic Community have targeted
1992 for completion of 285 steps to eliminate remaining trade
barriers and thus to create a dynamic single market of 320 million
people. ...
   The marketplace has its own built-in logic. It ought to be
allowed to function with a minimum of artificial, special-interest
barriers.

   The Columbus (Ind.) Republic on air pollution:
   Those hazy days of summer are behind us. Too bad the same can't
be said for air pollution.
   According to a report ..., acid rain has landed in our own
backyard. No longer can we smugly dismiss it as someone else's
problem.
   Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide emitted by the tall stacks
of power plants and factories mixes with moisture in the
atmosphere. The six states bordering the Ohio River account for
almost 40 percent of this country's sulfur dioxide pollution.
   But prevailing winds were thought to carry the pollutants north
to Canada and east toward New England. ...
   Industry, particularly Midwestern power companies, has long
maintained that the costs of ... additional anti-pollution
equipment will drive up consumer costs while making it less
competitive.
   Those arguments sounded convincing enough when Midwesterners
thought they had little to worry about. Now there's another price
to pay.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on the state of education in the
United States:
   Do we as a nation have to worry about scientific illiteracy as
we march into the 21st century?
   The U.S. Department of Education reported last week that
American young people continue to perform poorly on science
proficiency, both in comparison with their counterparts in other
nations and in comparison with U.S. school students two decades ago.
   The study found that only 7 percent of the nation's 17-year-olds
have enough scientific knowledge to do well in college science
courses, and that more than half of Americans of that age are so
ill-educated in science that they cannot perform jobs requiring
technical skills or benefit from special job training.
   But perhaps more alarming than that, the study found that
science proficiency for black and Hispanic students aged 13 to 17
is at least four years behind the levels of white students of the
same ages, and that a considerable difference in science exists
between males and females of that age group.
   One thing is clear. All is not well with education in America.

   The Press-Courier, Oxnard, Calif., on language:
   If there was any doubt that English is a vital, continually
changing language, take a look at the Third College Edition of
Webster's New World Dictionary.
   The recently completed edition _ the first revision since 1970 _
adds 20,000 new words and definitions in an attempt to keep pace
with the restless and innovative society.
   The ruthless world of Wall Street contributed the words ``junk
bonds'' and ``golden parachutes.'' Computer technology added
another definition of boot, as in ``to load, as from a disk.'' The
Soviets gave us ``glasnost'' and weekend loafers inspired the term
``couch potato.''
   The Webster editors who decide which of the new offerings make
it into the dictionary and which don't say they reject suggestions
from children. Does that mean one of the newly included words,
``kissy-face,'' was proposed by an adult? As a Valley girl (a term
that dictionary editors considered, but rejected) might say, ``Gag
me with a spoon!''

   The Saginaw (Mich.) News on U.S. support of the United Nations:
   President Reagan's decision to pay the United Nations $532
million in back support represents a ``change of heart,'' according
to the Washington Post.
   We're not so sure. Our hunch is that the president planned all
along to eventually pay the cash, but he wanted to make a point
about bloated spending among bureaucrats and U.S. bashing in the
General Assembly.
   Reagan was right to cut off the money and he was right, if
somewhat belatedly, to pay it back.
   The United Nations still pays salaries that are too fat and
consulting fees that are too generous, but reins have been applied.
Reagan's spotlight stemmed some of the financial abuse.
   Meanwhile, the United States is gaining more respect within the
United Nations, and the United Nations is taking more steps that
favor Western interests. Tentative agreements respecting
Afghanistan, southwest Africa, the Iran-Iraq war and the
Turkish-Greek division of Cyprus are recent examples. ...
   Reagan did what needed to be done. As a result, the United
Nations' most useful years could be still to come.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on government ethics:
   The Office of Government Ethics has used the case of Edwin
Meese, the badly discredited former attorney general, to convey a
strong lesson on ethical criteria for public servants.
   In a report admirable for independence and clarity, the agency
says that ``while Mr. Meese's personal reputation could not but
have suffered as a result of this investigation (by the special
prosecutor), the public's confidence in the Justice Department has
also suffered.''
   The Ethics Office extolled the ``clarion standard ... which
exhorts an employee to avoid any action that adversely affects the
confidence of the public in the integrity of the government.''
   Meese's great fault was that he conspicuously spurned this
standard.

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on Jim Wright:
   House Speaker Jim Wright has once again exercised poor judgment

   The Texas Democrat, who in the past has sympathized with
positions of the communist regime in Managua, criticized what he
called a covert CIA operation fomenting demonstrations against the
Nicaraguan government.
   Wright denies that he arrived at his conclusions from secret

   Wright and some of his congressional colleagues like to jump on
the administration for ``not keeping Congress properly informed''

   North Jersey Advance, Flanders, N.J., on higher immigration
quotas:
   In a surprising development, the Reagan administration ...
proposed a sharp increase in admission quotas for the next fiscal
year. It wants to admit 94,000 refugees from around the world,
compared to its request last year of a limit of 72,500.
   The dramatic increase proposed is a laudable response to both
humane appeals and practical foreign affairs concerns.
   The Thais and other Southeast Asian governments, hard-pressed
financially with their upkeep of Vietnamese refugees, implore the
United States to let more of those emigrate to this country.
   And the United States has a special obligation in this regard,
because that flood of boat people stems in some degree from a
failure of U.S. policy in Vietnam.
   The administration has suppressed its budgetary concerns to
advocate this enlargement of the nation's welcome mat, and Congress
should not hesitate to vote the additional funds that will be
needed.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis said today that as president he would sign an executive
order barring top administration officials from lobbying the
government if they leave their federal posts.
   He strongly criticized the Reagan administration's conduct,
trying to turn the issue against his Republican opponent.
   ``George Bush may be satisfied with this administration's `Hall
of Shame' _ dozens of top administration officials who broke the
law and violated the public trust. He may be satisfied with letting
Japan make the cars while his former colleagues make the license
plates. I say America can do better than that,'' Dukakis said.
   ``George Bush may be satisfied with the revolving door between
the administration and private lobbying firms, where self-service
replaces public service and dishonest consultants are ripping off
the Pentagon. I say we can do better than that,'' he said.
   ``High government office is a public trust, not a training camp
for foreign lobbyists or a vehicle for private gain,'' he told a
rally in Pennsylvania. The executive order would prevent top
officials from lobbying for the duration of a Dukakis
administration.
   Dukakis said he also would issue a second executive order
``curbing agency and department contact with former members of
Congress for some period of time.''
   The Massachusetts governor said he would close what he called
the ``Deaver loophole,'' a reference to Reagan administration
officials who left the White House and began lobbying their former
executive office colleagues. Top Reagan aide Michael Deaver was
convicted of perjury for lying about his contacts with
administration officials on behalf of corporations who paid him
huge fees for his services.
   Dukakis has often criticized the Reagan administration for lax
ethical standards, but this was his first specific proposal to deal
with it.
   His proposal to limit agency contact with former members of
Congress would be certain to cause controversy on Capitol Hill.
Many former members of Congress have joined Washington law firms
and receive large retainers for lobbying their former colleagues as
well as executive-branch agencies.
   Dukakis said his executive order, which he would sign ``the day
I take office,'' would cover all presidential appointees confirmed
by the Senate and all senior White House staff, a total of about
800 people.
   Current law prohibits government officials from lobbying the
agencies or offices in which they work for one year after leaving
government service. Dukakis would broaden that and expand the time
period to the duration of his administration.
   Dukakis lost no time Tuesday attacking a George Bush proposal to
allow low- and middle-income Americans to contribute up to $1,000 a
year to tax-deferred savings accounts.
   ``Twenty bucks a year,'' Dukakis said slowly, his tone leaving
no doubt what he thought of Bush's plan to help middle class
Americans.
   ``Twenty bucks a year,'' he repeated. ``Who's he kidding.''
   Dukakis was also traveling to New York City today for a meeting
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Dukakis aide Jim Steinberg said the meeting was arranged before
the recent session between Shevardnadze and Bush, during which the
Soviet official praised the vice president for his role in recent
improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Steinberg said there was no set agenda for the meeting, but that
it would cover the ``whole range'' of U.S.-Soviet concerns.
   He said the meeting would give the two a chance to ``meet each
other and discuss common interests and concerns and to understand
better their respective approaches to U.S.-Soviet relations and
issues that affect both countries.''
   Steinberg said, ``The governor looks forward to substantive
discussions with Shevardnadze, at the same time he's going to make
clear that he's not the president of the United States.''
   Dukakis also had a meeting with French President Francois
Mitterand scheduled for Thursday morning.
   A number of foreign leaders were in New York for the opening of
the United Nations General Assembly session.
   Outlining his plan for an ``individual savings account,'' Bush
said it would allow taxpayers to ``put something away for a rainy
day.'' A Bush aide said the plan would enable small savers to defer
paying taxes on interest income on savings of up to $1,000 a year
as long as the money is kept in such accounts for five or more
years.
   The campaign said the plan, which would be available to those
with adjusted gross incomes up to $50,000, would only yield about
$14 a year in tax savings for the maximum deposit. Dukakis' aides
calculated it would add up to a $20 benefit.
   ``Twenty bucks a year, that's Mr. Bush's solution for average
Americans,'' said Dukakis.
   ``He says it will make _ and here I'm quoting him _ Americans
better able to afford a home, pay for college or start a
business,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democratic nominee juxtaposed Bush's support for a cut in
the capital gains tax with the GOP nominee's savings plan.
   ``Today, after I pointed that out to him on Sunday night, he
discovered the rest of America and he told just what his priorities
are,'' Dukakis said. ``He wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of
Americans $30,000 and the rest of us are going to get 20 bucks.
That's a new definition of trickle-down.''

   President Reagan today signed legislation
implementing the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement, saying it will
mean lower prices for consumers and many new jobs for workers.
   The Senate approved the bill on Sept. 19 by a vote of 83-0. With
the president's signature, it clears the way for U.S. action in
phasing out tariffs on $131 billion in merchandise that crosses the
U.S.-Canada border each year.
   The agreement was approved this year by the Canadian House of
Commons, but leaders of the the Canadian Senate have said they will
delay action until Prime Minister Brian Mulroney holds an election.
There is speculation in Canada that Mulroney will call an election
shortly for late November. He is four years into his term.
   Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative, is a strong supporter of
the agreement, but both opposition parties, the Liberals and the
New Democrats, oppose it. Public opinion polls show that opinion in
Canada is about evenly divided on the issue.
   Reagan signed the bill in a Rose Garden ceremony, saying, ``This
is a moment future historians will cite as a landmark, a turning
point in the forward march of trade, commerce and even civilization
itself.''
   ``That's a dramatic statement I know,'' he said, but the
agreement ``creates the world's largest free trade area'' and
``will mean lower prices for consumers, jobs galore for workers and
new markets for producers.''
   The bill calls for a 10-year phase-out of tariffs and a number
of other trade curbs under the pact signed in January by the
president and the Canadian prime minister.
   The free-trade zone would remove barriers between the North
American neighbors, but the two countries would continue to have
separate sets of tariffs and quotas on imports from third countries.
   Israel is the only country that now has a free-trade agreement
with the United States. Its volume is small compared with the $131
billion a year in goods that make Canada this country's top trading
partner.

<HEAD>Pork Producers To Seek Import Duties On Canadian Pork Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group representing the nation's hog farmers
said Wednesday it once again will seek import duties on pork
products from Canada, claiming that the Canadian meat is subsidized
and competes unfairly with American producers.
   Ray Hankes, president of the National Pork Producers Council,
said a petition asking for the countervailing duty on Canadian meat
will be filed with the Commerce Department and the U.S.
International Trade Commission.
   The announcment was made at a news conference during a three-day
legislative meeting of the council in Washington. Hankes said the
council also would seek financial support from the meat-packing
industry.
   A countervailing duty on Canadian hogs was obtained in 1985, a
move that was upheld by the U.S. Court of International Trade
during a lengthy appeals process. That import duty remains in
effect.
   But the pork producers also sought to include Canadian pork
products in the 1985 case, contending that producers and meat
packers were part of the same industry and are linked through a
continuous line of production.
   The Commerce Department ruled in 1985 that subsidies being paid
to Canadian hog farmers justified U.S. duties on imports of pork
products. But the U.S. Court of International Trade, acting on an
appeal by the Canadian Meat Council, overruled the Commerce
decision.
   Hankes said the council was successful in including an amendment
in the recent trade law that, in effect, overturns the earlier
court decision and reinstates the Commerce Department's authority
to impose duties on processed pork ``to the full extent of subsidy
payments'' made to Canadian hog producers.
   In 1985, the pork council predicted that ``if a countervailing
duty was imposed on Canadian hogs but not on pork products'' the
Canadians would simply slaughter more hogs and send the products
into the United States.
   ``That, in fact, has occurred,'' the council said. ``In 1984,
imports of pork products from Canada equaled 345 million pounds. By
the end of the current year, estimpated pork product imports to the
U.S. from Canada will total 526 million pounds. That's a 52 percent
increase since (the council's) original petition was filed.''
   Further, the council said, imports of subsidized pork are
capturing ``a growing percentage of the U.S. market and seriously
depressing U.S. hog prices.''
   The council cited a study by University of Missouri economist
Glenn Grimes showing that imports of pork products from Canada
``depressed U.S. hog prices as much as $3.81 per hundredweight
during the first six months of this year.''
   Council officials added: ``That means U.S. pork producers
suffered a potential revenue loss of as much as $393 million in the
first half of 1988 as a result of subsidized Canadian pork imports.
Gross revenue losses to U.S. meat packers are even higher.''
   The council said it ``does not seek to inhibit free trade and
competition'' between Canada and the United States but does want
``to ensure that all producers and packers, domestic and foreign,
operate under the same market conditions, undistorted by government
financial intervention.''

<TEXT>
   Failure by Israel to act quickly on an
international ruling about an occupied border area claimed by Egypt
could threaten the two countries' peace treaty, a Foreign Ministry
source said today.
   An arbitration agreement signed on Sept. 11, 1986, commits Egypt
and Israel to carry out the ruling, due Thursday from a panel in
Geneva, Switzerland.
   If, as expected, the ruling is in Cairo's favor, it would
require Israel to surrender the Taba border enclave near Elat,
Israel, which the Jewish state has held since the 1967 Middle East
war. The dispute over the 250-acre beachfront area has been a key
sticking point in Egyptian-Israeli relations. The two countries
signed a U.S.-mediated peace treaty in 1979.
   ``Any delays from the Israeli side (in implementing the ruling)
will affect the surviving peace between Egypt and Israel,'' said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   However, the spokesman for traveling Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said neither the ministry nor anybody else in the
Egyptian government would have anything to say about Taba before
the panel's decision is announced.
   In Jerusalem, an official of the Israeli Foreign Ministry said
Israel has ``no intention to get around'' the ruling ``or go beyond
the deadline.'' He noted the agreement setting up the panel allows
51 days to carry out the ruling. ``We have said we will obey
according to the letter and the spirit of the arbitration,'' he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On Tuesday, Radio Israel and other Israeli media reports said
the arbiters have decided against Israel.
   ``The ruling on Taba has to be carried out by Egypt and
Israel,'' the Egyptian Foreign Ministry source said. ``The carrying
out of the ruling does not need negotiations, but there will be
negotiations about the civilian procedures to settle the position
of the Israeli structures in the area.''
   After Israel took over the barren beach, Israeli entrepreneurs
established a modern hotel and a beach cabana on it. The reference
in the Egyptian statement was to possible compensation for the
facilities and rules governing Israeli visits to Taba.
   Israel refused to hand over Taba when it withdrew in 1982 from
the Sinai Peninsula under stipulations of the 1979 accord, Israel's
only treaty with an Arab state.

   An anonymous benefactor wadded up a

box, the vicar said Wednesday.
   The gift will enable St. Mary Magdalene Church in the

900-year-old Norman tower, one of Britain's oldest.

we were working and decided to lend a big helping hand.''
   The church already had raised $18,500 in the last 18 months, he
said.
   Church warden Tim Lusted, who found the unsigned money order
folded several times and pressed through a small aperture in the
church's wall box, said he first thought it was a hoax.
   ``But the bank confirmed it was authentic, although they can't
divulge who donated it,'' he said.

   Officials raided a suburban warehouse
Wednesday and confiscated 4,600 cans of powdered milk suspected to
have been contaminated by radioactive fallout from the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.
   Health Secretary Alfredo Bengzon, who led the raiders to a
warehouse in the Manila suburb of Paranaque, said the imported milk
was part of a shipment of dairy products returned to Western Europe
in 1986 after the accident.
   He said he ordered an investigation into how part of the
shipment was sent back to the Philippines.
   Last month, health officials also recovered more than 700 cans
of the contaminated milk that were distributed to several provinces
outside Manila.
   The local distributors of the milk product denied knowledge of
the shipment.
   An explosion and fire at the Soviet nuclear plant in April 1986
killed 31 Soviets and sent a cloud of radiation around the world.
It was the world's worst nuclear power accident.

IRNA said. No casualties were reported.
   The Richter scale measures the intensity of earthquakes. A
magnitude of 4 can cause moderate damage and 5 considerable damage.

   Thousands of Britons who bet on Ben Johnson to win
the Olympic 100-meter dash at 2-1 odds can keep their winnings,
licensed bookmakers said Wednesday.
   The Canadian was stripped of the gold after failing a drug test,
but the four major British bookmakers already had paid out by the
time the results were announced.
   That means that bettors who backed American 4-9 favorite Carl
Lewis, who was given the gold after Johnson's disqualification,
will not receive anything.
   Mike Dillon, a spokesman for Ladbrokes, compared the event with
a horse race.
   ``Once a man is given his medal, that is akin to a horse being
weighed in. Johnson's disqualification came after the `weigh in'
and, therefore, we are settling bets on first past the post,''
Dillon said.

<HEAD>Prominent Aboriginal Artist And His Family Slain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARWIN, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading aboriginal artist and four
members of his family were shot and killed at their camp in a
remote reservation, police said Wednesday.
   Police in the aboriginal area of Arnhem Land in the Northern
Territory said the bodies of tribal elder Dick Ngueli Ngueli, also
known as Muru Muru, and his wife, daughter and two young grandsons
were found Tuesday.
   Police said relatives found the five victims lying face down in
a creek at a remote camp in Arnhem Land, 180 miles east of Darwin.
   Police said a sixth victim, apparently Ngueli's brother, was
also found dead, but gave no details.
   Superintendant Terry O'Brien of the Darwin police said the five
family members were killed with a shotgun and that used cartridges
were found near the bodies.
   Police said they plan to question tribal aborigines in the area
and were searching for Ngueli's son-in-law, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
   Ngueli, about 60 years old and a member of the Namok tribe, is
an internationally acclaimed bark painter whose works are on
display at the National Gallery in Canberra, the federal capital.
   The slayings followed media reports that aboriginal elders in
Arnhem Land had started ``singing to death'' _ a ritual death curse
_ another aboriginal artist for presenting a bark painting
depicting legends of creation to Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
   The reports said Galarrwuy Yunupingu, chairman of the Northern
Territory Land Council, was condemned in June for revealing secret
tribal lore to a white man.
   Police did not link the two incidents.
   Rituals practiced by aborigines, while seldom reported, are
still common in Australia.
   During a re-enactment Jan. 26 of the arrival of the first fleet
of ships that bought convict settlers to Australia, aborigines
stood on the foreshore of Sydney Harbor pointing sharpened bones _
a symbol of imminent death _ at the incoming ships.
   Aborigines, Australia's first settlers, number about 160,000, or
1 percent of the country's 16 million population. They are believed
to have arrived at least 40,000 years ago.

<TEXT>
   The National Academy of Engineering announced
Wednesday the establishment of a major new international award for
achievement in engineering and technology that it hopes will match
the prestige of the Nobel Prizes.
   ``This award is designed to focus worldwide attention on the
critical role that engineering and technology play in improving the
quality of everyday life,'' Robert M. White, the academy's
president, said in announcing the award named after aeronautical
engineer Charles Stark Draper.
   Draper developed the theory and invented the technology of
inertial guidance systems now universally used in aircraft,
submarines, missiles and space vehicles.
   White noted that ``our society tends to reward the discoverer of
basic scientific principle but overlook the engineer who puts that
principle into practice in products and services that yield
societal and economic benefits.''
   ``We hope that in years to come, the Charles Stark Draper Prize
will be just as well-known and respected an award in engineering as
the Nobel Prizes are today for chemistry, physics and medicine,''
he said.
   According to White, the recipient of the first Draper Prize _
consisting of a gold medal and $350,000 in prize money _ will be
announced in October 1989. The award subsequently will be given
every two years.
   Endowed by MIT's Charles Stark Draper Laboratory of Cambridge,
Mass., the prize recognizes engineering and technology achievements
``contributing to the advancement of human welfare and freedom.''
   Announcement of the award came as the National Academy of
Engineering, a sister organization of the National Academy of
Sciences, held its 24th annual meeting.
   In a speech to the meeting, White called for efforts by the
government to develop a more coherent, vigorous technology policy.
   ``As a consensus emerges on the need for the federal government
to participate in the support of the nation's civil technology base
there is no recognizable or effective governmental mechanism for
doing so,'' he said. ``Whereas we have a reasonably well-defined
science structure in the federal government for support of
scientific research, a technology structure is nonexistent.''
   ``We neglect support for engineering and technology at our
peril,'' White said. ``We have a science policy, but no technology
policy.''
   Also addressing the session was MIT President Paul E. Gray, who
called for renewed development of nuclear power as a way of coping
with the ``greenhouse effect'' global warming largely caused by the
burning of fossil fuels.
   ``We must make an earnest and sustained effort to educate the
public about the risks and benefits of nuclear power in terms that
permit quantitative comparison with other energy sources,'' he said.
   In addition to achieving a solution to the problem of nuclear
waste disposal, Gray said, ``we must develop, build and test
radically different reactor designs that pose entirely negligible
risks of the accidental release of radioactive materials as a
result of overheating.''

   Radical students demanding the release
of a jailed student leader fought riot police with clubs and
firebombs Wednesday and threatened to stage violent protests during
the closing days of the Olympics.
   The radicals have been able to mount just a few minor protests
during the Games, and authorities said they could stop any attempt
to disrupt events.
   Student leaders issued their warning after about 200 radicals
battled police at Korea University to demand the release of Oh
Young-shik.
   Students pelted riot troopers with dozens of firebombs, and some
attacked with wooden clubs during the brief clash. Troopers fended
off the blows with shields, but some officers were hit by firebombs
and their clothes were set ablaze.
   ``Why are the Olympics being staged when democratic figures are
behind bars,'' students chanted. ``Release imprisoned students.''
   Police in combat fatigues and visored helmets made several
charges to push protesters back and hurled a few tear gas grenades.
   The fighting was confined to the street in front of the school's
main gate and ended when a shop hit by firebombs caught fire.
Students offered police hoses to fight the fire until firefighters
arrived.
   No injuries or arrests were reported.
   Korea University is in northeastern Seoul about 15 miles from
the Olympic Park, where the Games are being held.
   Student leaders said they refrained from violence during the
Olympics but now would retaliate for the arrest of Oh on Sept. 22.
   Radical leaders earlier threatened to disrupt Olympic events,
including the marathon on Sunday, if Oh was not released. Police
refused to release Oh and charged him Tuesday with organizing major
anti-government demonstrations during the summer.
   Park Seh-jik, head of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee,
said authorities were ready to deal with any threat from the
radicals. ``We're all prepared,'' he told reporters.
   A huge banner with a picture of Oh was hanging on the wall of
the student union building inside the campus.
   Radical students opposed to the government of President Roh
Tae-woo have staged anti-Olympic protests to demand the Games be
shared with communist North Korea.
   Just a handful of students have turned out for the mostly
peaceful protests. Most South Koreans want the Games to be a major
success and are critical of the radicals.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to be
a co-host at the Games was rejected by the International Olympic
Committee. The committee said the Games are awarded to a single
city and could not be shared.

   For the first time in six years, the
Agriculture Department is reporting on U.S. aquaculture and how it
stacks up as part of the nation's food machine.
   Overall, the department's Economic Research Service reported
Tuesday, aquaculture production has grown 20 percent a year since
1980. Production includes food and non-food fish, shellfish and
aquatic plants.
   ``Domestic production of food fish and shellfish amounted to an
estimated 700 million pounds in 1987 and was worth almost $550
million at the farm gate, compared with 203 million pounds and $191
million in 1980,'' the agency said. ``Last year, non-food
aquacultural production included, among other items, $71.5 million
of baitfish and $23 million of tropical fish.''
   As aquaculture began to move up as an agricultural enterprise,
reports were issued in 1980, 1981 and 1982, but then they fell
victim to USDA budget cuts. However, people kept eating more fish,
and commercial enterprises kept producing them.
   ``During the 1980s, Americans have substantially increased the
quantity of fish and shellfish in their diets despite the fact that
seafood prices have risen considerably faster than those for some
major competing sources of dietary protein,'' the report said.
   Per capita consumption of all fishery products rose 18 percent
to 20.2 pounds in 1987 from an estimated 17.1 pounds in 1980.
   The largest sources of U.S. fishery products are domestic wild
harvests and imports, the report said. Commercial fishermen landed
a record 11 billion pounds of fish and shellfish last year, with a
wholesale value of $3.6 billion, an increase of 1.8 billion pounds
and $500 million from 1986.
   Imports were valued at a record $8.8 billion in 1987, led by
$1.7 billion worth of fresh and frozen shrimp. Lobster and tuna
were next at $600 million and $500 million, respectively.
   ``Catfish farming, the large aquaculture industry, produced over
372 million pounds of products in 1987,'' the report said. ``Prices
paid to farmers for catfish rose from 60 cents per pound in
September 1987 to a record 80 cents this summer due to tight
supplies.''
   Most of the catfish farms are located in the South, with
Mississippi the largest producer.
   ``Salmon production based in Washington, Oregon, California and
Maine, and trout production centered in Idaho are the second and
third largest aquacultural food fish industries,'' the report said.
   Crawfish production, mostly in Louisiana, was estimated at 95
million pounds in 1987, making it the largest aquacultural
shellfish industry in the United States.

   The Agriculture Department says hog producers
and importers have approved a program of mandatory assessments on
themselves to promote pork and help boost the image of the swine
industry.
   Assistant Secretary Kenneth A. Gilles said Tuesday that 33,534
or 77 percent of the 43,532 valid ballots cast were in favor of the
checkoff plan. Only a simple majority was needed for approval.
   The department conducted the referendum Sept. 7-8 at county
offices.
   Gilles said that since a majority supported the program, the
National Pork Board, which administers the program, will continue
to collect the assessments of one quarter of 1 percent of the
market value of all hogs and pigs sold in the United States and an
equivalent amount on ``all imported porcine animals, pork and pork
products.''
   The USDA issued its order setting up the program on Sept. 5,
1986, and assessments began on Nov. 1, 1986. But the 1985 law
authorizing the program specified a referendum on the checkoff
within 24 months to 30 months.

   No new long-term grain agreement is in sight
yet, but the Agriculture Department says the Soviet Union continues
to buy U.S. corn.
   Sales of an additional 550,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery during the coming year were announced on Tuesday.
   The sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets in the last
four weeks for delivery in the 1988-89 year that started Sept. 1 to
more than 3.5 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 550,000 tons of
corn would be about 21.7 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.61 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $57 million.
   A five-year long-term grain agreement with the Soviet Union will
expire Sept. 30 and negotiators are trying to work out a new one,
or at least an extension of the current agreement, to take effect
on Oct. 1.
   But officials say the details of a new pact probably won't be
worked out before the present agreement expires. However, the
absence of a new agreement does not prevent further sales to the
Soviet Union.
   According to the current agreement, the annual purchases are
supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   Prior to sales announced since Sept. 1, the Soviet Union had
purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn
for delivery in the fifth year of the agreement, plus 830,000 tons
of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

   Sixteen police academy cadets who were
hospitalized, including one who required a liver transplant, were
not denied water or abused, school officials said. But the state's
top law official said the incident would be investigated further.
   ``In the last 10 years we've trained 9,800 cadets,'' Gary F.
Egan, executive director of the Massachusetts Justice Training
Council, said Tuesday. ``I don't know what went wrong.''
   The police cadets were treated at hospitals beginning Sept. 19,
the first day of classes, for ailments ranging from exhaustion and
dehydration to kidney failure. A trainee who quit after the first
day charged that access to water was limited.
   At a Boston news conference today, state Attorney General James
Shannon said his department was conducting the only probe into what
happened at the training center, and described Egan's conclusions
as ``his opinion based on a very preliminary, cursory
investigation. It's certainly not the final word.''
   The academy, located in Agawam just south of Springfield,
reopened today for academic classwork only after being shut for a
week. Physical training has been suspended indefinitely.
   Egan said cadets had access to water during training and that
activity on the first day was no more strenous than any other
group's first day at the western Massachusetts academy.
   ``There was strenuous physical activities, as there always was
on that first day ... (but) we have found no one to date that was
denied water upon request,'' he told a news conference at council
headquarters in this Boston suburb.
   The most seriously ill cadet, Timothy Shepard, a 25-year-old
Pittsfield police trainee, collapsed from heat stroke while running
on the academy track and has been in a coma for a week.
   He received a liver transplant early Tuesday at
Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh and remained in
critical condition today. A spokesman for family members said that
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis had telephoned them, but relatives had
asked that no details of the call be given out.
   George F. Grady, the state's chief epidemiologist, said the
cadets who became ill suffered from dehydration and exhaustion. He
said 50 cadets who were tested showed slight to mild signs of
kidney damage, which can result from dehydration.
   Lawmakers and law enforcement officials said they would
investigate training at Massachusetts' 12 police academies and
conduct hearings on procedures.
   Shannon said that his department's chief civilian investigator,
a former FBI special agent, has been appointed to head an
investigation. ``No one should make premature judgments. There are
many unanswered questions,'' the attorney general said.
   The training council's chairman, Winchester Police Chief John P.
McHugh, apologized to the stricken cadets. However, several police
chiefs in the western part of the state called upon the academy to
reassign two state troopers who were leading the class that was
stricken.
   Grady said it was believed the cadets became ill because they
drank about one-third of the water they needed for the exercise
they were doing.
   Asked if the cadets were at fault for not drinking enough water,
Egan replied, ``Some of them were unaware of the fact that they
were doing damage to themselves. They had a chance to go home every
night to rehydrate.''
   Several stricken cadets told reporters they could not comment on
their experiences at the academy without permission from
supervisors there.
   The cadet who quit after the first day, Mike Purcell of
Northampton, said the routine was severe and that trainees were
allowed only two small cups of water before Shepard collapsed.
   ``I've been through basic training in the Army and it was twice
as bad as that,'' he said. ``The doctors told me that if I had gone
back for a second day, I could have suffered permanent kidney
damage.''
   A spokesman at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield said
Shepard also suffered kidney problems and several of the other
cadets received kidney dialysis. Six remained hospitalized.

   Michael Dukakis hit hard today at conduct in the Reagan
administration, saying George Bush's former colleagues include
dozens ``who broke the law and violated the public trust.'' Bush
defended his tax-deferred savings plan that stirred criticism and
little support when he unveiled it a day earlier.
   Dukakis, in Greensburg, Pa., said that as president he would
sign an executive order barring former top members of his
administration from lobbying the government as long as he was in
office.
   ``High government office is a public trust, not a training camp
for foreign lobbyists or a vehicle for private gain,'' he said at a
rally.
   ``George Bush may be satisfied with this administration's `Hall
of Shame' _ dozens of top administration officials who broke the
law and violated the public trust. He may be satisfied with letting
Japan make the cars while his former colleagues make the license
plates. I say America can do better than that,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor said he would close a ``Deaver
loophole'' under which he said the Reagan administration divided up
the executive office of the president to allow someone leaving the
White House staff to immediately lobby other offices within the
executive office.
   Former White House aide Michael Deaver was found guilty of lying
when he said he couldn't remember contacting former administration
officials on behalf of corporations paying him big fees.
   Bush, meanwhile, setting out on a bus tour through Illinois,
defended his proposal for a tax-deferred savings plan while saying
a college loan program advanced by Dukakis would ``put the IRS on
your tail for the rest of your life.''
   Although Dukakis has scorned Bush's new plan for tax-deferred
savings, saying it would save Americans no more than $20 a year,
Bush said his day-old proposal would ``give taxpayers a little nest
egg.''
   He slashed at Dukakis' plan for college loans that would be paid
back according to an individual's future earnings through tax
withdrawals.
   ``He wants to spend more and I want to put more money in the
hands of individuals, not in the hands of government,'' Bush said.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen also hit
hard at Bush and running mate Dan Quayle today in Harry Truman's
hometown of Independence, Mo.
   Bentsen ridiculed Bush's contention that Dukakis is out of the
political mainstream, saying it is Bush's running mate, Quayle, who
is an arch-conservative with views in line with Sens. Jesse Helms
and Gordon Humphrey.
   As for the prospect of a Quayle presidency if the Republicans
win in November, he said, ``I'll tell you, if they were elected,
I'd pray for the good health of George Bush every night.''
   The vice president, campaigning in the Midwest on Tuesday,
introduced his ``individual savings account'' plan as an
opportunity for low- and middle-income savers to put away up to
$1,000 a year and defer paying taxes on the interest.
   Bush said the system would help Americans be ``better able to
afford a home, pay for college, or start a business.''
   But Dukakis, calculating that the plan would provide a mere $20
a year to the taxpayer, questioned whether his GOP opponent was
offering a serious solution to the economic crunch facing the
middle class.
   ``Twenty bucks a year _ that's Mr. Bush's solution for average
Americans,'' Dukakis told an audience in the Chicago suburb of
Melrose Park. ``He says it will make them, and here I'm quoting,
`better able to afford a home, pay for college, start a business.'
Twenty bucks a year, who's he kidding?''
   Bush's running mate, Dan Quayle, was spending his second
consecutive day in Texas with campaign appearances in El Paso,
Amarilo and Dallas. The Republican vice presidential nominee was
expected to be the focus of Lloyd Bentsen's speech today in
Independence, Mo., where the Democrat was planning to discuss
qualifications for the vice presidency.
   In the latest public opinion poll, 42 percent of 416 likely
voters surveyed said Sunday's debate between Bush and Dukakis was a
tie or didn't know who won _ more than double the 20 percent who
expressed one of those views after the debate.
   The ABC News poll, which included voters who had not seen the
debate but had heard or read about it, indicated the other
post-debate polls and news media accounts reinforced perceptions
that the debate was a dead heat.
   The poll was conducted Monday night and had a margin of error of
plus or minus six percentage points.
   On Tuesday, at an appearance in Columbus, Ohio, Bush introduced
his plan to allow small savers to defer paying taxes on interest
income on savings of up to $1,000 a year as long as the money is
kept in such accounts for five or more years.
   The GOP nominee touted the plan as a way to provide additional
money for home purchases and college educations, but Bush aides
suggested later that the proposal was less far-reaching.
   The campaign said the plan, which would be available to those
with adjusted gross incomes up to $50,000, would only yield about
$14 a year in tax savings for the maximum deposit.
   Campaigning in Illinois, Dukakis suggested that Bush's main
concern is cutting the capital gains tax from its present maximum
of 33 percent to 15 percent _ a benefit for the nation's wealthy.

   Since Emperor Hirohito fell seriously ill, Japanese
have been buying more Rising Sun flags and books about the
87-year-old monarch.
   ``We sold 50 (flags) the day after the emperor vomited blood,''
said a saleswoman for Odakyu, a major Tokyo department store. ``In
addition to individual customers, some companies have ordered
almost 50 flags for their employees, but now we're out of stock.''
   Odakyu has sold more than 100 Rising Sun flags during the past
week, the saleswoman said on condition of anonymity.
   The Mikami Flag Store, a flag wholesaler in Tokyo, said it has
sold three times as many Japanese flags to retailers since Hirohito
vomited blood Sept. 17.
   ``Our clients used to order flags only on special occasions like
(for the) New Year's ceremony, but orders have dramatically
increased since about 10 days ago,'' said Haruhiko Mikami, an
executive with the store.
   Mitsukoshi Department store in Osaka has sold about 15 flags
daily for the last few days, a saleswoman said.
   ``Most of the customers are middle-aged, and some asked how to
set (the flags) at half-staff,'' she said.
   At the Asahiya bookstore's branch in the Ginza area of Tokyo,
sales of books on the emperor began picking up after the emperor's
illness was reported, a spokesman said.
   ``Pro-emperor books sell well, but criticism of the emperor
system or himself don't attract readers,'' he said, also speaking
anonymously.
   A Tokyo company rented about 30 sets of the thin, quilt-like
futon on which many Japanese sleep to a national newspaper and has
received inquiries from police stations in recent days, said the
store owner, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the newspaper, which he did not identify by name, rented
the futons in case it had to keep employees overnight to work on
the emperor story.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, heavily guarded during a surprise visit to Northern
Ireland, said Wednesday that Britain is more determined than ever
to defeat terrorism.
   ``I feel strongly that terrorism must never, never win,'' she
told a group of police officers and widows of murdered members of
the force in east Belfast. ``If it did that would spell the end of
democracy.''
   Mrs. Thatcher stayed away from Roman Catholic strongholds, but
Protestant demonstrators in Lisburn yelled ``Traitor, Traitor,
Traitor'' and ``Go Back To England'' as she made her way through
the streets where six soldiers were blown up by an Irish Republican
Army bomb in June.
   The demonstrators oppose the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement giving
the Irish Republic a voice in Northern Ireland's administrative
affairs. Some Protestants see the accord as a betrayal by the
British and the first step toward a Catholic-dominated united
Ireland.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who escaped an IRA assassination attempt at a
1984 conference of her governing Conservative Party, told the
police officers she heard people suggest that more IRA attacks
would make the public weary.
   ``You don't know the spirit of Northern Ireland or the spirit of
the United Kingdom,'' she said. ``The more difficult things are,
the greater our resolve, determination and courage to defeat that
terrorism which is a cancer in our midst.''
   The IRA is fighting to oust Britain from Protestant-dominated
Northern Ireland and unite the province with the Roman Catholic
Irish Republic under a socialist government.
   This year, it has stepped up its attacks on British soldiers,
killing 27 in Northern Ireland, mainland Britain and continental
Europe. Leaders of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, have
said one aim of targeting the soldiers is to create public
opposition to a continued British presence in the province.
   Security forces mounted a huge security operation for Mrs.
Thatcher's visit, her second to Northern Ireland in less than a
year. Last November, she attended a memorial service in Enniskillen
for 11 people killed when the IRA bombed a ceremony for Britain's
war dead.
   No advance information on her itinerary was released for
security reasons.
   Sinn Fein publicity director Danny Morrison said the secrecy and
intense security ``shows how vulnerable she feels and just how
tenuous is British rule here.''
   Mrs. Thatcher told the police officers that she was grateful for
the sacrifices of their colleagues and their continued efforts to
maintain freedom and democracy. Among the audience was policewoman
Alison Johnston, 26, who lost an eye in an IRA bombing in County
Fermanagh on Aug. 18.
   ``When we have got rid of terrorism, and we must get rid of
terrorism, this is a marvelous country, a country which can be very
prosperous, if again you can get the security that the rest of us
in the United Kingdom take for granted,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher also visited several thriving factories and
businesses during her day-long tour. John Hume, leader of the
moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party, said he hoped
her visit would help create new jobs.

   The Connecticut Board of Parole today
denied early release for the man convicted in the 1979
strangulation of a 14-year-old Stamford girl after an emotional
plea from the victim's father.
   ``It is an insult to our daughter's memory that he could even be
considered eligible for parole in less than nine years,'' Charlie
Hoyt told the parole board during a brief hearing today at Somers
State Prison.
   Bruce D. Williams Jr. pleaded guilty to first-degree
manslaughter under a 1980 plea bargain agreement. A rape charge was
dropped under the agreement. He was sentenced to 20 years to life
in the death of Hoyt's daughter Sandy, who was lured to Williams'
Stamford home with the promise of her first baby-sitting assignment.
   Last week, Hoyt presented the board's chairman, Richard
Reddington, with more than 23,500 petition signatures urging that
Williams be denied parole.
   Williams, 35, appeared briefly before the board today, asking
the three-member panel to review his prison record and his efforts
to obtain a college degree while in prison. He did not mention the
girl's death.
   While addressing to the board, Hoyt broke down and had
difficulty getting through his statement.
   ``If there are any doubts in your minds about this monster, then
I suggest that the board take some time and view his videotaped
confession,'' Hoyt said.
   It took the board members only 10 minutes in executive session
to decide to deny Williams' bid for release. When they emerged,
Reddington told Williams that because of the ``extreme
seriousness'' of his offense, his request was being denied.
   The board scheduled another hearing for September 1994 with next
potentional rlease date of Jan. 12, 1995.
   ``I'll be there,'' Hoyt said.
   In 1983, Hoyt's lobbying helped prompt legislators to enact a
law that allows victims of most serious felonies to testify at an
inmate's parole hearing.
   Hoyt began his petition drive aimed at keeping Williams behind
bars hoping to collect 10,000 signatures, but ended up with more
than twice that.
   ``People want to do something about the system,'' he said last
week.
   Hoyt, who now lives in Fairield, says Williams called Sandy and
said he was a doctor and needed someone to watch his child while he
went on an emergency call.
   He took her to his house. Though Williams' young child was in
the house, he tied Sandy to a bed, raped her and then strangled
her, Hoyt said.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres today
dismissed the view held by some senior U.S. and Egyptian officials
that the Palestine Liberation Organization was undergoing an
evolution toward acceptance of the Jewish state.
   ``They continue their acts of terror to this very day in spite
of hints to the contrary,'' Peres said after a meeting with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   A change in PLO policy toward Israel could remove a major
roadblock to Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid told President
Reagan during a meeting on Monday that senior PLO leaders had come
around to the view that Israel had a right to exist and were trying
to persuade other elements of Yasser Arafat's organization to go
along.
   This view is shared by senior State Department officials, who
detected signs of moderation in a recent speech by chairman Arafat.
   But Peres, who participated in the meeting with Reagan and
Meguid, said he did not understand ``when people say there are
moderate people'' in the PLO.
   ``I know only about moderate decisions because we are not
dealing with the psychology of people,'' Peres said. ``We are
dealing with the nature of the situation.''
   Peres said he discussed with Shultz steps that might be taken to
promote peace talks in the remaining four months of the Reagan
administration. Shultz has warned against a continuing ``vacuum''
in the region.
   But there was no indication that a way had been found to break
the stalemate.
   Peres said there were ``some sweet, sweet definitions'' in
Arafat's speech in Strasbourg, France, but it lacked ``any
realistic suggestions.''

   Lloyd Bentsen, in a symbolic trip to
Harry Truman's hometown, said Wednesday he was ``ready to lead
America'' if tragedy befell the president and he questioned whether
his Republican counterpart could rightly say the same.
   Bentsen, stepping out of Michael Dukakis' shadow to deliver his
assessment of the vice presidency, did not mention either George
Bush or Dan Quayle in his speech. But he made it clear he
questioned Bush's judgment as well as Quayle's qualifications to be
``a heartbeat away from the nation's highest office.''
   ``Like Harry Truman, I think I'm ready,'' the Texas senator told
students at a high school named after the former president,
recalling Truman's elevation from vice president in 1945 when
Franklin Roosevelt died. ``Ready to run and serve with Mike
Dukakis. Ready to help him lead America to a new era of greatness.
... And, if tragedy should ever strike the president of the United
States, I think I'm ready to lead America,'' Bentsen said.
   At a news conference after the speech, Democrat Bentsen meade it
clear he did not view his colleague from Indiana as being up to
that task.
   ``I'll tell you, if they were elected, I'd pray for the good
health of George Bush every night,'' Bentsen said.
   Polls have shown voter uncertainty over the 41-year-old Quayle
and, after weeks of trying to make Quayle a major campaign issue,
the Dukakis campaign decided to dedicate an entire Bentsen event to
a discussion of the vice presidency.
   Bush and Quayle have tried to portray Dukakis as a liberal far
to the left of the American mainstream, but Bentsen tried to turn
the issue around, saying Quayle is an arch-conservative ``much more
in tune with ... Jesse Helms and Gordon Humphrey than he is with
George Bush.''
   Asked if Bush was in the mainstream, Bentsen characterized the
vice president as someone who has repeatedly flip-flopped on
important issues.
   ``I'd have to look at Vice President Bush's latest positions on
the issues to be sure of that,'' Bentsen told reporters.
   And he criticized Bush for selecting Quayle, saying even
Republican senators were shocked by the choice.
   In his speech, Bentsen recalled hearing of Roosevelt's death
while flying back from a World War II bombing mission, and he also
spoke of meeting President Truman during Bentsen's first term as a
congressman from Texas. Later, Bentsen said, he was given the
Senate office formerly used by Truman.
   ``Somehow, sitting in Harry Truman's office made me feel I had a
lot to live up to in Washignton,'' Bentsen said.
   After listing his experience as a representative, businessman
and senator who rose to chairman of the Finance Committee, Bentsen
took an oblique swipe at Bush and the relatively unknown Quayle.
   ``I think anyone who runs for vice president must earn the
respect of the American people,'' Bentsen said. ``And he must enjoy
the trust and respect of the president. If a presidential candidate
does not choose a running mate with those qualifications he does
not respect the importance and dignity of the office of the vice
presidency.''
   That office, Bentsen said, should be occupied by a trusted
adviser to the president willing to ``speak out when someone comes
up with the idea of selling arms to the ayatollah in exchange for
hostages.''
   Bentsen, in another salvo at Bush, said the ``vice president
must be more than a back-up chief executive,'' and he praised
Dukakis for selecting a running mate who differs with him on
several issues.
   ``He does not want his vice president to hide behind some lame
excuse by saying `I just wasn't in the loop. I wasn't in the loop
all 17 times that was discussed.''' Bush has used terms such as
``not in the loop'' to say he was not fully informed about the deal
at the center of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Bentsen also used his visit to Truman's hometown to paint
Dukakis as a Democrat in the Truman mold, willing, unlike Bush, to
take responsibility for his actions.

<HEAD>Emperor Receives Another Blood Transfusion, Stength Waning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito received another blood transfusion
Wednesday and more intravenous doses of nutrients, but a newspaper
said the 87-year-old monarch's strength was waning dangerously
after nine days without solid food.
   The 0.43-pint transfusion was Hirohito's eighth in six days and
brought the total since his condition worsened on Sept. 19 to 6.8
pints, more than two-thirds the usual amount of blood in the
emperor's body, news reports said.
   Kyodo News Service reported that a vehicle carrying blood was
seen entering the Imperial Palace Wednesday evening, but the
Imperial Household Agency said there was no immediate plan to give
the world's longest reigning living monarch another transfusion.
   Palace officials said earlier that the emperor had discharged a
small amount of blood, a sign his internal bleeding had not stopped.
   They said his condition was stable and that by evening he was
resting, but after nearly two days of stable readings his
temperature rose to 100 degrees in the afternoon. By evening it
eased to 98.9 degrees, still above his normal temperature of 95.9
degrees.
   Chief palace physician Akira Takagi said the large transfusions
apparently did not harm Hirohito's heart or kidney functions, so
doctors planned to continue them to compensate for blood lost in
internal bleeding.
   But news reports quoted several private physicians as saying the
emperor's condition remains unpredictable due to lack of nutrition
and high levels of bile, causing jaundice.
   The doctors have said they believe the emperor's swollen
pancreas may have interferred with the flow of bile, possibly
contributing to a festering internal infection also linked to the
internal bleeding.
   In its evening edition, the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest
newspaper, quoted sources close to the court doctors as saying that
``the intravenous feeding has clearly left the emperor without
enough nutrition, and the weakening of his overall condition is
causing concern.''
   Hirohito has had no solid food in nine days. He has been in
serious condition since he vomited blood on Sept. 19. On Saturday,
his temperature reached 102.6 degrees, but doctors were able to
bring his fever down with antibiotics.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports
that the emperor has cancer and have urged the media to refrain
from such speculation because it might dishearten the emperor, who
they say is conscious and has been watching television.
   Imperial Household Agency officials said that as of Wednesday,
about 647,000 people had signed their names to registries set up at
the palace and at 11 other agency-related facilities around the
country to wish for the emperor's early recovery.
   Another 1.36 million others also signed their names in
registries set up by local governments across Japan, according to
National Police Agency figures.
   Under the Constitution, the emperor has no political power but
signs documents already approved by the government and serves as a
symbol of the unity of Japan.

   The five members of the Nobel prize
committee met behind locked doors Wednesday to choose the winner of
the 1988 peace prize.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev were
mentioned as leading contenders for the prestigious award.
   The committee's regulations bar it from divulging names, but the
Oslo daily VG speculated the superpower leaders would share the
honor for signing a treaty to dismantle intermediate-range nuclear
weapons and putting arms control efforts on a new course.
   Committee Chairman Egil Aarvik was to announce the decision at 2
p.m. (9 a.m. EDT) Thursday.
   The committee made its selection from an initial list of 97
candidates at a two-hour session at the Nobel Institute, a
two-story building in the shadow of the royal palace in downtown
Oslo.
   The list included 74 individuals and 23 organizations.
   Wednesday's session was the group's first formal meeting since
mid-August, but Nobel officials indicated that a consensus emerged
even before the final session.
   The prize carries a cash award of $390,000.
   Aarvik quashed speculation about U.N. Secretary General Javiar
Perez de Cuellar. He said the U.N. chief was not nominated before
the Feb. 1 deadline for this year's prize.
   Among other candidates reportedly on the list were the World
Health Organization, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, U.N.
mediator Diego Cordovez, Anglican church envoy to Lebanon Terry
Waite, the Greenpeace environmentalist group, jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, and Norwegian Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who chaired a U.N. environmental
commission.
   Helge Pharo, a consultant for the committee, said the list of
candidates was whittled down to about six by the summer and was
further narrowed at the last meeting in August.
   Pharo told The Associated Press he and a second consultant
prepared reports and profiles of the candidates that sometimes ran
up to 20 pages long.
   The decision is by consensus, and the committee members do not
vote, he said.
   Last year's peace laureate was President Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica for his Central American peace plan.
   The peace prize is the first to be announced of five awards
founded by the estate of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite who
died in 1896. A sixth prize in economics was added in 1968 and
funded by the Bank of Sweden.
   The prizes for medicine, physics and chemistry will be announced
in mid-October in Stockholm. No date has been set for the
literature prize announcement, also in the Swedish capital.
   Nobel's testament dictated that the peace prize be awarded by a
committee elected by the Norwegian Parliament, but his reasoning
remains a mystery. Norway and Sweden were under one monarchy until
1905.
   The will said the prize should go to the person who has worked
most ``for fraternity between peoples, for the abolition or
reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of
peace congresses.''
   But the committee has expanded the definition to encompass human
rights activists such as U.S. author Elie Wiesel in 1986, Polish
union leader Lech Walesa in 1983, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov
in 1975 and U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King in 1964.
   In addition to Aarvik, a retired journalist and former Cabinet
minister, the committee members are history professor Francis
Sejersted; former Prime Minister Odvar Nordli; Gunnar J. Staalsett,
a priest and head of the Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation;
and author Gidske Anderson.
   Members are elected to six-year terms.

   Sen. Brock Adams says he made an ``error in
judgment'' by allowing a 26-year-old woman to spend the night at
his house last year, but he denies allegations that he sexually
assaulted her.
   ``These charges are absolutely false,'' Adams, D-Wash., told
reporters on Tuesday. ``I have never had a desire to hurt this
woman or her family, and I don't know why they are trying to hurt
me and my family.''
   The woman, Kari Tupper, a former congressional secretary whom
Adams has known since she was a child, has been unavailable for
comment in Washington State, where she now lives with her husband.
   But she has previously given interviews to a reporter from The
Washingtonian, which plans to publish a story in November's
editions. The story will also appear in Friday's editions of a
Seattle newspaper, the magazine said in a statement today.
   The statement said Ms. Tupper told a reporter that Adams began
making sexual advances to her in April 1985.
   She also said that on the night of March 27, 1987, Adams offered
her a glass of wine at his home and bragged about his sexual
conquests. After finishing the wine, the magazine paraphrased her
as saying, her last memory was going to the bathroom.
   ``She awoke the next morning, naked, in bed besides Adams, and
his hands caressing her body,'' the magazine said in the statement.
She claimed she was drugged.
   Adams' spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone call
to discuss the article, which the magazine declined to provide to
The Associated Press.
   But on Tuesday, Adams claimed Tupper ``threatened to file a
civil lawsuit unless I paid $400,000 in hush money ... Betty and I
refused her demands _ I will not be blackmailed.'' Adams' wife,
Betty, was at his side during the press briefing.
   Adams, 61, a former transportation secretary in the Carter
administration, said he should never have invited Tupper to spend
the night at his house on March 27 when Mrs. Adams was not around.
   ``I made an error in judgment that put me in a position where I
could be falsely accused,'' he said. ``For that I apologize to my
family, friends and the people of the state of Washington.''
   Tupper was an $18,000-a-year secretary with the House Select
Committee on Aging at the time. She filed a report with the
Metropolitan Police Department on July 24, 1987, alleging that
Adams had ``fondled her breasts and buttocks.'' Adams was not
identified by name in the complaint.
   She alleged that the incident took place in Adams' house in an
exclusive residential section nearly four months earlier _ between
9:15 p.m. on March 27 and 6:30 a.m. on March 28 _ according to the
report.
   Capt. William White III of the District of Columbia police said
the allegation of simple assault was investigated. ``We consider
the matter closed,'' White told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
which first reported the story. The U.S. attorney's office reviewed
the case but did not press charges.
   In a two-page statement, Adams gave the following account of the
events on March 27. He refused to answer any questions.
   Adams said Tupper had asked to meet him March 27, 1987, at a
swank Italian restaurant in Georgetown to discuss her job
situation. At the request of Tupper's family, Adams had helped
Tupper secure a position on Capitol Hill after his election in 1986.
   Adams said he called her office that day to confirm the dinner
date, but was told she was ill. Assuming the meeting was off, Adams
went home to play tennis with three friends.
   Later that night, Tupper, upset that Adams had not showed up at
the restaurant, called him at his home to ask if she could drop by,
Adams said. She had visited the house in the past and had stored
belongings in the basement.
   After she arrived, the pair went to a neighborhood restaurant
but it was closed. Neither was feeling very well, Adams said, so
the pair returned to his home to get her car.
   Once there, the woman came back into the house. ``At this point
I told her I was exhausted and was going to sleep,'' Adams said.
   ``I told her that she was welcome to stay at the house if she
was not well enough to drive home. She said she preferred to stay
and then I went to bed, alone. I did not sexually assault the woman.
   ``Looking back, I should have called her a cab, but at the time,
the suggestion seemed appropriate for a family friend who was upset
about her job and not feeling well,'' Adams said.

<HEAD>Opposition Group Accuses Government Of Killing Nearly 1,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The main opposition group accused the
military government Wednesday of killing nearly 1,000 people since
a Sept. 18 coup, and it registered as a political party to
challenge 26 years of authoritarian rule.
   A second pro-democracy group, made up of followers of former
Prime Minister U Nu, also registered Wednesday, and a third
opposition political party announced its formation.
   Some Burmese said soldiers were sealing off urban centers to
prevent people from fleeing to rebel-controlled areas to carry on
the fight for democracy.
   Several hundred students have fled to the Thai-Burmese border,
where large areas are controlled by the Karen, Mon, Shan and other
minority groups. The students are seeking military training from
the Karens, perhaps the most powerful of the rebel groups.
   ``There are tens of thousands of students and monks who want to
leave the cities but cannot,'' said Ko Ko, a 35-year-old teacher
from Rangoon who arrived Tuesday at a Karen camp next to the Thai
border.
   Soe Hlaing, a 36-year-old lawyer from Pegu, said he saw nine
people executed by soldiers on a bridge in the town of Tharrawdy
during his flight to the Karen-controlled areas.
   ``Each was shot with a gun. One bullet to the heart,'' Soe
Hlaing said.
   The key opposition alliance, the National League for Democracy,
said it had not decided whether to participate in elections
promised by the government. Under Burmese law, it had to register
with the government to take part in the vote.
   League spokesman Win Htein said the government must create a
``democratic situation'' by ending random arrests and allowing free
speech and press before the league can contemplate participation in
elections.
   Win Htein accused the military government of killing nearly
1,000 people since Sept. 18 but said he had no proof of summary
executions of anti-government leaders. The government says about
350 people have been killed.
   Win Htein said the league did not encourage the flight to rebel
areas. Some Western analysts said they believed the rush to rebel
areas would have little effect on the struggle between the military
government and opposition forces.
   ``They will rot in the jungles,'' said one Western diplomat in
Bangkok. ``They may kill a few Burmese soldiers, but the great
strength of the pro-democracy side was the mass, peaceful
demonstrations and strikes in Rangoon. And those appear to be
over.''
   Win Htein said the league has started to send teams from Rangoon
to organize grass-roots opposition to the military-backed political
apparatus that has rule Burma for 26 years.
   Retired brigadier general Aung Gyi was named league chairman on
Tuesday. Two other key pro-democracy leaders _ former Defense
Minister Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burma's main
revolutionary martyr _ are top officers in the alliance.
   ``We have already sent some people to the countryside,'' said
Win Htein in a telephone interview.
   The alliance has an uphill battle to challenge the National
Unity Party, the new name for the ruling Burma Socialist Program
Party.
   Western analysts say Gen. Saw Maung, who seized power in the
Sept. 18 coup, is unquestionably behind the National Unity Party.
He ordered troops to gun down anti-government demonstrators who for
weeks filled Rangoon's streets in protest marches.
   Saw Maung has called for multiparty general elections but has
set no date.
   The government decreed Tuesday that rebels, foreign-aided
groups, the military, civil servants and ``organizations which
misuse religion'' will not be allowed to form political parties.
   The other opposition group to register with the government was
The Democracy Party. The formation of the National Democratic Party
also was announced, but it did not register with the government.

   Communist East Berlin is giving a flashy welcome
to about 500 capitalists attending finance talks on the other side
of the Berlin Wall, and a Japanese banker said Wednesday he is
impressed with Marxist hospitality.
   ``The (East German) border soldiers even greet me because they
recognize me now,'' said Takeo Shinde, a spokesman for the Bank of
Tokyo.
   Shinde is among about 500 finance executives from several
countries staying in East Berlin hotels for the World
Bank-International Monetary Fund talks in West Berlin.
   Hotel rooms in West Berlin are booked full because of the
meetings, so many attending the financial talks are staying at the
communist sector's few luxury hotels.
   The new guests are expected to add about $270,000 to East
Germany's coffers, say sources within the country's ruling
Communist Party who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   East Germany, which denounced the debt policies of the
industrialized nations in the past, now has gone all out to please
its special guests. It has arranged tours to the world-famous
Pergamon museum in East Berlin and to the nearby historic city of
Potsdam and let them breeze through normally lengthy border checks.
   Alan F. Delp, a senior vice president of the First National Bank
of Chicago, is among several executives of American banks staying
in East Berlin.
   ``The pleasant surprise has been that it is so easy to go back
and forth. Very honestly, it couldn't be easier,'' he was quoted as
telling the ``Joint Annual Meeting News,'' a special
English-language daily newspaper published by organizers of the
talks.
   Armed East German guards and the strongly fortified Berlin Wall
are not the only barriers that mark a clear distinction between
East and West.
   Western visitors to East Berlin often complain about drab
hotels, and the heavy presence of plainclothes security guards in
the eastern sector.
   But capitalists staying in the communist sector say they feel
right at home in the best communist-owned lodgings.
   ``I feel very comfortable there,'' said Shinde, who was staying
at East Berlin's Metropol Hotel. ``The employees are very
well-trained and very helpful.''
   Jay Newman, senior vice president with Shearson Lehman
International, a financial services firm, called East Berlin's posh
Grand Hotel ``the best hotel in the world.''
   But East Berlin's capitalist guests have not been welcomed by
everyone.
   Unofficial protest groups in East Berlin have denounced the
World Bank-IMF meetings as well as the financiers staying in their
side of the divided city. The meetings end Thursday.
   East German activists had planned a march this week through East
Berlin to protest the World Bank-IMF policies toward the heavily
indebted Third World, but it was banned by a judge.
   About 500 protesters held a peaceful demonstration at an East
Berlin church Sunday and urged that the special guests not be made
to feel at home.
   The protesters handed out leaflets saying, ``Stare at them (the
finance executives), and let them know they are not wanted.''
   The IMF has fashioned rescue packages to help financially
troubled Third World countries. The World Bank provides those
countries with aid to help develop their economies.

<HEAD>Reagan Accepts Resignation of Budget Director Miller</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan announced today that he had
accepted the resignation of his director of the Office of
Management and Budget, James C. Miller III.
   The president said he would appoint the deputy director of the
agency, Joe Wright, as the next director. The agency acts as the
president's budget-writing office.
   Miller, who took over from OMB Director David Stockman in
October 1985, has said for some time that he planned to leave
before the end of the administration.
   Wright has held the deputy slot since 1982.
   Reagan said Miller planned to become a fellow at the ``Center
for Public Choice'' at George Mason University in Virginia.
   Reagan made the announcement prior to a speech on the
congressional appropriations process in the Old Executive Office
Building.
   The president hailed Miller for his service at the agency, as
well as for his work as the head of the Federal Trade Commission.
   ``He played a leading role in removing the shackles of excessive
regulation from our economy,'' Reagan said.
   ``Since becoming the director of OMB he has been at the center
of our battle to bring the deficit down. And it's been coming down
almost from the day he took over,'' Reagan said.

   NASA today cleared Discovery for
flight, giving the go-ahead for a launch at 9:59 a.m. EDT Thursday.
``It's been a long 2{ years,'' the space shuttle administrator said
as NASA workers prepared for the first U.S. manned mission since
the Challenger tragedy.
   Richard Truly briefed five anxious astronauts just minutes after
the space agency's new launch directorate completed a pre-flight
review. Truly described the crew as ``elated to be heading for
space.''
   Anticipation and tension rose across the NASA system as final
preparations accelerated. ``Even the weather is looking good,''
Truly said. ``The space shuttle is ready to fly,''
   ``Right now, we see no constraints,'' NASA test director Frank
Merlino said as the space agency said one nagging technical problem
had been resolved. ``We're looking forward to a good countdown and
a safe launch.''
   Robert Crippen, the veteran astronaut who has one-man authority
to approve or veto the long-awaited launch effort, supervised the
meeting of NASA launch officials. The group gave its approval for
shuttle fueling beginning late Wednesday night.
   An equipment flaw that threatened to delay the launch was
resolved by engineers who worked through the night. Industry
contractors reported to Crippen today that the problem, involving a
damaged O-ring on a rocket being prepared for a future shuttle
flight, should have no impact on the Discovery mission.
   A statement said the problem had been reviewed by all levels of
NASA management and that a similar rocket on Discovery had been
cleared for flight.
   Truly said, ``The payload is ready to fly.'' The payload is a
gigantic data-relay satellite, to be launched from the shuttle just
six hours after liftoff.
   ``We have to be successful,'' said Kennedy Space Center's
director, Forrest McCartney, in reflecting on the Discovery launch.
``The nation could not withstand another accident like Challenger.''
   Discovery's crew _ Frederick H. Hauck, Richard O. Covey, George
D. Nelson, John M. Lounge and David C. Hilmers _ planned a
leisurely day today, receiving briefings on launch preparations and
visiting with their wives at crew quarters seven miles from the
launch pad, 39B.
   The technical question arose not with Discovery itself, but with
a small satellite booster rocket being readied for a shuttle flight
next February. Scientists want to be certain a tiny cut found on
one of its O-ring seals does not exist on a twin rocket whose
launch is Discovery's main item of business.
   The cut apparently was inflicted during installation and does
not represent a design or manufacturing defect. To be certain, they
worked overnight checking documentation and pressure-testing
deliberately flawed rings.
   Launch for the four-day flight is set for 9:59 a.m., with a
2{-hour window that allows for weather or technical delays.
   NASA officials said they'd done everything possible to make the
mission safe.
   ``You can't totally take the risk out of something like this,''
McCartney said in an interview. ``But in those last hours of the
count I'll know that we have done everything we know how to make
this a safe flight, that we have reduced the risks as much as we
possibly can.''
   Asked what would be going through his mind as the count ticks
down, the center's deputy director, Tom Utsman, said, ``I'll be
saying that hopefully we have done all the right things, that we
haven't taken any shortcuts, that we haven't overlooked anything.
I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't nervous. But I also am confident.''
   Though Thursday's forecast called for generally clear skies,
with widely scattered showers, Crippen said Tuesday that the
biggest threat could come from surface winds prevalent here this
time of the year.
   He said liftoff would be delayed if winds exceeded 19 mph from
the south because they would cause stress on Discovery's aft skirt.
A crosswind greater than 14 mph also would not be acceptable at the
shuttle runway here in case the astronauts had to make an emergency
landing.
   Crippen's launch directorate, made up of 21 National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and contractor engineers and managers, was
created to overcome management problems that contributed to the
Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion that killed the seven crew
members.
   Crippen said the team's initial meeting Tuesday, which lasted
several hours, provided an ``excellent review'' that revealed no
problems such as the ones that never were aired before top launch
officials prior to the Challenger disaster.
   The nicked O-ring is used as a pressure seal in an inertial
upper stage rocket needed to boost a communications satellite to a
higher orbit after it has been released by the astronauts from the
cargo bay. It is not the same type of O-ring that failed and caused
the Challenger explosion.
   The $100 million satellite and its rocket already had been
tested and approved for flight aboard Discovery when the problem
was discovered Monday on similar hardware being readied for the
February launch.

<TEXT>
   Steve Nesbitt hopes a successful
launch for Discovery will bring his career as NASA commentator
``full circle'' and help erase the awful memory of being at the
microphone when Challenger blew up and left him searching for the
right words.
   ``I knew I had tremendous pressure to say something,
obviously,'' he recalled recently. ``I just felt this compelling
need to keep talking except there was no information.''
   Nesbitt sat in Mission Control on Jan. 28, 1986, preparing to
take over the commentary from Kennedy Space Center as soon as
Challenger cleared the launch tower. He was listening to flight
controllers, reading off altitude and velocity numbers _ and only
occasionally glancing at the television screen that showed the
ascending shuttle.
   Suddenly he heard the flight surgeon exclaim, ``What was that?''
   ``I knew instantly this was terribly wrong. But I had not seen
the initial part of it. All I saw was this white cloud and two
(solid rocket boosters) SRBs.
   ``But I didn't see a shuttle.''
   Nesbitt said he didn't want to speculate about the fate of the
astronauts and the orbiter at that instant.
   ``I just had this belated look at the television screen, which
is about like looking through a pipe _ you don't see the whole sky.
And you're asking yourself if there is an orbiter there ditching
into the ocean, or did it somehow come free and is flying back. You
can't immediately go announce to the world that everybody has been
killed when you don't know that.''
   The three short sentences Nesbitt ad-libbed were replayed
endlessly by the nation's TV and radio networks: ``Flight
controllers are looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously
a major malfunction. We have no downlink.''
   To many, those words were a bewildering understatement. Nesbitt
is still asked about them, even at parties: ``Why did you say that?
Why didn't you say it exploded?''
   In hindsight, he said, he doesn't think he could have done
anything different.
   Nesbitt, 37, has received a promotion at JSC _ from public
affairs specialist to deputy director of the media services branch
_ and Discovery may be his last flight as a commentator.
   ``I requested to be able to do this launch,'' he said. ``It
would give me a feeling of having come full circle. Not ending my
career as a commentator on that mission (Challenger) would really
mean a lot to me. You don't want to leave after a failure. You want
to quit while you're successful.''
   He's certain he'll be tense Thursday morning, pacing and
drinking lots of coffee during the couple of hours before his job
begins.
   ``I'm always nervous for launches, but I think I'll be even more
so for this one,'' he said. ``Not only because I know of the things
that can happen _ having seen it all _ but just knowing that so
many people are going to be watching and it's all under a
microscope. I better not make any mistakes.''

   You know something important and
dangerous is unfolding here at the Kennedy Space Center because the
NASA people are so nervous, the industry representatives are so
subdued and the tools of technology are so awesome.
   Not space technology. Broadcast technology.
   They are all here: Skylink 11, Starcam 8, Mundo Latino, Skycom
7, Live Star 5, American Uplink Inc., Satel-Link 4, STAR 9 and, of
course, Space Link 13. To say nothing of Eyewitness News 10 Newsat
and a host of Newstars too numerous to mention. Fifty-five
satellite uplinks in all.
   Not to be outdone by the local TV set-ups, someone at ABC
stenciled the words ``Jennings,'' and ``Gibson,'' on a news trailer
door, presumably so the anchors wouldn't get lost among the sea of
network news facilities. Later, the stencil was changed to an
incrementally less pretentious, ``Anchors Office.''
   On Wednesday, NASA approved Discovery for flight.
   There is much to be nervous, subdued and awesome about:
Thursday's scheduled launch is probably the most important American
space milestone since Neil Armstrong planted his one small step on
the moon.
   In the 19 years since, the United States returned to the moon
five times, developed the Skylab space station, conducted a
remarkable joint mission with Soviet cosmonauts and invented a
space shuttle fleet that made 24 successful flights in less than
five years.
   Some of those missions were exciting and all of them important,
but none was so perilous to the American manned space program as
the one scheduled to start at midmorning Thursday. The Challenger
accident in 1986, with schoolchildren watching all across the
world, cast an exceptional pall over the space program and many
believe the shuttle program could not survive a catastrophe to
Discovery or its five-man crew.
   ``It's got to work,'' says Rick Hauck, Discovery's blunt-spoken
commander. ``We clearly cannot afford to lose another vehicle, much
less another crew. I don't think the manned spaceflight program
could withstand another Challenger.''
   No one expects another explosion, but people are spooked by the
eerie string of post-Challenger accidents that doomed a Titan, a
Delta and an Atlas-Centaur, the previously reliable workhorses of
America's unmanned rocket fleet.
   With the past three years so bizarre and unfortunate, no wonder
the buttonmakers have dubbed this flight, ``Back to Future.''
   The nervousness among the NASA people is easy to sense here at
the launch site. Space workers will not soon take for granted that
in a do-or-die business, the good guys always do. Yet aside from
the danger to man and machine, there is an almost palpable threat
to the nation's spirit of adventure and challenge. Notwithstanding
an assurance from one top NASA official that the program would go
on, no matter what, 16,000 people work at Kennedy Space Center and
practically every one of them believes that Hauck is right _ the
loss of Discovery would ground the shuttle program again, probably
forever.
   Industry is subdued in part because NASA has set an all-business
tone to its back-to-spaceflight mission, and in part because a
Utah-based rocketry company named Morton Thiokol Inc. was held
largely to blame for the Challenger accident. Thiokol was an
ambitious self-promoter in the do-not-die days of the shuttle
program, at one point making up posters which showed a waving
American flag against the background of a particularily spectacular
shuttle launch.
   ``Way to go America,'' crowed the Thiokol poster.
   It was shocking to learn during the Challenger investigations
that a Thiokol official had been ordered by superiors to ``take off
his engineering hat and put on his management hat,'' an edict that
undermined company engineers who opposed making the cold-weather
launch.
   Thiokol has been paying liability money ever since to the
Challenger astronauts' survivors, and the launch-site demeanor has
changed for all the contractors. There are still souvenirs floating
around the space center, but the industry news center is a work
room again and the company representatives are less boosterish,
more tentative.
   On the wall behind the Thiokol booth hangs a color photograph
depicting the five Discovery astronauts along with a printed
reminder _ perhaps to the people wearing Thiokol management hats:
``The STS-26 Crew is Counting on You!''

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party on Wednesday harshly
criticized undisciplined members and said they were helping to
increase inflation and corruption that threaten economic reform.
   A front-page editorial in the party newspaper, the People's
Daily, accused local party units of seeking ways to profit
illegally from the inflation and short supplies and ignoring orders
from Beijing to cut spending.
   ``Those who don't abide by the party's discipline must be
punished,'' the party warned in its harshest indictment of the role
that officials and party members have played in the growing
economic disorder.
   The editorial probably was approved by the party's top
policy-making Central Committee, which began a closed-door,
five-day session Monday. The committee is expected to approve a
two-year moratorium on price reform and measures to control
inflation and excessive capital construction.
   China's Supreme Court meanwhile ordered lower courts to punish
government officials found guilty of profiteering and speculation.
   ``Those officials have seriously disrupted the normal economic
environment and hampered the smooth progress of China's reform and
construction,'' the court said.
   It ordered an end to fining guilty officials rather than
bringing criminal charges against them.
   Inflation has soared from about 7 percent last year to more than
20 percent this year. Overspending by government offices and
state-run factories and widespread speculation have been major
factors, although issuing too much currency and loose credit also
is to blame.
   Reports appear in the official media almost daily about local
government officials and factory managers, many party members, who
bought goods at state-subsidized prices and resold them on the
black market for huge profits.
   The People's Daily lectured party members to put the collective
good above individual profit. It repeatedly stressed that ``the
individual must submit to the organization'' and lower-level party
organs to higher ones.
   ``We must enforce party discipline to guarantee the benefit of
the whole,'' it said. ``Strict discipline and unanimous action are
good traditions of our party.''
   The editorial did not address recent unconfirmed reports of
divisions in the party's highest ranks over what economic course to
take.
   Some foreign reports suggest that General Secretary Zhao Ziyang,
who a year ago promoted rapid decentralization of the economy, has
been sidelined in economic policy-making because of the high
inflation and a surge of bank withdrawals and panic buying.
   But foreign diplomats believe Zhao is not in serious political
trouble even though his plan for rapid change has been shelved.
   A party work meeting before the Central Committee session
announced that restoring order would be the main task of the next
two years, putting planned price and wage reforms on hold.
   Officials insist they have not abandoned their long-term goal of
modernizing the economy by replacing cumbersome central planning
with market mechanisms.
   But Chinese and foreign economists note that market mechanisms
cannot function properly until artificially low, state-set prices
are allowed to fluctuate with supply and demand.
   The freeze in price reform also means the irrational pricing
that has encouraged black marketeering will continue, hampering the
party's disciplinary drive.

   The decision to relocate half the
journalists from the space shuttle press center by midnight before
launch was condemned as irrational and illogical Wednesday by
reporters assigned to the Discovery liftoff.
   ``The logic escapes me.'' said Kathy Sawyer of the Washington
Post.
   The Air Force, citing safety concerns in the aftermath of the
Challenger disaster, is limiting the number of reporters at NASA's
Complex 39 press site to 1,800. More than 5,000 have applied for
credentials.
   ``I don't understand the difference between having 4,000 here
and 1,800 here,'' said John Wilford of The New York Times. ``It's
just a lousy situation.''
   The Times and the Post, like all newspapers, were being
restricted to two staffers at the press site until an hour after
launch. Sawyer said the limitation would make her work
``logistically much more difficult,'' since facilities at the
remote site are rudimentary.
   Studies conducted by the Air Force in the wake of the Jan. 28,
1986, Challenger accident and a Titan 34D explosion three months
later have raised safety concerns about the press site 4.2 miles
from launch pad 39B.
   Reporters restricted from the main site will view the launch
from a location about 6{ miles from the pad along the NASA Causeway.
   The studies concern the patterns of falling debris from solid
rockets should they malfunction just after launch and have to be
blown up by a signal from the ground.
   Jerry Hannifin, a Time magazine correspondent who has been
covering space launches from the beginning, has protested to the
White House and NASA.
   ``There are far greater dangers from mosquitoes that might be
carrying yellow fever or malaria (at the secondary press site) than
from an exploding SRB (solid rocket booster),'' he said.
   ``We're separated from our mission. It's ominous,'' Hannifin
said. ``I've covered World War II, Korea, Southeast Asia. This is
just part of the business. It's our decision.''
   ``I'm not convinced it's totally a matter of safety. I think the
military would prefer to launch this stuff just as they launch
Titans _ in secrecy.''
   NASA is allowing its regular day shift, about 12,800 workers, to
be on duty.

   For $67,500 you can buy a slice of Civil
War history: 38 acres of the battleground where Gen. Ulysses S.
Grant led 33,000 Union soldiers against the Confederates in a one
of the conflict's decisive battles.
   Also included in the bargain: a four-bedroom, two-bath brick
house, barn, shed, dog pens, possible Yankee burial trench and an
option to dig for artifacts.
   Bennie Machost, an oilfield worker, knows the history of his
Champion Hill property, where Grant's forces defeated Lt. Gen. John
Clifford Pemberton's 30,000 men May 16, 1863. Grant already had
taken Jackson, about 25 miles to the east. Vicksburg, another 20
miles to the west, would soon fall.
   ``One of the battles was fought right here,'' the 58-year-old
Machost said, waving at the ridge that runs through his front yard.
   ``This right here was the Confederates' left,'' added son
Bernard Machost, 33, of Bolton. ``If they could have held this .
..''
   The elder Machost bought the property three or four years ago.
But he and his wife recently purchased a new home in Arkansas,
where they plan to run a convenience store.
   The family believes some of the heaviest fighting occurred on
their now-peaceful 38 wooded acres.
   The 8th Illinois and the 32nd Ohio regiments stormed across an
``all but impossible hollow,'' yelling fiercely as they charged the
Mississippians and a supporting Georgia infantry unit, according to
Edwin C. Bearss in his book ``Decision in Mississippi.''
   Bernard Machost, armed with maps from Bearss' book, believes
that hollow is on the eastern side of his father's land.
   He said the front yard was where Union soldiers overran the 1st
Mississippi Light Artillery, despite the refusal of Capt. Samuel J.
Ridley of Gluckstadt to desert his guns.
   Ridley singlehandedly continued to fire a cannon until pierced
by six Union Minie balls, Bearss' book says.
   ``They was begging him `Don't shoot! Don't shoot!' They was
going to take him prisoner,'' Bernard Machost said. ``He wouldn't
quit shooting, so they killed him.''
   The 1st Mississippi Light Artillery entered the battle with 82
men and ended up with eight. In all, 3,851 Confederates were
killed, wounded or reported missing. The Union lost a total of
2,441 men at Champion Hill, according to historian Bruce Catton.
   ``I've always wondered about that,'' Bernard Machost said,
pointing to a trench along the property's western edge. ``It don't
look like it ought to be there naturally. I've always wondered if
it might not have been a grave.''
   Neither father nor son have come across any artifacts.
   ``I've always wanted to get (a metal detector) and I never
did,'' Bernard Machost said.
   ``I wouldn't even know what to look for,'' his father said.
``One time I thought I'd get a metal detector and find a piece of
bolt or something, but I don't have time. My time is valuable.''
   He said he has refused requests to search the property, even
from a cousin.
   ``In fact, when I see 'em coming like they're going to dig, I
tell 'em to get off 'cause they're going to get shot,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A survey of educators in urban schools
indicates that a lack of resources and staff creates a negative
environment which decreases teacher effectiveness, a report
released Wednesday said.
   ``Our study shows what other studies have not looked at _ that
working conditions do make a difference,'' said Tom Corcoran, a
researcher with the Institute for Educational Leadership. ``They
effect people's willingness to commit to the school, perform their
jobs and how much work they are willing to give, their motivation.''
   Corcoran said the institute's study, entitled ``Working in Urban
Schools,'' validates ``what teachers' surveys had been saying for
years.''
   ``It's a practical matter to the extent that if you provide
better working conditions you get better work out of people and
kids,'' he said.
   The non-profit, Washington-based institute interviewed more than
400 teachers, principals and administrators at 31 schools in five
cities: Detroit, Denver, Indianapolis, New Orleans and Rochester,
N.Y.
   The findings in the 161-page report were endorsed by the
nation's main teacher unions _ the American Federation of Teachers
and the National Education Association.
   Of the educators interviewed, 75 percent said resources such as
teaching material and equipment were inadequate and more than 85
percent said insufficient staff was a problem.
   Thirty-four percent said poor working conditions _ including
run-down school buildings and heavy workloads for teachers _ were
hurting teacher performance. More than 40 percent said these
conditions were undermining teacher morale.
   ``We can't allow short-term needs _ supplies, physical plant,
etc. _ to denigrate teachers' morale to the point that long-term
goals and objectives are put off or forgotten,'' Michael Usdan,
institute president, said in a statement.
   Corcoran added: ``There was little disagreement among
respondents _ not just disgruntled teachers crying for more
dollars. Principals and school administrators echoed these
concerns.''
   Rachel Hedding, a member of the Rochester, N.Y. school board,
said the study ``tells you specifically what things will make it
better for adults and, therefore, for children.''
   More than half of the school staff members surveyed reported
problems with inadequate working space, which they attributed to
overenrollment, reductions in class sizes and space requirements
for special programs.
   The study said ``one respondent underscored the pessimism by
noting that her school had turned closets into classrooms, placed
the ditto machine in the women's restroom and the special education
staff into an unsafe closet with no ventilation, no windows and
exposed heating pipes.''
   Teachers often requested more support staff _ counselors,
specialists, social workers, security staff, nurses, teachers aides
_ rather than more classroom teachers.
   One teacher said, ``We are just able to deal with crisis
intervention _ no time for follow-through.''
   The survey recommended that school districts try to duplicate
conditions found in the best schools _ adequately maintained
physical plants, staff collegiality, teacher involvement in
decision-making and a sensitive but strong administrative
leadership.
   ``When these (factors) are present,'' the study said, ``teachers
are ready to commit long hours, under minimally adequate
conditions, to meet the needs of students.''

<HEAD>Noriega Attorneys: Drug Case is Political</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The drug indictment against Panama's military ruler
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was a political ploy intended to
pressure him on the Panama Canal Treaty, his attorneys argued in
documents unsealed Wednesday.
   But their 65-page motion asking for dismissal of the trafficking
charges makes no reference to Vice President George Bush or his
campaign, as prosecutors had feared when they asked that it be kept
under wraps.
   The motion was unsealed after the U.S. attorney's office found
it contained none of the possible ``blackmail'' they had feared
Noriega might use to bargain with the administration. Noriega has
claimed in the past he had information that could hurt the Bush
campaign.
   ``My concern was that they would use it as some sort of
political leverage, but they didn't,'' said Chief Deputy Assistant
U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie. ``I don't think there is anything
in there that is shocking.''
   ``Whatever information damaging to George Bush that may exist,
that information was not going to be raised in our motion unless it
was relevant to the case,'' said Noriega defense attorney Neal
Sonnett.
   Instead, the defense motion argued that the U.S. government has
no right to prosecute Noriega, who is a de facto head of state and
has diplomatic immunity. It also alleged he is being selectively
prosecuted for political reasons and that pre-trial publicity will
make it impossible to find an objective jury.
   The 12-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in
Miami in February accused Noriega of accepting $4.6 million in
bribes from Colombia's violent Medellin drug cartel. A grand jury
in Tampa indicted Noriega on three marijuana importation counts at
the same time.
   The motion filed in Miami and sealed Sept. 14 argues the
indictment was ``based upon impermissible considerations, including
political and foreign policy considerations.''
   Sonnett said one foreign policy issue was pressure by
conservatives in the Reagan administration to renegotiate the
Panama Canal Treaty, which was signed under the Carter
administration and hands full control of the canal over to Panama
at the end of this century.
   ``There were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty,'' Sonnett
said. ``We argue that it was one of the circumstances leading up to
a decision to attempt to get Noriega out of power.''
   The motion contains quotes from the news media made by Reagan
administration officials, such as Undersecretary of State Elliot
Abrams, that the defense says demonstrate the political nature of
the case.
   Abrams, for example, is quoted as saying in May that ``the
indictment drove Noriega crazy and gave us a terrific bargaining
tool.''
   The defense, calling the case against Noriega ``indictment
diplomacy,'' notes that in March the government offered to
guarantee it would not seek his extradition if he fled to Spain,
and in May offered to drop the indictments altogether if he left
Panama.

   This little piggy is to go to the market,
but her friends want her at home.
   Park officials at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore plan to
take Adrienne the pig to the butcher, but some people have launched
a save-the-pig petition drive.
   The pig, which is more than a year old, is one of several
animals at Chellberg Farm.
   ``The farm is being run as it was in the 1880s, and pigs go to
market,'' said Glen Alexander, assistant lakeshore superintendent.
``We don't feel that it's in the interest of good historical
representation ... to not market pigs.''
   But Adrienne's friends say she is no ordinary pig.
   ``It's like a petting zoo here,'' said Susie Cutler, a lawyer
who works in Chicago. ``Everyone's gotten attached to her. .. .This
is a silly policy.''
   Alexander counters that it is the park service's role to educate
children about the facts of life. He says one of those facts is
that pigs aren't pets.
   ``We're trying to teach children that one raises little pigs for
market size and markets them and makes them into the things they
eat for breakfast,'' he said.
   Adrienne's supporters will present 300 signatures on its
petition next week.

   Taxpayers here danced the night away, and may
have paid for street lights at the same time.
   About $35,000 was raised during Genoa's ``Candy Dance,'' a town
fund-raiser held last weekend. The dance started in 1919 as an
alternative to taxes to pay for improvements in this tiny town.
   Organizers said the take beats last year's dance revenues of
about $28,000. This year's dance, dinner and crafts fair drew an
estimated 20,000 people.
   Lillian Finnegan, daughter of a Genoa judge, started the event
after seeing a shipboard fund-raiser during a sea cruise. Women
passengers made candy and sold it to men. She suggested Genoa try
the same thing.
   The idea caught on, and since then, with only one lapse in 1963,
the dance has raised money to pay for street lights, fire trucks,
copy machines, snowplows and other items.

<HEAD>Loss Of Johnson's Gold Wounds Canadian Pride</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stripping of Ben Johnson's Olympic gold medal
in a drug scandal has wounded Canadian pride and shamed a nation
hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky.
   ``It's like Wayne Gretzky getting run over by a car,'' said Pat
Reid, the Canadian high-jump coach.
   The spirit of a nation raced with Johnson when he won the gold
medal in the 100 meters on Saturday with a world record time of
9.79 seconds. The euphoria was dashed when Johnson tested positive
for stanzolol, a muscle-building steroid outlawed by Olympic
officials. He was stripped of the medal Tuesday.
   Dr. George Astaphan, Johnson's personal physician, and Larry
Heidebrecht, Johnson's agent, insisted the sprinter had not taken
stanzolol.
   ``The only thing we can say is that it is a tragedy, a mistake
or sabotage,'' Heidebrecht said.
   Johnson, a 26-year-old Jamaican transplant, waved the Canadian
flag in triumph and dedicated his gold to his mother and all
Canadian citizens.
   He returned home with a jacket over his head, hurdling a hedge
to duck reporters after flying home from New York in the seclusion
of a jet cockpit.
   It was unheroic conduct for the world's fastest human, who had
been awarded the Order of Canada and a medal from Queen Elizabeth
at the Commonwealth Games.
   Johnson's disgrace was heralded in Canadian headlines such as
``Fool's Gold,'' ``Black Day For Canada,'' ``Seconds Of Glory,
Years Of Shame,'' ``From Fame To Shame,'' and ``Big Ben is Now
Has-Ben.''
   ``We're feeling low. Some of us don't want to accept what
happened,'' said John Furedy, a psychologist at the University of
Toronto, in assessing the mational psyche.
   ``We all share some of the responsibility in the sense that we
put such tremendous pressure on these people,'' Furedy said.
   Trent Frayne, sports columnist for the Globe and Mail of
Toronto, said Johnson's victory was the biggest event in Canada
since a national team beat the Soviet Union in a seven-game hockey
series in 1972.
   The drug scandal brought the same sickening feeling to the
nation as did Gretzky's trade to the Los Angeles Kings.
   ``There was enormous exhilaration. Then 72 hours later, there
was this roller coaster ride to the bottom,'' Frayne said. ``The
Ben Johnson episode is a tragedy of shocking proportions.''
   ``It's as if an entire country has gone into a period of
national mourning on his behalf,'' wrote columnist John Robertson
of the Toronto Star.
   Canadian youth took the news hard.
   ``We look up to the guy. I guess we don't look up to him
anymore,'' said Craig Brown, 13, of Toronto.
   ``He's letting all his fans down. He let Canada down,'' said
Donny Clarke, 12.
   Canada has always tried to escape the influence of the United
States, where its dollar is worth 80 cents. Now it has forfeited
its only gold medal of the Olympics.
   ``He has left Canadians hanging their heads in shame,'' wrote
the Corner Brook Western Star.
   ``He tarnished the name and reputation of Canada and let its
people down,'' said the Fredickton Gleaner.
   But columnist Gary Lautens of the Toronto Star said the nation
should not cover its head in shame.
   ``What Johnson did was wrong. It's cheating. It's believing the
end justifies the means, it's looking for an unfair edge,'' Lautens
said. ``But it is also just a foot race. It's time somebody
reminded us nobody tried to peddle arms for hostages, nobody shot
down a civilian airliner, nobody booby-trapped a home.''

<TEXT>
   Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun
said Wednesday his troops will prevent Lebanon from being
partitioned. Rival Moslem and Christian cabinets appeared to take
steps to avoid a confrontation.
   Late Wednesday, a car bomb exploded at a Syrian army checkpoint
just south of Beirut, killing five people and injuring 21, police
said. They said five Syrian soldiers were among the injured. No one
claimed responsibility.
   Aoun, 53, made his pledge in an order of the day to the
42,000-man army.
   ``The Lebanese army is the only source to save Lebanon from
partition in spite of all regional and international pressures. ...
The solution is through you, and with you the crisis will end,''
the order said.
   ``Any other solution without you will fail. You know perfectly
well that nothing but the army can save Lebanon from occupation and
partition,'' Aoun said.
   Aoun was rejected by Lebanon's Moslem majority after he was
appointed prime minister by President Amin Gemayel on Thursday in
the last minutes of the president's term.
   Parliament failed to elect a new president, and Gemayel named a
new cabinet to serve as an interim government. The appointment
violated an unwritten covenant requiring the president to be a
Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the Parliament
speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   Aoun directly controls four brigades of about 15,000 men based
in east Beirut and the Christian heartland north of the capital.
   Five other brigades of about 18,000 men based in west Beirut and
southern, northern and eastern Lebanon, have pledged allegiance to
the government of Syrian-backed acting prime minister Salim Hoss, a
Sunni Moslem.
   The Hoss government was scheduled to meet on Wednesday with the
intention of firing Aoun and naming a pro-Syrian Maronite Catholic
officer as commander of the army, sources close to Hoss said.
   ``But Hoss called off the meeting and delayed the appointment of
a new army commander to avert a further escalation in a conflict
between the two governments,'' one source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   In another move apparently aimed at defusing the tension, Hoss,
who heads the Syrian-backed five-man cabinet, told reporters at his
west Beirut residence that his cabinet will not make any decisions
that will confuse government and civil service departments.
   ``We shall try to keep them going the way they have been before
the crisis developed,'' Hoss said.
   Aoun and Hoss have issued contradictory directives to civil
servants since last Thursday.
   Aoun, in his statement to the army, did not mention the Hoss
government, which all his previous statements branded illegal.
   Also Wednesday, former president Suleiman Franjieh, one of
Syria's strongest Maronite Catholic allies in Lebanon, arrived in
west Beirut a day before the start of a conference of pro-Syrian
leaders opposed to Aoun.
   It was Franjieh's first visit to Beirut's Moslem sector since
the outbreak of Lebanon's civil war in 1975 when he was president.
   Syria, Lebanon's main power broker, backed 78-year-old Franjieh
in August's presidential election, touching off a confrontation
with right-wing Christian militants.
   In a related development, the new U.S. ambassador urged Moslems
and Christians to speedily elect a new president to resolve the
impasse.
   Ambassador John McCarthy met with Moslem leaders to discuss the
current deadlock.
   He met with Sheik Hassan Khaled, spiritual head of the Sunni
Moslem sect; Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, spiritual head of the
Shiite sect; and Nabih Berri, the main Shiite Moslem militia
chieftain.
   McCarthy told reporters he stressed to the Moslem leaders the
importance of carrying out the elections as soon as possible.
   ``It seems to me that the religious leaders of Lebanon have a
very firm grip on what is needed for this country,'' McCarthy added.

<HEAD>Dukakis Black Ad Campaign Thus Far Lacks Jackson</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dukakis campaign unveiled advertisements
aimed at the black community Wednesday, but they lacked the voice
and image of the nation's most prominent black leader, Jesse
Jackson.
   Producers of the $3 million-plus ad campaign said Jackson thus
far had been unavailable to spend two or three hours taping radio
and television spots, but said they were confident of recording him
this week.
   ``He is committed to making advertising,'' said Frank L. Mingo,
president of the agency hired by Michael Dukakis' presidential
campaign to produce the ads. ``We simply haven't been able to catch
up with him.''
   Jackson last visited New York on Saturday. ``He is planning to
tape,'' said a spokeswoman in Chicago, Tanya Mitchell. Asked when,
she said, ``We don't have any information to release on that just
yet.''
   Mingo's print ads for Dukakis do not include a photograph of
Jackson. They do bear a quote _ ``10 reasons why we must work for,
fight for, vote for Michael Dukakis'' _ over Jackson's name and a
listing of the reasons.
   The print ads show a photo of Dukakis shaking hands with a black
woman as another black woman looks on.
   ``We made the decision that if we made a photo of Rev. Jackson
maybe it looks more like a Rev. Jackson ad,'' Mingo said at a news
conference in his Manhattan office. ``This is a Dukakis ad. I mean,
he is the candidate.''
   There has been friction between Jackson and the Dukakis campaign
over Jackson's role in the campagin. However, Mingo said that has
passed, citing Jackson' praise for Dukakis last week before the
Congressional Black Caucus.
   Other black leaders in the advertising campaign include Reps.
William Gray of Pennsylvania, Mickey Leland of Texas, John Lewis of
Georgia, Mervyn Dymally of California and Floyd Flake of New York
and the Washington, D.C., delegate, Walter Fauntroy.
   Mingo said ads would be placed in national black magazines and
newspapers and in 15 broadcast markets, beginning this week.
   ``It is far easier for me to go to Washington and grab a bunch
of congressmen and sit them down in a room than it is to find Rev.
Jackson,'' Mingo said. ``You have to track him down on his own
terms and you have to sit him down.''
   ``We are working with his staff to schedule time to do it,''
Mingo said. ``And of course, some of that has to be when he wants
to do it.''

   The conversation was out of ear-shot but photographers said the

   Sting wasn't there, but Bruce Springsteen and Peter

   The seven-hour concert Tuesday was part of Amnesty's $23 million
rock extravaganza scheduled to play to 20 nations in five
continents. The tour hopes to collect 1 billion signatures on a
petition endorsing universal human rights and protesting
incarceration of political prisoners.
   Other singers on the tour include Tracy Chapman and Senegal's
Youssou N'Dour. Sting, who took part in earlier shows, was absent
in Tokyo because of conflicting schedules, organizers said.
   While it seemed Japanese fans were more intent on moving with

their job.
   ``The people will walk away with some message,'' he said.

bundle of joy.
   ``For the first time I agree with people who are depressed about
the future,'' the singer-songwriter said. ``It's amazing how the
imperialist nations have paid for their imperialism. It's almost as
if there were a God _ almost, but not quite.''
   In the album's first single, ``It's Money That Matters,'' a
narrator asks people the meaning of life. They answer with the
song's title.
   ``We all should be smart enough to know that money doesn't make
us happy,'' said Newman, 45. ``The trouble is that in America the
smart people who opt for a life that isn't based on getting rich _
who decide to teach chemistry or work for a public radio station _
get their faces rubbed in it.
   ``Through television, people in this country who don't have a
lot are constantly reminded that life could be more comfortable,''
he said.

   Wayne Newton won a round Wednesday in
his battle to develop part of a 241-acre retreat at Lake Tahoe.
   The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency endorsed a land use change
that opens the way for the Las Vegas superstar to develop 15 acres
near a trout-filled lake.
   The panel acted without discussion. Milton Sharp, Newton's
project engineer, said the entertainer hasn't told him what he
plans to do with the scenic property, acquired in 1985 for $2.5
million. Additional permits would be needed for any construction.
   Newton filed a $7.2 million-plus lawsuit last year, claiming he
was unable to develop his Tahoe property because of ordinances
adopted by the regional planning agency. The lawsuit is still
pending.

<TEXT>
   Air Force ``pararescue
jumpers'' will be on alert Thursday across the Atlantic Ocean from
Cape Canaveral, ready to help rescue the Discovery astronauts
should they need to use the space shuttle's new escape system.
   Eighteen of the so-called ``PJs'' were dispatched last Wednesday
from here to Gambia and Morocco on Africa's northwest coast. They
are members of the 1730th Pararescue Squadron, the only unit in the
U.S. military dedicated solely to rescue work.
   Nine jumpers from the New York Air National Guard are stationed
at Patrick Air Force Base near Cape Canaveral to provide rescue
assistance should the astronauts bail out of the shuttle closer to
Florida than to Africa. Also working out of Patrick are 18 other
PJs aboard rescue helicopters.
   Members of the 1730th _ all experienced jumpers and trained as
paramedics _ approached the shuttle assignment with enthusiasm.
   ``They usually trample each other to get a mission,'' Col.
Edward Behling, the squadron commander, said in an interview.
``It's like a fire department. You only get a fire once in a
while.''
   The shuttle escape system, ordered by Congress after the
Challenger disaster nearly three years ago, can be used only after
the spacecraft's solid rocket boosters are jettisoned two minutes
into the flight. Thus the new system would not have saved the
Challenger astronauts.
   If the shuttle fails to reach orbit once the boosters drop off,
the astronauts could attempt to slide out an escape hatch and
parachute into the ocean. With the mission more than two minutes
underway, the escape would likely be closer to Africa than the U.S.
Atlantic coast.
   ``We'll be there to catch them if they fall,'' said Tech. Sgt.
John Smith, who heads the group deployed in Morocco.
   Each of the two nine-member groups jump from a C-130 Hercules
cargo plane. The astronauts probably would scatter several miles
apart. Each has an emergency transmitter that would automatically
activate and a motorized rubber boat and medical supplies would be
parachuted from 3,000 feet _ along with the PJs _ once astronauts
were located.
   Three-person PJ teams would man their boats and begin picking up
astronauts, each working toward the middle of the drop area where
several life rafts and survival material would be located.
   ``Our first concern is finding the astronauts,'' said Smith.
``The second is that the C-130 have enough fuel to stay above the
search area and give us vectors to where each of the astronauts
are. If you're out there in rough waters you can't see someone
who's 20 feet away because of the swells.''
   Each PJ is trained to administer drugs and intravenous solutions
if necessary, Behling said. Experience with pilots who have ejected
from aircraft indicates medical attention often is necessary to
treat broken bones and other injuries.
   The shuttle duty is similar to normal rescue operations
performed by the squadron. But it did require development and
acquisition of the motorized inflatable boats, equipment long in
the planning stage but stuck there until NASA requested assistance
with the astronaut rescue system.
   ``NASA for some reason raises people's priorities in the Air
Force,'' Behling said. He said the motorized boats will improve the
unit's overall rescue capability.
   The 1730th has a long association with the space program.
   The Navy had primary responsibility for recovering space
capsules that landed in the Atlantic after their missions. The
1730th was on standby during those earlier flights and Behling said
at least twice Air Force PJs located astronaut crews from
spacecraft that landed further than expected from Navy ships.

   The curator of Ronnie DeSillers' estate has sued a
savings and loan to recover nearly $200,000 she claims the thrift
allowed to be improperly withdrawn by the boy's mother.
   Court-appointed curator Karen Gievers on Tuesday filed suit in
Dade Circuit Court against Coral Gables Federal Savings & Loan for
allowing Maria DeSillers to withdraw and spend the money, which was
donated to pay for Ronnie's medical bills and to help other young
liver transplant patients.
   The withdrawal, she argued, was contrary to state law. The
thrift knew the purpose of the money, Ms. Gievers alleged.
   Seven-year-old Ronnie died at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital in
April 1987 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant, and his mother
has been involved in legal disputes ever since for refusing to pay
the balance of the boy's medical bills. She claims her son received
improper care, which the hospital denies.
   DeSillers is accused of withdrawing about $260,000 from the
Coral Gables Federal account, but less than $60,000 has been
recovered. The money was allegedly spent on a used BMW car and
jewelry, and some was given to her ex-husband and her boyfriend.
   Some $690,000 were donated to Ronnie from around the country,
including $1,000 from President Reagan and $200,000 from Miami
Beach industrialist Victor Posner, after a small fund collected by
his school was repored stolen.
   Meanwhile, DeSillers' boyfriend and former fiance, Jose
Castillo, pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges that he pawned stolen
computer equipment.
   Castillo, who is free on bond, is charged with third-degree
grand theft for possession of the stolen computer and with unlawful
consignment of property to a pawn shop. DeSillers accompanied
Castillo to the Broward County pawn shop April 2. Circuit Judge Mel
Grossman scheduled trial for Nov. 7.

<HEAD>Last Survivor Of Those Convicted in Brink's Robbery Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Adolph ``Jazz'' Maffie, the last survivor of those
convicted in the 1950 Brink's robbery that was then the largest in
U.S. history, has died. He was 77.
   Maffie died Sunday at Brigham and Women's Hospital after a long
illness.
   There were 11 participants in the Jan. 17, 1950, robbery, in
which seven men wearing Halloween masks took $1.2 million in cash
and $1.5 million in checks and securities from the Brink's counting
room in Boston.
   It took the FBI six years to solve the case, and eventually nine
men went to prison. But only $57,000 was ever recovered.
   Where did all the money go?
   ``Gambling and supporting a family for six years prior to our
arrest,'' Francis ``Sandy'' Richardson said during a 1977 publicity
stunt at the scene of the crime to promote ``The Brink's Job,'' a
book and film about the heist.
   Authorities sai the robbery was planned in Maffie's living room.
   Maffie was convicted of armed robbery in 1956 and sentenced to
life in prison, but his sentence was commuted by then-Gov. John
Volpe, and he was released on Dec. 22, 1969, after serving nearly
14 years.
   The other men convicted in the robbery who were still alive got
out of prison between 1967 and 1971. Five of the robbers worked
with the authors of ``The Brink's Job'' for a share of the profits.
   After being released, Maffie joined his family in Quincy and
worked as a car salesman.
   He had scrapes with the law as a youth and was convicted of tax
evasion in 1952.
   He is survived by a son, a daughter, three brothers, a sister,
four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
   A funeral Mass was scheduled Thursday in Sacred Heart Church in
North Quincy.

<HEAD>FBI Investigating Police Activities Following Clash After Football
Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLINTON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI confirms it is investigating
allegations that officers beat three black people during a clash
between high school students and police outside a pizza parlor
earlier this month.
   ``Police were extremely barbaric and instigated the incident,''
said the Rev. George Ferrell. ``We are not going to stand for this
type of behavior.''
   J. Stewart Murphy, a spokesman for the FBI in Jackson, said
Tuesday that the complaint was being investigated, and findings
will be sent to the U.S. office of civil rights in Washington.
   Ferrell, a member of a black citizens group that is conducting
its own investigation of the incident, said a black man and his
wife were struck by police on Sept. 16 in the parking lot of the
restaurant. Police had been called there to quell fights among high
school students after a football game.
   In addition, Ferrell said, racial slurs were directed at the
couple and their 4-year-old daughter. He said that a short time
later, a man was beaten after he inquired about the police's action
against the couple.
   All three adults were arrested _ Ercolani D. Pauline, 22; his
20-year-old wife, Bettina; and Wilbert Green, 20, all of Clinton.
They were each charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest
and assault on a police officer, Police Chief Don Byington said.
   Ferrell said the three had been to the Friday night Callway
High-Clinton High football game and stopped by the restaurant
afterward.
   Byington said he believed his officers acted properly during the
clash at the restaurant, which carried over from trouble among fans
at the football game.
   ``There were several fights that were broken up at the game,''
he said. After the game, several hundred young people converged at
the restaurant, and the restaurant manager called police when
fights developed in the parking lot, Byington said.
   Ferrell said he believed the Sept. 16 incident was behind recent
shoving and purshing incidents between black and white students at
Clinton High School.
   Green said he had been advised not to comment. The Paulines
couldn't be reached for comment; there was no answer Wednesday at
the telephone listed in Clinton.

<HEAD>Rocketing of Kabul Kills 35; Attacks Reported on Other Afghan
Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels in Afghanistan sprayed rockets into the
capital, and one missile exploding near a downtown bus stop killed
35 people and wounded more than 150, the Tass news agency said
Wednesday.
   The attack, believed to be the deadliest ever by anti-Marxist
insurgents on Kabul, was reported one day after Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told journalists the Kremlin had
halted its military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Shevardnadze on Wednesday cut short his participation in the
U.N. General Assembly session in New York to return to Moscow for
what his spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said was a meeting of the
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee.
   It was not immediately known whether the committee would discuss
the situation in Afghanistan. Gerasimov said the meeting would make
high-level personnel changes and revamp the party's structure.
   In its report from Kabul, Tass said that in the space of one
hour, ``extremists'' fired 21 surface-to-surface rockets into the
Afghan capital. It did not say what day the attack occurred.
   ``One of the rockets exploded near a bus stop in the center of
the city, killing 35 and wounding another 156 civilians,'' Tass
said.
   Tass said seven people were wounded in other parts of Kabul.
Over the past two days, it said, rebel rocket bombardments caused
``civilian casualties and widespread destruction'' in residential
areas of the capitals of Ghazni, Laghman, Nangarhar, Balkh, Paktia
and Parwan provinces and of Khost district.
   For months, the Soviets have accused Pakistan of violating
U.N.-brokered accords on Afghanistan by funneling arms, including
rockets, to U.S.-backed rebels battling the pro-Moscow government
of President Najib.
   The agreement obligates the Soviets to withdraw their more than
100,000 troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets announced that half of their troops were back home
by Aug. 15, in accordance with the agreement. But on
Tuesday,Shevardnadze told reporters at the United Nations that the
Soviets have not begun the second stage of the pullout.
   He did not say how the Soviets would react if the alleged
violations continue.
   ``Let's wait and see,'' Shevardnadze said. ``It is necessary to
stop the violations that take place. It is the most important
thing.''
   Soviet media made no mention Wednesday of Shevardnadze's remarks
or of a pause in the Soviet pullout, perhaps because of widespread
hopes kindled in the country when the withdrawal began.
   Valentin Falin, head of the government press agency Novosti,
told a reporter at a reception Wednesday the pause was due to ``the
actions of the other side.'' He referred to U.S. and Pakistani arms
supplies to the Afghan rebels.
   Although the Kremlin's role in Afghanistan was supported by many
Soviets, an increased number had begun to regard the mounting
Soviet casualties as pointless. By Soviet count, more than 13,000
Soviet soldiers died in Afghanistan.
   In a speech to the General Assembly earlier Tuesday,
Shevardnadze asked the five members of the U.N. Security Council to
discuss violations of the withdrawal agreement with Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
   He did not name Pakistan, but the Soviet Union has filed
numerous complaints with the United Nations saying that Pakistan is
allowing the U.S.-backed insurgents to launch raids into
Afghanistan from bases in Pakistan.
   ``This cannot be allowed to happen,'' Shevardnadze said. ``We're
not complaining to anyone. We have the means to make things fall
into place. But we are responsible to the United Nations and
therefore are appealing to it.''
   Pakistan has been a major backer of about 200,000
anti-government guerrillas. The United States and China have also
given support to the rebels.
   The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979 and presided
over the replacement of one Marxist ruler by another. They stayed
on to fight a widespread insurgency and to prop up Najib's
government.
   The withdrawal from Afghanistan has been one of the tangible
manifestations of Gorbachev's more conciliatory foreign policy, and
Soviets cite it as proof that their current leadership is seeking
peaceful accommodation with the West.
   In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday it expects
Soviet authorities will comply with their commitment to remove all
Soviet forces from Afghanistan.
   ``There is no reason why they should not meet this obligation
and we expect the Soviets to honor the obligations they undertook.
There is no evidence they will not do this,'' deputy spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said.

   NASA officials, who have said since
the Challenger disaster that spaceflight will never be risk-free,
were asked on Wednesday what would happen if there were another
catastrophe.
   ``I think the space program certainly will survive in any
case,'' deputy administrator Dale D. Myers told reporters on the
eve of Discovery's flight.
   ``We've done everything we know to make a safe flight out of
this thing; we are certainly aware there is risk in programs of
this nature. We think it's a low enough risk that we are
recognizing it and accepting that risk.''
   Myers said it is inevitable that spaceflight will continue.
   ``Americans want to explore,'' he said. ``I think the world
wants to explore. A manned spaceflight program is the next frontier
that man has always reached for. I don't think there would be a
secession of manned space flight.''
   But, Myers added, ``I think there would be one heck of another
investigation before we got under way again.''

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze cut short his participation in the U.N. General
Assembly today to return to Moscow for a meeting devoted to
reorganizing the Communist Party apparatus.
   ``There will be changes in the working of our political
structure,'' foreign ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said.
``In this sense, the plenum is very important.''
   Shevardnadze planned to fly home tonight to attend the Communist
Party Central Committee session. All members of the committee who
are abroad, including a number of ambassadors, had been summoned,
Gerasimov said.
   The session was long-planned but the specific date had not been
set until now, Gerasimov told reporters.
   ``He has to cut it short, unfortunately,'' Gerasmiov said. ``The
plenary will be devoted to reorganization of the party apparatus,
including the Central Committee itself.''
   The spokesman said the session would begin on Friday and would
go on for a day or two. ``It will bring some administrative
changes,'' Gerasimov said.
   Asked if the purpose of the meeting was to take up recent ethnic
unrest in Armenia, Gerasimov said, ``It has nothing to do with this
situation.''
   Gerasimov said the aim was to make sure the party was concerned
mainly with ``strategic thinking and not to interfere, as it does
now, in day-to-day affairs of the government.''
   Before flying home, Shevardnadze planned to meet with Secretary
of State George P. Shultz and the foreign ministers of China,
Britain and France.
   The session, held annually during the special session of the
U.N. General Assembly, had been scheduled for Friday.
   It was moved up to accommodate Shevardnadze, although Shultz
will meet with British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Foreign
Ministers Roland Dumas of France and Qian Qichen of China on Friday
as well.
   The Soviet foreign minister did not cancel a planned meeting
with Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate for president,
in a midtown hotel.
   Shultz intended to take up with Shevardnadze U.S. complaints
that the Soviets and the Soviet-supported government in Afghanistan
were conducting bombing raids on positions in Pakistan.
   Shultz condemned the cross-border raids on Tuesday as a
violation of Pakistani territory. They are designed to interrupt
the flow of U.S. weapons through Pakistan to guerrillas in
Afghanistan fighting the Kabul government.
   While Shevardnadze scrambled his schedule, Shultz proceeded with
a day-long series of meetings with the foreign ministers of West
Germany, Israel, Turkey, Poland and other governments.
   On Tuesday, in a brief news conference in a U.N. hallway,
Shevardnadze said the Soviets had suspended the withdrawal of the
Red Army from Afghanistan.
   He said the Geneva accords signed April 14 provided for removal
of the troops and assured Pakistan's territorial integrity. The
Soviets claim Pakistan was allowing the rebels to launch raids from
Pakistan.

<HEAD>Man Remains On Death Row 18 Months After Execution Blocked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A severely retarded prisoner is still on
Georgia's death row 18 months after a state Supreme Court barred
his execution.
   His trial judge retired, his attorneys went on to other matters
and the prisoner, Johnny Mack Westbrook, apparently fell through
the cracks.
   ``The whole thing sort of slipped my mind,'' said Joe Briley,
district attorney for the Ocmulgee Circuit. ``He's been in no
danger of being executed. His attorney and I have discussed how the
resentencing would be handled. But you know you get involved in
other things and you just never get back to it.''
   Westbrook's attorney, Charles Mathis of Milledgeville, said he
had discussed the case with Briley. ``I don't think I left him in
the lurch,'' Mathis said recently.
   Psychologists say Westbrook has an IQ of 25 to 50 and a mental
capacity of a child 3 to 8 years old.
   Defense attorneys argued that Westbrook had followed another man
in 1977 when the pair kidnapped and killed two women.
   Although Briley admitted that Westbrook was unfairly treated as
a youth _ he served 20 years for stealing $300 worth of property _
the district attorney described the 1977 killings as ``among the
cruelest things I've ever seen. I think he ought to be executed.''
   A defense psychologist testified that people with Westbrook's
mentality ``never take social rules and apply them ... because
their reasoning just isn't there.''
   The first conviction in 1977 was thrown out. The jury in the
second trial in 1985 recommended that Westbrook be given life
without parole.
   Judge Joseph B. Duke of the Ocmulgee Judicial Circuit rejected
the verdict on the grounds that the jury could not consider parole.
The jury then returned a death sentence.
   The state Supreme Court affirmed the convictions, but ruled 18
months ago that the initial recommendation of mercy blocked the
death penalty.
   Briley has tentatively set Westbrook's resentencing for Oct. 13.

   A Navy diver who died on the
tarmac of Beirut airport after being shot on a hijacked plane was
beaten so brutally that he was too weak to feed himself, a witness
testified Wednesday.
   Elizabeth Howes, a flight attendant aboard TWA Flight 847, also
told a court that one of the two gunmen who hijacked the jetliner
terrorized passengers with a hand grenade and made them squeeze
under the seats.
   Ms. Howes, who testified at the trial of hijacker Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, said she was shaken when she saw the condition of Robert
Stethem, who was later shot and thrown off the plane.
   She said the beatings started shortly after the Athens-to-Rome
flight was hijacked on June 14, 1985, and continued intermittently
until Stethem was killed early the next day.
   Ms. Howes said another flight attendant, Uli Derickson, helped
the 23-year-old diver to the back of the plane after he was hit
repeatedly with an iron bar.
   ``I was very upset to see him, and I used to be a nurse. (Mrs.
Derickson) had to hold him by the arm, support him so he could
walk,'' Ms. Howes testified during Hamadi's murder and air piracy
trial.
   Passenger Clinton Suggs testified earlier in the trial that he
heard Stetham scream and Hamadi said, ``Let the pig suffer!'' when
Derickson asked the hijackers if she could loosen Stethem's bound
hands.
   When the hijackers permitted the flight attendants to serve
meals, Ms. Howes said she gave Stethem a tray of food.
   ``As I handed him the tray, the Australian girl sitting next to
him said she would help him with the food,'' Ms. Howes said.
   ``I said to him, `How are you doing,' and he just nodded. He was
so badly injured,'' she said.
   Richard and Patricia Stethem, the parents of the slain sailor
from Waldorf, Md., have attended the trial since it began July 5.
The elder Stethem took notes on Wednesday's proceedings, while his
wife sat quietly nearby.
   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking, during which
39 Americans were held captive for 17 days, but denies involvement
in Stethem's murder, which he blames on the second hijacker.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage.
   On Wednesday, Hamadi, dressed in a short-sleeved sports shirt,
glanced at his translator, whose lips could be seen moving rapidly
as she related Ms. Howes' testimony to him in Arabic. For security
reasons, Ms. Howes did not give her nationality or home address.
   She said she feared Hamadi less during the hijacking than a
second terrorist on the airplane, known to the passengers as Said,
and identified in a U.S. indictiment as Hassan Ezzeddine.
   ``I believe I was more afraid of Said. He appeared to be more
nervous, especially with a hand grenade in his hand. Hamadi
appeared to be more relaxed with the gun in his hand, and did most
of the negotiating,'' said Ms. Howes.
   Other witnesses have testified that Hamadi had a gun just before
and after Stethem was shot and thrown onto the runway in Beirut,
where the plane was forced to land.
   ``Hamadi was the first to go down the aisle, and had a gun in
his hand. The other, Said, had a hand grenade in one hand.''
   ``Later they forced all to squeeze into the seats, Said with the
hand grenade in his hand, forcing people to get down on the floor
beneath the seats,'' said Ms. Howes.
   ``We were forced to put our heads between our knees. Those who
didn't were hit on the head,'' she said.
   Asked to comment on Ms. Howes' testimony, Hamadi said off the
witness stand: ``I have absolutely nothing to say.''
   On Tuesday, flight attendant Hazel Hesp said she did not believe
Hamadi killed Stethem.
   Asked by Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger if she had an opinion
about who killed Stethem, Ms. Hesp said: ``Yes. But I did not see
the shot, so it is only my opinion. It would be my opinion that it
would be Said who shot.''
   Ms. Hesp said she felt Hamadi was taking orders from Ezzeddine.
   ``I think Said (Ezzeddine) was the leader. He seemed to be
giving the orders,'' she said.

   The State Department said Wednesday it is
disturbed by Israel's use of plastic bullets against Palestinian
demonstrators, contending that the policy is leading to rising
casualties in the occupied territories.
   According to published reports, at least three Palestinians have
been killed and 70 wounded since the Israeli Army began using
plastic bullets a month ago. The bullets have been described by
their defenders as non-lethal.
   ``We believe that measures must be taken to reduce rather than
to increase casualties among Palestinian demonstrators,'' State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   ``Thus we are disturbed by the rising casualties of Palestinians
in recent clashes with the Israeli military. We can see no
justification for a policy admittedly designed to cause an increase
in casualties.''

   City officials said they hope to prosecute
two supporters of Vice President George Bush who were hosts at a
party where college students allegedly chanted the Pledge of
Allegiance too loudly.
   Mayor Roy Young Jr. said Wednesday the city considers it just
another of many excessive-noise cases it is pursuing. ``This
particular one is getting a whole lot of buildup, but it happens to
be one of 17 that were done that night,'' Young said.
   Though the city wants charges pressed, William Sherman, an
assistant Butler County prosecutor, obtained a two-week delay of
the case Tuesday, telling a judge his office wanted to further
investigate the incident and determine whether it could be
prosecuted.
   Karen Stevens and Kimberly Mart, the two Miami University
students cited, said they were ready to defend themselves against
the misdemeanor charge of exceeding the city's allowable noise
level.
   They scurried to court after distributing campaign buttons at a
rally for Bush, who appeared on the Miami University campus
Tuesday. Bush has made the Pledge of Allegiance a major campaign
theme.
   Ms. Stevens, 21, and Ms. Mart, 22, said police harassed them
even though the women said they had taken precautions to hold down
the noise.
   The police went to the party at least twice. The women said they
came the first time because they were invited to come and take a
noise reading to make sure the sound wasn't excessive.
   The second time the police came, they cited the two women after
a guest, standing on a trench holding iced beer kegs, jokingly led
other partygoers in the chant of the Pledge of Allegiance as the
policemen measured the noise level.
   ``It was a calm party,'' Ms. Mart said. ``We really feel like we
were picked on.'' There were no complaints from neighbors, the
women said.
   Oxford's ordinance restricts acceptable noise levels to 70
decibels most times and 55 decibels at night. Police said the noise
level at the women's party reached 85 decibels.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Expels Two British Military Attaches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia on Wednesday
accused two British military attaches of spying and ordered them
expelled. Britain said the move was in retaliation for London's
expulsion of three Czechoslovak diplomats last week.
   The official news agency CTK said Britain's most senior diplomat
in Prague, charge d'affaires John MacGregor, was summoned to the
Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry and told that Wing Commander John
Maynard and Warrant Officer Graham Addy had 14 days to leave the
country.
   Both men were guilty of ``activity incompatible with their
diplomatic status,'' CTK said, using a phrase that in diplomatic
parlance means espionage.
   On Sept. 22, Britain accused three diplomats at Prague's embassy
in London of spying and gave them 14 days to leave.
   The three are Czechoslovakia's assistant military attache, Maj.
Bedrich Kramar, air attache Maj. Vlastimil Netolicky and Pavel
Moudry, a member of the commercial section.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman denied that the Britons
ordered out of Czechoslovakia were spies. He said the move was
``definitely a retaliation'' for Britain's expulsion orders.
   ``We have said we want to develop relations with Czechoslovakia,
but the action of the three diplomats in London didn't help and
this does not help either,'' the spokesman told The Associated
Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They (the Czechoslovakian authorities) gave us the usual thing
that these men were involved in the gathering of information of an
intelligence nature,'' said the spokesman.
   He said Maynard, 54, has been posted in Prague since May 1986
and Addy, 36, since June 1986. Both men are married and each has
three children.
   As Britain did last week, Czechoslovakia emphasized that it
wanted to build better bilateral relations but said the alleged
espionage ``is an obstacle,'' according to CTK.
   Wednesday's expulsions brought to seven the number of
Czechoslovak diplomats that Britain has ordered out since 1983. Two
were expelled in 1983 and two more in 1984. That year,
Czecholsovakia expelled two Britons in an apparent reprisal.

   _The Daily Telegraph (conservative), London: ``Misgivings about

British people have had no opportunity to assess him because he has
never visited London, Paris or Bonn. So little interest in our
concerns is bound to be unnerving. ... He is currently trying to
cultivate an image of greater toughness. But it will take more than
a snapshot (of Dukakis) in a tank to dispel the impression of a man
with a strong disinclination to using force, and who appears to
believe that international affairs can be regulated by moral
imperatives and consensus management.
   ``As he demonstrated in the television contest, Mr. Bush is both
less articulate and less managerial-minded than his opponent. But
from a European point of view, he has more substantial advantages.
He knows us and our problems, and has seen enough of the world not
to expect too much of it. .. Europe has no vote, but is entitled to
a view. On present performance, better Bush.''

   Doctors transplanted segments of one liver into
two young children, the second time the surgery has been performed
in the United States, a hospital said Wednesday.
   The 16-month-old girl and 4{-month-old boy, both from Chicago,
were in critical but stable condition, customary after a
transplant, said Mary Fetsch, a spokeswoman for Wyler Children's
Hospital.
   A surgical team led by Christoph Broelsch began the operations
at 11:15 a.m. Tuesday and ended at 1 a.m. Wednesday, Ms. Fetsch
said.
   The liver was that of a 16-month-old Oregon boy, she said.
   The girl suffered from biliary atresia, or clogged bile ducts.
The boy's liver was scarred by an unknown cause, she said. The
children's parents asked that the hospital not release names.
   In July, Broelsch was the nation's first doctor to take segments
of one liver and transplant them into two people. Jaclyn Manrose of
Crystal Lake, who was 7 months old at the time, is in good health
at home, Ms. Fetsch said.
   The other youngster, 12-week-old Joseph Kovach of Geneva, died
of heart failure 36 hours after surgery.

<TEXT>
   A dying 15-year-old girl's last words led police
to arrest a man and charge him with murder in the fatal stabbings
of the teen-ager and her 3-year-old cousin, authorities said.
   Before Sandra Charles' death, ``she could speak very little,
(but) she managed to give us her first name and the suspect's first
name,'' said Police Detective Dennis Gafford.
   Preston Hughes III, a convicted sex offender, was charged
Tuesday with capital murder and is being held without bail.
   Hughes, 22, has admitted killing Miss Charles and her cousin,
Marcell Taylor, but claims the killings were the result of a
mistaken identity, investigators said.
   Miss Charles and her cousin were found late Monday lying near a
wooded path behind a restaurant in west Houston. The boy was dead
from two stab wounds to the chest and one to the back of the head,
Gafford said.
   Miss Charles, suffering from stab wounds to the neck and chest,
was rushed to West Houston Medical Center and then to Ben Taub
Hospital, where she died a short time later.
   Police said they believe the teen-ager was mortally injured
after she fought off a rape attempt, and the boy was killed either
to eliminate him as a witness or to stop him from crying.
   Hughes told police he was walking through a wooded lot behind
his apartment when he began ``thinking someone was after him,''
Gafford said. ``He's just saying that it was a mistaken identity
and they ended up getting stabbed.''
   ``He thought somebody had come up behind him, and he decided to
attack first instead of being attacked,'' Detective Ted Bloyd said.
   Hughes told police he was intoxicated at the time of the attack,
investigators said.
   Hughes, a department store employee, was arrested early Tuesday
at his apartment near the death scene, Gafford said. A knife with a
6-inch blade was recovered from the apartment, police said.
   Hughes was on probation after pleading guilty to raping a
13-year-old girl in 1985 and then later threatening the same
teen-ager with a gun, court records show.

   A police officer who fatally shot a gunman
despite his own wounds was honored as a hero Wednesday for his
courage in facing down the disturbed man, who had killed four
people including the officer's partner.
   Officer Gregory Jaglowski, speaking from a wheelchair during a
brief awards ceremony at Mount Sinai Hospital, said he only did
what any good police officer would have done and tearfully praised
his slain partner, Irma Ruiz.
   ``Irma Ruiz was a great woman, best friend and there's no better
partner you could ever have. Irma was always there ... she'll never
be forgotten. ... We miss you,'' Jaglowski said, his voice choked
off by sobs.
   Ruiz, a mother of four, was shot to death during the rampage
Friday by 40-year-old Clem Henderson. Henderson killed two workers
at an auto-parts store, then walked to the nearby Montefiore
School, where he fatally shot the custodian and Ruiz before being
felled by Jaglowski.
   The officer was shot in both legs and was to undergo surgery
later Wednesday to remove a bullet.
   Police praised his actions, saying the bloodshed could have been
much worse without his intervention.
   During the ceremony, Mayor Eugene Sawyer and Police
Superintendent LeRoy Martin awarded Jaglowski the Police
Department's Blue Star Award for wounds suffered in the line of
duty. He also received a meritorious promotion from patrol officer
to detective.
   ``Officer Jaglowski was wounded, but true to his training and
true to his code, Officer Jaglowski went back in'' and battled
heroically with the suspect, Martin said.
   ``Until last week, Officer Jaglowski went about his work in a
relatively quiet manner, but fate intervened,'' Sawyer said. ``His
record of the past 14 years shows he's always been a hero and a
great cop.''
   Jaglowski and Ruiz, both police youth officers, had been called
to the school to deal with an unruly youngster when they
encountered Henderson.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The movers and shakers in the world of plumbing
and wastewater treatment celebrated the opening Wednesday of a new
museum exhibit illustrating the plumber's role as guardian of the
nation's health.
   ``The average person flushes the closet and (they) don't know
what happens to the water. They don't realize what's all involved
in plumbing,'' said William Reichert, chairman of the Chicago
Plumbing Council.
   ``Our motto is, the plumbers protect the health of the nation.
The doctors take care of it _ but we protect it,'' said Reichert,
who began as an apprentice plumber in 1926 and now is president of
a local plumbing and heating company.
   About 200 people, many of them plumbing contractors, plumbing
inspectors or plumbing engineers, crowded into the new
2,200-square-foot exhibit at Chicago's Museum of Science and
Industry.
   The exhibit illustrates the flow of water in the Chicago area
from Lake Michigan through treatment plants, into the home, out the
toilet and into sewage treatment plants.
   Instead of the traditional ribbon-cutting, Mayor Eugene Sawyer
did the honors at a pipe-cutting ceremony, working up a sweat
slicing the pipe as some of the plumbers' wives snapped pictures.
   ``I've just earned my plumbing (union) card again,'' Sawyer
quipped. ``I used to be a member of the Plumbers Union because I
started out in the Water Department as a chemist.
   ``I understand how important it is that we in Chicago have clean
water,'' the mayor said.
   Reichert, proudly showing off the exhibit, said it was a tribute
to the plumber's role in modern society.
   The first section features seven animated transparencies showing
how the city's water system provides more than 1 billion gallons of
water daily to more than 7 million people.
   The next section, a series of full-scale cutaway rooms in a
house, features glass pipes instead of steel or cast iron, showing
how water flows through the kitchen, bathroom and laundry room.
   ``When you flush the closet, it shows how the closet works and
where the water goes,'' Reichert said. ``It's interesting. If you
have kids, you can bring them down and show them.''
   He pointed to a bend inside the bottom of the toilet, just
before the point where the water flows out, and noted that's where
most blockages occur.
   Reichert paused before a glass display case containing a fat,
two-foot chunk of weathered wood.
   ``Way back in Chicago in the 1800s, we had wooden water mains.
When they dug the subway they uncovered some of these,'' he said.
   ``And here's an old-time closet with a wooden tank like they had
way back when,'' Reichert said, pointing out an older model of
toilet.
   The final section of the exhibit is a walk-through theater
describing the history and wastewater treatment responsibilities of
the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Chicago.
   Frank Mucha of Chicago, a museum visitor, was among the first to
view the new exhibit.
   ``I think it's very nice. It's interesting and educational.''
   Mucha confessed he'd never given much thought to what happens
when the commode is flushed.
   ``I never paid any attention to it in the past. I had no idea
what happened.''

<HEAD>Report Says Government Is Losing Ability to Hire the Competent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is becoming a
frustrating place to work, where salaries are low, prestige is
falling, offices are seedy, and workers are subjected to
humiliating experiences and sapped of initiative, according to a
study ordered by Congress.
   As a result, the study says, at the very time the work is
becoming increasingly complicated and technical, the government is
losing its ability to attract qualified employees and it is left
with ``what some have suggested, only half jokingly, is the best of
the desperate,'' the report said.
   ``The federal government faces a slowly emerging crisis of
competence,'' concludes the study, which was conducted for the
Office of Personnel Management by the Hudson Institute, a
conservative think tank, after Congress directed that OPM look into
``the long-term work force needs of the federal government.''
   OPM Director Constance Horner, submitting the report Tuesday,
urged Congress to pay attention ``for without a strong and well
qualified civil service we endanger the democracy which it serves.''
   The report said the government's ``ability to recruit and retain
the best'' already has deteriorated.
   It said applicants score lower in civil service exams than they
did in the 1970s; the number of graduates of schools of public
administration entering federal service has dropped 25 percent
since 1979; the IRS hires accountants from the 54th percentile of
the national Certified Public Accountant exam, compared to
candidates from the 86th percentile hired by the major national
accounting firms; and at some Veterans Administration hospitals
intensive care beds are unavailable because of a shortage of nurses.
   The report cited these factors for those conditions:
   _Pay. It quoted a study which said federal workers on average
get 24 percent less than comparable workers in the private
workforce. In high-wage areas and high-ranking jobs, ``the federal
wage disadvantage is even greater,'' it said.
   _Esteem. Over the years, candidates who campaigned for office by
running against Washington have changed the public view of
government work ``into a mood of outright disdain and hostility,''
it said, and as a result ``fewer of the most talented individuals
have entered government service.''
   _``Needless aggravations.'' Among them: Limited advancement
opportunities, poor working conditions, random drug testing even
for those who are not suspected of drug use, the practice of
monitoring phone calls to check for personal calls and federal
offices that are ``drab or even seedy.''
   ``In addition, federal workers often see that unproductive
employees are retained, while those making extra efforts are not
always rewarded,'' the report said.
   ``Regardless of the attitudes they bring with them to
government, many federal workers soon come to believe that energy,
initiative and risk-taking are less valued behaviors than `going by
the book' and staying out of trouble,'' it added.
   The Hudson Institute is headed by Mitchel E. Daniels, former
political director in the Reagan White House. The chief author of
the report, William B. Johnston, was associate director of the
domestic policy staff in the Carter White House.

   Authorities arrested an armed Italian
man suspected of being a member of the Red Brigades terrorist
group, a Swiss official said Wednesday.
   The spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office, Josef
Herrmann, said Italian authorities did not request the extradition
of 28-year-old Antonio De Luca, who was arrested Sept. 22 in Basel
while on a train from Paris.
   But Italian media reports said De Luca was turned over to
Italian authorities after his arrest.
   Herrmann said De Luca was carrying a pistol and ammunition when
he was arrested.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said De Luca was living underground
in Paris and that investigators suspect he was headed to Italy in
an attempt to rebuild the terrorist gang weakened by a series of
recent arrests.

<TEXT>
   A third body was found Wednesday buried
in the rubble of a six-story condominium that collapsed and slid
down a steep hillside. Residents said the building had been unsafe
for months.
   The complex, built on six cement pillars, collapsed shortly
before 9 a.m. Tuesday in a fashionable suburb of Monterrey, killing
a man and his baby son and a woman.
   A 19-month-old girl and two women were missing.
   Luis Carlos Trevino Berchelman, assistant attorney general in
this northern Nuevo Leon state capital, said rescue crews found the
woman's body Wednesday but couldn't retrieve it because it was
under heavy concrete slabs.
   State authorities at the scene speculate that heavy rain from
Hurricane Gilbert, which ripped through the area Sept. 17,
contributed to the structure's collapse.
   ``One of the neighbors told us that six months ago they told the
architect that the building was breaking loose and it was
leaning,'' said Francisco Javier Nakashima, state judicial police
investigator.
   Asked if Gilbert's torrential rains contributed to the collapse,
Nakashima said, ``It had to have something to do with it, so all
this accelerated.''
   Residents and their relatives say the building already was
unsafe.
   ``We knew this was going to happen,'' resident Marcela Garza
told the daily Monterrey newspaper El Norte.
   ``The whole building had cracks and the frames were crooked,''
said Ms. Garza, who was away from the condominium when it fell.
   Patrick Fiehn, uncle of the 19-month-old girl trapped inside,
said in an interview that the building's support pillars had been
twisting for several months. He said an engineer hired to examine
the building just three days before the disaster told residents it
was safe.
   State and local authorities at the scene said they would not
investigate the cause of the collapse until all the victims were
found.
   Rescue teams working around the clock since the disaster dug by
hand and carried out buckets of broken concrete that had been the
building's walls and floors.
   ``We were advised to do the work by hand. The goal is to
preserve the life of those that may be inside,'' Trevino Berchelman
said.
   He said three teams of dogs that had been brought in to sniff
through the rubble, including an American group from Dallas, all
pinpointed about the same locations where the victims may be
trapped.
   But he said the heavy concrete slabs prevented rescue workers
from reaching those locations.
   Three people were rescued shortly after the structure collapsed
and did not suffer major injuries.
   A fourth survivor, Maria Eugenia Gonzalez de Rodriguez, was
dragged from the wreckage four hours after the building fell. She
was listed in stable condition Wednesday at Monterrey's Muguerza
Hospital, said Rebecca Gonzalez, a nurse on the intermediate care
ward.
   The 3-year-old building had 21 residents and one supervisor, but
only 10 people were inside the building when it fell.

   In choosing a man unpopular with
Solidarity to be prime minister, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has
signaled that authorities are not about to roll over and play dead
in talks with the opposition.
   But naming propaganda chief Mieczyslaw Rakowski to head the
government may not be as harmful to chances for achieving national
reconciliation as it initially appeared.
   The selection of Rakowski at a time when authorities have set
aside their longstanding opposition to direct talks with leaders of
the banned free trade union movement raised some eyebrows in this
capital city.
   After all, Rakowski and Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa have had
a long and bitter relationship. According to acquaintances, both
thoroughly dislike each other.
   Rakowski, then deputy prime minister, was the government's point
man in dealing with Solidarity during its 15-month legal period,
which ended in December 1981 with the imposition of martial law.
   Solidarity activists accuse the government of bad faith during
the period, while Communist authorities say Solidarity leaders were
unable to control their rank-and-file, bringing the country to the
edge of anarchy.
   The bitter feelings were not helped after martial law, when
Rakowski continued to defend the decision to crack down on
Solidarity. He went so far as to challenge Walesa on his home turf,
the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, in a dramatic televised verbal
encounter.
   Taking all this into account, promoting Rakowski will give pause
to Solidarity activists who believed that round-table talks
beginning in mid-October would quickly lead to reinstatement of the
union.
   Some people allied with the authorities have complained that the
opposition has been too quick to assume that the government's
agreement to hold talks means Solidarity already has won.
   By agreeing on the talks, authorities succeeded in ending a
Poland's most serious strike wave in seven years.
   Walesa has said publicly that recognition of Solidarity is
``very near'' and another activist told Western reporters that
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak had already conceded a
place for Solidarity in Poland's future.
   Such statements are signs of ``wishful thinking,'' on the part
of the opposition, said party journalist Daniel Passent, who added
that he doubts authorities are ready to recognize Solidarity.
   But naming Rakowski to the prime minister's post does not
automatically doom round-table talks, several political figures
said.
   ``It doesn't matter,'' said Walesa. ``It's a new situation.''
   ``Maybe he will change his opinion about Solidarity,'' said
independent parliament deputy Ryszard Bender.
   In addition, the round-table talks will be conducted by someone
other than Rakowski, who will have his hands full assembling a new
governing team and coping with Poland's disintegrating economy.
   In the three preparatory talks so far, Kiszczak has taken the
lead for the government, and participants said he has shown a good
rapport with Walesa.
   In addition, there are signs that Rakowski, who until the rise
of Solidarity was considered a leading liberal within the communist
party, would like to be seen again as a reformer who will bring
greater diversity to Polish government.
   He told the parliament after his election that he wanted to
bring people who backed reform into the government. Later,
government spokesman Jerzy Urban said members of the ``constructive
opposition'' might be invited to join the authorities.
   Recently, also, Rakowski has tempered his criticism of Walesa,
saying the Solidarity leader may have matured in recent years.
   Finally, there remained the possibility that Rakowski's tenure
in office could be brief.
   Some party observers had said before his appointment that the
next government could be transitional, pending whatever agreement
on the future government in Poland is reached by the talks with
Solidarity. And Urban said Rakowski was expected to stay until
parliamentary elections sometime next year.

   The American Civil Liberties Union, with a list
of causes running the political spectrum from the Black Panthers to
Lt. Col. Oliver North, is somewhat bewildered to find itself at the
center of the presidential campaign.
   Almost every day, Republican George Bush criticizes his
Democratic rival as ``a card-carrying member'' of the ACLU. ``My
values are your values and they are not the values of the ACLU,''
Bush told a rally on Monday.
   Even the card-carrying member, Michael Dukakis, has backed away
from the group as Bush's relentless criticism apparently strikes a
chord with voters. To the dismay of ACLU officials, the Dukakis
campaign released a list of issues on which the Massachusetts
governor differs with the group.
   Throughout its 68-year history, the group has been associated
primarily with the left, although it has come to the defense of
clients that span the ideological spectrum, from the Communist
Party to the Nazi Party, from the Ku Klux Klan to the Black
Panthers. It was founded in 1920, the outgrowth of an organization
formed to oppose U.S. involvement in World War I and to support the
rights of critics to speak out against the war.
   ``You know, we don't choose our clients,'' said Ira Glasser, the
group's executive director. ``If we are representing more people on
the left, it's because the government is prosecuting more people on
the left.''
   Among those it has jumped to the defense of recently are former
White House aides North and Lyn Nofziger. The ACLU also has
supported, in recent years, the National Rifle Association and the
National Conservative Political Action Committee.
   Most people don't associate the ACLU with those causes, of
course, and public education director Colleen O'Connor conceded
that her role ``is a relatively new mission'' of the group. She
conceded that the ACLU needs to do a better job of getting its
message out.
   ``If ever there was proof of it, it's been in the past few
months,'' she said.
   ``We don't expect Mr. Dukakis to guide his campaign by our
agenda, nor should we guide ours by his,'' she said. ``But our
concern in all this is that he not fall into the trap that Bush has
laid ... for the ACLU in suggesting that our organization is out of
the mainstream in most of our positions.''
   That, of course, is precisely the point that the Bush campaign
has tried to make. In a speech earlier this week, Republican vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle called on Dukakis to ``renounce
all their bizarre positions.''
   The positions most frequently cited are those on child
pornography, tax exemptions for churches, decriminalization of
drugs and prostitution and support for abortion and gay rights.
   For the most part, ACLU officials don't deny that the
organization holds the positions for which it is attacked.
   It opposes all censorship, maintaining that even child
pornography is protected by the First Amendment. However, officials
stress that they favor laws that preclude the exploitation of
children for pornography.
   It opposes tax exemptions for churches on the basis that they
amount to government subsidization of religion _ internally, one of
the organization's most controversial stands.
   It favors the decriminalization of drugs and prostitution as
victimless activities. And it strongly supports gay rights and a
woman's right to choose an abortion.
   ACLU officials complain, however, that conservatives have
hand-picked a few of the group's most controversial positions and
ignored the others.
   ``We take positions on hundreds of issues, and it would be real
unusual if anybody agreed with all of them,'' said Glasser. ``In
fact, I think it's fair to say that I don't agree with all of
them.''
   Glasser decried the ``basically uninformed and McCarthyite
flavor'' of the Bush attacks, while stressing that the ACLU is
non-partisan and will not take sides in the presidential race.
   It will, however, strike back at Bush. ACLU leaders are busy
readying newspaper advertisements, speeches and the group's first
television commercials. One commercial will feature Burt Lancaster
declaring: ``I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.''
   The phrase, in fact, seems to have gained a certain cachet in
ACLU circles. Ms. O'Connor said hundreds of people have written the
group in recent weeks to ask ``if they, too, can be a card-carrying
member of the ACLU.''

<HEAD>Guardian Named For Grandchildren In Disputed $350 Million Ford
Trust
^Eds: Lead expected with details from Cristina Ford alimony
hearing; time uncertain.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A snag in efforts to settle a
dispute over a $350 million trust left by auto magnate Henry Ford
II has been worked out with the appointment of a guardian to
represent his minor grandchildren.
   Attorneys for Kathleen DuRoss Ford, 48, widow of the Ford Motor
Co. heir, at first objected to another attorney's insistence of a
guardian, calling it a last-minute stall tactic.
   But they later agreed Tuesday to the appointment of retired Palm
Beach Circuit Judge Robert S. Hewitt, 71, as guardian of the four
minor grandchildren and any unborn grandchildren, residuary
beneficiaries of the trust.
   The minors will benefit after the death of Mrs. Ford, who is
entitled to receive a minimum of $1.5 million a year from the
trust, plus any income derived from investments.
   In another Ford family matter, a hearing was scheduled Wednesday
in Palm Beach County Circuit Court on a motion to dismiss Cristina
Ford's $5.4 million alimony claim. Ford divorced Cristina, his
second wife, in 1980, and she claims she has been cut off since his
death, not receiving any money from Ford's estate.
   Ford, who died Sept. 29, 1987, took control of Ford Motor Co. in
1945 from his grandfather, auto pioneer Henry Ford.
   Provisions of the confidential trust became public when Mrs.
Ford filed a lawsuit challenging the administration of the trust.
She and Ford's son, Edsel B. Ford II, had disagreed over whether
the trust should pay $1 million a year to William Donaldson, an old
friend of Henry Ford's and the third trustee, to manage the money.
   They also disagreed over which attorney would be counsel for the
trust and how the money should be invested.
   The trustees' 14 attorneys were in court Monday, ready to settle
the lawsuit and avoid the publicity a trial would generate.But the
agreement began to unravel when James Weber, attorney for Ford's
grandchildren, said a guardian was needed.
   Judge Vaughn Rudnick, who must approve any agreement, refused to
approve it without Weber's consent.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Call it the wash-and-wear wristwatch.
   It's a battery-operated, digital watch that won't work unless
it's been dipped in a glass of water, held under a faucet or soaked
some other way and its name is to the point: Water Watch.
   Why would someone want a watch that needs to be watered?
   ``Initially, we think the novelty will be the appeal,'' said
Andrew Wroblewski, whose company, Devereux Ltd., owns the worldwide
distribution rights for the watch.
   The 27-year-old Rochester resident said Wednesday wearers of the
watch should have fun with it.
   He envisions people ordering a separate glass of water at a
restaurant for their watch; hanging their watch out the window at
the car wash; or taking off their clothes and strapping on their
watch to take a shower.
   The watch, which sells for $19.95, was created by a Hong Kong
businessman and is manufactured in his factory. He has requested to
remain anonymous, Wroblewski said.
   If the watches are successful, Wroblewski said his company also
has the distribution rights to a ``water calculator'' and a ``water
clock radio.''
   The watch has three small holes on the side to take in water and
after it's been drenched it will display the time and date without
a refill for about a month depending on the humidity.
   Although the watch's package touts it as a new ``Hi-Tech''
product, the watch actually uses simple battery technology.
   The battery in the watch works much like an automobile battery
that needs to be filled with liquid in order to activate a dry
electrolyte that allows electrical current to flow through the
battery.
   Wroblewski said his company hopes to sell 500,000 watches a
month beginning in October.
   Wroblewski said he doesn't think the watch will be a fad: ``This
is not just like the hula hoop or the yo-yo. This is useful, so we
think it will find other markets.''

<HEAD>Bush Plan Leaves Private Economists Cold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private economists reacted with skepticism
Wednesday to George Bush's proposal for new tax-deferred savings
accounts for the middle class.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis was already using the proposal as
ammunition for his contention that a Bush presidency would favor
the rich. However, Republican Bush defended his plan to set up
``individual savings accounts,'' saying they would ``give taxpayers
a little nest egg.''
   Many private economists called the tax savings inconsequential
and said it was unlikely such accounts would be used by very many
Americans.
   The vice president's proposal, which he first described on
Tuesday, would allow people to deposit up to $1,000 annually in a
special savings account and defer taxes on the interest if the
money was kept in the account for a minimum of five years.
   While the interest would accumulate tax free during that time,
it would be taxed at the saver's regular tax rate once it was
withdrawn.
   That would mean that the only benefit to the taxpayer would come
from additional interest earned on money that would otherwise be
taxed immediately.
   The amount of the benefit would depend on whether the taxpayer
was being taxed at a 15 percent or 28 percent rate and how much his
investment was earning.
   Michael Boskin, a Stanford economist and a top Bush economic
adviser, said that a taxpayer being taxed at a 28 percent top rate
who put $1,000 into the special savings accounts every year for 10
years, would accumulate about $500 in tax savings at the end of 10
years. This assumes that the investments earned 10 percent annually.
   Boskin called the plan a ``modest additional proposal'' and said
it should be viewed as complementing other savings incentives such
as existing Individual Retirement Accounts and Bush's proposal for
college savings bonds, in which the income from the bonds would be
tax free if it went to college tuition.
   But other economists said the modest benefits the Bush campaign
was claiming would be even less when the savings were invested for
a shorter period of time or at lower interest rates.
   ``This is an attempt to help the middle and lower economic
classes save more money, but it is small potatoes and it is
questionable as to whether it will produce much of anything at
all,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   The economists all said that boosting Americans' low savings
rates was a worthy goal since that would free more money for
investment in areas to boost the country's productivity. But they
said this plan was unlikely to have much effect. They said a much
better approach would be to cut the federal budget deficits, which
would also free money for investment.
   ``We have implemented a slew of savings incentives in the past
several years and yet personal savings rates remain at record
lows,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, president of the Wefa Group, an
economic consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``One reason people
aren't saving more is that they feel they can't because their
living standards are already being squeezed.''
   Several economists noted that Dukakis had already seized on the
disparity between Bush's plan for middle class savers and the vice
president's proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate from the
current 33 percent maximum down to 15 percent. Dukakis said the
capital gains cut would mean an average $30,000 windfall for the
wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.
   ``George Bush plays Santa Claus to the wealthy and Ebenezer
Scrooge to the rest of us,'' Dukakis said Wednesday as he waved a
$20 bill, which he said represented the amount the average family
would save with the Bush accounts.
   Robert Reischauer, an economist at the Brookings Institution who
advises Dukakis, said that someone with a moderate income taxed at
a 15 percent rate, putting $1,000 in the Bush account per year,
would realize total tax savings of $9.44 for each $1,000 invested.
   That saving would go to $14.77 per $1,000 for someone taxed at a
28 percent tax rate. Reischauer assumes the investments would earn
8 percent interest per year.
   David Wyss, an economist at Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., economic consulting firm, called the tax savings trivial.
   ``I think he needed to come up with some kind of tax break for
the middle class to balance the freebies he wants to give the rich
with the lower capital gains tax,'' Wyss said.
   But John Makin, an economist with the conservative American
Enterprise Institute, said that the Bush proposal would be more
attractive for people willing to leave their investments alone for
longer periods.
   ``It's better than nothing but it's not going to change the
world dramatically,'' Makin said. ``And it's going to look a lot
less attractive if you are talking five years (of contributions)
and a 15 percent tax bracket.''

<HEAD>Weinberger Says Greed Led to Pentagon Bribery Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The current Pentagon bribery investigation
arises from ``plain criminal greed'' that is ``a sad aspect of
life,'' former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Wednesday.
   ``I don't believe there's anything special about the Navy, or
the Defense Department, or this situation,'' the architect of
President Reagan's defense build-up told the House Armed Services
Committee.
   Before resigning last year, Weinberger oversaw a doubling of the
Pentagon budget under Reagan and a large increase in the Pentagon's
purchase of a vast array of weapons and other items.
   The Justice Department is investigating whether private
consultants, many of them former Pentagon employees, paid bribes to
Defense Department officials for inside information about
contracts, chiefly within the Navy. Such information could be the
difference in winning multimillion-dollar contracts.
   No charges have been filed.
   Weinberger said he didn't know any of the inside details of the
investigation and was not aware it was under way until there were
news reports in June about the serving of subpoenas.
   ``That's the first I heard of it,'' he told the panel. ``Every
once in a while before that, oh, you'd come across an isolated case
here and there, but there was nothing systematic, nothing of this
scale until I read about the investigation.''
   Weinberger steadfastly defended his tenure at the Pentagon and
said he and other top Defense Department officials had worked hard
to root out corruption and fraud.
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the panel, asked
Weinberger ``Why did this happen? Is it the system? Why now?''
   ``I don't know,'' Weinberger said. ``As to why ... I suspect the
simple answer is plain criminal greed. ... It goes back to biblical
times. That's a sad aspect of life.''
   ``This so-called insider trading of information is just greed,''
he continued. ``I don't know of anything in the system ... that
requires or breeds dishonesty, but dishonesty is a sad fact of
daily existence.''
   He did endorse restrictions on the use of consultants.
   ``A lot of these (consulting) services are unnecessary,'' he
said. ``I have moral problems with these.''
   Several legislators have proposed new restrictions on the
Pentagon's use of consultants, but Weinberger declined to endorse
any specific proposals.
   He did say ``the best way'' to restrict consultants ``is to have
very strict rules and regulations with respect to reimbursement of
contractors'' if the companies hire consultants.
   The companies should be required to show that the consultants
are necessary to fulfilling the contract before the consultant fees
are reimbursed by the Pentagon, Weinberger suggested.
   Weinberger called for ``firm oversight'' by both the Pentagon
and Congress. But again, as he has in the past, he criticized
Congress for being involved too deeply in details of weapons
systems and contracts.
   He also said he had ordered sharp increases in the number of
auditors during Reagan's first term, a time when defense budgets
were rising steadily.
   ``We got a lot of criticism for over-auditing, but it seems to
me it's better than under-auditing,'' he said.
   It was the Pentagon, rather than its critics, which uncovered
many of the ``horror stories'' such as $600 toilet seat covers,
Weinberger said.
   ``All of those were uncovered by our own auditors,'' he said.
``And it needs to be remembered that we didn't pay them. We caught
them.''

   John Zaccaro Jr. got up early Wednesday,
packed up the family Oldsmobile with his father's help, and drove
away from Vermont and a cocaine dealing conviction that led to
three months under house arrest.
   The son of former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro was freed a month early, for good behavior, from
his four-month term of house arrest, a sentence that created an
uproar because Zaccaro spent it in a $1,500-a-month apartment in
Burlington.
   Zaccaro, 24, and his father, John Sr., packed up Zaccaro's
belongings at 7:30 a.m. and drove away. Their destination was not
made public, and Ferraro's office in New York said no information
would be released about their whereabouts.
   The family's telephone number in New York City is unlisted.
   Soon after Zaccaro started serving his sentence in July, the
revelation of his living conditions prompted Gov. Madeleine Kunin
to change the house arrest program so no drug dealer could
participate in it in the future.
   Zaccaro, a former Middlebury College student, was convicted of
selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover Vermont state
trooper in February 1986.
   Under house arrest, defendants pay for their own housing while
living under close state supervision. Zaccaro spent less than 30
minutes in a Vermont correctional center _ the time it took to
process his application for house arrest, authorities said.
   While under house arrest, Zaccaro worked at a youth center,
taking disadvantaged youths fishing, roller skating and swimming.
   Roxane Leopold, executive director of the King Street Area Youth
Program, said Zaccaro also distinguished himself as a cook,
preparing pasta salad, chocolate mousse and a variety of other
dishes for several social events.
   ``We miss him,'' Leopold said. ``We all wish him well.''
   Leopold said Zaccaro taught the young people he worked with a
great deal about substance abuse.
   Zaccaro was sentenced to one to five years, with all but four
months suspended. Probation officials have not determined the
length of his probation, which could last the remainder of his
original term.
   Officials said Zaccaro received 10 days off his sentence for
every 30 days he served with good behavior, reducing it by about a
month.
   Perry also said Zaccaro had performed 530 hours of community
service, 230 hours more than required in Judge Francis McCaffrey's
sentence.

   Here are brief sketches of the
astronauts who will fly aboard the space shuttle Discovery.
   NAVY CAPT. FREDERICK H. HAUCK, who has flown on two previous
shuttles since becoming an astronaut 10 years ago, will be
commanding the first shuttle to fly since the Challenger blew up
little more than a minute after it left the launchpad Jan. 28, 1986.
   Hauck, 47, said he has had plenty of time to dwell on Challenger
and won't be concentrating on that when he lifts off.
   ``There's no doubt I'll be looking at the screen, that when it
says 73 seconds and it's counting upwards, I'll know we've passed
that particular milestone. But it's not like I'm worried about
it,'' he said in a recent interview.
   The former Navy test pilot, who flew 114 combat and combat
support missions in Southeast Asia, piloted the Challenger in June
1983 and commanded Discovery in November 1984 when the crew made
the first space salvage mission in history, retrieving two disabled
satellites.
   Hauck grew up in Winchester, Mass., and Washington, D.C. He
received a bachelor's degree from Tufts University and a master's
in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   His wife, Dolly, and 25-year-old daughter, Whitney Hauck Wood,
planned to be at the launch, he said, but his 23-year-old son,
Stephen, a Navy officer, is stationed on a ship that was sent to
the Persian Gulf.

<TEXT>
   AIR FORCE COL. RICHARD O. COVEY, an astronaut for nearly 10
years, will pilot the shuttle on which he logged more than 170
hours in space on a previous flight.
   The 42-year-old former Air Force fighter and test pilot guided
Discovery on an August 1985 mission and will be thinking about the
Challenger astronauts when he lifts off on his new mission.
   ``I'll also be knowing that they would be pleased that we have
gotten back to the point where we are going to fly again.''
   His wife, Kathleen, and daughters Sarah, 14, and Amy, 12 will
attend the launch.
   Covey was born in Fayetteville, Ark., and grew up in Fort Walton
Beach, Fla. His late father was an Air Force lieutenant colonel.
   He earned a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy in
1968 and a master's in aeronautics and astronautics from Purdue
University a year later.
   As an Air Force pilot, Covey flew 339 combat missions during two
tours in southeast Asia. He has flown more than 4,000 hours in more
than 25 different types of aircraft.

   MARINE LT. COL. DAVID C. HILMERS, an astronaut since 1980 and
veteran of one previous shuttle flight, will be a mission
specialist aboard Discovery.
   Hilmers' first space flight was in October 1985 _ the maiden
voyage of the orbiter Atlantis, on which he was a mission
specialist.
   On Discovery, he will help deploy a $100 million communications
satellite.
   Hilmers grew up in DeWitt, Iowa, and graduated with a bachelor's
degree in mathematics, summa cum laude, from Cornell College in
1972. He earned a master's degree in electrical engineering in 1977
and the degree of electrical engineer from the U.S. Naval
Postgraduate School in 1978.
   Hilmers said that like the other astronauts, he will be thinking
of their Challenger crew members.
   But, he added, ``I think that when it gets right down to the
last couple of minutes, that we're going to be looking up at the
sky and not behind us.''
   Hilmers and his wife, Lynn, have two sons, Matthew, 13, and
Daniel, 9.

   GEORGE ``PINKY'' NELSON is the only one of Discovery's five-man
crew who has walked in space.
   Nelson, 38, logged nine hours of space-walking on his first
flight, aboard Challenger in April 1984. His second mission, on
Columbia, began 16 days before the Challenger tragedy.
   On this launch, there are no plans for Nelson to walk in space,
unless something goes wrong in deploying a $100 million
communications satellite.
   He is again a mission specialist and this time has the duty of
blowing off an escape hatch and deploying a new escape pole for the
five men if an emergency occurs.
   ``On the one point, you have to be doubly focused on what's
happening. On the other hand you just have to be soaking in this
amazing experience,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Nelson, an astronomer, is the only one on the five-man crew
without a military background. He is the son of a high school
science teacher, grew up in Willmar, Minn., and earned a bachelor's
degree in physics from Harvey Mudd College in 1972 and a master's
and doctorate in astronomy from the University of Washington in
1974 and 1978.
   His wife, Susan, and daughters, Aimee Tess, 16, and Marti Ann,
13, will be present for the liftoff.

   JOHN M. ``Mike'' LOUNGE, who first flew into space on Discovery
in August 1985, will again be a mission specialist on NASA's first
flight in 2{ years.
   This time aboard Discovery, Lounge, 38, a former Navy aviator,
is the lead astronaut in charge of deploying the $100 million
communications satellite.
   His other flight, which launched Aug. 27, 1985, is described by
NASA as its most successful shuttle mission so far, with astronauts
deploying three satellites and repairing an ailing satellite.
   Lounge, of Burlington, Colo., said the Challenger tragedy will
add to the anxiety astronauts always feel during the first few
moments after launch, Lounge said. But, he said, once the
spacecraft gets into space ``and it gets real quiet, my heartbeat
will probably go down quite a bit.''
   Lounge, a Colorado native, received a B.S. degree in physics and
mathematics from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1969 and a master's in
astrogeophysics from the University of Colorado.
   He completed a nine-month cruise in Southeast Asia aboard the
USS Enterprise and participated in 99 combat missions. He currently
is a member of the Texas Air National Guard and flies with his unit
at least once a week.
   He was selected as an astronaut in 1980.
   His family, including, his children Shannon, 17, Kenneth, 7, and
Kathy, 4, plan to be there for the liftoff.

   The Voice of America, the U.S. government's

Wednesday.
   Charles Z. Wick, head of the U.S. Information Agency that runs

Washington.
   Wick's partner in joint U.S.-Soviet information talks, Valentin

said. Falin is head of the semi-official Soviet news agency Novosti.
   For years, the Kremlin lambasted VOA as a ``hostile voice'' and
tried to jam its broadcasts into the Soviet Union. Although the
Soviets have stopped jamming VOA, they continue to jam two other
U.S.-government funded radio stations, Radio Liberty, which
broadcasts to the Soviet Union, and Radio Free Europe, which
broadcasts to Eastern Europe.

   An explosion on Wednesday
seriously injured a man outside government offices in the
mixed-race township of Bonteheuwel, and police said the victim was
placed under guard.
   Police said it was possible the man was carrying the bomb when
it exploded.
   The man suffered serious arm and leg injuries and was found
lying outside the building after the 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) blast,
which shattered windows and tore off roof tiles on the building
housing municipal offices, police said.
   Residents of Strand, about 25 miles southeast of Cape Town, said
they heard a second explosion outside municipal offices in that
city shortly after the blast in Bonteheuwel.
   There have been more than 50 bombings in South Africa this year
and police have blamed most of them on the outlawed African

<HEAD>US to Import Chinese Breeding Swine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States has reached a ``historic
agreement to import Chinese breeding swine'' in hopes of upgrading
American pork supplies, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said the contract involves
USDA's Agricultural Service, China's ministry of agriculture, and
the Chinese National Animal Breeding Stock Import and Export Corp.
   The imports will include 144 pigs of the Meishan, Ming and
Fengjing breeds, he said. The animals will be used in research
studies under a cooperative agreement with the USDA's meat animal
research laboratory at Clay Center, Neb., the University of
Illinois, and Iowa State University.
   Myers, a hog farmer from Missouri, said he talked about the
potential agreement during his June 1987 visit to China. He said
China has about 100 breeds of swine that represent a ``unique
reservoir of unexplored germplasm'' that could offer potential
benefits for the U.S. industry.
   ``This unexploited source ... could prove to be very valuable to
the U.S. research programs on resistance to diseases, parasites and
improvement of some production traits,'' he said. ``China has a
long history in the domestication of pigs that can be traced back
for at least 6,000 years.''
   According to USDA reports, China also is the world's largest hog
producer. At the end of 1983, for example, China had an inventory
of 298.5 million hogs, compared with 55.8 million for the United
States at that time.
   A department spokeswoman, Sandy Miller Hays, said she did not
know and could not find out immediately how much the pigs cost the
United States or whether there might be other terms involved.
   A goal of the import program is to cross the Chinese breeds with
U.S. breeds to increase litter size while maintaining the quality
and lean yield of pork. The breeds being imported have three to
four more pigs per litter than the average U.S. breed.
   The animals will be imported in late March 1989 after spending
60 days in quarantine in China and meeting other health
requirements. They will be quarantined again for 120 days at USDA's
animal import center in Fleming Key, Fla., before being released
for research.
   Roger J. Gerrits of the department's Agricultural Research
Service said scientists hope to conduct at least five years of
research to evaluate the animals and determine if they should be
released for use by the U.S. swine industry.
   Gerrits said that U.S. swine geneticists recognized the
potential value of Chinese swine more than 10 years ago, but
``satisfactory health and quarantine requirements were not
completed'' until last year.
   ``The three breeds selected for the research studies are highly
prolific,'' he said. ``U.S. geneticists estimate it would take at
least 30 generations of conventional selection to increase the
litter size of the average U.S. swine breed to the level routinely
produced by these Chinese breeds.''
   Each university and the USDA agency will conduct its own
research program, but projects at each will be coordinated. Gerrits
said provisions also have been made for the exchange and sharing of
germplasm _ semen and other genetic material _ in case of a disease
outbreak or other unexpected losses.

   Jazz drummer J.C. Heard, who performed
with many of the world's best-known jazz musicians, has died. He
was 71.
   Bonnie Niebel, a spokeswoman for William Beaumont Hospital, said
Heard died there Tuesday night. She said she did not know the cause.
   Heard had been scheduled to appear Wednesday night in concert
with his friend, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Heard's agent, Jim
Fleming of Ann Arbor, said attempts were being made to see that the
concert Wednesday night and one Thursday go on.
   Heard performs on two current albums, ``Some of This, Some of
That'' and oen on which he accompanied pianist Mark ``Mr. B'' Braun.
   ``He was the consummate professional,'' Ron Brooks, a bass
player and owner of The Bird of Paradise in Ann Arbor, where Heard
frequently played, said Wednesday. ``He was a great model for young
musicians.''
   Brooks said Heard's wife was visiting friends in Europe when
Heard was stricken. The Heards had been living in Southfield.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Lange Says He Can't Visit White House, But `Hoods' Can</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister David Lange of New Zealand said
Wednesday that strained relations between his government and the
United States have kept him from visiting the White House even
though ``all sorts of hoods'' go there.
   Lange, in the United States for a speech to the U.N. General
Assembly, told ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' the New Zealand
government was firm in its refusal to allow U.S. nuclear-armed
ships to visit ports in his country.
   The ban led the United States to end its alliance with New
Zealand.
   ``If that means you take your Army and Air Force and Navy away,
that's bad; we regret it,'' Lange said. ``But the price of being
defeated by a nuclear devastation is something we're not prepared
to pay.''
   He was asked what that meant for relations between the two
countries.
   ``It means that I don't sort of get taken to the White House,''
Lange said. ``I've been to Disneyland four times, New York about
three times in the last four years, and I've never been to the
White House.
   ``And all sorts of hoods have been to the White House in that
time,'' he said, without elaborating.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment when
asked about the remark.
   ``But it's an easy, practical relationship,'' Lange said. ``We
get along well with the United States. We look at the world through
your news cameras.''

<HEAD>Reagan Not Worried About Who Wins Nobel Peace Prize, But Aides
Hoping</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Nobel Prize Bjt</HEAD>

   President Reagan laughed when he was asked
about prospects for winning the Nobel Peace Prize, but aides in the
White House had their fingers crossed in hopes Thursday's award
will cement the president's place in history as a peacemaker.
   ``I'm superstitious _ since one hand is crossed the other one
can't be, because it would cancel the other out,'' quipped Nancy
Reagan's spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev have been
mentioned as top contenders for the $390,000 prize because of their
efforts in reaching the first superpower treaty banning an entire
class of nuclear weapons. According to the Nobel committee in Oslo,
which will announce the winner Thursday, 97 individuals and
organizations were candidates for the peace prize this year.
   The first lady long has been rumored to be the White House
resident most interested in seeing her husband crown his eight-year
presidency with one of the world's most prestigious awards.
   But Mrs. Crispen pooh-poohed the idea that Mrs. Reagan was
anxious for her husband to receive the golden medal, saying the
first lady's ``never said a word about it.'' And even if such an
honor didn't come his way, the couple wouldn't be disappointed,
Mrs. Crispen predicted.
   ``Going through elections and such, they're always set for
things to go one way or another. They are very realistic about
winning and losing,'' she said.
   When reporters queried Reagan about his prospects last week
during a visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
the president and his visitor broke out in big smiles and laughed.
   While Reagan said nothing, Shevardnadze quipped that it might be
``a good possibility'' that his Soviet boss and Reagan might meet
once again if they were to go to Oslo to receive the award.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said no one in the
executive mansion has had any advance information on the
announcement.
   ``No one knows what will happen, it's not the sort of thing you
can anticipate, but it would be wonderful for the president if he
won,'' Fitzwater said.
   If Reagan were to win, he'd be the third U.S. president to do so.
   President Theodore Roosevelt was the first American to win the
award, receiving it in 1906 for his diplomacy in ending the
conflict between Russia and Japan.
   President Woodrow Wilson was granted the medallion for his
peacemaking efforts involving the League of Nations after World War
I.
   Any chief executive is reminded of the benchmark set by earlier
presidents, since Roosevelt's medal is on display across the hall
from the Oval Office in the Roosevelt Room.
   The 2{-inch golden medallion, encased in a 14-inch high
plexiglass cube, shimmers in a special spotlight on the mantel for
all to see.
   Wilson's medal is now in the possession of the Library of
Congress and will be placed on display at the Woodrow Wilson House
in November and December in observance of Armistice Day.
   Wilson's prize was bestowed in 1920 after he failed to win U.S.
support for his beloved League of Nations, ``and he felt very
vindicated by the peace prize,'' said Patricia Sullivan, the
director of the museum at the Wilson House.
   The Washington mansion was where the gravely ill president spent
his last days in virtual seclusion.
   Some think Reagan doesn't deserve the prize because of his
support for the Nicaraguan Contras in their war against the
Sandinista government.
   And Roosevelt, in his time, was viewed by many as the antithesis
of the peacemaker.
   ``The prize seems somewhat anomalous, inasmuch as it was awarded
to an outspoken advocate of armed force and a scourge of
pacifism,'' wrote John Milton Cooper Jr. in his study of Roosevelt
and Wilson, ``The Warrior and the Priest.''
   ``Yet it was not anomalous. The policies Roosevelt pursued in
the Far East and Europe were aimed at averting or containing
conflicts among the great powers and promoting international
stability. Behind both the appearance and the reality of his public
stances, the president lead an almost secret life as a sensitive,
subtle diplomat,'' Cooper said.

<HEAD>New Interest Shown In Use Of Plant To Make Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Research into the growing and use of kenaf, a
fibrous plant that can be used to make paper, is getting more
attention after a decade on the back burner, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   Howard E. Waterworth, coordinator of kenaf research for USDA's
Agricultural Research Service, said $300,000 is being invested this
year in kenaf studies through agency laboratories in Lane, Okla.,
and Weslaco, Texas. Another $300,000 is scheduled for 1989.
   ``Industry trials, including test runs by several U.S.
newspapers, indicate that pulp from kenaf makes newsprint paper
that is as sturdy as woodpulp paper but generally is brighter,
consumes less ink and has less ink ruboff,'' Waterworth said.
   Kenaf can be grown in southern U.S. areas such as Texas,
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and California, he said. The plants
grow 15 to 18 feet in height in less than five months and can grow
to around 22 feet. An acre yields 7 to 10 tons of dry fiber.
   The Peoria (Ill.) Journal-Star in 1977 was the first newspaper
to make a press run on kenaf newsprint. At least eight other
newspapers have had similar tests, including the most recent in
July 1987 at the Bakerfield Californian.
   Agency research on kenaf was suspended in 1978 when supplies of
paper pulp were plentiful and prices were down, Waterworth said.
   The USDA has spent about $900,000 to support commercial
development of kenaf through private industry since 1986, and the
new funds for research are expected ``to give additional support''
to that enterprise, he said.

<HEAD>Jury Convicts Third Defendant in Camarena Killing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Mexican drug trafficker was found guilty
Wednesday of aiding and abetting the 1985 torture murder of a U.S.
drug agent and his pilot. He was the third man convicted in the
case, which strained U.S.-Mexican relations.
   Jesus Felix Gutierrez, 38, was found guilty by a federal jury of
helping Mexican drug baron Rafael Caro Quintero escape to Costa
Rica after the brutal 1985 murder of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala
Avelar.
   Felix's attorney had contended there was insufficent evidence to
convict the former Los Angeles seafood store owner and suggested
the government altered evidence.
   The key evidence against Felix was the testimony of a government
informant who said he heard the defendant discuss his role in
arranging Caro's escape. Prosecutors also showed jurors entries on
Felix's passport indicating he had preceded Caro to Costa Rica and
left after Caro arrived.
   Earlier, jurors convicted Renee Verdugo Uruidez, 36, and Raul
Lopez Alvarez, 28, of conspiring and participating in the
kidnap-murders of Camarena and Zavala.
   Verdugo, who was said to be Caro's chief lieutenant in a
multimillion-dollar marijuana smuggling ring, and Lopez, a former
member of the Mexican state police, face possible life imprisonment.
   Lopez is to be sentenced Oct. 24, and Verdugo's sentencing is
set for Oct. 26.
   Felix, who is serving time on a cocaine trafficking conviction,
faces a possible maximum of 10 years in prison.
   The battered bodies of Camarena and his pilot were found buried
at a remote ranch outside Guadalajara on March 5, 1985. Camarena
had been kidnapped outside the U.S. consulate in Guadalajara on
Feb. 7, 1985.
   Evidence showed the agent and pilot were tortured with red-hot
metal pipes and beaten so severely that Camarena's skull was
crushed.
   Prosecutors theorized the killings were retribution for DEA
raids on Caro's marijuana plantations.
   Attorneys for the three defendants said they were scapegoats
used by the Mexican and American governments to close an
embarrassing, internationally sensitive case.
   Nine men were indicted in Los Angeles but only three were tried
here. One defendant died. Four, including Caro, were tried in
Mexico on narcotics and murder charges.
   Caro, 37, and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo,63, were convicted last
week in Mexico on narcotics and weapons charges. Caro was sentenced
to 34 years and Fonseca 11 years. Verdicts have not yet been
reached on some of the Mexican charges including the murder charges.

<HEAD>FRA Says Railroad Hired Unqualified Engineers, Union Sabotaged
Trains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike-plagued New England freight rail line
hired ``plainly unqualified'' replacement engineers while strikers
engaged in a ``campaign of intimidation'' and sabotage, the Federal
Railroad Administration said Wednesday.
   The 44-page report harshly criticized both management and labor
at Guilford Transportation Industries, where workers went on strike
Nov. 12, 1987, following an accident at a Lawrence, Mass., freight
yard that killed a conductor. Strikers returned to work this summer
after a federal arbitration board ruled in their favor.
   ``Both management and those opposing management's position have
demonstrated their willingness to compromise both work place and
public safety when their economic interests are at stake,'' the FRA
report said.
   Labor and management were willing ``to use the safety issue as
leverage to achieve (their) objectives.''
   The agency disagreed with the union's contentions that there
were safety problems before the strike. But the report said
engineers hired to replace striking workers were recruited ``from
any available source ... in disregard of sound safety practice and
simple common sense.''
   ``The result was an engineer force that resembled a patchwork
quilt, with engineers ranging from qualified to plainly
unqualified. The company was willing to compromise public safety to
achieve its economic objective.''
   The union, meanwhile, ``waged what amounted to a campaign of
intimidation against the carrier and its replacement employees,''
the report said.
   The FRA cited more than 100 incidents of slashed air brake hoses
plus derailments caused by objects placed on Guilford tracks. Bear
traps were once set where replacement employees were expected to
walk the next shift.
   ``Whatever their economic differences may be, it is essential
that both sides keep safety separate from their ongoing economic
disputes and make a common commitment to observe sound safety
practices even when they are in conflict with the parties
short-term economic objectives,'' the FRA said.
   Michael Maloof, chairman of the United Transportation Union,
said he had not seen the FRA report, but denounced it and called
FRA Administrator John Reilly ``anti-union.''
   Guilford Vice President Colin Pease also lambasted the report,
saying it ``politicizes the process.''
   ``At no time did this railroad put employees to work who were
unqualified. When the strike began, we dramatically curtailed our
service because we did not have sufficient employees,'' Pease said.
``There is no issue more important to the management of this
railroad than safety.''
   The FRA concluded that working conditions were safe when the
union went on strike last year in connection with safety issues.
That conclusion differs sharply from a federal arbitration board
ruling in June that said the strike was legitimate because of
unsafe rail conditions.
   The company was ordered to reinstate the workers and pay
millions in back pay. Guilford officials are appealing that
decision, but have rehired the workers.
   In February, the FRA announced $734,900 in fines against
Guilford for a variety of safety violations.

<HEAD>Sprinkel Says Economic Downturn To Ease Inflation, Stem Interest
Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president's chief economic adviser said
Wednesday that slowing economic growth in the second half of the
year should ease inflationary pressures and help bring down
interest rates.
   Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said he expected overall economic growth would drop below
3 percent in the second half of 1988.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at
an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first six months of the year.
Sprinkel said growth could slow to 2.8 percent in the final six
months and still be enough to meet the administration's target of 3
percent growth for all of 1988, when measured from the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   Sprinkel said the slower growth should help ease fears that the
country was about to embark on a renewed inflationary spiral
triggered by heavy demand bumping up against tight labor markets
and high factory operating rates.
   This slowdown should help lower interest rates, Sprinkel said.
   ``My own view is ... that we can expect some relief on interest
rates in the period ahead,'' he said.
   Sprinkel said the slowdown has caused the unemployment rate to
rise slightly in the past two months, although it still remained
near 14-year lows. In August, the jobless rate was 5.6 percent, up
from 5.3 percent in June.
   Sprinkel predicted the downward trend should resume, helping to
push the jobless rate toward 5 percent.
   Sprinkel's comments came in a briefing to reporters on the
70-month expansion since the 1981-82 recession, a recovery which
Sprinkel credited to the pro-growth economic policies pursued by
President Reagan.
   ``The present record-breaking expansion has raised living
standards, reduced poverty, reduced inflation and created nearly 18
million new jobs, most of them good jobs at good rates of pay,''
Sprinkel said.

   Pride, not profit, inspires Conrad
Industries Inc. to embroider the patches that adorn the space suits
of the astronauts, the company's president says.
   Conrad has embroidered the patch for Discovery, designed in
tribute to the seven Challenger astronauts, as it has for every
manned mission since Apollo 12, the second moon landing.
   The Discovery patch shows a stylized shuttle rising into the the
sky on a plume of fire and smoke and streaking through a red,
V-like vector. A multi-rayed sun creeps over the horizon and the
Big Dipper hangs in the sky.
   NASA said the sunrise represents a new beginning; the launch, a
safe mission; and the red vector, the symbol of aeronautics, the
traditional strength of the space agency.
   The seven stars of the dipper symbolize Challenger astronauts.
   The patch has five colors, but such emblems can have up to 19,
compared with three colors in a typical commercial or military
design, said company president Bernhard Conrad.
   ``We sometimes spend a dollar and charge a dime. But we do it
for the prestige, the satisfaction and the chance to sell to
collectors,'' he said, adding that the emblems represent only a
small part of its $11 million annual volume.

   Michael Dukakis waved a $20 bill in the air Wednesday and
ridiculed George Bush's plan for a middle-class tax break as worthy
of Ebenezer Scrooge. The vice president said his idea would give
average Americans a chance at ``a little nest egg.''
   An aggressive Dukakis also accused the Reagan administration of
permitting a ``Hall of Shame'' to spring up over the last seven
years, citing ``dozens and dozens of top administration officials
who broke the law or violated the public trust.'' He said he would
crack down on lobbying by officials who leave their government
posts.
   Bush tried to turn the tables on his rival, criticizing the
Democrat's plan to collect billion of dollars in delinquent taxes
and to offer students guaranteed loans to be repaid through a
lifetime of payroll deductions.
   ``We do not need to put the IRS on your tail for the rest of
your life,'' he said.
   ``You're going to win by a landslide, I know it,'' country
singer Loretta Lynn told the vice president as the campaign's bus
caravan rolled through rural Illinois. Said Barbara Bush, ``You and
I and his mother are the only three who think that's true.''
   Most polls make the race a tight one, with a little less than
six weeks remaining to judgment day.
   Vice presidential candidates Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen went
through their daily campaign paces as they pointed toward next
week's nationally televised debate in Omaha, Neb.
   Dukakis took time out from his attacks on Bush to meet privately
and pose for pictures with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, in this country for the United Nations General
Assembly meeting. The Soviet diplomat, who met with Bush last week,
said he wasn't playing favorites in the presidential camopaign.
``It's up to the American people to elect a president,'' he said
through an interpreter.
   Earlier, Dukakis stepped up his attack on Bush's new plan for
tax-deferred savings accounts as he campaigned in Western
Pennsylvania.
   Waving a $20 bill to represent the amount the average family
would save in a year, he declared, ``George Bush plays Santa Claus
to the wealthy and Ebenezer Scrooge to the rest of us.'' That was a
reference to Bush's call for a cut in the capital gains tax, a move
that Dukakis says would give huge benefits to the rich.
   Bush campaigned the old fashioned way through central Illinois,
leading a eight-bus caravan through a string of small towns on an
early autumn day. He mixed political offense with defense along his
150-mile route.
   He said his proposal for tax-deferred savings account was a move
designed to ``give taxpayers a little nest egg.'' Under the plan,
low- or middle-income Americans could invest up to $1,000 a year in
a long-term savings account and defer paying taxes on the interest.
Only those earning under $50,000 would qualify for the full
benefit, and one Bush adviser traveling with the vice president
said as the plan was unveiled Tuesday that the annual savings would
be under $20 per individual.
   The vice president sought to turn the tables with an attack on
Dukakis' plan to assure college financing for all. ``Under his
approach, the government would give you a loan, then take a bit out
of your paycheck for the next 40 years,'' Bush said.
   At a later stop as he wended his way north on U.S. Highway 51,
he criticized Dukakis for wanting to ``squeeze another $35 billion
bucks out of the taxpayers' pockets. He said the IRS would have to
double its work force of 200,000 to meet Dukakis' goal.
   An aide to Dukakis later said Bush was misrepresenting the
facts. The aide, Leslie Dach, said Dukakis' plan to collect unpaid
taxes would require a growth of 6 percent a year in the number of
IRS agents. He said the student loan program would be government
guaranteed, but the money would come from banks, not the Treasury.
   Dukakis proposes permitting any student, regardless of family
income, to receive a federally guaranteed student loan. The money
would be repaid over a lifetime through payroll deductions. He also
says he wants the government to move aggressively against tax
cheats before he will listen to any talk of possibly raising taxes.
   The subject for Dukakis' first stop of the day was government
ethics, and he sought to tie Bush to the administration's record.
   ``George Bush may be satisfied with the revolving door between
the administration and private lobbying firms where self-service
replaces public service and dishonest consultants are ripping off
the Pentagon,'' Dukakis said. ``I say we can do better.''
   He said he would sign an executive order the day he takes office
barring several hundred high officials from lobbying the government
after they leave their posts. The order would remain in effect for
the duration of a Dukakis administration.
   ``High government office is a public trust, not a training camp
for foreign lobbyists or a vehicle for private gain,'' he said.
   Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen visited Truman High School in
Independence, Mo., and likened himself to the man who moved into
the Oval Office after Franklin Roosevelt's death. ``Like Harry
Truman, I'm ready,'' he said. ``Ready to run and serve with Mike
Dukakis.''
   Bentsen left the impression that he doesn't think his
41-year-old rival is up to the presidency.
   ``I'll tell you, if they were elected, I'd pray for the good
health of George Bush every night,'' the 67-year-old Texas senator
said.
   Quayle campaigned in Bentsen's home state of Texas, helping
raise funds for Republican Rep. Beau Bolter, who is challenging
Bentsen's bid for a new Senate term. He said Dukakis has close ties
to an organization that advocates deep cuts in defense and has as
supporters ``the extreme left wing of the Democratic party.''

<HEAD>Report Offers Help To State Accountability Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Department on Wednesday issued a
report designed to aid governors, state legislators and educational
committees on how best to measure performance of America's public
schools.
   ``There's not much point in trying to improve schools unless you
can measure whether the efforts are working,'' Chester E. Finn,
Jr., assistant secretary of the Office of Educational Research and
Improvement (OERI) said in a statement.
   ``We're long past the days when good intentions and lots of
activity were acceptable signs of movement. Now policy-makers want
_ and the public deserves _ clear evidence of actual
accomplishment,'' Finn continued.
   The 66-page report, entitled ``Creating Responsible and
Responsive Accountability Systems: Report of the OERI State
Accountability Study Group,'' is based on an in-depth examination
of 10 states' systems and a survey of 50 states and the District of
Columbia.
   The study group, composed of 27 members from 10 states and five
national organizations, was convened last year to examine the trend
in state monitoring of the results of education practices.
   The report details review systems in 50 states and the District
of Columbia and is intended to help states produce information that
is ``reliable, fair and useful for improving schools.''
   ``I think states, without exception, have the constitutional
responsibility for education,'' Finn told a press conference. ``And
I believe that states have a responsibility that goes with that to
know how their schools are doing.
   ``They need to know that even if their localities don't want to
know that.'' he added.
   ``The State has an obligation to see that the public is
informed, the governor is informed, the legislature is informed and
the taxpayer is informed,'' said Finn adding that local communities
should not have the option of concealing such information from the
public.
   ``I think it is also desirable to have this information
available on the district level so that the residents of district A
can see if their kids and their tax dollars are being well
served,'' Finn noted.
   In California, the report noted that the state education
department sends a yearly report card to every school, complete
with an acheivement ranking.
   In South Carolina, districts displaying student achievement
gains may receive monetary awards and bonuses for gains in student
and teacher attendance. Failing school districts may be subject to
withholding of funds or state intervention, the report said.
   The document also attempted to address educators' concerns that
some evaluation techniques may make unfair comparisons, encourage
over testing or narrow their focus by using only standardized tests
results.
   The report's recommendations include using a variety of
indicators to measure performance; make performance data public;
consider programs, rewards and incentives to encourage high
performance, and offer assistance to low performing districts
before considering state intervention.

   The Senate on Wednesday wished the crew of the
space shuttle Discovery ``Godspeed, good luck and a safe journey
home'' on their mission scheduled to take off Thursday morning.
   In a resolution introduced by the body's leadership and passed
by voice vote, the Senate congratulated the men and women of the
U.S. space program for the work they had done on the mission and
wished good luck to shuttle commander Rick Hauck and rest of the
Discovery crew.
   The measure was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. Co-sponsors
included former astronaut, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the first
American to orbit the Earth, and Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, first
congressional observer to fly in space.
   The flight will be the first since the explosion of the shuttle
Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Dole said that since the Challenger crash, ``Our space program
has been under intense scrutiny. Tomorrow will be no different. The
successful launch of the Discovery will be the beginning of a new
era in America's exploration in space.''

<HEAD>New Premier Grants Interviews, Delivers Awards In Busy First Full
Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski
consulted political leaders, handed out awards and gave interviews
Wednesday on a busy first full day on the job.
   Rakowski announced on the evening television news he would meet
Thursday with officials of the government-sanctioned trade union
alliance OPZZ, which had demanded the resignation of the previous
government.
   He told a Polish television interviewer he would also meet with
``other people. But you'll learn about that tomorrow.''
   The activities of Rakowski, the former party propaganda chief,
dominated the report of the state-run news agency PAP, and the TV
news devoted 10 minutes of its half-hour program to him.
   Parliament on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved Rakowski, 61, a
hard-line opponent of the banned trade union Solidarity, as
Poland's ninth prime minister since World War II.
   The government led by Zbigniew Messner resigned Sept. 19
following fierce criticism of its failure to achieve economic
reform.
   Rakowski met with the leaders of the communist-allied Peasants'
Party and the Democratic Party to start building a new Cabinet.
   In his acceptance speech to Parliament, Rakowski had asked for
two weeks to form a government of people with ``reformist
attitudes'' to broaden the base of the communist-dominated
government.
   The veteran party journalist received the Soviet Ambassador
Vladimir Brovikov and departing Italian Ambassador Paolo Galli, PAP
said.
   Rakowski also presented awards for achievements in the housing
industry, saying his government's success would depend on whether
it could improve the housing situation, PAP said.
   Poles can wait up to 30 years to obtain an apartment, and the
housing shortage is a major source of public discontent.
   As prime minister, Rakowski faces tremendous economic
challenges. Authorities concede that confidence in the government
has eroded significantly due to the failure of the economic reform
to produce results.
   Inflation is running at 60 percent annually, consumer goods are
in short supply and workers are restless after staging two waves of
punishing strikes in the worst labor strife in seven years.
   The turmoil ended Sept. 3 when the authorities promised
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa that talks would be held to consider
the union's future.
   Solidarity, which was the Soviet bloc's only recognized
independent trade movement, was suppressed when Poland declared
martial law in 1981 and banned the following year.

   A girl with AIDS should be separated from
classmates, but a judge went too far in ordering that she sit in a
glass booth, an attorney for the 7-year-old told a federal appeals
panel Wednesday.
   Eliana Martinez could sit out of reach from classmates at a
kidney-shaped table, said Steve Hanlon, the lawyer hired by the
girl's adoptive mother, Rosa Martinez. He said such a plan would
fulfill guidelines issued by the federal Centers for Disease
Control.
   Ms. Martines contends it would be detrimental to her daughter's
development to sit in a ``glass cage.'' But the 11th U.S. Court of
Appeals judges expressed concerns at the hearing about whether the
alternative was to expose the other children in the special
education classroom to the incurable disease.
   The three-judge panel gave no indication when it would rule.
   ``It's a tough, tough case,'' Tom Gonzalez, an attorney for the
Hillsborough County School Board, said. He said no case had
previously arisen in U.S. courts of a retarded, incontinent child
with AIDS.
   The CDC has concluded children exposed to AIDS do not generally
pose a risk to their classmates, but some unconvinced parents are
still raising objections.
   In South Roxana, Ill., school officials are bracing for protests
Thursday as 8-year-old Jason Robertson entrs second grade. Jason's
family left the St. Louis suburb of Granite City last month, saying
they'd been harassed for their efforts to enroll him in regular
classes there.
   In August, a federal judge in Tampa ruled Eliana could go to
school, but she had to stay inside a glass or Plexiglas enclosure
until she was toilet trained and stopped sucking her fingers.
   The school board wanted the child to be taught at home but
agreed to the partition and built it.
   ``We believe great harm would occur to that child if she went
into that enclosure,'' Hanlon told the appellate panel.
   Citing medical testimony from the trial, he said the risk of
transmitting the fatal disease to other children was a ``remote,
theoretical potential.'' That testimony referred to exposure to the
AIDS virus through tears, saliva and urine.
   Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance noted that the trial judge's order
mentioned that Eliana had a condition of mouth sores and cracked
lips called oral thrush, but didn't say what risk it poses.
   ``I see a significant risk, which I can't erase from my mind,''
said Vance. He said handicapped children are known to bite each
other, which he said could spread AIDS if the infected child had a
trace of blood in the mouth.
   To put a child in such a situation ``may be sentencing those
children to death. That evidence a judge is not going to treat
lightly,'' he said.
   Hanlon said Eliana's doctors found no evidence of blood in the
mouth, but if bleeding developed, Eliana would be held out of class.
   Doctors believe Eliana was infected by blood transfusions
following her premature birth in Puerto Rico. Mrs. Martinez, a
licensed practical nurse, adopted her as an infant after hearing a
radio appeal for a homeless child.
   Mrs. Martinez attended the hearing and afterward was joined by
Eliana on the courthouse steps.
   ``Eliana will not go into that glass enclosure,'' Mrs. Martinez
said. ``She would not be happy there. She's not going; that's it. I
want her in a regular classroom with trainable, mentally
handicapped children just like her. I think the school board has
stalled enough.''

   The Agency for International Development said the funds will be
used in part to restore power, water and sewage services which were

   Roofing materials, medical supplies, seeds and farming tools
also will be purchased.
   On Sept. 12, Hurricane Gilbert wrecked tens of thousands of

   About 2,000 VIPs _ including the
officials who investigated the Challenger disaster and those
assigned to keep an eye on NASA as a result _ are expected to be on
hand Thursday to watch Discovery lift off.
   Also in the crowd at a special viewing site on the NASA Causeway
6{ miles from the launchpad will be relatives of two of the seven
astronauts who were killed when Challenger exploded 32 months ago _
Scott Smith, son of pilot Michael Smith, and Claude Onizuka,
brother of mission specialist Ellison Onizuka.
   Thousands of tourists have been converging on the area, seeking
the best views available from outside the Kennedy Space Center. In
Titusville, campers parked their RVs on the grass strip along the
Indian River and relaxed in lawn chairs. Others pitched tents or
pulled up in vans.
   Police and tourism officials said most of the hundreds of
thousands of people expected would probably arrive from midnight to
the pre-dawn hours from Miami, Tampa and Orlando, all three of them
within a few hours drive.
   NASA officials said about 3,000 special guests sought
invitations to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the first
space shuttle since Challenger exploded 32 months ago. As of
Wednesday afternoon, about two-thirds had said they would be here.
   ``We don't solicit'' VIPs to watch the launches, said NASA
spokesman Eugene Marianetti. ``They come to us.''
   Sen. John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, planned
to join about a half-dozen other senators and about 40 House
members on a flight to the space center early Thursday for a
pre-launch congressional briefing, said Martha DiSario, press
secretary for the Ohio Democrat.
   The two members of Congress who have ridden on the shuttle _
Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, and Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. _ also planned
to attend the launch, spokesmen for the lawmakers said.
   Several other former astronauts are on the list, including Saudi
Arabian Sultan Al Saud, who was a payload specialist on one of the
shuttle missions.
   Other celebrities expected to be watch the liftoff include
entertainer John Denver, actor John Travolta and actress Darryl
Hannah, NASA said.
   Denver's interest in the shuttle is as potential astronaut on a
Soviet spacecraft. The singer-actor-entertainer wants to ride
aboard the Soviet Mir space station and recently spent three days
at the Johnson Space Center undergoing a medical evaluation given
to all astronaut applicants.
   Denver was one of a number of Americans asked by the Soviets to
fly in their space program, according to a spokeswoman for Denver.
   Administration officials on the list include Lt. Gen. James
Abrahamson, whose resignation as director of the Strategic Defense
Initiative, President Reagan's space-based missile defense program
known as Star Wars, was announced this week. Abrahamson is a former
associate administrator of NASA's Office of Space Flight.
   William P. Rogers, who headed the presidential commission that
investigated the Challenger accident, and other members of that
panel, are expected. So are members of the National Research
Council, an arm of the American Academy of Sciences that NASA
appointed to oversee the shuttle redesign as a result of the Rogers
Commission recommendations.
   Dignitaries at the tragic Challenger launch viewed the liftoff
from a temporary VIP site about three miles from the pad. NASA had
begun building a permanent viewing site there when an Air Force
study raised concerns about safety so close to the launch site.

   A poll Wednesday put the presidential race at
precisely the same place it was before Sunday's debate _ a
statistical dead heat, with 50 percent for George Bush and 46
percent for Michael Dukakis.
   The national ABC News survey, conducted Monday and Tuesday among
674 likely voters, mirrored the 50-46 result of an ABC poll
conducted last week. The new poll had a margin of error of plus or
minus 5 points.
   An overnight poll by ABC immediately after the debate found
respondents divided on who won, and none of four such polls
measured any significant movement in support as a result of the
event. An ABC poll done Monday found increasing numbers calling the
debate a tie.
   ABC said its polls have found the race ``basically a tie'' since
the Republican National Convention last month, when Bush made up a
lead Dukakis had taken from the Democratic convention in July.

   A U.S. mediator said South Africa,
Angola and Cuba extended on Wednesday talks on ending Angola's
civil war. Officials said a timetable for withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops remained a key issue.
   The talks, which were to end Wednesday, will continue and U.S.
mediators ``are confident that the remaining questions will be
approached in a positive spirit which will result in a final
accord,'' U.S. envoy Chester Crocker said.
   Crocker, assistant U.S. secretary of state for African affairs,
said in a statement, ``The parties involved in the Brazzaville
talks continue to show a constructive attitude at the negotiating
table.''
   He met separately with the South African and Angolan-Cuban
delegations.
   President Mobutu Seso Seko of Zaire meanwhile sought to arrange
an African summit to negotiate an end to the 13-year-old conflict,
said government sources in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital. The sources
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Speaking on the third day of U.S.-mediated peace talks between
South Africa and an Angolan-Cuban delegation, South Africa's chief
negotiator, Neil Van Heerden said, ``It is still difficult to say
whether there will be an accord signed in Brazzaville.''
   Van Heerden, director-general of foreign affairs department,
told reporters, ``There is still a gulf between us and the
Angolans.''
   Cuban spokesman Alcibiades Hidalgo said Cuban forces ``could
only leave after fulfilling all its obligations.''
   Hidalgo added, ``If South African continues to link the
withdrawal of Cuban troops to independence for Namibia, and
requires their pullout within 12 months, this could constitute an
obstacle to the conclusion of an accord.''
   South Africa has withdrawn its forces from Angola and insists
that Angola send home an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops. Angola
initially said it would need four years for the Cuban withdrawal,
while South Africa said the troops should be out in one year. The
Brazzaville talks were aimed at reaching a compromise.
   Van Heerden said South Africa recognized it was ``difficult to
demand the immediate withdrawal of 50,000 Cubans,'' particularly
because of Angola's internal security problems. The Marxist
government there has been battling the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, which has been supported by South
Africa, the United States and other countries.
   African diplomats have said they hope the Brazzaville talks will
lead to a formal agreement signed at the United Nations.
   The latest round of talks began Monday. The main issue has been
the length of time Cuban troops will remain in Angola once South
Africa begins its implementation of a U.N. independence plan for
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   South Africa regards the Cuban presence in Angola as a threat to
South-West Africa, Angola's southern neighbor, as well as a menace
to its own security.

   Television can't make you feel the
ground shake when the space shuttle starts flying and can't make
you feel the awe as this 16-story-tall structure rises from the
ground. But you'll see it better and longer than the people who are
on the spot.
   If the weather is clear, a person in Launch Control can see the
shuttle clear the tower and do its majestic 120-degree turn, and
follow it until it becomes a pinpoint of light 4 minutes later.
   But Air Force cameras at a nearby base stay with the shuttle far
longer. The home viewer clearly can see the ship's spent solid fuel
booster rockets fall into the Atlantic Ocean, 150 miles downrange,
two minutes into the flight.
   The Challenger explosion 2{ years ago came 73 seconds after
liftoff when the ship was only 8.9 miles away from its launchpad.

   Three children and two teen-agers, huddled
together in one room, died in a blaze Wednesday as firefighters cut
through iron burglar bars to reach them.
   Another child was in critical condition with burns, officials
said.
   ``At this time, the cause is still under investigation,'' said
Dallas Fire Department investigator Raymond Lee.
   Lee said a gasoline can was found in the house. ``All we know at
this point is that it was bought to mow the yard,'' he said, but
didn't know if it had any gas in it.
   Beverly Handy of the Dallas County Medical Examiner's office
identified the victims as Jasmine Jordan, 1; Ericka Jordan, 9;
Jamal Jordan, 6; Bernard Jordan, 16; and Demetra Jordan, 18.
   The causes of the deaths had not been determined, Handy said.
   Ketrick Jordan, 10, was in critical condition with burns over
about half of his body, said Parkland Memorial Hospital spokesman
Tom Geddie. A blood drive had been started for him at the hospital,
officials said.
   Officials said the children lived with their grandmother,
52-year-old Molly Jordan, who was at work when the fire began.
Called to the scene by fire officials, she later was hospitalized
for shock.
   The children were found gathered in one bedroom, suggesting they
were aware of the fire, officials said. Fire officials found the
oldest boy, Bernard, huddled over two of the younger children _
apparently trying to protect them _ on the floor between two twin
beds.
   ``Just guessing, I'd say it took at least five minutes longer
getting in,'' because of the bars, said investigator Doug Preston.
``It could have been longer. A few minutes can be the difference
between life and death.''
   The fire department received the call at 4:09 a.m. and arrived
with two vehicles, including a bar-cutting saw, at 4:12 a.m.,
Preston said.
   Fire investigator Don Howard said firefighters also were
hampered by a love seat pushed against the house door.
   It was not the first time burglar bars have slowed fire rescue
or escape efforts in the city.
   Shortly after four women and three children died in January 1986
in a house protected by barred windows and doors, the Dallas City
Council changed the building code requiring the bars be able to
open on hinges from the inside.
   The law wasn't retroactive. In August 1987, two separate fires
in which bars were on the windows claimed the lives of three people.
   ``The newer Dallas code requires that the bars be able to open
from the inside,'' Preston said. ``These were the older ones. They
can't be pulled off. They're usually bolted through the walls.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, pledging to
shut a revolving door between government jobs and private lobbying,
derided George Bush on Wednesday for an administration he said was
``a wheel of fortune for future foreign agents.''
   Maintaining an aggressive assault on his Republican rival,
Dukakis also ridiculed Bush's new tax-deferred savings plan. Waving
a $20 bill to represent the amount an average family would save in
a year, he declared, ``George Bush plays Santa Claus to the wealthy
and Ebenezer Scrooge to the rest of us.''
   Before a large crowd that filled a street at the center of
Greensburg in western Pennsylvania, the Democratic presidential
nominee sought to link the vice president with allegations of
ethical violations and illegality by former offiials of the Reagan
administration, and with the lobbying for foreign governments of
Bush's own associates.
   ``George Bush may be satisfied with this administration's Hall
of Shame _ dozens and dozens of top administration officials who
broke the law or violated the public trust,'' Dukakis said.
   ``He may be satisfied with letting Japan make the cars while his
former colleagues make the license plates. I say America can do
better than that.''
   Later, the Massachusetts governor met for an hour in New York
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in a session
Dukakis said was ``just a chance to get acquainted.''
   Bush met last week with Shevardnadze, who told reporters the
vice president had been involved in past high-level U.S.-Soviet
meetings.
   Dukakis said afterward: ``I made clear to the foreign minister
that I was not here to negotiate or discuss specific proposals. We
have one president, and I support President Reagan's effort to move
forward on these issues right up to the end of his term of office.''
   But Dukakis also said he brought up the plight of Soviet Jews
and the pace of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Shevardnadze, asked which of the two candidates he preferred,
said diplomatically, ``I'll tell you after the election.''
   Dukakis was meeting later with West German leader Hans Dietrich
Genscher and planned a Thursday morning meeting with French leader
Francois Mitterand.
   In Pennsylvania, Dukakis pledged to sign ``the day I take
office'' an executive order toughening restrictions on lobbying by
former administration officials. An accompanying statement said he
would issue a second order curbing government contacts with former
members of Congress ``for some period of time.''
   ``In a Dukakis administration, we're not going to turn the White
House into a wheel of fortune for future foreign agents,'' Dukakis
said. ``In a Dukakis White House, the staff is going to pledge
allegiance to only one flag, and that's Old Glory.''
   Bush said last spring that he was ``tired of being embarrassed''
by ethical lapses in government and said he would establish a new
ethics panel in the White House if elected to try and ``avoid the
excesses of the past.''
   He did not go into detail.
   Dukakis, in renewing his assault on the administration's ethical
record, cited the lobbying work of a firm whose members include
Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater and other campaign advisers.
   ``George Bush may be satisfied that some of his top campaign
aides were hired guns for a Bahamian government whose leaders are
under investigation for drug activity. I say America can do better
than that,'' he said.
   Dukakis aides outlined an ``integrity in government initiative''
that Dukakis said he would sign as president. It said top officials
of a Dukakis White House would be barred from any lobbying efforts
for the duration of the Dukakis administration, regardless of when
they left their government jobs.
   Aides said that would extend current ethics act prohibitions on
lobbying, which range from one to three years after leaving office
depending on the type of lobbying activity. They said it would also
extend the prohibition on lobbying by former White House officials
to include lobbying of any executive branch agency.
   A description prepared by the campaign said it would eliminate
regulations of the Reagan administration which divided the
executive office of the president into nine components, a move that
allowed former offiials of one component to immediately lobby
officials in another component after leaving government. The
statement called this arrangement an ``artificial division'' and
``the Deaver loophole,'' a reference to convicted former Reagan
aide Michael Deaver.
   ``As a result of this loophole, Michael Deaver could only be
charged with perjury,'' the statement said.
   Dukakis aides handed out printed sheets listing 64 former
administration officials that it said ``were convicted, forced to
resign or misused their office for personal gain.'' The list,
however, included some people who were later cleared and some, such
as James Watt, who resigned after getting into political hot water.
He was not accused of ethics violations.

   A jury deliberating the weapons charges case
against syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan recessed for the night
Wednesday after discussing the matter for three hours without
reaching a verdict.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Arthur L. Burnett Sr.
sent the jury home at 6 p.m., and ordered the 12-member panel to
avoid reading about or listening to broadcast accounts of the trial.
   Rowan, an outspoken opponent of handgun use and possession, has
been charged with using an unregistered pistol and ammunition to
shoot a youth who took an unauthorized dip in his pool.
   If convicted of both misdemeanor offenses, the 63-year-old
columnist could face up to two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   ``They came in here to prosecute a celebrity,'' Rowan's
attorney, Raoul Carroll, said at the close of a two-day trial in
D.C. Superior Court. ``They aren't interested in the truth.''
   Carroll also argued that Rowan's son, Carl Jr., had repeatedly
been told by police officials that he did not have to register the
weapon his father later used to wound the teen-age intruder.
   ``He was depending upon the competence and intelligence of those
people that the District of Columbia put there (to advise citizens
on gun registration),'' Carroll argued. ``He was entirely at the
mercy of the District of Columbia.''
   The case centered on whether Rowan and his son were misled by
city police officials about the district's strict handgun
registration policy and the prosecution's contention that Rowan Sr.
was not authorized to handle the weapon.
   The handgun ordinance prohibits any person except security
officers from registering weapons, although exemptions commonly are
made for law enforcement officers.
   Rowan's son was an FBI agent when he tried to register the
weapon. Inspector James R. Lee, head of the city's gun control
unit, testified that Rowan Jr. was not authorized to transfer the
weapon to anyone.
   Rowan testified that he was given the .22-caliber pistol by his
son in 1982, after receiving several death threats from persons
purporting to be members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   The columnist testified that he shot Benjamin Smith, 18, of
suburban Chevy Chase, Md., in the early hours of June 14 because he
thought Smith was trying to break into his home.
   Thomas C. Collier, the city's attorney, argued in closing that
the case before the jury was ``vry simple.''
   ``We are here simply because the handgun is not registered,''
Collier said. ``The death threats, the shooting and the issue of
trespassing have nothing to do with this case.''
   Police officers who investigated the shooting testified that a
door at the rear of Rowan's home showed signs that someone had
tried to break in. One officer also testified that the police
investigation revealed Smith had been shot at close range just
outside Rowan's home.

<HEAD>Sudan Admits Loss of Two Towns in South to Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>

   The army said Wednesday it lost two
strategic towns in southern Sudan in fierce fighting that left
heavy losses.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Fathi Ahmed Ali said his forces in Katre
``have been withdrawn to other areas'' and that some units were
withdrawn from Kiala.
   He said heavy fighting continued around Kiala, but a communique
issued later by the armed forces command said Kiala had been
evacuated and troops withdrawn to another town, Toreit.
   Katre and Kiala are near the Ugandan border.
   Ali spoke to reporters after a meeting with Ahmed Ali
el-Mirghani, chairman of the Sudanese Supreme Council, which has
the same role as a head of state.
   The military communique confirmed a report by the newspaper
Al-Ayam on the fall of the two towns, about 825 miles south of
Khartoum.
   Al-Ayam reported continued fighting around the famine-hit town
of Toreit, about 50 miles northwest of Katre.
   The army did not say when Katre and Kiala were evacuated, but
the rebel Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army claimed its fighters
captured Katre on Sept. 16, Kiala on Sept. 25, and a third small
town, Labalo, around the same time.
   The Sudanese military denied the claim, but on Monday, Mauris
Lawya, governor of the Equatoria region, said troops had evacuated
the towns. He said, however, that the situation was ``still
unclear.''
   On Tuesday, a rebel radio broadcast from Ethiopia said that
Liberation Army troops had captured Kiala, inflicting heavy losses
on government troops.
   The rebels took up arms against the government in 1983,
demanding autonomy and administrative and economic reforms in the
south. They claim to control 90 percent of the southern
countryside, while the government retains authority in most major
cities and towns.
   The military communique Wednesday said the rebels received
unlimited military support from ``quarters hostile to Sudan.'' It
accused ``regional and international quarters'' of involvement in
``this dirty plot.''
   The communique said the rebel forces began attacking Kiala Sept.
17 ``with more than 5,000 troops and arms superior even to those of
some regular armies'' and concentrated their assaults on eastern
Equatoria region.
   ``After the increase of the shelling and the arrival of more
support to the rebels and the great losses of our army and
civilians between killed and injured, the commander has decided to
pull out of Kiala,'' it said.

   The capital's military commander said
Wednesday that prominent businessmen and politicians are under
surveillance for allegedly backing renegade soldiers who want to
topple President Corazon Aquino.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon made the remarks before a
congressional committee one day after the arrest of Lt. Col.
Eduardo Matillano, a leader of last year's bloody attempt to topple
Mrs. Aquino.
   Elsewhere, communist New People's Army guerrillas burned a
passenger bus and killed a town mayor, two paramilitary agents and
a soldier in separate incidents. Soldiers killed two rebels.
   In his testimony, Bizon refused to identify those under
surveillance. He said the military was collecting evidence ``before
we take up action.''
   The business executives and politicians were providing
``financial support and a political component to the movement,'' he
said.
   Matillano, former Philippine Constabulary commander for Nueva
Ecija province, played a major role in the failed coup Aug. 28,
1987, which killed at least 53 people and wounded 300. The attempt
was led by former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, who escaped
after being captured and remains at large.
   Biazon said Tuesday that Matillano had been recruiting dissident
soldiers for a new coup plot and that unidentified civilians were
involved.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said at a news conference that
Mrs. Aquino ordered the military to pursue its investigation of the
dissidents' alleged civilian backers. Ramos said he did not know
the names of all those under suspicion.
   Biazon said some of the recently arrested followers of deposed
President Ferdinand Marcos provided names of their backers.
   The opposition Union for National Action, led by Vice President
Salvador Laurel, demanded in a statement that Mrs. Aquino release
immediately the names of all those suspected of links to Honasan
and other rebel soldiers.
   It said that otherwise, ``it only shows the administration is
involved in a witch hunt which it probably hopes will be a
convenient smokescreen to the unending tales of corruption, which
characterizes the government today.''
   Two assassins believed to be communist guerrillas on Wednesday
killed Mayor Lavi Manpatilan of Esperanza while he was attending a
wedding in a nearby city about 500 miles southeast of Manila,
police said.
   Manpatilan, who heads a 500-man anti-communist militia force,
was shot six times, they said. The gunmen escaped.
   In Laguna province, military regional spokesman Col. Hernani
Figueroa said four rebels abducted a driver and conductor of the
Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. after setting the bus afire Monday
in San Pablo, about 50 miles south of Manila. But bus company
officials said they suspected a labor dispute was behind the
incident.
   In Lian town in Batangas province, guerrillas killed two
paramilitary agents and a soldier in a jeep Tuesday, a military
report said.
   The military said soldiers killed two communist rebels in a
15-minute clash Tuesday on the outskirts of San Francisco town in
Agusan del Sur province, about 540 miles south of Manila.

   Communist East German border guards shot at two
men who scaled the Berlin Wall to flee to the West on Wednesday,
and they arrested a woman accompanying the men, police said.
   The men escaped uninjured into West Berlin, said a West Berlin
police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police said the woman was arrested by the East Berlin guards
after she fell while running and hurt herself.
   The incident came two days after the three allied powers in West
Berlin issued a protest note condemning the use of force in
preventing an escape attempt Sunday night.
   In another incident, East Berlin border guards fired warning
shots Sunday night to stop two men racing to scale the
heavily-fortified wall that divides the city. They were arrested,
but police said they were not injured.
   In Monday's protest note, signed by the United States, France
and Britain, the allies condemned the shooting as a ``violation of
basic human rights'' and an ``affront against the values of
civilized society.''
   The West German government and the West Berlin Senate
immediately condemned Wednesday's incident.
   More than 322 people people have fled East Germany to West
Berlin or West Germany this year.

   Israeli troops Wednesday
barred supporters of American-born legislator Meir Kahane from
holding his anti-Arab party's election convention in the West Bank.
   In Jerusalem, police banned Israeli extremists from touring the
Temple Mount, a sacred site claimed by Moslems and Jews.
   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded nine Arabs in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, including a 10-year-old boy shot in the
head while playing on the roof of his house in the city of Nablus,
hospital officials said, speaking anonymously.
   The army confirmed three wounded.
   Kahane, whose Kach Party has called for expulsion of all Arabs
from Israel and the occupied territories, scheduled his convention
for the Arab city of Hebron despite an army order banning the
meeting.
   ``I want the Arabs to realize that in four years, when I am
prime minister, it will be a Jewish city, not an Arab city,''
Kahane said before departing Jerusalem.
   He led two buses and a dozen cars and vans on a three-hour
odyssey seeking a back road to Hebron. At times the caravan
appeared lost and Kahane at one point asked an Arab villager for
directions.
   The caravan, stoned by Arabs in several villages, was finally
stopped by an army patrol seven miles south of Jerusalem.
   The right-wing Likud Bloc also mounted a West Bank tour
Wednesday, taking about 4,000 Israelis to visit Jewish settlements
near Nablus, 30 miles north of Jerusalem.
   Benny Begin, son of former prime minister Menachem Begin and a
candidate for parliament in the Nov. 1 elections, told the crowd
Likud would never trade the West Bank in a peace agreement.
   During the tour, one Israeli passenger was hit in the head by a
rock and taken to a hospital, the army said. Israeli radio
identified her as Shoshana Greidi, 73.
   In east Jerusalem, Arab youths rioted for second day in the
Jabal Mukaber neighborhood to protest the death of a 19-year-old
Palestinian hit in the mouth with a tear gas canister Monday,
police and Israel radio said. Police fired tear gas to disperse the
crowd.
   Earlier Wednesday in Jerusalem, officers turned back about 30
members of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group which demands Jewish
control over the area known in Arabic as Haram El-Sharif, or Noble
Enclosure.
   The raised platform is sacred to Jews as the site of the holy
temple destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 and to Moslems as the
place where the prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven in the 7th
century.
   The mount, dominated by the golden Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa
mosques, is under Moslem administration.
   A visit by the group last year prompted violent protests by
hundreds of Palestinians, and police feared Moslem protests would
be more severe this year.
   Gershon Solomon, head of the group, called the ban ``painful,
humiliating and anti-Jewish.''
   Also Wednesday, the office of Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
retracted a hard-line comment issued a day earlier.
   Rabin said Tuesday the army was intentionally trying to wound
Palestinian protesters with newly introduced plastic bullets. ``Our
aim is to cause more casualties,'' he said.
   But his spokesman Eitan Haber said Rabin meant to stress that
plastic bullets were being used to avoid lethal injuries caused by
lead bullets.
   In Washington, the State Department said it was disturbed by
Israel's use of plastic bullets.
   ``We can see no justification for a policy admittedly designed
to cause an increase in casualties,'' spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 278 Palestinians have been
killed. Six Israelis also have died.

   George Bush toured the small towns of
central Illinois in a bus caravan Wednesday, painting Democratic
opponent Michael Dukakis as ``an inexperienced liberal governor''
bent on beefing up the police powers of the Internal Revenue
Service.
   Stressing policy differences with Dukakis, and suggesting more
than once that the Massachusetts governor would make it easier for
the IRS to go after ordinary citizens, Bush declared, ``I am with
the American people.''
   Bush's eight-bus caravan, complete with an entourage of country
music entertainers, wended its way north on U.S. highway 51,
passing farm after farm and stopping at towns like El Paso,
population 2,700, and Minonk, population 2,250.
   Bush's trip was intended to galvanize Republicans and lure away
Democrats in central Illinois to offset the traditionally large
Democratic vote in Chicago and Cook County.
   ``He wants to squeeze another $35 billion bucks out of the
taxpayers' pocket,'' Bush said, claiming the IRS would have to
double its workforce to 200,000 people under Dukakis in order to
carry out his proposal to collect billions of dollars in delinquent
and evaded taxes.
   ``I have confidence in the honesty of the American people,''
Bush said. ``I am not for a program that is going to increase IRS
seizures and give the IRS more power.''
   Bush rode in the first bus, accompanied by his wife, Barbara,
and country music singers Loretta Lynn, Crystal Gayle and Peggy Sue
Wright, who warmed up the crowds with favorites such as ``Coal
Miner's Daughter'' and ``Praise the Lord, I Saw the Light.''
   
   
   Bush told voters he has come under attack for criticizing
Dukakis' veto of a bill that would have required public school
teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
Dukakis acted after an advisory opinion from the state Supreme
Court said the bill was unconstitutional.
   ``The liberals hate it,'' Bush said, referring to his criticism.
``They can't stand it. But I am right and I am with the American
people on this and on voluntary prayer in school and a whole bunch
of things I consider fundamental values.''
   He stressed that he supports the death penalty and Dukakis
opposes it.
   Bush said the United States was able to sign a nuclear-arms
treaty with the Soviet Union last December ``because we
strengthened America and knew how to negotiate with the Soviets.
   ``And I don't think this is any time to turn to an inexperienced
liberal governor of Massachusetts to handle the national security
matters of the United States of America,'' Bush said.
   After six stops and six speeches, Bush was having some trouble
getting his message out. He told a small audience at a Del Monte
corn packing plant that the Reagan administration had achieved
success in dealing with the Soviets because ``strength through
peace works, and we'd better never forget that.''
   With 25 electoral votes, Illinois is one of the big prizes in
the presidential race, and Bush has made five visits here since
mid-summer seeking an edge in a neck-and-neck contest.
   ``Illinois is vital to the election,'' Bush said at a Illinois
State University rally in Normal at the start of the day. ``And
before Nov. 8, I'm going to be back again and again because the
land of Lincoln is going to be absolutely critical in choosing the
next president.''
   At the rally with students, Bush attacked Dukakis' college-loan
proposal, under which funds borrowed for school would be repaid
over a long period by deductions from paychecks.
   ``We do not need to put the IRS on your tail for the rest of
your life as the reward for a college education,'' Bush said,
putting in a pitch for his own plan for a college savings bond
under which interest would accumulate tax free.
   The Dukakis campaign said Bush misstated the programs. It said
Bush claimed the student loans were government loans rather than
bank loans, and it said Dukakis' IRS program only calls for a 6
percent annual growth rate in the number of IRS personnel.
   Before farm audiences, Bush pledged to expand agricultural
markets, resist protectionism and never impose a grain embargo as
President Carter did.
   Other communities on Bush's seven-stop tour were Wenona,
Mendota, and West Brooklyn, which with a population of 200 was the
smallest town on the trip.

   The legislation requires 30 days' notice from the secretary of
defense to specified committees of the plans and scope for any
proposed military exercise involving U.S. personnel if construction
costs are expected to exceed $100,000.
   The president said he was approving the bill with the
understanding that this section ``encompasses only exercises where
providing 30 days' advance notice is feasible and consistent with
my constitutional authority and duty to protect the national
security.''
   The compromise measure adds to the current fiscal year
construction budget of $8.3 billion but falls short of the $9.7
billion sought by Reagan.
   The measure includes $65 million for the final stage of
construction of a national test facility in Colorado for Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as Star Wars. The $100
million project will be used to test SDI components.
   Reagan had also sought $31 million for construction of a
railroad-based version of the MX nuclear-tipped missile, but
Congress appropriated no funds for the purpose, leaving the
decision on the future of the rail-based MX weapon up to the next
administration.
   The measure provides $173 million to the Navy to build new bases
around the nation's coasts and $50 million to build a closed
incinerator at Tooele Army Depot in Utah to destroy obsolete and
aging chemical weapons. The Army is continuing work on new chemical
weapons although the president has called for an international
conference to outlaw their use.
   The measure was the sixth bill the president has signed out of
the 11 appropraitions measures that Congress considers each year.

<HEAD>Pilot In Airbus Air Show Crash Suspended Eight Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France suspended for eight years on Wednesday the
license of the pilot who was at the controls of an Air France
jetliner that crashed at an air show last June, killing three
people.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre said in a statement that
pilot Michel Asseline also would lose his qualification as a flight
instructor for life.
   The license of co-pilot Pierre Mazieres was suspended for two
months.
   Air France had already fired Asseline, who was blamed for flying
the new Airbus A320 too low and too slow at the June 26 air show at
Mulhouse, eastern France. The plane failed to clear a stand of
trees at the end of the runway.
   The actions followed a government inquiry into the crash.
   Delebarre was also quoted Wednesday as saying the accident
played a role in his decision Tuesday to replace Air France
President Jacques Friedmann.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse quoted Delebarre as
saying, ``The faults noted by the commission of inquiry called for
measures, both with regard to the two pilots concerned and with
regard to the top official of a company whose image is of national
and international importance.''

   The Soviet Union and Canada have repaired
diplomatic damage resulting from the expulsions of accused spies
last summer and will have their embassies back to full strength
soon, officials said Wednesday.
   Canada expelled or barred the return of 19 Soviet diplomats in
June, saying they had engaged in espionage.
   Moscow retaliated by ejecting or barring the return of 13
Canadian diplomats and by withdrawing Soviet support staff at the
Canadian Embassy in Moscow.
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark met Wednesday with his
Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and said afterward that
``relations between Canada and the Soviet Union are sufficiently
important that we should put the events of June behind us.''
   ``So we're doing that,'' Clark concluded.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov confirmed
the understanding during an afternoon news conference.
   ``Maybe it's time to return to the previous situation concerning
the personnel of both embassies, in Moscow and in Ottawa,'' he said.
   Clark said he expects Canada will have the right to rehire all
25 Soviet support staff pulled out of the Canadian Embassy, but it
will not fully exercise that right. The government has decided to
replace some of the Soviet citizens with Russian-speaking Canadians.
   The diplomats were in New York to attend the 43rd U.N. General
Assembly session.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Spain on Wednesday
concluded an agreement for eight more years of American military
use of Spanish bases.
   The deal was sealed at a meeting between Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco
Fernandez-Ordonez.
   For the first time, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman
said, no U.S. economic or military aid will be provided for use of
the bases.
   Redman said the agreement underscored that a U.S. military
presence in Spain served the ``common interest'' of the two
countries.
   He also said the two sides were able to resolve a nuclear
question that had become entwined in the negotiations.
   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzales initially had vowed to
keep Spanish territory and naval ports free of U.S. nuclear
weapons. Worldwide U.S. policy, meanwhile, is to neither confirm
nor deny the presence of such weapons on American warships or
fighter planes.
   Redman said the U.S. policy would be upheld. Presumably, this
means Spainish authorities will not put such questions to American
commanders.
   Earlier in the year, the United States agreed to remove 72 U.S.
F16 jets from Torrejon, a base outside Madrid. The warplanes were
shifted to Italy.
   This apparently satisfied Gonzales' initial demand for a sharp
reduction in the U.S. military presence in Spain.
   Redman said U.S. and Spanish negotiators had worked hard to
resolve all the details of the agreement. ``We're happy on both
sides'' with the outcome, he said.
   Shultz also met with Polish Foreign Minister Tadeusz Olechowski
on recent developments in the East European country. A veteran
politician and foe of the outlawed trade union Solidarity,
Miecyslaw Rakowski, was chosen prime minister on Monday by the
Communist Party Central Committee in Warsaw.
   Redman said Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead would
visit Poland Oct. 12 as part of a growing dialogue with Polish
authorities. ``We are very interested in these developments,''
Redman said.
   The U.S. official said Poland also was ``very interested in
continuing to pursue the dialogue'' with Washington.

<HEAD>$10.8 Billion Transportation Bill Heads to Reagan For Signature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress sent a $10.8 billion transportation
spending bill for 1989 to the White House on Wednesday, several
days after lawmakers made it veto-proof by removing language
airline labor unions had championed.
   The House gave final congressional approval to the measure on a
voice vote shortly after the Senate signed off on the bill with a
voice vote of its own. The House had given initial approval to the
measure Tuesday on a 392-13 vote, but had to consider it again
after the Senate made last-minute technical amendments.
   Reagan was expected to sign the legislation by Saturday, the
start of the 1989 federal fiscal year. It is the eighth
appropriations bill the president has received as lawmakers rush to
send Reagan all 13 spending measures before the new year begins.
   Last Thursday, House-Senate negotiators sliced labor-sought
language out of the bill that Reagan had said would cause him to
veto the entire measure.
   That provision, included in the House version of the bill
approved earlier this year, would have required airlines to pay
benefits to employees whose jobs are lost or whose incomes are
diminished due to mergers.
   Besides providing $10.8 billion in new spending for fiscal 1989,
the appropriations bill would allow the government to spend another
$14.7 billion on transportation programs, money that would come
from various federal taxes on fuel and air travel.
   The bill would funnel $3.2 billion to mass transit, $12.2
billion to highway programs, $6.3 billion to aviation and $2.8
billion to the Coast Guard. Among other things, it provides $584
million in grants for Amtrak, the national passenger railroad.
   The legislation not only would spend $2.6 billion more on
transportation than Reagan proposed in the budget he gave Congress
in February, but also rearranges the priorities he sought.
   In a battle that Reagan has waged with congressional Democrats
since the early 1980s, the president preferred dramatically less
spending for mass transit, slightly less for highways, slightly
more for aviation and no money at all for Amtrak.
   Despite those differences, the provision that most piqued the
president was the one protecting airline workers. Supporters argued
that in an era of frequent mergers, workers' jobs must be
protected. The administration considered it an intrusion into the
workings of the free market.
   The legislation contains sections that would block the
construction of a shopping mall in Manassas, Va., near the site of
two important Civil War battles, and prohibit the government from
withholding federal highway aid for states whose drivers disobey
the 55 mph speed limit. Legislation passed last year allowing
states to increase their speed limits to 65 mph dropped such
sanctions for those states.
   The measure would also allow Logan International Airport in
Boston temporarily to continue new, higher landing fees for small
airplanes to encourage them to use other airfields.
   The bill would allow Logan to continue receiving federal aid
until the federal Department of Transportation completes an
investigation of the controversial program. If the agency
determines that the Logan plan is illegal, government assistance to
the airport would be halted.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle, continuing the GOP strategy of painting Democrat Michael
Dukakis as too liberal for American voters, said Wednesday that
Dukakis had close ties to a group that advocates deep cuts in
defense.
   Quayle said that the group, ``Jobs With Peace Campaign,'' has
``an extreme liberal agenda, the main feature being a radical cut
in the U.S. defense budget.''
   On Tuesday, Quayle called on Dukakis to resign his membership in
the American Civil Liberties Union, another group the Republicans
have attacked in saying Dukakis is out of touch with mainstream
views.
   Quayle's latest salvo came at a fund-raising rally for Rep. Beau
Boulter, who is trying to capture the Senate seat of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee.
   Under Texas law, Bentsen is allowed to undertake both his Senate
re-election bid and the vice presidential race. Boulter is trailing
badly in the Senate race.
   Quayle has barely mentioned Bentsen in his campaign swing
through Texas. But he told Boulter, ``We want you to be in the
United States Senate this year.''
   GOP strategists say they want Quayle to concentrate his
firepower on Dukakis, not on the No. 2 man on the ticket.
   Quayle said that Dukakis was on the advisory board of the
Boston-based group, which in a 1987 fund-raising mailing said it
intended to ``make the federal budget a local issue by showing the
tradeoff between military and domestic spending'' and supported a
25 percent cut in defense spending.
   The list of advisers to the organization ``reads like a roster
of the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party'' and includes
Jesse Jackson, George McGovern, Rep. Ron Dellums of California and
Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Quayle said.
   Among the group's goals, Quayle said, was to cancel the MX,
Midgetman and Star Wars weapons systems, the stealth bomber and to
cut the M-1 tank, ``the very one Mr. Dukakis was riding in _ by 50
percent.'' The Republicans have been making much of Dukakis' ride
several weeks ago in the tank at a General Dynamics plant in
Detroit.
   Quayle said Dukakis had been ``more than an adviser'' to the
group, testifying at a 1983 mock hearing launching ``Jobs With
Peace Week'' and praising the group's aims.
   ``Yet now, in the midst of an election, the man from
Massachusetts is riding in tanks, claiming to support weapons he's
previously opposed and generally trying to hide his past
anti-defense positions,'' he said.
   Michael Brown, program director for the Boston-based group, said
that Dukakis is indeed on the advisory board. Other members include
Dellums, Kerry and Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., he said.
   ``The group's purpose is basically to point out that there has
been a huge increase in military spending ... ,'' Brown said. ``We
do see big tradeoffs.''
   Quayle headed to Dallas for a fund-raiser and rally before
returning to Washington, where he will prepare for his debate next
Wednesday with Bentsen.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Indiana senator had an upbeat message
when he addressed young people at an El Paso job corps center that
is rated as the nation's highest in terms of placing youngsters in
jobs, advanced training and the military.
   He told the mostly Hispanic audience, ``The greatest
opportunities in life are still ahead of you.''
   ``We are confident in your future,'' he said. ``We are confident
that you will be confident.''

   Santa Ana winds lashed two wildfires out
of the foothills toward housing tracts Wednesday, destroying a
home, closing schools and freeways and spewing smoke that 15 miles
away blotted out the sun.
   A blaze dubbed the Texas fire erupted at 10:30 a.m. at the mouth
of Duncan Canyon, 50 miles east of Los Angeles, and the wind also
fanned to life the embers of a controlled burn near Glen Helen that
was squelched on Tuesday, authorities said.
   The Texas blaze, pushed down from the Lytle Creek area by gusts
up to 30 mph, burned over 2,500 acres, destroying a home and
beehives, said Mary Chislock, spokeswoman for the California
Department of Forestry.
   One person, a civilian, was treated for smoke inhalation, she
said.
   The other blaze, 250 to 300 acres, was about two miles away near
Glen Helen, where authorities had intentionally been burning away
long-overgrown brush the day before, said CDF spokeswoman LoVae
Pray-Martines.
   The fires posed a threat to homes in the northern Fontana and
Rialto areas. The Verdemont Boys Ranch, a juvenile custody
facility, as well as a high school and some residents in the
northern Rialto area were evacuated.
   About 300 firefighters and eight air tankers battled the blazes.
   Marcia Nave, who lives in one of four large ranch homes in the
hills above Fontana that were threatened by fire, said she loaded
her van with jewelry, photographs and heirloom guns and waited
until the last minute to leave.
   ``We had to drive through flames. I was afraid of catching the
van on fire,'' said Ms. Nave, as tears formed in her eyes. ``I
don't know what has happened to my house.''
   The fires were burning in a semi-rural area near large housing
tracts, but Fontana police directing traffic said the winds had
shifted direction by early afternoon and that the housing
developments appeared to be safe.
   The National Weather Service predicted northeast winds through
Thursday because of the Santa Ana, a condition in which air flows
from high pressure over the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah
toward low pressure off the California coast.
   Smoke obscured the sun in Riverside, 15 miles away, and was
visible high in the sky above Hemet, 50 miles to the southeast, and
Corona, 35 miles to the southwest. Interstate 15, the main link
between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nev., was closed in both
directions.
   The 2,100 students at Etiwanda High School in Rancho Cucamonga
were sent home, although the school was not endangered, Associate
Superintendent Bette Harrison said.

<TEXT>
   Lord Melody, an outstanding
pioneer of calypso music and a former composer and arranger for
singer Harry Belafonte, has died at the age of 63.
   Lord Melody, born Fitzroy Alexander, died Monday evening in the
Port of Spain General Hospital after a yearlong battle with cancer,
a city mortuary official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
said funeral arrangements were incomplete. He said authorities were
awaiting the arrival of three children who live in the United
States. He had no other information on survivors.
   Melody was one of the greatest and earliest professional
exponents of calypso, the lilting, syncopated musical style
indigenous to Trinidad.
   He first appeared on a calypso stage 42 years ago, said local
impressario Holy Betaudier.
   Melody often used his songs to make social commentaries and was
known for his spicy ballads. During the 1960s and 1970s, he
composed and arranged music for Belafonte.
   Out of that relationship came dozens of hits which helped spread
a mode of expression and type of music that had its origins in the
Caribbean slavery experience.
   His greatest attribute was his humor, said calypso judge Tony
Mitchell.
   ``I knew him for more than 30 years, and I think that he was one
of the greatest (composers of calypso music). His range of calypsos
is testimony to his artistry,'' Mitchell said.
   Lord Melody's humor was perhaps most trenchant and cutting
against his own supposed ugliness. In the 1950s, he was known
affectionately as ``The Boo Boo Man.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate approved legislation Wednesday that
would empower the government to provide $1.3 billion worth of
emergency food and housing, health care, education and other help
to the nation's homeless people over the next two years.
   The House passed a similar measure last month. Negotiators from
the two chambers will have to compose a compromise bill that would
have to be approved by both chambers before it is sent to the White
House for President Reagan's signature.
   The legislation, known as the McKinney Bill, was approved by a
voice vote. It would extend for two years a law that otherwise
would expire with the end of the 1988 federal fiscal year this
Friday.
   The bill would allow the government to provide money to states,
municipalities and private agencies for rental assistance, health
care, mental health services, alcohol and drug abuse programs,
education and job training projects.
   Funds would be available for the purchase and rehabilitation of
group homes. In addition, unused space at Veterans Administration
hospitals would be set aside for the treatment of homeless veterans.
   The actual money for the programs would have to be provided in
separate appropriations bills.
   Advocates for the country's homeless population _ estimated at
between 250,000 and 3 million people _ have been angry because so
far, the government has not fully financed the legislation. In the
first two years of the law, the government has provided only $700
million out of a possible $1.1 billion.
   The measure is named after the late Rep. Stewart B. McKinney,
R-Conn., one of the original sponsors of the bill. McKinney died
May 7, 1987, less than three months after the legislation became
law.

   A car bomb exploded Wednesday at a Syrian
army checkpoint just south of Beirut, killing five people and
injuring 21, police said.
   They said a red Volvo packed with explosives exploded on a
coastal highway bridge as Syrian troops manning the Khalde
checkpoint were searching it. The blast killed the driver and four
other people, police said.
   They said five Syrian troops were among the wounded.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, Lebanon's 13th car
bombing this year. By police count, 107 people have been killed and
398 wounded in the attacks.
   The strategic checkpoint, which links Beirut with the
Druse-controlled central mountains and south Lebanon, was jammed
with traffic.
   Police said Syrian troops immediately cordoned off the area,
closing the Khalde road for an hour.
   They said the Syrians prevented Lebanese policemen from reaching
the blast scene for an investigation. Reporters and photographers
were also barred.
   The car bombing appeared aimed at discrediting Syria's
peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.
   Syria, Lebanon's main power broker, maintains 40,000 troops in
north and east Lebanon and in Moslem west Beirut and its southern
suburbs.

   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will
visit the Soviet Union at the end of this year in the first such
working visit since the Moscow-Beijing split of the 1960s, Soviet
and Chinese officials said Wednesday.
   The trip points to a major warming of Chinese-Soviet relations
and is expected to lead eventually to a Soviet-Chinese summit.
   A later return visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze to China also was planned, but no time was announced.
   Qian met Shevardnadze at the Chinese Mission on Wednesday for a
discussion of Qian's visit, Cambodia and other issues.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov later told
reporters the two ``talked a lot about Cambodia'' and called the
talks ``constructive.'' He said Soviet-Chinese discussions on
Cambodia would continue on the level of experts and deputy foreign
ministers.
   ``They (Shevardnadze and Qian) agreed that actually it must be
decided by the Cambodians, but other countries may help,'' he added.
   In the past the Soviet Union has stayed out of the negotiating
picture and insisted that China and others discuss the matter with
Vietnam.
   Gerasimov said Qian would also meet Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Moscow and added that Moscow hopes the ministerial
visit will lead to a summit between Gorbachev and Chinese leaders.
   The two communist powers, once close friends, split in the 1960s
over ideology, leadership of the international Communist movement
and other issues.
   ``Shevardnadze mentioned that almost everybody in the General
Assembly believes the overall world situation has improved with the
improvement in Soviet-American relations,'' Gerasimov said. ``And
maybe now it is time to improve Soviet-Chinese relations.
   ``Both agreed the state of Chinese-Soviet relations also has a
very major influence on the state of the world at large.''
   Chinese Premier Li Peng indicated earlier this month that China
plans eventually to attend a summit. He said all that was needed
was for lower level talks to reach further agreement on Cambodia
and then a summit could be put on the agenda.
   China and the Soviet Union agreed in October 1985 to an exchange
of visits of foreign ministers, but set no date. The plan stalled
over China's insistence that the Soviets withdraw from Afghanistan;
reduce Soviet troop strength in Mongolia, on the border with China;
and persuade the Soviet-backed Vietnamese government to pull its
estimated 140,000 troops from Cambodia.
   Two of these issues are in the process of being resolved: the
Soviets are withdrawing from Afghanistan and Vietnam has vowed to
withdraw its forces from Cambodia by 1990. Both Vietnam and
Cambodia are communist states.
   Chinese and Soviet vice foreign ministers have exchanged visits
repeatedly in the last few years for talks on Chinese-Soviet border
issues. Qian went to Moscow several times in that capacity. He
became foreign minister in April.
   The forthcoming visit of the 60-year-old Qian, a Russian speaker
who has been posted in Moscow, marks such visit in at least 20
years.
   Former Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua went to Moscow in 1982
to attend the funeral of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, but it was
not a working visit.
   The last Soviet foreign minister to visit China was Andrei
Gromyko, now Soviet president, who went there in 1959. In that
year, then-Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev came to the United
Nations and denounced China.
   In an address before the General Assembly Wednesday, Qian asked
for an international peacekeeping force and committee to monitor an
eventual Vietnamese troop withdrawal from Cambodia and to supervise
free elections.
   He complained that Vietnam is delaying its troop withdrawal and
asked the assembly to adopt still another resolution _ its 10th _
demanding an early pullout.
   Qian emphasized that after a Cambodian solution is reached,
China is ready to join other nations in providing international
guarantees for an independent, neutral and non-aligned Cambodia.
   The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and soon replaced
the pro-Chinese communist regime with a pro-Hanoi, pro-Moscow
government. During the 1975-79 rule by the Khmer Rouge, it is
estimated that about 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people died
from executions, famine and civil unrest.

   The Trail of Tears wagon train left the
Hermitage of Andrew Jackson without a symbolic reconciliation
between Indians and the president who helped send them on a
1,000-mile forced march 150 years ago.
   ``Andy Jackson's done it to us again,'' said wagon train member
Paul Quick, who is part Chickasaw and part Blackfoot, after the
wagoneers crossed wires with the Ladies Hermitage Association,
which maintains the historic mansion.
   The caravan of 11 wagons is recreating the forced march in which
4,000 Indians died on the way to Oklahoma.
   Jackson is associated with the march because he signed the
Indian Removal Act, but Martin Van Buren was president when the
removal began in 1838, said Fred Rolater, a history professor at
Middle Tennessee State University.
   Jackson ``is not the person who supervised the removal of the
Indians, but he had worked hard for it during his career,'' Rolater
said.
   ``When he became president, he was determined to carry it out.
But I don't think anyone would say that he wanted the tragedy that
occurred. He wanted it to be done fairly.''
   When the party arrived at the Hermitage on Tuesday afternoon,
they were told they could stay, but that the gates would be locked
at 5 p.m. and no after-hours visitors would be allowed.
   The decision scuttled a plan to entertain visitors Tuesday night
with stories and traditional Indian dances.
   The group agreed to stay in another Hermitage-owned field away
from the front gate, but Quick said he has asked for a meeting with
Gov. Ned McWherter to discuss state cooperation with the project.
   Fletch Coke, regent of the Ladies Hermitage Association, said
the problem was with miscommunication over the details of the visit.
   ``We tried to make them welcome for this historic event,'' she
said Wednesday. ``They brought much more than just three wagons.
There were campers and horse trailers.''
   Luvenia Butler, executive director of the Tennessee Indian
Commission, said she worked with the Hermitage to find a suitable
campsite.
   ``The Hermitage people were so nice. They found another nice
meadow and we relocated them there. It worked out fine. A man from
Nashville donated food to them,'' she said.
   Quick said the party has endured rigorous conditions since
leaving Red Clay Historical State Park Sept. 17. The journey is
scheduled to end in Tahlequah, Okla., in early December.
   ``We've slept in chicken yards and on mountain tops. Tennessee's
been a hard time,'' Quick said. ``The people have been nice, but
the setups have been bad.''
   The wagon train was to stay at a horse riding club Wednesday
night, the Robertson County Fairgrounds on Thursday night and a
campground on Friday.

   Yuri Churbanov, son-in-law of the late President
Leonid I. Brezhnev, refused Tuesday to testify further in his
corruption trial and got into a courtroom argument with a
prosecutor, Tass reported.
   On Monday, the 51-year-old Churbanov had outlined his response
to charges that he accepted bribes as one of the country's top
police officials, a first deputy interior minister, during
Brezhnev's rule.
   ``You have my written testimony and you're well familiar with
it, so I'm not going to repeat anything,'' the official Soviet news
agency quoted Churbanov as saying in court Tuesday.
   ``I already refused to answer this question yesterday and I
won't answer it today either.''
   Churbanov, husband of Brezhnev's daughter Galina, took the
witness stand Monday for the first time in the trial, now in its
fourth week, and testified that he kept a $160,000 bribe because it
would have been too awkward to return.
   Churbanov is standing trial before a military tribunal with
eight others, all former police officials in the Central Asian
republic of Uzbekistan. The case is expected to last several more
weeks. Churbanov is accused of accepting a total of $1.1 million in
bribes and of abusing his office.
   He could be put before a firing squad if found guilty.
   At one point Tuesday, Tass reported, Churbanov told the
prosecutor in reply to a question: ``So you and I started an
incomprehensible altercation again.''
   Judge Mikhail Marov interrupted to say: ``Nobody is going to
allow you, Churbanov, to altercate. Don't forget you're in the
dock.''
   Tass did not say what questions were asked of Churbanov.
   His lawyer, Andrei Makarov, said Churbanov's refusal to answer
questions was within his legal rights.
   ``He categorically denies any bribe-taking, although he admits
having received significant sums of money from Uzbekistan's party
leaders,'' Tass quoted Makarov as saying.
   The trial is part of a campaign under Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to expose and correct the corruption and economic slump
that plagued the country under Brezhnev, who ruled from 1964 until
his death in 1982.

   Terrorists set off a bomb by remote
control Wednesday night in an apparent attempt to kill the head of
a Texaco subsidiary as he and his wife passed by in a bulletproof
car, police said.
   Two passersby were hurt, but executive John Buttle and his wife
Betty escaped harm, the Bogota radio station RCN said, quoting
witnesses at the scene.
   The bomb appeared to have been strapped to a fire hydrant and
was set off as the Buttles' Mercedes Benz limousine passed by
slowly in rush hour traffic, police said in a news release.
   The Buttles were on their way home when the bomb exploded about
three blocks from their house, police said. The explosion was near
the intersection of the North Highway with 127th street in northern
Bogota.
   House windows shattered up to three blocks away, witnesses told
RCN.
   Buttle has lived in Colombia more than 20 years. He is president
of Texas Petroleum, a Texaco subsidiairy.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, but
suspicion fell on the National Liberation Army, a guerrilla group
headed by a defrocked Catholic priest. The group has been the most
active of six leftist guerrilla organizations and has targeted
American companies in the last two years.
   Last July the guerrilla group kidnapped Jake Gambini, president
of General Pipe Co., of Houston, at an Occidental Petroleum camp in
Colombia's eastern plains. The group has not made public any
demands for his release.

   A Salvadoran military
helicopter crashed Wednesday during evacuation operations in a
northern war zone, killing all five men aboard, the armed forces
press office said.
   It said the U.S.-made Bell UH-1H helicopter crashed while
evacuating troops from the vicinity of San Francisco Morazan in
Chalatenango province, about 46 miles north of San Salvador. It did
not say what caused the crash.
   The pilot of another Salvadoran air force helicopter was wounded
by rebel fire in northern Chalatenango on Sunday, the army press
office said.
   A broadcast on the guerrillas' clandestine Radio Venceremos on
Tuesday said there was heavy fighting in Chalatenango and accused
the Salvadoran army of the ``indiscriminate bombing'' of a small
town in the province. It did not identify the town.
   The broadcast said rebel forces inflicted 22 casualties on
government troops Sept. 21-26. It did not say if there were any
rebel casualties.
   Marxist-led guerrillas have waged a 9-year-old war against the
U.S.-backed government.
   Wednesday's crash was the second this year of an army
helicopter. In January, a UH-1H helicopter crashed near San Jose
Guayabal, about 15 miles north of the capital, killing three men
aboard.
   The press office identified the dead as Lt. Oscar Arturo Monge
Vides, the helicopter pilot; Manuel de Jesus Turcios Garcia, the
co-pilot and a cadet; two artillery soldiers and an army medic.
   Also Wednesday, the armed forces press office reported that
rebel forces attacked a sugar mill in central El Salvador, killing
one soldier and wounding another.

   Harrah's sports book said Wednesday it is
refunding outstanding bets on the Olympic 100-meter race, in which
Ben Johnson was disqualified for steroid use, but other Nevada
books honored similar wagers.
   The Canadian top finisher was stripped of his gold medal, which
was given to Carl Lewis of the United States, who finished second.
   ``It didn't seem fair to pay with Johnson as the winner because
he cheated,'' said Joe Bachman, manager of Harrah's Reno sports
book. ``But Carl Lewis didn't win the race either. If Ben Johnson
wasn't in the race, who's to say what would have happened.''
   Mike Rumbolz, chairman of Nevada's Gaming Control Board which
enforces betting laws, said it is up to each sports book whether to
pay off on disqualified winners.
   Several Nevada bookmakers said the Olympic results should be
treated like a horse race in which bettors are paid off for winners
later disqualified.
   ``In horse racing, when a race is run and the results are
declared official at the finish line, that's that. Bettors are paid
off no matter what happens later,'' said Scott Hall, assistant
manager of the Reno Turf Club.
   The Turf Club did not put out a line on the Olympic matchup. The
Hilton and the Aladdin hotel-casinos and Little Caesars sports
books in Las Vegas joined Harrah's in taking bets on the Friday
race, and all three paid off on Johnson, as did books in London.
   ``We paid off on Johnson because, let me ask you, `who won the
race?,''' said Gene Mayday, manager of Little Caesars. ``Johnson
did. We didn't ask whether he took drugs or not. It doesn't matter.
He crossed the finish line first.''
   ``For betting purposes, Johnson was the winner, is the winner
and will be the winner,'' agreed Art Manteris, director of the Las
Vegas Hilton sports book.
   Bachman said less than $10,000 was bet on the two men at
Harrah's with most of the money on Lewis at 5 to 6 odds. The line
on Johnson was 11 to 10 and was 3 to 1 on any one else in the
100-meter race.
   Odds of 5 to 6 would pay off $5 for each $6 bet, plus the amount
of the wager.
   Half of the Johnson bettors were paid off before Harrah's
decided on the refund, but Bachman would not say how much money
that involved.
   ``We just lost in the deal because we paid off some bets and
then we had to refund, too,'' he said.
   In the future, Harrah's probably will inform bettors at the
window that the winner at the finish line will be paid off, Bachman
said.

   Discovery's five astronauts, anxious
to break an agonizing 32-month drought in American spaceflight,
were ``elated to be headed for space'' Wednesday as the overnight
countdown began for a Thursday midmorning launch.
   NASA officials were admittedly nervous, but confident. ``The
space shuttle is ready to fly,'' said shuttle administrator Richard
Truly, adding, ``Even the weather is looking good.''
   Late Wednesday night, Air Force weather spokesman Mike Beeman
estimated there was a 90 percent chance the weather would permit a
launch Thursday. But he said winds that were currently 10 knots out
of the north were expected to shift to east-northeast by morning,
which would blow across the landing runway. Launch criteria allows
no more than a 12-knot crosswind, in case the orbiter must return
for an emergency landing.
   ``We're real concerned about what those winds are going to do
tomorrow morning,'' Beeman said. ``It's something we're watching
real, real closely.''
   The ship, obscured for weeks behind a giant scaffold, stood in
full view after NASA retracted the structure. The process took
place hours early, so ``workers will have a head start'' on final
countdown procedures. The count resumed at midevening Wednesday
after a daylong, scheduled hold.
   Fueling was to begin at about 1:40 a.m. EDT, with the craft
bathed in brilliant spotlights.
   ``This has been a long 2{ years,'' Truly said of the difficult
period since the Challenger accident in 1986. Liftoff was scheduled
for 9:59 a.m. EDT, with a 2{-hour window to take care of weather or
technical delays.
   After launch officials gave preliminary go-ahead for overnight
fueling of Discovery, Truly passed the news to Frederick H. Hauck,
the shuttle commander. ``The best way to describe him is elated to
be headed for space,'' Truly told reporters.
   The crew studied updated flight plans and received weather
briefings before an early bedtime.
   Around the Kennedy Space Center area, excitement was mounting.
Campers and recreation vehicles found good viewing places across
the Indian River. Souvenir sellers set up shop. NASA's Visitor's
Center sold out of the commemorative envelopes that feature the
crew patch.
   NASA's deputy administrator Dale Myers exulted that ``we have
been working 2{ years to put the shuttle back in business and
tomorrow is the day we plan to do that.'' He said ``it's really the
beginning of the future for our space program.''
   Arnold Aldrich, director of the shuttle program said,
jubilantly, ``tomorrow the shuttle should return to its proper
place in the sky and launch us into a new era.''
   Hauck and his four-man crew had an easy day, relaxing at the
crew quarters seven miles from launch pad 39B. Their wives were
there, too.
   They were to be awakened at 5 a.m., for breakfast, a last-minute
weather briefing, and time to get into their cumbersome flight
suits.
   The four-day Discovery mission will be the first shuttle flight
since Challenger exploded in a fireball 73 seconds after liftoff
from the same launch pad on Jan. 28, 1986. The accident ceded
manned space to the Soviet Union, which has put 16 cosmonauts into
orbit since then, aboard six flights.
   Asked what would be going through his mind as the count ticks
down, the center's deputy director, Tom Utsman, said, ``I'll be
saying that hopefully we have done all the right things, that we
haven't taken any shortcuts, that we haven't overlooked anything.
   ``I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't nervous,'' he said. ``But I
also am confident.''
   As a result of investigations since the accident, the shuttle
fleet and NASA's management have undergone major changes. The
shuttle itself has had 210 modifications, including the addition of
an escape system that would enable the crew to bail out if the ship
had to ditch in the ocean. The escape system would not have saved
the Challenger crew.
   The shuttle booster rockets, blamed for the Challenger tragedy,
have undergone an $800 million redesign.
   Because of the many changes, Hauck said the mission is
considered a test flight. ``We'll probably see some surprises, but
I don't think they'll be life-threatening surprises,'' he said.
   Many astronauts and NASA officials have been immensely
frustrated with the time it took to fly the shuttle again. After
three Apollo astronauts were killed in a launch pad test in 1967,
NASA was flying again within 21 months and on the moon nine months
after that.
   Mission specialist John M. Lounge, one of the Discovery
astronauts, said ``the worst thing you can do to an airplane is put
it in a hangar for three years and make a lot of changes. When you
bring that airplane back, the first thing you do is a test flight
to wring out every system and find the surprises. I expect we'll
see some. But I'm satisfied all the changes are necessary and that
we'll have a safer vehicle.''
   Lounge and Hauck's colleagues on the flight are pilot Richard O.
Covey, and mission specialists David C. Hilmers and George D.
Nelson.
   America's space future could depend on a safe mission.
   ``We have to be successful,'' said Kennedy Space Center
director, Forrest McCartney. ``The nation could not withstand
another accident like Challenger.''
   ``You can't totally take the risk out of something like this,''
McCartney said in an interview. ``But in those last hours of the
count I'll know that we have done everything we know how to make
this a safe flight, that we have reduced the risks as much as we
possibly can.''
   Two problems that surfaced in recent days appeared to be
resolved.
   One had to do with a booster rocket being readied for a twin of
the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite the Discovery crew is to
launch six hours after liftoff. A cut on a small sealing O-ring on
the booster rocket, destined for flight next February, was found to
have a tiny cut _ apparently caused by a metal burr.
   Engineers worked overnight and said tests of rings deliberately
flawed showed they would not leak. The cut apparently was inflicted
during installation and does not represent a design or
manufacturing defect, the engineers said.
   The other snag involved the scraping off of a layer of paint on
one of Discovery's small jet thrusters used to position the shuttle
in orbit. But it was found that underlayers of the thermal paint
were intact, and that the thruster could be bypassed if need be.

   The bulky orange pressure suits are
far less comfortable than the coveralls shuttle crews once wore _
and they take forever to put on. But they could be lifesavers for
Discovery's astronauts.
   The 75-pound suits, never before worn into space, are to be worn
only during takeoff and landing and come packed with parachutes,
lifeboats and radios. They are part of a new escape system,
including a telescoping pole and an escape hatch, that was devised
in the aftermath of Challenger, although it would not have helped
in the disaster that killed seven astronauts.
   ``It's not a very comfortable thing to walk around in, but it's
got a lot of capabilities,'' said Roly Rice, project engineer for
the escape system at NASA's Johnson Space Center.

   A Senate tax bill that for two years has been
gathering everything but momentum is now hung up over fears that
President Reagan will accuse its backers of favoring higher taxes.
   In comparison with the giant 1986 tax overhaul legislation,
which shifted $125 billion in taxes from individuals to
corporations over five years, this bill is peanuts, with a
three-year price tag of $2.3 billion.
   It was launched in the summer of 1986 just to correct errors and
clear up ambiguities in the new tax law. It since has become the
vehicle for dozens of other tax provisions whose beneficiaries
include farmers, workers who receive education assistance from
their employers, and taxpayers involved in disputes with the
Internal Revenue Service.

   For those accustomed to turgid Soviet
speeches on Marxist theory, class struggle, imperialism, oppression
of the Third World and East-West confrontation, it was a revolution.
   When Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze took the rostrum at
the 43rd U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, he sounded more pacific,
pragmatic, and ecologically sensitive than Soviet officials have
sounded for years.
   Who ever thought of the ozone layer as a major Soviet concern?
If one closed his eyes and listened to the English-language
translation, one might not have recognized the Kremlin's top
foreign policy spokesman.
   Shevardnadze proclaimed ``our vision of peaceful coexistence as
the universal principle of international relations.'' Class
struggle in the international arena is out, he said, and ideology
is not a practical basis for conducting international relations.

   After watching crops shrivel in the
summer and harvests shrink in the fall, farmers have another
drought worry before next spring's planting: erosion.
   ``Each little raindrop is like a little bomb,'' said James
Pingry, a U.S. Soil Conservation Service agronomist.
   ``Anywhere there's been drought the risk of erosion is
greater,'' said Scott Argabright, an agronomist at the Soil
Conservation Service's Midwest National Technological Center in
Lincoln, Neb.
   In Iowa, conservationists said Tuesday the record pace of corn
and soybean harvests by farmers trying to prevent further crop
damage will only accelerate fall plowing and other fieldwork to
prepare for next spring.
   Stripping away the residue of the last crop and turning the dirt
over always has the risk that wind and water erosion will carry off
exposed topsoil.

   Much of Love Canal has been declared
safe for resettlement, and Nunzio LoVerdi, who spent years trying
to stay in the neighborhood that became synonymous with chemical
contamination, vowed to be the first back.
   ``Your home is your home no matter what happens to it,'' LoVerdi
said Tuesday. ``I'm going back.''
   State health officials announced Tuesday that hundreds of former
Love Canal residents may return to the homes they left after the
neighborhood was declared a disaster by President Jimmy Carter 10
years ago. Up to 80 other families were hoping the study would
confirm their decision to stay in their homes near the former
chemical dump site.

   Air Force ``pararescue
jumpers'' will be on alert Thursday across the Atlantic Ocean from
Cape Canaveral, ready to help rescue the Discovery astronauts
should they need to use the space shuttle's new escape system.
   Eighteen of the so-called ``PJs'' were dispatched last Wednesday
from here to Gambia and Morocco on Africa's northwest coast. They
are members of the 1730th Pararescue Squadron, the only unit in the
U.S. military dedicated solely to rescue work.
   Nine jumpers from the New York Air National Guard are stationed
at Patrick Air Force Base near Cape Canaveral to provide rescue
assistance should the astronauts bail out of the shuttle closer to
Florida than to Africa. Also working out of Patrick are 18 other
PJs aboard rescue helicopters.

   Private economists reacted with skepticism
Wednesday to George Bush's proposal for new tax-deferred savings
accounts for the middle class.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis was already using the proposal as
ammunition for his contention that a Bush presidency would favor
the rich. However, Republican Bush defended his plan to set up
``individual savings accounts,'' saying they would ``give taxpayers
a little nest egg.''
   Many private economists called the tax savings inconsequential
and said it was unlikely such accounts would be used by very many
Americans.

withdrawal from the embattled country.
   Charging Pakistan and, indirectly, the United States with
violating the Geneva accords, the Soviet Union turned to the U.N.
Security Council to resolve the dispute.
   While State Department officials in Washington said they
expected the troop withdrawal to be completed by Feb. 15, as
specified in the accords signed last April, a Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman suggested a slowdown.

   The Communist Party's policy-making body will meet
Friday to overhaul the country's political structure and make
high-level leadership changes, Soviet officials said.
   The plenary session of the 300-member Central Committee had been
expected by October to discuss amendments to the Constitution and
expanding elections with multiple candidates.
   The changes are key to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's goal
of taking the 20 million-member Communist Party out of the
day-to-day management of the economy and having it focus on
ideology and policy goals.

   A top-to-bottom reorganization of physician fees,
requested by Congress, could raise the pay of general practitioners
by 70 percent while cutting some surgeons' income in half, its
author said.
   If adopted by private and government insurance programs, the
long-awaited plan would sharply increase the pay for office visits
while reducing fees for surgery and other procedures, such as
installing pacemakers.
   The plan's architect, economist William C. Hsiao of the Harvard
School of Public Health, contends the current system is
``unworkable and unfair,'' short-changing doctors for day-to-day
management of their patients while paying them far too much for
exotic tests and other highly technical work.

<HEAD>Episcopalians Often Have Won Presidency, But So Far, No Greek
Orthodox</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If George Bush becomes president, he would be
the 12th Episcopalian to hold that office, more than of any other
denomination. If Michael Dukakis wins, he would be the first Greek
Orthodox in the Oval Office.
   Both are lifelong members of their faiths.
   A regular church-goer, Bush is a member of St. Martin's
Episcopal Church in Houston. He also is a close friend of
evangelist Billy Graham, who spends time with Bush each year at his
summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   There, Bush is a vestrymen at St. Anne's Episcopal Church, as
well as maintaining active participation in the Houston
congregation. In Washington, he attends various Episcopal churches,
including the National Cathedral.
   In his family, faith was a ``given,'' he writes. ``God just was,
there was no debate about it.''
   Dukakis is a lifelong member of Annunication Cathedral in
Boston, a regular contributor and frequent worshipper there,
attending on major holidays and sometimes on Sundays.
   ``He comes as often or more often than some other members,''
says the cathedral dean, the Rev. Athanasian Demos. ``It's not as
often as I wish. I'd like everyone to be here every Sunday.''
   Under church rules, Dukakis is formally barred from taking
Communion because of his marriage to a non-Christian _ his wife
Kitty is a Jew _ but this is regarded a pastoral issue between
worshipper and priest.
   George Stephanopoulos, a Boston spokesman for Dukakis, says,
``The governor considers himself a religious man and close to the
church. Religion is not something he takes lightly.''
   He is a personal friend of Archbishop Iakovos, primate of Greek
Orthodoxy in the Americas. Iakovos had been pastor of the Boston
cathedral when Dukakis was a lad in Sunday school and his parents
were active members.
   The archbishop, whom Dukakis calls his ``spiritual father,'' has
often counseled with him over the years and met and prayed with him
since he began his campaign for the presidency.
   His wife, who does not attend services with him, recently told
the Atlanta Jewish Times:
   ``We have mutual respect for the other in terms of the right and
privilege to practice their religion as they see fit, and we've
done that.
   ``I think I'm a stronger Jew for having married out of my
religion. I feel very strongly about my ethnic and religious
background, and that has not diminished.
   ``Michael feels very strongly about his religious background,
and we made a decision before we were married that we would raise
our children with both.'' They ``have shared in the richness of
both our heritages.''
   Dukakis has drawn occasional jabs from within Orthodoxy for not
condemning abortion and for his marriage to a Jew. He was called an
``apostate'' by Republican policy analyst James G. Jatras, a Greek
Orthodox.
   However, the Greek Orthodox community generally has seemed
widely supportive of Dukakis. The archbishop, while refraining from
political endorsements, has strongly affirmed Dukakis' steady
churchmanship.
   The candidate has encountered opposition and frequent picking by
anti-abortion forces. Like many other politicians, he says he
personally opposes abortion but doesn't want to impose that
position on others.
   He also has opposed tuition tax credits for students in private
or religious schools, and is against capital punishment.
   Bush, on the other hand, favors capital punishment and tuition
tax credits, and would outlaw abortion except to save the life of
the mother or in cases of rape or incest.
   He also wants daily prayer in the public schools, and required
recital of the Pledge of Allegiance.
   These positions have gained him strong support from some
evangelicals including Moral Majority chairman Jerry Falwell.
   After a meeting with a group of evangelical leaders in July,
former Southern Baptist President Adrian Rogers of Memphis, Tenn.,
said, ``I appreciate very much the Bush campaign reaching out to
evangelicals.''
   However, prior to the current campaign, Bush at times has
criticized some fundamentalists for trying to ``impose their will
and dictate their own interpretation of morality on the rest of
society.''
   Once, when pressed by an evangelical interviewer about whether
he has had a ``born-again'' conversion experience, he said, ``Yes,
I believe in Jesus and I have accepted him as my personal savior.''
   However, he expressed annoyance at those who demand that all
Christians must know the exact day and hour their conversion
occurred.
   Of the nation's 38 presidents to date, 11 have been
Episcopalians, six Presbyterians, four Methodists, three
Congregationalists (now United Church of Christ), two Unitarians,
two Dutch Reformed, two Baptists, two Quakers, two of the Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ), and one Roman Catholic.
   Two, including one of the most deeply religious presidents of
American history, Abraham Lincoln, and the man who succeeded him
after his assassination, Andrew Johnson, never affiliated with any
denomination.

   Can a private university save a failing urban
school district? Boston University has offered to try to do just
that for Chelsea, Mass., perhaps that state's worst school system,
within a decade. The proposal has raised hopes in this
immigrant-rich city, but some question the wisdom of surrendering
control of public schools to a private institution.

   Like the four other schools in this most
troubled district in Massachusetts, Burke Elementary is awaiting
its messiah. If the savior arrives this fall, it won't be a moment
too soon.
   Children in this overcrowded, 107-year-old, red brick and wood
school eat at their desks. There is no cafeteria. The playground is
unsafe because slate slides off the roof. The wooden stairs are a
blatant fire hazard. What passes for an auditorium contains what
passes for a library and what passes for a speech therapy room.
   Test scores, graduation rates and teacher salaries all rank
among the worst in the state. This impoverished district on Boston
Harbor that mixes Hispanic and Southeast Asian immigrants with
working-class whites spends just $2,600 per pupil. That's about
$1,600 less than the national average and only $200 more than
Arkansas, the lowest spending state.
   Fifty-nine percent of the district's 3,300 schoolchildren come
from families where English is a second language, if spoken at all,
says Superintendent Frank Herlihy.
   Chelsea hasn't built a new school since 1923, and buildings like
Burke are completely inadequate in 1988.
   Five miles away, John Silber, sharp-tongued president of Boston
University, says he can change all that _ and gain prestige for his
school in the bargain. He has offered to manage the Chelsea school
district for 10 years and transform it into a model for urban
school renewal.
   If Silber has his way, his university would administer and
finance a sort of Marshall Plan for Chelsea schools. Mothers and
pregnant teens would be counseled on nutrition and child rearing.
Curricula would be revamped. New schools would be built, old ones
renovated. Learning plans would be tailored to individual students.
There would be after-school programs for all ages.
   If Silber achieves even a fraction of this, it would be a
national first: a private university governing a public school
system, a full-scale social experiment aimed at transforming the
fortunes of an entire downtrodden community from birth to old age.
   ``I don't think it's extraneous to the life of a university to
be caught serving the community,'' Silber said in an interview.
``We'll be making good on a lot of palaver, a lot of talk that
comes out of Washington. Actions continue to speak louder than
words.''
   Many in Chelsea are thrilled at the prospect of a helping hand.
But others, especially teachers, are bitter and mistrustful
because, they say, university officials only recently saw fit to
include them in discussions.
   Still others question whether it's right for a city to grant
control of its schools to a private body, no matter how
well-intentioned.
   ``I don't think the school committee should turn over its
authority to any private institution. Isn't that what democracy is
about?'' said Elizabeth McBride, a member of the Chelsea school
committee.
   In other words, big questions remain before the BU-Chelsea
contract is a done deal. Where is the money coming from for BU's
grandiose reform plan? Who would ultimately be in charge?
   ``Concretely and specifically, nothing has been settled. There
is no contract between Chelsea and BU,'' said Paul Devlin, head of
the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers.
   It began three years ago when 30-year veteran school
committeeman Andrew P. Quigley independently approached Silber with
the idea of managing Chelsea's schools. The university agreed to
produce a comprehensive audit of the schools and develop a plan to
revive the system.
   The district's biggest problem has always been money, but 1980's
statewide tax-limiting Proposition 2{ hit Chelsea hard. Funds for
supplies were cut in half, and music, art, physical education and
counseling staff were laid off.
   Said Ed Greenberg, a 73-year-old retiree and civic leader who
recently attended his 55th Chelsea High School reunion: ``The
community just doesn't have the money or the expertise to turn the
schools around. This has been going on for 30 years now. Things are
bad. Things are bad.''
   In a 231-page proposal issued last summer, BU offered a
messianic vision of Chelsea schools 10 years from now, with BU at
the helm:
   _ Chelsea schools would boast ``Family Learning Centers''
addressing the education, health and nutrition needs of parents and
children alike, from birth to adulthood.
   _ Curricula from kindergarten through 12th grade would be
overhauled the first year, and teachers would design individual
learning plans for students.
   _ Community service would be a graduation requirement. Working
with the city health department, students, parents and city leaders
would end Chelsea's drug problems.
   _ Teacher pay, currently lowest in the state at
$18,000-to-$30,000, would be made competitive, with incentive pay
and added responsibilities for the best teachers.
   By the fifth year, BU projects a 20 percent improvement in
third-grade reading, writing and math test scores. The dropout rate
will be down to 10 percent from the current 15 percent. The
elementary schools will be freshly renovated, a new high school
ready for students.

   Currently, the BU-Chelsea relationship is defined by a set of
resolutions adopted by the school committee July 26, in essence an
agreement committing both sides to work in good faith toward a
final contract.
   The key difference between the town and the university lies in
who would run the schools. The plan the university submitted in
June proposed setting up a five-member management committee with BU
holding a 3-2 majority. The Chelsea school committee countered with
a proposal that the management team consist of the existing
seven-member school committee and three BU representatives.
   Peter R. Greer, who this summer became dean of BU's school of
education, proposed a compromise Sept. 21, giving the Chelsea
school committee power to override BU's management decisions with a
two-thirds vote. He also suggested an advisory council be set up
with parents, teachers and townspeople passing along concerns to
the university managers.
   If Chelsea endorses that plan, the Legislature must still
approve a transfer of power from the community to the university;
chances are considered good.
   Beyond those uncertainties is a residue of resentment among some
school committeemen and classroom teachers who contend that, until
very recently, the university had dealt with them high-handedly.
   ``When the BU people first came in here, it felt like a grand
jury, with rapid-fire questions,'' said Richard Denning, principal
of Prattville School, another of Chelsea's antiquated elementary
schools. ``BU is going to find that it's more difficult than it
appears. From my point of view, we need help, but not a takeover.''
   ``The only time I've seen BU people was a 15-second walk through
my classroom,'' said Christine Siewko, a veteran first-grade
teacher at Burke. ``I feel if they're going to do a decent job
there, they are going to need teacher input.''
   ``BU is biting off more than it realizes,'' said Phyllis
Nazzaro, the lead teacher of special education at Chelsea High
School. ``We have PTA meetings and only four or five parents show
up. We know the problems.''
   Even Greer, who won high marks as school superintendent in
Portland, Maine, in 1979-86 and served as a federal undersecretary
of education for two years before joining BU, acknowledges the
university could have better explained its plans.
   Greer has promised to involve teachers and parents more in
discussions, and both sides say he's already soothed some of the
hurt feelings.
   Still, these questions remain:
   _ Where is the money coming from?
   Silber says he's confident he can get the Legislature and
private foundations to donate the $50 million he estimates is
needed to build new schools and renovate existing ones, and an
additional $2 million or so a year to raise salaries and meet other
operating costs of the plan.
   ``When John Silber walks into the Ford Foundation, we know they
are going to listen,'' Quigley said.
   So far, said Greer, the university has gotten a commitment only
from Papa Gino's pizza chain to supply free pies for good students,
and $10,000 from a Minneapolis firm to help refine the district's
computer network.
   _ Who would be in charge?
   Greer, despite his proposal to give the school committee power
to override university decisions, makes it clear the university
expects the upper hand.
   ``BU shouldn't be asked to put its reputation and resources on
the line and not have a certain authority,'' he said.
   Silber bristles at suggestions that the university wants to
``take over'' Chelsea's schools.
   The existing school committee, he insisted, ``will continue to
have a supervisory role, an evaluative role, a consultative role.
And if they decide that we're not doing the job right, they can
fire us.''
   BU has also stated it would assume the role as collective
bargaining agent. Said Donald Menzies, president of the Chelsea
Teachers Union, ``We, of course, will take a long hard look at
that.''
   Silber has tried with mixed success to quell teachers' concerns.
He insists that teachers and parents would be in the thick of any
decisions to change curricula or classroom life.
   ``It doesn't mean that because BU is involved that therefore
`Comandante Silber' is going to say this is the way it's going to
be,'' he said. ``We're not stupid. We know perfectly well that if
we designed a curriculum in which you've had no part that you won't
teach it. You can't make a teacher teach anything. But if they've
had a hand in its development, they'll want a hand in its
realization.''
   Can BU succeed?
   Personalities could play a decisive role.
   Silber is admired for raising the stature of Boston University,
but is viewed with trepidation by some teachers because of his
often stormy relations with his own faculty and his abrasive
dealings with campus labor unions.
   Greer may be the key. In Portland, he earned a reputation as a
first-class educator and skilled negotiator who welcomed community
involvement.
   ``With Greer, BU is finally starting to listen to us,'' said
teacher union head Menzies.

   Andrew Robinson is usually eager to get back
to real life after completing an acting role.
   He was the psychotic killer in ``Dirty Harry.'' He was convicted
killer Jack Abbott in the stage play ``In the Belly of the Beast.''
   ``When I play somebody like that, it's wonderful to get back,''
said Robinson. But now, having just completed the most strenuous
role of his life, he's a little reluctant to let go.
   He stars in the title role of ABC's ``Liberace,'' which is being
billed as the ``authorized'' version of the life of the late master
showman. Liberace, noted for his glitzy costumes, flaymboyant
lifestyle and candelabra-lit concerts, died of complications
related to AIDS in 1987.
   ``Doing the story of Liberace was like being in fantasyland for
four weeks,'' Robinson said. ``But you have to come back to real
life.''
   He is holding out until tonight, when he goes back to Las Vegas
for the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Liberace Museum. ``I
couldn't miss that, now that I've worn half of the clothing going
into it,'' he said. ``That's my swan song to the whole thing.''

   If you're in the same position as most consumer
borrowers, financial advisers say, you should be aware that time is
not on your side.
   In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a real incentive to
borrow heavily. Since inflation was running at a rapid rate, you
paid off loans with cheaper and cheaper dollars as time passed.
   And every nickel of interest you paid was deductible on your tax
return, no matter what you used the money for.
   But those days are long gone. Interest rates, though they may be
nominally lower now than they were several years ago, are actually
very high in comparison to today's inflation rate.
   And the deduction for consumer interest _ on credit-card
purchases, auto loans and so forth _ is fast disappearing.
   Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, just 40 percent of consumer
interest will be deductible on 1988 tax returns.
   The percentage drops to 20 in 1989, to 10 in 1990, and to zero
thereafter.
   ``If you have not already done so, you should consider repaying
existing personal debts as soon as possible to avoid additional
non-deductible interest expense,'' the accounting firm of KPMG Peat
Marwick says in a booklet on 1988 yearend tax planning.
   That goes especially for credit-card debt, analysts say.
   In some areas of the country, competition between lenders has
pushed interest rates on outstanding credit-card balances down from
their former levels. But according to the organization Bank Card
Holders of America, the average rate still stands at 18.3 percent.
   If you have some money you want to invest for an assured high
return, suggests the financial advisory Donoghue's Money Letter,
what better use for it than to pay off credit card debt?
   ``We dare you to find another 18.3 percent sure thing today,''
the newsletter says. ``It just doesn't make sense to pay this kind
of interest.''
   A special problem can arise with a car loan, adds Jerry Karbon
of the Credit Union National Association, a trade group in Madison,
Wis.
   Since many cars are bought today with loans extending over five,
six or even seven years, their owners often face an unpleasant
surprise when they prepare to trade them in for new models.
   The car's value has depreciated as fast as, or faster than, the
loan balance has been reduced, so that the vehicle has no effective
trade-in value.
   ``Paying for the car over a longer period reduces the monthly
payment, but it repays the loan so slowly that it may take three
years or more before there is any positive equity in the vehicle,''
Karbon says.
   ``The time-honored way to save money on loans still applies. Aim
for the highest monthly payment you can afford and the shortest
repayment time.
   ``In the case of auto loans, it will pay off on your next
purchase as well'' by increasing the net value of your trade-in, he
says.
   The Donoghue organization even goes so far as to suggest paying
off your mortgage faster than the loan agreement calls for, if you
can manage to do so.
   On most mortgages and other debts secured by a home, the
interest you pay remains fully deductible. Nevertheless, if you can
work out an accelerated payment schedule with the lender, the
newsletter points out, you can save yourself a lot of interest
expense and increase your equity in your home.
   That equity becomes an asset you can tap some time in the future
_ for instance, to pay for children's college tuition.
   As the Donoghue analysts say, ``the more equity you have in your
home, the more useful a home equity loan will be.''

unusual investigative and legal maneuvering in a 1986-87 case in
which document forger Mark Hoffman got off with a plea-bargained
sentence of five years to life in prison after committing two

   Based on months of interviews in the wake of the strange case in
which Mormon Hoffman sold ingeniously faked documents that
embarrassed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

<HEAD>Legacy of Human Rights Abuse in Marcos Years Haunts Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two years after President
Corazon Aquino took office with a vow to protect human rights, her
government has yet to shake off the legacy of repressive rule left
by the exiled Ferdinand E. Marcos.
   Officials say the campaign to end abuses and build confidence
among the public has been hampered by a widespread distrust of
government in the wake of 20 years of Marcos rule.
   ``It's a carry-over mentality,'' said Abelardo Aportadera of the
Human Rights Commission. ``Whenever you have government
investigating, you always hesitate.''
   Reliable figures on human rights violations during Marcos' time
and during Mrs. Aquino's years are virtually impossible to
determine because of differences in definition, poor record-keeping
and varying standards used by both the government and private
groups for confirming allegations.
   But criticism of the Aquino government's human rights record has
come not only from social activists and leftists but also from the
hierarchy of the influential Roman Catholic Church.
   In a stinging commentary in August, the country's bishops
appealed for ``more discipline'' in the military and for the
disbanding of vigilante groups established by the armed forces to
help fight communist guerrillas.
   Amnesty International and the International Commission of
Jurists have also expressed concern over unresolved human rights
violations under the Aquino administration. Both organizations have
cited an increasing number of unsolved killings of human rights
workers.
   In a report this year, another group, the church-backed Task
Force Detainees, claimed the number of human rights violations in
1987 equaled or surpassed those for 1985, Marcos' last full year in
power.
   Augusto Catelo, chief of the Human Rights Commission's records
division, said 2,016 cases have been filed since the commission was
established by Mrs. Aquino in March 1986.
   He said the figure includes cases such as financial claims from
private companies, which have been re-classified as non-human
rights cases but have yet to be stricken from the original list of
civil liberties abuses.
   But human rights groups say the government's figures are too
low. The Task Force claims that in 1987 alone, 7,444 people were
arrested without warrants. It said an additional 602 people were
tortured and that 284 people were killed or wounded in 29
``massacres'' of civilians by vigilantes, the military or armed,
private security forces.
   More than 18,000 families were forced from their homes, the Task
Force said. By comparison, the Task Force said, 7,253 people were
arrested illegally and 236 families were forced from their homes in
1985.
   The Task Force added, however, that the number of those slain by
security forces had declined sharply since Mrs. Aquino took office.
   Aportadera says differences in data-gathering methods were
behind the discrepancy. He also claimed the Task Force and other
human rights groups are quick to label reported abuses as
``violations'' without confirmation.
   ``For them, a mere report with some minimum requirement will
already be a violation of human rights,'' he said. ``In our case,
no. ... (If) there's a report of massacre, help us get the data,
the numbers, and then we put it in our file.
   ``I think it is still not that grave, the situation before and
now. I think now what is positive is we are getting cooperation
from the military and police. They are more receptive now to
integrating human rights values in the armed forces.''
   Despite government efforts to educate soldiers on human rights,
officials say, some still abuse civilians, including those
suspected of links to the New People's Army, the communist
guerrilla organization.
   Major abuses include the killing of 13 protesters at a land
reform march in Manila in January 1987, the massacre of 17
civilians in Lupao the following month and unsolved slayings of
prominent leftists, including Rolando Olalia in 1986 and Leandro
Alejandro in September 1987.
   The government's inability so far to identify or prosecute
suspects in those incidents has tarnished the reputation not only
of the Human Rights Commission but also of the country's entire
legal establishment.
   Mrs. Aquino's order for the commission to investigate human
rights violations by guerrillas as well as by soldiers has
reinforced doubts on whether the agency can serve its purpose.
   Critics of the policy say the rebels commit atrocities but
believe the commission should focus its attention on violations by
the military, police and others charged with protecting the
citizenry.
   ``Personally, human rights violations can only be committed by
government,'' said Aportadera. ``In the context of international
human rights, these atrocities that (communist rebels) commit are
crimes, common crimes falling under the purview of rebellion.''
   So far, the commission has completed the investigation of 218
cases, which were referred to the courts. In a partial review of
the agency's records, however, Aportadera says he has found only
one soldier who has been punished for a maltreatment and torture
case.
   ``The element of distrust is there,'' Aportadera said. ``You
still have some elements within government that continue the
practices of Marcos.''

   KOPKAMTIB was abolished recently by a
KEPPRES, which created BAKORSTANAS to take its place.
   The acronym _ some would call it alphabet soup _ is alive and
kicking in Indonesia. What happened recently, in translation from
Indonesian acronymania, is this:
   The Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and
Order (KOPKAMTIB, or Komando Operasi Pemulihan Keamanan Dan
Ketertiban) was abolished by a presidential decree (KEPPRES, or
keputusan president), which created in its place the Coordinating
Agency for Assisting the Strengthening of National Stability
(BAKORSTANAS, or Badan Koordinasi Bantuan Pemantapan Stabilitas
Nasional).
   Acronyms and abbreviations are a national craze, used to
condense unwieldy phrases but serving in many other cases to
compound confusion.
   For one thing, it is common, if not preferable, to use the first
syllable instead of the first letter of words, as with KEPPRES.
   The main political party is called GOLKAR, which is short for
Golongan Karya and comes out in English as Functional Groups.
   Headline writers delight in the convenience offered by the
thousands of short forms, but to the uninitiated the front pages of
Indonesian newspapers resemble a lexicographer's nightmare.
   Acronyms also are found in telephone books and on the doors of
government offices. Standard dictionaries offer no help.
   Many say the use of acronyms first spread during the
administration (1949-66) of President Sukarno, known familiarly as
Bung Karno, for Brother Sukarno.
   During the Sukarno years, the habit was applied to English
phrases as well as the national tongue, Bahasa Indonesia.
   The term ``neo-colonial imperialism'' was cut to ``necolim.''
   A sports tournament for Third World athletes became known as
Ganefo _ Games of the Newly Emerging Forces.
   Communist China became CINKOM.
   Blame or credit for entrenching linguistic short cuts is usually
pinned on the armed forces, or the abri.
   As early as 1976, Professor Takdir Alisjahbana warned that the
influential military was coining so many acronyms that the standard
of Bahasa Indonesia might deteriorate. He said such usage added
nothing to the stock of new ideas but only increased the burden on
the memory.
   Onemagazine editor cautioned his staff about shortening jaksa
agung (attorney general) to jagung, which means popcorn.
   There are acronyms for most government departments and senior
officials.
   The president's personal assistants are aspri _ short for
``asisten pribadi president.''
   The alphabet soup is sometimes flavored with numbers.
   P3 is what people sometimes call the opposition political group
Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (United Development Party).
   Then there's BP-7 _ Badan Pembinaan Pendidikan Pelaksanaan
Pedoman Penghayatan Dan Pengamalan Pancasila.
   That's the Board for Guidance on the Means of Teaching
Guidelines for the True Interpretation and Implementation of the
State Ideology.

<HEAD>Part III: High Wages, High Costs, Industrial Turnaround</HEAD>
<HEAD>In Massachusetts, Unemployment Is Low, Cost of Living High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE ESPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not so long ago, such Massachusetts communities as
Lowell and Fitchburg were aging, decaying industrial dinosaurs.
Factories were closing, manufacturing parks were empty and downtown
stores were shuttered.
   People had to leave to find work. In Taunton _ the largest
landed city in the state with 50 square miles _ they even had to
leave to find a movie theater.
   Mayor Richard Johnson recalls that things got so bad that
Taunton not only had no theaters, it had no hotel. Unemployment
ballooned to 14 percent.
   The community decline has largely been reversed in a booming
economic turnaround that has revived Massachusetts cities and towns
like Taunton, 35 miles to the south of Boston, Fitchburg to the
west and Lowell to the north.
   ``He started putting people on buses,'' Johnson says of Gov.
Michael Dukakis' personal effort to spark a revival.
   Dukakis claims a large measure of credit for this
``Massachusetts Miracle'' as he campaigns for the White House.
Economists generally applaud his efforts but agree that
circumstances and pure luck have made life better for Rita Pires,
Al Souza, Tom Clark and thousands like them _ even as Dukakis
helped things along.
   ``I was hurting financially,'' said Souza, who was forced into
retirement at age 55 but found work in Taunton's revival. ``I think
he's (Dukakis) done well for this community.''
   But the living isn't so easy for the Parsons and Parhams and
many other blue-collar families who can't afford to buy a home
because the prosperity has sent Boston-area house prices soaring.
Between them, the Parsons, who have three children, make $21,000 a
year. The Parhams earn $35,000.
   ``I feel like it has gone down,'' Terry Parson said of her
standard of living in a state where jobs are so plentiful that
McDonald's is offering $7 an hour. ``I feel I'm going backward.
I've been priced out of the market.''
   The Parham family lives in a high crime area and the parents
worry for the safety of their 7-year-old daughter. ``We have to
stay here until things get a little better for us,'' said Betty
Parham. ``I don't let my kid out unless I take her to the park or
somewhere.'' Although the rate of violent crime in Massachusetts
has dropped and is low among major industrial states, it's no
solace for the Parhams.
   ``It's just unsafe for her to go in front of the door,'' Betty
Parham said of her daughter.
   Harvard economist Ronald F. Ferguson said that while life is
better under Dukakis, it's best for higher income people. ``It's
not that the lower income people don't have jobs, but the cost of
living remains high and it makes it difficult for them to make ends
meet.''
   Economists say Dukakis took advantage of the sudden prosperity
and benefited by association. The Dukakis campaign has been airing
television ads that boast he reversed the state's economic slide.
In one ad, an announcer proclaims:
   ``He turned around a 10-year economic slide and created a boom
that has made Massachusetts one of the hottest economies in the
country. He brought people together, created over 400,000 jobs and
pushed personal income to the highest levels in the nation. He
erased a massive deficit, balanced 10 budgets in a row and cut
taxes five times. It wasn't a miracle, it was leadership.''
   That may be reaching too far. When the state was on the brink of
disaster in the early 1970s with the unemployment rate at more than
11 percent, a loss of more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs in
textiles and apparel and huge budget deficits, no one, not even
Dukakis, knew what forces were at work to change the economy from
rusting low-tech to gleaming hi-tech, according to David Lampe. He
directs the industrial liaison program at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   What happened next, most people agree, had little to do with
Dukakis. The computer industry found the smart people and places
like MIT and Harvard in a state rich with talent and schools.
Commercial banks and venture capitalists were willing to bet on
them. A big market was waiting.
   ``That was the engine of change, the source of new jobs,'' Lampe
said. ``The state had little role in causing the change. No
governor can engineer an economic change as large as the one called
the `Massachusetts Miracle.' It evolved out of the resources in
this region including a concentration of universities and a large
number of defense contracts.''
   Taunton's Mayor Johnson, a Democrat but no ally of Dukakis, says
the governor committed money to link that city to Interstate
Highway 495, a key to its economic recovery. Dukakis, he says,
found companies looking to expand and arranged tours for their
executives.
   One of those executives was John C.C. Fan, a physicist from MIT
who didn't know Dukakis and who had no idea where Taunton was.
Backed by venture capital, Fan, a Chinese immigrant, had just
formed the Kopin Corp., which makes wafers for the electronics
industry.
   ``I don't know how the governor knew I had started the
company,'' said Fan. ``He called me at MIT and asked me to go down
and see him at the Statehouse. He encouraged me to go to Taunton
because of a new industrial park. The financial package was very
attractive.''
   Johnson says the city's industrial park grew from six companies
in 1982 to 52 today, creating 5,000 new jobs that dropped the
unemployment rate to less than 4 percent now.
   Taunton's population grew by 5,000 to nearly 50,000. New tax
revenues allowed the city to invest $6 million in its public
buildings and schools and to replace more than 50 miles of
100-year-old water lines.
   Down the road at Fitchburg, which received state and federal
funds to bring its downtown back to life, Mayor Jeffrey Bean said,
``People seem to be doing much better now than they were 10 years
ago. These grants and programs encouraged business to come into
Massachusetts.''
   Hubert Jones, dean of the School of Social Work at Boston
University, says Dukakis did a good job in increasing state
government contracts to minority organizations and in improving
human services.
   ``Dukakis pumped more money into human services than any other
administration in my memory,'' Jones said. ``Mike Dukakis has been
a good governor the second time around. I think he came back and
corrected some big mistakes.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II is so well-traveled that
the focus has shifted to where he hasn't visited instead of where
he has already stopped.
   Since setting out for the Dominican Republic and Mexico three
months after assuming the papacy 10 years ago, John Paul has made
39 foreign pilgrimages, stopping in 72 countries.
   Easily the most traveled pope in history, he has flown some
370,000 miles, including his trip to southern Africa in
mid-September. That's like traveling from the Earth to the moon and
more than halfway back.
   But if he has visited every continent except Antartica, he has
yet to visit a number of key spots for varying reasons. They
include the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and the Holy Land.
   On the September trip, John Paul was to skirt South Africa on
the five-country pilgrimage but found himself stopping briefly in
the segregated country when bad weather closed in the airport in
Lesotho. The pope said the time wasn't ripe to visit South Africa
but that he wanted to make a regular visit there someday.
   Early in his pontificate, John Paul described himself as a
pilgrim messenger who would travel the world to see his flock. He
has kept his word, far surpassing Pope Paul VI, the first jet age
pontiff who became known as the ``apostle on the move.''
   Paul made nine overseas trips between 1964 and 1970, when, weary
and 72, he halted all foreign travel.
   John Paul has made nine trips to Latin America alone, reflecting
the importance the Vatican attaches to a region expected to contain
half the world's Roman Catholics by the turn of the century.
   He has also paid four visits to Africa, where the church has
been making inroads, as well as three pilgrimages to his native
Poland and two to the United States.
   The trips are central to John Paul's papacy. He has bristled at
suggestions he should spend more time at the Vatican (Vatican
statistics say he is away less than 8 percent of his pontificate)
or that the trips cost too much.
   He chose a bishops conference in Mexico, on his first trip, to
reject Marxist-inspired liberation theology. He influenced the mood
of his fellow Poles during his 1979 pilgrimage that helped lead to
the birth of the Solidarity free trade union, and he expounded
church teaching to Americans in 1987, saying that dissent was
incompatible with being a good Catholic.
   Still to come are a trip later this year to Strasbourg, France,
to address the European Parliament and a visit to Scandinavia next
year.
   John Paul's hopes of visiting the Soviet Union have not yet been
realized. He has disclosed that he's been prevented from visiting
Lithuania, the Roman Catholic stronghold in the Soviet Union, and
insists that he must be allowed to visit with his flock on any
pilgrimage.
   The Holy Land is an especially delicate case. Paul VI made a
whirlwind visit to Israel and Jordan in 1964, but that was three
years before Israel took over predominantly Arab East Jerusalem and
the West Bank in the 1967 war.
   The Vatican has not established diplomatic relations with Israel
and John Paul has stressed that the Palestinians, like the Jews,
have a right to a homeland.
   The Vatican says it is premature for the pope to visit apartheid
South Africa and Communist Cuba. There has been no invitation from
China, which broke relations with the Vatican in 1957 and
established its own breakaway Catholic church.

   Nearly a year after the crash of 1987, Wall
Street is still retrenching and recuperating.
   The growth that doubled the number of jobs in the securities
industry from 1979 to mid-1987 has given way to layoffs, mergers
and cost-cutting.
   Stock prices have staged a modest rally this year, recovering
some of the huge losses they suffered in the slide that culminated
in a record 22.6 percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average
on Black Monday, Oct. 19.
   But the mood and tempo of the marketplace still bear little
resemblance to the bull market that prevailed for five years before
the collapse.
   In a business that thrives on activity _ buying and selling that
generates commissions and trading profits _ volume has lagged all
year. Even short-term plays like stock-index arbitrage and
maneuvers to capture dividends have lately died down.
   If those gimmick transactions and trades between dealers _ most
of which don't bring the Street much revenue _ are excluded, John
Connolly, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., estimates that
volume is down 30 percent or more from a year ago.
   ``Business is contracting,'' he said. ``Mutual fund sales have
stagnated. Pension fund managers are struggling with meager cash
inflows and lots of plan terminations.''
   Some steps have been taken, and others proposed, to strengthen
the mechanism of the marketplace, which was sorely taxed in the
worst moments of the crash.
   For example, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the
organization that operates and regulates the over-the-counter
market, has adopted new systems and rules to keep
computer-to-computer trading going when the pressure on the market
intensifies.
   The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
have come up with plans for ``circuit breakers'' designed to
prevent breakdowns in runaway markets.
   Many observers see measures like these as single pieces in a
larger puzzle still unsolved by the financial community.
   ``The No. 1 issue is to restore investor confidence,'' said
William Schreyer, chairman of Merrill Lynch & Co.
   The crash clearly left a lasting imprint on individual investors
_ the so-called retail customers who were already a diminishing
breed.
   An Opinion Research Corp. survey conducted for the NASD in May
and June found that 39 percent of the respondents had grown more
conservative in their investment strategies.
   More than 60 percent described the stock market as riskier for
individual investors than it was a year earlier.
   The crash brought a sudden halt to more than a decade of rapid
growth for the discount brokerage business, which caters especially
to affluent, knowledgeable individual investors and which depends
heavily on commissions from that clientele.
   In the first quarter of 1988, according to the Securities
Industry Association, Wall Street's main trade group, retail
commissions fell 27 percent from the comparable period a year
earlier.
   If individual investors were frightened by the crash, why didn't
they cut back drastically on their spending, causing a slump in the
consumer economy?
   The answer seems to be that, as a group, they hadn't plunged
heavily into the market before the crash.
   At Merrill Lynch, one of the biggest ``full-service'' firms
catering to the public, Schreyer said only 25 percent of customers'
money was in stocks going into the debacle.
   Assets in those accounts stood at about $250 billion on Sept. 30
of last year, he said. A month later they had fallen to $238
billion, but they since have rebounded to about $260 billion.
   Far more important than individuals as a driving force in the
stock market are money managers at investing institutions, who
handle pension funds and other large pools of assets.
   While investing in stocks or bonds may be optional for an
individual, professional portfolio managers operate in a different
environment. They are paid to put money to work within a relatively
limited range of choices.
   But since the crash, money managers also have been content to
sit with larger-than-usual cash reserves, parked in short-term
interest-bearing investments such as Treasury bills.
   Thanks in part to inflation worries and recent credit tightening
by the Federal Reserve, these low-risk securities now offer yields
of 7.5 to 8 percent or more.
   In strong stock markets, most money managers fear nothing more
than ``underperformance'' _ failing to keep pace with their
competitors and the rise of the market averages. If it goes on for
very long, underperformance is a sure road to losing accounts, and
maybe your job as well.
   In the 1982-87 bull market, many observers say, the performance
race helped keep the advance going far beyond any level that made
rational sense.
   In today's cautious environment, the pressure to perform, while
still present, is far less intense. In many a strategy meeting
these days, the talk focuses on limiting risk.
   By the logic that makes the market work, declines in stock
prices end and new bull markets are born when worries are rampant,
cash reserves are high and everybody has gotten out of stocks. In
that gloomy setting, there is nobody left to sell.
   Some Wall Streeters argue that the market is now at or nearing
such a point. But others aren't so sure.
   ``It's too late to be really bearish and too early to become
bullish,'' said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., an analyst at the firm of
Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
   ``There will occur, at some stage, a major turning point,'' said
Anthony Tabell at Delafield, Harvey, Tabell Inc. in Princeton, N.J.
``It will be accompanied by maximum pessimism and consequent large
holdings of cash.
   ``However, there is nothing to stop the current climate of
skepticism from continuing for a protracted period. It is difficult
to tell, therefore, when and where that turning point will be.''
   In the meantime, optimists in the financial world tide
themselves over with the thought, or at least the hope, that most
of the damage from the crash has been confined to Wall Street.
   Perhaps it was just an extreme manifestation of the market's
continuous up-and-down cycle _ the end of an era for Wall Street,
but not the end of the line for prosperity in the industrialized
world.
   ``It always repeats itself,'' said Schreyer. A market recovery
awaits, he contends, and ``I think it's going to be sooner rather
than later.
   ``I don't think this malaise is going to last for years.''
   Not everybody shares that optimism. ``The near-term outlook
isn't likely to improve substantially until full investor
confidence is restored in both the integrity of the marketplace and
the strength of the economy,'' Edward O'Brien, president of the
SIA, said in a generally bleak crash anniversary appraisal.
   ``In the regulatory arena, there have been a few steps taken to
curtail some of the practices and problems which occurred a year
ago. But major regulatory reform hasn't taken place.''

   The last time the United States had a recession,
bullets were flying in the Falkland Islands and Barney Clark was
preparing to get the world's first artificial heart.
   That was 1982, ancient history by economists' standards. In
November of that year, the economy began a powerful expansion that
is about to become the longest in U.S. peacetime history.
   Next month, barring calamity, the expansion will tie the
peacetime record set under George Washington from mid-1790 to
mid-1796. Economists do not foresee a recession until next year at
the earliest.
   The Mississippi River may have receded from its banks this
summer, but the 1980s economy just keeps rolling along, in spite of
bad weather, deficits and the worst stock market crash on record.
   On the afternoon of Oct. 19, 1987, with half a trillion dollars
in stock wealth suddenly evaporated, there were widespread fears
that the United States could be on the brink of another Great
Depression.
   Those fears are legitimized in a new study by Christina D. Romer
of the University of California at Berkeley, who concludes that the
uncertainty generated by the 1929 crash was indeed a major factor
in causing the Depression of the 1930s.
   ``Uncertainty is worse than knowing the truth, no matter how
bad,'' she quotes The Magazine of Wall Street as having said on
Nov. 30, 1929.
   What saved the economy from disaster a year ago were three main
things:
   _The Federal Reserve, which flubbed its job in the 1930s, had
the good sense this time to open the money spigots, allowing banks
to borrow freely and preventing the financial system from going
into gridlock.
   _Consumers kept spending, only slightly daunted by the crash.
One reason was obvious in retrospect. Most Americans don't own
stocks. Moreover, investors' losses in stock portfolios were offset
by gains in bonds, which rallied.
   _The economy withstood the crash because it was _ and is _
basically healthy. In October 1929, a recession had already begun.
   So, then, what caused Black Monday? The answer is simple: What
goes up must come down. Pumped up by greed and fantasy, the stock
market had gotten too high, especially in comparison to the larger
but less visible bond market, which competes for investors' dollars.
   Instead of adjusting to economic reality gradually, the way
theory says it should, the market plunged in a chaotic and
dangerous spiral that was exacerbated by computer-dictated selling
and breakdowns in the trading system.
   To be sure, those who say Oct. 19 was a warning thunderclap have
plenty of evidence on their side.
   The trade deficit is a persistent reminder that Americans still
aren't winning the battle of international commerce, even with a
devalued currency.
   In spite of a record expansion, regional recessions have
occurred in such places as Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia and
Michigan.
   Auto workers, steelworkers, farmers, miners, and oil drillers _
people who work with their hands _ have not fared well in the 1980s.
   The economy's high-tech transformation, although necessary to
meet foreign competition, is creating a mismatch between the jobs
that are available and the people who need work. At the bottom, a
small underclass seems mired in permanent poverty.
   Overall, living standards are rising, but more slowly than they
used to. That's because productivity improvements have slowed down,
for reasons that are not fully understood.
   U.S. productivity is growing at an anemic 0.2 percent annual
rate, compared with 0.7 percent in West Germany and 1.9 percent in
Japan, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
estimates.
   Most troubling, the United States has gone from the world's
largest creditor to its biggest debtor. ``Debt'' here is shorthand
for all sorts of foreign investments, including stocks, real estate
and companies.
   Optimists say foreign money will rebuild America the same way it
did in the 19th century, when London banks financed the railroads.
   Pessimists respond that America's foreign debt is the result of
foolish overspending that is going into consumption rather than
investment.
   All debt, including the kind Americans owe to each other, has
skyrocketed in the 1980s to more than 2.3 times the gross national
product, Bank Credit Analyst reported recently.
   Such a top-heavy debt ratio has not been seen since the
Depression.
   For all the legitimate complaints about the health of the
economy, though, it is undeniable that growth is better than
recession, which causes human misery while leaving productive
resources wastefully unused.
   In September 1982, the tail end of the last recession, the
jobless rate peaked at a 42-year high of 10.1 percent. Today
unemployment and inflation are bouncing between 5 percent and 6
percent.
   While Europe has stagnated and Japan's world-beating growth has
slowed down, the United States has created 15.5 million jobs since
President Reagan's inauguration.
   Economists can't agree why the United States has managed to
avoid recession for so long. One prominent idea, which might be
called the Kneejerk Theory, gives credit to the fast reflexes of
the bond market.
   The Kneejerk Theory says bond holders have learned to panic at
any sign of 1970s-style inflation. When the economy shows signs of
overheating, they dump bonds. That drives up interest rates, which
dampens the economy, preventing an inflationary spiral that would
lead to a crash.
   The Deficit Theory says the United States is able to avoid a
recession-inducing runup in interest rates because it is financing
its high level of spending with foreign borrowing _ trouble in the
long run.
   According to the New Age Theory, investments in labor-saving
equipment to cope with the coming labor shortage will allow the
United States to enjoy both low inflation and a low jobless rate.
Aging baby boomers will jack up the low U.S. savings rate.
   Finally there is the Luck Theory, which explains fortunate
events ranging from the drop in the dollar, which rejuvenated
exports, to the stock market crash itself, which knocked down
interest rates just as they were getting prohibitively high.
   When a recession finally does hit, it will be unusually severe
because of the likelihood of rippling defaults on the record
mountains of debt. Consider that farm banks and the savings and
loan industry are in trouble even without a nationwide recession.
   The federal budget deficit, already high, will skyrocket in a
recession as tax receipts fall and spending goes up.
   With the United States removed as an engine of world growth, any
downturn here is likely to spread to Latin America and could extend
to Western Europe and the Far East.
   There are plenty of causes for concern. But then, there always
are. In comparison to what people feared last October, things are
looking surprisingly good.

   Black Monday, the $500 billion crash heard
'round the world, left no craters on Main Street.
   In the first hours and days afterward, there were stories of
people pawning watches and buying gold. Real estate markets ground
to a halt, and some high-fashion clothiers in Manhattan
contemplated fire sales on suspenders.
   But one year later, such doomsday scenarios have given way to
more hopeful appraisals.
   While the crash instilled caution in the hearts and minds of
investors, cut the value of many stock portfolios and eliminated
thousands of jobs on Wall Street, other damage has been limited
across America.
   The figures say the nation's wealth shrank by the equivalent of
$2,000 for every U.S. citizen on Oct. 19. But the reality was less
severe in most places.
   ``It was kind of a non-event as far as we were concerned,'' said
Doug Fairweather, director of corporate media relations for Sears,
Roebuck & Co., the nation's largest retailer.
   Even in New York, the epicenter of the market crash, officials
say the impact on state finances was negligible.
   ``New York is experiencing a revenue shortfall during the
current fiscal year, but really that is a result of changes from
the federal income tax _ not related to the stock market,'' said
Ann Doyle, spokeswoman for the state budget division.
   Charitable giving did not decline, although the rate of increase
in 1987 was 6.65 percent compared to an increase of 9 percent the
year before, said David Tobin of the National Center for Charitable
Statistics.
   Home buying and retail sales slowed in many part of the country,
but other factors _ rising interest rates and indifference to
fashion trends, for instance _ were to blame for the sluggishness.
   The shock of the stock market crash was mostly absorbed because
the loss really didn't amount to $2,000 per person. After all, most
stock is in the hands of the upper crust, not average Americans.
   ``There was an initial shock, but the other shoe never dropped
for consumers or any of the others of us,'' said Sandra Shaber of
the Futures Group, an economic forecasting firm in Washington.
   That's not to deny that there was a real crash. Her firm
estimated that household net worth _ home equity and financial
instruments such as stocks and bonds _ fell at an annual rate of
22.2 percent in the last quarter of 1987.
   However, it bounced up 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 1988
and 2.3 percent in the second quarter.
   At the time of the crash, panicky investors fled to gold and
silver, traditional havens in perilous times.
   Dennis Lemke, president of University Avenue Coin and Stamp in
Madison, Wis., said business returned to normal quickly. ``Right
now, precious metals are more in the doldrums than last year.''
   At Investment Management and Research Inc. in Iowa City, Iowa,
Lois James reported last year that the brokerage kept busy as a
number of bargain-hunters jumped into the market.
   These investors, who typically pulled $1,000 to $2,000 out of
bank savings, require a little extra hand-holding, she said last
week.
   ``They haven't seen huge gains, but they haven't seen huge
losses either,'' she said. ``When the market goes down, they get a
little panicky.''
   In Iowa, she added, the crash was not as important to the
economy as depressed farm earnings and this summer's drought.
   In Colorado, where the crash arrived on the heels of falling oil
prices, Mayor Al Sweney of Longmont said he felt the crash's impact
in the annual budget process, which he described as the toughest in
his quarter century in city government.
   ``Without a doubt, I think the stock market affects the market
for new construction, and for investors who might have been here
earlier,'' Sweney said. His city, 30 miles north of Denver, expects
to attract 1,000 new jobs this year, but believes those jobs might
have been filled and working sooner if not for the market.
   The mayor, a retired city administrator, also took a personal
hit from the crash. ``It affected the pension fund that I'm drawing
from,'' he said.
   Jim Birne, director of Career Development and Placement at the
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, saw the crash's
impact in the declining numbers of MBAs going to New York.
   Thirty-five percent of Wharton's 1988 class took jobs in New
York, compared to 42 percent in 1987; 17 percent of the class found
work in investment banking, compared to 25 percent a year earlier,
he said.
   ``What the crash did that is good for the students is it taught
them that industries were risky,'' Birne said. ``That was good for
us; it taught people what was going on in their own careers.''

   Japan has taken another step in its effort to
become a leader in world economic policies by outlining a proposal
for easing Latin American debt problems.
   The proposal, detailed Tuesday at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, calls for some
Latin debt to be converted into bonds and payment terms on the rest
of the loans to be lengthened ``under appropriate conditions.''
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady received the plan cooly.
The plan is seen by some as a rival to the Reagan administration's

<HEAD>Brady Wants Third World Debt Solutions Acceptable To Private
Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Third World's $1.2 trillion debt should be
reduced, but only in ways that private markets find acceptable,
U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has told world financial
leaders.
   Brady also ruled out strategies that would turn over risky loans
from private banks to creditor banks' governments and their
taxpayers, and touted the use of debt-equity swaps and other
innovative devices for reducing debt.
   ``If we embark on a course that involves the transfer of risk
from the private to the public sector, a true and lasting solution
to the restoration of sustained growth among debtor nations will
have escaped,'' he said.
   Brady, making his first appearance on an international stage as
treasury secretary, spoke at Tuesday's opening formal session of
the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund. The meeting continues through Thursday.
   Most of the ministers of finance from the 151 member government
are attending the meeting, along with thousands of representatives
of banking and industry.
   Brady left for Washington right after his speech, giving no
public indication whether or not he was criticizing a Japanese
debt-relief proposal that would allow some Latin American debt to
be converted into bonds, with lengthened repayment terms.
   Brady defended the so-called Baker Plan, which calls for
providing new loans to developing countries that enact economic
liberalization policies. The plan was devised by his successor,
former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III.
   ``The United States regards with skepticism proposals that may
appear to conform to the basic principles of the debt strategy, but
which in practice will produce only an illusion of progress,''
Brady said. ``Indeed, such proposals will make the debt problem
intractable.''
   Without singling out any idea, Brady said such measures could
weaken international institutions and prompt political opposition
in creditor countries.
   The Japanese proposal outlined by Satoshi Sumita, governor of
the Bank of Japan, first was made at the Toronto summit of
industrialized nations.
   It calls for some Latin debt to be converted into bonds and
payment terms on the rest of the loans to be lengthened ``under
appropriate conditions.'' To back up the billions of dollars in
loans, the debtor countries could set up special reserve accounts
to be held in trust by the IMF, Sumita said in outlining the
proposal.
   Sumita said the countries also would have to agree to make
IMF-backed changes in their policies to foster economic growth.
   ``It does not entail any transfer of risk from the commercial
banks to the multi-lateral financial institutions or creditor
governments,'' Sumita said.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy praised the Japanese
initiative.
   ``Efforts by countries with large surpluses are a good way to
augment growth,'' he said.
   Beregovoy also opposed shifting to governments the risky loans
made by banks.
   Mexican Treasury Secretary Gustavo Petricioli, speaking on
behalf of Latin American nations, urged rich countries with extra
money to set up funds that ``constitute an additional source of
financing to the debtor countries in order to support their growth
or carry out debt-reduction operations.''
   Speaking on behalf of Latin American nations, Perticiolo called
for an International Development Pact to help the heavily indebted
developing countries.
   As part of the pact, he said that debtor countries should follow
economic policies that emphasize growth, that international
agencies and banks should channel more money to the debtors, and
that the industrial nations should spread out payment terms on the
debtors' loans.
   The atmosphere in Berlin has been marked by widespread
demonstrations of left-wing groups. They accuse the bank and fund
of impoverishing the Third World. On Sunday, tens of thousands
marched in a protest parade. Police did not let the demonstrators
come close to the International Congress Center, where the meetings
are being held.
   On Tuesday, a bank's windows were smashed and 100 demonstrators
were arrested.

<HEAD>Macmillan Agrees to $2.5 Billion Kohlberg Bid, Miffs Maxwell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British publisher Robert Maxwell, miffed that
Macmillan Inc. entered into a $2.5 billion buyout agreement without
telling him, is reviewing his options for continuing his pursuit of
the publishing giant.
   On Tuesday, Macmillan accepted a cash-and-securities buyout
offer valued at $90.05 a share from the investment firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co.
   The agreement also gave Kohlberg an option to buy four of
Macmillan's businesses under ``limited circumstances,'' which were
not spelled out in the announcement. Macmillan said details would
be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Macmillan had set a Monday afternoon deadline for submission of
``final'' buout offer. That evening, Maxwell said Tuesday, he told
Macmillan he was increasing his offer to $89 a share in cash. The
offer apparently fell short, as did Maxwell's outstanding tender
offer of $86.80 a share.
   Macmillan stock jumped $1.50 a share to close at $88.62{ Tuesday
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   A spokesman in New York for Maxwell Communication Corp. said it
was evaluating the Kohlberg offer but would not comment on whether
Maxwell planned to raise his $89 a share bid.
   Maxwell said he had asked the Macmillan board to inform him if
it received a higher bid so that he could have an opportunity to
quickly top it.
   ``I am shocked that (they) would enter into this hasty,
ill-conceived ... junk-bond financed offer with KKR without even
contacting me,'' he said in a statement.
   Macmillan rebutted that Maxwell was ``given every opportunity to
amend his bid.''
   Earlier this month, Macmillan agreed to a Kohlberg-led buyout
and then backed out when Maxwell bettered the price.
   But analysts speculated Kohlberg's latest bid would end the
auction. Even the most optimistic observers said the company was
worth little more than $90 a share.
   ``It's a bidding war, and it has become more than just an
economic question at these prices,'' said Robert Dunlap Jr., an
analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. The issue has become ``who
can eke out the highest bid.''
   Part of Maxwell's motivation in pursuing Macmillan lies in his
personal commitment to create one of the world's largest
communications concerns. He already owns major U.S. printing
operations and extensive media holdings in Britain.
   While Maxwell likely could afford to top Kohlberg's bid, ``he
said he was willing to pay a fair price, but not a stupid price''
for the company, said Bert Boksen, an analyst at Raymond, James &
Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
   Analysts said Kohlberg Kravis probably would break Macmillan
apart and put most of its emphasis on the company's information
services.
   The unit, which accounted for 40 percent _ or $62 million _ of
Macmillan's operating profit in 1987, has grown rapidly in recent
years. Dunlap expects the unit, which publishes directories
including Who's Who and trade magazines, can continue to grow at a
25 percent annual rate.
   If all 27.8 million Macmillan's shares were tendered,
shareholders would receive $82.05 in cash, $3 in notes and warrants
valued at $5 for each share they hold. The proportion of cash would
change if fewer than the company's 27.8 million shares were
tendered.
   Maxwell said he believed members of the financial community
``have valued the Kohlberg bid at less than $89 a share.''
   The Macmillan board approved Kohlberg's initial $85-a-share
proposal in mid-September, but withdrew its backing last week after
Maxwell raised his offer to $86.80 a share from $80.
   Macmillan has been embroiled in a takeover contest since May,
when a group led by wealthy Texan Robert N. Bass proposed a buyout
at $64 a share.
   The Bass group since has dropped out of the bidding, with its
last offer at $75 a share.
   In an attempt to head off a takeover attempt, Macmillan proposed
a financial restructuring it valued at about $64.15 a share, but
the Bass Group challenged the plan in court and won an order
blocking it.
   The restructuring would have split Macmillan into two companies
_ publishing and information services _ and paid a special cash
dividend to shareholders.
   In addition to its book publishing and information services
operations, Macmillan owns the Katherine Gibbs secretarial and
Berlitz language schools.

<HEAD>74 Percent of Women Bankers Say Their Companies Offer No Child
Care</HEAD>

   A national group of women bankers is mounting a
campaign to get financial institutions to provide child care for
employees' children, after a survey found almost 75 percent did not
offer any day care services.
   In the poll of 4,620 women financial executives with children
conducted by the National Association of Bank Women, 65 percent of
respondents said the absence of adequate day care has hurt their
careers.
   The survey indicated more than 60 percent of the respondents
spend up to three hours a week on the job dealing with children.
   ``The cost of all the lost time and unproductive time is a real
loss to the industry,'' said association President Emily-May
Richards, founder of the Richards Group, an Atlanta accounting
firm. ``What we want to do is fix this productivity problem, but it
has to be a cost-benefit situation.''
   The survey, released Tuesday at the association's convention in
Boston, indicated:
   _74.3 percent of respondents said their employer offered no form
of child-care assistance; 11.7 percent said firms offered some form
of flexible benefit programs. Just five respondents said the
employer provided on-site day care.
   _65 percent said they could have taken on additional job
responsibilities if they had adequate child care.
   _51 percent said they spend up to one hour a week at work
dealing with children and 10 percent spend one to three hours.
   _39 percent said they have children under age 10.
   _20.5 percent use licensed day care, 17.6 percent leave children
with a non-relative outside the home and 14 percent with a relative.
   Outgoing association President Evon Emerson said that because
the number of women financial executives is increasing, child care
is becoming a more important issue.
   She said women account for 70 percent of the banking and thrift
institution work force and 41 percent of its managers.
   The association estimated the average annual cost of caring for
one preschool child at $7,000.
   ``It's not going to be enough to win those people with just
salaries and job change,'' Emerson said. ``There needs to be
affordable, accessible, quality child care and we need to look at
all areas'' for financing it.
   Emerson said the association is forming a task force to study
and develop methods of public-private child care financing, as well
as lobby for child care legislation.
   The Chicago-based group, which was founded in 1921, consists of
27,000 managers, directors and officers from commercial banks,
savings and loans, credit unions and other financial organizations.

<HEAD>EDS Sues Former Leader, Says Perot Violating Departure Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM LOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The business Ross Perot has lined up for his new
company violates a no-competition agreement he made when he left
his old company, Electronic Data Systems, according to a suit filed
by EDS.
   The suit filed Tuesday in a Fairfax, Va. circuit court seeks an
order enforcing a Dec. 1, 1986, agreement in which Perot said he
would not compete with EDS for three years, said EDS spokesman Bill
Wright.
   The same agreement precludes Perot from operating a for-profit
company until December 1989.
   ``We are asking the court to ask Perot to honor this contract,''
Wright said.
   Perot founded EDS, a giant computer services firm, in 1962 and
sold it to General Motors Corp. in 1984. In December 1986, after a
highly publicized conflict between Perot and GM, Perot and three
other top EDS executives left the the company when GM agreed to pay
them about $850 million.
   The purpose of the no-competition agreement was to prevent Perot
from using ``proprietary and strategic information about EDS'
markets and services to compete with the company,'' Wright said.
   Perot ``with his public statements and marketing activities is
showing that he has no intentions of honoring that agreement,'' the
suit claims.
   The alleged violations include Perot's proposal earlier this
year to automate the U.S. Postal Service. After protests by EDS and
other companies, the General Services Administration suspended
Perot's postal contract.
   Although he had not seen the suit, Perot said, ``It really looks
silly.''
   ``All they do is spend a lot of money on legal work,'' he said.
   In June, Perot founded Perot Systems Corp. and the company
obtained a controversial no-bid contract to automate the Postal
Service. Perot has challenged the GSA's suspension of the contract.
   The Postal Service contract is just one of Perot's activities
that EDS claims violate the 1986 agreement.
   Wright declined to give other examples of how Perot and his new
company may have broken the agreement, but said, ``We don't think
it will be hard to prove.''
   ``Suffice to say, it's (violations) across a broad range of
markets EDS serves,'' Wright said.
   In July, Perot bid on a Medicaid contract, which expires in
1989. EDS won the lucrative Medicaid contract in 1976, helping the
company establish its reputation nationwide.

<TEXT>
   A group of Washington lobbyists have formed
the capital-based National Vintners Association to promote and
represent in Congress the wine interests in the 43 producing states.
   The NVA, in addition to representing the approximately 1,300
wineries in this country, also is targeting for membership
thousands more winegrape growers at the start of the production
chain, according to association Executive Director Richard Feeney.
   The NVA ``is a national trade association based on Capitol
Hill...because the wine industry faces serious threats from federal
regulation, because NVA members need to have timely, accurate
information from Washington,'' Feeney said.
   Feeney, a Congressional lobbyist and onetime director of the
National Meat Association, said his direct connection with wine was
from 1970-74, when he was partner in a wine importing business.
   Feeney said the association, only a few weeks old, had no
intention of vying for supremacy with California's 54-year-old Wine
Institute, which directly represents for 520 of the state's 770
wineries.
   Most other wine-producing states have no organization, said
Feeney, contending, ``The fact remains that if a vintner in
Virginia or Oregon wants to join a national organization, there
ain't any.''
   Feeney said he did not think many other wine-producing states
had adequate liaison with Congress and federal agencies affecting
the industry.
   Vintners are worried about what they see as a wave of
prohibitionist feeling in America, expressed in new label laws,
restaurant posting of toxicity warnings for pregnant women, new
taxes, and a widespread anti-alcohol surge.
   One of the NVA's most ambitious programs will be to lobby
Congress to change the way federal law regards winegrapes, said
Feeney, who said lawmakers might be ready ``to look at wine
differently.''
   Unlike many other agricultural products, grapes grown for wine
get no subsidy, and the end product is regarded an alcoholic
beverage subject to regulation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.
   Feeney said, ``the time has come for wine to take its place with
other agricultural products'' and to share benefits enjoyed by
``commodities such as soybeans, beef, dairy products, catfish and
pork.''
   He said he wants wine looked upon as food, a desire that
coincides with ongoing efforts of California's major vintners,
principally Robert Mondavi, who is about to launch a privately
financed pro-wine program.

<HEAD>U.S. Uranium Industry Ailing, But Recovery Possible, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States' uranium industry is
critically ailing, but the possibility for some recovery exists,
according to one uranium company official.
   ``I'm convinced that the U.S. industry is nonviable,'' James W.
Sanguinetti, director of uranium marketing for Freeport Uranium
Co., said Tuesday in addressing a national industry seminar during
a three-day meeting. ``The fact that annual production has declined
over 70 percent since 1980 and that exploration dollars have
declined over 90 percent is indicative of an ailing, if not dying,
industry.''
   Howard L. Walton of the Energy Department's Energy Information
Administration said production of uranium, the fuel source for
nuclear energy, totaled about 13 million pounds last year, with
about 8.5 million coming from conventional mining methods. Similar
output is expected this year, compared with peak production of 43.7
million pounds in 1980, he said.
   Canada, the world's largest producer, totaled 32.4 million
pounds in 1987.
   Walton also noted that in 1987:
   _Industry employment was at its lowest level since the
government began keeping statistics.
   _Surface drilling footage for uranium development and
exploration was 1.96 million feet, down 5 percent from 1986 and
only 4 percent of the peak recorded for 1978.
   _Aggregate industry assets were down by more than 55 percent
between 1982 and 1987, from $3.6 billion to $1.6 billion, as firms
got out of the uranium business or wrote down assets.
   Walton said Arizona, Texas and Wyoming accounted for 77 percent
of the total surface drilling in 1987 _ 22 percent, 25 percent and
30 percent respectively.
   Sanguinetti said about 90 percent of the uranium consumed in the
United States was bought under long-term contracts, with prices
roughly ranging from $30 to $35 a pound. The remainder is bought on
the spot market, with current prices of about $14 a pound, he said.
   But Sanguinetti said inventories are diminishing too. ``We are
getting close to balance, but we haven't reached it yet,'' he said.
   Sanguinetti said he thinks the market price has bottomed and
will show some improvement as the impending demand is felt.
   Utility managers are under tremendous pressure to reduce
operating and maintenance costs and to take advantage of fuel
prices in the depressed spot market, he said. But continuation of
such policies will expose the utilities to volatile pricing that
will be inevitable as supplies and inventories decline, he said.
   Sanguinetti also said that as the number of operational nuclear
plants increases, along with their efficiency, demand for uranium
will increase.
   He predicted a potential for producing about 20 million pounds a
year if prices reach about $20 a pound and about 32 million pounds,
or 80 percent of America's demand, at $30 a pound.
   ``The higher the price, the more viable producers there are,''
Sanguinetti said. ``In the United States, because of the abundance
of reserves, viability is a function of price. At some point, the
whole industry will be declared viable again because of its ability
to supply a significant quantity of uranium.''

<HEAD>Money Back Guarantee, 30-Day Trade Promotions Tested By Chrysler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN L. ADLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buyers of new Chrysler Corp. cars and trucks in
Washington, D.C. can get a full refund within 30 days of purchase,
and Denver buyers can trade in a car they don't like under
experimental marketing programs.
   Both promotions run until Nov. 20 and will be pumped by Chrysler
Chairman Lee Iacocca in television spots and newspaper
advertisements, the company announced Tuesday.
   They are extensions of the company's heavily-hyped ``Car Buyer's
Bill of Rights'' touted in two-page newspaper ads by Iacocca
earlier this month.
   Dealers in the two cities say they don't know what to expect,
but an industry analyst says she thinks similar promotions will
follow from other U.S. car makers as traditional cash rebates and
percentage rate deals continue to fade.
   ``The initial impact is not as influential as a rebate,'' said
Cynthia Certo, an analyst at Integrated Automotive Resources in
Wayne, Pa. ``It is a very good image-building tactic.
   ``What the automakers are saying is they have improved quality
and they're going to back it up. They're saying, `Here's the
guarantee.' The Europeans have been doing things like this for the
last year and a half.''
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said the company hasn't
decided whether to extend the promotion as it did in 1982, when the
company was recovering from its near-failure.
   ``We went back and looked at what we had done before and decided
this program had some merits,'' he said. ``At this point, it's
strictly a test program.''
   Fewer than 1 percent of cars sold during the nationwide
promotion six years ago were returned, Jakobowski said.
   In Denver, Chrysler is allowing customers to bring back a
Chrysler product for exchange anytime within 30 days after purchase
for exchange on another Chrysler product. The buyer can trade up or
down and pay or be refunded the difference according to the
original contract, excluding any incentives, financing and
insurance costs incurred on the first car.
   ``The area advertising on this starts (today),'' said Alex
Jannicelli, retail sales manager at Colorado Chrysler Plymouth in
Denver. ``It's a brand new thing. We don't know how it will go
over. Talk to me in a week.''
   Reaction in the Washington metropolitan area also has been slow.
   ``I guess not that many people know about it,'' said Rick Warn,
sales manager of Rosenthal Dodge in northern Virginia. His
dealership is one of 47 participating in the money back promotion.
   General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac division sponsored a promotion
offering exchanges within 30 days or 3,000 miles to California
buyers of the Grand Am in the summer months. Fewer than 0.5 percent
returned them for different Pontiacs, spokeswoman Sheila Main said.
   ``Certainly, we're evaluating the program for possible
expansion,'' she said.
   Ford Motor Co. spokesman Dave Krupp said the No. 2 automaker has
no plans for similar offerings.
   ``This is an incentive program. We have incentives in place that
we're happy with, that are proven. We plan to stay with them.''

<HEAD>Time, Warner Reportedly Discussed Merger Last Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
executives reportedly came close to a $10 billion merger last month
but the deal fell through, according to an unnamed source quoted in
Wednesday's editions of the New York Times.
   The newspaper said the source, who it described as an industry
expert familiar with the talks, said a major reason the merger
talks broke down was the difficulty of reaching agreement on how to
manage the combined operations of the two media companies.
   The deal, aimed at making their companies so big that they would
be almost invulnerable to a takeover, reportedly was discussed in
detail by J. Richard Munro, chairman of Time; Steven J. Ross,
chairman of Warner; N.J. Nicholas Jr., Time's president; and Gerald
M. Levin, Time vice chairman, according to the industry expert.
   The proposed merger never was put to the boards of directors of
each company because Time's board might have rejected it, the
industry expert said.
   Spokespeople for Time and Warner each declined to comment to the
Times on the report.
   Time's stock soared by more than $19 a share last week on the
New York Stock Exchange amid unconfirmed rumors that the media and
entertainment giant was contemplating a buyout or restructuring,
but then fell $10.25 on lack of any development.
   After the stock jumped $9.62{ a share to $116.25 on Sept. 19,
Time issued a statement saying it knew of no reason for the rise in
its stock price.
   ``While it is Time Inc.'s policy not to comment on market
rumors, in view of the uninformed speculation about the company in
the last two trading days, Time Inc. said today that it is not
considering a leveraged buyout or any other transaction that could
account for the rise in its stock price.''
   Time closed Wednesday at $106.25 a share, down 12{ cents. Based
on its roughly 58 million common shares outstanding, the company
has a stock market value of about $6.16 billion.
   Warner closed at $35.50 a share, up 37{ cents in New York Stock
Exchange trading, giving it a market value of about $4.47 nillion
based on its 126 million outstanding shares.
   The industry expert quoted by the Times indicated the merger
talks began two months ago, to consideration a combination of just
the companies' cable television operations, but later expanded.
   Time is a leading magazine and book publisher, owns the Home Box
Office pay-television service and has an 82 percent stake in
American Television and Communications Corp., a cable television
operator with about 3.78 million subscribers.
   Warner owns Warner Cable, the naton's sixth-largest system, with
about 1.4 million subscribers, as well as the Warner Bros. film
studio.
   The combined Time-Warner operations would employ 30,000 people
and have annual sales of more than $8 billion, making it one of the
biggest entertainment industry companies.

<HEAD>Sources Say U.S. Price-Support Proposal Would Help Latin America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sources at International Coffee Organization talks
said a U.S. proposal Tuesday on regulating supplies and prices
would tend to benefit Latin American producers at the expense of
most African countries.
   They said the effect of the U.S. proposals for the coming year
would be to transfer export market share from producers of the
cheaper robusta grade to those selling the sought-after arabica
type.
   The sources at the London talks spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The bulk of robusta production _ about 25 percent of all world
coffee grown _ from Africa, principally the Ivory Coast, Uganda,
Cameroon, Zaire and Madagascar. The biggest producer outside the
region is Indonesia.
   Arabicas are grown throughout Latin America, with Brazil and
Colombia the biggest producers. Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania and India
are the only significant non-Latin American producers.
   Under the U.S. proposal on the shape of the ICO's market control
plan for the year beginning Oct. 1, producers would be exempt from
reductions in export quota if the price of their type of coffee
exceeded $1.25 a pound.
   The average price of arabicas is just over $1.30 on world
markets, and robustas averaged slightly more than 90 cents.
   The U.S. plan calls for an initial 1988-89 global export quota
of 58 million bags, which would be cut by 1.5 million bags if the
ICO indicator of the average price of robustas and arabicas was
$1.15 or below any time during the year. One bag equals 60 kilos,
or 132 pounds.
   A further cut of 1.5 million bags would take place not less than
10 days after the first if the indicator remained below $1.15 a
pound.
   The indicator _ currently just above $1.13 _ is likely to be
below $1.15 on Oct. 1, thereby triggering an immediate reduction in
the 1988-89 global quota, industry sources said.
   ``Current prices levels are telling us that the brunt of that
cut would be borne by robustas if the United States has its way,''
said a trader.
   The price of this grade was certain to be below $1.25 and that
of arabicas just as certain to be above, he said.
   Robusta producers would also risk losing out under the U.S.
proposal if any quota increases took place in 1988-89, the sources
said.
   Earlier Tuesday, officials of Brazil and Colombia _ the world's
two biggest coffee producers _ said they were ready to open
negotiations with consumers on a price-support regime following
agreement on a joint position.
   The Brazilian-Colombian proposal calls for an initial global
export quota of 54 million bags for 1988-89. The aim would be to
defend an unchanged price range in the area of $1.20 to $1.40 a
pound.
   The 1987-88 ICO export quota stands at 51.5 million bags.
   According to a copy of the Brazilian-Colombian proposal, the
1988-89 global quota would be increased at fixed trigger prices to
reach 58 million bags _ balance between supply and demand _ at
$1.30 a pound.
   It would let producers of arabica coffee have a greater share of
any quota increase than those growing the cheaper robusta grade.
   All proposals presented Tuesday will be considered by a special
contact group of key ICO countries set up to try to negotiate a
price-support deal for 1988-89 by the scheduled end of the talks on
Sept. 30.
   The United States, the European Economic Community and other ICO
consumers want to increase supplies of mild arabicas in 1988-89,
because of growing demand for this grade and the record premium its
price has established over robustas.

<HEAD>African Leader Says Third World Needs More Say In Debt Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The finance minister for Botswana said Wednesday
that the Third World should have more say in designing
debt-reduction programs.
   P.S. Mmusi, a spokesman for African nations, also questioned
whether the United States and other industrialized countries
actually used the case-by-case approach to Third World debt.
   ``Although a case-by-case approach is allegedly used in the
design of programs, it is common knowledge that much of the work is
done in Washington and that different country programs show a very
close similarity,'' Mmusi said at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
   Both institutions devote much of their efforts to helping debtor
countries out of financial trouble. The World Bank also finances
projects to help them raise their living standards.
   Mmusi said debtor governments should become more active in
designing the programs which are the condition for aid from the
World Bank and IMF.
   Third World leaders often complain that debt-reduction programs
are too austere, requiring, for example, the elimination of food
subsidies. Rather than a case-by-case approach, many debtor
governments would like to see a general reduction of their debts
and the interest they pay on them.

   The stock market was little changed today, still
deadlocked over the outlook for interest rates and the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.24 to
2,083.57 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 361 up, 456 down and
532 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 15.71 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were looking ahead warily to economic
reports for September, which will begin to be issued next week.
   The Labor Department's report on the employment situation for
this month, in particular, is widely expected to show strong job
growth and thus put a damper on recent hopes that the economy was
cooling off.
   Whatever the economic data say, however, market-watchers
generally believe stocks will have trouble attracting much
enthusiastic buying for some time to come.
   The approaching anniversary of Black Monday on Oct. 19 is
reviving unhappy memories of the crash.
   Furthermore, brokers say, there is a great deal of uncertainty
among investors about the prospective outcome of the presidential
election campaign.
   Among today's early volume leaders, International Business
Machines rose \ to 113{; Union Carbide gained | to 23~, and
Weyerhaueser was down [ at 23~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.02 to 151.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .50 at 297.90.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.84 to
2,082.33.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 600 issues up, 779 down and 543 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 113.01 million shares, down from 116.42
million on Monday and the lightest total since 108.72 million were
traded on Aug. 30.

<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beckman Corp. says a major
restructuring of its pharmaceutical business could save the company
$100 million a year by the end of 1990.
   SmithKline, which makes animal health care products and
pharmaceuticals such as Contac cold medicine, announced Tuesday it
was laying off about 1,600 workers as part of the reorganization to
reverse declining sales.
   Under the restructuring, the company's U.S. and international
drug sales and research will be consolidated and headed by John F.
Chappell, who has been head of the international business since
1985, SmithKline said.
   ``To create jobs in the future, we need to be a lean, low-cost
company today,'' Henry Wendt, SmithKline's chief executive officer
said.
   Wendt said the restructing could result in annual savings for
the company of around $100 million in the next two years.
   He said about half of the job losses stem from the closing of
the company's 40-year-old pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in
Philadelphia. SmithKline employs more than 40,000 workers in the
United States and overseas.
   SmithKline recently announced a 25 percent drop in
second-quarter profits. The realignment will result in a
third-quarter charge of between $375 million and $400 million
against pretax earnings.
   Nevertheless, the company said it expects 1988 earnings to be
$3.75 to $4 a share, up from a 5 percent to 10 percent anticipated
drop in 1987's $4.50-a-share profit, the company said.
   On the New York Stock Exchange SmithKline stock closed at
$46.12{ Tuesday, down $2 a share.
   If the changes are successful in handling pharmaceutical
business more efficiently than in the past, the moves will be
successful, said Richard Stover, an analyst with Alex Brown & Sons
brokers in New York. ``They have been slow in making decisions and
slow in commercializing products.''
   The company said in July it would reorganize its business
following a lackluster first-half performance. The company also
predicted that earnings for the full 1988 fiscal year would be down
by 25 percent in addition to the second-quarter decline.
   ``Our purpose remains unchanged,'' Wendt said. ``We are a
technology-driven company pursuing worldwide leadership positions
in fast-growing segments of the health care and life sciences
markets.
   ``We are positioning Smith Kline & French Laboratories, our
pharmaceutical business, to receive more focused leadership and
attention under a single organization designed to more rapidly
commercialize current products and develop and market future
products on a worldwide scale,'' he said.
   SmithKline earlier had blamed some of its problems on the
disappointing sales of its two top drugs _ Tagamet, an anti-ulcer
drug, and Dyazide, a drug used in the treatment of hypertension.
   But Wendt said at a news conference that Tagamet's recent
disappointing performance was not the cause of the shakeup.
   ``If there were strong Tagamet sales and less competition, we
would still be here today talking about these decisions,'' he said.
   With the cost of developing and introducing a new drug at about
$125 million, the company needs to market new products worldwide
and consolidate research and marketing, he said.
   The company also said it plans to issue 5 million new shares of
Beckman Instruments, a subsidiary of SmithKline Beckman.

<HEAD>After the Crash of '87, Americans Chose Good Sense, Not Panic</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Few Americans will ever forget the crash of Oct.
19, 1987, a day in which a half-trillion dollars in paper wealth
disappeared, when newspapers wore black headlines, when
newscasters' voices betrayed fear.
   People felt in the midst of history, of being victims of events
not understood. It conjured gray images of bankruptcies,
breadlines, unemployed, mortgages foreclosed, impending depression.
It was 1929 again.
   Those were the first impressions, but they may not be the ones
that endure. Because the worst did not happen, the lasting memory
may be a delightful sense of relief.
   Within a few weeks, fear had lost its cutting edge, although
anxiety still gnawed at confidence. That feeling too began to fade
before the end of the year, evolving into a mere wariness that
economists termed healthy.
   In the newer atmosphere, consumers were less inclined to take on
debt, investors seemed motivated by sensible yields rather than
instant wealth, and business resolved to remain lean and
competitive.
   Moreover, there ensued a renewed effort by global powers to
synchronize economic policies, which heretofore had often been at
odds. Promises were made to stabilize the dollar, to coordinate
interest rates and open up trade.
   All in all, Americans surprised themselves. Despite frightening
comparisons with 1929, forecasts of a further debacle in
securities, and expectations of recession by esteemed academics and
others, panic never gripped the country.
   Part of the reason for that was good fortune; part can be
attributed to good crisis management.
   On the side of good fortune was the health of the economy, which
was growing strongly at the time of the crash with a resilience
born of five years of expansion. On the management front, quick
action by the Federal Reserve to open credit lines in the wake of
the crash was key to restoring calm and liquidity.
   And because most Americans were not direct owners of stocks in
the first place, they were able to avoid the brunt of the crash's
punishment.
   The memories that remain, therefore, are those of a near miss, a
lesson learned, a feeling of gratitude, a determination to fix up
the things that were wrong, such as the budget and trade deficits.
   It was, some said, a shot across the bow, a warning that helped
the world avert a disaster. Before the end of the year, the great
stock market collapse was even being hailed as a savior. It averted
a worse disaster, some said.
   In fact, as the year ended, Fortune Magazine editors asked:
``Who would have predicted it on Oct. 20th? The crash has not only
failed to make a recession more likely before mid-1988; it has made
one less likely.''
   When the crash occurred, a feeling existed that the economy was
overheating and headed for inflation and higher interest rates, to
be followed by a deep recession. The crash slowed things.
Incredibly, it took the pressure off.
   Very little evidence of the great crash has showed up in the
economic statistics since then. Confidence has remained high.
Business continues to spend for capital improvements. Economic
indicators show expansion continuing.
   But there were effects, important ones with potentially
far-reaching consequences:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>_In the stock market itself.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The collapse routed the madness that had pushed prices beyond
reason. A year ago, stock prices got so high in relation to
earnings per share that an investor would have been foolish not to
buy bonds instead. The crash, in effect, put stocks on sale by
slashing prices.
   A year after the collapse, stock prices were about 12 times one
year's earnings, a decline of 40 percent.
   The market was healthier _ no question. Trading activity had
quieted. Impossible expectations had diminished. The touts and
hucksters were being scorned. People no longer believed prices
could soar to the heavens.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>_In regulation and self-discipline.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Regulatory officials, both in government and the industry, seem
more aware of the dangers inherent in the mechanics of the
marketplace _ that is, in the ability of markets, brokers and
technology to handle heavy volume.
   Various study committees have pointed to dangers in the
activities of program traders, arbitragers, insiders and other
active, short-term participants with sufficient financial clout to
accelerate price changes.
   Critics continue to say, however, that there has been more study
than action, more talk about new rules than changes in the rules.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>_In international cooperation.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The securities collapse was global. Not only are marketplaces
interlinked electronically, but economies are interdependent. As a
consequence, monetary, fiscal and trade policies of trading nations
impact each other infinitely.
   While international cooperation since the crash has been
volatile at times, with arguments raging about trade restrictions,
interest rate levels, credit conditions, fiscal policies and the
like, there has been some improvement.
   The dollar has stabilized, for the time being at least. American
goods seem more competitive abroad, helping to correct the U.S.
payments imbalance and creating a healthier trade relationship
among nations.
   Central banks throughout the world are now intensely aware that
they must coordinate economic policies, since it is known that the
slightest problems left untended can cause financial aberrations
detrimental to all.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>_In expectations.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps the biggest impact is still beyond easy statistical
measurement. It is a renewed sense of realism about expectations, a
vigilance about economic management, a recognition that a stable
economy requires restraints.
   Without a doubt, most Americans are less cocky about continued
economic expansion, but it is difficult to prove. While almost
certainly they are more risk-conscious, almost every survey shows
them optimistic.
   While hardly a day goes by without people being reminded that
another shoe could fall somewhere in the economy _ that there is a
crash impact yet to be felt _ the chief worries today relate to the
basic economic cycle.
   Now completing its sixth year, the economic expansion would seem
to be in old age. For that reason alone, forecasters find it
convenient to consider recession a possibility _ but they are
forever postponing it.
   The stock market itself gives little indication, but it is still
watched for clues. True, a feeling exists that the big crash of
1987 seems to have been confined primarily within the securities
industry itself.
   But economy watchers realize that no sector of domestic activity
is isolated from the rest, any more than American, European or
Asian economies are immune from each other's specific problems.
   Stock markets still are viewed as long-term economic indicators.
And, in spite of the mysteries it hides, none remains more
scrutinized for clues than the American marketplace.

<HEAD>Black Monday: The Way It Unfolded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was sunny and mild in downtown Manhattan the
morning of Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, but black storm clouds had
gathered inside the balconied trading room of the New York Stock
Exchange.
   At 9:30 a.m., the opening bell clanged and the storm broke.
   In the next 6{ hours, a half-trillion dollars of stock wealth
disappeared and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks lost
a record-shattering 508 points.
   Stock prices had fallen fitfully since late August, when the Dow
Jones average peaked at 2,722.42.
   The Friday before Black Monday, the average posted its first
triple-digit decline _ 108 points _ culminating the biggest weekly
decline since World War II.
   Over the weekend, investors asked themselves whether the
five-year bull market had ended. Interest rates were climbing, the
trade deficit seemed intractable and U.S. officials were wrestling
with West Germans over economic policy.
   Before trading opened, stocks fell sharply in Tokyo and London
and a huge reservoir of sell orders piled up awaiting execution in
New York. The dollar plunged and gold soared to its highest level
in almost five years.
   Adding to the pessimism, a bulletin said the United States had
destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf.
   Prices on the NYSE plunged from the opening bell. The Dow Jones
average fell about 69 points by 10 a.m. and an unprecedented 201
points by 11 a.m.
   Then there was a bounce, a breath of hope for the market. By
noon the average was down just 128. But then the selling resumed,
with just two modest rallies around 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.
   The most blindly relentless sellers were portfolio insurers,
whose strategy called for them to sell clients' stocks or
stock-index futures whenever the market went down.
   The volume of more than 600 million shares overwhelmed the
computerized trading system and damaged a crucial link between the
NYSE and the futures markets in Chicago.
   Small investors were last in line to sell. Some brokers took
their phones off the hook.
   Rumors spread shortly after 1 p.m. that the NYSE would be
closed, and a rapid denial by the Securities and Exchange
Commission failed to convince nervous traders.
   The bond market had fallen most of the day, but began a powerful
rally in late afternoon. Traders decided the crash signaled a
recession or worse, which would be good for bond prices.
   Shortly before 3 p.m. the Dow Jones average had lost roughly 250
points. From then on, stocks went into a sickening free fall that
was terminated only by the closing bell at 4 p.m.
   At 5:45 p.m., Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stepped
off a plane in Dallas and asked someone how the market closed.
``Down five-oh-eight,'' the official said.
   For a moment Greenspan was relieved, thinking the person meant
5.08 points instead of 508. For Greenspan, as for the rest of the
world, Black Monday took a moment to sink in.

<HEAD>New Shock Waves from Crash Could Erase More Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Battle-scarred Wall Street professionals, their
ranks thinned by last October's crash, could be in for another jolt
and more job losses.
   The shock waves sent out a year ago by the stock panic are still
being felt, as many skittish investors have stayed away from the
market. That has brought a prolonged decline in profits for the
nation's battered brokerage firms, intensifying pressure on them to
let more employees go or leave more vacant jobs unfilled.
   Some 12,000 to 17,000 people in the securities industry _ 7.5
percent to 10 percent of the work force _ lost their jobs as a
result of the Oct. 19 crash, according to some estimates. Few have
found new jobs within the industry, and some experts predict that
the number of unemployed could double before the situation
stabilizes.
   ``We're going to see more layoffs coming,'' said Perrin Long, an
analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
   Another 4,000 to 5,000 Wall Streeters could lose their jobs by
the end of the year, he estimates. They would swell the legions of
crash victims: stockbrokers, financial analysts, floor traders,
secretaries, and back-office clerks and computer operators who
process orders for stocks and bonds.
   Much of the impetus for new job cuts could come from the big
brokerage companies' earnings reports for the third quarter, which
are widely expected to be even worse than in the previous
three-month period.
   ``They won't be good,'' said Donald McLellan, an analyst for
Fitch Investors Service Inc., referring to the third-quarter
reports. ``The longer this goes on, the more layoffs there will
be.''
   In the second quarter, results already were mixed. The overall
profit of New York Stock Exchange member firms doing business with
the public increased more than 25 percent from a year earlier, but
160 of the 386 companies lost money, the exchange said in a recent
report.
   Between September 1987 and August of this year, 9,186 former
employees of brokerage firms applied for New York State
unemployment benefits, up sharply from 3,500 applicants in the same
period a year earlier, according to the state's Department of Labor
in Albany.
   The maximum unemployment benefit in the state is $180 a week,
one of the lowest in the country, payable for up to six months.
   Those who lost jobs came from three broad categories of Wall
Street workers: clerical and secretarial, paying less than $40,000
a year; brokers and mid-level management, paying $40,000 to
$100,000; and top-level executives pulling in over $100,000.
   ``What we're seeing is an ongoing restructuring on Wall
Street,'' said Samuel Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner in New York
of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. ``I don't think we've seen
the end of the process.''
   Mari Terzaghi, a clinical psychologist who specializes in
patients from the financial community, says she still treats many
people suffering from what she calls the ``identity crash''
triggered by Black Monday. When people develop a sense of
themselves in money symbols, then lose them because of investments
or jobs, they feel a sense of annihilation, she explains.
   ``The situation really has not gotten better,'' Ms. Terzaghi
said, noting that Wall Street types continue to come to her because
they're ``unable to re-establish a sense of control, a sense of
their self-identity.''
   At least one patient developed heart problems largely because of
post-crash stress, she said.
   Some of the big brokerage houses are trying to put a good face
on things _and if they're planning more layoffs, they're not saying.
   Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., which cut around 4,000 people, or 8.5
percent of its work force, in the wake of the crash, has recently
started to expand in some areas, spokesman Fred Yager said.
   The expansion has been accomplished mainly through internal
transfers rather than by hiring new employees, he explained.
   ``We have a very upbeat attitude right now,'' Yager said. ``It's
become less of a crapshoot and more old-fashioned business sense.''
   Merrill Lynch is marking the anniversary of the stock debacle
with a series of investment seminars around the country on Oct. 17.
   The first big victim of the crash was E.F. Hutton Group Inc.,
which was absorbed in a merger last December by another Wall Street
giant, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Some 5,000 to 6,000 Hutton
employees were squeezed out by the combination.
   Since then, ``there's been a certain amount of caution or
conservatism in terms of adding people,'' Shearson spokesman
Michael O'Neill said.
   Like the other brokerages, Shearson's retail business has
suffered, but O'Neill noted growth in other areas like merchant
banking, mergers and acquisitions and European operations.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. laid off 150 to 200 of its 11,000
employees. Kidder Peabody & Co.'s firing of around 1,000, or 13
percent of its staff, was partly due to a corporate reorganization
that preceded the crash, the firm says.
   Some brokerage houses are touchy about the layoff issue and
refuse to discuss specifics.
   ``We're not doing head counts,'' said Peter Costiglio, a
spokesman for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Some displaced Wall Streeters seem to be finding new jobs in the
industry, but not enough to make a real dent.
   Raymond James & Associates, a medium-sized brokerage firm in St.
Petersburg, Fla., was swamped with job applications from
shell-shocked Wall Street denizens after Black Monday.
   Now, though, ``the trickle-down theory is over with,'' said
Lawrence Silver, vice president of marketing services for the firm.
   Others are turning to different industries, finding jobs in
manufacturing companies, service industries and insurance companies
(usually as salesman in the latter). Attorneys, accountants and
financial analysts seem most able to transfer their skills to new
jobs, while brokers are having the hardest time of it.
   ``They're having trouble,'' said Gregory Ferrara, a managing
partner of Forum Personnel Inc.'s lower Manhattan office.

   The stock market eked out a small gain today,
still deadlocked over the outlook for interest rates and the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.09 to 2,086.42 by

   Besides throwing thousands of Wall Street professionals out of
work, last October's market crash seems to have reduced the ranks
of aspiring stockbrokers, too.
   In August, 4,894 people took the qualifying written exam for
brokers given by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
down from 6,774 in August 1987. The number of candidates normally
increases from year to year, the NASD says.
   The six-hour exam is tough: The failure rate is around 40
percent to 50 percent. There are no educational requirements, just
a $50 fee.
   It's given on the third Saturday of every month at 36 locations
around the country, and less frequently in five foreign cities.
   Successful candidates get their fingerprints taken and sent to
the FBI.
   There were about 470,000 NASD-registered brokers as of June 30
of this year, up from 450,000 on June 30, 1987. Not all of the
qualified brokers are actually practicing their craft, however.

   Computer consultant Ernest Harden still shakes
his head in disbelief when he thinks about how an eleventh hour
telephone call saved his $300,000 investment portfolio.
   ``Hank (his financial planner) had tried to reach me two weeks
before the stock market crash to get me to sell, but I kept putting
him off,'' the Jacksonville, Fla., man recalled. ``When I called
him back I took his advice.''
   That was just a week before the Oct. 19 collapse.
   While Harden, who had most of his portfolio in stocks, was
luckier than most investors, his evolving investment strategy has
taken a near-universal conservative turn. Less-risky money market
accounts and fixed-income products, such as bonds or certificates
of deposits, are in these days, while stocks considered too
speculative are out.
   ``There has been a change in appetite,'' said Marshall B. Front,
an economist at Chicago-based Stein Roe & Farnham, which manages
about $11 billion in investment assets, including pension funds and
individual accounts. ``There's much greater emphasis on capital
preservation and less emphasis on capital enhancement.
   ``It mirrors what's been going on in the stock market in general
today. The volume is down; the level of interest seems to be quite
modest.''
   After the crash, many investors, who had thought the
once-roaring stock market invincible, rushed to put their money
into what they considered safe havens: government-backed Treasury
bonds and notes, CDs, less risky mutual funds or just plain savings
accounts.
   The amount of stock the average American family held in its
investment portfolio declined to 20.1 percent in the fourth quarter
of 1987, from 25 percent the previous quarter, the peak of the bull
market, according to Goldman Sachs & Co.
   Net deposits in the nation's federally insured savings
institutions soared by $12 billion the last three months of last
year, government regulators found. During those same months, assets
of money market mutual funds gained about $15 billion nationwide,
compared to a loss of about $60 billion in equity fund assets,
according to the Washington-based Investment Company Institute,
which tracks mutual funds.
   All that money flowing out of stocks helped keep interest rates
down at a time when some economists were forecasting a recession.
The lower rates made a lot of bondholders happy because the price
of their debt securities rose as a result.
   ``Bonds were a very big beneficiary of the stock market crash,''
noted Jay Goldinger, who runs the Beverly Hills, Calif., investment
banking firm Capital Insight Inc. ``The vast majority of my money
and my client's money was in bonds. I didn't lose because of it.''
   Those who did lose money are now diversifying more, financial
planners said, while others are shopping for investments of another
kind.
   ``When given the decision between investing and consuming they
(clients) say they would rather consume,'' said Michael Stein, a
financial planner with Brownson Rehmus & Foxworth in Chicago.
``We're seeing people upgrading their residences, buying second
homes or vacation homes.
   ``They're also spending money to furnish those new residences.''
   Harden, 45, who runs his own computer consulting business, fits
into that category. He said after the crash he and his wife, Linda,
bought several single-family homes in the Jacksonville, Fla., area
as an investment.
   ``The most protection an investor can have is in real estate,''
Harden said. ``I don't trust the (stock) market.''
   His financial planner, Hank Madden of New York-based IDS
Financial Services Inc., said that the way some people
indiscriminately poured money in the market before the crash
contributed to its downfall by making some stocks rise too high,
too fast.
   ``A lot of it goes back to the hamburger mentality of America:
gimme the sizzle, fast,'' Madden said. ``In times of prosperity ...
people invested more on emotion than in logical planning.''
   Since the crash, many investors have decided to pay more
attention to their investments. Financial advisers say that
investors are pickier, opting for stock of companies with solid
earnings or those that can weather certain economic changes like
rising inflation.
   Lenn Width, 69, a retired lumberyard owner who belongs to two
investment clubs in the Seattle area, said he remains optimistic
about the market even though the value of each club's portfolio
lost about 25 percent after the crash, around the average drop for
most investment clubs.
   ``What it (the crash) really developed into was a much better
buying opportunity ...,'' Width said, adding that his clubs already
have recovered at least half of their losses.
   ``You pick up a newspaper and you see things advertised for 25
percent and you run over and get it. It's the same way with the
stock market.''

   The stock market crash not only produced big losses but also
took some of the fun out of investing for those who do it for a
hobby.
   Interest in starting private investment clubs _ do-it-yourself
mutual funds that pool members' money mainly to buy stocks _ has
declined, according to the National Association of Investors Corp.
of Royal Oak, Mich., which helps organize the groups.
   NAIC Executive Director Thomas E. O'Hara said that since the
crash he has received about 10 percent fewer inquiries from
would-be club members. When the market was at its peak, in the
summer of 1987, his office was flooded with requests for startup
material, he said.
   More fledgling clubs also went under after the crash.
   ``We ordinarily lose about 50 percent of the clubs in their
first year. After the crash we were losing about 70 percent,''
O'Hara said.
   The collapse in stock prices drained the value of clubs'
portfolios on average 22 percent, although many clubs have recouped
at least half of those losses, he said.

<HEAD>Corporate Finance Emerges Unscathed From '87 Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Crash of '87 may be part of Wall Street
lore, but it's already a fast-fading memory for the moneymen who
have kept corporate transactions moving.
   Mergers and acquisitions, junk-bond deals and new stock
offerings snapped back with a vengeance in the first quarter of
1988, as if making up for lost time, and have marched at a heady
pace ever since.
   Initial nervousness vanished rapidly as investors began to look
upon decimated stock prices as wonderful bargains.
   ``We essentially had a doubling up; it was the logical deal flow
from the previous quarter,'' said Les Fabuss, a senior vice
president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   From January through late September, more than $128 billion was
spent to gain majority stakes in 2,089 companies, according to IDD
Information Services. That compares with 1,981 such deals, for
$91.7 billion in the year-ago period.
   What has changed is that investment houses and brokerages have
become increasingly dependent upon fees garnered from these deals.
   ``It's become very hard to make money out of sales and trading
operations,'' Fabuss said, as the volume of stocks changing hands
in daily trading has eroded substantially.
   Despite the crash, billion-dollar mergers have been no strangers
to the marketplace, with Campeau Corp.'s $6.6 billion takeover of
Federated Department Stores Inc. topping a lengthy list for the
year.
   In the junk-bond sector, the sale of $1.07 billion of the
high-yield, high-risk bonds by Duracell Holdings Corp. _ in what
was one of the largest speculative issues of 1988 _ went off in
September without a hitch.
   In addition, experts say the junk-bond market has attracted a
greater number of players over the past year, making the market
less dependent upon the singular force of pioneer Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., which has been charged with fraud by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   Even the crumbling of Revco D.S. Inc.'s leveraged buyout in
July, the first major junk-bond buyout to sink into bankruptcy
court, failed to send shivers through the debt markets. Instead,
experts pointed to the deal's poor execution _ sales and earnings
projections were far too rosy and buyers failed to line up to
purchase assets.
   Immediately after the crash, junk bonds, which are often used to
finance corporate takeovers or restructuring plans, plunged on
average between $30 and $80 per $1,000 face value. But by February,
new junk-bond issues again were being churned out to the tune of
more than $1 billion a month.
   In the equity markets, the number of initial public offerings
has been cut in half this year compared with 1987, but the dollar
value remains quite high. From January through August, IDD figures
show companies raised $17.1 billion in the stock market, compared
with $19.4 billion in the year-ago period.
   Size remains a handicap for some corporate dealmakers, however.
Though they typically are not represented statistically, the number
of young firms seeking to raise $20 million to $30 million in the
equity markets has dropped more than 50 percent since October 1987,
estimated Mark Radtke, a vice president at Venture Economics Inc.,
a consulting firm in Wellseley, Mass.
   In the crush to meet expenses, entrepreneurs are knocking on the
doors of venture capitalists and seeking corporate partners rather
than relying on the public.
   ``This sector has been hit pretty hard,'' Radtke said, noting
that only ``the top tier of companies'' are successfully going
public.
   Indeed, if the big guns have anything left to worry about, it's
that they might miss another good fishing expedition, if the market
tanks again.
   Articulating a common Wall Street sentiment, Fabuss noted that
``everybody's very much aware that were there to be another crash,
it would create tremendous opportunity.''
   Robert Willard, senior vice president and head of mergers and
acquisitions at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., agreed, noting
that a ``certain callousness has been built up that (another crash)
would be an opportunity, rather than something to run from.''

   Oil prices could continue eroding through the
year's end as world economics encourage quota cheating by members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, some
economists say.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, waffled in a
16-cent trading range early today. Shortly after 11 a.m. EDT, the
contract was down 8 cents to $14.06 a 42-gallon barrel. The
contract closed Tuesday at $14.14 a barrel after falling to $13.85
early in the day.
   On Sept. 12, prices briefly touched $13.75, the lowest since
October 1986.
   Other contract months also closed lower on Tuesday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery advanced 0.34
cent to close at 45.59 cents a gallon, while other contract months
ended the day mixed. October wholesale heating oil closed down 0.72
cent at 39.51 cents a gallon while other contract months also
declined.
   Tuesday's price drop came amid strong disappointment with the
outcome of the OPEC price committee's two-day meeting, which
adjourned Monday without any concrete plan for dealing with the
world oil glut and weakening prices.
   Prices dropped early in the session amid continued negative
sentiment about the price committee meeting, analysts said. Prices
continued deteriorating as reports circulated that U.S. crude
inventories were higher.
   The market recovered most of its losses by the end of the day, a
turnaround that market analysts attributed primarily to technical
factors.
   Some analysts said they expected slightly lower prices in the
near term followed by a recovery if the OPEC committee meetings in
October and November lead to a reduction in oil output.
   But economists said Tuesday's sharp drop in prices was part of a
predictable pattern of gradually eroding prices they expected to
continue through the end of the year and possibly beyond.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that economists are correct
and we're headed lower,'' said James Steel, an analyst at Refco
Inc. ``Market analysts are too immediate in their thinking.''
   Economists base their predictions partly on the fundamental
difference between production costs and selling price.
   Steve H. Hanke, chief economist of Friedberg Commodity
Management Inc. in Baltimore and professor of economics at Johns
Hopkins University, said the marginal cost of production ranges
between 30 cents a barrel for Iraq and $4.65 for Nigeria.
   ``The cost is much below current prices. Therefore everyone has
an incentive to cheat and produce more,'' Hanke said. ``This is
aggravated by a situation where the biggest producer, the Saudis,
are running a huge fiscal deficit and other OPEC producers have
severe needs also.''
   Hanke said he did not expect the OPEC meetings to produce
anything substantive for the long term. Any increase in prices will
be only temporary, he predicted, with prices possibly plunging to
$10 a barrel over the next several months.
   Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist at Ashland Oil Inc., said
that while the OPEC meetings were a step in the right direction,
they were unlikely to produce any concrete solutions in the near
term.
   ``OPEC's problems are long term and they need to identify them
as well as their objectives,'' Tahmassebi said. ``Maybe after four
or five meetings they might come up with something credible that
might work in the long run.

<HEAD>Warner-Lorimar Merger Blocked By State Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge has blocked Warner Communication
Inc.'s $1.18 billion acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures Corp.,
ruling that the merger violates terms of a 1984 agreement between
Warner and its largest shareholder.
   Warner said today that it planned to appeal the decision.
   The ruling handed down Tuesday by New York Supreme Court Judge
Walter Schackman was a victory for Chris-Craft Industries Inc., a
broadcasting and manufacturing company that controls 23 percent of
Warner's voting stock.
   Chris-Craft claimed in a suit filed in July that since Lorimar
owned six television stations the acquisition violated a four-year
agreement prohibiting Warner from owning any TV station so long as
Warner owned 25 percent or more of Chris-Craft's BHC Inc.
broadcasting subsidiary.
   Warner acquired a 42.5 percent stake in BHC in exchange for
Chris-Craft getting the 23 percent interest in Warner's voting
stock.
   In his 13-page decision, Schackman said that ``as a matter of
law the pending acquisition of Lorimar by Warner will be a breach
of the shareholders agreement.''
   Schackman said Warner could not acquire any Lorimar stock until
the televison stations were sold or it reduced its stake in BHC.
   Since the Chris-Craft suit three Lorimar television stations
have been sold and Warner reportedly is negotiating the sale of one
of the remaining three.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
marginally higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction
to increased export demand for U.S. corn.
   But early gains were limited by selling linked to the advancing
corn and soybean harvest, analysts said.
   ``Traders are hesitant to bid up the market in the face of that
seasonal pressure,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain market analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   In export news, the Agriculture Department announced that the
Soviet Union had purchased an additional 550,000 metric tons of
corn for delivery during the coming year, and Mexico was said to be
seeking 100,000 metric tons of U.S. corn or sorghum.
   The Soviet purchase was expected, Spilka said.
   ``We're just seeing confirmation of old rumors, so the market
doesn't do much with it,'' he said.
   Wheat futures rose but analysts said speculators were losing
hope for new life-of-contract high prices in that market.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.22{ a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to } cent higher with December at $2.86{ a bushel; oats
were } cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.47{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 6 cents higher with November at $8.12 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .08 cent higher with October
at 71 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with September at 80 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to
.37 cent lower with October at 39.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .45 cent to .60 cent lower with February at 49.50
cents a pound.
   Pork bellies fell the 2-cents-a-pound limit for daily trading on
Tuesday. Hog futures also closed lower while cattle prices were
mixed.

   The Tennessean, Nashville, Tenn., on gun control:
   Look again at that gun control vote in Congress recently.
   At issue was the Brady amendment to the sweeping drug
legislation, which would have required a seven-day waiting period
before the purchase of a handgun.
   The amendment's defeat was a shame _ but it wasn't a surprise,
and it wasn't cheap.
   Common Cause reported ... that from 1983 until last July, the
National Rifle Association has pumped $1,167,908 in political
action committee contributions into the coffers of those members of
Congress who voted against the amendment.
   The vote on the measure was 228-182. Of the 194 House members
who voted on the measure and had received no NRA money, 142 of them
_ 73 percent _ voted against the NRA's position.
   The amendment had the support of every major law enforcement
organization in the country. These groups lost a battle.
   Money talks, and in Congress and state legislatures, money
votes. The NRA money bought the NRA victory, and the people stand
helpless, wondering which PAC represents them.

   The Capital Times, Madison, Wis., on high school football player
injuries:
   Deerfield (Wis.) High School officials faced a tough decision
this fall. Their football team _ only three seasons ago a contender
for the state championship _ had fallen on hard times.
   Between decreasing enrollment and early season injuries to upper
classmen, the Deerfield Demons were fielding a team composed mostly
of freshmen and sophomores. That meant more than the potential of
losing games. It meant the potential of serious injuries to young
players.
   ``We've got 14- and 15-year-olds going up against 17- and
18-year-olds,'' coach Pete Christopherson said. ``What's more
important than a young person's health?''
   That is precisely the right question and why Deerfield school
officials were right to shorten their football season, even though
it means forfeiting three games. They are putting the youngsters'
welfare first, and for that, they deserve a lot of credit.

<TEXT>
   It grows so relentlessly that it leaves you
little time to dwell on the impact it has on your way of life, but
that impact affects you from youth to retirement.
   It is the credit society.
   Not long ago it was felt a student should graduate from college
and enter the adult world bright-eyed and raring to go. Now the
student begins with a load of tuition loans to be repaid.
   Less than 20 years ago you felt sorry for the poor bloke who had
to borrow money on the house. A mortgage was there to be paid off,
and nothing provided more satisfaction than doing so. Borrow on the
house? What a pity!
   A house today is considered a cash cow, the equity to be tapped
for what people consider essential expenditures. That's the
assumption, but you wonder when you see your neighbor borrow for a
trip to the Caribbean.
   You may recall that back in the 1960s it was customary to pay
off the car loan in two or three years. Now you take up to seven
years, which means the car might have to be junked before the loan
is retired.
   Perhaps you were one of those people who swore not to run up any
more credit card or bank card debt, since only 40 percent of the
interest _ not 100 percent, as before _ is deductible from your
income tax. Have you kept your promise?
   Or, as is likely, have you been enticed into using your credit
card by the promotional onslaught from the issuers? It's hard not
to bite, because the ``free'' offers come in the mail and over the
phone _ often at dinnertime.
   Once you applied to the bank for credit, but now the bank
applies to you. Why not? The rates they charge you on installment
loans are better than rates they can get almost anywhere else, even
if the paperwork is onerous.
   Back in 1960, consumer credit amounted to about $65 billion. By
the end of 1987 it wad reached $753 billion.
   That figure has been inflated, of course, by the declining value
of the dollar. But most of it is real growth. In 1978, consumer
installment debt as a portion of disposable personal income was
under 15.5 percent and fell close to 14 percent in 1982 and 1983.
Lately it has been in excess of 18 percent.
   Americans have a tradition of managing their credit
intelligently, but some observers wonder if borrowers will be able
to handle the new flexible rates, those that tend to rise at the
wrong time _ that is, when the economy in general is going the
other way.
   The Credit Union National Association recently called attention
to one of the newer problems in handling loans, especially for
automobiles.
   ``Imagine your surprise, even shock, when you learn your car is
virtually worthless as a trade becuase you owe more on it than the
dealer is willing to give you in trade.
   ``The reason? You probably chose longer-term financing for your
automobile _ five, six, even seven years.''
   Even more shocking are the costs involved in longer-term
financing.
   For example, an $8,000 loan at 14 percent interest for six years
would require a monthly payment of about $165. But interest over
the life of the loan would total almost $3,870, only 40 percent of
which is deductible.
   Credit is great, as you read everyday in newspaper
advertisements, hear on radio and television, and are informed by
lenders who load up your mailbox with offers.
   But it is also an expensive habit, perhaps even an addiction.
Some people are never able to shake it in a lifetime.

   The government wants to sell
shares in the state-run airline and telephone company as other
countries with large budget deficits have privatized ports, banks,
oil companies, car manufacturers, shipping lines and hotels.
   But with the economy in disarray, the ties that bind business to
government are not giving way easily.
   Powerful unions criticize the proposed sale of Aerolineas
Argentinas and ENTel, the phone company, because employees might
lose jobs or wages.
   The opposition Peronist Party, closely aligned with the unions,
complains about being left out of discussions in both deals, and
has erected obstacles to the sales in the Congress.
   ``I don't think either deal will be approved,'' said Peronist
Sen. Carlos Tenev, chairman of the Committee of Analysis and
Surveys that reviews the proposed sale of state companies.
   The opposition portrays the sale of state property in terms of
forfeiting the national patrimony, but the party in power believes
privatization is essential to putting the ailing economy back on
track.
   President Raul Alfonsin proposed the airline and phone company
sales with an eye to reducing the bulging budget deficit and
attracting foreign capital and technology. Plans also are being
drawn up to sell shares in the state shipping line ELMA, and divide
the train company into cargo and long-distance passenger segments,
and offer them for sale.
   The Alfonsin government also has committed itself to sell its
interests in seven petrochemical plants, and is considering an
offer by a U.S. consortium to invest $800 million over five years
to build and operate a natural gas processing plant.
   ``A few years ago, it was impossible to even talk about these
things,'' said Horacio Losoviz, director of state companies. ``I
think the perception has developed that it is absolutely necessary
to change direction, due to the economic crisis.''
   Argentina has major investments in several hundred companies,
and influences many others through import restrictions, export
tariffs, foreign exchange regulations, wage and price controls, tax
and investment laws.
   The exploration and production of oil, natural gas and coal is
controlled by the state, as is the distribution of water,
electricity and telephone lines. The railroad is state-owned as are
the main air and shipping lines, and most every port.
   The armed forces at their own factories make, in addition to
tanks and planes, explosives for construction companies, precision
gear for automobiles, farm equipment, train cars, industrial
solvents, tubes, pipes and specialty steel products.
   An estimated 2 million people work for the state of a total
labor pool of about 12 million.
   ``If Lenin were to come here, he'd feel right at home,'' said
Juan Jose Cresto, an economics professor at the University of
Buenos Aires. ``Everything is in the hands of the state.''
   It remains to be seen how much Alfonsin can accomplish before
national elections next May in which the ruling Radical Civic Union
faces an uphill struggle against the Peronists. Other parts of
Alfonsin's economic program have drawn fire for devaluing the
national currency, implementing voluntary wage and price controls
and lifting some restrictions on imports.
   The goal of the initiatives is to stem inflation, running at an
annual rate of more than 400 percent, and secure new loans to cover
the country's $56 billion foreign debt.
   But even critics of privatization concede that many things the
state operates, it does ineptly and at high cost.
   Argentines wait years to get their own telephones. Many people
register their mail _ and pay higher postage _ in the hope it will
arrive at its destination, unopened, within a reasonable time.
   Ferrocarriles Argentinos, the train company, runs decades-old
trains operated by unions that strike for reasons as minuscule as
the lack of gloves for workmen to link the wagons.
   Aerolineas Argentinas has more than 100 more employees per plane
_ 307 to 205 _ than does Scandinavian Airlines Systems, which has
offered to buy 40 percent of the national carrier for $204 million.
   Public Works Minister Rodolfo Terragno estimates that the 13
biggest state companies, which ran a deficit of $2.9 billion last
year, waste $2 billion a year by paying inflated prices for goods
and services.
   ``For 40 years, Argentina has had an economic system
characterized by the advance of the state over private
activities,'' said Alvaro Alsogaray, a former economy minister and
the presidential candidate of the center-right Union of the
Democratic Center. ``That is the cause of backwardism here.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, as promised, today vetoed
legislation tightening curbs on textile, apparel and shoe imports.
He said the bill would have ``disastrous effects'' on the U.S.
economy.
   Reagan's action set the stage for a congressional override vote
next week. One prime backer estimated he was within eight votes of
the two-thirds majority needed to overrule the president.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan vetoed the
bill as soon as it arrived from Capitol Hill.
   ``We vetoed it as soon as we got it,'' Fitzwater said.
   The bill, intended to protect American industries against
foreign competition, won final congressional approval last Friday,
but without a two-thirds margin.
   Reagan, in a statement released by the White House, charged that
the measure ``would have disastrous effects on the U.S. economy.
   ``It would impose needles costs on American consumers, threaten
jobs in our export industries, jeopardize our overseas farm sales,
and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for
U.S. exports. president said.
   ``This bill represents protectionism at its worst. At a time
when American exports are booming, the United States must not
embark on a course that would diminish our trade opportunities.''
   Asked about possible repercussions of the veto on Vice President
George Bush's election effort in the South, where even some staunch
Republicans had backed the bill, Fitzwater replied, ``It's our
belief that, politics aside, ... protectionism is the issue here.''
   But a chief Senate sponsor of the bill, Ernest F. Hollings,
D-S.C., issued a statement saying, ``We gave President Reagan
exactly what he asked for.''
   ``Seven years ago, the European Community globalized its quotas
and President Reagan recommended we globalize our quotas. We did
what the president wanted. This is political demagoguery at its
worst.''
   The bill would:
   _Freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels this year and
limit growth to 1 percent annually starting in January.
   _Freeze imports of non-rubber footwear with no provision for
increases.
   _Impose import quotas on 180 categories of textile products and
30 types of footwear, a system that would be reviewed after 10
years.
   _Set up a one-year program under which the government would
auctioned off import licenses and set a special quota for silk
neckties.
   Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said he hoped to vote on the veto
Tuesday. ``We figure we're about seven or eight votes off right now
and we hope to wangle those by then,'' he added.
   ``I expected the veto,'' Derrick said. ``Reagan is misguided
when it comes to his idea of protectionism. He thinks there's such
a thing as free trade and there is no such thing as free trade in
the world.''
   Fitzwater said he was confident the veto would not be overridden.
   The House approved the bill on a vote of 248-150 on Friday.
Earlier this month, the Senate approved the measure 59-36.

<TEXT>
   The textile and apparel industries, along with a number of
unions and their congressional allies, had called the bill vital to
halting job losses of more than 400,000 in those industries,
hammered by a surge of foreign-made goods early in the decade.
Worse, they say, those imports are still flooding American markets.
   Those claims are dismissed by critics, who point to burgeoning
earnings in the textile industry this year brought on by automation
and greater efficiency in the plants.
   The critics, including retailers and businesses fearing new
curbs would trigger retaliation against their exports, say the
increase in efficiency and automation were the result of the
increased competition. Protectionism, the critics argue, would dull
the American competitive response.
   Also today, Reagan signed legislation implementing the
U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement, saying it will mean lower
prices for consumers and many new jobs for workers.
   The action clears the way for the United States to phase out
tariffs on $131 billion in merchandise that crosses the U.S.-Canada
border each year. Leaders of the Canadian Senate, however, have
said the chamber will delay action on the agreement until Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney calls an election, which could come in
November.

<HEAD>Bush's Savings Plan Weak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's savings plan for low- and
middle-income people is likely to leave many of them scratching
their heads and wondering if there was something left unsaid.
   As described by Bush, it would seek to induce individuals into
long-term savings plans with a reward many of them would consider
niggardly. In some instances, it might amount to no reward at all.
   Under the proposal, up to $1,000 a year would accumulate
tax-free if funds remained on deposit for at least five years. When
spent, however, interest income would be taxed at the regular tax
rate.
   This, Bush explained to voters, would be ``helping themselves
become better able to afford a home, pay for college or start a
business,'' as well as increasing investment and economic growth.
   A quick analysis of the numbers, however, suggests that few are
likely to benefit a great deal unless they leave the money on
deposit for a lifetime, which rules out its use in education,
homeownership or entrepreneurship.
   If, for example, a person deposited $1,000 a year for five years
at 10 percent interest, a very generous and probably unobtainable
rate, it would seem their account would grow to about $6,700. But
it really wouldn't.
   Buying power is the only honest way to measure a dollar, and
inflation during those five years is likely to average something
like 4 percent a year. The net interest, therefore, would be 6
percent rather than 10 percent.
   That would make the five-year savings account worth just over
$6,000, meaning a pretax gain of about $1,000. However, since the
Internal Revenue Service doesn't recognize inflation, it will tax
the apparent $1,700 return.
   The tax bite, therefore, will be either 15 percent or 28 percent
of $1,700, or roughly $475, reducing the account's value to a net
of just over $5,500. For denying oneself the immediate use of
money, the return is about $100 a year.
   More importantly, a limit of $1,000 a year at almost any
realistic interest rates isn't going to help a whole lot in buying
a house, financing an education or creating seed money for a
business enterprise.
   The vice president's team concedes that the benefits of his
so-called Individual Savings Account plan are small; that
concession might be especially pertinent in the housing area.
   Studies have shown repeatedly that the biggest impediment to
home ownership among young couples and individuals is the down
payment. Once over that hurdle, many of them have the income to
meet their monthly payments.
   With this in mind, housing and real estate people have advocated
various plans under which savings placed and left untouched in
special housing accounts should receive the same benefits as
Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Some, in fact, advocate that the existing IRA mechanism, rather
than any new bureaucratic device, be used. Money already in IRA
accounts therefore could be used for future retirement or present
housing needs.
   Some go further. While money removed from IRA accounts by
retirees is taxed at their prevailing tax rate, money removed and
invested in houses would not be taxed. Trust housing lobbyists to
think of that one.
   Opposition to such ideas deals mainly with the cost. Critics say
that a nation already scourged by deficit spending cannot afford to
lose more revenue. A general argument also exists _ that housing
already has too many subsidies.
   The counter argument is that Americans deserve good housing and
make better citizens when they own property. Moreover, supporters
contend, what better way to hedge against inflation and prepare for
retirement than to own a house?
   If the vice president is seeking to encourage savings and thus
keep the economy strong, the housing supporters say, why not REALLY
encourage home ownership.
   They contend that no better forced savings plan has ever been
devised than the house with a mortgage on it.

   Prices closed modestly higher on the London Stock

   The gain failed to match Tuesday's jump, which followed news

<TEXT>
   Finance leaders of industrial nations on Wednesday
questioned a Japanese plan for easing the Third World debt problem,
while poor countries renewed their appeals for more help.
   Nigel Lawson, the British chancellor of the exchequer, told
reporters at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank he found the Japanese proposal ``a little bit
elusive.''
   Japan's central bank governor, Satoshi Sumita, announced the
plan Tuesday as a way to help the big debtor countries, like Brazil
and Mexico, which have a total debt of more than $220 billion.
   Under the plan, some of the countries' foreign debts would be
converted into bonds. Interest on the bonds would be backed up by
escrow accounts the debtors would set up with the IMF, and the
bonds could then be sold to banks and other financial institutions.
   Sumita did not provide many details about the idea, and some
finance chiefs said they needed more information.
   Lawson said the plan would not be acceptable if it called for
making public agencies, rather than the banks, bear the risk of
non-payment by debtor countries.
   ``The question arises as to how the countries concerned are to
acquire the collateral which they would place with the fund under
the scheme,'' he said. German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
told reporters ``in essence every initiative should be welcomed.''
   But Stoltenberg said he wanted to know more and questioned
whether the IMF should hold escrow accounts for the debtors.
   ``We want to study that very carefully,'' he said. ``We want to
see if there are other ways. We have to assess whether the IMF
shouldor has to play that role.''
   The IMF has been key in drawing up financial rescue packages for
developing countres that cannot meet their debt payments. Its
sister organization, the World Bank, provides the countries with
aid for economic development.
   Many of the finance officials from the 151 member nations of the
organizations are attending the annual meeting, which ends Thursday.
   The major industrial nations gave final approval over the
weekend to a plan that would aid the poorest debtors, mostly in
sub-Saharan Africa. But the bigger debtors also would like special
treatment.
   The industrial nations have been following the Baker Plan for
the debt problem. That plan, devised by former U.S. Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, calls in part for providing new loans
to developing countries that enact economic liberalization policies.
   But Colombian Finance Minister Luis Fernando Alarcon Mantilla
told the meeting, ``The strategy envisaged a few years ago to
resolve the debt problem has turned out to have serious
limitations.''
   He complained about the economic programs the countries have put
into place to win more financial help.
   ``Reiteration of the (economic) adjustment efforts,'' he said,
``is increasingly straining the people's capacity to bear their
consequences, and the programs are floundering in an intolerable
vicious circle.''
   Botswana's finance minister, P.S. Mmusi, said, ``More and more
countries (are reaching) the point where further austerity, in the
absence of meaningful economic growth, has become politically,
socially and economically untenable.''
   The debtor countries want more money from the banks to get their
economies moving, but the bankers have been reluctant to do that.
   Lawson also threw cold water on a Japanese proposal to reduce
the weight of the dollar as an international reserve currency and
boost the importance of a composite currency created by the IMF.
   The dollar and the German mark are the world's two leading
reserve currencies held by governments in their coffers.
   Sumita said, ``It would be more realistic at this point to
consider ways of diversifying reserve currencies to complement the
dollar's key role.''
   He said Japan has been removing barriers to the use of the
Japanese currency, the yen, as an international currency.
   The IMF currency is known as the special drawing right, or SDR,
and its value is based on a basket of currencies, including the
dollar. A single SDR is currently worth $1.29.
   The monetary unit is only a bookkeeping measure.
   But French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said Tuesday, ``The
time has come to make (the SDR) a more widely used reserve
currency.''
   Lawson said there has been a persistent effort to substitute the
dollar for the IMF currency.
   ``It hasn't come to anything,'' said Lawson, ``and I don't
believe it is likely to do so.''

<HEAD>FERC Sends Merger Plan Back to Staff</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today
sent the proposed merger between Pacificorp and Utah Power & Light
Co. back to its staff for further information.
   The FERC staff presented the commission with a draft that would
have permitted the merger but required the combined company to
auction its excess transmission capacity. The utility would then
have to construct additional transmission capacity when it was
needed.
   The merger between the companies based in Portland, Ore., and
Salt Lake City would create an $8 billion utility serving 1.2
million customers in seven western states.
   Under the proposal, owners of Utah Power's common shares would
receive Pacificorp stock worth between $32.25 and $38 a share,
depending on its average closing price over the 10 days after the
merger was approved. The utility has 59.6 million shares of common
stock outstanding.
   Commissioners asked the FERC staff to justify imposing any
conditions on the merger and to submit a more detailed
recommendation next week. They then will vote on it individually,
without another formal meeting.
   The two utilities say their merger would save them $500 million
the first five years and that Utah Power's rates would drop between
5 percent and 10 percent. The proposal would make Utah Power a
division of Pacificorp., along with the latter's electricity
business, Pacific Power & Light Co.
   The merger has been approved by shareholders of both companies
and regulators in all the states that would be affected.
   A federal administrative law judge recommended FERC deny the
combination, however, saying the merger would be anti-competitive
and that the utilities had failed to show it was in the best
interest of the public. FERC staff lawyers later recommended the
merger be approved subject to certain conditions.
   Pacificorp Chairman Don C. Frisbee has said his utility would
not pursue the merger if FERC rejected it.
   The proposed merger was approved by regulatory commissions in
Oregon, Utah, Washington, California, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana.
   Because Utah Power's electricity needs peak in the summer
air-conditioning months and Pacific Power's are highest during the
winter heating season, the merger would give the combined utility
as long as a decade before it would have to build new electricity
plants, officials of the two companies have said.
   The increased consumption during the winter also would boost
Utah's coal mine production, Utah Power spokesman Dave Mead said.
   Earlier this month, Utah financier Ian Cummings, chairman of the
New York-based holding company Leucadia National Corp., made a $1.2
billion cash bid for a majority interest in the privately held
utility, or about $600 million less that Pacificorp's.
   Utah Power officials refused to comment, but Wall Street
analysts were baffled why Leucadia would be interested in the
regulated utility, saying they did not anticipate any significant
earnings growth over the next few years as a stand-alone company.
   An Oregon utility watchdog organization has sued the state
Public Utility Commission in an effort to block the merger. The
Citizens Utility Board claims in the lawsuit Oregon ratepayers
would subsidize Utah Power's ratepayers because the latter would
receive a rate reduction.
   Spokesmen for the state agency and Pacificorp said safeguards
are built into the proposal that would prevent Oregon ratepayers
from subsidizing those in Utah.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after a late sell-off in
the wheat market crushed a broad rally.
   Prices for future delivery of wheat plunged about 8 cents a
bushel during the session's last 20 minutes, in reaction to a
report that Taiwan had agreed to buy a total of 340,000 metric tons
of wheat from Canada over the next three years, analysts said.
   The news disappointed wheat traders who had been looking for an
increase in foreign demand for U.S. wheat, said Walter Spilka,
grain market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New
York.
   ``The wheat market just broke down late in the session and that
was enough to pull the corn market back down,'' Spilka said. ``The

   Most of the buying that had fueled the rally earlier in the day

   Knight-Ridder Inc. and Tribune Co. announced
plans Wednesday to expand their joint supplemental news service
with a photo wire, a merged graphics service and a new wire for
smaller newspapers.
   Beginning Oct. 1, the KNT News Wire will be known as
Knight-Ridder-Tribune News Information Services.
   The Washington, D.C.-based service will become the first
supplemental news service to offer both electronic graphics and
daily black and white and color photos to subscribing newspapers,
the companies said.
   Through the merger of graphics services, Tribune graphics that
used to be mailed will be offered via the Knight-Ridder electronic
network.
   The new wire service for small and medium-size newspapers is
known as Select and will include a variety of news, sports,
entertainment and other material, the companies said.
   Coverage of business, entertainment and lifestyles also will be
expanded on the main wire.
   The service goes to more than 200 newspapers besides the 30
owned by Knight-Ridder and nine owned by Tribune Co., said Walter
Mahoney, vice president for sales.

<HEAD>Issue of Seizing Funds Left Unresolved in Princeton-Newport Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has left unresolved whether the
government can freeze money of innocent members in an investment
firm that is involved in a racketeering case, an issue in the
federal campaign against securities fraud.
   U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter, hearing the case against
five members of a small investment firm who were indicted on
racketeering charges last month, asked attorneys on Tuesday to
present legal briefs on the issue before he makes a ruling.
   The case against the defendants, partners in Princeton-Newport
Partners, a small investment firm based in Princeton, N.J., has
attracted widespread interest because they are the first securities
professionals ever to be indicted under the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations law.
   Convictions under that law carry enormous financial penalties
and in this case could possibly put Princeton-Newport out of
business, although it and other unindicted partners have not been
accused of any crime.
   Lawyers following the case have said its implications also are
significant because of a similar indictment that could emerge
against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the giant Wall Street
investment firm accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission
of widespread securities fraud.
   Drexel has denied those accusations. But if it or any Drexel
employees was indicted under the racketeering law, a freeze on
Drexel assets could seriously compromise and possibly cripple the
firm's ability to do business.
   Last week, a federal appeals court said the government could
place controls on Princeton-Newport's assets to preserve property
that might have to be forfeited should the defendants be found
guilty of the racketeering charges. But the appellate court also
returned the case to a lower court for more consideration.
   Federal prosecutors argued before Carter on Tuesday that the
government should be able to reach beyond the indicted parters'
personal assets and their interest in Princeton-Newport, should
those assets fall short of the amount the government wants to set
aside for possible forfeiture.
   That amount has not been disclosed but is believed to be between
$30 and $50 million.
   Defense attorneys have said only their clients interests in the
partnership could be subject to forfeiture.
   A federal grand jury in August indicted five Princeton-Newport
partners and a former Drexel trader on charges they engaged in a
racketeering conspiracy to create illicit tax losses through phony
stock deals.
   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office has said it expects to
issue a new indictment against them in late November, which would
replace the earlier indictment, but has not given details.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cincinnati Bell Inc. acknowledged Wednesday
that it faces three lawsuits alleging that company employees
illegally tapped customers' telephones.
   The phone company acknowledged the suits in a report to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Two fired former Cincinnati Bell employees, Robert Draise and
Leonard Gates, testified before a Cincinnati federal grand jury
earlier this month that they installed monitoring devices on
hundreds of business and private telephone lines as part of their
jobs for more than a decade, starting in 1972.
   They said people whose phones were tapped included business
executives, lawyers, police officials, a Black Muslim group and
U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin, chief judge in the federal southern
district of Ohio.
   Cincinnati Bell has repeatedly denied that it acted improperly
or that it ordered or authorized illegal wiretapping. The company
said it intends to vigorously defend itself.
   Among those who have sued Cincinnati Bell so far is Harold
Mills, a former Cincinnati police vice squad commander who retired
in January 1986.
   Cincinnati Bell said it has not been served with any summons,
but has learned that the lawsuit complaints are similar. Each suit
charges the company with having illegally engaged in wiretap
activities, violated federal and state laws, and wrongfully
intruded into the private lives of the plaintiffs.
   The three lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court for
southern Ohio. Each suit asks a total of $112 million in damages
from the company, Cincinnati Bell said in its SEC filing.
   Draise and Gates said they told the grand jury that some of the
taps were installed on company orders, while others were ordered by
the Cincinnati police and the FBI. Only a federal judge can
authorize electronic eavesdropping.
   Cincinnati Bell has said Draise resigned as a repairman in 1979
to avoid being fired after he was convicted of a federal
misdemeanor involving a tap on a friend's line. Gates has filed a
federal court lawsuit contesting his 1986 firing as a supervisor.
Cincinnati Bell said he was fired because he was hostile and
insubordinate.

   Fiat, Italy's largest private-sector
industrial group, said Wednesday that its consolidated pre-tax
profit rose by 21 percent in the first half of 1988 compared to the
first six months of 1987 to 2.2 trillion lire, or $1.5 billion.
   The company said group sales, boosted by the ``favorable
national and international situation,'' grew by 14.3 percent, to
22.68 trillion lire ($16.2 billion) in the six-month period.
   Senior analysts in Milan said Fiat results exceeded expectations.
   Fiat common shares rallied to 9,565 lire on the Milan stock
market Wednesday, from 9,480 lire the previous day, prior to the
company announcement as professional speculation went on a buying
spree to anticipate the satifactory results.
   IFI, the holding company of the Agnelli family which is Fiat's
largest shareholder, rose to 16,500 lire, from Tuesday's 16,240.
   Fiat, which has been investing heavily in automation and for the
takeover of Ferrari, the Italian maker of luxury and sports cars,
reported that its net indebtedness as of June 30 was around 400
billion lire ($285 million), slightly down from 424 billion lire
($302 million) a year earlier.
   Fiat posted consolidated profit of 2.3 trillion lire ($1.6
billion) for the entire 1987.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in lackluster trading
Wednesday as the British pound continued to draw most investor
interest.
   Gold prices also were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid of $397.75 for a troy ounce of gold, up 50 cents
from late Tuesday's $397.25.
   There was limited interest in the dollar, which traded within a
narrow range, and investors turned instead to higher-yielding
currencies such as the pound, said James T. McGroarty, a vice
president at Discount Corp.
   McGroarty said the dollar was caught between conflicting forces
_ economic fundamentals that should move it higher and the desire
of the major industrial powers to keep the currency at current
levels.
   On Monday, the central banks of several nations, including the
U.S. Federal Reserve, were reported to have intervened in
foreign-exchange markets, selling dollars to cap the currency's
rise.
   Overseas dealers said the Berlin meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank were not offering any news to
stimulate trading. Most of the top officials at the meeting were
merely calling for exchange-rate stability.
   In London, one pound cost $1.6840 late Wednesday, more costly
for buyers than late Tuesday's $1.6785. The pound also advanced
against the dollar in New York, rising to $1.6905 from late
Tuesday's $1.6780.
   The pound surged more than 2 cents against the dollar over
Tuesday and Wednesday following a better-than-expected British
trade deficit report for August.
   The British government said on Tuesday the deficit stood in
August at 1.813 billion pounds, or around $3.06 billion, the
country's second-worst monthly shortfall but down from July's
record 2.651 billion pounds.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar closed at 134.20 Japanese yen,
down from 134.58 yen. In London, the dollar traded at 134.20 yen,
and in New York, it slipped to 134.02 yen from 134.63 yen late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York Wednesday, compared with
late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.8767 West German marks, down
from 1.8780; 1.5897 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 6.3877 French
francs, down from 6.3915; 1,398.87 Italian lire, down from
1,399.42; and 1.2212 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2205.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's prices,
included: 1.8785 West German marks, down from 1.8790; 1.5920 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5910; 6.3980 French francs, up from 6.3945;
2.1182 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1185; 1,401.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,402.95; and 1.2215 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2185.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Bullion closed at $398.20 a troy ounce on New York's Commodity
Exchange, up from $397.30 late Tuesday.
   The closing price of gold in London was a bid of $396.50 a troy
ounce, up from $395.30 late Tuesday, while in Zurich, Switzerland,
gold was quoted at $394.90 bid, down from $395.75 on Tuesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $401.64, up from $401.16.
   Silver was unchanged at $6.166 a troy ounce on the Commodity

<HEAD>Platinum Advances On Tight-Supply Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices broke with the other precious metals
markets Wednesday and surged upward in reaction to forecasts for a
supply shortfall in the coming year.
   On other markets, gold and silver were mostly higher; sugar
futures fell sharply; frozen pork bellies plunged again; livestock,
energy, grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   A report by leading platinum refiner Johnson Matthey PLC saying
platinum demand could outstrip supply by 450,000 troy ounces in
1989 sparked buying of platinum futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, analysts said.
   The British company said supplies of platinum could remain tight
for the next five years.
   Platinum for delivery in October rose $8.80 to $494.40. October
platinum had finished below $490 in the three previous sessions as
the market mimicked the weakness in gold prices.
   The main buyers Wednesday were commercial consumers of platinum,
said Richard Levine, vice president of the precious metals and
foreign exchange group of Elders Futures Inc.
   ``This indicates a lot of consumers of platinum have been
waiting for a decline (in price) to cover their requirements. There
was a lot of forward buying going on,'' he said. ``I think they'll
still be there if the market goes back down.''
   Gold futures rose slightly on New York's Commodity Exchange but
the spot price remained below $400 a troy ounce. Gold, pressured by
slack demand in light of the low inflation rate, settled below $400
one week ago for the first time in 19 months.
   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York said slight increases in gold and silver prices this week
indicated the precious metals markets were consolidating and
possibly readying for a rally.
   But Levine noted that spot gold and platinum had not broken
through their respective barriers of $400 and $500 a troy ounce.
   Gold settled 80 cents to $1.20 higher with October at $398.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent lower to 0.8 cent higher with
September at $6.166 a troy ounce.
   Sugar futures prices fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange following a powerful rally on Tuesday.
   Erik Dunlaevy, a sugar trader with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New
York, linked the market's recent volatility to players scurrying to
close out their positions on the soon-to-expire October contract.
   Sugar settled .18 cent to .40 cent lower with October at 9.46
cents a pound.
   Frozen pork belly futures plummeted for the second straight day
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as traders sought to align
futures prices more closely with the lower cash market, said Tom
Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights,
Ill.
   Hog futures also retreated, possibly on selling by traders who
were rethinking their bullish projections for the Agriculture
Department's quarterly hogs-and-pigs report, which will be released
Friday.
   The report is a tally of the hog-and-pig herd in the 10 largest
pork-producing states.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed. Live cattle settled .30 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with October at 71.20 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .18 cent lower to .37 cent higher with September
at 80.17 cents a pound; hogs were .33 cent to .90 cent lower with
October at 39.02 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .95 cent
to 1.23 cent lower with February at 49.02 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices ended mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting generally bullish inventory statistics from
the American Petroleum Institute, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 11 cents
lower with November at $14.11 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with October at 39.50 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .60 cent higher with
October at 46.17 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade after a late selloff in the wheat market crushed a broad
rally.
   Most of the buying that had fueled the rally earlier in the day
was technically inspired, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 4\ cents to 7 cents lower with December at $4.16 a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 2{ cents higher with December at
$2.86{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to { cent higher with
December at $2.45{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to 5{
cents higher with November at $8.12{ a bushel.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for December delivery of Standard & Poor's 500
stocks settled 1.05 points higher at 271.55.

<HEAD>Maxwell Challenges Macmillan's Lock-Up Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British publisher Robert Maxwell went to
court Wednesday to challenge Macmillan Inc.'s $2.5 billion merger
ageeement with a major investment firm, charging that the bidding
process had been ``rigged.''
   A day earlier, Macmillan said it agreed to be acquired by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for $90.05 a share in cash and
securities. The bid was selected above Maxwell's latest offer, also
unveiled Tuesday, of $89 in cash for each of Macmillan's 27.8
million outstanding shares.
   Presenting their arguments to the Delaware Chancery Court,
Maxwell attorneys challenged Macmillan's ``lock-up'' agreement with
Kohlberg, which they said ensured the buyout firm would reap
Macmillan's ``crown jewels'' even in the event the firm did not
acquire the company.
   A hearing was scheduled for Oct. 10.
   Under terms of their merger agreement, Macmillan granted
Kohlberg an option to buy four businesses under certain
circumstances. Those businesses include Macmillan's direct
marketing group; the diretory division, which publishes Who's Who
and other directories; the Berlitz language schools; and Michie
Co., which publishes state legal codes.
   Supporting Maxwell's challenge was the Robert M. Bass Group of
Texas, which controls 9.2 percent of Macmillan and which sparked
the bidding war for the publishing and information services company
four months ago. The Bass group initially offered to acquire
Macmillan for $64 a share but backed out when the price began to
rise steeply.
   ``Bass seeks the right to choose for itself between the
competing offers, and the lock-up denies us of that ability,'' said
Josy Ingersoll, an attorney for Bass in Delaware.
   In filing a motion to intervene in Maxwell's case, Bass charged
that Macmillan directors ``breached their fiduciary duty to Bass
and other shareholders by granting the lock-up,'' Ingersoll said.
   Maxwell initially had filed suit challenging Macmillan's
``poison pill'' plan, which makes an unwanted takeover
prohibitively expensive. That suit was amended to include Maxwell's
request to block the lock-up agreement.
   Maxwell, head of Maxwell Communication Corp., had asked
Macmillan to conduct a fair auction, and ``thus far the auction has
been rigged,'' said Maxwell attorney Dennis Kelleher at the hearing.
   In addition to allegations that Macmillan had tied up its best
businesses, Maxwell has complained that Macmillan failed to honor
his request that he have an opportunity to top any bid the company
received.
   ``I am shocked that (they) would enter into this hasty,
ill-conceived ... junk-bond financed offer with KKR without even

   Maxwell said he believed members of the financial community
``have valued the Kohlberg bid at less than $89 a share.''
   In mid-September, the Macmillan board approved Kohlberg's
initial $85-a-share proposal but withdrew its backing last week
after Maxwell raised his offer to $86.80 a share from $80.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said Wednesday its
directors approved a shareholders' rights plan, commonly known as a
poison pill, to discourage unwanted takeovers.
   Chairman Walter Williams said the board not aware of any plan to
acquire control of the company.
   Should a person or group launch a tender offer or acquire 20
percent of Bethlehem's outstanding common shares, the rights plan
would enable shareholders to tie up blocks of stock and thereby
dilute the raider's holdings.
   The plan will expire in 10 years.

<TEXT>
   Union Camp Corp. said Wednesday it would
spend up to $700 million to expand its paper mill in Richland
County amid increasing demand for copier and computer paper.
   The expansion will increase the mill's daily capacity by 1,100
tons and boost its annual production to 640,000 tons per year,
almost triple the production rate now.
   Gene Cartledge, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Wayne, N.J.-based company, noted that ``uncoated business papers
have been one of the fastest-growing grades for the industry and
particularly for our company'' over the past decade.
   ``Our research indicates that pattern of strong growth will
continue into the future,'' he said.
   Union Camp estimates the demand for uncoated business paper,
including business forms, copier and computer paper, will grow in
the rate of 400,000 to 500,000 tons per year for the next decade.
   Among the improvements scheduled for the mill are modifications
to the existing paper machine to increase its capacity by 25
percent; building a second paper machine, and adding a pulp dryer,
said Bob Lambert, resident manager of the mill in Eastover.
   Work will begin immediately, and the expansion is to be
completed by 1991, Lambert said. Some 250 new jobs will be created.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Wednesday vetoed
legislation designed to toughen curbs on textile, apparel and shoe
imports, arguing it would have ``disastrous effects'' on the
economy at a time when exports are booming.
   Only minutes after rejecting the textile measure in private,
Reagan went before television cameras in the Rose Garden to sign a
bill paving the way for a multibillion-dollar free-trade zone with
Canada.
   In both cases, Reagan said he was acting to lower prices for
consumers and to ensure jobs for workers.
   The textile bill, intended to protect American industries
against foreign competition, won final congressional approval last
Friday.
   But Reagan, in a veto message released by the White House, said,
``This bill represents protectionism at its worst.''
   The measure won congressional approval without the two-thirds
margin needed to override a veto, and White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater expressed confidence that Reagan's veto would be
sustained.
   The House passed the bill by a vote of 248-150 on Sept. 23, and
the bill won Senate approval by a 59-36 vote on Sept. 13.
   The president lavished praise on the Canadian free-trade
agreement, calling it ``a hallmark of free trade'' and ``the
antithesis'' of the textile measure he'd just vetoed.
   But the treaty has no force as yet because it is bottled up in
the Canadian Senate and its fate depends on the outcome of the
Canadian election.
   ``Protectionism does not save jobs,'' Reagan said in his veto
message. He contended the textile bill ``would have disastrous
effects on the U.S. economy.''
   ``It would impose needless costs on American consumers, threaten
jobs in our export industries, jeopardize our overseas farm sales,
and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for
U.S. exports,'' Reagan said.
   ``At a time when American exports are booming, the United States
must not embark on a course that would diminish our trade
opportunities,'' he added.
   The president called the textile and apparel industries ``the
most protected sector of our economy'' and said they were
undeserving of further aid.
   Reagan charged that prices would climb and ``break the clothing
budgets of many American families'' if the legislation took effect.
   With every move that has arisen on Capitol Hill to strengthen
textile imports, Reagan has pledged to veto any resulting
legislation.
   ``For eight years this administration has pursued anti-worker,
anti-wages, anti-employment policies ... In vetoing this trade
bill, President Reagan refuses to give the textile, apparel and
footwear industries the time they need to prepare and modernize for
international competition,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, of the president's action.
   Fitzwater said Reagan vetoed the bill as soon as it arrived from
Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning.
   Asked about possible repercussions from the veto on Vice
President George Bush's election effort in the South, where even
some staunch Republicans back the bill, Fitzwater replied, ``It's
our belief that, politics aside, ... protectionism is the issue
here.''
   The bill would:
   _Freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels this year and
limit growth to 1 percent annually starting in January.
   _Freeze imports of non-rubber footwear with no provision for
increases.
   _Impose import quotas on 180 categories of textile products and
30 types of footwear, a system that would be reviewed after 10
years.
   _Set up a one-year program under which the government would
auction off import licenses and set a special quota for silk
neckties.
   Anticipating the veto, Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said Friday
that he expected Congress to mount an effort next week to override
Reagan's action.
   The House approved the bill on a vote of 248-150 on Friday.
Earlier this month, the Senate approved the measure, 59-36.
   The textile and apparel industries, along with a number of
unions and their congressional allies, called the bill vital to
stemming job losses. They point to the loss of more than 400,000
jobs in the 1980s when a surge of imports hit the U.S. market.
   While acknowledging that industry earnings have recovered
somewhat, they say profits have dropped again, imports still are
flooding American markets, and plants still are closing.
   But the measure's critics _ including retailers, importers and
the administration _ dispute those claims and warn that new curbs
would trigger retaliation against U.S. exports.
   The opponents contend the industry is flourishing because of
increases in efficiency and automation sparked by increased
competition.
   The free trade agreement with Canada was approved by the Senate
on Sept. 19 by a vote of 83-0.
   The bill calls for a 10-year phase-out of tariffs and a number
of other trade curbs under the pact signed in January by the
president and the Canadian prime minister.
   The president's signature clears the way for U.S. action in
phasing out tariffs on $131 billion in merchandise that crosses the
U.S.-Canada border each year.
   The agreement was approved this year by the Canadian House of
Commons, but leaders of the the Canadian Senate have said they will
delay action until Prime Minister Brian Mulroney holds an election.
There is speculation in Canada that Mulroney will call an election
for late November. He is four years into his term and is a strong
supporter of the agreement.

   The Senate approved and sent President Reagan
on Wednesday the first major revision of the nation's pesticide
control law in a decade, calling for speeded up safety reviews of
some 600 farm chemicals.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
told a news conference after Senate approval on a voice vote that
the measure ``gives us a solid start on the long walk toward
pesticide reform.''
   He and Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., a co-sponsor, acknowledged
the measure was silent on key provisions urged by a broad spectrum
of environmentalists. But the two lawmakers called the bill the
best that could be achieved with only weeks remaining before
lawmakers go home for the year.
   The legislation is a response to years of warnings from
environmental groups. It would set a nine-year deadline for safety
reviews that otherwise would not be completed until the year 2024,
according to an estimate by the General Accounting Office.
   Pesticide manufacturers would assume most of the financial
burden of the testing process through fees designed to raise $160
million.
   Under the three-year reauthorization of the 1947 Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the chemical
companies that manufacture pesticides also would pay for storage
and disposal of the chemicals. The obligation currently is that of
the federal government.
   So-called indemnity payments that have cost the EPA $20 million
to buy up stocks of banned pesticides also would be phased out
under the bill, at least as they apply to manufacturers.
   So-called end users, however, still would receive indemnity
payments under the measure as would chemical companies that already
are slated to receive them as a result of action already taken by
the EPA.
   Concern over the pesticide issue stems from research findings
that some pesticides cause cancer, birth defects and other severe
health problems. The chemicals are an outgrowth of World War II
chemical warfare research and are widely used throughout U.S.
agriculture.
   Traces of pesticides are found in many foods on the American
dinner table.
   Missing from the legislation was any provision dealing with the
growing problem of pesticide contamination of ground water.
   The Capitol Hill-based U.S. Public Interest Research Group said
in a report two weeks ago that 73 pesticides were found in ground
water in 34 states, according to an inspection of EPA records. The
agency said that some of the findings may have been false alarms
but that the basic range was correct.
   Ground water provides the basic drinking supply for an estimated
113 million Americans, and environmental groups have been pushing
for a provision to safeguard ground water.
   The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee considered
such bill earlier this year but it was not contained in the version
approved by the House last week.
   In its action, the Senate merely approved the House-passed bill
and sent it on to the president's desk. Because of the absence of a
ground water provision, environmentalists were only lukewarm toward
the legislation.
   ``As passed, the bill does not even qualify for a bronze
medal,'' said Rick Hind of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
``On a scale of one to ten it deserves a three and is appropriately
dubbed FIFRA Lite.''
   ``This gives Congress another excuse to postpone important
issues like ground water, farm worker safety and food safety,'' he
added.
   Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, told lawmakers that
the measure represented the best compromise obtainable as a divided
Congress pushed toward adjournment in perhaps three weeks.
   Five leading members of the Senate Agriculture Committee
circulated a letter to lawmakers this week urging them to vote for
the measure because it represented the only realistic way to get
``simple but significant'' action on the pesticide issue in this
Congress.
   Environmentalists have been pushing for changes in FIFRA since
1962 when naturalist Rachel Carson sparked interest in the issue
with her bestselling ``Silent Spring.'' Congress has acted several
times since then but little has been accomplished in the realm of
reviewing pesticide safety and only three such chemicals have been
fully banned.

<HEAD>Eastern To Boost Winter Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite massive service cutbacks for
fall and the layoffs of more than 3,000 employees, Eastern Airlines
President Phil Bakes announced a 10 percent increase in flights
this winter.
   Bakes said flights would be added to the carrier's schedule Nov.
1 and Dec. 15, but would not elaborate about the increases.
   The increases would be in Eastern's ``core'' markets along the
East Coast and in Latin America, company spokeswoman Paula Musto
said Tuesday. She ruled out a return to cities Eastern recently
abandoned.
   While company officials said it was too early to talk about
possibly recalling laid-off workers, union leaders said Eastern has
to bring back some workers if it plans flight increases.
   ``The problem is the rest of the work force has been cut down to
the bone,'' said John Knudson, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots
Association.
   The Miami-based carrier earlier this month closed its Kansas
City hub, halted service to 14 cities and eliminated 4,000 jobs.
More than 3,000 people have been laid off, with others targeted for
leaves of absence or early retirements.
   Many of its 3,500 pilots are owed thousands of hours of vacation
time, much of which will be deferred until 1989 so as to boost
flights this year, Bakes said.
   Bakes announced the increases to a meeting of travel agents here
in a move to reassure agents that Eastern can overcome bitter
negotiations with its unions over contract concessions and
financial problems.
   The airline has $400 million in cash, Bakes said, enough to
compete effectively in its traditional East Coast and Latin
American markets.
   ``We intend to spend it as we have been _ on our very basic
business,'' Bakes said.
   But union officials point out that Eastern has loaned $40
million to its sister carrier Continental Airlines and they allege
that asset sales are designed to diminish the union's influence.
   The unions have challenged Eastern's layoffs and cutback plans,
and a federal appeals court in Washington is expected to rule on
the layoffs this week.

<TEXT>
   A New York bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved
an additional $82.75 million in out-of-court settlements reached by
Manville Corp. with 15 insurance carriers in asbestos-related cases.
   The cases involve asbestos-related coverage provided to Manville
from July 1980 to July 1983.
   Manville already had won bankruptcy court approval of more than
$770 million in out-of-court settlements with insurance carriers
for other asbestos-related coverage. The latest settlements bring
the total of such insurance settlements for Manville so far to more
than $850 million.
   Manville has been operating under federal bankruptcy law
protection since August 1982.
   Its reorganization plan requires insurance funding of $615
million to fund the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust,
established to compensate people who have or will become ill from
exposure to asbestos.
   Insurance proceeds in excess of the $615 million will go to the
Asbestos Property Damage Trust.
   The company cannot consummate its reorganization plan until one
remaining appeal, currently pending in the U.S. Supreme Court, is
exhausted.

<HEAD>Attorneys Start Again in Battle Over Audis, Sudden Acceleration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Audi of America Inc. and 300,000
Audi 5000 owners were back at the starting gate Wednesday, in court
on a legal fight over allegations of sudden acceleration.
   ``We're back to square zero,'' said Jerold S. Solovy, a Chicago
lawyer representing Audi.
   To settle a class-action lawsuit, Audi had agreed to give a
credit ranging from $300 to $2,000 toward the purchase of a new
Audi, but Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas R. Rakowski rejected the
agreement on Aug. 11, saying people would only benefit if they
bought another car.
   Audi has now declared that rather than negotiate further, it
will defend itself at a full trial that attorneys said may not
start for a few years.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group,
contends that 402 people have been injured and five have been
killed in at least 1,650 accidents in which an Audi 5000 surged
after being shifted from park into gear. Audi denies there is
anything wrong with the cars.
   Attorneys representing as many as 300,000 former and current
Audi 5000 owners are seeking compensation from the company, saying
bad publicity over sudden acceleration has reduced the car's resale
value.
   Wednesday's court hearing was mostly a procedural matter in
which Rakowski asked attorneys to draft motions on how many people
should be covered in the new class of plaintiffs.
   Some attorneys will ask Rakowski to include people who say they
were injured or had property damaged by Audi 5000s that suddenly
accelerated.
   ``Personal injury claims are not suited to class-action
treatment,'' Solovy said. ``I predict it will go down in flames.
   ``The class would have been much better served if the settlement
was approved,'' he said.
   The next hearing date was not set but is not expected for months.
   Audi, based in Troy, Mich., defends the Audi 5000.
   ``It's a good car. It's a safe car. Everyone should buy it,''
Solovy said. ``It's a silly case. If the federal government doesn't
think this is an unsafe car, how will plaintiffs prove it?''
   Robert F. Lisco, one of the chief attorneys representing current
and former car owners, does not believe people who claim personal
injury or property damage should be part of the lawsuit.
   ``I think it will cause more problems than it solves,'' Lisco
said.
   The Cook County case involves cars built between 1978 and 1986.

   Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. will
apparently become the first major U.S. cigarette company to import
a brand for distribution when it test-markets a Danish product in
Arkansas.
   The ``full-flavored, non-menthol'' cigarette will be sold under
the brand name Prince and will be available in Little Rock, Ark.,
beginning next Monday. The price will be the same as for other
Brown & Williamson brands.
   Prince, made by Scandinavian Tobacco International, is sold in
30 countries.
   Brands sold in the United States by the nation's two largest
cigarette makers _ R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris _ are made
domestically, company spokesmen said.
   Brown & Williamson decided to introduce the cigarette in the
United States because consumers are looking for new products, said
B&W spokesman Michael Bateman.
   Prince, which also comes in a ``light'' version, is aimed at
smokers who want a name-brand cigarette and is promoted as the
``cigarette that doesn't cut corners on taste.''
   B.A.T Industries PLC of Britain is the parent of both
Scandinavian Tobacco and Brown & Williamson.

   Labor negotiators for heavy machinery giants
Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Co. are trying to replace separate
contracts that expire simultaneously at midnight Friday, and avert
a strike by more than 30,000 United Auto Workers members in seven
states.
   Even as tentative local contract agreements were reached
Wednesday in York, Pa., Memphis and Denver, strike preparations
were under way at Caterpillar sites at 12 cities in Illinois, Iowa,
Colorado, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
   ``I've got my picket line duty roster made out, my picket duty
captains scheduled for 42 shifts and our picket signs ready,'' said
Paul Mantzke, vice president of UAW Local 145, which represents
Caterpillar workers in Aurora.
   Mantzke said his 2,445 members are opposed overwhelmingly to any
contract extension and are getting restless as the deadline
approaches.
   ``I'd say we're going to be going out,'' he said.
   ``People here are getting ready for a strike,'' said Ed Woker at
Local 751 in Decatur, which represents 1,978 union members. ``It's
the only recourse we have. Negotiations have gone on long enough.
Maybe they need something to knock them off dead-center.''
   The rank and file has authorized a strike if no new agreement is
reached by midnight Friday. A walkout would idle 17,500 union
workers at Caterpillar.
   Caterpillar, the world's biggest maker of earth-moving
equipment, employs nearly 59,000 people worldwide.
   ``At this point, we still believe there's a good chance we can
reach an agreement by Friday,'' said Caterpillar spokesman Mark
Polzin. ``We intend to keep meeting and we are working toward that
end. The two parties continue to come together in good faith.''
   In Moline, union negotiators expressed confidence that a
settlement with Deere was imminent.
   UAW negotiator Jim Hecker said Tuesday he was optimistic an
agreement would be reached by Friday. He said the strike
authorization by Deere's union members was a routine part of the
negotiating process.
   ``We're at the proper point we should be at this stage in the
negotiations,'' Hecker said.
   Deere spokesman Robert Combs declined comment on the status of
talks.
   ``There's not much to say,'' Combs said. ``The two parties are
meeting all week and continue to meet on a regular basis.''
   Negotiations with Deere, the giant of farm tractor and
agricultural implement manufacturing, have been underway steadily
since Aug. 11.
   The Deere talks affect about 13,400 active employees, and 4,000
laid-off workers, at 11 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota,
Colorado and Georgia. Deere employs about 38,000 people worldwide.

   Tax shelter promoter John Peter
Galanis was sentenced Wednesday to 27 years in prison for
masterminding multi-million dollar fraud and racketeering schemes
from coast to coast.
   A federal court jury on July 5 convicted Galanis, 45, formerly
of Greenwich, Conn. and now of Del Mar, Calif., on 44 various
counts of participating in a racketeering enterprise that looted
banks, fleeced investors and defrauded the government of taxes.
   In a prepared statement for the court, Galanis admitted he was
responsible for what happened.
   ``My arrogance did not allow me to fully examine the events
through another's eyes,'' he said. ``I thought of myself as a kind
man, imparting good values, not a racketeer.''
   The government in a lengthy presentence report contended Galanis
``directed a sophisticated criminal enterprise, consisting of a
cohesive group of associated individuals and entities...whose
activities defrauded investors, financial institutions and the
public'' of $150 million in a series of schemes over a period of
years.
   Galanis took most of the money ``to support the extravagant
lifestyle to which he had become accustomed during his decades of
unrelenting criminal activities,'' the report said, and learned no
lesson from a previous conviction of conspiracy to violate
securities laws.
   ``This sentence, which is, in my experience, the heaviest yet
imposed for white collar crime, sends precisely the right message
to wealthy and privileged crooks who cheat to make additional
millions upon millions,'' U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said after
sentencing.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Brieant sentenced Galanis, who had
faced a maximum penalty of 207 years in prison and $8 million in
fines.
   Brieant last week sentenced Galanis' co-defendant, Anthony
Marchese, 48, of Southport, Conn., to 20 years in prison.
   The judge agreed to allow Galanis to remain free on $20 million
bond, over the government's objections.
   Galanis allegedly masterminded a phony oil- and gas-drilling tax
shelter scheme that netted more than $172 million in fraudulent tax
writeoffs for about 2,500 investors.
   The so-called ``Galanis organization'' also left a Rockland
County bank insolvent, fraudulently took over a Westport, Conn.
bank, forced Utah banking officials to take over another financial
institution in Salt Lake City, and stole $3.9 million from three
California mutual funds.
   The Galanis organization allegedly bribed officials of the
Peoples National Bank of Rockland County in Monsey, N.Y.,
fraudulently took over Heritage Bank in Salt Lake City, seized
control of Columbia Federal Savings Bank in Westport, Conn. through
fraudulent misrepresentations to federal regulators and illegally
took over ISI Mutual Funds in Oakland, Calif. and stole $4 million
in mutual fund assets.
   Peoples National Bank collapsed in 1985 and was taken over by
the First National Bank of Highland Falls while in 1987 Heritage
Bank came under the control of the state of Utah.
   Eleven other people pleaded guilty for their roles in Galanis'
various schemes and nine testified against him, said assistant U.S.
Attorney Vincent Briccetti.

   A Dallas judge summarily ruled in favor of Hunt
Oil Co. Wednesday in a $1 billion suit accusing the company of
scheming to deprive other oil companies of oil and gas concessions
in North Yemen.
   Arabian Shield Development Co. of Dallas and Dorchester Master
Limited Partnership of Houston filed the suit against Hunt Oil,
Chairman Ray L. Hunt and Yemen-Hunt Oil Co. last October.
   Arabian Shield is an energy and mineral company controlled by
Dallas businessman Jack Crichton and some Saudi princes.
   Crichton alleged Hunt and his partners in 1981 acted wrongfully
to deprive the plaintiffs of an exclusive contract to explore and
produce oil and gas in a 140,000-square-mile tract in the Middle
East nation and to win the rights for themselves.
   The Hunts accused Crichton and his partners of filing a baseless
suit to achieve economic rewards they were unable to win through
direct negotiations with the Yemeni government.
   A motion for summary judgment was filed in July by the Hunt firm
and heard in August by 116th District Court Judge Frank Andrews.
   ``We feel the decision by the court to grant our motion for
summary judgment is a total and unqualified vindication,'' Ray Hunt
said in a news release.
   Hunt noted that several weeks after the suit was filed the Yemen
Arab Republic government officially refuted the allegations.
   Ray Hunt is half-brother to Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert
Hunt and Lamar Hunt, but operates a separate energy and real estate
empire. He is not involved in the three Hunt brothers' financial
travails.
   Andrews also ruled the defendants were entitled to recover all
legal costs incurred in the suit.
   Crichton, 47, was a personal friend of Hunt's late father, H.L.
Hunt, and a former board member of the Hunt family foundation.
   Arabian Shield and Dorchester plan to appeal the judgment in 30
days, according to a statement issued by Arabian Shield.
   ``This is only the first round in a fight in which Dorchester
and Arabian Shield intend to pursue until Arabian Shield-Dorchester
have recovered the damages suffered...from the illegal actions of
Hunt Oil Company in securing the oil production sharing agreement
in North Yemen,'' the statement said.
   The Alif Field was developed in North Yemen in 1984 by Hunt Oil.
   The plaintiffs claimed Crichton and several associates first
found evidence of oil reserves in North Yemen in 1955 and signed an
agreement with the governement. But political turmoil, including a
lengthy civil war, prevented development of the tract.
   An updated agreement negotiated in 1981 by Dorchester and
Arabian Shield _ the legal successors to the parties given the 1955
contract _ was awaiting final approval of the North Yemeni
government when it suddenly was canceled, the suit said.
   Hunt Oil, through its Yemen-Hunt Oil Co. subsidiary, then was
awarded a contract for rights to the tract in September 1981, the
suit alleges.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Zenith's Motion to Dismiss Brookhurst's Case</HEAD>

   A federal court judge on Wednesday
dismissed a motion that would have given a group of dissident
shareholders leverage to depose Zenith Electronic Corp.'s board of
directors.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph J. Farnan dismissed the challenge
from Brookhurst Partners because he said federal court did not have
jurisdiction over the subject matter.
   Brookhurst spokesman Tom Franco said the group would sue Zenith
in Delaware state court, ``which we believe to be the correct
forum.''
   Brookhurst is seeking shareholder support to dump seven of
Zenith's 10 directors, trim the board to six members and fill three
of those seats with nominees committed to selling the television
and computer maker.
   Brookhurst had asked the court to strike down a company bylaw
that requires approval from all shareholders _ not just a majority
_ for such a move.
   Zenith, which is incorporated in Delaware but based in Glenview,
Ill., unilaterally agreed Monday to such a change. But Franco said
the company's action was not enough, and Brookhurst still was
seeking access to the company's shareholder lists and financial
records.
   ``There are other claims and we believe that they remain worthy
of the court's consideration,'' Franco said in a telephone
interview Wednesday night. ``We're hopeful that there will be a
prompt resolution of the remaining claims.''
   Franco said the group would file a motion Thursday in Delaware
Chancery Court seeking to exempt Brookhurst's solicitation from
Zenith's ``poison pill'' takeover defense.
   The plan now gives Zenith the right to dilute its holdings if
any one shareholder gains consent for change from 15 percent of the
shares.
   Brookhurst is a limited partnership that owns 6.1 percent of
Zenith stock, which makes the group the company's largest
stockholder.
   Zenith stock rose 50 cents to $20.62{ a share Wednesday in New
York Stock Exchange trading.
