   Police arrested 12 men, including an
opposition party leader, in foiling a plot to overthrow the
government and assassinate President Samuel Doe, Information
Minister Emmanuel Bowier said Tuesday.
   Bowier told a news conference seven plotters were still at
large, including an army captain and two sergeants.
   He said those arrested included Gabriel Kpolleh, leader of the
banned Liberia Unification Party, party lawyer Cephar Mbandi and
four soldiers, .
   The minister said the plot was uncovered on March 16. He said it
was a conspiracy ``to destabilize the government, create internal
strife and overthrow the government by assassinating the president
of Liberia.''
   Bowier said arms, ammunition and military uniforms were found in
a building in the Sinkor district of Monrovia.
   Investigations continued but the situation was under control, he
said.
   Bowier read from a prepared statement and declined to answer
questions. Journalists were warned not to run editorial comments or
cartoons on the plot before the defendants go on trial. The
minister gave no court date.
   The Unification party on Monday released a statement expressing
concern over the arrests of Kpolleh and Mbandi. It said several
properties owned by Kpolleh and his family were destroyed during
investigations by security forces and that his wife narrowly
escaped being raped. It did not elaborate.
   Bowier advised reporters not to believe any press releases
issued by the Unification party, saying it was banned and its
statements had no credibility.
   Doe, who came to power in a bloody April 1980 coup, has been the
target of several assassination attempts. An attempted coup on Nov.
12, 1985, resulted in more than 600 deaths and the destruction of
the village of the ringleader, former Brig. Gen Thomas Quiwonkpa,
who was killed in the attempt.
   Quiwonkpa, who had been living in exile, led the attempt
following elections that opposition leaders and independent
observers said were rigged.
   Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, was founded in 1847 by freed
American slaves. Descendents of the slaves, who were a minority,
controlled the government until Doe, from the Krahn ethnic group,
stormed the presidential mansion in April 1980, killing
then-President William Tolbert.
   The economy declined under the rule of the former army master
sergeant. Major Western creditors suspended aid to Liberia pending
payment of debts. Last year the United States sent 17 financial
experts to Monrovia to oversee operations of the Finance Ministry.

   President Reagan sought Tuesday to revive his
stalled effort to aid the Nicaraguan Contras and said congressional
Democrats will be to blame if the supply-starved rebels fade from
existence.
   In an hour-long meeting on Capitol Hill, Reagan appealed to
Republican House members to unite behind a new effort to push
through Congress some kind of help for the Contras, whose last U.S.
aid ran out Feb. 29.
   Later, speaking at a fund-raising reception for the re-election
campaign of Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., the president, as he has
before, linked last week's incursion into Honduras by troops of
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government to the defeat of his
request for funds for the rebels.
   ``The logistical preparation for the incursion began just after
Congress voted to reject our package of aid to the democratic
resistance,'' he said. ``This was a precise and carefully planned
operation that showed the influence of outside advisers and must
have required several weeks to plan.''
   Rebel supporters said their chances of prevailing on the
divisive issue were improved by the incursion, which was making
some moderates nervous about leaving the rebels without aid.
   ``Some were quite pale in their appearance when they realized
there was this incursion,'' said Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
chief House GOP vote counter. ``We think there is some potential
there to get a few more votes than we had in the past.''
   One member of the ``swing'' group, Rep. Buddy MacKay, D-Fla.,
said he was preparing a compromise aid package and was seeking the
support of other moderates. ``All we are trying to say is that
leaving the situation as it is, is unacceptable,'' MacKay said.
   ``We are determined to get continued assistance to the
resistance, and if we stick together, this time we'll make it,''
Reagan told the closed meeting with lawmakers, according to a text
of his remarks provided by the White House. He declined to offer
details on what kind of package he was asking for.
   Alluding to Democratic efforts to thwart any military aid for
the Contras, Reagan added: ``Those who led the fight against our
package of assistance to the democratic resistance cannot escape
responsibility'' if the rebel forces wither.
   Later, in a session with local-government Republican officials,
the president again pointed the finger of blame at House Democrats.
   ``The House leadership, who played hardball to win the vote to
cut off aid, now says it won't accept responsibility for the
destruction of the freedom fighters. But if the freedom fighters
are extinguished and communist rule is consolidated in Nicaragua,
the American people will be the ones to decide who is
responsible,'' he contended.
   Democrats immediately tossed the blame back, insisting that it
was Republicans who were responsible for the narrow House defeat of
a package of strictly ``humanitarian'' aid _ food, clothing,
medicine and shelter _ on March 3.
   ``What we're seeing is a public relations campaign here,'' said
Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif. ``The Republicans are very nervous about
it because the finger's pointed right at them.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, renewed his offer to vote
quickly on a package of purely humanitarian aid if Republicans will
ask for discussions. But he said any proposal containing military
equipment would be subject to normal committee review.
   ``The door is open, the welcome mat is laid,'' Wright said.
   The continued wrangling seemed to make the rebels themselves
despair of any quick action to renew the money flow, and they
released a television advertisement to begin airing this week that
makes a direct appeal to U.S. viewers for contributions.
   ``Your Congress abandoned us,'' Ernesto Palazio, a Washington
lobbyist for the rebels, says somberly in the spot. ``We have
nowhere to turn but to individual Americans like you.''
   The spot, which asks for money for ``medicine, blankets and food
for our families and children,'' was to begin running this week in
Washington, Charlotte, N.C. and Fort Worth, Texas _ Wright's home
town.
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll of 1,007 Americans found that 55
percent of those surveyed opposed Reagan's dispatch of U.S. troops
last week to train in Honduras, and 62 percent thought the troops
would become involved in the fighting. The margin of error was plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
   The poll, conducted by telephone interviews Thursday through
Monday, found that 40 percent of those surveyed favored aid to the
Contras and 56 percent opposed it. It was the highest support
figure since the 43 percent level recorded on July 15, 1987, the
day after former White House aide Oliver North testified before
Congress.
   The White House has encouraged a bipartisan group of Contra
supporters in the Senate who are proposing a one-year, $48 million
package of non-lethal aid that also would give the CIA the right to
deliver previously stockpiled weapons. Under that plan, the
president also would have the right to get a quick vote in Congress
on sending new military aid under certain conditions.
   MacKay's version, still being drafted, would contain a
compromise on Reagan's future ability to demand a quick vote. In
contrast with the Senate bill, MacKay's would let the president
trigger an expedited vote, but would not let him dictate the kind
of aid package to be voted on. That would be left to normal
legislative procedures, he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters after
Reagan's Capitol Hill visit that the administration has not yet
aligned itself with any specific bill, but would like to have a
package introduced soon and a vote before Congress leaves next week
on an Easter recess.
   ``We'd like to have a vote before then,'' Fitzwater said.
   But House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois said it
would be difficult to bring the matter to a vote before the week of
April 11, when Congress returns to session.

<HEAD>At Geneva Talks on Afghanistan, Attention `Centers On Washington'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez spoke Tuesday of the
slow pace of Afghanistan peace talks in Geneva, but cautioned that
lack of quick movement does not mean a stalemate.
   Negotiators at the U.N.-sponsored talks apparently were waiting
for new signals from the Washington meeting between Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Secretary of State George P.
Shultz.
   Cordovez met with the Afghan delegation for less than 30 minutes
Tuesday and with the Pakistani team, which speaks for the Afghan
guerrillas, for more than an hour. He later spoke briefly to
reporters, admitting that there was ``very slow progress'' but that
it ``should not be confused with a deadlock.''
   There was a short-lived rumor that the Afghans, led by Foreign
Minister Abdul Wakil, were preparing to leave Geneva Wednesday. But
a Pakistani negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the talks would proceed on schedule.
   Wakil said earlier there was no reason for suspending the talks.
Pakistan's chief representative, acting Foreign Minister Zain
Noorani, has said Pakistan was prepared to stay in Geneva ``as long
as it takes'' to conclude a peace settlement.
   The talks are stalling over the question of what Afghan
government should oversee implementation of the settlement and over
future Soviet military aid to Kabul.
   The United States demands that Soviet assistance cease at the
same time as U.S. aid to the anti-Marxist guerrillas fighting the
Soviet-backed Kabul government. Moscow has rejected this as
interference in relations between two sovereign states.
   ``Attention now centers on the discussions in Washington,'' a
Pakistani source said.
   Noorani said last week that the superpowers may ``at least find
it easier to settle among themselves'' the aid issue.
   The Soviet Union intervened militarily in Afghanistan at the end
of 1979 to support the government in its fight against the Islamic
guerrillas. Approximately 115,000 Soviet troops are still there.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev says he wants to withdraw the
Soviet troops from Afghanistan this year if agreement can be
reached at Geneva.

<HEAD>Dissident Editor Jailed on Charges of Defaming Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military prosecutor on Tuesday jailed
Francisco Herreros, director of the leftist magazine Cauce, for
purportedly defaming Chile's armed forces in an editorial, a
magazine spokesman reported.
   Herreros was taken to Santiago's main prison after being
questioned by prosecutor Luis Acevedo, according to Alvaro Briones,
a senior Cauce editor.
   Under Chile's military government, the armed forces codes
empower prosecutors to indict and jail civilians brought before
military courts.
   The editorial written by Herreros and published by Cauce in June
1987 criticized the influence given to the military courts in
recent years.
   According to lawyers and human rights activists, more than 90
percent of those tried by military courts in the last five years
were civilians, including a number of journalists.
   Acevedo has five days to file formal charges against Herreros or
release him, according to the military code.
   The suit against Herreros was started by the army.
   Chile has been ruled by the armed forces since a coup ousted the
elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende in
September 1973.

   The Army successfully test-fired
five Pershing 2 missiles slated to be banned from deployment under
a treaty with the Soviet Union.
   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, does not require either side to withdraw or
destroy missiles until it has been ratified by both governments.
The Senate is expected to approve the pact in late spring.
   The unarmed missiles were successfully fired Monday under
battlefield conditions, the Army said.
   The Pershing is a field missile _ each of which costs $4 million
_ launched from its own assembly that can be carried by a truck.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, calls for
the destruction of all missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.

   NBC, predicting its biggest season win yet,
continues to add potentially successful new series to its schedule,
while CBS, facing its first last-place ratings finish ever, can't
get its new comedies arrested.
   ABC fared best with new fare last week, adding the critically
praised nostalgia comedy ``The Wonder Years'' to the A.C. Nielsen
Co. top 10. NBC's pilot for ``In the Heat of the Night'' tied for
15th in the rankings, though it remains to be seen how the series
will do on a weekly basis.
   CBS, meanwhile, failed with its attempt to add new comedies to
its Monday and Tuesday nights. The best performer was ``Eisenhower
& Lutz,'' which ranked 31st.
   For the week that ended Sunday, NBC had an average, prime-time
rating of 15.8; CBS 12.9 and ABC 12.6. With four weeks left in the
season, NBC leads with a 16.3, ABC 13.9 and CBS 13.6. CBS would
have to beat ABC by two points a week to tie for second. CBS has
never finished a season in third place in the 35 years that Nielsen
has done television ratings.
   The ``CBS Evening News,'' however, was still in first place,
with an average rating of 11.6. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a
10.8 and ``NBC Nightly News'' 9.7.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions.
   Here is last week's top 10: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``A
Different World'' NBC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS,
``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``The Wonder Years'' ABC,
``Night Court'' NBC, ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS and ``Growing
Pains'' ABC. Half of the top 10 shows were repeats, as the
networks, faced with a strike by scriptwriters, began to conserve
new episodes for the May sweeps.
   CBS added ``Eisenhower & Lutz'' to its Monday night lineup,
moving ``Frank's Place'' to Tuesday, where the rest of the lineup
dragged that critically acclaimed series down to 65th of 77
rankings. The other new comedies CBS tried on Tuesday were
steamrollered by ABC's normally strong lineup, including ``The
Wonder Years.'' It replaced ``Growing Pains,'' which moved to
Wednesday night where it continues to be a top-10 show.
   CBS' ``Coming of Age,'' starring Paul Dooley as an acerbic
former airline pilot struggling to adjust to a sunny retirement
village, was 59th. At a dismal 75th was ``My Sister Sam,'' a
formerly high-rated comedy reprised by CBS to fill in for the new
``The Dictator,'' which was delayed by the Writers Guild strike.
``Trial and Error,'' a Hispanic ``Odd Couple,'' was 76th.
   NBC did well with a TV version of the classic film ``Inherit the
Wind,'' starring Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas. It ranked 14th.
   ``In the Heat of the Night'' was a pilot for a potential fall
series starring Carroll O'Connor and Howard Rollins in a remake of
the hit movie.

<TEXT>
   The destruction of millions of acres of
tropical jungles each year by peasant farmers and others is a
problem for the developed nations as well as the Third World and
requires economic and educational solutions, say scientists at a
leading plant research institution.
   The Missouri Botanical Garden, known for its man-made tropical
atmosphere in the so-called ``Climatron'' designed by Buckminster
Fuller, is working to halt the decimation of the world's real
tropical jungles.
   ``The outlook is pretty grim,'' said biologist Peter H. Raven,
director of the garden. ``Although tropical forests once covered at
least 12 percent of the globe _ an area about twice the size of
Europe _ they have already been reduced to about half that.''
   ``Currently, the forests are being cleared or degraded at the
rate of about 60 million acres a year. That's an area about half
the size of California.''
   Raven said roughly half of all known plant and animal species on
Earth are found in the tropical forests. At the current rate of
destruction, as many as 60,000 species of plants will be extinct by
the year 2020.
   ``The plant-rich tropics supply man with a wealth of food crops,
medicines and other useful products,'' said Dr. Enrique Forero,
director of research at the garden. ``But they are being destroyed
rapidly.''
   The chief culprits, Forero said, are loggers and slash-and-burn
peasant farmers. The loggers obviously need the trees to stay in
business and the farmers often have to destroy the forests to feed
themselves and their families.
   And the scientists say the situation can only get worse unless
something is done to stop it.
   ``At present, over half the people in the world live in
countries that are at least partly tropical, excluding China,''
Forero said. ``Nearly a third of these people are already living in
extreme poverty and with current rates of growth, the human
population of these countries will double in less than 30 years.''
   ``How can you tell these starving people that you are going to
save the very things they have to destroy in order to sustain their
already meager existence,'' asked Raven. ``Education and political
and economic stability are obviously the keys. That and
understanding.''
   Which is why, Raven said, the garden has committed itself to an
all-out effort to explore, document and save the forests.
   With a staff of 70 researchers and technicians, including many
who live permanently in the tropics, the garden makes up one of the
world's largest active field research programs in tropical botany.
   The goals, the scientists said, are to collect the plant species
before they become extinct and to teach the impoverished farmers
how to live in the forest without destroying it.
   With the growing knowledge of genetics, they said, it is
important that the genes, the biological blueprints, of the
endangered species be saved.
   ``To lose this genetic capital through massive extinctions just
as we are developing our capabilities to explore its potential
would indeed be a tragedy,'' Raven said. ``The developments in
genetics make the specter of extinction even worse,'' Raven said.
``For each species of plant or animal lost to extinction, you're
losing the potential for another 20,000 to 30,000 variants in the
future.''
   Many of the plants, scientists say, could almost certainly be
developed into cheaper, easy-to-grow sources of highly nutritious
food. Others could be converted into abundant sources of new
medicines.
   Another important part of the garden's program is to lend
technical assistance to and train scientists from developing
tropical countries through cooperative agreements.
   ``Unfortunately, only 6 percent of the scientists working on the
problem live in the countries involved,'' Raven said. ``We must
change that. Momentum to implement the innovative conservation and
development strategies needed to deal with these urgent problems
ultimately must come from the affected countries themselves,''
Raven said.
   The backbone of the garden's research, the scientists said, is
its herbarium, or plant collection. Along with the New York
Botanical Garden and the Smithsonian Institution, the Missouri
herbarium is one of the three largest in the United States and
among the 12 largest in the world.
   Started by garden founder Henry Shaw in the 1850s, the Missouri
herbarium now contains samples of more than 3.5 million species and
is expected to expand to 4.5 million within the next decade.
   Pointing to a large map showing the locations of the garden's
researchers in Central and South America and Africa, Raven said of
the encroachment on the forests: ``It won't be stopped soon.
   ``But there are encouraging signs. What people have to learn is
that conservation and development are really two sides of the same
coin.''
   ``Producers and consumers have to learn that they have a common
problem. It can all be done, but it won't be easy.''

   An old generation is remembering the Vietnam war
and a new generation is curious, stirring a revival of the
controversial era in books and movies. Now comes a new publication,
a slick magazine simply named Vietnam, whose premiere issue went on
sale today.
   ``Our timing could not have been better because right now, look
at all the Vietnam movies that have come out,'' said publisher
Gregg R. Oehler in a telephone interview from Leesburg, Va., where
the magazine is published by Empire Press. ``Look at all the major
emphasis now on video, on books. It's Vietnam. Everyone now is
talking about Vietnam.''
   Oehler said 150,000 copies of the first issue were printed,
including 50,000 for subscribers and 100,000 for newsstand sales
across the United States and in 16 other countries. The magazine, a
quarterly, sells for $2.95 a copy on newsstands and for $9.95 for
the four issues by subscription.
   Oehler said the response has been so overwhelming from
wholesalers, subscribers and the media that the magazine will
probably go to six issues a year in 1989. Many of the subscribers
are Vietnam veterans, a large number of them in prison.
   ``I've gotten hundreds of letters from Vietnam veterans in
prison,'' said Oehler. ``They're so happy to hear that a magazine
is coming out.''
   Each issue will run 68 pages with a regular format of four
feature stories and six departments including editorial, fighting
forces, bases and installations, arsenal and book reviews.
   The initial issue includes an interview with Gen. Fred C.
Weyand, America's last military commander in Vietnam, and a story
on Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the command center for America's forces
in Vietnam which was called the ``Pentagon East.'' It also includes
32 pages of color photographs and maps. The cover shows two
soldiers defending their post with a machine gun.
   In the editorial in the premiere issue, the editor, retired Col.
Harry G. Summers Jr., explains the goal of the magazine:
   ``Thirty-eight years after American involvement in Vietnam
began, 15 years after the withdrawal of all U.S. military forces
there, and 13 years after the fall of Saigon, the war there truly
remains an enigma. The goal we here at Vietnam magazine have set
for ourselves is to find the key to unlock that enigma.''
   In an interview, Summers said that in visits to colleges he has
found great interest in Vietnam among young people who want to know
what really happened there. He said there seems to be a
misunderstanding of the war especially among this generation, many
of whom were not even born when American soldiers were pouring into
Vietnam in 1965.
   ``There is the perception that the United States was defeated by
a guerrilla army,'' he said. ``That's not true. The American
military withdrew from Vietnam 2{ years before the fall of Saigon.
The North Vietnamese did not defeat the American military when they
seized Saigon for a very simple reason: There was no American
military there to defeat. One of our objectives is to refute some
of the myths.''
   Summers, 56, is widely known and respected as an authority on
military affairs. He served in both the Korean and Vietnam wars.
   He is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, a
contributing editor for U.S.News & World Report, and the author of
two books, including the widely acclaimed ``On Strategy: A Critical
Analysis of the Vietnam War.''
   The magazine's editorial review board includes Gen. William C.
Westmoreland, former commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, and
authors Stanley Karnow and Al Santoli, both of whom have written
books on Vietnam.
   Asked if the presence of Westmoreland and other former Vietnam
officers on the board will leave the impression that the magazine
will give only the official view, one that was often discredited
during the war, Summers said:
   ``We've tried to get the voices as diverse as possible. I don't
think Stanley Karnow's an apologist for the war. I don't think I'm
an apologist for the war. Certainly my book was very critical of
the war. And so was Al Santoli.''

   Ben Midgette bends and removes spikes from
railroad ties, and Rod Korthals blows smoke through a scale-model
hog house.
   They are among 3,000 scientists, administrators and graduate
assistants on staff at the University of Illinois Agricultural
Experiment Station, which celebrated its 100th anniversary Monday.
   But the center, one of 66 in the country, is about more than
agriculture.
   ``I've yet to see one person ... who didn't think there were
exciting things going on here,'' said station director Donald Holt.
``One thing is clear _ research is crucial to the future of
American agriculture and our society in general.''
   In one laboratory, Midgette compared the strength of railroad
ties made from different woods, looking for the longest-lasting
material. An African oak was so hard that it caused a bolt to break
in a machine that measures the force required to pull out a spike.
   ``It snapped and went straight up,'' said Midgette, who figures
this African oak will out-last conventional ties. ``We've got
indentations in the ceiling.''
   Korthals pumped smoke into the clear plastic model of a hog
house to demonstrate how the air moves through the building with
various ventilation systems. He said it should help farmers select
the most efficient design for their own swine buildings.
   The 320 research projects funded by the station last year
involved subjects such as agricultural economics, veterinary
medicine, home economics and food science.
   The center has a $25 million budget from state and federal
appropriations, as well as gifts, grants and contracts, many from
the private sector, Holt said.
   It began in the Morrow Plots, site of the longest-running
continuous corn experiment in the Western Hemisphere. The test
plots were created in 1876, the year Gen. George Custer and 264
cavalrymen were killed at Little Bighorn.
   Much of the station's research still is aimed directly at
production agriculture. Visitors on Monday saw a rainfall simulator
used to study the effects of soil erosion, experiments on the
biological control of insects, and research into the possible use
of wild soybeans to improve commercial varieties.
   They also saw work being done to create new human foods from
soybeans, to study tree growth and to learn more about infant
nutrition and child development.

   The murderous rampages that left five people dead
at two Belfast funerals last week have aroused fears that Northern
Ireland is sliding into a new cycle of violence after several years
of relative calm.
   In the past month, 15 people have died _ twice the 1987 monthly
average. The dead include three Irish Republican Army guerrillas
gunned down in Gibraltar on March 6 in the incident that touched
off the latest mayhem in Belfast.
   ``A firm grip will be required to halt the slide of the province
toward still further bloodshed and anarchy,'' the News Letter, a
Belfast newspaper, warned Monday.
   ``There is no time to lose,'' said the Belfast Telegraph. ``If
there is a political vacuum _ and there is _ the initiative will
always seem to be with the paramilitaries.''
   ``There won't be anarchy and there won't even be a return to the
level of violence in the early 1970s when 700 people died in a
year,'' Paul Bew, a political science professor at Queen's
University in Belfast, said in an interview.
   ``But the graph is starting to go up, up, up,'' he said.
   With police talking of about 30 suspects in Saturday's violence,
Roman Catholic areas of Belfast are bracing for a wave of arrests
that could provoke further clashes.
   Ever since the Irish Republican Army's struggle to drive Britain
out of Northern Ireland climaxed with the death of 10 hunger
striking prisoners in 1981, the province seemed to be lapsing into
relative calm. The death toll was dropping steadily and there even
were signs of economic rejuvenation.
   The IRA, having narrowly failed to assassinate Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher with a bomb in 1984, was suffering repeated
military and political setbacks. The Anglo-Irish Agreement of
November 1985, which gave Dublin a say in the running of Northern
Ireland, was bolstering Catholic moderates against IRA radicals.
   The killing of the three guerrillas, allegedly as they were
plotting a car bombing in Gibraltar, was portrayed by Britain as a
triumph for its anti-terrorism strategy.
   But the fact that the guerrillas were unarmed outraged many
Catholics as well as the Irish government. That reaction in turn
angered many Protestants, who believed that the IRA got what it
deserved.
   As the three were being buried, Protestant Michael Stone emerged
from behind a tombstone lobbing grenades and firing into the
mourners. Three died and 68 were wounded.
   Three days later, at the funeral of one of the cemetery victims,
a car sped toward the cortege. The mourners, keyed up and fearful
of another Protestant attack, pounced on it.
   When they realized the occupants were two British soldiers, they
dragged them out, beat them with iron bars and stripped them. The
two men were then hauled away and shot dead by IRA gunmen.
   The two episodes revealed the hatred that can still erupt from a
Protestant majority that regards itself as being under siege, and
from a Catholic minority for whom Gibraltar proves there is no
British justice in Northern Ireland.
   The incidents all but obscured four other deaths since
Gibraltar: a policeman, an IRA man and two civilians _ a Protestant
woman and a Catholic man.
   In the context of a conflict that has claimed 2,638 lives since
1969, those four would be regarded as par for Ulster's grisly
course. The funeral deaths, however, were graphically captured by
TV cameras, and they stunned and disgusted Irish and British
citizens alike.
   ``Scum of the earth,'' stormed the Sun, a London daily. In
Dublin, the Irish Press lamented: ``This was the shocking face of
Ireland '88.''
   Many Catholics reacted to Saturday's killings with shock and
disgust, making no attempt to excuse them as a response to the
previous cemetery bloodbath. The Irish News, a Catholic daily,
called it ``a satanic rejection of the Christian faith.''
   ``The initial reaction is shock that something so barbarous
could happen,'' said Dan Keenan, spokesman for the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, Northern Ireland's moderate, mainstream
Catholic party.

   Don Hewitt, who marks his 40th anniversary with
CBS News today, recalls that he landed his first job at the network
after a friend suggested his experience at a newsphoto service
might come in handy.
   ``I said, what does CBS want with picture experience? Radio
doesn't need any pictures. He said, `No _ television.' I said
whata-vision?''
   Today, the 65-year-old outspoken creator and executive producer
of ``60 Minutes'' is looking beyond current television technology,
foreseeing a time when networks are superfluous and television news
is beamed directly into subscribers' homes.
   Hewitt began his career as associate director and later producer
of the network's first television newscast, ``Douglas Edwards With
the News'' and later the ``CBS Evening News'' with Walter Cronkite.
   He remembers covering the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II with
Edward R. Murrow and flying back to the United States aboard a
chartered airliner editing the kinescope that viewers would see on
the news _ no videotapes, no satellite transmissions.
   ``I didn't think there was ever going to be satellites, bounce
signals off a star, are you crazy?,'' he said, laughing. But
Hewitt, who considered buying CBS News a few years ago, thinks it's
feasible to one day broadcast news directly to homes. News services
already are beaming footage to local television stations, so
Hewitt's idea is not so far-fetched.
   ``I think that the network news departments, they might not even
work for a network 10 years from now,'' he said. ``There might not
be any networks because it may be an outmoded delivery system.
   ``I'm not sure you don't have a large newsroom somewhere and you
just have direct broadcast ... feeding news into people's homes,
for a price same way they pay for a newspaper.''
   He also foresees delivering newspapers into home printers by
satellite.
   ``I think about it more than most people, as you can see. And I
wonder how long the networks in their present form will be
around,'' he said.
   Some other samples of Hewitt's opinions:
   _``60 Minutes'': ``I've always said all we do in this broadcast
is shine lights on people in dark corners, and if people in dark
corners are doing things they shouldn't be doing, all we did was
turn the light on.''
   _The importance of pictures on television: ``The accepted wisdom
in television was always you put words to pictures. I don't believe
that. You put pictures to words. You start with the words. The
audio is always more important to me than the video.''
   _Televised presidential debates (Hewitt produced the famous 1960
meeting of Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy): ``It's still a
terrible format and we shouldn't be doing them. They should have
real debates. ... The Republican candidate and Democratic candidate
should head up a team of two or three debaters who are really good
and can really cross-examine the other side and give them a hard
time, and they ought to do it in front of a joint session of
Congress, and it will produce something other than this sterile
show where what it is is a joint press conference, not really a
debate.''
   _This year's election: ``I don't think there's enough caffeine
in America to keep the electorate awake during a Dukakis-Bush
campaign.''
   _Politicians: ``I don't put politicians on the air if I can help
it, because I instinctively don't believe them. I believe they're
only interested in getting themselves elected, and they only say
what they think will get themselves elected.''
   _Ratings: ``No matter what I think about ratings, and whether
they're accurate and everything, I don't say anything because
they've been awfully good to me.''
   _The future: ``I know where I'll be in nine years. I'm going to
be here. My contract isn't up until I'm 74. Ironclad, nobody gets
out. Now the question is, will there be a CBS? I think so. Some
form. Maybe not this form.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Considering Major Child Abuse Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is considering whether
abused children should have the right to sue public officials for
failing to protect them from their parents.
   But the justices have decided to avoid another children's rights
issue: whether public school students enjoy any constitutional
protection against paddling or other corporal punishment by
teachers and administrators.
   The court announced Monday that it will tackle the parental
abuse issue in the case of a Wisconsin boy, Joshua DeShaney, who
suffered serious and permanent brain damage from beatings by his
father.
   The boy's suit accuses social workers and officials of gross
negligence in ignoring evidence that he was being brutally
victimized. A lower court threw out the suit.
   A high court ruling is not expected until 1989 on whether to
revive the suit against the Winnebago County, Wis., Department of
Social Services and two of its employees.
   The agency was accused of violating the rights of Joshua by
failing to rescue him from his father's beatings, even though it
allegedly had known about the abuse since 1983, when the child was
4 years old.
   Joshua has been institutionalized since 1984, suffering from
injuries that destroyed half his brain and left him profoundly
retarded.
   The boy's father, Randy DeShaney, since has been convicted of
child abuse and sentenced to two to four years in prison.
   DeShaney's ex-wife, Melody, sued the social services officials
on grounds they violated the child's constitutional right not to be
deprived of liberty without due process.
   Mrs. DeShaney was divorced from her husband and living in
Cheyenne, Wyo., when she was informed her son had suffered serious
brain damage. DeShaney had custody of his son.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in throwing out Mrs.
DeShaney's suit, said the social welfare agency and its employees
``though blameworthy, did not cause Joshua's injuries'' but
``merely failed to protect him from his bestial father.''
   The appeals court also said welfare agencies should not be
placed in the predicament of removing a child from home and facing
suit by the parent or leaving the child there and risk being sued
by the child.
   Putting officials in that position ``is unlikely to improve the
welfare of American families and is not grounded in constitutional
text or principle,'' the appeals court said.
   In the paddling case, the court, without comment, let stand a
federal appeals court ruling in a New Mexico case that ``at some
degree of excessiveness or cruelty'' such punishment violates
constitutional rights.
   Another appeals court has rejected that view, clouding the
picture.
   The high court in 1977 ruled that such disciplinary measures
never can amount to the ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by
the Constitution's Eighth Amendment.
   The decision barred students from suing teachers and school
administrators in federal court over alleged Eighth Amendment
violations, but left them free to sue in state courts under state
laws.
   In the 1977 decision, however, the court said it had not
considered whether corporal punishment can violate ``substantive
rights under the (14th Amendment's) due process clause.''
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last April cleared the
way for a trial in Teresa Garcia's federal lawsuit against Penasco,
N.M., school officials over two paddlings she received in
elementary school.
   The appeals court said the kind of punishment alleged in the
lawsuit can sustain a federal lawsuit even if a lawsuit could have
been filed in state court.
   In other developments, the court:
   _Agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed to
promote competitive bidding on government contracts. At issue is
the proper boundary between presidential and congressional power.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Texas whether states may impose
sales taxes on most books, newspapers and magazines while exempting
religious publications.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Did Thomas Jefferson Invent The News Leak?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a capital institution, leaking confidential
information to the press has a rich heritage and long roots.
   Those roots may be longer than one might think.
   The news leak, in fact, may stretch back to Thomas Jefferson, or
at least his political allies.
   That possibility was made clear last week as the Senate was
reminded that the day marked the 188th anniversary _ March 18, 1800
_ of the issuing of the very first contempt of Congress citation.
   Thomas Duane, editor of the Philadelphia Aurora, was cited for
contempt for having failed to appear as ordered to explain how he
had obtained the text of a controversial but secret Senate bill and
caused it to be published.
   The Senate in that era still met in secret and all of its
deliberations were held to be private, not public, matters.
   According to Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and
Senate historians, the secret bill was the product of the Senate's
Federalist majority and concerned a bid to change the method of
settling disputes over presidential electors.
   Jefferson was vice president and leader of the
Democratic-Republican Party. His supporters feared a plot to deny
him the presidency in the upcoming elections.
   So, Dole said, ``Jefferson's allies in the Senate leaked a copy
of the bill to William Duane.''
   ``Offended Federalists demanded an investigation of Duane and
his illicit sources,'' Dole said.
   Vice President Jefferson, as the Senate's presiding officer, was
directed to read Duane a list of prepared questions about who had
given him the bill, he said.
   Duane asked for additional time to seek counsel, a request
Jefferson quickly granted.
   ``That was the last the Senate saw of William Duane,'' Dole
recounted. ``When he failed to reappear, the Senate issued a
contempt citation in his name. Duane hid out through the remainder
of the congressional session.''
   When the new Congress convened the situation had changed.
Jefferson had won the White House and his party had captured
majorities in both the Senate and House.
   ``Needless to say,'' said Dole, ``the new Senate majority had no
intention of pursuing charges of contempt against William Duane.''
   The first congressional investigation of a news leak was quietly
shelved.

   Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., sifted through 40 years of memories
last week after announcing he will end his congressional career at
the end of the year.
   Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, presided
over the hearings which, on July 24, 1974, resulted in a vote to
impeach President Richard M. Nixon.
   Within days Nixon resigned his office.
   A decade later, on May 30, 1984, Rodino was en route from the
capital to his home in Newark, N.J.
   Rodino is such a frequent flier on that route that the airlines,
as a matter of courtesy, customarily assigned him a seat in the
second row of the aircraft so that he could board and depart easily
and quickly.
   But on the day in question, Chairman Rodino got bumped to the
rear of the plane.
   Who had the clout to oust Rodino from his accustomed seat?
   Former President Richard Nixon's the one.
   Nixon also had a home in New Jersey and was traveling with his
Secret Service bodyguards. The entire group got the
front-of-the-plane seats.
   The two men didn't talk.
   ``I didn't even see his face,'' Rodino recalled. ``I saw the
back of his head.''

   As struggling Democratic presidential
hopeful Richard Gephardt was wooing workers at a giant steel mill
here with his trade-and-populism message, one of them handed him a
button that read: ``Survival.''
   The button referred to saving McLouth Steel through employee
ownership, but it also aptly summed up Gephardt's political goal in
Michigan.
   Without a win here, it could be all over for the Missouri
congressman. But he hopes workers like the ones he campaigned among
Monday will keep his bid alive.
   ``If we don't do well here, obviously we aren't going to be able
to continue the race,'' Gephardt said in Lansing on March 10.
   Brushing aside questions about his future if he loses, Gephardt
said over and over again Monday, ``I'm going to do well in
Michigan.'' Asked if he would run for re-election to his House seat
if he loses Saturday, he declared: ``I'm going to win.''
   ``I imagine he does have to'' win, said Frank Kelley, Michigan
attorney general and chairman of Gephardt's effort in the state.
   But he was quick to say winning might not mean coming in first.
Kelley said Jesse Jackson, who has strong black support in Detroit
and its suburbs, could be first. He said Gephardt must beat
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the front-runner in delegates.
   ``If Gephardt beats Dukakis, his campaign is revived,'' Kelley
said.
   But the polls do not support that prospect.
   A survey conducted March 15-17 for The Detroit News gave Dukakis
and Jackson the lead, with Gephardt far behind. Dukakis had 33
percent, and Jackson 31 percent. Gephardt had 10 percent, with the
rest of the field trailing.
   Gephardt said the polls do not tap the caucus-goers accurately,
as the campaign expects only 100,000 to 150,000 Democrats to
attend, a small fraction of the party faithful.
   ``I think a lot of people will be surprised by how well he does
here,'' said Chick Mahoney, owner of Chick's Rooster Lounge south
of Detroit, where Gephardt campaigned Monday. ``But it's going to
be tough.''
   To turn the poll findings on their head, Gephardt has a message
with a great deal of appeal in this state still shuddering from the
massive changes in the auto and steel industries facing foreign
competition.
   He denunciation of foreign trade practices _ epitomized by his
rhetoric and ad saying ``a $10,000 Chrysler K-car costs $48,000 in
South Korea'' _ draws big applause from blue collar crowds. At the
McLouth mill and at Chick's on Monday, that line drew big cheers.
   ``He's the only one to take a stand on trade, a strong one,''
said Jim Hindman outside the McLouth mill south of Detroit.
   ```Some of the people here were out of work for 4{ years,''
added Ray Ridings. ``That's why we like Gephardt.''
   Gephardt is short of time and money to get his message out.
Kelley said the campaign has promised to spend between $300,000 and
$500,000 on ads in the state. One campaign aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity said, ``As fast the money comes in, we spend
it.''
   A key to Gephardt's victory is what the union leadership does in
the state.
   The United Auto Workers have not endorsed anyone nationally,
although their state affiliate in Iowa played a major role in his
victory in Iowa.
   That means Gephardt is trying to pick up support local by local
and district by district. At the McLouth plant, he won the backing
of district director Harry Lester. And Frank Baker, a United Steel
Workers Local 2659 official, said many members will follow the
district leader's suggestion.
   That backing must be repeated over and over again across the
state for Gephardt to win, for this caucus is not a simple process.
   The voting does not take place in the usual precincts across the
state but in 567 locations that may not be familiar to the voters.
That puts a premium on organization, which has been the trademark
of Dukakis' effort this far.
   Gephardt's Hyundai ad, which worked so well in Iowa and South
Dakota, has come in for criticism in this state where autos are the
economy.
   Gephardt brushed aside suggestions the ad is inaccurate in its
claim that the $10,000 Chrysler car would cost $48,000 in South
Korea. And he got some help in that from Chrysler Corp. chairman
Lee Iacocca, with whom he met on Monday in Highland Park.
   Asked if the Gephardt ad's figure was correct, Iacocca said
Gephardt has the point correct, whatever the details.
   ``Damn close to it. Maybe it's only $35-40,000, but don't lose
sight of it, it's still a big difference between $7,000 here for a
comparable car,'' Iacocca said to reporters outside the Chrysler
Corp. headquarters.
   Gephardt said he was responding to a story in Monday's editions
of The Detroit Free Press saying a K-car would cost about $33,000
in Korea and that none is sold there. And Gephardt, in an interview
with the Detroit News, conceded that many of those taxes are levied
in Korea on domestic consumption.

<HEAD>Banning Reporters Won't Necessarily Ease Israeli Image Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banning reporters and photographers from the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip could prove to be a public relations
blunder for Israel and might not be effective anyway, several media
observers say.
   Larry Gross, a professor at The Annenberg School of
Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, said it would be
``bad policy'' for Israel to impose more restrictions on reporters
covering unrest in the occupied territories.
   ``It would be a public relations risk _ one I hope they don't
take,'' Gross said. He said Israel could jeopardize its reputation
as the only true democracy in the Middle East, which U.S. officials
cite in providing millions of dollars to the country each year.
   But the Israelis are obviously watching the situation in South
Africa to determine if the advantages of restricting the press
outweigh the disadvantages, he said.
   South Africa's widely condemned white government has succeeded
in dampening outside interest in that country's racial problems by
banning coverage of any security activities, experts agree. The
order went into effect in June 1986.
   But Gross doubted Israel would be able to ``keep the lid on''
coverage of the occupied territories in a way the South Africans
have virtually halted reporting in black areas.
   Israel's domestic political opposition and a thriving domestic
press could prevent a blackout on coverage of the territories, he
said.
   Local Israeli army commanders already have authority to close
areas in the occupied territories at random, and they have been
doing so with increasing frequency. A parliamentary committee in
Jerusalem is studying whether to ban the media formally from the
territories.
   Yael Dayan, a well-known Israeli peace activist, said during a
recent U.S. visit that tough restrictions on the press would likely
fail, because Israelis demand news and have an aggressive press
corps.
   Eric Goldstein of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New
York-based group that monitors conditions for journalists
worldwide, said Israel might be able to stave off intense scrutiny
by banning cameras.
   ``But in the long run the greater public interest is served by
allowing the press access,'' he said. The committee opposes
restrictions on reporters.
   Some Americans have joined Israeli government officials in
complaining that reporters, particularly those working for foreign
television networks, have helped incite rock-throwing Palestinians
in the territories.
   New York Mayor Edward Koch has said a television ban would be
justified, and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
reportedly told prominent American Jews during a meeting that
banning television cameras would be a good idea. Kissinger says his
remarks were distorted.
   Jeff Cohen of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting criticized a
``censorship lobby'' for supporting restrictions that, in the
United States, would be considered an unacceptable violation of
freedom of the press.
   ``It would be one more comparison with South Africa, and it
would hurt Israel,'' he said. FAIR is a liberal New York group that
examines the media.
   Fred W. Friendly, former president of CBS News and a professor
at Columbia University's School of Journalism, said it would be
wrong to ban reporters from the occupied territories.
   ``That can't be right _ that's what South Africa did,'' he said.
   But Friendly said television coverage, with its time constraints
and powerful pictures, can fail to portray a story accurately.
`What is also wrong is letting the picture run away with the
story,'' he told The New York Times.
   Mortimer Zuckerman, editor-in-chief of U.S. News & World Report,
had the same complaint. ``Television has polluted the public debate
because it is inherently difficult for pictures to give context,
history and meaning to events,'' he recently wrote.

   Two Chicago & Northwestern freight trains
collided head-on Monday, injuring eight workers, three of them
seriously, police said.
   An eastbound train with four engines and about 130 cars collided
with a westbound train consisting of a switch engine and a single
car while both trains were going 20 mph to 30 mph, police said.
Officials were investigating the cause of the accident late Monday.
   The collision occurred about noon in the southwest part of
Dixon, a town of 15,000 in north-central Illinois, and the crash
could be heard up to a mile away, police said.
   Eight employees were on the trains at the time of the accident,
and were taken to Katherine Shaw Bethea Hospital in Dixon.
   Steve Wilkerson, 35, of Rock Falls; and Charles Holdren, 56 and
Robert Fonder, 38, both of Sterling, were listed in serious
condition late Monday, hospital officials said. The other five
workers were treated and released.

   Because senators like to see farmers smile,
your next Mercedes Benz could cost an extra $1,800.
   If you don't get the connection, that's just the way Congress
works sometimes.
   The Senate Finance Committee voted Monday to grant farmers and
some other taxpayers relief from the 15.1-cent-a-gallon tax on
diesel fuel used for logging, farming, oil drilling, mining,
fishing and other off-the-road business purposes.
   But since budget constraints require that every dollar of tax
relief be offset by a dollar of tax increase on somebody else, the
committee's bill would double the tax on fuel-guzzling cars _
mostly expensive imports whose miles-per-gallon don't meet federal
standards.
   Other sources of revenue for the diesel relief and a new
``taxpayer bill of rights'' include a few distilleries that dodge
some of the $12.50-a-gallon tax on liquor by watering down products
with a grape-based alcohol, and any number of people whose tax
refunds could be grabbed to pay an overdue government loan.
   After all that, farmers may have to wait six months for their
tax relief. There is some doubt Congress can complete action on
legislation before April 1, when off-the-road diesel users are to
begin paying the tax. They would have to wait for a refund until
they file their income-tax returns next year.
   ``I just don't want to go back home and explain to my farmers
why we've set up this ridiculous bureaucratic nightmare,'' moaned
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., noted the Senate is due to recess
Easter week. To go back home with no settlement of the farmers'
problem, he said, ``would be like us walking through a field of
scorpions barefooted.''
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said the committee should, in effect,
ask the Senate to ignore the budget problem so farmers can be
relieved.
   Farmers and other off-road diesel users were caught up in
Congress' efforts last year to reduce cheating on the fuel tax. The
solution was to change the point of tax collection to the producer
or wholesaler, and to require that those legally entitled to an
exemption pay the tax and then apply for a refund when they file
their income-tax returns the following year.
   The typical farmer would thus allow the government interest-free
use of $320 of his money, some of it for up to a year.
   The panel's bill does nothing for another big group with a
complaint: about 82,000 state, county and city government units
that, starting Jan. 1, are now having to pay the 9.1-cent gasoline
tax and apply for a refund later.
   The Finance Committee package, still subject to action by the
Senate and House, would:
   _Allow diesel bought for off-road business use from wholesalers
to escape the tax altogether. Tax-exempt buyers from retailers
would have to pay the tax and get a refund next year. This would
cost the government $543 million through 1993.
   _Create a ``taxpayer bill of rights,'' clamping down on
perceived abuses by the Internal Revenue Service. This would lose
$517 million over five years.
   _Extend through June 30, 1989, the expiring authority for the
IRS to withhold tax refunds from people who owe student loans, farm
loans and other federal debts. This would raise about $400 million.
   _Double the tax on new cars whose fuel efficiency does not meet
federal standards, raising $375 million through 1993. In the
current model year, the tax hits only expensive foreign cars, such
as the $38,000 Volvo 780, which gets 21.2 miles per gallon, and the
$61,130 Mercedes 560SL. Their guzzler taxes would rise to $1,300
and $3,600, respectively.
   _Limit use of a ``wine flavors credit'' under which some
manufacturers of distilled spirits avoid a significant share of the
$12.50-a-gallon liquor tax by mixing some products with a
grape-based alcohol. This is expected to raise $360 million over
five years.

   Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson, faced with bumping up against the federally-imposed
campaign spending limit, revised some of his state spending figures
downward in his newly filed campaign financial statement.
   The spending allocations for nine states showed lower cumulative
expenditures in the report filed Monday than the figures Robertson
reported a month earlier.
   Robertson's staff did not return a phone call Monday to answer
questions about the revisions.
   In his report filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission,
the former TV evangelist reported he had spent $19 million through
Feb. 29 against the spending cap of $23 million that applies to
expenditures for the entire primary season.
   Even with the downward revisions in some state spending figures,
the total was still more than the $17.6 million in spending against
the cap that he reported through the end of January.
   Candidates who receive federal matching funds must agree to stay
within the spending limit. The reports candidates filed Monday show
new financial activity for the month of February as well as
cumulative totals.
   Robertson's revisions were in figures reported for Califonria,
District of Columbia, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.
   The biggest was in Texas where his previous report showed an
allocation of $1.1 million, but the new report shows an allocation
of $746,514 through February.
   Robertson, who has spent more overall than any other candidate,
also reported he borrowed another $1.9 million in February.
   He has taken out more than $9 million in loans since he began
his campaign last year, and ended February with $8.4 million in
debts and $7.4 million in cash on hand.
   Financial reports filed by his rivals show that Sen. Bob Dole
also has narrowly outspent Vice President George Bush, as Bush has
built a huge lead over both Robertson and Dole in the GOP race.
   Democratic contender Michael Dukakis, the governor of
Massachussetts, continues to raise more money than his rivals, all
of whom have resorted to borrowing.
   Dukakis raised $2.9 million in February, including federal
matching funds, compared with less than $2 million each by Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, and Jesse Jackson.
   Gephardt borrowed and repaid $149,000, during February, Simon
borrowed $292,352, and Jackson borrowed $500,000. Gore did not take
out loans in February, which is the month covered by the new
financial statements. But his aides have said he borrowed $1
million before the March 8 Super Tuesday contests in 20 states, and
$300,000 before the Illinois primary March 15.
   Dole's receipts for February were $2 million, giving him $8.8
million for the year, including federal matching funds based on
contributions raised privately. Bush raised $1.5 million during
February, $8.7 for the year, his report shows.
   But despite raising and spending more money through February,
Dole failed to interrupt the Bush push toward the August nominating
convention in New Orleans. Bush has won 788 delegates so far to
Dole's 178, according to The Associated Press delegate count.
   Robertson raised $5 million for the month, including his $1.9
million loan, which brought his total receipts this year to $18.3
million.
   For the month, he spent $3.1 million, to Dole's $5.3 million and
Bush's $4 million.
   Dole has spent $18 million against the spending camp, and Bush
$14.1 million.
   Dole ended February with $836,445 in the bank and $716,107 in
bills. Bush had $6.7 million in cash on hand _ more than any other
candidate in the race _ and had $251,225 in debts.
   Among Democrats, Gephardt ended February with $1 million in
debts and only about half that in available cash.
   Simon was $825,199 in debt, and had $760,755 in cash on hand,
the reports showed.
   Jackson owed $845,857, and had $428,420 on hand.
   Gore had $342,964 in the bank and $91,858 in debts. But that was
before Gore took out $1.3 million in loans during March, according
to capaign aides. Figures detailing those transactions will appear
in the financial reports due next month.
   Candidates who run up debts generally do so in the knowledge
they will be receiving federal matching funds to help pay off the
loans.
   Dukakis had $2.9 million in cash on hand at the end of the
month, and $569,344 in debts.
   Dukakis was the Democrat closest to the spending cap, at $11.4
million.

<HEAD>Utility Moving To Boil Away Contaminated Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the Three Mile Island nuclear
plant has taken the first step in a plan to dispose of 2.3 million
gallons of contaminated water that is a legacy of the 1979 accident
at the plant.
   GPU Nuclear, operator of the plant near Harrisburg, Pa., said
Monday it is spending $800,000 for a system to boil away the water,
even though that method has yet to be approved by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and public hearings are months away.
   ``We expect the NRC to approve the evaporation eventually, but
it's possible that that wouldn't happen,'' GPU Nuclear spokesman
Gordon Tomb said Monday in a telephone interview.
   Tomb identified the contractor as Pacific Nuclear Systems Inc.
of Federal Way, Wash.
   NRC spokeswoman Sue Gagner said utilities commonly make major
expenditures for equipment before the commission grants permission
for its use.
   GPU Nuclear said the NRC might not consider the plan until
December and the utility wants to be ready when approval comes.
   But Kay Pickering, spokeswoman for Three Mile Island Alert, a
citizens' group, said she was alarmed when GPU Nuclear told the NRC
at a meeting last week that the company had authorized the
contractor to design, install and begin testing the evaporation
system.
   ``This is very distressing to the individuals and organizations
involved here,'' she said.
   Most of the water is left over from the 1979 accident, while
some has been used to decontaminate the plant. GPU Nuclear said the
average additional radiation exposure from the evaporation would be
about the same as ``the exposure from one to two hours of natural
background radiation in the Harrisburg area.''
   The $7 million process involves boiling the water into steam
released from a 100-foot-high stack, and packaging impurities for
shipment to a low-level radioactive waste dump. Tomb said testing
at the plant would not use radioactive water.
   Thomas Gerusky, a member of a citizens' advisory panel on the
TMI cleanup and director of Pennsylvania's Bureau of Radiation
Protection, said some area residents ``were concerned about any
releases from TMI'' and favored leaving the water in storage tanks.
   He said the NRC has given its blessing to the evaporation plan,
but the commissioners have withheld formal approval pending public
hearings.
   Disposal of the water is part of the $1 billion cleanup of Three
Mile Island 2. During the accident, uranium fuel was allowed to
lose the vital coolant that covers it, causing material in the core
to begin melting.
   GPU Nuclear announced plans in December 1986 to place Unit 2 in
storage indefinitely. The NRC is expected to issue a report next
month on whether the ``monitored storage'' plan poses any threat to
the environment, Michael Masnik of the commission said Monday.
   While there are no plans to restart TMI-2, its twin reactor was
not harmed in the accident and resumed operating in October 1985.

   Widespread publicity about a handful of sexual
abuse cases involving day care centers may have caused parents to
be more worried than necessary about the safety of their children,
researchers say.
   A study released Monday by the Family Research Laboratory of the
University of New Hampshire estimated that substantially more
children are abused at home than in day care settings: 8.9 per
10,000 children at home compared with 5.5 per 10,000 at day care.
   David Finkelhor, who directed the study, said the results are
``a far cry'' from the impression many people have gotten because
of news accounts about a few incidents of child abuse at day care
centers.
   ``We do not think day care centers in general are high risk
areas,'' said Finkelhor.
   However, he emphasized that child abuse does occur at some day
care centers and is particularly hard to ferret out because the
perpetrators do not fit stereotypes.
   Only 8 percent had prior arrest records, 50 percent were college
graduates and 40 percent were women, he said.
   ``We just can't say there is a nice shortcut, a couple of easy
rules to spot places that might be dangerous,'' he said.
   For example, Finkelhor noted, the study found no signficant
differences between the incidence of child abuse in centers with a
high teacher-to-pupil ratio and in less adequately staffed centers.
   However, Finkelhor and two other participants at a news
conference underscored the importance of parents having ready
access to day care center activity and making surprise visits to
see what is going on.
   ``Parents need to go the extra mile to become familiar with the
day care center they choose,'' said David S. Liederman, executive
director of the Child Welfare League of America. ``They should drop
in unannounced and if the center doesn't like it, they should
consider whether that is the kind of place they want their children
to be.''
   Liederman said he agreed with the study's findings and said day
care centers generally ``are safe places for children.''
   Sue Bredekamp, director of the National Academy of Early
Childhood Programs for the National Association for the Education
of Young Children, said the report was the ``most comprehensive,
national study of child sexual abuse in day care to date.''
   ``It is our hope that Dr. Finkelhor's findings ... will be as
widely disseminated and as influential to policy makers as were
reports of several infamous cases of abuse in the past,'' she said.
   The survey examined 270 cases of sexual abuse involving 1,639
children from 1983 to 1985 and made an in-depth study of a random
sample of 43 cases. An estimated 1.5 million children were cared
for in day care centers during that time.
   Finkelhor said there is no evidence the incidence of child abuse
in day care settings was higher during the past two years than
during the 1983-85 period surveyed.
   The study was commissioned by the National Center on Child Abuse
and Neglect, an agency of the Department of Health and Human
Services, and released in conjunction with the Children's Hospital
National Medical Center.

<HEAD>FAA to Assign Another Air Traffic Coordinator to O'Hare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has decided
to add an additional air traffic coordinator on each shift at
O'Hare International Airport, an FAA spokesman said Monday.
   The decision by William H. Pollard, director of the FAA's Great
Lakes region, was made after a U.S. House subcommittee hearing
Friday on safety problems at the airport, said spokesman Mort
Edelstein.
   Beginning in the near future, Edelstein said, the FAA will
assign two full-time air traffic coordinators both day and night at
O'Hare. Until now, only one full-time coordinator has been in the
O'Hare tower per shift, he said.
   The coordinators help improve the performance of the tower's air
traffic controllers.
   One of those who addressed the subcommittee hearing was James
Burnett, head of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
warned of what he called ``a disturbing number of near-collisions''
at the busy Chicago airport.
   The five-member subcommittee hearing was held at the request of
Rep. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill.
   Edelstein said he did not know the exact date when the
additional coordinators would be assigned to O'Hare.

<HEAD>Robertson Forces Will Dominate At Nevada State GOP Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDAN RILEY</BYLINE>

   Supporters of former television evangelist
Pat Robertson will apparently control the state GOP convention in
Reno next month as a result of weekend county conventions, party
officials said.
   Nevada Republicans use a three-step system of caucuses and
conventions to pick their national convention delegates. The
process began with precinct caucuses last month, at which a straw
poll was conducted.
   In the straw poll, Vice President George Bush led with 27
percent, followed by Bob Dole with 22 percent and Robertson with 15
percent. But Robertson supporters claimed victory by saying most of
the 23 percent undecided voters in the poll actually were Robertson
supporters.
   The straw poll participants were not bound to presidential
candidates, however.
   At the county conventions, held over this past weekend,
delegates were elected to the state convention April 21-23, where
in turn national convention delegates will be elected.
   The delegate breakdown for the state convention won't be known
for several days. But the Robertson forces dominated Republican
conventions in Nevada's two biggest counties, Clark and Washoe.
Party leaders said it appeared Robertson got more than half the 800
state delegates in those two counties alone.
   Robertson also picked up some delegates at the GOP's county
conventions elsewhere in Nevada, although his supporters showed
less strength in the outlying areas, party officials said.
   State GOP Chairwoman Sally Vitkus-McKinney said Monday that
party newcomers _ which most Robertson backers are _ are welcome.
But she added there is frustration because Nevada probably will
wind up with its 20-member delegation to the national convention
committed to somone who won't be the presidential nominee.
   Robertson's state director, Steve Wark, said there's no way he
would encourage the Robertson delegates to switch to Bush at the
state convention level, even though their candidate is clearly far
behind.
   ``Robertson supporters are not about to roll over. They're
making a statement and sticking to their commitment,'' he said.
However, he said Robertson supporters would be prepared to support
Bush at the national Republican convention.
   Robertson, after big losses on Super Tuesday, indicated he
intends to remain in the race, but has virtually given up hope of
getting the nomination. He has talked more at recent appearances
about his role at the convention, his long-term influence on the
party and a possible bid in 1992.

<HEAD>Government Rings Up Deficit, But Smaller So Far Than Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government ran up a $23.9 billion
budget deficit in February, but the red ink is still running
slightly behind last year's total, the Treasury Department reports.
   The deficit in February came after a rare surplus of $16.1
billion in January which had occurred because the Social Security
benefits for that month were mailed early and counted in the
December spending figures.
   For the first five months of the budget year, the government has
run up a deficit of $89.7 billion, 4.9 percent lower than the red
ink incurred in the same period a year ago.
   The Reagan administration is projecting a deficit of $146.7
billion for the entire fiscal year, a drop of 2.4 percent from the
$150.4 billion deficit in the 1987 budget year.
   But this projection is lower than estimates by the Congressional
Budget Office and many private forecasters who contend the
administration is being too optimistic about the economic outlook.
   CBO is forecasting a $157 billion deficit, and some private
economists are estimating an even higher $170 billion deficit for
the budget year that ends on Sept. 30.
   The deficit in 1987 dipped from a record $221.2 billion
shortfall in 1986 because of an unexpected windfall in tax revenues
caused by changes in the new tax law.
   Some analysts think there could be a second, smaller windfall
this year if people end up owing more on their taxes under the new
tax law than they did under the old law, something which will not
be known until after the April 15 tax filing deadline is passed.
   ``We may have another April surprise which could add an
additional $10 billion to revenue for the year,'' said Michael
Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm.
   Evans said if the windfall does materialize, the deficit could
decline to around $160 billion, but that would still be above the
Reagan administration's estimate.
   In February, government revenue totaled $60.4 billion while
government spending totaled $84.3 billion. For the first five
months of the year, revenues total $347 billion while the
government spent $436.7 billion.
   The largest spending categories in February, as usual, were the
military followed by Social Security and interest on the national
debt.
   Military spending totaled $23.1 billion last month and $116.6
billion for the fiscal year so far, up 5.3 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled $17.9 billion last month
and $86.6 billion for the past five months, up 5.1 percent from the
same period in the 1987 fiscal year.
   The other programs in the Department of Health and Human
Services, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent $12.9 billion in
February and $63.4 billion so far this budget year, a 2.3 percent
increase over 1987.
   Interest on the $2.5 trillion national debt totaled $15 billion
last month and $90.8 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase
of 9.8 percent over the same period last year, the fastest increase
of any of the major categories.
   For the entire 1988 budget year, interest on the national debt
is projected to total $210 billion, amounting to one-fifth of total
government spending.

<HEAD>Smaller Crop, Higher Demand Mean That Ain't Hay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hay prices nationally have been averaging
around 12 percent higher than a year ago, reflecting a smaller 1987
crop and some increase in demand.
   The Agriculture Department in January revised 1987 hay output
downward to 149.1 million tons from last October's preliminary
forecast of 153.7 million tons.
   A new report by the department's Economic Research Service says
that the U.S. hay area turned out to be about 500,000 acres larger
than estimated in October but that the yield was reduced by 4
percent to 2.46 tons per acre.
   The 1987 hay crop was 6.4 million tons smaller than the record
of 155.5 million tons produced in 1986.
   ``Alfalfa and alfalfa mixture hay production turned out to be
84.6 million tons, down 7 million tons from 1986, and all other hay
production of 64.6 million tons was 600,000 tons above the previous
year's 64 million,'' the report said.
   Acording to USDA production figures for 1987, California was the
leading all-hay state with more than 9 million tons, followed by:
Wisconsin, 8.88 million; Minnesota, 7.8 million; South Dakota, 7.09
million; and Iowa, 6.93 million.
   Last May 1 at the start of the 1987-88 hay crop season, the
inventory on hand was estimated at 32.4 million tons, the most
since 1980. Adding the 1987 crop, that made a total hay supply of
181.5 million tons for the marketing year that runs through April
30, slightly less than the 1986-87 suppply of 182.2 million tons.
   The hay stockpile on Dec. 1 was reported at 119.7 million tons,
meaning that 61.8 million tons had been consumed during the seven
months since May 1. In the same period a year earlier, hay
consumption was 60.5 million tons, the report said.
   Hay prices paid by farmers and ranchers averaged $64.60 per ton
during the May-November period, up $4.74 per ton from a year
earlier. In December and January of this year, prices averaged
$63.75 per ton, up $7.65 from a year earlier.
   According to USDA estimates, the value of hay production in
1987, based on market prices, was more than $9.1 billion, ranking
the crop third among all U.S. farm commodities. Only corn at $12.2
billion and soybeans, $10.4 billion, were valued higher.
   Those value estimates, incidentally, are not sales receipts or
marketings. The USDA estimates are based upon total farm values,
whether a commodity is sold or used by the producer.

   The Agriculture Department has sold Mexico
30,000 metric tons of surplus non-fat dry milk for $1,260 per ton,
about a third less than it cost American taxpayers.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said Monday the
surplus powdered milk was sold by the department's Commodity Credit
Corp. to CONASUPO, the Mexican government's food purchasing
authority.
   Goldberg said the sale ``reflects the world market price for
non-fat dry milk at the time the sale was negotiated'' with Mexico.
Deliveries are scheduled through March 1989. In addition, the CCC
provided Mexico with a three-year credit arrangement at commercial
rates of interest, he said.
   According to a recent CCC report, about 454 million pounds of
non-fat dry milk were held in storage, with a value of more than
$385 million, or about 85 cents per pound. There are approximately
2,205 pounds in a metric ton, which translates to a U.S. value of
$1,874 per ton.
   The surplus was acquired by CCC through purchases of cheese,
butter and non-fat dry milk to support the price of milk paid to
dairy farmers.
   Congress in 1985 farm law mandated the export sale of 150,000
tons of dairy products annually for the three fiscal years ending
Sept. 30, 1988. The latest deal with Mexico boosted sales this year
to 77,520 tons, Goldberg said.

   Exporters have sold China an additional
200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said.
   The sale, equal to 7.34 million bushels, was handled by
Continental Grain Co. and will be shipped in the 1988-89 wheat
marketing year that will begin on June 1.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Monday the sales were part of an
authorized 1.2 million tons of wheat announced Feb. 5 under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $2.67
per bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $20 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   China bought more than 4 million tons of wheat under previous
EEP arrangements, which allow exporters to sell commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonus averaged $24.45 per ton, or about 67 cents
per bushel of wheat. The bonuses will be paid in the form of
surplus commodities owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   China has 260,000 tons remaining for use under the EEP
initiative announced on Feb. 5, he said.

<HEAD>Senate Clears Way For Uranium Agreement With Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has removed a roadblock to a
30-year nuclear cooperation pact with Japan, rejecting claims by
opponents that the new agreement could add to the proliferation of
nuclear weapons.
   The Senate voted 53-50 Monday evening to reject a resolution to
disapprove the agreement, which provides for the sale of U.S.
uranium and uranium enrichment equipment to Japan over the next 30
years.
   It replaces a more restrictive cooperation arrangement which was
to expire at the end of the century.
   As the matter stands, the agreement will take effect at the end
of April, 90 legislative days after it was submitted to Congress.
   Under the rules governing consideration of the agreement, it
could be rejected only if both the House and Senate passed
resolutions of disapproval and the president signed them.
   The most controversial element of the new agreement is a
provision giving Japan advance consent for 30 years to reprocess
U.S.-controlled spent nuclear fuel and to use plutonium separated
from that fuel without the case-by-case approval required by the
present agreement.
   Plutonium is the key ingredient in the production of nuclear
weapons.
   Since the process involves shipment of the nuclear material to
reprocessing plants in France, opponents of the agreement contended
it will loosen U.S. control on the movement of plutonium, open
opportunities for terrorists and potentially lead to the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
   Responding to these and other concerns, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee voted 15-3 at the end of last year to recommend
that the agreement be renegotiated.
   The Reagan administration and supporters of the agreement on the
Senate floor said that permitting it to take effect would continue
U.S. influence over the Japanese nuclear program while providing
the United States with a major long-term sales market.
   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign
Relations panel, echoed many other senators in contending the
agreement does not meet the non-proliferation standards of the
Atomic Energy Act.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the agreement does not meet legal
requirements and gives no assurance of effective non-proliferation
safeguards.
   Glenn said the present law works well and that its case-by-case
approval arrangements should not be scrapped.
   But some supporters of the agreement said opponents were
motivated less by a genuine concern over nuclear proliferation than
by anger at Japanese trading practices.
   ``There is a certain amount of emotional Japan bashing going on
around here,'' said Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho.
   Contending that rejecting the agreement would hurt the United
States _ which would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in
uranium sales _ and not Japan, McClure added: ``Actually it's U.S.
bashing we're engaged in here. Rejecting this agreement will hurt
us and not the Japanese.''

<HEAD>American Family Rallies Around Welshman Who Claims GI Was His
Father</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Old loves and old photographs gave a sentimental
air to the deportation hearing of a Welshman who says he should be
allowed to stay in this country because he is the illegitimate son
of an American soldier.
   The claims of Roger Hobbs, 43, were supported Monday in federal
Immigration Court by the kin of the late Floyd Alexander of Cundy's
Harbor, Maine.
   Alexander, who died in 1970, was an American soldier stationed
in England during World War II.
   Hobbs, a janitor, insists he is the product of a union between
Alexander and Sara Hobbs, of Cardiff, Wales.
   No one has found any legal documents to prove the relationship,
but Alexander's kin say that for many years he talked openly about
his son ``Buddy'' overseas.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service contends Hobbs hasn't
proved Alexander was his father. It has also said Hobbs has a
criminal record, including attempting to steal a radiator from an
abandoned railway car.
   After Alexander returned from the war, he fathered seven
children in this country and married three different women. About a
dozen members of the Alexander clan came from Maine to stand by the
man they believe is one of them.
   Hobbs also was accompanied by his wife, Anne, 37, and sons,
Richard, 17, Ian, 15, and Wayne, 12. As British citizens, they can
apply for U.S. citizenship if Hobbs wins his case, which is built
on memories, family photos, birth and death certificates and
letters.
   Alexander's first wife, Elsie Van Buren, 60, of Lisbon Falls,
Maine, told Immigration Judge Billino D'Ambrosio that Alexander
wished he could bring Sara Hobbs and her son to this country but
never had the money.
   ``As soon as he met me he told me all about it,'' said Mrs. Van
Buren. ``He told me he lived with her _ and I know he was in love
with her _ and he had a son by her.''
   She said Alexander's mother, Allegra, often wrote to Mrs. Hobbs
and sent clothing and gifts.
   During the hearing, Hobbs sat with head bent at the back of the
small courtroom. He wiped an occasional tear from his eyes. His
burgundy corduroy jacket was emblazoned with the name of his
adopted hometome, Richmond, Maine, and a large American flag patch
was sewn over his heart.
   Mrs. Van Buren said her first husband once told her he signed a
sworn statement that Roger Hobbs was his son. The document hasn't
been found. But she said the documentation of Alexander's blood is
in the face of Roger Hobbs.
   ``I swear by my life on it. (Roger) looked more like my husband
than my children,'' Mrs. Van Buren said.
   Hobbs said he first learned of his relationship with Alexander
in 1968 from his mother, who died 11 years later.
   In October 1984, Hobbs came to this country on a tourist visa
with his family. Their visas expired in 1985 and Hobbs has asserted
his right to citizenship since.
   In 1986, federal rules were changed to give citizenship rights
to foreign children fathered by American men outside marriage.
   Hobbs' family can stay here until the case is settled. A hearing
was continued to July 7.

   Mike Nigro said he was changing
the oil on his truck when he first heard someone coming down the
street singing ``O Sole Mio.'' It was his mailman, Dennis Jordan.
   ``I thought the truck had fallen on me and the angels were
singing to me,'' Nigro said.
   Jordan, a full-time postal worker and a part-time tenor, has
brought music to the ears of his customers along his mail route.
   The 29-year-old letter carrier warms up his voice while on his
route with some easy stuff such as Neapolitan folk songs. He breaks
into arias from ``The Barber of Seville'' after a good lunch.
   ``When I'm in the mood, I'll sing my lungs out,'' he said.
   Jordan has taken formal voice lessons for 12 years and performed
with Project Opera in Northampton and other local groups.
   ``I don't usually sing opera while I'm working,'' he said
recently. ``I'm afraid of using the wrong pitch.''

   Alsop, 41, says he will use the portable phone to keep in touch

Boston to draw attention to Massachusetts' water resources.
   ``I think it's wonderful that in the midst of one of the most

schoolchildren and others gathered at the launch site Monday.
   The 33-day trip, sponsored by the Massachusetts Audubon Society,
includes a planned stop at Walden Pond near Concord, where the
famed 19th century writer Henry David Thoreau lived in an isolated
cabin for more than two years.

   Comedian Bob Hope is in excellent condition
after undergoing surgery for what was described as a benign
condition of his prostate, his publicist says.
   The 84-year-old comedian does not have cancer, spokesman Jim
Mahoney said after the surgery Monday.
   Hope was operated on at the University of Southern California
Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital and is expected to be released
late this week, said Mahoney.
   Hospital spokesman Gordon Cohen said Hope's surgeon, Dr. Donald
G. Skinner, described the comedian's condition after surgery as
excellent.
   Mahoney said the operation, common for older men, was similar to
a procedure performed on President Reagan early last year to remove
fibrous tissue filling the prostate.

   President Reagan presented White House Chief
of Staff Howard Baker with a new presidential Medal of Freedom to
replace the one missing from Baker's home after a weekend break-in.
   Baker ``is probably the only person who has received two Medals
of Freedom,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.
   Baker and his wife, Joy, were sitting in their living room
Saturday evening when an alarm sounded. Baker went downstairs to
his study to fix what he thought would be an alarm sensor fallen
from a window pane.
   Instead, he discovered a burglar stealing expensive camera
equipment and the former Tennessee senator's Medal of Freedom.
   Baker chased the thief upstairs, downstairs and out while his
wife phoned police and White House security. The burglar dropped
most of the items while being chased through the house and fled
into the street.
   Police arrested a man later that evening who had some of the
Bakers' camera equipment but not the medal. The man has refused to
identify himself to police.

   The reporters were played by actors, and when real reporters

   Flanders, who earlier this season left his role as Dr. Donald

USA Today reported Monday, he talked about death.
   ``He spoiled the moment for everybody,'' producer Tom Fontana

   Jackson paid $28 million for a 2,700-acre ranch, which he plans

   It also was reported that Jackson purchased the nearby Grand

   However, owner William Healy said Monday he has not talked with
the singer or his agent about the hotel.
   ``It's a rumor,'' he said. ``There's absolutely no truth to it.''
   The ranch Jackson agreed to purchase is in the scenic Santa Ynez

ranch owned by President Reagan and his wife, Nancy.

   Married virgins, celebrity children and American
women who marry Saudis aren't listed in the Yellow Pages. So where
do TV talk show hosts Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo
Rivera find those people, anyway?
   ``Viewer mail is one way we get ideas for guests,'' Lorri Antosz
Benson, chief producer for ``Donahue,'' said Monday.
   ``To get the off-beat people that you want, you have to rely on
the mails, because there are people out there who write in willing
to tell you all about themselves,'' Ms. Benson said in a telephone
interview from New York.
   The ``Oprah Winfrey'' show looks for entire audiences that fit a
theme of the Chicago-based show.
   Its ad on daytime television last week asked, ``If you live with
a slob, have ever lived with a slob or your parents were slobs,
please contact the Oprah Winfrey show.''
   ``We get 200 names and call back those with the best stories,''
said Alice McGee, Winfrey's publicist. ``We did a show on twins and
we had an audience full of twins.''
   The ``Geraldo'' show syndicated from New York since September
recently asked for ideas from various sources.
   ``I sent him 10 ideas on who I'd like to see on the show and
topics I wanted to see done,'' said Joanie Stat, Chicago publicist
for Rivera's syndicated specials.
   Talk shows also use many other methods. Usually producers spot
something in a newspaper or on television, then spend hours
tracking down the right guests.
   ``We have extensive files: every magazine published, newspapers
from the top 15 or 20 markets. We're always clipping things,'' Miss
McGee said. ``Sometimes the author or guest themselves suggest
other people to have on the show.''
   With Donahue, Ms. Benson said, ``Mostly it's word of mouth. You
talk to people who give you names of other people, or you ask the
audience if they know of anybody.''
   Finding the right guests for a show often has been tough
detective work.
   ``We did a show on women who marry Saudis, and go over there and
find life is not so good,'' Ms. Benson said.
   ``We got that from the mails, but then it gets more difficult.
We started talking to people, calling embassies. Then I ran across
a book about this subject, and the author had names of people, and
they knew people.''

<HEAD>Key Government Agent Orange Study Flawed, New Air Force Review
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Air Force report says an often-cited
1984 government study that was supposed to be ``reassuring'' for
Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange was flawed.
   The revised study said while the chemical defoliant could not be
``confidently identified'' as the reason for a series of health
problems among veterans who handled the chemical, it could not be
``exonerated'' either.
   The report, released Monday by Sens. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., and
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., was hailed by veteran activists as a major
breakthrough.
   ``For the first time the Air Force is saying in a major way that
they cannot rule out dioxin as the cause of ill-health effects,''
said Barry Kasinitz, spokesman for Vietnam Veterans of America.
   Air Force officials said they have never categorically ruled out
a link between Agent Orange and health problems.
   But critics say the 1984 study gave that impression when it
said, ``In the full context, the baseline study results should be
viewed as reassuring to the Ranch Handers and their families at
this time.''
   ``What they're doing is trying to reverse themselves without
really saying so,'' said Eric Hamburg, an aide to Kerry.
   Laura Petrou, a Daschle aide, said, ``We have gotten a clear
sense that the Air Force wants to work with us to get the truth
out.''
   The Air Force rejected the senators' contention that the 1984
Ranch Hand study was ``seriously'' flawed.
   ``I think that's an overstatement,'' said Dr. William Wolfe,
chief of epidemiology at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace
Medicine at Brooks Air Force Base in Texas and the senior
investigator in the Agent Orange probe.
   ``There are areas of that report that we have less confidence in
the conclusions,'' Wolfe said. But he said the bulk of the 1984
findings were upheld by the review.
   The key problem with the original study, Wolfe said, was
assumptions about exposure that failed to take work habits into
consideration. Government scientists now realize that certain
workers were sloppier than others in handling Agent Orange, and
therefore had a greater exposure that was not taken into account,
he said.
   The studies are part of the government's 20-year investigation
of Agent Orange and its impact on soldiers who handled the
defoliant. Operation Ranch Hand was the Air Force's code name for
the aerial spraying.
   Last year, a Veterans Administration study found increased
deaths due to lung cancer and certain lymph cancers among Vietnam
veteran Marines, providing what veterans' groups called the first
clear scientific data implicating Agent Orange.
   Kerry and Daschle also said the 1984 study incorrectly concluded
that all birth defects were limited to the skin.
   And the senators said the revised study indicated that the 1984
study erred by saying the only type of cancer found among the Agent
Orange veterans was skin cancer.
   Wolfe defended the original conclusion, saying, ``There is an
increase in the skin cancer in the exposed group, but not in more
serious forms of cancers.''
   Since the 1984 study, scientists have discovered a way to detect
dioxin levels in blood even years after exposure. Blood samples
have been taken from 2,010 veterans who worked with Agent Orange
and that analysis should be ready within two years, Wolfe said.
   Kerry and Daschle, both Vietnam War veterans, are pushing
legislation to compensate veterans who suffer from certain
conditions that may be tied to Agent Orange exposure.

<HEAD>ACLU Welcomes Rehearing Of Case on Court-Ordered Caesarean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is hailing
a federal appeals court's decision to rehear the case of a
terminally ill woman who underwent a court-ordered Caesarean
section against her wishes and those of her doctors.
   ACLU attorney Lynn Paltrow said Monday the decision by the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia to grant a rehearing is
significant because it vacates a ruling that allowed the
``sacrifice of a pregnant woman's life in the name of so-called
fetal life.''
   The eight-member court, acting on a petition from the ACLU,
agreed that the full court would rule on a case previously decided
upon by a three-judge panel of the appeals court.
   The three appellate judges had refused to block a Superior Court
order that the woman undergo a Caesarean section. The order was
issued after George Washington University Hospital sought a
Superior Court ruling ``as to what it should do in terms of the
fetus, whether to intervene (by Caesarean section) and save its
life.''
   The three-judge appeals panel based its decision not to block
the lower court's ruling on the belief that the woman's death was
imminent and that the child had a better chance of surviving if
delivered before her death.
   The 27-year-old woman, a leukemia patient identified as Angela
C., gave birth in June to a baby girl who died shortly after the
Ceasarean operation at the university hospital. The mother died two
days later.
   The full appeals court, in a ruling issued Thursday and made
public Monday, agreed to rehear the case and ordered the submission
of briefs by March 28.
   The ACLU said the three-judge panel's ruling needed rehearing
because the panel ``made a number of grave mistakes'' and raised
the question of ``may a court order a person to submit to
potentially life-extinguishing surgery for the benefit of another
person, much less for a fetus whose chances of survival are slim.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the latest auction, with rates on three-months
bills climbing to the highest level since late January.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 5.76 percent, up from 5.65
percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.96 percent, up from 5.78 percent
last week.
   The rates on three-month bills were the highest since Jan. 28,
when they averaged 5.85 percent. The rates on six-month bills were
the highest since they sold for 6.03 percent on Feb. 16.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 5.93 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,854.40 and 6.23 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,698.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages dropped to 6.63 percent last
week from 6.72 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Jury Convicts Former State Trooper In Death Of Trooper Girlfriend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL POOVEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former state trooper was found guilty
Monday of murder in the slaying of his trooper girlfriend, who was
shot three times in the head after he took out a $350,000 life
insurance policy on her.
   The Dallas County jury deliberated more than three hours before
finding Joe Duncan Jr. guilty on the charges of capital murder for
financial gain and capital murder of a law officer.
   Elizabeth Cobb, 31, had been a trooper less than seven months
when she failed to respond to radio calls while on night patrol
Oct. 11, 1987. The next day, investigators found her body in her
patrol car behind a rural church.
   Duncan, who had said that he and Miss Cobb had discussed
marriage, held his chin with both hands as the verdict was
announced, while his family, seated two rows behind him, began to
cry.
   Circuit Judge J.C. Norton denied a defense motion to delay the
sentencing phase of the trial, which will begin Tuesday. The jury
can recommend either life in prison without parole for Duncan, 33,
or death in the state's electric chair. The final decision between
those two options will be up to the judge.
   Duncan initially told investigators that he did not know Miss
Cobb's whereabouts the night of her disappearance.
   Several days later, he changed his story, saying that he was
scheduled to meet her at the church the night she was killed but
that when he arrived she was dead. He was then arrested and charged
with murder.
   During closing arguments earlier Monday, defense attorney Henry
Pitts said Duncan was guilty only of poor judgment for failing to
report her death and not telling investigators that he had seen her
body the night she died. Duncan had told authorities he had been
afraid to report her death after finding the body.
   Insurance agents testified that Duncan and Miss Cobb each
purchased $350,000 life insurance policies that named each other as
beneficiaries.
   Dallas County District Attorney Jim Sullivan told the jurors
that Duncan was deeply in debt and plotted to collect from Miss
Cobb's insurance policy.
   But Pitts said investigators failed to fully examine possible
links between the slaying and the arrest in Florida of a man
driving a vehicle similar to a car spotted in the area where Miss
Cobb's body was found.

   Here is the text of the State Department
reaction Monday night to Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega's offer to resign before that country's 1989 presidential
elections.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We believe the offer is little more than one, a ploy to attempt
to legitimize the illegal Solis Palma regime by calling for
negotiations between it and opposition groups and two, an effort on
the part of Noriega to maintain direct or indirect control of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Noriega is the problem, and his preoccupation with remaining on
the scene despite overwhelming domestic opposition will only ensure
continued economic and political instability there. We stand by our
previous view that Noriega should go, and the sooner the better for
Panama.

<HEAD>South Texas Nuclear Plant Receives Full-Power License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first reactor at the South Texas Nuclear
Project will be allowed to operate at full power despite
last-minute efforts by opponents to halt it because of alleged
dangerous flaws.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 5-0 Monday to approve a
full-power operating license for the reactor, part of a $5.5
billion, twin-reactor, 2,500-megawatt generating station 10 miles
from the Gulf Coast near Bay City, Texas.
   A group headed by Citizens Concerned About Nuclear Power of San
Antonio sued in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans on Friday to stop the license and was rebuffed by the
judges without comment on Monday.
   The Government Accountability Project, based in Washington, had
petitioned the NRC staff to delay Monday's vote pending a fuller
investigation of 700 allegations of intimidation, other wrongdoing
or shoddy construction. But that was rejected late Friday.
   Billie Garde, a lawyer for the GAP, said after Monday's vote,
``To handle it this way was very insulting to several dozen people
who have come to the commission. ... They're not anti-nuclear
activists.''
   The commission acted after a staff briefing on an investigation
of some of the concerns brought to the commission's attention by
the GAP, which tries to encourage and protect people who disclose
wrongdoing.
   ``It is the staff's judgment that South Texas can be operated
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public,'' Jose
Calvo, director of an NRC special team that investigated the
allegations, told the commission in repeating the conclusions of
the team report issued a week ago on the 213 allegations judged to
be safety-related.
   GAP presented two previously unidentified whistleblowers at a
morning news conference criticizing last week's special team report.
   One of them, engineer Ashok Garg, who left the project in
September 1986, said he provided the team a reference to a plant
document from April 1986, which said among other things that 20
percent of valves for plant instruments had been installed
backwards.
   Calvo, however, said in an interview after the commission
meeting: ``We reviewed that document, and we interviewed him, but
he couldn't remember details. With those instrument valves, it
doesn't make any difference if they are installed frontwards or
backwards.''
   Houston Lighting & Power Co., the project manager, has about a
48 percent share, Central Power and Light Co. of Corpus Christi has
slightly more than 25 percent, the city of Austin has about 16
percent and the city of San Antonio has about 10 percent. Austin at
one point sued Houston Lighting, charging mismanagement, but those
two parties are close to an agreement under which Houston Lighting
would take over Austin's ownership.
   A construction permit was issued in 1975. The total cost to the
four owners will be some 500 percent above initial estimates. The
second unit is more than 80 percent complete.

   Strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
has offered to resign before next year's presidential elections if
opponents agree to talks with his regime, Panama's chief of state
told his countrymen Monday.
   The opposition, whose general strike Monday paralyzed the
nation, and the United States, which has kept up steady pressure to
force a Noriega resignation, immediately rejected the general's
offer.
   Elections are scheduled for May 1989.
   ``There will be no dialogue,'' said Aurelio Barria, the main
leader of the National Civic Crusade, an anti-Noriega coalition of
200 business, professional, labor and political groups that called
the indefinite work stoppage.
   He added: ``The general has to go _ immediately, not eventually.
The strike will continue.''
   Manuel Solis Palma, installed last month as the minister in
charge of the presidency, made the announcement of Noriega's offer
in a nationally broadcast speech.
   He said Noriega had given his word ``as an officer and a
gentleman'' to step down if his conditions are met.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Anita Stockman said:
   ``We believe the offer is little more than one, a ploy to
attempt to legitimize the illegal Solis Palma regime by calling for
negotiations between it and opposition groups and two, an effort on
the part of Noriega to maintain direct or indirect control of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   ``We stand by our previous view that Noriega should go, and the
sooner the better for Panama.''
   Noriega is under indictment on federal drug charges in Florida.
The United States has dried up the flow of money to Panama, which
uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, in the effort to force him
out, and the economy is near collapse.
   The general put down a coup attempt by dissident officers last
week and rejected a U.S. plan for him to leave Panama and live in
Spain.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
earlier Monday that there were no plans for further talks with
Noriega after the return of two administration officials from
Panama City.
   ``I think they have a pretty good reading of the general's
attitude,'' Fitzwater said. ``It didn't seem to include further
conversations, at least at this point.''
   The strike included Panama City's central commercial district,
where the small shops that cater to the lower and middle classes
had not joined previous shutdowns by wealthier businesmen and
industrialists.
   ``We're sending Noriega a message,'' said the owner of a shoe
store, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. ``We
hope he's listening.''
   Noriega commands the military and police as head of the
15,000-member Defense Forces and is the power behind the civilian
government.
   The secretary of the Panamanian Human Rights Foundation said a
man died Monday of wounds suffered when he was hit in the face and
chest by birdshot fired by police during disturbances in Panama
City last Wednesday. It was the fourth protest-related death since
anti-government demonstrations began last summer.
   Noriega's opponents hailed the strike as their greatest triumph
so far.
   ``It's completely successful,'' said Guillermo Cochez, vice
president of the Christian Democratic Party. ``Today has been a
very special day ... in the capital as well as the provinces. We
hope Noriega's advisers and the people surrounding him will help
him to see the reality.''
   ``The paralyzation is total in industry, finance and commerce,''
said Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, a business leader.
   Gonzalez and Cochez are directors, along with Barria, of the
National Civic Crusade.
   Noriega made another move Monday to strengthen his control of
the Defense Forces by announcing the promotions of 98 officers to
ranks ranging from colonel to lieutenant.
   Among those promoted to colonel was Eros Ramiro Cal, who was
named last week to replace Col. Leonidas Macias, the leader of the
foiled coup, as the nation's police chief.
   The Defense Forces also said administrative discipline would be
taken against 17 officers implicated in last Wednesday's attempted
coup, but did not give details. It previously acknowledged eight or
nine officers had joined in the attempt and said only five were
being detained.
   Gustavo Gonzalez of the striking dockworkers said leaders of all
major unions were summoned to a meeting Sunday night with Solis
Palma, and told the military would not interfere if the strike
remained peaceful.
   He said union leaders were told the government, which could not
meet its payroll two weeks ago, also would be unable to cover
semi-monthly paychecks due next week.
   Solis Palma replaced Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was dismissed by
the legislature after he tried to fire Noriega and still is
recognized by the United States as Panama's president. Delvalle is
in hiding in Panama.
   Because the government has silenced opposition newspapers and
broadcast stations, thousands of people went to work without
knowing a strike had been called. Most went home when they found
stores and offices closed.
   By midday, the city was a ghost town patrolled by helmeted
soldiers in combat gear. The government said they were providing
security for businesses that chose to open.
   Panama's ailing economy came apart after Feb. 25, when Delvalle
tried to fire Noriega and the legislature fired Delvalle.
   Banks closed the following week and the government could not
meet a $33 million payroll for 130,000 public employees.
   Washington has cut off economic and military aid and millions of
dollars in Panamanian funds have been frozen in U.S. banks by legal
actions.

   Horrifying television film of IRA funeral mourners
beating up two British soldiers who were then killed has brought
demands to restrict coverage of such scenes.
   Some lawmakers urged restrictions on funeral coverage or
interviews with leaders of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of
the outlawed Irish Republican Army. They argue that the cameras'
presence encourages rioting and boosts ``terrorist organizations.''
   ``We're fighting what is in the nature of a war here,'' said
Ivor Stanbrook, senior legislator of the governing Conservative
Party, in urging a ban on interviews with Sinn Fein leaders.
   ``We wouldn't have dreamed during the war of giving currency to
Nazis so I don't see why we should give any credence ... to people
acting as the IRA's propagandists.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has criticized British TV
networks for giving the IRA what she calls the ``oxygen of
publicity.''
   But the Home Office said Monday there were no plans to impose
bans on covering IRA-related news events.
   ``When it comes to covering a demonstration in Britain or a riot
or anything, we can't start saying you go there or you don't go
there or we wouldn't have a free press,'' said spokesman Ian Scott.
   Conservative lawmaker Michael Mates said the publicly funded
British Broadcasting Corp. and commercial Independent Television
News should exercise self-restraint.
   ``I think you have to look very carefully at the question of
whether you would be getting 10,000 people coming to these funerals
if it wasn't for the fact that they are whipped up out there,''
Mates said in a radio interview.
   ``They are paraded by the IRA and Sinn Fein for the TV cameras
so that the world can see that their heroes are being buried with
the total support of the whole population ... they're made to go
along because it's got to be a spectacle.''
   Cameras filmed the initial attack Saturday on the soldiers' car
in Belfast, but were chased off by mourners before the beating
began in earnest, and they did not film the shooting of the men a
few minutes later.
   British newspapers, however, published pictures of the
near-naked bodies the next day.
   ``It was a shocking, brutal event and I was as horrified as
anyone to see things like that on my television screen,'' said
Michael Grade, head of commercial Channel 4.
   ``But you cannot sanitize a story ... The BBC and ITN made
people understand the horror of the situation,'' he told Today
newspaper.
   ``We take great care in what we show,'' said ITN spokeswoman
Geraldine Sharp-Newton. But ``by not showing it we'll not make it
go away.''
   Still, there are inconsistencies. British networks often preface
violent scenes with a warning to viewers, but none preceded the
Belfast footage.
   In the Irish Republic, the state media cannot broadcast
interviews with officials of Sinn Fein, on the grounds that they
speak for an outlawed organization, the IRA.
   South Africa has imposed stringent curbs on reporting in what
are defined as ``unrest areas.'' Offenders face prison, fines or
expulsion.
   The South Africans say violent incidents dropped by 35 percent
immediately after the restrictions were decreed in June 1986.
   International criticism of Israel's handling of Palestinian
unrest has prompted charges that foreign networks distort the
country's image and inflame unrest.
   President Chaim Herzog asked this month whether Israeli
democracy should ``allow this weapon to be turned against my
children and my country.''
   Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. secretary of state, and Mayor
Ed Koch of New York have suggested that Israel ban TV crews
outright from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel has not gone that far, but on March 4 the military for
the first time banned reporters and TV crews from extensive areas
of the occupied lands. They have since renewed the ban repeatedly,
generally on a smaller scale.

   When Pope John Paul II arrived here last
fall, homosexuals took to the streets to protest the Vatican's
condemnation of their way of life.
   Roman Catholic officials believe the visit helped heal relations
between homosexuals and the church, but gay activists still recoil
in anger when speaking of John Paul.
   The pope encountered the largest and angriest demonstrations of
his nine-city tour during his 21-hour visit to San Francisco.
Outside Mission Dolores, where the pope met with AIDS victims,
2,000 protesters shouted ``pope, go home'' and ``shame, shame.''
   The Rev. Miles Riley, chief publicist for the Archdiocese of San
Francisco, contends protests were even smaller than reported and
reflected well upon the church's conciliation efforts.
   ``I think there was tremendous healing with the whole gay
community and with AIDS patients,'' Riley said. ``I think much of
the healing took place before he came.''
   The archdiocese and a coalition of gay groups met before the
pope's visit and drafted a joint statement of non-violence.
   Recently, the archdiocese announced the opening of a 40-bed
hospice for homeless AIDS patients.
   Before the pope's visit, the Vatican published a theological
letter that called homosexualtiy an ``intrinsic moral evil.'' While
declaring God's love for homosexuals, the church is opposed to
homosexual relationships.
   ``We are going to be ourselves,'' said John Wahl, an attorney
who coordinated an umbrella group of homosexuals and bisexuals to
oppose the Sept. 17-18 visit. ``We are going to relate to members
of our own sex, just as heterosexual people relate to people of the
opposite sex.
   ``Basically, so long as they insist that same-sex is sinful,
they are our adversaries,'' Wahl said.
   However, confrontations between church and homosexuals have
moved elsewhere. Members of Dignity, made up of Catholic, sexually
active gays, were arrested during demonstrations in March and
February at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.
   At one of those services, Cardinal John O'Connor said the
church's teaching against homosexual behavior would not be changed.
``We cannot alter the Gospel,'' he said.
   In January, about 250 Dignity members and supporters held a
candlelight vigil outside St. Joseph's Cathedral in Hartford, Conn.
   During his visit to Mission Dolores, John Paul blessed 62 AIDS
patients.
   One of them, 4-year-old Brendan O'Rourke, suddenly reached out
and touched the pontiff's ear. The startled but pleased pope hugged
the boy, who's believed to have contracted AIDS through a blood
transfusion.
   Riley said the boy is doing well. He said he celebrated Mass at
the boy's home recently when Brendan blurted out: ``I hugged the
pope! I hugged the pope!''

<HEAD>New Jersey Governor Endorses Bush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PLAINSBORO, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After picking up Gov. Thomas H. Kean's
backing, Vice President George Bush said he'll carry two messages
stressed by Kean _ the importance of improving education and the
need for Republicans to reach out to voters traditionally aligned
with Democrats.
   ``Tom Kean has done a remarkable job in New Jersey. And it is
reaching out to our fellow Republicans, but it is also going after
those in the Democratic column,'' Bush said.
   ``He has demonstrated that the open-door policy works. His
success is an inspiration of what we can accomplish nationally.''
   Bush made the remarks Monday at a joint appearance in which Kean
and the state's county Republican chairmen abandoned their
neutrality in the presidential race and threw their support to Bush.
   Kean decided to support Bush after the vice president won the
Illinois primary last week.
   New Jersey's county Republican chairmen, who had been waiting
for Kean to act, followed the governor's lead and voted to endorse
Bush at a breakfast meeting Monday morning.
   ``George Bush is our leader, and with the Republican vision of a
stronger America, that offers oppportunity to all regardless of
color or creed, we can not only retain the presidency, but send
(House Speaker) Jim Wright to the back benches for the rest of this
century,'' said Kean.
   After Monday's announcement, Kean left with Bush to help the
vice president campaign in Connecticut, which holds its primary
next Tuesday.
   One GOP county chairman said the endorsements almost assure Bush
will win New Jersey's 64 Republican delegates. The state's primary
is June 7.
   Bush then said he would ``shamelessly steal'' the governor's
message that Republicans must reach out to blacks, unions and
others traditionally aligned with the Democratic Party.
   Kean, who picked up minority and union support in winning
re-election by a landslide in 1985 has been touted as a possible
vice presidential candidate.

Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The disclosure that a former federal
prosecutor may have fabricated death threats against herself and a
magistrate during an extradition case has shocked her former
colleagues.
   On Monday, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that Judy
Russell allegedly cut out words from newspapers to form threatening
messages that she received in the mail during the case she was
handling against two Sikhs accused of terrorism in India.
   A search of her house turned up similar threatening messages in
a travel bag and scissors apparently used to clip newspapers and
magazines, Alito said.
   No charges were filed, but an investigation was continuing, he
said.
   Few lawyers in the U.S. attorney's office and in private
practice would speak publicly, but almost all interviewed Monday
said Ms. Russell had been a highly intelligent and hard-driven
assistant U.S. attorney.
   ``I've been sick over this thing ever since I found out about a
week and a half ago,'' said Thomas G. Roth, one of Ms. Russell's
three partners who left the U.S. attorney's office with her last
summer to form their own firm.
   After leaving, Ms. Russell was appointed a special assistant
U.S. attorney to enable her to continue with the case against the
Sikhs, Ranjit Singh Gill, 25, and Sukhminder Singh, 26.
   Singh's attorney, Ronald Kuby, called Monday's disclosures
``clearly the most astounding thing I've heard'' and said he would
seek to have all extradition proceedings against the men dropped.
   During the case, Kuby had strongly denied that any supporters of
the Sikhs were behind the threats, and had suggested the Indian
government may be involved.
   Alito said Ms. Russell's alleged responsibility for the threats
had no affect on the outcome of the extradition hearings in
February, when U.S. Magistrate Ronald J. Hedges approved
extradition. But Alito said he would seek a new hearing ``to avoid
any appearance of impropriety.''
   During the hearings, Ms. Russell did not specifically accuse the
two men of having sent the notes, but cited the death threats in
requesting added security.
   Sharpshooters lined nearby rooftops, observers passed through
two metal detectors, dozens of U.S. marshals attended and nearby
streets were closed.
   The Justice Department's Department of Public Integrity is
handling the investigation of the 36-year-old Ms. Russell, the
former deputy chief of the U.S. attorney's Criminal Division, Alito
said.
   Robert J. Fettweis, Ms. Russell's attorney and former colleague
in the U.S. attorney's office, said she was in a private hospital.
He would not comment on any aspect of the case or the nature of her
hospitalization.
   The disclosure of the investigation came during a court session
requested by Alito to ``correct and supplement'' the record
regarding the threats.
   Suspicions about the threats were raised when Ms. Russell told
FBI agents on Feb. 5 that a letter saying ``No more warning Federal
Court death for you'' was hand-delivered to the hotel where she was
under 24-hour guard.
   An FBI agent's affidavit unsealed Monday said none of the deputy
U.S. marshals guarding her saw anyone enter or leave the area
around her room.
   The 24-hour guard was ordered after Ms. Russell submitted to
Hedges during the extradition hearings sealed information about
previous alleged threats.
   One letter addressed to Ms. Russell said, ``Don't get dead.
Don't go to court.''
   The magistrate received a threatening letter two weeks before
the extradition hearings, Alito said.
   An FBI laboratory analysis showed that typewritten characters on
envelopes containing the threats matched those on Ms. Russell's
1983 application to the U.S. attorney's office, he said. The
typewriter matching the print also was found in her home.
   The Indian government charges that Singh plotted the revenge
assassination of a retired Indian general who led the bloody 1984
assault against Sikh militants occupying the Sikhs' holiest shrine,
the Golden Temple in Amritsar.
   Gill was charged in the killing of a Parliament member.

<TEXT>
   Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired national
security aide now facing criminal charges from the Iran-Contra
affair, has gone on leave in preparation for retirement from the
Marine Corps in six weeks.
   ``Lt. Col. North began his terminal leave today,'' said Lt. Col.
John Shotwell, a Marine Corps spokesman. ``He had sufficient leave
on the books to cover the period from now until his retirement on
May 1,'' added Shotwell, in Monday's announcement.
   North had been working in a staff position at Marine Corps
headquarters here since President Reagan dismissed him from the
White House staff in November 1986. He announced last Friday _ two
days after his indictment by a federal grand jury _ that he had
decided to leave the corps.
   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and
two others were indicted by a federal grand jury March 16 on
charges they conspired to divert profits from arms sales to Iran to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   By specifying a May 1 retirement date, the date on which he will
have completed 20 years on active duty, North will be eligible to
retire with a military pension equal to half his monthly base pay
of $3,693.60.

<HEAD>Senate Urges Talks With USSR To Curb `Bandit' Fishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is urging the Reagan administration
to open negotiations with the Soviet Union aimed at curbing
uncontrolled ``bandit'' fishing from international waters in the
Bering Sea.
   A 79-0 vote on Monday approved a non-binding,
sense-of-the-Senate resolution which declares that foreign fishing
fleets are using a zone located between the 200-mile fishing limits
established by the United States and the Soviet Union as ``a
staging ground for raids'' into one of the richest fishing grounds
in the world.
   According to the resolution, immediate action to protect Bering
Sea fishery resources is needed because of lack of cooperation by
other high-seas fishing nations under existing agreements.
   The resolution calls for the convening of U.S.-Soviet
negotiations to impose a moratorium on all fishing in the zone, a
ban which would stay in effect until an international fishery
management agreement is negotiated.
   Because of its location, completely surrounded by U.S. and
Soviet territorial waters, the 4,500 square mile area is known
variously as ``the hole in the doughnut'' or ``the doughnut.''

   Soft-spoken gentleman cowboy Randy
Travis won the most trophies but the Academy of Country Music voted
once again the heartland's rowdy leader of song, Hank Williams Jr.,
its favorite entertainer.
   It was the second consecutive Entertainer of the Year trophy for
the man nicknamed Bocephus, the 38-year-old son of country music
great Hank Williams.
   ``This is what my momma wanted all the time. ... She would be so
proud and, of course, my daddy, I know he'd be proud,'' Williams
said after taking the top honor Monday night at Knott's Berry Farm
   The 23rd annual awards presentation was televised nationally by
NBC.
   Travis, 28, won three awards: top male singer, song and single
of the year for his hit, ``Forever and Ever, Amen.''
   ``It's still a big thing to keep winning. It makes me quite
nervous. It doesn't feel any different than it did the first
time,'' said Travis, who last year won four awards on the strength
of the song ``On The Other Hand.''
   Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt won the album
trophy for ``Trio.'' The mother-daughter duo The Judds took the
duet trophy. Los Angeles-based Highway 101 was best group, and Reba
McEntire won top female vocalist for the fourth time.
   ``It's like they're saying `Reb, you still got it,' and that's
nice,'' Miss McEntire said.
   Ricky Van Shelton won for new male vocalist.
   K.T. Oslin was the new female vocalist and won the video honor
for ``80's Ladies.''
   ``It's better than wonderful. It's marvelous,'' Van Shelton
said. ``It means you've finally arrived. It means you're there.''
   Roger Miller received the non-competitive Pioneer Award.
   Highway 101's group award marked the second consecutive loss in
that category for perennial favorite Alabama, although Highway
member Cactus Moser didn't think the awards should be considered a
horse race.
   ``I don't feel like we beat them,'' Moser said. ``It's wonderful
to be recognized.''
   Williams and Travis faced off in Entertainer of the Year,
vocalist, single, song, album and video categories.
   ``It's a great feeling but it comes with a lot of work,''
Williams said of his victory.
   Nominees were picked by the 2,500-member Academy of Country
Music and they voted by mail-in ballot.
   Drummer Archie Francis won his 11th academy trophy and fiddler
Johnny Gimble and steel guitarist J.D. Maness each won their 10th
awards to lead winners in instrumental categories.
   Bass player Emory Gordy Jr., guitarist Chet Atkins and
keyboardist John Hobbs won their second-consecutive academy
trophies.
   David Hungate tied Gordy in the bass category, Ronnie Milsap
tied Hobbs in the keyboard category, and Ricky Skaggs, who plays
the mandolin, tied with Jerry Douglas, who plays the dobro, in the
specialty instrument category.
   The Strangers won their eighth touring band trophy and Nashville
Now won the non-touring band award.
   Jim Tabor of radio WMC in Memphis, Tenn., was selected disc
jockey of the year, his first academy win, and KNIX radio in
Phoenix, Ariz., was picked the top radio station for the second
consecutive year.
   The Crazyhorse Steakhouse & Saloon in Santa Ana, Calif., won the
nightclub of the year honor for the second consecutive year.

<DATELINE>PORTALES, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly couple that gave a job and
shelter to a homeless Chicago man have learned that you can take
Harold Thomas out of the city, but you can't take the city out of
Harold.
   ``I think he's going to be happier with his people,'' Ethel
Gilman said Monday. ``He seemed very happy here. It seemed like he
thought a lot of us. We thought a lot of him. It started out nice
and ended nice.''
   Thomas spent three months working at the junkyard owned by Mrs.
Gilman, 68, and her husband, Roy, 75.
   Thomas withdrew $300 from a Portales bank Monday and boarded an
eastbound bus.
   Thomas had planned to work at the junkyard through the summer,
but said he couldn't do it without any wages.
   ``A man can't live with just room and board,'' he said. ``After
three months with room and board, you know, I want to have a family
and stuff. Room and board just doesn't make it.
   ``I'm thinking about getting married pretty soon,'' Thomas said.
``I just want to get somewhere where I can get established and have
an income.''
   Thomas much of last year living in a rotting wood and canvas
shack on the banks of the Chicago River. The Gilmans read of his
plight in a story about the homeless in Chicago and how they were
enduring the subzero temperatures. The couple called The Associated
Press bureau in Chicago and said if Thomas were willing to work
they'd give him a job and a roof over his head.
   Thomas, 35, arrived Jan. 17 in Portales, an eastern New Mexico
farming and ranching community of about 11,000 people.
   His home here was an 8-foot-by-30-foot trailer in the junkyard
where he worked eight hours a day, six days a week, tearing apart
old cars and rebuilding the engines. The other day, he said, was
spent working in the fields at a church-run orphanage, where his
benefactors volunteered his service.
   Thomas had not been paid after a month on the job, and the
Gilmans said his room and board were his remuneration.
   Thomas' boss, the Gilmans' son Ralph, said Thomas didn't give
any notice he was quitting. He said Thomas told him Monday morning
he was homesick and was ready to go.
   ``The girl I was going with in Chicago wants to get married,''
Thomas said.
   He also said he was going to try to find a place to stay, and
see if his brother might help him.
   But he said the Gilmans were nice people and had placed $300 in
the bank for him.
   ``It seems like it's better for both of us because they say
they're going in the hole,'' Thomas said. ``They say they're going
into the hole on account of me staying there. I don't want to put a
lot of pressure on those people.''
   Before gaining national attention, Thomas wore ill-fitting
clothes and ate in soup kitchens. He and another man endured the
harsh winter in a lean-to shack rather than try to find refuge in
city-run shelters.
   By the time Thomas boarded a bus for the 1,478-mile, 27-hour
journey to New Mexico people had donated new clothes, new luggage
and spending money.
   Thomas said Monday he was leaving rather than trying to find
work in Portales because he didn't want to put pressure on people
in the community. He also said he had had offers to live in nearby
Clovis.
   Although Thomas apparently had no job waiting for him in
Chicago, he has said his days among the homeless are over.
   ``I never knew I'd end up like I did,'' Thomas told the AP in an
interview in February. ``I hope I don't end up in a slump like that
again. That ain't no kind of life for a man.''

   Mayor Edward I. Koch has accused a group of
Spanish Harlem residents of meting out ``frontier justice'' for
chasing down and fatally beating a man accused of stealing $20.
   But four suspects charged with first- and second-degree
manslaughter in the attack said they ``said they thought they had
done the right thing, chasing and capturing this guy,'' said police
Capt. William J. Quigley.
   Police said at least four others may have been part of the group
that beat 41-year-old Raymondo Carabello on Sunday after he
allegedly snatched the money from a woman at a bakery.
   Koch denounced the attackers Monday, saying they ``executed the
death penalty without a trial.''
   ``Here is a guy who, at worst, may have stolen $20,'' he said.
``No one would suggest that anybody be executed for stealing $20.
... They were meting out justice as they saw it, frontier justice.
That's not permissible in civilized society.''
   But some who live in the neighborhood expressed mixed feelings
about the attack.
   ``It's not right that he got killed,'' Felix Olmos, 23, said as
he stood at the counter of a grocery store not far from the bakery.
   ``But I understand. That stuff's got to stop. ... People will
think twice about stealing around here. It's kind of dangerous
around here.''
   The beating death occurred in front of the Jefferson Houses
public housing project in an area of East Harlem that has been
plagued by crack dealers and violence.
   After being robbed in the bakery, the woman asked a crowd on the
corner if they had seen the man who had just robbed her. Caraballo
came out of the houses and the group chased him down the block.
   ``They started to beat him, (with) fists and feet,'' Quigley
said.
   ``He was getting beaten all over, the legs, the ribs,'' said Al
Rivera, 27, who was in the area visiting a friend.
   ``He was yelling, `Please stop! No more! no more!''' Rivera said.
   ``They said, `We're going to kill you!''' said Rivera's friend
Jose Augostini. The man staggered across the street and collapsed
in front of Augostini's building.
   Police broke up the fight and Caraballo stood up and was
handcuffed, Quigley said. The officers radioed for an ambulance as
they took him to their office.
   He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital where he died Sunday
evening.
   Four hours later, Jesus Negron, 23, was arrested, police
said.Three others surrendered Monday: David Andino, 22, and Charles
Mimms, 20, and Isidore Cuadrado, 14, police said.
   Neither the suspects nor Caraballo, who lived nearby, have
previous criminal records, police said. Needle marks on his arm
suggested he was a drug addict, police said.
   Quigley said the suspects apparently did not know each other and
none of them knew Caraballo.
   The 14-year-old is being treated as an adult because of the
seriousness of the crime.
   The $20 was not recovered.

<HEAD>Dole Again Challenges Bush To Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMERY, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole, struggling on against Vice
President George Bush, said he would support whoever turns out to
be the Republican nominee. But he says it could still be him.
   ``There are a lot of people who say the Republican race is over,
we already got our nominee and let's get ready for the
convention,'' he said Monday as he campaigned here. ``And I'll say
this, when we get the nominee, I'll be working for the nominee _
but it's only the second day of spring.''
   Dole renewed his debate challenge to Bush and the acting mayor
of this farming community, Vern Peterson quickly volunteered to
have Amery serve as site for a debate. Bush has declined recent
invitations to debate with Dole, saying they have had enough
debates already.
   Dole searched for support from Democrats as well as Republicans
in Wisconsin's open primary, in which voters are not required to
state party preference.
   ``I want a big, big surprise to happen on April 5. And I think
it can happen in the state of Wisconsin,'' Dole said.

<HEAD>Dole, Robertson Camps Plan Appeal of Primary Court Challenge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says he won't upset New York
election law to place delegate slates supporting Pat Robertson or
Sen. Bob Dole on all ballots in next month's state Republican
primary.
   But supporters of the two GOP presidential hopefuls said they
would appeal Monday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand
before the April 19 primary.
   The Robertson and Dole supporters are challenging state law
which they claim made it unfairly difficult to get delegate slates
favoring their candidates on the ballot in New York.
   Candidates were required to get the signatures of 1,250
registered Republicans or 5 percent _ whichever was less _ in each
of the state's 34 congressional districts in order to get their
slates on the ballot. The signatures had to be obtained between
Jan. 5 and Feb. 11.
   But only Vice President George Bush's campaign was able to get
the necessary signatures in a majority of the 34 districts.
   ``We feel the judge has made several errors in his ruling. We
will be appealing,'' said Henry Hews of Americans for Robertson.

   Vice President George Bush is the
overwhelming favorite going into New York's April 19 primary among
likely Republican voters questioned for a recent statewide poll.
   The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion also reported in
its study released Monday that in theoretical matchups, pitting
Bush against the major Democratic candidates, the vice president is
the choice of New Yorkers except when it comes to Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis. In that possible contest, Dukakis appeared to
have a slight edge over Bush in New York.
   Of the 292 likely Republican primary voters sampled, 68 percent
said they favored Bush while 22 percent opted for Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole and 3 percent went for Pat Robertson. Less than 1 percent
picked another candidate and 6 percent said they were undecided.
   ``Bush's support is solid across the board, outpolling his
rivals among upstate, New York City and suburban Republicans,''
noted Marist pollster Lee Miringoff.
   The margin of error for the Republican portion of the poll is
plus or minus 6 percent. The poll was based on interviews conducted
for the first four days of last week.

<HEAD>California Draft Cuomo Campaign Faces Still Another Legal Hurdle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group attempting to place Mario
Cuomo's name on California's presidential primary ballot despite
the New York governor's objections faces still another legal
obstacle.
   Gerald Hill, one of two coordinators of the Draft Cuomo
committee, said Monday that while his group believes it has more
than the 22,500 signatures required statewide on its petitions, it
hasn't met the requirement of filing a minimum of 500 verified
signatures from each of California's 45 congressional districts.
   ``We have to admit we don't have all 45. There are four or five
districts where we didn't make the 500, no question of it,'' Hill
said in a telephone interview.
   ``That's another hurdle, no question of it. But matters like
this have come up numerous times in numerous states, and courts
have (overturned) overly stringent requirements ... if it's too
burdensome.
   Under the law the group is using in its attempt to place Cuomo's
name on California's ballot, the group also must have the consent
of the candidate, something Hill concedes Cuomo has not given.

<HEAD>Ohio Primary Too Late, Professor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ohio's urban problems and those of some
other northeast states, are being left behind in the presidential
primary shuffle because their primaries are held too late, an
elections researcher said.
   Linda L.M. Bennett, a political science professor at Wittenberg
University, also said Ohio should consider holding caucuses,
instead of a popular vote.
   Caucuses allow elected officials and party leaders more say, and
``they're better informed on the issues and they know what it takes
to get elected,'' she said.
   Ohio last year considered moving the May 3 primary to mid-March,
but lawmakers dropped the idea when Gov. Richard Celeste failed to
include it in his budget.
   Ms. Bennett doesn't expect Ohio's Democratic and Republican
leaders to institute major reforms, partly because they like the
long primary season for state and local candidates. She said they
more easily can influence those primaries.

<TEXT>
   Singer Linda Ronstadt called San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Herb Caen a ``creep'' for publishing the
address of her new home here, the newspaper reported today.
   Ronstadt, 41, recently bought the house for $2.55 million in the
city's ritzy Pacific Heights neighborhood. Although she hasn't
moved in, she is thinking about selling it.
   ``There's too much publicity about it, and it's not a good idea
to live there,'' said Ronstadt, who is on a national tour. ``It's
kind of a security risk.''
   According to the newspaper, after Caen published the address,
Ronstadt said it made her ``not like the house, and it made me not
like the neighborhood, and it made me not like the city, and it
made me not like to live there. That's the end of it.''
   After success as a folk-rock singer with the band Stone Poneys
in 1968, Ronstadt became one of the biggest rock stars of the '70s
with songs such as ``You're No Good,'' ``When Will I be Loved?,''
``Heat Wave,'' ``Blue Bayou,'' and ``It's So Easy.''
   Her latest album, ``Canciones de Mi Padre,'' consists of
traditional Mexican songs, which she sings in Spanish. Ronstadt was
born to parents of German and Mexican descent.

   The rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance handily defeated the governing Christian
Democrats in legislative and municipal elections this week,
election officials announced.
   The defeat presented President Jose Napoleon Duarte, the
staunchest U.S. ally in Central America, with the prospect of an
uphill climb in his final year in office. Presidential elections
are set for March 1989.
   Mario Samayoa, the president of the Central Elections Council,
told journalists ``more than 50 percent'' of the votes cast on
Sunday went to the alliance, known by its Spanish acronym of Arena.
He declined to be more specific, saying complete returns would be
ready shortly.
   The announcement Monday of a majority for Arena signaled a
triumph even greater than the rightists had predicted.
   They had 13 deputies in the outgoing 60-seat National Assembly,
which the centrist Christian Democrats controlled with 33 seats.
   Arena appeared assured of at least 31 seats in the new chamber.
The party predicted it would have 35. Local media projected 33-35
seats for the rightists. The Christian Democrats were expected to
get about 22 seats.
   Voters ignored a leftist guerrilla boycott call and threats of
violence to cast ballots. The guerrillas said the elections were
illegitimate, contending that free and fair elections could not be
held in wartime.
   Washington sent El Salvador almost $600 million in military and
economic aid last year, more than the amount given to any country
in the hemisphere.
   Arena candidate Armado Calderon Sol, a 39-year-old lawyer, won
the mayor's race in San Salvador, the capital and home to 1.5
million of the country's 5 million people. Calderon Sol defeated
Christian Democratic candidate Alejandro Duarte, the president's
son.
   Samayoa said Arena won most of the rest of the country's
municipalities.
   Arena benefited from a groundswell of popular discontent with
the Christian Democrats. Duarte won the presidency in 1984 on a
platform of ending the war and improving the Salvadoran economy.
   The 8-year-old war continues, unemployment is estimated at 40
percent and annual inflation is estimated at nearly 40 percent.
   Arena's campaign slogan was ``Change for the Better.''
   Arena President Alfredo Cristiani, who kept his assembly seat,
told The Associated Press his party would try to reach agreement on
fundamental points with all parties represented in the legislature,
including how to wage the war.
   ``If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make
them, which will be the result of a national consensus, they do not
leave any other way out but a military solution,'' he said.
   He indicated that Arena, which has considerable support and good
connections with military officers, would work to step up
offensives against the rebels.
   ``This low intensity conflict idea should be erased,'' he said,
referring to smaller-scale, U.S.-backed counterinsurgency tactics
that have been adopted by the Salvadoran army.
   In Washington, the State Department hailed El Salvador's
national elections and called them a strong victory for the
democratic process.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who led an observer team named by
President Reagan, called the election honest and important
``because power transferred peacefully'' and ``the rebels didn't
win.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, asked whether the
Reagan administration had any reservations about a rightist
victory, said that ``we don't choose sides in these kinds of
elections.''
   The fiercely nationalistic Arena was formed in 1981, with
retired army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson its founder. D'Aubuisson has
strongly criticized the United States and is considered the driving
force behind early 1980s death-squads.

   Two young brothers died after being
trapped in an abandoned freezer near their parents' home,
authorities said.
   The boys' stepfather, Larry O'Neal, found the bodies early
Monday in the freezer, which was about 100 yards from the home and
had been used as a worm bed, authorities said.
   Curtis O'Neal, 8, and his 5-year-old brother, Billy Joe, died
late Sunday or early Monday, said Pike County Coroner Dub Deal.
   Deal said the parents had last seen them flying a kite about 5
p.m. Sunday. When the boys didn't return home, the parents believed
they were spending the night with their grandparents, who live
nearby, he said.
   The boys' mother, Teresa O'Neal, discovered early Monday that
they were missing, the coroner said.
   Shirley Davis, the boys' grandmother, told authorities they may
have gotten muddy while playing in a creek and crawled into the
freezer to change clothes.

   Olivia Newton-John and the Bee Gees were
among the 100 mourners to say farewell to singer Andy Gibb, who
died of a heart ailment at age 30.
   ``As we all know, for some years Andy struggled with cocaine,''
the Rev. Stephen Stewart of St. Paul's United Methodist Church in
Tarzana told the mourners at Monday's funeral at Forest Lawn
Memorial Park.
   ``But,'' said Stewart, ``Andy beat drugs.''
   The British-born Gibb, whose brothers Barry, Maurice and Robyn
comprised the Bee Gees, died March 10 in Oxford, England.
   Gibb had a series of hit songs in the 1970s, including ``I Just
Want to Be Your Everything'' and ``Shadow Dancing.'' But his career
and a highly publicized relationship with television star Victoria
Principal ended with drug abuse. In 1985, he was treated for a
cocaine habit.
   After the private service, the casket was rolled from the chapel
with the Bee Gees walking behind. The body was then taken to the
Courts of Remembrance and placed in a wall.
   Gibb died of myocarditis, a rare viral infection of the heart
muscle, after he was hospitalized for stomach pains. Doctors said
there was no evidence that drugs or alcohol were involved in his
death.
   Shortly before his death, Gibb had begun efforts to resume his
singing and recording career.
   A statement issued at the funeral announced the establishment of
the Andy Gibb Memorial Foundation to raise money for charities
including the Diabetes Research Institute, the American Cancer
Society and the American Heart Association.

   A quasi-governmental panel has recommended that
wood-burning fireplaces be banned by 1994 to cut air pollution, but
the proposal was attacked by home builders.
   ``You can ban woodburning, but you can't ban bricks and
mortar,'' said Arlene Quenan of the Colorado Association of Home
Builders. ``You're going to have real trouble when people say, `I
want a fireplace in my new home.'''
   In its proposal Monday, the Metropolitan Air Quality Council
subcommittee said that within five years all newly installed
fireplaces should be fueled by natural gas and all existing
wood-burning fireplaces be put out of service or converted to gas.
   The council will consider the ban on April 4.
   Colorado last year became the first state to require new
wood-burning stoves to meet air-quality standards for carbon
monoxide and particulates.

<TEXT>
   Scientists have redesigned a potent
natural poison so that it seeks out and kills cancer cells in the
test tube, signaling a possible new route for fighting some tumors,
a scientist says.
   The poison, so strong that a dose the size of a salt grain can
kill a person, may be harnessed for fighting breast cancers that
have spread elsewhere in the body, and some lung and brain tumors,
according to Ira Pastan of the National Cancer Institute.
   The strategy takes advantage of the fact that some cancer cells
display on their surface certain kinds of protein structures called
receptors. Specific substances bind to each kind of receptor before
they enter the cell.
   Normal cells have receptors too, but the new work focuses on
receptors that are far more numerous on cancer cells, Pastan told
science writers at a seminar sponsored by the American Cancer
Society.
   Using genetic engineering, scientists essentially redesigned the
gene that a common bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses to
produce its potent poison, called an endotoxin. The bacteria can
cause pink eye, bacterial meningitis and pneumonia.
   One portion of the endotoxin molecule seeks out normal cells and
binds to them. Scientists deleted the portion of the gene
responsible for creating that portion and substituted another, so
that the endotoxin produced by the gene would seek out cancer cells
instead.
   Then they put the altered gene into a second kind of bacterium
and put it to work. The bacterium churned out multiple copies of
the cancer-seeking version of the poison.
   Pastan said Monday that scientists have experimented with two
types of redesigned poison, each geared to a different receptor on
cancer cells.
   One, the receptor for a hormone called interleukin-2, is found
in high concentrations on white blood cells in a disease called
adult T-cell leukemia, which is found chiefly in the Caribbean area
and Japan, Pastan said.
   The other receptor binds either of two growth-stimulating
substances, called epidermal growth factor or transforming growth
factor alpha. It is found in abundance in some lung cancer cells,
breast cancer cells and brain tumors called glioblastomas, he said.
   Glioblastomas are untreatable now, Pastan said.
   In test tube experiments, the redesigned poisons sought out and
killed cancer cells while largely ignoring normal cells, he said.
The poison works by entering a cell and sabotaging the cell's
protein-making machinery.
   Pastan said such ``oncotoxins'' represent a step beyond a
similar approach, which is attaching a poison to a protein called
an antibody that seeks out cancer cells. That has been studied for
some years, and Pastan said the antibody approach is now being
studied in four ovarian cancer patients at the cancer institute.
   Their doses are aimed at looking for side effects, and are too
low to expect any effect against their tumors, he said.
   Dick Rauscher, cancer society senior vice president for
research, called Pastan's new approach ``very promising.''
   It may one day be able to circumvent a problem with the antibody
system, that the body's immune system quickly recognizes the
antibody-poison combination as foreign and tries to destroy it, he
said.

<HEAD>Jazz Composer Gil Evans Dies At Age 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gil Evans, considered one of the most
influential postwar jazz orchestrators and composers, was
remembered by Dizzy Gillespie as a man who will be missed ``for
always keeping time with the age he's in.''
   Evans died Sunday at age 75.
   ``Whatever new thing, new ideas come up, Gil Evans was right on
top them,'' said Gillespie, who knew Evans well but did not perform
with him. ``He will be missed for having a very strong feeling for
the soloist. He was tender. One of a kind.''
   Trumpeter Miles Davis, whose musical collaboration with Evans
spanned 40 years, said, ``Whenever I had a question about the
music, composing or which way to go, I would think about what Gil
would do. I'll really miss him.''
   Davis composed a tune he titled ``Gil Evans'' two or three days
before Evans' death.
   ``He called me up once in the middle of the night,'' Davis
recalled Monday, ``and he said, `If you ever feel bad and low, just
listen to yourself on ``Miles Ahead.''' And he hung up.''
   ``Miles Ahead,'' ``Birth of the Cool,'' ``Porgy and Bess'' and
``Sketches of Spain'' were albums Evans orchestrated for Davis, who
then was playing in his ``cool'' style.
   Evans earlier had been an arranger for his own band, Skinnay
Ennis and Claude Thornhill, but became famous with Davis. He was
considered one of jazz's greatest orchestrators, along with Duke
Ellington and Todd Dameron.
   Evans also arranged a collection of jazz classics for Cannonball
Adderley and his own band's ``Out of the Cool,'' which were marvels
of harmonic subtlety and originality. Always open-minded, Evans was
planning to arrange a Jimi Hendrix album, when the rock guitarist
died in 1970. Evans wrote his first film score, for ``Absolute
Beginners,'' at age 74.
   Evans died Sunday of peritonitis in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels armed with knives, swords
and axes attacked two villages in northern Sri Lanka early today
and slashed 13 Sinhalese civilians to death, Sri Lankan military
officials said.
   Three people, including a woman and two children, were reported
hospitalized with serious injuries.
   The latest deaths raised to at least 125 the number of civilians
slain in their villages since March 2. Most of the victims have
been members of the Sinhalese majority community on the island, but
22 of the victims were minority Tamils killed in a reprisal raid on
their community March 11.
   The military officials said today's attacks occurred shortly
after midnight in the villages of Pudukulam and Madavuvaithakulam.
They lie just south of Vavuniya, a town 130 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   The officials, who briefed reporters on condition their names
not be used, said at least six children and two women were among
the victims.
   They quoted police as blaming the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam for the attack. The Tigers militia, the largest of the Tamil
rebel groups, has rejected an Indian-backed peace accord aimed at
ending their nearly five-year separatist rebellion.
   Government officials have said the attacks on villages are aimed
at disrupting a long-running government resettlement program for
poor Sinhalese. Most of the slayings have occurred in the Eastern
District, where the resettlement program has been having the
greatest impact.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and
military.
   Moderate Tamils want more autonomy for their communites in the
north and east of Sri Lanka, where they predominate, while
militants are fighting for a separate nation.
   Sinhalese make up about 75 percent of the island's population.
The rest are Moslems and descendants of early European colonizers.
   After the peace accord was signed last July, India sent more
than 50,000 troops to the island to try to stop the Tigers'
continuing campaign.
   India has become involved because it has more than 60 million
ethnic Tamils in its own southern states who are sympathetic to
their Sri Lankan brethren.

<HEAD>Lawyer Accused in Judge's Killing Freed After 6{ Years Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former defense lawyer was freed after
spending more than six years in prison for conspiring in the murder
of a federal judge who was scheduled to preside at the drug trial
for the attorney's brother.
   ``I can't really tell you how good I feel,'' Joe Chagra said
Monday. ``It's probably the most exciting experience that I've ever
had, other than being there when my children were born.''
   Freedom after prison confinement is so profound, Chagra said,
that he ``won't do anything to endanger it.''
   Chagra, 41, was released on parole Friday from a federal prison
in Safford, Ariz., after serving almost 6{ years of a 10-year
sentence for conspiracy in the slaying of U.S. District Judge John
H. Wood Jr. of San Antonio.
   Wood, known as ``Maximum John'' for the stiff sentences he gave
drug dealers, was shot to death in San Antonio in 1979. The slaying
occurred just before Wood was to have presided at the drug-related
trial of Chagra's brother, Jimmy.
   Prosecutors later alleged that Joe Chagra, who had been
defending drug suspects, wanted Wood eliminated.
   Charles Harrelson, accused of being the triggerman in the Wood
slaying, was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in
prison. Joe Chagra pleaded guilty to conspiracy and testified
against Harrelson.
   Jimmy Chagra was found innocent of conspiracy in the slaying.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Question Officials Over Corruption Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today began questioning
top officials about allegations of fraud and influence peddling,
and an opposition party charged that President Roh Tae-woo aided
massive corruption.
   The Central Investigation Department of the Prosecutor General's
Office questioned six senior officials of the Saemaul Undong rural
and urban development group and banned 26 people implicated in the
investigation from leaving the country.
   Prosecutor Kang Won-il said officials of the home, agriculture
and fisheries, education and sports ministries along with Seoul
City government officials were being investigated to see if they
assisted fraud and corruption.
   A major scandal arose after the government began a probe into
allegations that Saemaul and government officials embezzled
millions of dollars, sold government patronage and forced
businesses to make illegal donations over the past six years.
   An initial investigation revealed evidence of fraud and other
crimes, including diversion of government and private subsidies and
concealment by government officials to protect Saemaul, prosecution
officials said.
   Interpol, the international police agency, had been asked to
help track down and return top Saemaul official Kim Chin-taek who
fled the country last month, Kang said.
   ``My investigation team will unearth all malpractices and make
public the results of the probe,'' Kang told reporters.
   Chun Kyung-hwan, the younger brother of former President Chun
Doo-hwan and former head of Saemaul, is one of the suspects under
investigation. The younger Chun returned to South Korea on Sunday
after fleeing to Japan last week when knowledge of the probe became
public.
   Prosecutors said they are investigating charges Saemaul
officials used ties with the government to enrich themselves and
government officials participated or covered up the corruption to
protect the administration.
   While he was president, Chun named his brother to head Saemaul,
but Chun is not being investigated in the scandal.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy, the country's second-largest
opposition party, today charged that President Roh aided Saemaul
officials involved in corruption when he was home minister in 1982.
The party demanded that Roh be investigated by prosecutors and said
it would conduct its own probe.
   The Blue House presidential office and prosecutors had no
immediate response to the party's allegations.
   Former President Chun, who left office Feb. 25 at the end of a
seven-year term, left Monday on a private visit to the United
States during which he is to meet President Reagan and other top
U.S. officials.
   The younger Chun, a powerful figure while his brother was in
office, resigned last year after being linked to gangsters who
staged a bloody underworld struggle for power. He indicated Monday
there had been irregularities within Saemaul but gave no details.
   Saemaul, a semi-private organization that worked closely with
government agencies, was formed in 1971 to improve urban and rural
living standards. Projects ranged from building model communities
to organizing city dwellers to keep streets clean.
   Critics contend Saemaul, which has offices across the country,
worked over the years with successive authoritarian governments by
promoting government interests and organizing support.
   Roh, a former general who help put President Chun in power with
military backing in 1980, promised during election campaigns late
last year to probe any official corruption under Chun. Roh was
elected on Dec. 16.
   Political sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say the
Roh government started the Saemaul probe to discredit the former
president, who has tried to retain influence within the government.
Several top Chun supporters were quietly dropped from the governing
Democratic Justice Party last week.
   But some government officials and leaders of the Democratic
Justice Party are concerned the Saemaul probe could blacken the
reputation of the Roh government because of its close ties to Chun.
   The party also is worried the investigation could hurt its
chances in National Assembly elections next month.

<TEXT>
   Wintry temperatures gripped the Northeast today as mild weather
prevailed over southern states.
   Temperatures were generally below freezing in the nation's
northeast quarter, with readings in the teens and single digits
over much of the Great Lakes region and the northern Atlantic Coast.
   A reading of 7 degrees shortly after midnight set a record in
Binghamton, N.Y. The old record low for the date was 8 degrees in
1965.
   In contrast, readings were in the 50s and 60s in the southern
and central Plains and the valleys and deserts of the Southwest.
Highs Monday were in the 80s.
   Wet weather was confined to widely scattered rainshowers in the
Northwest. Snow fell in some higher elevations, and snow advisories
were in effect for the Cascade Mountains, where 6 to 10 inches were
considered possible today and tonight.
   Clouds were over much of the Rockies, as well as the northern
Plains and the Northwest.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers in the Pacific
Northwest and southern Minnesota, possible snow in northern
Minnesota and scattered snow in northern Maine.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s or 60s across
much of the nation; the 20s across northern New England; the 30s
extending from the northern Great Lakes region into central and
southern New England; the 40s in northern Washington state, the
northern Rockies, the northern Plains, the upper Ohio Valley and
the Mid-Atlantic region; the 70s from the southern coast and
valleys of California to the southern Rockies, the lower half of
the Missouri Valley, the middle Mississippi Valley, the central
Gulf Coast and Florida; and the 80s from the desert Southwest to
southern Kansas, the southern Plains, the lower Mississippi valley
and Texas, with readings approaching 90 degrees from the central
Rio Grande Valley into the eastern Texas Panhandle.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from zero
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 70 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valentino's ready-to-wear show featured such
splendid finesse in details and fabrics that it should be called
haute couture.
   Famous for his tailoring, Valentino outdid himself in Monday's
show. Suits and dresses with jackets hugged the body and lean
skirts were just above the knee. Waists were always small, and
shoulders had enough padding for outline.
   Jackets included diagonally-striped suede numbers in russet,
ochre and purple with pompons at wrists and bodices. A handsome
raft of grey suits in plaids, stripes and checks had turned-up and
buttoned jacket hems.
   Boxy or fitted short alpaca coats in beige or bright colors or
pastel plaid capes were the only cover-ups to the fancy suit
display.
   The wrapped checked or black leather suits were crisscrossed
with black bands and bows, which also appeared on evening wear.
Valentino also fooled around with wool ropes for piping on black
and white suits.
   For evening wear, Valentino included satin rosettes and flowers,
intricate lace patterns on blouses, brocade galore in both trousers
and skirts.
   At Balmain, Erik Mortensen also showed sophisticated short looks
with the couture attention to detail, though the whole line was
simpler than Valentino's.
   There were new bolero-topped trouser suits in bright houndstooth
checks with fullish tops on the pants.
   In jewel tones, the slim knit sheaths with their triple-pleated
bands at the hip were pared-down elegance, while other outfits
showed the couture touch with diagonal rays of heavy welt seaming.
   The long pleated knit dinner skirts were applauded for their
easy wearability.
   Like Mortensen and Valentino, Marc Bohan at Dior aimed for
ladylike lines and fabrics, with not much except color to rock the
boat.
   Bohan kept to a basic daytime theme of blouson jackets with
raglan sleeves over a narrow, knee-baring skirt.
   Dazzling coats topped some of the short, bright suits, as other
suits were paired with brightly-striped puffy marabou jackets _ a
big trend for the Paris touch next winter.
   Flowered and satin-trimmed cocktail sheaths and suits also came
out in black velvet.
   Though Bohan's late-day wear was usually dressed-up and
sophisticated, he also showed flowered long or short sweaters over
fuchsia or emerald flowing satin culottes for an informal at-home
evening.

<HEAD>Over 9,000 Murders in Soviet Union Last Year, Radio Moscow Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 9,000 murders were committed in the
Soviet Union last year, but some types of major crimes declined due
to the Kremlin's campaign against drinking and drugs, Radio Moscow
reported.
   The state-run radio's report, in news bulletins on its
international English-language service, was believed to be the
first time the Soviets have made public a comprehensive annual
statistic for murders nationwide.
   For years, the Soviets used to contend that their society had
less crime than Western countries, but issued sparse statistics.
   Monday's Radio Moscow report was clearly linked to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or more openness
on some issues, that has brought franker reporting on the country's
social problems.
   ``Last year, slightly over 9,000 murders were registered in the
U.S.S.R., which is one third less than in the United States,''
Radio Moscow said, citing preliminary statistics.
   It did not say where the figures for U.S. homicides were
obtained. Official statistics for last year have not yet been
issued.
   In 1986, according to the FBI, there were 20,613 murders in the
United States, up 8.6 percent from 18,976 in 1985.
   Radio Moscow said there was a drop last year in the incidence of
some types of major crime in the Soviet Union, but gave no details.
   It quoted a Soviet legal expert, Dr. Igor Karpets, as crediting
the ``positive role of the anti-drinking and anti-drug drive''
launched under Gorbachev for the decline in some crimes.
   However, there was no decrease last year in crimes against
property, such as burglaries, Radio Moscow said, without providing
data.
   This year, police in Moscow have begun issuing weekly reports
through the official Tass news agency on the number of murders,
rapes and other crimes committed in the capital.
   Soviet officials are also working on a revision of the country's
criminal code.

<HEAD>Government Closes Anti-Apartheid Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today shut down
a militant anti-apartheid newspaper for 12 weeks, contending the
church-backed New Nation threatened public safety.
   A special decree issued by Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha
said further issues of the black-oriented weekly newspaper are
``totally prohibited'' through June 10.
   He acted a day after the newspaper, published by the Southern
African Catholic Bishops Conference, lost a court appeal seeking to
forestall government action while it challenged state-of-emergency
censorship regulations.
   Technically, the New Nation could resume publication after three
months, but Botha could close it again if its contents dissatisfied
him. The paper's senior staff has not announced whether operations
will be resumed after the suspension.
   With a circulation of 50,000 to 60,000, the 2-year-old newspaper
is the largest in South Africa to devote virtually its entire
content, including sports and entertainment sections, to
politically-related developments.
   The newspaper had a full-time staff of 22 and employed 32
correspondents who covered anti-apartheid activity in the rural
areas where the majority of blacks live. Several employees already
had resigned in anticipation of closure by Botha, who disclosed his
intentions in January.
   The newspaper's editor, Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been detained
without charge for 16 months. He joined the New Nation after a year
as a Niemann fellow at Harvard University.
   Authorities have banned four of the paper's editions and seized
two. Police have raided the paper's offices, and it was the first
of six publications warned by Botha that they could be closed for
three-month periods or censored for publishing material he found
objectionable.
   State-of-emergency regulations give Botha nearly unlimited
powers to deal with newspapers he feels might contribute to unrest.
He does not have to give reasons for his actions.
   The New Nation lost an initial court challenge of the
regulations and intends to pursue its case in an appellate court.
But on Monday, a Supreme Court rejected the newspaper's bid to
prevent closure during the appeal process.
   The New Nation's acting editor, Gabu Tugwana, said closure of
his paper would be ``an action against the whole media.''
   ``There are many more axes hanging in the air that will fall on
many others,'' he said, referring to warnings issued by Botha to
other publications.
   In a warning letter to the New Nation, Botha cited several items
which he said threatened public safety, promoted revolution,
enhanced the image of outlawed organizations or fomented hostility
toward the security forces.
   The items he listed included:
   _A picture of Oliver Tambo, president of the outlawed African
National Congress, opening a new office in Nairobi, Kenya.
   _A story about an arson attack on the offices of the United
Democratic Front, the nation's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
   _A picture of relatives of condemned blacks at a news conference
in which they appealed for clemency for 32 men and women sentenced
to hang.
   _An advertisement quoting a Psalm and urging the government to
abolish torture.

   Baton-wielding riot police scuffled with hundreds of
demonstrators protesting the U.S. military presence in Central
America and arrested about 275 people at federal buildings in San
Francisco and Minneapolis.
   Meanwhile, in Spokane, Wash., supporters of continued aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras waved signs that read, ``Contras Yes, Commies
No'' and ``Stop The Russians Before They Reach Our Borders.'' About
150 people on opposite sides of the issue gathered for peaceful
rallies in front of the federal courthouse.
   In San Francisco, a yelling, sign-toting crowd of more than 500
people encircled the Federal Building early Monday. Helmeted police
arrested 225 people.
   Shortly after the protest began at 7 a.m. Monday, San Francisco
police began making arrests for blocking entrances and the streets
around the 20-story building. The main entrance was closed, and for
about a half-hour the protesters blocked the rear entrance that
police were trying to keep open.
   More than 5,000 people work in the building.
   Some demonstrators held aloft a 6-foot-long sign reading, ``This
building closed for renovation of morals.'' Many held signs
insulting to President Reagan and shouted obscenities.
   Protesters shouted ``No Contra aid'' and ``U.S., CIA, out of
Nicaragua,'' as they marched in a ragged oval in front of the
closed main entrance, while early arrivals for work got in through
the back doors.
   At one point, screaming protesters swarmed against a lawyer
trying to get in. Police fought the demonstrators aside and pulled
the man through.
   Officers with visored helmets and batons marched on the double
from one street to another as protesters harassed them with quick
moves. Some protesters went limp and were dragged screaming to the
police vans.
   A man in his early 20s who didn't move fast enough for charging
police was hit in the mouth with a baton and bloodied.
   The demonstators were photographed and booked on the street
before being taken to the Hall of Justice for formal citations.
   Police, moving in with batons chest-high, began rounding up
demonstrators after police Capt. William Welch warned the hooting
crowd through a loudspeaker that they were illegally assembled and
ordered them to disperse. Some were charged with resisting arrest.
   In Minneapolis, riot police arrested about 50 protesters Monday
after they marched through downtown to the Federal Building, broke
a window and threw paint.
   Officers used 4-foot-long sticks to keep the crowd under
control, arrested demonstrators and dragged those who wouldn't go
peacefully to police vans. Officers also ripped some banners down
and tore them up, and used dogs to keep the streets clear.
   Some protesters said the police used excessive force.
   ``I moved out of the street real fast,'' said protester Pat
Powers, 52. ``The police obviously were looking for violence. In my
opinion the police incited the violence.''
   But Police Chief Tony Bouza said the officers' actions were
necessary.
   ``There's a limit to how much you can tolerate. It was getting
worse,'' Bouza said.

<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Suharto replaced nearly half
his Cabinet and appointed more than a dozen military men in their
place in a shake-up he said will bring new blood to the government.
   ``The new Cabinet will ensure the continuation of past policies
as well as tackle the problem of regeneration (of Indonesia's
leadership),'' Suharto said after announcing the new lineup on
television Monday.
   Among those replaced were Coordinating Minister for Economic
Affairs Ali Wardhana, Mines and Energy Minister Subroto and Foreign
Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja.
   Veteran Finance Minister Radius Prawiro, 59, will be sworn in
Wednesday to succeed Wardhana as economic czar, officials said.
Indonesia is Asia's largest debtor and Wardhana last month said
Jakarta had no intention of rescheduling its $42.1 billion foreign
debt.
   Wardhana, a 60-year-old civilian technocrat credited with
helping to restore the economy in the last 20 years, said privately
for some time that he wished to retire, diplomatic sources said.
   Subroto, who held the key energy portfolio for 10 years, is
being replaced by Col. Ginandjar Kartasasmita, 47, a Japan-trained
former head of the national investment board. He is regarded by
foreign businessmen as a tough negotiator. Indonesia's economy
remains heavily dependent on oil and natural gas exports and
Subroto represented the only Asian member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries at OPEC deliberations and once served
as head of the cartel.
   The new foreign minister is Ali Alatas, 55, who was ambassador
to the United Nations. Among Mochtar's unfinished business are
ambitions to play host to the next non-aligned summit and be
recognized as a leader of the Third World.
   Mochtar, 59, who leaves the Foreign Ministry job after 12 years,
spearheaded his country's efforts to project itself on the world
stage after years of playing a minor role.
   As expected, Gen. Benny Murdani, 55, replaced last month as
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, was named defense minister.
Murdani has long been regarded as one of the country's most
powerful figures.
   Only 18 ministers of the previous 40-member Cabinet were given
assignments in the new one which has 41.
   In addition to Murdani and the new armed forces chief, Gen. Try
Sutrisno, 53, who also holds Cabinet rank, 11 other active or
retired military officers were appointed. They included Gen.
Rudini, 58, as Home Affairs Minister and Admiral Sudomo, 61, as
Political and Security Minister, both of whom are retired.
   Suharto, 66, rules the world's fifth most populous nation _ 147
million in 1980 _ with the backing of the armed forces.
   The retired general, who is starting his fifth five-year term,
took power in 1965 following the abortive communist coup. He is the
third longest-ruling leader in Asia after Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew
and North Korea's Kim Il Sung.

   Authorities searched today for a teen-ager
who fled his family's apartment moments after letting his aunt
inside, where she found four family members dead in a bathtub,
police said.
   The bodies of Catalino Hernandez, 45; his wife, Carmen, 23, who
was four months pregnant; and their children, Jonathan, 9 months,
and Frankie, 6, were discovered Monday morning, police said.
   Autopsies determined that Frankie died of suffocation and
strangulation and Jonathan died from a skull fracture after being
struck with a blunt object, said Dr. Halbert Fillinger, assistant
medical examiner.
   Autopsies were still being conducted on Hernandez and his wife,
authorities said. According to radio station KYW-AM, each was shot
once in the head.
   The bodies of the two adults were discovered in the tub Monday
morning. The two children's bodies were underneath them and went
unnoticed until several hours later, when their parents' bodies
were removed, police said. There was no water in the tub.
   Authorities were looking for Jose Hernandez, 17, who is
Hernandez's son by a previous marriage in Puerto Rico, for
questioning.
   ``We don't know what his role in the crime is,'' said Capt.
Robert J. Grasso. ``We are trying to locate him to question him to
find out what happened here.''
   The youth was taken out of school Monday by an aunt who became
worried when she was unable to contact the family, police said.
When she went to the family's second-floor apartment with the boy,
he let her in, then fled, police and family members said.
   ``Jose told her that he knew where the family was,'' said
Catalino Hernandez, Sr., the slain man's father. Jose went with her
and opened the door ``but as soon as he opened the apartment, he
was away and gone.''
   A relative saw Jose Hernandez run to a car and drive off Monday
morning, police said. The woman told a neighbor she saw a bloody
knife on the front seat of the car as the teen drove away. She said
Jose refused to answer her questions.
   The four had apparently been dead at least two or three days,
Grasso said.

<TEXT>
   Police detained scores of people in
anti-government protests in two cities that featured dolls with
dark glasses resembling those worn by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, opposition spokesmen said.
   Opposition activists in the southwest city of Wroclaw said
hundreds of people assembled on a main street Monday demanding
freedom for Waldemar Fydrych, head of the satirical street theater
group, Orange Alternative.
   Police in the port city of Gdansk on Sunday detained 18 members
of a banned peace group who planned to throw an effigy with dark
spectacles into the Baltic Sea, an opposition activist said.
   Participants on Monday chanted ``Spring in, Fydrych out!'' while
carrying three ``Marzanna'' dolls with dark glasses, activists said.
   The dolls were related to the Polish folk custom of drowning
``Marzanna,'' a rag-and-stick figure representing winter, on the
first day of spring.
   Fydrych is serving a two-month jail sentence for organizing
similar demonstrations in the past.
   The demonstration on Monday drew 3,000 spectators, said activist
Barbara Labuda. Police at first checked IDs, but then began hauling
the protesters away, she said.
   Mrs. Labuda and an Orange Alternative member, Krzysztof Albin,
said police later used tear gas and struck people with truncheons.
Another activist, Jozef Pinior, said he could not confirm the
report.
   Pinior said 150 people were detained, most briefly. Mrs. Labuda
and Albin said the number was higher.
   A police duty officer in Wroclaw said he knew nothing about any
demonstrations.
   Janina Wehrstein, a spokeswoman for the Freedom and Peace group
in Gdansk, said the 18 people detained in Wroclaw on Sunday planned
to toss a dark-spectacled doll from a pier into the Baltic on
Monday.
   Five of the 18 were released after a few hours, but the others
were held overnight at a police station, she said.
   Freedom and Peace opposes Poland's universal military draft and
demands alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented number of dissidents and
intellectuals from six East European nations have signed an appeal
for recognition of the right to object to military service.
   The appeal, published Monday in Vienna, was signed by 77
Soviets, including Andrei Sakharov, nuclear physicist and 1975
Nobel Peace laureate.
   The signatories from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union,
East Germany, Poland and Yugoslavia called for recognition ``of
citizens' right to conscientious objection and alternative
service.''
   The appeal was addressed to the 35-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe, which has been meeting in Vienna since
November 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Accords
on military security, economic coopertion and humanitarian issues.
   The appeal asked the delegations to work toward an agreement on
the right not to serve in the military.
   Hungarian dissident writer Miklos Haraszti, who signed the
appeal and helped initiate it, told a news conference Monday that
conscientious objection was one of the main reasons for political
imprisonment in Eastern Europe.
   ``Hundreds of our East European compatriots are sent to prison
because of their non-violent conscientious stands,'' the appeal
said. ``These young men would like to serve the community by caring
for the old and sick instead of performing military service.''
   Haraszti said no country in the Warsaw Pact allows its citizens
the right to object to military service, while NATO countries do.
   ``Eastern Europe punishes people for not wanting to look at
other countries as enemies,'' he said.
   Haraszti said 438 people and groups have signed the appeal so
far.
   The London-based East European Cultural Foundation, which helped
coordinate collecting signatures, said in a news release it was the
first time a large number of Soviet citizens joined a joint East
bloc initiative.
   Haraszti said the appeal, the fourth such joint effort of East
European dissidents, carried the largest number of signatures so
far.
   Peter Uhl, a member of the Czechoslovak human rights group
Charter 77, was invited to come to Vienna for presentation of the
appeal.
   However, in a letter read in part at the news conference and
then distributed, Uhl complained that ``no Czechoslovak citizens,
including those who have passports, could go to Vienna in response
to your invitation.''
   His letter said, ``Internationalization of our demands ... is
also very important because it provides a comparison between the
legal and factual state of affairs prevailing in the individual
East European countries.''
   Dissidents in East bloc countries estimated the total number of
people in prison for objecting to military service at about 300 to
400.

   Three former Du Pont Co. employees who
won a $75 million personal injury award say they hope to give $67.5
million to six institutions to help others who suffer from exposure
to asbestos.
   ``We are making these donations as our best effort to try to
help our fellow asbestos victims, as well as to help assure that
this kind of abuse of public trust will never happen again,''
William Kapp Jr., 55, one of the victims and spokesman for the
group, said Monday.
   Kapp of Elkton, Md.; James Webb, 74, of Newport; and Joseph
Kaster, 71, of the Newport area said the money would be donated if
the damage award is upheld on appeal.
   In November, a Superior Court jury ordered Raymark Industries
Inc. of Trumbull, Conn., to pay the men and their wives punitive
damages for conspiring to hide the health hazards of asbestos.
   Judge Clarence W. Taylor has yet to decide whether to uphold the
award. If it is upheld, Raymark plans to appeal, according to
LeGrande L. Young, Raymark general counsel.
   Even if it is upheld, Kapp said he realizes the award may never
be paid for several reasons, including the fact there are still 350
asbestos-related cases pending against Raymark in Delaware, and
last week a mistrial was declared in a trial in which Raymark was
ordered to pay $22 million to two other former Du Pont employees.
   If Taylor upholds the $75 million, Kapp said it could force
Raymark into bankruptcy.
   ``This way, someone will get something. We're not trying to hog
it all. If we force them into (bankruptcy), it will at least go to
charity,'' Kapp said.
   ``On the question of bankruptcy, that's a possibility,'' Young
said.
   Raymark does not have $75 million, but does have more than that
in insurance, he said.
   The National Campaign Against Toxic Hazards, a toxic victims
advocacy group based in Boston, was earmarked for $13 million of
the award.
   Other institutions to receive $13 million each would be the
Mount Sinai School of Environmental Medicine in New York; the
University of Delaware School of Business; the Medical Center of
Delaware's Carpenter Clinic for Cancer Research; and the
Baltimore-based White Lung Association for asbestos victims.
   The Emily P. Bissell Hospital for the critically ill in Newport
was earmarked for $2.5 million.

<TEXT>
   Actors in television and radio commercials
set aside script lines for picket lines, launching the second day
of the second strike to hit the entertainment industry this month.
   ``We are now officially on strike against the producers of
television and radio commericals. ... No new negotiations are
scheduled,'' said a spokesman on a taped hotline recording today at
the Screen Actors Guild.
   The 100,000 joint members of the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Radio and Television Artists called their
strike Monday against the Joint Policy Committee of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National
Advertisers.
   The union rejected a management offer of immediate fee increases
in exchange for dropping a cost-of-living adjustment, and
advertisers refused to accept a proposed ``tiered'' pay system for
cable TV commercials based on the number of cable subscribers.
   The strike, which affects only radio and television commercials,
is the second by Hollywood talent unions in less than a month. The
Writers Guild of America has entered the third week of its walkout
against motion picture and television producers.
   John A. McGuinn, the chief management negotiator, urged
advertising companies to hire non-union talent, but some companies
said they would wait out the strike before beginning new ad
campaigns.
   ``The ads with non-union actors just won't look as good. It will
be a lot like the replacement players who filled in during the
football strike,'' said one advertising executive, who asked not to
be named.
   The Los Angeles office of the New York advertising firm Della
Femina, Travisano & Partners said it probably will hold off on new
ads for one of its major clients, Isuzu. Actor David Leisure, who
plays the part of outrageous liar Joe Isuzu, is a guild member.
   The striking actors on Monday picketed offices of the Ogilvy and
Mather agency in Los Angeles and Honolulu. In New York City,
strikers set up picket lines at General Motors Plaza during a GM
board meeting. Pickets also walked in Chicago and Miami.
   Ken Orsatti, SAG's national executive secretary, sent telegrams
to the major candidates asking them to use only ads with union
actors by signing interim agreements with the unions.
   McGuinn, however, said the advertising companies ``don't see any
problem during a strike.''
   ``We're producing commercials today; we're producing commercials
tomorrow,'' he said. ``We have non-union talent that's willing to
work. Our doors are open.''
   Meanwhile, there were no talks scheduled between the
9,000-member Writers Guild of America and the producers' alliance
to end that strike. However, a guild spokesman said scriptwriters
are ready to return to the bargaining table.
   Scriptwriters have demanded higher fees from foreign
distribution, more creative control and a management proposal to
restructure fees for one-hour television shows sold into
syndication.

<TEXT>
   A girl who became the first cancer patient to
receive a bone-marrow transplant through a computerized national
registry apparently is free of leukemia, hospital officials say.
   Brooke Ward, 7, will return home Saturday to Raleigh, N.C.
Recent tests have found no cancer and, at 100 days, her operation
at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute is considered a
success.
   One thing Brooke apparently won't miss is the attention that
accompanied publicity for the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry,
based in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
   ``Mommy,'' Brooke complained, holding out her arms to mother
Margurite Ward as a reporter and photographer approached. ``Not
this again.''
   ``The reason we agreed to the media coverage is that we wanted
people to know about the registry,'' Mrs. Ward said. ``We wanted
people to know a bone marrow transplant could be done with a
non-related donor.''
   The registry located Diane Walters, 49, of Milwaukee, whose
tissue type matched Brooke's. The transplant was performed Dec. 16.
   ``She's doing fine,'' Mrs. Ward said. ``I just feel Brooke is
going to make it. She's already beaten the odds.''
   Another piece of the story is fund-raising _ a tough job without
news coverage.
   Bone-marrow transplants like Brooke's cost an average of
$100,000, and fund-raising for her treatment began even before the
registry match.
   The family is covered by private insurance for 80 percent of the
transplant costs. Fund-raising was still necessary to cover the
expenses of moving to Seattle, loss of income or any further
medical costs.
   ``Without the media coverage it would have been real hard to
raise the money,'' Mrs. Ward said.
   ``There are a lot of people who can't get a transplant because
they can't get funds,'' said Susan Edmonds, a spokeswoman for Fred
Hutchinson. The non-profit cancer center is prohibited from doing
fund-raising for individuals.

<TEXT>
   Serious legal problems have blocked the
extradition of a former Argentine general accused of overseeing
mass kidnappings and murder during his country's military rule in
the 1970s.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Zanides on Monday acknowledged that
the five-year deadline under U.S. law for charging Carlos Suarez
Mason with the 23 kidnappings already has expired.
   Zanides blames Carlos Suarez Mason for ``a systematic pattern of
abduction, torture and murder'' by his troops in Argentina during
the military rule of the late 1970s.
   Zanides urged U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen to apply
California law in the extradition hearings, under which the
kidnappings could still be prosecuted. But under questioning from
Jensen, Zanides conceded that there was no precedent for such a
ruling.
   Suarez Mason, 63, commander of the First Army Corps in Buenos
Aires from 1976 to 1978, is charged separately with the murders of
43 people, mostly prisoners, by his troops during the so-called
``dirty war'' against suspected leftists.
   After serving as head of the joint chiefs of staff and the
state-run oil monopoly, he fled when a civilian government came to
power in 1983. He was arrested in January 1986 at his home in
Foster City, south of San Francisco, and is being held without bail.
   Jensen is expected to rule on the extradition later. After a
hearing that lasted nearly all day, he called a recess until April
6 and indicated he may rule then.
   The judge ruled favorably for the prosecution on one issue,
refusing to admit testimony aimed at showing that the charges and
extradition were politically motivated because President Raul
Alfonsin, an opponent of the former military government, promised
to prosecute generals during his campaign in 1983.
   Suarez Mason's lawyers argue he was not responsible for his
soldiers' actions and that the actions were ``political,'' and
therefore exempt from extradition under the treaty between the
United States and Argentina.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization has adopted an austerity
program in a bid to lure the United States and Britain into
rejoining, the general-secretary said.
   The general-secretary, Frederico Mayor, announced the plan
Monday after arriving in Harare on a four-day visit to Zimbabwe.
Mayor, 52, a former Spanish Minister of Education, became UNESCO
chief in November.
   The United States and Britain, once two of the largest
contributors to UNESCO's budget, quit the organization in 1984 and
1985 to protest the organization's alleged anti-Western bias and
squandering of resources.
   Addressing a news conference in Harare, Mayor said the austerity
plan include a 50 percent cut in UNESCO documentation. The number
of meetings was also cut by 25 percent, and other steps were taken
to increase efficiency and create ``less ambiguity'' in the work of
the Paris-based body.
   He did not give further details of the plan, but said he had
written to the United States, Britain and Singapore, which also
quit the organization, asking them to reconsider their membership.
   Mayor will meet with President Robert Mugabe and government
ministers.

   When 18- to 44-year-old Americans were asked
which leaders they admired most in the past 20 years, they picked
two men who were assassinated 20 years ago _ Martin Luther King Jr.
and Robert F. Kennedy.
   Thirty-eight percent of those responding to the poll conducted
for Rolling Stone magazine said they admired King the most, citing
his stand on civil rights.
   The respondents who chose King and the 25 percent who chose
second-place Robert F. Kennedy said they were eloquent leaders who
stood for peace, justice, tolerance and equality.
   The magazine noted that both politicians were assassinated
before realizing their dreams and that their ``blighted legacy'' is
a theme that surfaces throughout the survey.
   President Reagan was also chosen as most admired by 25 percent
of those surveyed, but he also had a high negative rating _ 10
percent picked him as the public figure they respected the least.
   Asked under what circumstances they would enlist for military
service, 60 percent of all respondents and 73 percent of men said
they would enlist if war broke out on the North American continent.
   Only 27 percent said they would enlist if our close European
allies were attacked. Twenty-five percent of all respondents and 15
percent of the men said they would not join the military under any
circumstances.
   Twelve percent said politics was very important in their lives,
41 percent said somewhat important, 30 percent not very important,
16 percent not at all important and one percent were not sure.
   The survey found that 48 percent of respondents believe families
need two incomes in order to survive.
   Results from the poll, conducted last September by Peter D. Hart
Research Associates, appear in the April 7 issue of the magazine
which went on sale today.
   The poll is based on interviews with 816 respondents at their
homes, the magazine said. The margin of error survey is plus or
minus four percent for questions involving all respondents, and
slightly higher for subgroups.

   A pre-dawn fire that apparently started
when a cigarette ignited a mattress swept through part of a
suburban hotel today, killing four guests and injuring seven
others, police said.
   A 7-year-old child and a handicapped man were among the dead at
the four-story Hotel Tivoli in the Brussels suburb of Laken. Of the
seven people injured, two were in serious condition, said a police
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official said the identities of the victims were not yet
known but said three of the victims were Africans.
   Police said the fire was most probably caused when someone's
cigarette ignited a mattress on the second floor.
   A police patrol noticed the fire minutes after it started at
3:30 a.m. and immediately warned emergency services. Police and
neighbors meanwhile rescued people while awaiting the firefighters,
the official said.
   One guest was hospitalized with injuries after jumping from the
second floor. Another guest was found unconscious in his room and
also was hospitalized.
   The fire swept through half of the fully-booked hotel, causing
about $57,000 in damage, police said.

   A pair of bachelor brothers who quietly
amassed a small fortune left more than $1.5 million to the high
school they attended more than 70 years ago.
   For most of this century, Arthur and Edgar Simionescu lived
quietly together in a modest way but the brothers, who lived into
their 90s, amassed a fortune through shrewd investments in stocks
and bonds.
   They left all their money _ estimated at more than $1.5 million
after taxes _ to Hackensack High School for a college-scholarship
endowment
   ``This was really a drop out of the blue,'' said principal
Harold Bloom, who, like his colleagues, never heard of the
Simionescus until after they died in 1986, three months apart.
   ``It totally surprised us. What should I say? It's like manna.''
   Neither Edgar, a machinist, nor Arthur, a stamp collector who
was confined to a wheelchair because of a teen-age bout with polio,
ever went to college.
   Edgar entered Hackensack High in 1904, and Arthur followed five
years later, but they were never big boosters after graduating.
   ``They wanted to do something that would have some longevity to
it. I think they wanted to help young people,'' said their lawyer,
Eugene Gilmartin.
   The brothers had investments _ some dating back to the 1920s _
in dozens of companies, ranging from Atlantic Richfield to United
Jersey Bank.
   When Arthur died in 1986 of heart failure, Edgar's health was
failing, and he was never told his brother was dead. But he kept
asking for Arthur. Edgar died three months later, also of heart
failure.
   Their bequest should provide more than $100,000 in scholarships
a year.

<TEXT>
   A sixth-grader has admitted
shooting a friend to death and been sentenced to six years of
probation for his manslaughter plea.
   Frank Melo Jr., 13, was indicted on second-degree murder charges
by a Broward County grand jury for the Dec. 26, 1986, shooting of
Steven Mumford of Hollywood.
   Prosecutors offered the youth a plea bargain that was approved
Monday by Broward Circuit Judge M. Daniel Futch, who withheld
adjudication, a formal finding of guilt. If the boy successfully
completes probation, his record will show no conviction.
   Futch warned the teary eyed boy that consequences would be
severe if he violated probation terms, which include receiving
psychological counseling and not using a firearm without court
approval.
   ``If you don't believe that, you ask anybody,'' said Futch,
nicknamed ``Maximum Dan'' because of the stiff sentences he hands
out. ``I'll put you in jail.''
   The shooting occurred when the Mumfords were visiting Melo's
family. The boy said the shooting was an accident, but Stanley
Mumford, the dead boy's father, contended it was not.
   Prosecutor Kelly Hancock said Steven Mumford, 12, had angered

   Promoters have handed out the first $1.5
million raised from a concert to benefit Vietnam vets that featured
such artists as Neil Diamond, Linda Ronstadt, and Crosby Stills &
Nash.
   The money was given to 10 Midwest and West Coast-based veterans
organizations, officials said.
   Ten East Coast groups were to receive checks today, said Jo
Ellen ``Joey'' Talley, producer of the concert and president of
Welcome Home Inc., the non-profit entertainment industry group that
organized the 4th of July event in Washington, D.C. last year.
   More than $2 million has been raised from the ``Welcome Home''
concert, and another $300,000 is to be given three Michigan groups
in May, she said.
   The presentation was made in Los Angeles by Ms. Talley and
actors Peter Fonda and Lou Gossett Jr., who serve on Welcome Home's
board of directors.
   The $1.5 million was raised during a 4{-hour concert. On stage
for the event, broadcast on cable, were Diamond, Stevie Wonder,
James Ingram, Miss Ronstadt, and Crosby Stills & Nash.
   The money benefits such groups as the Greeley, Colo., chapter of
the Disabled American Veterans, which was awarded $30,000, and the
Atlanta Vietnam Veterans Resource Center, which was awarded
$133,500.
   Funds raised are intended to benefit the neediest of veterans
and their families, including those who are homeless, jobless or
suffer from alcohol or drug addictions, Ms. Talley said.

   Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian
man in the occupied West Bank during a clash with protesters
hurling rocks, metal bars and bottles, an army spokeswoman said
today.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the body of another Palestinian was
found in an orchard in the village of Beit Hanoun, Israel radio
said.
   The army denied involvement in the Gaza death, but a resident of
the village said the man's family believed he had been beaten by
soldiers. His skull was crushed.
   In the West Bank, the army spokeswoman said an Arab's body was
found this morning after a Monday night clash in Tubas, a village
50 miles north of Jerusalem.
   The Arab-owned Palestine Press Service identified the man as
26-year-old Hikmet Drajmeh. The agency said troops shot and wounded
two more protesters, one of them seriously, but the army denied the
report.
   The spokeswoman, who could not be identified under army
regulations, said the clash erupted when hundreds of Palestinians
attacked an army patrol with rocks, metal bars and bottles.
   ``The soldiers shot to extricate themselves from a
life-threatening situation,'' she said.
   The killing brought the Palestinian death toll to 107 in almost
four months of unrest, according to unofficial U.N. figures. One
Israeli soldier has been killed by Arab gunfire.
   In the Gaza Strip, a military spokesman said no troops had been
in Beit Hanoun Monday and so the army could not have been involved.
A resident said the victim's family suspected the army was
responsible because the body was found in an isolated area off
limits to villagers.
   A third Palestinian died today when he was shot from a passing
car in the southern Gaza Strip by assailants assumed to be Arabs,
Israel army radio said. An army spokesman said the motive was
apparently criminal.
   Both Gaza killings were turned over to the police, the army
said. But Gaza police officials were quoted by Israel radio as
saying they were unable to investigate many crimes due to the mass
resignations last week of 380 Arab officers.
   The officers resigned along with most of their Arab colleagues
in the West Bank in accordance with orders issued by underground
leaders of what Palestinians call ``the uprising.''
   In other casualties today, officials at the Ahli Arab hospital
in Gaza City said two men were admitted with injuries inflicted by
Israeli troops.
   In other West Bank unrest, an Israeli driver fired shots near
the Balata refugee camp near Nablus after his car was stoned,
Israel radio reported. There were no injuries.
   In the West Bank, members of two Arab councils resigned today a
day after an underground leaflet called for Israeli-appointed
municipal officials to leave their jobs.
   Palestinian leaders also called for increased attacks with
stones, firebombs and iron bars on Israeli security forces and
Jewish settlers.
   The call came as several center-left Israeli politicians and
writers joined right-wing leaders in demanding tougher measures to
quell the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Also Monday, the army issued a new regulation that will allow
the detention of any security prisoner for up to six months with
less judicial review. The previous edict required a military judge
to review each case within 96 hours.
   Officials said the new regulation would ease the overload on the
military court system that has handled nearly 3,000 cases since the
violent demonstrations began in the occupied lands on Dec. 8.
   And Israeli troops on Monday expanded their search for weapons
in the occupied lands following the fatal shooting Sunday of
Israeli Sgt. Moshe Katz in Bethlehem.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin lifted restrictions barring
soldiers from shooting at rioters throwing firebombs and for the
first time the army destroyed the homes of three Arabs suspected of
throwing such missiles.
   The increasing violence in the occupied lands drew demands for
action from Israelis usually opposed to the measures of the
rightist Likud coalition led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Amnon Lynn, a legislator from the opposition Labor Party, told
Itim on Monday: ``The political echelon must understand we cannot
continue with the policy of restraint. There is a time to hold back
and a time to attack. The time has come for Israel to respond with
force.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists have doubled the five-year
survival rate of early-stage lung cancer patients by activating
their immune systems to attack cancerous cells, a researcher
reports.
   Patients who received the experimental therapy showed a 63
percent survival rate five years after cancer surgery, compared
with 33 percent for patients who received no treatment after
surgery, said Ariel Hollinshead of the George Washington University
Medical Center.
   ``It's come off very well,'' Hollinshead said Monday after
describing results to science writers at an American Cancer Society
symposium.
   Surgery to remove lung cancer tumors often leaves cancer cells
behind. In the new treatment, patients were injected after surgery
with proteins drawn from other lung cancer tumors. Those antigens
helped the body defend against cancer cells left behind by surgery,
Hollinshead said.
   Other cancer experts said they were impressed but added that
more work was needed.
   For early-stage cancer, ``it looks like it's going to give
people at least a 50 percent chance of being around five years
later,'' while other post-surgical treatment does little good, said
John Minton, professor of surgical oncology at the Ohio State
University College of Medicine in Columbus, Ohio.
   ``The problem is, it's small numbers,'' he said of the trial,
which included 81 patients. ``It looks good, but we need more
numbers.''
   Any time such a jump in survival rates can be demonstrated,
``you've got to be impressed,'' said Dick Rauscher, senior cancer
society vice president for research.
   But he said that as with any such finding, he wants to see
another group of researchers achieve the same success to confirm
the effectiveness of the therapy.
   Hollinshead said the results are part of a 234-patient study
that recently reported five-year survival rates of 69 percent in
the treated group and 49 percent in the untreated group.
   Lung cancer is the nation's leading cancer killer, every year
striking 152,000 Americans and killing 139,000.
   Only about 30 percent of lung cancer cases at most are diagnosed
as early in their progression as the cases in the study, Rauscher
said.
   The cancers in the 81 patients were confined to the lung tissue
or spread only to nearby lymph nodes, representing so-called stages
1 and 2. In later stages, cancer spreads elsewhere in the body.
   All the patients went through surgery to remove cancerous
tissue. The experimental therapy began about two weeks later,
Hollinshead said.
   Once a month for three months, they were injected with doses of
proteins called antigens that had been purified from other lung
cancer tumors.
   The injections spurred the immune system into raising defenses
aimed at cells bearing the same kinds of antigens. So the body was
primed to ``mop up'' cancer cells missed by the surgery,
Hollinshead said.
   Fifty-three patients received the experimental therapy with
injections in one or both arms, while the untreated 28 patients
were simply followed for comparison purposes.
   Side effects were limited to a slight fever overnight and skin
irritation at the injection sites, Hollinshead said.
   Standard treatment after surgery often involves just waiting to
see if any further cancer crops up, said Minton. Radiation is
sometimes used, but ``the five-year results are terrible. They're
like you didn't get much treatment at all.''
   Chemotherapeutic drugs do not help either, said Rauscher.
   James B.D. Mark, head of the division of thoracic surgery at the
Stanford University School of Medicine, said previous attempts at
immune system-based therapy had not met with such success.
   But he said a potential weak point in the study was the mixing
of stage 1 and stage 2 patients, because they have such different
natural five-year survival rates, respectively of more than 60
percent and about 30 percent or less.
   Hollinshead replied that patients were assigned randomly to
treatment or the non-treatment groups, so that those two groups
remained comparable.

<HEAD>Israel Condemned, Iraq Claims Iran Helping Jewish Immigration To
Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers from Moslem countries
today condemned Israel's ``oppressive measures'' against rioters in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The ministers of the 46-member Organization of Islamic
Conference said in a statement that ``all Moslems in the world are
proud of this uprising.''
   They called for political and financial aid for the rebellion. A
Palestine Liberation Organization official, speaking just before a
plenary meeting at which the foreign ministers approved the
statement, hailed the support they were giving to the ``uprising.''
   In another development, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in a
closed committee session claimed that Iran was facilitating the
emigration of Iranian Jews to Israel. Iran has denied the charge.
   Jordanian Foreign Minister Taher Masri said Iran and Iraq were
unlikely to negotiate on peace during the Amman meeting, in part
because of the low-ranking level of the Iranian delegation.
   The ministers in their statement said the conference ``denounces
the oppressive and criminal measures by the (Israeli) authorities
against our brothers, the people in the occupied territories.''
   ``Members of the organization are concerned to support
Palestinians financially, politically and morally and also to back
their sole legitimate representative, the PLO,'' the statement said.
   It did not elaborate on the form this aid would take.
   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of PLO's political department, the
equivalent of the organization's foreign ministry, said the
ministers' backing was especially valuable ``for the people inside
the territories.''
   He spoke the day after King Hussein, in an opening address at
the conference, called for the Moslem world to support the
``uprising.''
   More than 100 Palestinians have died in the violent protests in
the territories Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War. Israel
seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
   Kaddoumi, who is heading the PLO's delegation at the Islamic
meeting, condemned U.S. moves to close the guerrilla group's office
in New York, accredited to the United Nations.
   ``We will keep the office open until American police come and
seal it off,'' he said. ``Then we will go to the United Nations
(enclave) and live there.''
   Aziz, reading in a closed session a statement that was made
available to The Associated Press by a source close to the
conference, said the alleged help given to Iranian Jews for
emigration to Israel was ``a violation of the rules of the''
organization.
   He did not elaborate, but asked the organization to study this
issue from all sides.
   ``How come Iran, which claims to support the Palestinian issue
and the uprising, is helping Jews to migrate to Israel.''
   He provided no figures on the migration. Iran has already denied
the charge.

<HEAD>Honolulu's Mayor Moves To Crack Down On Japanese Investment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Frank Fasi has proposed legislation to
stop foreign investors from purchasing some kinds of property in
Hawaii, saying the measure would put an end to skyrocketing housing
and real estate costs.
   The mayor on Monday sent a bill to the state Legislature that
would ban the sale of residential, agricultural or preservation
land to non-Americans. The bill does not cover commercial, resort
and industrial properties.
   The mayor's move comes as the state attempts to deal with a
recent wave of foreign investment that has caused property values
to jump in some areas. The investment has been spurred by the fall
of the dollar's value against the Japanese yen.
   ``What has triggered my action is the Japanese buyer with his
cheap dollars,'' Fasi told the Professional Women's Network on
Monday. ``They have been buying homes in several areas of Oahu,
forcing values to unprecedented levels.''
   Fasi said he does not consider his move protectionist.
   ``I believe in free and open trade between most countries,''
Fasi said. ``But I also believe in fairness, and what I see
happening here is not fair to Americans.''
   A spokesman for state Senate President Richard Wong said Fasi's
bill was under review and may be included in the legislative agenda.
   The City Council is considering a number of bills to curb
Japanese investment and ease the property tax burden on Oahu
homeowners.

<HEAD>Police Report Widespread Unrest During Protest Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two blacks were killed, seven
injured and 39 arrested during a nationwide protest strike that
brought the most extensive violence this year, police reported
today.
   Dozens of buses, delivery vans and private cars were stoned or
firebombed on Monday, the 28th anniversary of the Sharpeville
massacre, and in many cases security forces used tear gas, rubber
bullets, birdshot and dogs to disperse rioters, police headquarters
said.
   Police said the two deaths and five of the injuries resulted
from attacks by blacks on blacks. Two blacks were injured by police.
   Several of those arrested were trying to prevent children from
going to school and workers from going to work, police said.
   The protest strike was organized by anti-apartheid activists in
defiance of emergency regulations barring calls for such actions.
Hundreds of thousands of black workers and students stayed away
from jobs and classes, both to mark the anniversary of the 1960
police shootings of 69 blacks in Sharpeville and to protest the
recent bannings of black opposition groups.
   The Department of Education and Training said class boycotts
were reported at 694 of the black schools under its control, 9
percent of the total.
   The Star of Johannesburg, the country's largest daily newspaper,
said protest strikes would continue ``as long as grievances are not
directly addressed.''
   ``Instead of tension being relieved through the extension of
rights and the removal of restrictions, each new round of protests
is met with further clamps which inevitably lead to fresh
protests.''
   Five students from Johannesburg's University of the
Witwatersrand went to local police headquarters today with a bunch
of roses for Rosemary Hunter, the president of the student council
who was detained under state-of-emergency regulations Monday.
   The students said a police lieutenant refused to accept the
bouquet and told them: ``This is a police station, not a hospital.''
   Ms. Hunter, a law student, was taken from her parents' home at
dawn Monday.
   Police have not commented on the detention.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Patrick Steptoe, the gynecologist who
pioneered the test- tube baby technique that made parenthood
possible for thousands of otherwise infertile couples, has died at
age 74.
   A family announcement today said Steptoe had been suffering from
cancer. He died Monday night in the Chaucer Hospital in Canterbury,
62 miles southeast of London.
   Steptoe continued working until recently despite deteriorating
health, his longtime partner, physiologist Robert Edwards, said.
   ``It is a very great loss to Bourn Hall (their clinic) and to me
personally,'' said Edwards. ``In the last three years he was
working under considerable difficulties, but carried on.''
   Together, Steptoe and Edwards were responsible for the world's
first test tube baby, Louise Joy Brown, born at Oldham in northern
England on July 25, 1978.
   The announcement of the birth of the healthy baby from an embryo
fertilized outside her mother's womb caused shock waves at the
time. The test-tube baby technique, known as in vitro
fertilization, has since been used in clinics around the world.
   Louise Brown's birth was hailed as a miracle by some and
criticized as a wrong use of scientific techniques by others,
including the Roman Catholic Church.
   But Steptoe avoided the controversy.
   ``I am not a wizard or a Frankenstein,'' he said. ``All I want
to do is to help women whose child-producing mechanism is slightly
faulty.''
   Louise, now a schoolgirl, was conceived after an egg was removed
from her mother, Lesley Brown, and fertilized outside the womb with
the sperm of her husband, truck driver John Brown. Returned to the
womb, the embryo developed a normal pregnancy.
   In their early years of research in the late 1960s and early
1970s, Steptoe and Edwards were ostracized by much of the medical
establishment and once turned down for a Medical Research Council
grant. But that changed after Louise's birth. Last year, Steptoe
and Edwards were made Commanders of the British Empire, and Steptoe
also received one of Britain's highest academic honors and was made
a Fellow of the Royal Society.
   In vitro fertilization was devised mainly to relieve infertility
in women with blocked or damaged Fallopian tubes _ the normal site
of conception.
   Under the procedure, ova are removed from the woman and
fertilized with the prospective father's sperm in a laboratory
dish. Resulting embryos _ often more than one _ then are implanted
in the womb.
   Some embryos are now frozen for later use. There have been
thousands of babies born worldwide to otherwise infertile couples
as a result of in vitro fertilization.
   Steptoe, who was born June 9, 1913, qualified as a doctor in
1939 and immediately went into World War II service as a Royal Navy
surgeon. He was a prisoner of war in Italy from 1941 to 1943, and
was demobilized with the rank of Surgeon Lieutenant Commander in
1946.
   He worked as an obstetrician in state hospitals, moving in 1951
to Oldham, a grimy northern England city where in the fall of 1967
he teamed up with Edwards, a Cambridge University physiologist.
   They formed a trusted friendship and set up a research
laboratory at Oldham.
   Steptoe, silver-haird, bespectacled and always impeccably
dressed, had a formidable reputation for hard work.
   Louise Brown was conceived and born at no cost to her parents
under Britain's state-funded National Health Service. But after an
argument with the government Health Department about the high cost
of his work, Steptoe quit the service in 1978.
   He and Edwards set up their clinic at Bourn Hall, an 11th
century castle near Cambridge, in 1980.
   Steptoe is survived by his wife, Sheena, whom he married in
1943, and a son and daughter.

   Edd Roush, a two-time National League
batting champ for the Cincinnati Reds and a member of the Hall of
Fame, died after suffering an apparent heart attack at a ballpark
Monday. He was 94.
   Roush, who had been the oldest living member of the Hall of
Fame, was inducted into the shrine in 1962 with Jackie Robinson,
Bob Feller and the late Bill McKechnie.
   During his 18-year career, Roush had a .325 lifetime batting
average. In 1929, he batted .324 for the New York Giants, but held
out the entire 1930 season over a contract dispute. He played his
final season for the Reds in 1931 and batted .271.
   Roush, a winter resident of Bradenton for 35 years who also
lived in his hometown of Oakland City, Ind., was at the ball park
for a spring training game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the
Texas Rangers when he died.
   He began his major league career in the American League with
Chicago in 1913.
   In 1917, in his first full season with the Reds, the left-hander
led the National League with a .341 batting average. He won his
second batting title in 1919, hitting .321 for the Reds.

   Sam W. Reynolds, a businessman who was
appointed a U.S. senator and served for seven months, died Sunday
of pneumonia. He was 97.
   Reynolds owned and operated Reynolds-Updike Coal Co. for 76
years until retiring in 1984. He also was a partner in Updike
Lumber and Coal.
   Gov. Bob Crosby appointed Reynolds, a Republican, to the Senate
in 1954 after the death of Sen. Hugh Butler. Reynolds did not seek
election to a full term.
   Reynolds was a city councilman in 1956 and 1957 and had been
city civil defense coordinator. He won the Nebraska amateur golf
championship seven times.

   Former Missouri State Auditor George Lehr,
credited for helping to clean up the reputedly mob-dominated
Teamsters Union Central States pension fund, died Monday at age 51.
   Lehr, executive director of the fund for the past 6{ years, had
suffered inoperable brain tumors for more than a year.
   Lehr, a Democrat, defeated Republican John Ashcroft, now
Missouri's governor, for state auditor in 1974. Lehr was mentioned
as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1976,
but made the surprise announcement that he was resigning as auditor
and leaving politics.
   He became president of the Empire Bank and Trust Co. in Kansas
City and later became chairman and chief executive officer of
Traders Bank there.
   Lehr accepted the pension fund job in 1981 and worked with the
U.S. Labor Department to clean it up. The fund allegedly had been
under mob control. Two years ago, the General Accounting Office
said the fund was being run properly for the first time in its 30
years.

   Hester R. McCullough, once a heroine of
the political right for her 1940s stand against entertainers
associated with communist causes, died Sunday at age 71.
   In the late 1940s, Mrs. McCullough, then living in Greenwich,
Conn., returned a $6 subscription ticket to a performance by dancer
Paul Draper and harmonica player Larry Adler, whom she accused of
being members of communist-front organizations.
   Draper and Adler sued Mrs. McCullough for libel, but decided not
to pursue the case when it ended in a hung jury in 1950. By then,
it had become a cause celebre taken up by conservative columnists
such as Westbrook Pegler.

<TEXT>
   Astronomers say a vague prediction by the
16th-century astrologer Nostradamus has caused unfounded fear that
an alignment of planets will trigger an earthquake that will
destroy Los Angeles in May.
   ``There is no alignment of planets in May, and even if there
were, it wouldn't have anything to do with earthquakes,'' Edwin
Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory, said Monday.
   But rumors of an impending earthquake, spurred by writings of
the French astrologer and the movie ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,''
which is being sold on videocassette, prompted more than 100
fearful people to call the observatory in recent weeks, Krupp said.
   ``We an tell by the phone calls that many people are getting
needlessly afraid of the possibility of an earthquake,'' he said,
calling the quake predictions ``bunk.''
   Astronomer John Mosley, the observatory's program supervisor,
wrote recently: ``There are 11,000 earthquakes each year in the Los
Angeles area strong enough to be recorded. There may be a
significant earthquake in May 1988, here or elsewhere ... but if
there is, it will have nothing to do with the planets' positions.''
   Mosley said followers of Nostradamus, who lived from 1503 to
1566, have claimed he predicted such events as the Russian
Revolution, the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
   But Nostradamus' predictions, written in rhyme, ``are
exceptionally vague, and in general it is only after the fact that
a link can be made between his rhymed prediction and an historical
event,'' Mosley said.
   He said ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow'' claimed Nostradamus wrote
that an alignment of Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus and Mars will
cause a major earthquake in May in Los Angeles.
   ``The prophecy is quoted incorrectly in the movie,'' Mosley
said. ``Nostradamus predicts a severe hailstorm, not an earthquake.
... There is no clue that tells us where this hailstorm will
occur.''
   Mosley said: ``The last time the planets were supposed to align
and trigger mass destruction in Los Angeles was in 1982, the year
of the `Jupiter Effect,''' a book that claims the planets' tidal
influence causes quakes.
   ``Untold millions did not die in 1982 and there's no reason to
think that anything will happen in 1988,'' he said. Even if the
planets were aligned, ``their gravitational effect would be
completely negligible ... and they would have no effect on our
planet's weather, tides or earthquakes,'' Mosley added.

<TEXT>
   Strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
offered to resign before the May 1989 presidential election if
opponents agree to talks with his regime, but the opposition and
the United States rejected the offer.
   ``The general has to go immediately _ not eventually,'' said
Aurelio Barria, head of the National Civic Crusade, an opposition
umbrella group. ``There will be no dialogue with him.''
   Barria said the general strike, which shut down over 90 percent
of this nation's commerce on Monday, would be even more complete
today.
   Indeed, most stores in the downtown area remained shuttered
today.
   ``I say this to Noriega: Phooey,'' said one downtown Panama City
merchant guarding his closed dry goods shop.
   In Washington, the State Department also dismissed Noriega's
resignation offer as ``little more than ... a ploy'' to keep
Noriega's cronies in power and the general in control of the armed
forces.
   ``Noreiga should go, and the sooner the better for Panama,''
said State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman.
   After Noriega was indicted on U.S. drug charges, the Reagan
administration dried up the flow of money to Panama, which uses the
U.S. dollar as its currency, in an effort to force him out, and the
economy is near collapse.
   Noriega's offer to resign, announced Monday night in a national
broadcast by civilian chief of state Manuel Solis Palma, was
conditioned on a national dialogue with the opposition. But
opposition leader Guillermo Cochez of the Christian Democratic
Party said the proposed dialogue involved a hand-picked 33-member
panel that would have 22 pro-Noriega members.
   ``This is not a dialogue,'' said Cochez. ``It's just cynicism.''
   Noriega, the chief of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces and
the power behind the civilian government, left the presidential
palace after Solis Palma's speech and hailed his proposal as a
Panamanian solution, rather than one imposed by the United States.
``I have no reason to talk to the United States,'' Noriega told
reporters. ``I talk to Panamanians.''
   In his speech, Solis Palma said Noriega had given his word ``as
an officer and a gentleman'' to step down before elections
scheduled for May 1989.
   Solis Palma, elevated to chief of state when Noriega ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26, said he would accept the
general's resignation only after the dialogue.
   Opposition leaders derided the proposal.
   ``He said, `here I have a little piece of candy, and if you all
behave, I'll give it to you, okay?,' said businessman Pierre
Leignadier, a crusade member. Leignadier called the idea an insult
to the Panamanian people.
   Crusade leaders said they expected even stronger support today
for the general strike despite Noriega's offer.
   On Monday, the strike almost totally shut down the capital of
this nation of 2.5 million and, according to the crusade, outlying
cities and towns as well.
   ``The paralyzation is total in industry, finance and commerce,''
said business leader Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra.
   About half of government employees _ who were warned they would
be suspended if they went on strike _ failed to show up for work,
he said.
   The strike was called after the government decreed a state of
emergency last week allowing authorities to suspend constitutional
rights.
   Solis Palma said on Monday the Reagan administration ``says they
want a country without drug traffickers,'' but that continued U.S.
control of the Panama Canal was the real motive behind the attack
on Noriega.
   Delvalle tried to fire Noriega on Feb. 25, after two U.S. drug
trafficking indictments against Noriega were handed up in Florida.
   After Noriega orchestrated Delvalle's ouster on Feb. 26, the
United States froze Panama's international bank accounts, leaving
the government and many private businesses without cash to pay
employees.
   Retirees were told Monday they will not be paid this week. The
dockworkers union official, Gustavo Gonzalez, said Solis Palma told
union leaders in a meeting at the presidential palace Sunday the
country had no more money.
   After the government was unable to give full paychecks to
employees last week, several national police members tried and
failed to stage a military coup, and thousands of anti-Noriega
rioters took the streets.
   One man hit by an army shotgun blast during last week's violence
died Monday of his wounds, becoming the first death in the latest
wave of unrest.
   Also Monday, the Panamanian Defense Forces announced a shakeup,
kicking out 17 officers connected with the coup attempt and
promoting 98 loyal officers.

   Wedding guests looked on in horror as a
suspected getaway car being chased by police ran down a bridesmaid,
dragged her across the street and smashed into the church where the
wedding had just taken place.
   Marilyn York, 18, of Little Rock, was helping to decorate the
bride and bridgroom's car Monday when she was hit and killed,
police said.
   She had been a bridesmaid in the wedding of 21-year-old Valarie
Dodson and 20-year-old Larry Charles minutes before at Hoover
United Methodist Church.
   Police were chasing a sports car which had been reported stolen
last week when the car was driven onto a parking lot and hit the
parked car onto which the wedding party had painted the words
``Just Married.''
   The speeding car then ran over Ms. York, crossed the street and
hit a corner of the church.
   The driver of the car ran a short distance and was caught and
arrested.
   ``We were decorating the car and spraying it when we heard a
loud noise,'' said Viola Dodson, the bride's mother. ``We had our
backs turned and when we looked around, we saw him coming at us
real fast.''
   The bride's mother said she started pushing people out of the
way and managed to get out of the path of the car herself.
   Ms. York, a friend of the bride, ``got caught between his car
and my car and he drug her body across the street and slammed into
the wall,'' Mrs. Dodson said.
   The police said the Firebird was reported to have been used as a
getaway car in a shoplifting at a Little Rock store Sunday and was
seen by a police officer less than a mile from the wedding scene
Monday. The officer tried to stop the car but the driver sped away.

<HEAD>Chemical Company Recalls Gas Cylinders Nationwide In Wake of Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company that distributed a
cylinder of gas that exploded and killed three at a research
laboratory here last week began recalling hundreds of similar
cylinders nationwide, state officials said.
   Liquid Carbonics Industries Inc., a Chicago-based gas
distributor, is recalling cylinders containing the gas silane
following the blast at the Gollob Analytical Services Plant here
Thursday, said Richard Fulton, a spokesman for the state Department
of Environmental Protection.
   A spokeswoman for the company in Chicago said it was
investigating the origin of the cylinder that exploded but declined
to confirm the recall or comment further.
   The explosion was triggered by a silane cylinder that was
contaminated with nitrous oxide, a highly unstable mixture, Fulton
said.
   The blast killed three people, seriously injured a Liquid
Carbonics employee and forced the evacuation of 1,500 people living
near the plant.
   Fulton said Liquid Carbonics on Monday removed cylinders of
silane from its Harrison, N.J. storage facility. Phone calls to
Liquid Carbonics in Harrison were unanswered.
   Elsewhere, about 1,000 workers were kept from their jobs Monday
in California after canisters containing potentially explosive
chemicals were discovered at semiconductor facilities there.
   Chemical inspectors eventually concluded that four canisters at
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in Santa Clara and Teledyne
Semiconductor in Mountain View were harmless, and work was
scheduled to resume today.
   Another 150 cylinders stored at a Liquid Carbonics plant in San
Carlos where they are manufactured were expected to be examined
Tuesday, officials said. Company officials feared the canisters
might have come from the same batch as the one that blew up.
   At a Gould Inc. semiconductor plant in Pocatello, Idaho, another
possibly contaminated silane cylinder bought from Liquid Carbonics
was emptied Sunday after employees and residents of a nearby
nursing home were evacuated, said a spokesman at Gould's
headquarters in Chicago.
   New Jersey officials said Monday another potentially dangerous
cylinder of silane that prompted officials to evacuate residents
Friday night continued to burn at the Gollob plant.
   Two other potentially hazardous canisters at the site were
removed Sunday. Fulton said about 200 non-hazardous cylinders of
gas remained at the site.
   State officials have not conducted an inventory of the gutted
Gollob building and were trying to decide whether to let the
flaming cylinder burn itself out, Fulton said.
   Evacuees were allowed to return to their homes Sunday and
businesses near the Gollob plant were allowed to reopen Monday.

   A group of residents in this western Pacific
island chain have started a drive to have Palau declared a
commonwealth of the United States, citing a need for U.S. law
enforcement agencies.
   The Palau America Association wrote to President Reagan and
lawmakers Monday, informing them of a petition drive aimed at
placing a constitutional amendment on Palau's November election
ballot.
   Palau, the last Pacific territory still under U.S. trusteeship
since World War II, has entered into a compact of free association
with the United States. That measure is still awaiting
implementation in Congress.
   ``This movement is born out of a belated realization by many
Palauans that the future well-being of Palau and a majority of its
people will not be protected under a Compact of Free Association
without the presence of U.S. federal law enforcement agencies,''
said a letter from Francisco T. Uludong, who is working on the
petition drive.
   Volunteers need signatures of 25 percent of the electorate,
about 2,000 people.

   The Soviet government announced today that three
Soviet soldiers have been taken prisoner by Eritrean separatists
and another is missing in Ethiopia.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters
at a news briefing that 13 Soviet military advisers were captured
in Ethiopia last week by forces fighting to establish an Eritrean
state separate from the government of Addis Ababa.
   ``Recently the so-called People's Front for the Liberation of
Eritrea has intensified combat operations,'' Gerasimov said.
   He said nine of the Soviets captured had returned to their
command posts, three had been identified by their captors as
prisoners of war and one remained missing.
   The spokesman said the soldiers were serving as military
advisers in Ethiopia, which has strong political ties to the Soviet
Union.
   Gerasimov had no other details of the incident or the conditions
in which the Soviet captives are being held.
   Eritrea, a former Italian colony on the Red Sea, was
administered by Britain from World War II until 1952 when it was
federated with Ethiopia under a United Nations resolution. Ethiopia
incorporated it as a province in 1962, sparking a rebellion which
seeks independence.

   The United States can have ``great certainty''
that it will spot any Soviet attempts to cheat on the treaty
eliminating medium-range atomic missiles from Europe, the Senate
Intelligence Committee unanimously concluded today.
   The testimony came as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
began working on the final details of the pact after two months of
testimony on the treaty signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Foreign Relations Committee is reviewing the pact. Senate
Democratic leaders say they expect the treaty will be approved by
the full chamber next month.
   Leaders of both parties have predicted the final tally will show
88 to 90 votes for the treaty, far more than the 67 needed for
ratification.
   As part of the Senate review, the Intelligence Committee looked
at American ability to monitor Soviet compliance through a variety
of means including on-site ground inspection and satellites.
   ``The intelligence community will be able to monitor the
drawdown and elimination of declared Soviet missile launchers and
associated equipment with great certainty,'' said the report, which
was unanimously approved by the committee.
   But Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Intelligence
Committee, told the Foreign Relations Committee that more money
needs to be spent to be sure of finding Soviet attempts to cheat on
a separate treaty making deep cuts in long-range atomic weapons.
That prospective treaty is now being worked on by American and
Soviet negotiators.
   ``The interests of the United States are served by effective,
verifiable limitations on nuclear weapons,'' said Boren. ``Indeed,
such limitations must continue to be pursued vigorously long after
the issue of ratification of the (medium-range missile) treaty has
been been resolved.''
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, vice chairman of the Intelligence
Committee, warned the foreign relations panel that ``no
verification and monitoring regime can be absolutely perfect.''
   Despite the expected outcome, the pact has come under fire from
both Democrats and conservative Republicans.
   Democrats, led by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., are considering
attaching a legal condition to the treaty which provides that the
interpretation given by administration officials during treaty
hearings is binding on future administrations.
   Democratic officials were working late Monday to agree on some
type of language, but no final proposal had been approved,
according to congressional sources speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The proposal arises from the ongoing dispute between the Reagan
administration and congressional Democrats over Reagan's assertion
that he has the legal right unilaterally to change the U.S.
interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   That change would allow some tests of Reagan's Star Wars
anti-missile defense system, but congressional Democrats have
argued that any alteration in how a treaty is interpreted should
first be approved by the Senate.
   The White House told congressional Democrats last week it
opposed the Democratic-backed effort to attach a condition to the
treaty because the condition would require the executive branch to
adhere to every statement made by administration officials during
the hearings, ``no matter how trivial.''
   The conservative opposition is led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.
   Helms has claimed that the administration made
``misrepresentations'' about the effect of the treaty, a charge
that was flatly denied by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Shultz, who was both the first and last administration witness
to testify to the Foreign Relations panel, said the treaty ``stands
on its merits'' and ``should not be made a vehicle for statements
on other issues.''
   Shultz and other administration officials have consistently
urged the Senate to avoid so-called ``killer amendments'' that
could force a reopening of negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   Administration officials have also argued that rejection of the
treaty would be a deep blow to U.S. prestige and power in the
16-member NATO alliance.
   One condition which will be opposed is being offered by Sen.
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   The amendment will require Reagan to ``reaffirm to the Soviet
Union the importance Americans place on human rights and
fundamental freedoms in the achievement of lasting peace among
nations.''

   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem cleric called
today for extremists to kidnap more Americans because, he claimed,
the United States was responsible for the problems in the Middle
East.
   ``America is the cause of all our calamities,'' Sheik Subhi
Tufaili was quoted as saying in a published interview. ``The
Moslems should chase America's symbols everywhere.''
   Tufaili, a senior leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, was quoted as urging his followers to ``hold
(hostage) all the American regime.''
   Meanwhile, Lebanon's highest ranking Shiite cleric, Sheik
Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddine, said he believed that the kidnapping of
foreigners for political motives ``has reached its end.''
   ``We are inclined to believe that this course of political
action has reached an end,'' Shamseddine told the Lebanese News
Agency, an Arabic-language newsletter. He did not elaborate.
   Shamseddine said he has never approved of kidnappings.
   His remark reflects differences within Lebanon's Shiite
community over the abduction of foreigners.
   Tufaili made his remarks in an interview published by the
Hezbollah-financed weekly magazine Al-Wihda Al-Islamiah, or Islamic
Unity.
   Hezbollah, made up of Shiites loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, is believed to be an umbrella organization for
underground groups holding most of the nine Americans missing in
Lebanon.
   Tufaili also charged that the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon was an ``umbrella for many of America's and the West's
spies.''
   The nine-nation 5,800-strong UNIFIL has been deployed in south
Lebanon since March 19, 1978.
   U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, chief of the 76-member
Observer Group-Lebanon attached to UNIFIL, was kidnapped near the
southern Lebanese port city of Tyre on Feb. 17.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, believed
to be a Hezbollah-affiliated group, claimed Higgins' abduction and
claimed he was a spy. U.S. and UNIFIL officials denied the charge.
   In addition to the nine Americans, 13 foreigners are missing
after being kidnapped in Lebanon. They are four Frenchmen, three
Britons, one West German, one Italian, one Irishman, one Indian and
two unidentified foreign men.
   Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East Correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Although officials aboard the ship were aware of the charge,
McCall was not taken into custody until the vessel docked.
   ``He couldn't go anywhere,'' said Hills.

   A Protestant who allegedly
killed three Roman Catholics in a gun and grenade attack at an
Irish Republican Army funeral last week will be charged with six
counts of murder, police said today.
   Michael Stone, 33, has been in custody since last Wednesday when
mourners grabbed and beat him as he fled the funeral in Milltown,
firing and hurling grenades.
   Police gave no immediate details of the three other murder
charges against Stone. But police sources have said Stone was also
suspected of being connected with other killings of Catholics in
recent years.
   Meanwhile, the Catholic ghettos of West Belfast braced for a
wave of arrests in the hunt for the killers of two British soldiers
at an IRA funeral Saturday. A crowd, some of whom apparently feared
another Protestant attack, beat and stripped the soldiers who were
then shot dead by IRA gunmen.
   Police sources said up to 30 people may be arrested.
   Earlier today, British troops discoverd and detonated a homemade
bomb outside an apartment building on the outskirts of West Belfast.
   And police reported finding two rifles, grenades and a pistol in
Londonderry's Catholic Shantallow district, the fourth cache found
in the city this week.
   In Londonderry, police sought the men who killed policeman Clive
Graham at a Londonderry police checkpoint Monday. Graham was the
12th victim in two weeks of tension and sectarian violence in
northern Ireland.
   Police Chief Supt. David Turkington said ``someone must have
seen'' the gunmen who held a family hostage, fired on Graham from a
row house and escaped in a hijacked car.
   Britain's two TV networks, the British Broadcasting Corp. and
Independent Television News, said Monday they have refused police
demands to hand over untransmitted film of last Wednesday's funeral
rampage on grounds this would endanger their crews in the future.
   ``This policy is to protect our film crews, to protect the lives
of our staff,'' said a BBC spokeswoman, who declined to be
identified.
   Addressing the House of Commons in London on Monday, Northern
Ireland Secretary Tom King said, ``A massive murder investigation
is under way in which all possible resources are involved to
identify all those responsible.''
   He also announced an immediate review of a policy of not
policing IRA funerals.
   Police introduced the no-policing policy at last Wednesday's
funeral for the three IRA guerrillas killed in Gibraltar under
pressure from Catholic leaders who feared clashes between police
and mourners.
   The latest wave of tension and violence began March 6, when
British commandos shot and killed three unarmed IRA guerrillas in
Gibraltar while they were allegedly planning a bombing attack in
the British colony.
   Stone allegedly killed three people and injured 68 in
Wednesday's funeral in Milltown for the three IRA members.
   At Saturday's funeral for an IRA man killed in the Milltown
attack, IRA gunmen killed two British soldiers, who were in
civilian clothes at the time.
   Asked why police did not immediately order in heavily armed
units on standby nearby, King said it was not clear at first to
police commanders watching the army video that soldiers were being
attacked. He said the authorities believed no security force
personnel were in the area.
   ``The truth is that there will be new depths (of horror) again
as long as this awful and evil campaign of terrorism and revenge
continues,'' King told the Commons on Monday. ``It has got to
stop.''
   There were new calls for another attempt to find agreement
between the province's mainstream Catholic and Protestant political
parties to stop guerrilla groups.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the moderate Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, said Britain must decide ``whether the
priority is to defeat the IRA, or to find a political solution.''
   At least 2,638 people have died in sectarian violence in Norther
Northern Ireland since 1969. The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to
end British rule and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the Catholic Republic of Ireland under a leftist administration.

   Residents of the Northeast dug out winter overcoats and ski
jackets as unseasonable cold gripped the region today, three days
into spring.
   Temperatures were generally below freezing, with readings in the
teens and single digits over much of the Great Lakes region and
northern Atlantic Coast. Subzero readings were reported at a few
locations in Maine, New York and Pennsylvania.
   ``Somebody left the door open on the north side of the house,''
said Bob Thomas, a forecaster for the National Weather Service in
Albany, N.Y. ``We're getting a strong cold wind right out of
Hudson's Bay.''
   Spring has been in disguise since it began Sunday; the 21-degree
high in Albany on Monday was about 20 degrees below normal.
   ``Some of the early blooming flowers may be negatively affected.
Some of the crocuses may not fare too well,'' said George Good, a
horticulturalist in Ithaca, N.Y.
   However, many flowers may not have poked their shoots out of the
ground yet, Good said. ``For the most part there hasn't been enough
warm weather yet to really get things started.''
   Ten Northeastern cities reported records this morning, including
Allentown, Pa., where the 15 degree low tied the record set in
1965; Mansfield, Ohio, where the 14-degree mark shaved a degree off
the 1965 record; and Syracuse, N.Y., where the 5 degrees cut three
degrees off a record set in 1959.
   A reading of 7 degrees shortly after midnight set a record in
Binghamton, N.Y. The old record low for the date was 8 degrees in
1965.
   Bradford, Pa., was the coldest place in the nation at 2 a.m.
EST, at zero degrees, and it was 18 degrees at 5:30 a.m. in New
York City. Ohio residents looked out on a Lake Erie that was still
mostly ice-covered.
   However, a warming trend was expected to put winter to flight
this afternoon and Wednesday, with temperatures rising into the 40s
and 50s in the mid-Atlantic region.
   Steve Smith, a weather specialist for Environment Canada at
Churchill, Manitoba, on the shores of Hudson's Bay, disavowed
responsibility for the cold.
   Smith said a high-pressure system was driving the cold air from
the north. ``That's why you're getting our weather. So you really
can't blame us,'' he said.
   ``They call us the polar bear capital of the world. While you're
getting our weather, we've got a south wind that's pushing our
temperatures above normal,'' Smith said.
   In Churchill, the high Monday was 10 degrees, seven degrees
above normal. The low was minus 15.

   An Iranian gunboat and helicopter
attacked a Norwegian-operated tanker carrying volatile chemicals
through the Persian Gulf at dawn today. A Greek supertanker later
was reported set ablaze in another Iranian raid.
   Two crewmen were killed and four wounded in the first attack, on
the 38,534-ton Havglimt, flying the Singapore flag, shipping
executives reported.
   Iraq fired a missile at Tehran today and mounted air raids on
seven other cities, the Iraqi News Agency reported. The missile was
the 45th aimed at the Iranian capital since the Iran-Iraq ``war of
cities'' resumed March 13.
   Shipping executives said an unidentified U.S. warship patrolling
the gulf picked up 10 seamen, who were floating in a raft after
abandoning the Greek supertanker, the 357,130-ton Stavros G.L.
   The executives said the other 19 Greek crewmen stayed on board
to fight the flames. A salvage tugboat soon joined the effort.
   There were no casualties aboard the Greek vessel, which was
attacked about 1 p.m. only a few miles south of where the Havglimt
was hit in a dawn attack.
   The attacks were the seventh and eighth by Iran on neutral
shipping since Friday. They came as 51 crewmen remained missing and
were presumed dead after an Iraqi raid on two tankers near Iran's
Kharg island oil terminal. Earlier reports had said 54 crewmen were
missing.
   The escalation of the ``tanker war'' came as Iran and Iraq were
locked in a series of missile duels and air raids on each other's
major cities. The two nations have been at war for 7{ years.
   Today's missile attack on Tehran was the 106th such attack since
Feb. 29.
   About 65 Iranian missiles have slammed into Baghdad in that
time. Also Monday, Iran launched an artillery and rocket attack on
Basra, inflicting heavy casualties, Iraq said.
   The Havglimt tanker, carrying ammonia and operated by the
Oslo-based Havtor Co., was hit at dawn about 12 miles northwest of
Dubai, said the gulf-based shipping executives, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The dead crewmen were identified as Singapore nationals, and the
ship's Norwegian captain was among the wounded. Other members of
the 26-man, multinational crew were mainly treated for inhalation
of ammonia vapors, according to the executives. Four needed
hospitalization.
   The fire in the engine room of the stricken tanker was brought
under control by salvage tugboats, but the flames later reignited
in the crew's quarters, the executives said.
   The British destroyer HMS Exeter, on patrol in the area,
dispatched a helicopter to help rescue the crew, many of whom had
fainted from fumes leaking from blasted cargo holds, the shipping
sources said.
   A navy medical team wore gas masks as they were lowered from the
helicopter onto the tanker to help airlift the seamen.
   The bodies of the dead and the injured crew members were lowered
onto a salvage tugboat, which took them to a hospital at the United
Arab Emirates port of Dubai, the sources said.
   The shipping executive said at least one gunboat raided the
vessel with machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades. Forty
minutes later, a helicopter fired rockets at the tanker.
   ``They went for the accommodation quarters. There were plenty,
plenty of hits all over,'' said Associated Press photographer Greg
English, who flew over the stricken tanker in a helicopter.
   Iraq resumed attacks on Iranian oil shipping lanes on March 8,
after a lull in attacks in the Persian Gulf for about a month.
   On Monday, Iranian gunboats attacked and set ablaze the
10,168-ton Spanish refrigerator ship Iberian Reefer and the
61,762-ton Liberian-registered Fumi with rocket grenades. No
casualties were reported on board either ship.
   At least 51 crewmen remained missing from Iraq's Saturday attack
near Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal. The attack destroyed two
Iranian-owned ships, the 253,837-ton Sanandaj and the 316,379-ton
Avaj.
   The Norwegian Shipping Association reported today that the
number of missing was ``imprecise,'' but the latest figure was 51.
   Earlier, Norwegian officials had said 54 crewmen, mostly
Iranians and Asians, were presumed dead. A Swedish engineer also
was among the missing.
   The Shipping Association said it had no independent confirmation
of the deaths and was working on the basis of gulf sources.
   Both ships were owned by the Iran's National Iranian Tanker Co.,
but the Sanandaj crew was hired by a Norwegian firm, Viking
Engineering, and another Norwegian company, Scanact, had part
interest in the Avaj.
   The maritime insurance firm, Lloyd's of London, said 37 ships
had been damaged in attacks by both Iraq and Iran this year.

<HEAD>Resolution On Religion And Politics Tabled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Delegates to the American Jewish Congress
convention voiced concern today about the role of religious groups
in politics but tabled a resolution urging churches and synagogues
to refrain from active roles in political campaigns.
   The proposed resolution, which will be redrafted, had suggested
it was ``inherently dangerous'' for religious groups to identify
with one candidate or one political party. It reaffirmed the right
of all people, including clergy, to seek political office.
   The resolution is expected to be taken up at a later national
meeting of the group, but leaders did not indicate whether it would
be during the 1988 presidential campaign.
   Discussion centered on whether delegates should take a strong
stand against practices by two religious leaders now running for
president, Pat Robertson and Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   The tabled resolution said ``certain recent practices of both
these candidates are troubling issues,'' citing Robertson's use of
church-owned buses to bring supporters to caucuses and Jackson's
effort during the Super Tuesday primaries to collect contributions
in churches.
   In their nearly unanimous decision to redraft the resolution,
delegates said it could be counterproductive and also should not
refer to any individual.
   On Monday night, an AJC leader urged that a new world Zionist
meeting be convened in Jerusalem in the 1990s to unify Jews
everywhere with Israelis and to heal the division over how to
achieve peace with the Arabs.
   ``We are indeed one people, sharing one destiny, no matter where
we live,'' executive director Henry Siegman told delegates at the
70th anniversary convention.
   Siegman reiterated the AJC's support for a U.S. plan calling for
talks on Palestinian autonomy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, followed by an international peace conference including
Israel and its Arab neighbors. He also spoke out against Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's condemnation of Jews who object to
his opposition to the plan.
   ``The Jewish people everywhere, and not only those who vote in
support of a particular Israeli party, have a right to speak up
when they believe certain policies profoundly violate a legacy that
belongs to the Jewish people collectively, even if finally only the
citizens of Israel will vote and make those decisions on which
their security depends,'' Siegman said.

   One moment, DeAndra Anrig was
peacefully flying her kite. The next, she too was soaring through
the air, courtesy of a passing plane which snagged the kite string.
   ``I'm very sore _ and I was very scared,'' said the 8-year-old
Dublin, Calif., youngster after spending Monday at home on an air
mattress, surrounded by ice packs. ``I want to go kite flying
again, but where there are no airplanes.''
   On Sunday, DeAndra and her father, Brad, were flying the kite at
Shoreline Park, using strong 200-pound test line. Suddenly, a plane
taking a patient to nearby Stanford University Hospital snagged the
kite and jerked her off the ground.
   She flew about 200 feet, about 10 feet off the ground, until she
let go to avoid hitting a tree. She was bumped and bruised, but
otherwise uninjured.
   Pilot Jake Uranga, of Reno, Nev., and his passenger also were
uninjured and the plane landed safely at Palo Alto airport nearby.
   The plane suffered $10,000 in damage and the park has banned
kite flying until an investigation is complete.
   ``She said it was just a big jerk that lifted her into the
air,'' said DeAndra's mother, Debby. ``It carried her right over my
husband's head. All he saw was a shadow going over his head.
   ``I'm just thankful she let go.''

   The head of the Public Health Service said
today he is pleased with new guidelines prohibiting discrimination
against federal employees with the AIDS virus.
   ``We worked very closely with the Office of Personnel Managment
in developing them,'' said Dr. Robert Windom, the No. 2 official of
the Department of Health and Human Services and head of the health
service.
   ``The regulations are reasonable and reflect PHS concerns,''
Windom said.
   He and other health service officials will brief personnel
officers from about 30 federal agencies on the guidelines on
Thursday.
   The rules, which will allow federal supervisors to take
disciplinary action against employees who refuse to work with
colleagues carrying the virus, were distributed to federal agencies
this week.
   ``The federal government, as an enlightened and compassionate
employer concerned with the health and welfare of its employees,
has an obligation to show the way in addressing the realities of
the AIDS epidemic,'' Constance Horner, the director of the Office
of Personnel Management, said in a memo accompanying the guidelines.
   The guidelines instruct federal agencies to treat AIDS-infected
employees ``in the same manner as employees who suffer from other
serious illnesses.'' They also say there is ``no medical basis for
employees refusing to work with such fellow employees or agency
clients.'
   If an employee's threat or refusal to work with an AIDS-infected
co-worker disrupts office functions, managers are told to
``consider appropriate corrective or disciplinary action against
the threatening or disruptive employees.''
   Horner said agencies should grant leave to AIDS-infected
employees ``in the same manner as they would for other emloyees
with medical conditions.'' AIDS-infected employees may continue
their life insurance, but cannot increase their coverage after they
become seriously ill, the guidelines state.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.

<HEAD>Judge: Panamanian Strongman's Attorney May File Position On
Indictment</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled today that Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's attorney can formally protest the legality of
racketeering and drug trafficking charges, even though the
Panmanian strongman has not appeared in court to answer the
indictment.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler granted permission for
Noriega's attorney, Neal Sonnett, to file a ``limited appearance''
on behalf of the embattled strongman.
   ``This limited appearance would be solely for the purpose of
attacking the legality and sufficiency of the indictment,'' said
Sonnett, among a battery of Miami attorneys retained by Noriega.
   The decision came over vehement objections from Assistant U.S.
Attorney Richard Gregorie, who said that Noriega's attorney could
not make any arguments until Noriega responds legally to the U.S.
indictment by making an appearance.
   Gregorie noted that Noriega had not surrendered nor made any
court appearance to answer charges in the sealed indictment
returned by a federal grand jury in Miami Feb. 4, which named
Noriega and 15 other people.
   Gregorie and Sonnett were involved in a heated exchange during
the hearing in Hoeveler's courtroom.
   ``I represent General Noriega,'' Sonnett told the judge.
   ``The government objects. He has no client to represent!''
responded Gregorie.
   ``I have a client and Mr. Gregorie knows that I have a client,''
Sonnett shot back, to which Gregorie responded, ``Then bring him
here!''
   Hoeveler agreed to let Sonnett file by Friday a memorandum of
law setting forth his position. He gave Gregorie until the
following Friday to respond.
   ``You may file your motion; then we'll decide whether you can
argue it,'' Hoeveler told Sonnett.
   Only one of the 16 defendants named in the indictment, Brian
Alden Davidow, was at today's hearing.
   Davidow, 26, the only person to surrender in the case thus far
and be arraigned, has pleaded innocent to the racketeering
conspiracy count and other charges in the indictment. He is free on
$500,000 bond after his family posted 10 percent of that amount
with the court.
   Hoeveler delayed setting a trial date after Davidow made a
formal waiver of his right to a speedy trial.
   Most of the other defendants named in the indictment were in
either Panama or Colombia, Gregorie said.

<HEAD>Anglican Bishops Pledge Backing For Tutu In Showdown With Botha</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican bishops, including an
envoy sent by the Archbishop of Canterbury, today pledged support
for Archbishop Desmond Tutu in his confrontation with the
government.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican church in southern
Africa, has angered President P.W. Botha by declaring that he and
other church leaders will carry on the work of anti-apartheid
groups which last month were banned from operating.
   Nineteen bishops, after an emergency meeting with Tutu, issued a
statement warning that the government ``is driving this beloved
country closer to civil war.''
   ``We offer Archbishop Tutu our loyalty and support,'' the
bishops said. ``We shall not allow the government to isolate him.''
   Tutu, who declared that the government would ``bite the dust,''
said it was important that Botha and other white South Africans
``know that I am not just spouting forth things that come into my
head.''
   ``These are responsible people,'' said Tutu, gesturing to the
bishops. ``They would have knocked me down if they believed that
what I am saying is inconsistent with the gospel.''
   Botha met with Tutu, the winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize,
last week and suggested that the archbishop had aligned himself
with the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Referring to this, the bishops said they ``take grave offense at
the cavalier way'' in which Botha treated Tutu.
   Among those attending today's meeting was Bishop Keith Sutton of
Lichfield, England, who was sent as representative of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.
   Runcie is spiritual leader of the 70-million-member worldwide
Anglican communion.
   ``He is a Christian leader,'' Sutton said of Tutu. ``His
objections to apartheid grow directly out of his pastoral work.''
   At a news conference Monday, Tutu dared Botha to take action
against him.
   ``If they try to restrict me or ban me, they are just wasting
their time, because I will not obey their orders,'' Tutu said.
``They will have to put me in jail.''
   ``I can't keep looking over my shoulder to see if God has got
the approval or disapproval of the government,'' he added.
   Three weeks ago, Tutu and 24 other church leaders were arrested
and briefly detained after they tried to march to Parliament in
Cape Town with a petition protesting the latest crackdown on
opposition.
   Last month, the government banned 17 other organizations from
participating in any activity not approved by the government.
   Since then Tutu and other church representatives have taken up
the struggle against apartheid, which by law and custom establishes
a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have
no vote in national affairs.
   South Africa's 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   President Reagan said today he still hopes
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega will relinquish power
and leave the country.
   But Reagan would not say whether he expects Noriega to do that.
   Asked by reporters if he would be satisfied should Noriega step
down but not leave his Central American country, Reagan said, ``We
feel Noriega should leave Panama.''
   Reagan, questioned as he arrived at the Capitol for talks on the
possibility of resuming U.S. aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua,
was asked if he expected Noriega to agree to leave his nation.
   ``I'm not making any predictions,'' the president replied.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said that the
Panamanian people clearly have not been deceived by Noriega's
conditional offer to step down by May 1989.
   Redman said Panamanians regard the offer as a ``ploy to buy
time,'' a view shared by the United States.
   ``The message from Panamanians is clear. For the good of Panama,
Noriega should leave,'' Redman said.
   ``His presence is the root cause of continued political and
economic instability,'' Redman added. ``The ongoing general strike
is only the most recent demonstration of the overwhelming
opposition from all segments of Panamanian society to Noriega's
continued rule.''
   On Monday, shortly after Panama's chief of state, Manuel Solis
Palma, told Panamanians of Noriega's offer, State Department press
officer Anita Stockman said, ``We stand by our previous view that
Noriega should go, and the sooner the better for Panama.''
   Solis Palma said Noriega had given his word ``as an officer and
a gentleman'' to step down before Panamanian elections scheduled
for May 1989 if his conditions _ which include talks with
opposition leaders _ are met.
   William G. Walker, deputy assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, said Noriega's offer ``totally ignores the
reality of the situation.''
   ``Almost everyone in Panama wants him out tomorrow and wants him
out of the country,'' said Walker, who was in Panama last week to
discusss terms under which Noriega might step down.
   A State Department statement released by Stockman said:
   ``We believe the offer is little more than one, a ploy to
attempt to legitimize the illegal Solis Palma regime by calling for
negotiations between it and opposition groups and two, an effort on
the part of Noriega to maintain direct or indirect control of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.''
   Noriega is under indictment on federal drug charges in Florida.
The United States has dried up the flow of money to Panama, which
uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, in the effort to force him
out, and the economy is near collapse.
   ``Noriega is the problem, and his preoccupation with remaining
on the scene despite overwhelming domestic opposition will only
insure continued economic and political instability there,'' the
State Department said.
   Noriega put down a coup attempt by dissident officers last week
and rejected a U.S. plan for him to leave Panama and live in Spain.
   Solis Palma replaced Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was dismissed by
the legislature after he tried to fire Noriega. Delvalle, who is
hiding in Panama, is still recognized by the United States as
Panama's president.

been surrounded by people protesting his activities on behalf of
human rights, and he appears to be under house arrest, a newspaper
said today.
   Bofill, president of the Pro Human Rights Committee of Cuba, was
forced back into his house when he tried to leave, said Jerry
Scott, press attache of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, told
the Spanish-language edition of The Miami Herald on Monday.
   ``The mobs have been organized by the (Cuban) government,'' said
Hilda Felipe, a delegate of the Cuban committee who does not live
in Cuba. ``They have followed him, insulted him on the bus and the
mobs in front of his home have thrown rocks at him.''
   A diplomatic source who asked not to be identified told El Nuevo
Herald that the Cuban government wanted to destroy Bofill's image
and put him in prison before a scheduled United Nations Human
Rights Commission visit to Cuba.
   Since last week Granma, the official newspaper of Cuba's
Communist Party, has published a series of articles criticizing
Bofill.
   Ms. Felipe said she had been assured by contacts in Cuba that
the protest against Bofill was not supported by the community at
large but backed solely by the government.
   The U.S. Interests Section in Havana operates out of the Swiss
embassy because the United States and Cuba don't have diplomatic
relations.

   The government said Tuesday that 12 men
_ including an opposition party leader _ have been arrested in a
plot to overthrow the government of President Samuel Doe.
   Seven coup plotters were still at large, including an army
captain and two sergeants, said Information Minister Emmanuel
Bowier.
   Among those arrested in the plot, which was uncovered March 16,
were Gabriel Kpolleh, leader of the opposition Liberia Unification
Party, Bowier said. Four of those arrested were soldiers.
   Arms, ammunition and military uniforms were found in a Monrovia
neighborhood, he added.
   Doe has been the target of several assassination and coup
attempts. An abortive Nov. 12, 1985 coup attempt, which came after
elections that opposition leaders said were rigged, left more than
600 people dead.

   Police on Tuesday said they authenticated
a statement from a left-wing terrorist group claiming responsiblity
for a weekend bar bombing that injured 13 people, including four
U.S. servicemen and two Britons.
   The statement sent by the Revolutionary Popular Solidarity
organization to the left-wing daily Eleftherotypia is similar to
one the group sent five years ago claiming responsibility for an
abortive attack against the Saudi Arabian envoy in Greece, a police
spokesman said.
   The four non-commissioned U.S. officers who were injured in
Saturday's bomb attack at the seaside bar in the suburb of Glyfada
all serve at nearby Hellenikon U.S. Air Force Base.
   The group's statement said it would continue its attacks
``against the North American imperialists'' until the four U.S.
military bases in Greece are shut down.

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday approved a
government plan to raise the speed limit on the nation's highways
from 62 mph to 74 mph.
   The vote ended several years of debate by environmentalists,
pro-auto lobbying groups and the government, which conceded the old
speed limit was widely ignored.
   The decision, scheduled to go into effect May 1, marked the
demise of a measure that followed the 1973 Arab oil embargo against
the Netherlands.
   The new speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour had been
vigorously opposed by vocal environmentalist groups, which said it
would further damage the fragile environment in this crowded nation
of 14.6 million people. The groups, backed by left-wing political
parties, faced a powerful lobby of road builders, garage owners and
other car-related interests.
   The old speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour remains in force
along the highway in the densely populated urban crescent
stretching from Rotterdam via The Hague and Amsterdam to Utrecht in
the central Netherlands.

   The last two years have been the warmest in
this country in more than three decades, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration reported Tuesday.
   Both 1986 and 1987 recorded average temperatures for the year of
54.0 degres Fahrenheit over the 48 contiguous states, the agency
said.
   These were the warmest years since 1953, which averaged 54.7 to
tie with 1934 for the warmest year in this century.
   By contrast, records going back to 1895 show the normal annual
average temperature for the 48 states is 52.5 degrees. The coldest
year was 1917, which averaged 50.7.
   Tom Karl of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville,
N.C., said the combination of the position of the jet stream upper
air currents and the high pressure center located over Bermuda were
contributing factors in the recent warm years.
   ``The more basic thing is why they were in those positions, and
that's more difficult to answer,'' Karl said.
   ``The concern everyone has in the back of their mind is if it's
part of the greenhouse gas effect'' that has been reported on, he
said.
   The greenhouse effect is a prediction of computer models, which
say increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases in the
atmosphere could act much like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping
heat and raising the temperature of the Earth.
   ``It's not clear yet,'' if that is a factor in the warmth of
1986 and 1987, ``but it bears watching,'' Karl said.
   Until 1986 the average temperature of the United States had been
running at or slightly below normal in the 1980s, Karl said, even
though worldwide temperatures seemed to be on the increase.
   In 1986, he said, the spring was particularly warm across the
country. The winter of 1986-87 and the spring of 1987 also were
unusually warm, particularly in the north-central region.

<HEAD>Spain's Strong Latin Ties Lead To Asylum Offers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN LINNEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The offer of asylum to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega of Panama maintains a Spanish tradition of opening its
doors to Latin Americans seeking a place of exile.
   The hospitality stems from historic and cultural ties with Latin
America that transcend Spanish party politics. But the Spain that
is prepared to offer asylum to Noriega is far different from the
country that took in ousted Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in
1959.
   During the 36-year rule of Gen. Francisco Franco, Spain became a
haven for Batista, Colombian ruler Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, ousted
Argentine leader Juan D. Peron, toppled Dominican President Juan
Bosch and Venezuelan strongman Marcos Perez Jimenez.
   Rojas Pinilla arrived in 1957 after a stopover in Bermuda,
Batista spent time in Madeira and Lisbon before settling in Madrid
and Peron wandered from Paraguay to Panama to Venezuela after his
1955 ouster before arriving in Seville in 1960.
   Both Perez Jimenez, ousted in 1958, and Bosch, a democratically
elected president toppled in 1963, lived in the United States
before coming to Spain.
   Franco's conditions for receiving all were simple: maintain a
low profile and don't meddle in Spanish or foreign politics.
   In the case of Noriega, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez says
Spanish policy is to accept requests when asylum could help
maintain or restore democracy in a specific country.
   As conditions for accepting Noriega, Spain requires that he
himself ask for asylum, that the United States agree not to seek
his extradition on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges
filed against him in U.S. federal courts, and that Washington honor
the 1977 treaty under which control of the Panama Canal will revert
to Panama in 2000.
   Noriega has refused to leave Panama. But he has said he is
willing to step down as military leader prior to the 1989
presidential elections in Panama.
   Santiago Varela Diaz, a Gonzalez spokesman, said since Spain's
transition to democratic government in 1977, the type of political
exile in Spain has changed considerably.
   ``Since then, Spain has taken in many Chileans, Argentines and
Uruguayans fleeing from military dictatorships,'' he said. ``The
case of Panama and Noriega is separate, but it is a concrete
example of our willingness to serve as a support for a democratic
solution to a problem.''
   During the waning years of the Franco regime in the early 1970s,
not all the Latin American exiles in Spain were rightist dictators.
   Former Economics Minister Manuel Ulloa of Peru came to Spain
after the army ousted President Fernando Belaunde Terry in 1968.
Belaunde went to the United States.
   Christian Democratic leader Andres Zaldivar of Chile moved to
Madrid after Gen. Agusto Pinochet overthrew President Salvador
Allende in 1973.
   Most of the Latin American leaders exiled in Spain have lived in
the opulent suburbs north of Madrid.
   Batista died in Madrid of a heart attack in 1973. Perez Jimenez,
74, still lives in a palatial residence in La Moraleja.
   Until his return to Argentina after an 18-year exile, Peron held
court at his 17th of October estate in Puerta de Hierro.
   Franco laid down the law to Peron four years after his arrival
when the Argentine general tried an unsuccessful return to Buenos
Aires in 1964 and threatened him with explusion if he kept up his
politicking.
   But by 1970 Peron was again receiving a steady stream of
visitors and plotting his return to Argentina where he was elected
president in 1973. He died a year later.
   His widow, Maria Estela Martinez de Peron, who succeeded her
husband as the first woman head of state in the Western hemisphere,
lives in quiet exile in Madrid after her overthrow by the military
in 1976 and five years of house arrest in southern Argentina.

<HEAD>Parole Examiners Recommend Bosch Release In May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal parole examiners recommended today that
anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch be released from prison May 16
after completing a three-month sentence for violating his parole.
   Bosch, convicted in the United States of conspiring to bomb
foreign freighters and firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a
Polish freighter docked in Miami, served four years of his 10-year
federal prison sentence.
   He has acknowledged violating parole when he fled to South
America in 1974. He served 11 years in Venezuelan jails until his
final acquittal on charges of bombing a Cuban jetliner in which 73
died in 1976.
   The recommended sentence, which includes time Bosch has spent in
jail since returning to the United States, must be approved by the
U.S. Parole Commission. The panel is expected to decide within
three weeks.
   But after serving his three-month sentence, the 61-year-old
Bosch will likely be taken into custody by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said Bosch's attorney, George Yoss. The INS
has targeted Bosch for exclusion hearings and possible deportation.
   Bosch entered the United States illegally last month after his
release from a Venezuelan prison. Since mid-February, he has been
detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in South Dade.
   Bosch hugged his family after learning the examiners'
recommendation, said his daughter, Myriam Bosch. ``We're very
satisfied with the recommendation,'' she said. ``We think it's very
fair.''
   Yoss said Bosch probably would not appeal the recommended
sentence for his 1974 parole violation. ``It's something Dr. Bosch,
the family and we can all live with,'' Yoss said.
   Several prominent Cuban-Americans, including Jorge Mas Canosa,
head of the Cuban American National Foundation, testified today
before the parole examiners in a hearing closed to the public
because it is an administrative procedure, federal officials said.
   Mas Canosa said Bosch should be released because he has learned
his lesson and would now work peacefully for the overthrow of Cuban
President Fidel Castro.

<TEXT>
   General Electric is recalling about 45,000 GE
and RCA brand electric surge suppressors which could present a
shock hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday.
   Known as Electronic Protection Center surge suppressors, the
units were sold nationally between October 1986 and December 1987,
officials said.
   No injuries have been reported, but officials said a defect in
some of the units could allow their metal housings and the metal
housings of any connected appliances to become electrified,
creating the potential for a shock.
   Involved are GE surge suppressor models EPC-6S, EPC-6MS, EPC-4NS
and EPC-CPU as well as RCA models SK416 and SKF416.
   The items sold for $40 to $60. They resemble a gray power strip
with four or six electrical outlets. Each has an on-off switch, a
power indicator light, resettable circuit breaker and 6-foot cord.
The product was designed to prevent damage from sudden electrical
power surges to such equipment as personal computers, stereos,
televisions and other appliances.
   Owners of the units should disconnect them from the outlet,
without touching the metal housing, and mail them to General
Electric Co., Attn: EPC Recall, P.O. Box 8203, Beaverton, Ore.,
97076. The units will be replaced and postage costs reimbursed.
   Anyone needing more information may contact GE at 1-800-626-2000
or the safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<HEAD>Gore Talks Populism But His Eyes Light Up on Technical Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. stood in front of one
of the most powerful computers ever built and for half an hour
spoke with the kind of emotion not often seen in the 1988
presidential race.
   He complained of the Reagan administration's ``starvation of
super-computing,'' and described his vision _ a nationwide
fiber-optic network connecting such machines for research and
business, a public works project as important as the building of
interstate highways a generation ago.
   When he was done, a television reporter's first question made
Gore's face sag. What, the newsman wanted to know, did the
Tennessee senator think of the latest polls that showed him
trailing in the presidential race.
   Gore managed a chuckle and, after a pause, gave the answer he
had repeated three times before in three other cities that day:
Polls are sometimes wrong.
   But Gore had come to the campus of the University of Illinois in
Champaign, one day before Illinois' important Democratic
presidential primary last week, to talk super-computers _ the kind
that perform millions of calculations in an instant, and whose
usefulness is more widely assumed than understood.
   Gore's performance, and the staging and timing of the event,
illustrate the incongruity that sometimes surfaces as he takes his
campaign to the North.
   He uses newly adopted slogans about ``working men and women,''
and of bringing the Democratic Party ``back to the grass roots'' _
populism that proved successful in the South.
   Yet Gore often seems more inspired when the discussion turns to
deeply technical issues of the sort that may not evoke much
response from those working men and women he seeks.
   ``Super-computing will be the engine of the information age,''
Gore said.
   He and his audience were crowded into an antiseptic,
white-floored and glass-walled room with a Cray super-computer the
size of two or three Coca-Cola machines and about as red. With him
were his wife and his father.
   ``What we have seen in the last several years is the emergence
of an entirely new field of scientific inquiry _ computational
science,'' Gore said. ``It's time we move forward to create a
national infrastructure that enables us to take advantage of that
computational science.''
   Gore, 39, was educated at Harvard, showing an intellectual
curiosity that led him to enroll in both the divinity and law
schools, finishing neither.
   In 12 years as a member of the House and Senate, he immersed
himself in issues such as medical technology, organ transplants and
arms control.
   He gained the reputation of an arms-control specialist who
enjoys detail. On his campaign plane he talks with excitement of
``unmistakeable signs,'' in Warsaw Pact troop placements of recent
weeks, that the Soviets' ``basic posture is undergoing
re-evaluation.''
   But his claimed expertise can be a two-edged sword. Rival
Michael Dukakis charged Gore ``got taken to the cleaners'' when he
led Democratic negotiations with the Reagan administration over
arms control and Star Wars.
   There's also the possible problem of bogging down his audience _
in what is, after all, a political battle _ with detail on
technical subjects.
   For example, there was his campaign statement last week reacting
to reports that ozone _ a protective layer of atmosphere shielding
out harmful rays _ was disappearing faster than thought.
   Gore called for an immediate ban on ``non-essential uses of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)'' as propellants in aerosol sprays.
Beyond that, he outlined five other steps, including ``an immediate
$1 per pound assessment of the most harmful CFCs, rising to $5,''
and having the president ``personally call on the leaders of Japan
and Europe to ratify the Montreal protocol, and to put the issue on
the June summit.'' No explanation of that protocol, or much else,
was given.
   Still, in person and in the campaign statement, Gore did take
care to make broader points. The computers are keys to increased
competitiveness, he said. And ozone depletion raises the threat of
skin cancer.
   The candidate who loves to talk technical detail became, in the
campaign press release, ``an environmental Paul Revere.''

   President Reagan today issued a plea to House
Republicans to help him revive his stalled policy of aid to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels, but said Democrats will be to blame if
the rebels go out of existence.
   The president, in a one-hour meeting with House Republicans on
Capitol Hill and later with a group of state and county GOP
officials, called on GOP members to unite behind a new effort to
push some kind of help for the rebels through Congress.
   U.S. aid to the rebels expired Feb. 29.
   ``We are determined to get continued assistance to the
resistance, and if we stick together, this time we'll make it,''
the president told the closed meeting of lawmakers on Capitol Hill,
according to a text of his remarks provided by the White House.
   Alluding, however, to Democratic efforts to thwart any military
aid for the rebels, Reagan added, ``Those who led the fight against
our package of assistance to the democratic resistance cannot
escape responsibility'' if the rebel forces wither.
   Reagan, in response to a reporter's question, declined to say
precisely what kind of aid package he was supporting.
   In a separate session with the local GOP officials, Reagan again
pointed the finger of blame at House Democrats.
   ``The House leadership, who played hardball to win the vote to
cut off aid, now says it won't accept responsibility for the
destruction of the freedom fighters. But if the freedom fighters
are extinguished and communist rule is consolidated in Nicaragua,
the American people will be the ones to decide who is
responsible,'' Reagan said.
   The White House has encouraged a bipartisan group of Contra
supporters in the Senate who are proposing a one-year, $48 million
``humanitarian'' aid package that also would give the CIA the right
to deliver previously stockpiled weapons, and the president the
right to get a quick vote in Congress on sending new military aid
under certain conditions.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters after
Reagan's Capitol Hill visit that the administration has not yet
aligned itself with any specific bill, but would like to have a
package introduced soon and a vote prior to Congress' departure
next week for an Easter recess.
   ``We'd like to have a vote before then,'' Fitzwater said.
   On Capitol Hill, House GOP Leader Robert Michel said the
administration ``will surely be supporting, or at least
encouraging, the kind of movement we are seeing in the Senate.''
   Michel, R-Ill., said last week's incursion across the Honduran
border by Sandinista troops was creating political pressure on some
of the moderate Democrats whose votes have been crucial to the
outcome of the closely divided issue in the past. ``That doesn't do
anything but help our side,'' Michel said.
   Adding to that pressure, said Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., is the
instability in other areas of Central America, including Panama and
El Salvador. ``The whole region is still in an unstable
condition,'' he said. Some moderate Democrats last week ``were
quite pale in their appearance when they realized there was this
incursion'' into Honduras.
   ``We think there is some potential there to get a few more votes
than we have had in the past,'' said Lott, the chief House GOP vote
counter.
   Before the meeting, Reagan told reporters he hopes the
cease-fire talks between the Sandinista government and the rebels
will be successful, but said he would not withhold pressure for new
Contra aid to await the outcome of the talks.
   ``I hope they can achieve something there'' in the talks, he
said. Asked if he would hold up a new request for rebel aid while
the talks are in progress, Reagan replied, ``We haven't given that
any consideration.''
   Before Reagan arrived, Michel said an aid package should be
developed during the cease-fire talks.
   ``We want to be prepared in the event negotiations break down,
so there's always a fallback position,'' Michel said. ``We ought to
be very wary... take a more worst-case scenario.''
   House Democrats said any action on further aid should await the
outcome of those negotiations.
   ``What we need to watch very carefully is the peace talks,''
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said on Monday. ``I hope both
sides will be very forthcoming.''
   The Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels on Monday
opened three days of talks at the border town of Sapoa by
exchanging cease-fire proposals and agreeing to a truce during the
negotiations.
   Asked about prospects for a $48 million Contra aid proposal
being drawn up by Senate backers of the rebels, Wright objected to
provisions that allow the CIA to continue delivering previously
stockpiled weapons and that would guarantee a future vote in
Congress on new military aid.
   ``If they would agree to humanitarian aid without military aid,
that could be done very swiftly,'' Wright said. ``We would be ready
to meet (with Republicans) at any time.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., in a toughly worded
Senate floor speech, said the administration's policies have
produced few positive results.
   ``The United States, after all of this _ not to mention several
hundred million dollars _ has achieved virtually nothing positive
in Central America,'' Byrd said. ``We have no right to ask
Americans to risk their sons and daughters when there are other
solutions we have not even tried.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has invited a Vatican
delegation to help celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in the region, but Pope John Paul II won't be a member
of it, a Vatican official said Tuesday.
   Cardinal Johannes Willebrands made the disclosure at a news
conference at which he presented the pope's letter on the
millennium of Christianity in Kievan Rus', the ancient name of the
Ukraine. The celebrations are scheduled for June.
   The letter stressed Europe's Christian roots and said Christian
unity is essential to peace in Europe and the world.
   Willebrands, president of the Vatican's Secretariat for
Christian Unity, said a representative of the Russian Orthodox
church patriarch made the invitation orally to two officials of his
agency March 18 in Moscow.
   He said John Paul, as head of the Roman Catholic church, was
invited to send a delegation to celebrations in Moscow being
organized by the Russian Orthodox church.
   When an official written invitation is received, the pontiff
will name the delegation for the trip to Moscow, which is expected
to last about 10 days, the Dutch-born cardinal said.
   John Paul often has expressed interest in visiting the Soviet
Union. Willebrands said the pope had not received a personal
invitation to the celebration and had no plans to attend, but that
does not rule out a posssible future visit.
   He said it would not be ``opportune'' for the pope to attend the
observance because ``he cannot make his pastoral visit, which is
destined primarily for Catholics, during celebrations organized by
another church.''
   The pope has said he would visit the Soviet Union if he was
allowed to visit Roman Catholics throughout the country, including
the Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan.
   Three years ago, he disclosed that Soviet authorities had
refused permission for him to visit Lithuania, a Catholic
stronghold.
   In his 39-page letter to bishops around the world, John Paul
urged the faithful to join in prayer to mark the baptism in 988 of
Prince Vladimir on the banks of the Dnieper in Kiev.
   ``The whole Catholic church turns its gaze to that event and
shares spiritually in the joy of the heirs to that baptism,'' he
said.
   John Paul praised Christians in the region, who he said have
sometimes experienced ``persecution and martyrdom'' in those 1,000
years.
   ``In particular, we join with all the heirs of this baptism,
whatever their religious confession, nationality or dwelling place,
with all our Orthodox and Catholic brothers and sisters,'' the
letter said.
   ``In a special way, we join with all the beloved sons and
daughters of the Russian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian nations. To
those who live in their homeland, as also to those who dwell in
America, Western Europe and other parts of the world.''
   The millennium is ``in a special way the feast'' of the Russian
Orthodox church, which ``remains united to the Catholic church with
very close links,'' the pope wrote.
   ``At this solemn moment in history the Catholic community ...
sends to her 1,000-year-old sister church, through the bishop of
Rome, the kiss of peace as a manifestation of an ardent desire for
that perfect communion.''
   In a plea for Christian unity, John Paul said the Christian
roots of Europe present ``a particularly pressing challenge to the
unity of Christians. ... The desire for unity and peace, the desire
that barriers should be broken down and opposition removed . .. is
becoming an impelling sign of our times.''
   ``True peace can only exist on the basis of a process of
unification in which each people is able to choose, in freedom and
truth, the path of its own development.''

   The American space program will be crippled
and U.S. leadership threatened if Congress fails to approve the
$11.5 billion requested by NASA, space agency officials said today.
   James C. Fletcher, NASA administrator, said that fiscal 1989,
which begins in October, ``is a crucial year for NASA. It will make
or break the civil space program.''
   He said the $11.5-billion budget requested by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration is a ``bare bones'' request,
with most of the money going to maintaining programs already
underway.
   ``The entire future of the U.S. civil space program rides at
risk in this budget,'' said Fletcher.
   He said that the money would be applied to three basic elements:
   _Building up the flight rate for the space shuttle once missions
resume in August. There are two space flights set for this year, he
said, seven in 1989 and 10 in 1990.
   _Building up hardware development for the space station, which
he said is essential for American leadership in space.
   _Continuing the space science programs in astronomy and
planetary research, developing advanced rocket engines for the
shuttle and financing the Pathfinder program, which would develop
new technology for possible missions to Mars.
   Fletcher made the comments as leadoff witness before the Senate
subcommittee on science, technology and space, which is beginning
to consider the fiscal 1989 NASA budget.

<HEAD>Hanford Nuclear Reservation Plant Shut Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hanford nuclear reservation plutonium
processing plant was shut down and two technicians were suspended
in the wake of an incident involving the improper transfer of
chemicals, a Westinghouse Hanford spokesman said today.
   Operations at the Plutonium-Uranium Extraction Plant, or PUREX,
were suspended over the weekend as a precautionary measure, said
spokesman Rudy Cortez.
   The temporary suspension resulted from an incident Friday in
which a valve was left open and a batch of the wrong chemical
solution was transferred to a tank, Cortez said.
   As a consequence, the certifications of two nuclear process
operators were suspended for failing to follow operating
procedures, he said. The event was declared to be an infraction of
a ``criticality prevention specification.''
   A ``criticality'' is an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction
resulting in a rapid buildup of radiation and heat. It is caused by
such factors as the amount, shape, density and enrichment of
plutonium or uranium and the manner in which they are stored.
   There was no danger of a criticality incident and no danger of a
radioactiuve release to the environment, Cortez said. It has not
been determined how long operations will be suspended, he said.
   The PUREX plant was closed for a time in October 1986 because of
safety concerns over plutonium handling and possible accidents.
Westinghouse Hanford officials who took over operation of the
plants in July 1987 promised to make safety a top priority.
   The chemical transfer incidents were the latest in a series of
safety-related ones at the PUREX facility, which dissolves fuel
rods to remove plutonium and uranium for reprocessing.
   The cause of contamination of two crane operators at the
facility March 14 is still under investigation. Radioactive
contamination was found in one crane operator's home and another
contamination was found on another operator as he prepared to leave
the plant. Both men were decontaminated and returned to work the
next day.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Decline Again, But Economists Still
Optimistic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods fell 1.8 percent in February, but analysts said the
second consecutive monthly decline had not shaken their belief that
manufacturing will be a bright spot in the economy this year.
   The Commerce Department report Tuesday said that orders for
durable goods _ items expected to last three or more years _
totaled a seasonally adjusted $111.4 billion in February, following
an identical 1.8 percent January decline.
   It was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable
goods orders have fallen for two consecutive months.
   The February decline surprised economists, but they maintained
that manufacturing companies were still enjoying boom times because
the weaker dollar has boosted export demand.
   ``The fundamentals continue to look positive for
manufacturing,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston
Co. ``What we have is a two-month hesitation after some big
increases.''
   Manufacturing is expected to be a major source of strength this
year as businesses step up production to meet rising export demand
and American companies increase orders for capital equipment to
expand their production capabilities.
   The Reagan administration is forecasting that almost half of all
economic growth in 1988 will come from rising export demand.
   Still, analysts said the back-to-back declines did show that
businesses were cutting back on orders in the early part of 1988 in
an effort to get control of bulging inventories. Inventories
swelled at the end of 1987 while consumer demand fell.
   Economists once had feared this combina4hn could be enough to
topple the country into a recession. But brighter statistics this
year, including continue declines in the unemployment rate in
February, have eased those concerns.
   CynthIaXLatta, an economist with Data Resources Ik#-, noted that
while new orders fell in February, the toas no immediate response from
the rebels, who have been
supported by the United States since the start of their fight in
late 1981.
   Negotiators for both sides were optimistic after the first day
of cease-fire talks Monday, the first held since December.
   Also Monday, Nicaragua withdrew its soldiers from the Honduran
border and declared an end to fighting with Contra rebels while the
talks are held in Sapoa. The Honduran military reported Sandinista
soldiers had retreated.
   ``The importance of today was that we listened for the first
time at the highest level their (Contras') proposal, Gen. Humberto
Ortega, Nicaragua's defense minister, told journalists in Sapoa on
Monday.
   Alfredo Cesar, a negotiator for the U.S.-backed rebels, called
the first round a ``step ahead'' and said they discussed a wide
range of issues.
   ``Neither side seeks a military victory over the other,'' Cesar
said.
   Monday's session was held under tight security at the customs
post in this town beside the border with Costa Rica, along the bank
of Lake Nicaragua.
   At stake in the talks, scheduled to resume today, is an end to
the bloodshed that has claimed an estimated 50,000 dead and wounded
and shattered the country's economy.
   The Sandinista proposal to stop the fighting calls for an
``immediate and definitive cease-fire,'' Ortega said. He did not
elaborate.
   The Contra plan calls for a 30-day truce, political amnesty,
press freedom and continued talks to work out a lasting cease-fire,
Cesar said.
   Frank Arana, a rebel spokesman, said the talks went beyond the
bounds earlier established by the Sandinistas and included
political issues and ``concepts of democracy.''
   ``We spoke about everything,'' he said.
   The goal of the Sandinistas is to work out a viable cease-fire
in accordance with the regional peace plan signed last August by
the presidents of the five Central American nations. They had said
the talks would cover only the mechanics of how the Contras would
lay down their arms.
   The rebels said the talks should include discussion of
democratic reforms, also covered in the regional peace plan.
   ``We came here with an open agenda,'' Adolfo Calero, a Contra
leader, told journalists at the border post. ``And that includes
democratization including amnesty. We insisted on speaking about
all the problems facing Nicaragua.''
   Negotiations opened after Ortega, brother of President Daniel
Ortega, said the Sandinistas were suspending military operations
for the duration of the talks and called on the Contras to do the
same.
   Sandinista spokesman Manuel Espinoza told reporters the
``reciprocation of the Contras'' in agreeing to suspend hostilities
and ``the fact that this meeting is taking place are the first
positive steps'' toward a permanent cease-fire.
   President Ortega on Monday signed a document that dealt with a
number of internal problems. The statement called on all political
parties to refrain from violence, a position targeted at the
government supporters who have attacked the opposition.
   It also calls for the media to respect the government, a
reference to the opposition newspaper La Prensa, and the
Sandinistas promised to release more than a dozen recently jailed
labor leaders and review cases of imprisoned opposition
politiciaans.
   The Sandinistas' willingness to comply with the peace plan was
cited by U.S. congressional members as a reason for rejecting
President Reagan's calls for additional military and nonlethal aid
to the rebels. The peace plan also calls for internal dialogue with
the political opposition.

   Southern Methodist University is considering a
tougher sexual harassment policy that could result in the demotion
or firing of faculty members found to be romantically involved with
students.
   Under the proposal, if a student files a complaint, the faculty
member would appear before a committee, which would evaluate
evidence and decide punishment.
   ``The faculty have been the prime movers for this policy,'' Leon
Bennett, vice president for legal affairs, said Monday. ``We're not
trying to create a hostile environment, we're trying to prevent
one.''
   Civil libertarians say such a policy might infringe on a
person's constitutional right of free association. Other critics
question whether a university can, or should, regulate
relationships between adults.
   SMU, like most universities, prohibits faculty and staff from
making sexual advances and seeking sexual favors in exchange for
favorable treatment.
   Officials at SMU say they have received 10 sexual harassment
complaints in the last five years, Everett Winters, director of
SMU's Office of Affirmative Action, said. Although some professors
have been reprimanded, none have been dismissed, demoted or taken
to court.
   Lindley Doran, director of the Human Resources Women's Center,
said the harassment policy was proposed by the center and the
universitiy's Commission on Status of Women. The Faculty Senate
approved it in the spring of 1987.
   She said the proposal is now with the administration, which is
investigating what legal sanctions can be used. The faculty Senate
would then review the proposal. With its approval, it will go to
the Trustees.
   Ms. Doran said she thinks the proposal will be university policy
by the end of the semester.

   Bystanders looked on but no one intervened
while a man was stabbed to death on a crowded downtown sidewalk,
police said.
   ``There were people standing around the incident and watching it
go down,'' police Detective Larry Martinez said of Monday's 10:30
a.m. attack.
   ``It's non-involvement,'' he said. ``It's like a disease. These
people have to live with themselves. I just wish they had a bigger
conscience. It would be easier on us.''
   It was the second such murder to occur in front of crowds near
the busy intersection of Seventh and Spring streets in four months.
On Nov. 17, Roberto Lopez, 23, was knifed to death shortly after
5:30 p.m. in what was believed to be a drug-related case.
   The 32-year-old man killed Monday was knifed several times in
what Martinez said was also possibly drug-related. His identity
still wasn't known Tuesday and police said they had no suspects in
the case.
   Investigators believe the man staggered a short distance after
he was stabbed. An off-duty officer working nearby on a movie
production was alerted about the incident and contacted paramedics
and police.

   Six months after Pope John Paul II's second U.S. visit, Roman
Catholic leaders in three of the nine cities where he stopped still
have bills to pay.
   The Archdiocese of San Francisco owes as much as $2 million, and
the nearby Diocese of Monterey still has at least $1 million to
repay, church officials say. In Phoenix, Ariz., the church has yet
to pay nearly $165,000 for renting a stadium.
   Church officials say the debts are paid for the pope's stops in
Miami, Columbia, S.C., New Orleans, San Antonio, Texas, Los Angeles
and Detroit.
   ``We knew we would have some deficit, but we didn't think it
would be of this magnitude,'' said Bruce Egnew, director of finance
for the Archdiocese of San Francisco. He said the church has raised
$2 million since the visit, but still owes at least $1.5 million.
   The Rev. Miles Riley, chief publicist for the archdiocese, put
the total at $2 million.
   The Monterey Diocese has a debt of $1.1 million, said spokesman
Ted Elisee.
   To help retire the debt, the San Francisco Archdiocese plans to
sell pieces of the elaborate $500,000, six-tiered stage used for
the Mass at Candlestick Park. There are also plans for collections
in the churches, receptions and direct appeals to the community,
said Egnew.
   ``It's always harder to raise money after the event,'' said
Riley. ``Not a little bit harder, a lot harder.''
   On the plus side, Riley said last week, he had just received a
letter from a man who had been inspired to return to the church
after a 20-year absence. He enclosed a check for $500, Riley said.
   Elisee said the Monterey Diocese spent $2 million and still owed
$1 million to $1.1 million. The diocese plans an appeal to its 45
parishes, which have 145,000 members, and the church has been
selling memorial magazines at $5 each and videotapes for $25.
   In some cities, church officials dipped into reserve funds and
other accounts to cover the difference between costs and
fund-raising efforts. That amounted to $400,000 in Miami, $200,000
in New Orleans and $1.3 million in Detroit, officials in those
cities said.
   In San Antonio, the church came out a bit ahead, raising $2.4
million but spending 2.32 million, said the Rev. Larry Steubben,
chairman of the Texas Papal Visit Committee.
   It was just last week that the Diocese of Phoenix was billed for
$164,765 for the use of Arizona State University's Sun Devil
Stadium. Church officials had said in January that they faced a
deficit, but did not say how much.
   Last week, the Rev. John McMahon, head of the diocese's
papal-visit committee, declined to comment on the debt. ``We just
got the bill from ASU and we want to see where we are,'' he said
last week.

   Three-year-old Ashley Hopkins never
heard a sound until the beep of a computer intruded on her silence.
She cried.
   ``I shouldn't be happy to see Ash's tears, but I am,'' said her
mother, Janie Hopkins, who cried some herself. ``That means it's
working.''
   The Englewood girl is believed to be the youngest person to get
a cochlear implant.
   Thomas J. Balkany implanted the $17,000 electronic hearing aid
during an operation at Porter Memorial Hospital. The 22-channel
device stimulates the hearing nerve. The implant, considered
experimental in children, bypasses damaged inner-ear cells by
stimulating a tiny portion of the nerve fibers in the cochlea.
   Doctors say Ashley eventually will be able to hear her own
voice. The device also will help her pick up intonation patterns of
people she is talking to and should improve her lip-reading.
   ``Without this, she has no hope of talking properly,'' Hopkins
said. ``She wants to be in the hearing world with everyone else.''
   An implant patient must wear a nickel-size microphone on his
ear. The microphone is linked to a battery pack that modulates the
microphone's electrical signal, which ultimately stimulates the
hearing nerve.
   Bernice Dinner, Ashley's audiologist, said the noise transmitted
to the cochlea is nothing like sounds in the hearing world; it is a
monotone, like a bee's buzzing.
   ``She's going to learn that sensation is sound,'' Dinner said.
``She doesn't know that yet. She doesn't have a label for it.''
   The first time Dinner activated the electronic device by
computer, the little girl shrugged a shoulder. The second time, she
rolled her eyes.
   ``The first two times were more like a brushing sensation, a
tickling in her inner ear,'' Dinner said.
   The third time, Dinner calibrated the electronic signal higher
so it was loud and painful. Ashley cried.

   A brochure about AIDS intended for
sexually active adults was mistakenly distributed to teen-agers, an
AIDS program director said.
   ``We're sorry it happened,'' said Edward Darstein, executive
director of the Western New York AIDS program. ``But we've done a
lot of good work over the past five years, and we hope this won't
wreck our record.''
   State Sen. Walter J. Floss was not satisfied, and said Monday he
complained to the governor and state health commissioner.
   Floss said he directed his staff to investigate whether state
funds were used to print the brochures. Darstein said his
organization receives about 90 percent of its $198,000 budget from
the state but private donations funded the brochures.
   Darstein said the brochures were handed out March 9 by a
volunteer who spoke at Pavilion Central School and a second place
and left the wrong brochures at the school.
   The brochure rates the risk of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome infection from various forms of sexual activity, both
homosexual and heterosexual.

   A man who allegedly sought romance
rather than religion has been barred by a judge from attending a
church.
   Judge Anne Dranginis issued a temporary restraining order Monday
prohibiting John Steinmann, 78, of Middlebury from attending the
First Congregational Church of Washington.
   ``We believe his motives to worship are not consistent with
promoting the worship of God, but for the purpose of forming
relationships, particularly with women,'' said the Rev. Richard
Sears, pastor of the chruch.
   The judge's order also prohibits Steinmann from harassing or
contacting church members without their permission.
   According to court documents, Steinmann, member of a Middlebury
church, began attending services in rural Washington in an attempt
to maintain a relationship with his former wife.
   The couple has since divorced, the woman moved and Steinmann
used the church to meet other women, church officials said.
   Church officials filed for the court orders Monday, a day after
Steinmann was arrested for the third time on charges of criminal
trespassing at the church.
   Virginia Steinway of Morris, testified Steinmann once sidled up
to her in a pew, grabbed her arm and made lewd and revolting
remarks to her during a hymn. ``I was extremely panicked,'' she
said.
   Steinmann, who represented himself in court, maintained his
actions were consistent with the church's policy of Christian
fellowship.

   Moslem nations were united Tuesday behind
the Palestinian rebellion in Israeli-occupied lands, but Iran and
Iraq traded insults and there was no Islamic accord on the
7{-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   Foreign ministers of the 46-member Organization of the Islamic
Conference issued a statement condemning ``oppressive and criminal
measures by the (Israeli) authorities against our brothers.''
   Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister, claimed Iran was aiding the
emigration of Iranian Jews to Israel, according to a text of his
remarks.
   In the statement about the rebellion, which began Dec. 8 in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the ministers said: ``All
Moslems in the world are proud of this uprising.''
   That echoed a speech by King Hussein of Jordan at the opening of
the conference Monday, in which he said the ``blood of martyrs''
was being shed in the territories. More than 100 Arabs have been
killed since the violence began.
   The ministers declared: ``Members of the organization are
concerned to support Palestinians financially, politically and
morally and also to back their sole legitimate representative, the
PLO.''
   No indication was given of what form aid would take, or whether
there would be financial assistance, and the statement did not
elaborate.
   Tajer Masri, Jordan's foreign minister, told reporters: ``We can
only provide support in a political manner, to pressure the world's
nations to get them to pressure Israel and reveal the meaning of
the uprising. I don't remember seeing any request for financial
support.''
   Farouk Kaddoumi, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
equivalent of a foreign minister, said the statement was valuable
to the PLO and especially ``for the people inside the territories.''
   About U.S. plans to close the PLO's U.N. observer mission in New
York under terms of an anti-terrorist law, Kaddoumi said:
   ``We will keep the office open until American police come and
seal it off. Then we will go to the United Nations (headquarters)
and live there.''
   Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, said the alleged help given
Iranian Jews to move to Israel was ``a violation of the rules'' of
the Organization of Islamic Conference.''
   ``How come Iran, which claims to support the Palestinian issue
and the uprising, is helping Jews to migrate to Israel?'' There was
no elaboration in a text of his prepared remarks made available to
The Associated Press.
   He gave no figures on the number of alleged emigrants. The
Iranian envoy, Mohammed Ali Taskhiri, denied the claim and accused
Iraq of being ``Zionist.''
   The point is sensitive in the Arab and Moslem world because many
nations do not recognize Israel's right to exist and oppose the
emigration of Jews to the country.

   Testimony ended today on the first of three
impeachment charges against Gov. Evan Mecham, but a move for a
quick vote on whether to oust Mecham from office was withdrawn in
the face of vehement opposition.
   ``It would be our everlasting disgrace if we do not consider all
of the evidence from both sides in such a historic and important
case,'' said Republican Sen. Jon Hays.
   After testimony ended on the first impeachment count, a charge
that Mecham tried to thwart an investigation into a death threat,
Democratic state Sen. Carolyn Walker proposed that the Senate
consider voting on that charge alone.
   The Senate had earlier agreed to hear evidence on all three
charges before voting on any one. Conviction on the first count
alone would have ended the trial early with the first term
Republican removed from office.
   ``I would think if Governor Mecham is exonerated he would be
extremely happy to know he has one less article to face,'' she
said. ``And if he is convicted, we should not go on and spend
untold dollars of taxpayers money.''
   In a heated debate, the motion won support from Democrats but
was opposed by Republicans, and Walker finally withdrew it. A
two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate would have been required to
change the trial rules.
   The prosecution then said it was ready to begin presenting
evidence on the second charge against Mecham _ alleged that he
misused $80,000 from a state fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership.
   The last witness on the obstruction of justice count was
Mecham's lawyer, Fred Craft, who this morning seized the
opportunity to give a lengthy speech in praise of Mecham's
political philsophy. He called Mecham an ``uncommon politician''
who sought no personal aggrandizement and wanted only to improve
the quality of life in Arizona.
   The speech brought an objection from prosecutor Paul Eckstein
and Craft was instructed to stick to answering questions.
   Craft, in an abrupt role change, became a witness Monday and
said Mecham ``didn't know that he was obstructing anything'' when
he told the state's top lawman he would not cooperate with the
attorney general's investigation of the alleged death threat.
   Craft was subpoenaed at the request of the Democratic minority
leader, Sen. Alan Stephens. Craft was a Mecham insider when the
threat against a witness before a grand jury investigating Mecham
was reported to the governor on Nov. 13.
   ``I never heard `felony.' I never heard `death threat' and I
certainly never heard `tampering with a grand jury witness,'''
Craft said Monday. ``I never heard those words, which would have
been an alarm to me.''
   Later, in his cross-examination, Eckstein asked Craft whether he
had ever advised the embattled governor to resign.
   ``We had these meetings and no one could see a political escape
route for the governor,'' Craft said. ``No one was offering the
governor any other political option than to go down with the ship.''
   Thefirst charge alleged that Mecham tried to thwart the
investigation of the alleged death threat against former top Mecham
aide Donna Carlson by Mecham confidant Lee Watkins. At the time,
Ms. Carlson was about to testify before the state grand jury about
Mecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The next article charges Mecham with misusing $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. The
third impeachment article accuses him of concealing the $350,000
campaign loan.
   Craft and co-defense counsel Jerris Leonard said they opposed
taking an early vote. ``We ought to hear all the evidence on all
three articles and then let them vote,'' Leonard said.
   In his testimony, Craft echoed Mecham in contending the governor
was not fully informed that the situation involved a felony and the
possible tampering of a grand jury witness.
   ``Nobody said the house is burning down, we've got a crisis,''
Craft said. ``I didn't know that a crime had been committed.''
   However, Sen. John Mawhinney, a Republican, noted that
then-chief of staff Richard Burke testified that he considered the
matter to be serious and that he assumed the Department of Public
Safety was investigating.
   ``What is mystifying is how two people can sit in the same
meeting'' and come away with different impressions, Mawhinney said.
   A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to convict Mecham,
the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades and the
first ever in Arizona.
   Mecham also faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of
concealing the $350,000 campaign loan, and a May 17 recall election.

<HEAD>Familiar Froufrou at Ungaro, Safe Classics at Laroche</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inimitable Emanuel Ungaro has toned down his
sexy, exaggerated look, but he had enough opulent fabrics in his
Tuesday winter ready-to-wear show to please the fans of his
show-off styles.
   Laroche, by contrast, preferred the ultra simple lines, in short
skirts and tailored pants.
   Ungaro, along with Christian Lacroix and some others, remains in
the ``feminine-fancy'' school of designing, despite this season's
trend to somewhat simpler, more practical styles.
   In one variation on the tent dress, he puts bright flowered and
flowing silk or light wool tunics over narrow skirts. But Ungaro
also sneaked in a print chemise dress from the 1950s, knotted and
draped baggily in back.
   Rose, salmon and dusky shades of blue and green or brighter
tones all turned up in Ungaro's vast color palette. Crazy over
fabrics, he mixed them with somewhat less abandon this time around.
   Paisley, brown or camel colored short coats were often paired
with outfits that had lean knee-revealing skirts in polished
leather: a flashy, fascinating new look here.
   Ungaro still likes big bertha or flounced collars using them on
lots of ensembles. He can't forget leg o'mutton sleeves, ruffles
and bows, either.
   As usual, velvet was used richly in Ungaro's suits _ as a
single-lapelled collar, a wide jacket-hem border, or overall in
dressy suits in shades of claret, deep purple or black.
   Another success in opulence was to pair a velvet-piped paisley
long and fitted jacket with a teeny draped black jersey cashmere
skirt.
   Even pants looked dressy, with their little velvet or
irridescent taffeta vests and fitted jackets, plus flowered
blouses. Bows on derrieres or the hips of draped pants gilded the
lily a bit.
   Ungaro's body-hugging draped cocktail numbers were less risque
than last season, nearly hitting the knee instead of grazing the
upper thigh.
   Ungaro's less expensive line called ``Solo Donna,'' shown last
week, had much of the same allure, but looked much more
comfortable. His ribbed spencers with flowered sheaths or his
checked skirts with windowpane plaid reefers could even be worn to
the office without raising eyebrows.
   At Guy Laroche, meanwhile, the trend to short skirts continued,
but the collection looked more sane than sexy. Designed by Guy
Douvier, the clothes had a certain played-down attraction.
   Soft wool coats were ample and short, with caped and huge
squared-off collars. These were worn over tailored trouser suits
and dresses in browns, tans or striking jewel colors.
   Bright belted tunics with dark skirts or straight tunics with
elaborate wool embroidery in swirly ribbon patterns were also items
for the safe dresser.
   The diagonal plaid belted suits in frank yellow, green or red
make a peppy change.
   Late-day flocked velvet or cloque silk suits were easily fitted,
and dance dresses with shirred tops and puffy taffeta skirts also
came down the runway. The shocking pink or black flounced taffeta
gowns, short in front, long in back, are no shockers, but are gala
enough to wear without looking like a wallflower.
   Hermes, usually known for expensive hand-finished leather bags
and scarves, is making a bigger effort to steer customers to the
ready-to-wear racks.
   Designed by Eric Bergere, the line remained firmly in the
classic sportswear vein. As the redingote sweeps Paris, Hermes had
the last word in its brown or red models topped with jumpers'
netted bowler hats.
   But fitted suits with oval skirts and plaid spencers or A-line
jackets over slim gray flannel hats looked just as appealing for a
country weekend or informal moments in town.
   Even if the clothes don't set trends, they will never look out
of place, especially with those incomparable silk scarves.

<HEAD>Mormons Receive Permission To Build First Chapel In Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have granted Polish Mormons
permission to build their first chapel in this communist country, a
church missionary said Tuesday.
   The only other Soviet bloc country in which there are Mormon
chapels is East Germany, where there are about 5,000 members of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   Although Polish authorities registered the Mormon Church as an
official religious organization in 1977, only recently were there
enough Polish Mormons to warrant building a chapel, said Elder
Juliusz Fussek.
   Fussek, 66, a U.S. citizen of Polish descent, was sent to Poland
to do missionary work by the church headquarters in Salt Lake City.
He is a retired printer.
   There are only about 100 Mormons in this overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic country, but Fussek said he saw ``great prospects'' for
the church's development ``because people are interested in
religion here.''
   ``You need members first before building a chapel ... Because
there is no point having a chapel and it standing empty,'' said
Fussek.
   ``We are very pleased with the cooperation and help we have
received from the government,'' he said.
   At the end of last year, Polish Mormons applied for permission
to build a chapel and cultural-educational center in Warsaw's
western Wola district, Fussek said.
   The local council for Wola approved the project at a meeting
last week and forwarded its decision to the Warsaw city president
for formal approval, he said.
   Fussek said the chapel, expected to open in 1989 or 1990, would
be paid for by donations from Polish Mormons and the church
headquarters in Salt Lake City. He did not have any estimate of the
cost.
   Fussek said there were about 300-400 Mormons, mostly of German
descent, in the country before World War II. The Mormon chapel did
not reopen after the war because most of its members fled the
country when the Communists took power.
   More than 35 religious denominations are active in Poland today.
Ninety percent of Poland's 37 million people are baptized Catholics.

   Czechoslovak and Soviet ground
troops Tuesday started week-long war games in northwestern Bohemia
to be watched by foreign observers, according to an official report.
   The March 22-28 exercise involves 17,400 Soviet and Czechoslovak
troops, the CTK news agency reported.
   Under an 1986 accord reached at the Stockholm Conference on
Confidence and Security-building Measures and Disarmament, large
exercises held by the Warsaw Pact and NATO require advance
notification and inspection by foreign observers.
   Czechoslovak First Deputy Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Jiri Brychta
said 43 observers from 22 countries, including the United States,
West Germany and Britain, will watch the maneuvers.
   Brychta was quoted as saying the maneuvers are the third to be
watched by Western military officers in Czechoslovakia, while
Czechoslovak observers last year saw eight exercises staged by
North Atlantic Treaty Organization members.

   The Sandinista government and Contra
rebels today announced proposals for an extended cease-fire that
would include amnesty and steps toward a lasting peace.
   The leftist government's proposal, outlined in a statement to
journalists on the second day of peace talks at this post on the
Costa Rican border, calls for a 30-day truce with the rebels
intended for them to lay down their arms and ``rejoin Nicaraguan
society.''
   It also provides for the release of a political prisoner for
each rebel accepting amnesty. Deputy Foreign Minister Victory Hugo
Tinoco told reporters there are 3,300 prisoners the government
considers eligible for release under the program.
   The Contra proposal calls for a 45-day truce starting on Good
Friday, April 1, in which rebel fighters would move into cesae-fire
zones still to be determined.
   It said the government should grant ``total and unconditional
amnesty'' as soon as the truce takes effect, allowing anyone who
left Nicaragua for political reasons to ``rejoin the political,
economic and social process without any conditions.''
   The rebels also want to join a national dialogue between the
Sandinistas and their internal political opponents while the
cease-fire lasts. The government also would allow rebel leaders to
participate in national reconciliation talks.
   ``At the moment in which a cease-fire is signed, whether it be
for 30, 60 or 90 days, according to what the counterrevolution
wants, at that moment the leadership of the Nicaraguan Resistance
will be able to rejoin civic and political life and even
participate in the national dialogue that seeks a reconciliation of
all Nicaraguans,'' Tinoco said.
   Both proposals call for international monitoring of the
cease-fire.
   The two sides agreed Monday to a cease-fire during the three
days of talks, the first ever held on Nicaraguan territory in more
than 6 years of war and the first direct talks without a mediator.
   Rebel and government negotiators for both sides were optimistic
after the first round of peace talks Monday, the first held since
December.
   Also Monday, Nicaragua withdrew its soldiers from the Honduran
border. The Honduran military reported Sandinista soldiers had
retreated.
   ``The importance of today was that we listened for the first
time at the highest level their (Contras') proposal, Gen. Humberto
Ortega, Nicaragua's defense minister, said Monday.
   Alfredo Cesar, a negotiator for the U.S.-backed rebels, called
the first round a ``step ahead'' and said the delegations discussed
a wide range of issues. ``Neither side seeks a military victory
over the other,'' he said.
   At stake in the talks is an end to the bloodshed that has
claimed an estimated 50,000 dead and wounded and shattered the
country's economy.
   Frank Arana, a rebel spokesman, said the talks went beyond the
bounds earlier established by the Sandinistas and included
political issues and ``concepts of democracy.''
   ``We spoke about everything,'' he said.
   The goal of the Sandinistas is to work out a viable cease-fire
in accordance with the regional peace plan signed last August by
the presidents of the five Central American nations. They had said
the talks would cover only the mechanics of how the Contras would
lay down their arms.
   The rebels said the talks should include discussion of
democratic reforms, also covered in the regional peace plan.
   ``We came here with an open agenda,'' Adolfo Calero, a Contra
leader, told reporters. ``And that includes democratization
including amnesty. We insisted on speaking about all the problems
facing Nicaragua.''
   President Daniel Ortega on Monday signed a document that dealt
with a number of internal problems. The statement called on all
political parties to refrain from violence, a position targeted at
the government supporters who have attacked the opposition.
   It also calls for the media to respect the government, a
reference to the opposition newspaper La Prensa, and the
Sandinistas promised to release more than a dozen recently jailed
labor leaders and review cases of imprisoned opposition
politiciaans.
   The Sandinistas' willingness to comply with the peace plan was
cited by U.S. congressional members as a reason for rejecting
President Reagan's calls for additional military and nonlethal aid
to the rebels. The peace plan also calls for internal dialogue with
the political opposition.

   Richard Gephardt said today fellow Democrat Michael Dukakis has
undergone a ``battlefield conversion'' on the trade issue to try to
win votes in Michigan. Vice President George Bush lent his support
to President Reagan's veto of a civil rights bill, saying he's
``not going to start differing with the president now.''
   Democratic contenders Albert Gore Jr. and Paul Simon flew back
to Washington to cast their votes for an override. Gore criticized
Bush's loyalty to Reagan ``even when the proposals are ... dumb.''
   Gephardt was angered by Dukakis' change-of-mind on trade
legislation and he accused the Massachusetts governor of a
flip-flop to improve his chances in Saturday's caucuses in
Michigan, where 138 delegates are at stake.
   ``Now we're getting some battlefield conversions on trade. ...
The acid test on trade is the Gephardt amendment,'' the Missouri
congressman told senior citizens in Madison Heights, Mich.
   Last night, Gephardt told reporters, ``On the central issue in
this campaign, Mike Dukakis is trying to have it both ways.''
   Dukakis on Monday endorsed a trade bill put forward by Michigan
Sen. Donald Riegle, which Gephardt said was very similar to his
measure. The Massachusetts governor has opposed Gephardt's bill.
Riegle endorsed Dukakis Monday as did Michigan congressmen Dale
Kildee and Bob Traxler.
   ``This is no change in my position,'' Dukakis responded at his
own news conference.
   Michigan did not have the spotlight to itself as candidates from
both parties are stumping in Connecticut, with its primary a week
from today, and Wisconsin, a week later.
   Dukakis was making a foray into neighboring Connecticut today,
where he appeared well-positioned to add to his string of wins on
his New England home turf. Campaign sources said Dukakis will
receive a sought-after endorsement on Wednesday from New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley, who has been mentioned as a possible dark-horse
Democratic nominee if the convention is deadlocked.
   Gore, still searching for a Northern breakthrough after
establishing his candidacy in the South, met today with
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey, who said afterward he still hasn't
decided whether to endorse a candidate before the state's April 26
primary. On Monday, the Tennessee senator met with New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, who said some nice things about him but didn't endorse
him.
   Although Connecticut is one of Bush's home states _ his father
represented it in the U.S. Senate, and his mother and brother still
live in the state _ the vice president said he was taking nothing
for granted there.
   ``I don't want to be beaten in this state,'' he said as he
campaigned in Bloomfield on Monday. In Connecticut, reporters asked
Bush whether he backed President Reagan's veto of a sweeping civil
rights bill.
   ``I'm not going to start differing with the president now,'' he
replied.
   Later Bush told black supporters in Washington that he supports
the idea that institutions receiving federal money should comply
with civil rights laws. But he said the civil rights measure,
passed overwhelmingly by both the House and the Senate, was flawed.
   ``The legislation ... is imperfect and the imperfections should
be corrected,'' he said. Up until Monday, Bush had not said
directly whether he supported the veto.
   ``I'm not going to start doing now what I haven't been doing for
seven years, finding differences with the president, for whom I
have great respect,'' he said.
   The measure would forbid the distribution of federal funds to
entire institutions, state and local government agencies and many
corporations if any part of them practices discrimination. The
administration supports a plan that would grant religious schools
and organizations as well as corporations more exemptions from
civil rights laws.
   Bush said he believed the president should have line-item veto
powers so he could ``take some of the extremes'' out of bills like
the one in question.
   Earlier Monday, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean endorsed Bush, and
New Jersey's 21 county GOP chairmen followed suit. New Jersey's
primary is June 7.
   Bush's Republican opponent, down-but-not-out Bob Dole, was in
Wisconsin, where he again challenged the vice president to a
debate. But Bush has rebuffed Dole's calls for a faceoff, saying it
is time to turn the attention to differences with the Democrats.
   Gephardt was campaigning in the must-win state of Michigan,
wooing workers at a steel mill and making appearances with Chrysler
Corp. chief Lee Iacocca at his side. Iacocca says he likes
Gephardt's trade stance, but isn't formally supporting him.
   Gephardt's says his trade views _ raising the threat of
sanctions if foreign barriers don't come down _ are getting a good
reception in the industrial state of Michigan.
   ``The people in Michigan are interested in someone who is really
going to stand up on the trade issue,'' he said in Highland Park.
   Jesse Jackson made a visit to Colorado, which holds Democratic
caucuses on April 4, and met Monday with ex-candidate Gary Hart.
   Jackson said Hart was going to advise his campaign on policy
matters. Hart said, however, that he wasn't formally endorsing
Jackson. That, he said, would be ``old-fashioned.''
   Hart abandoned his Democratic bid earlier this month, 10 months
after quitting the first time over reports about his relationship
with a Miami model.
   Jackson was campaigning in Michigan today.
   Simon's campaign on Monday was talking up his plans for a big
media buy in Wisconsin. Simon won his home-state primary in
Illinois last week without buying any television ads. He has said
he hopes for a ``respectable'' showing in Michigan, although he
can't spend much money in the state.

   The Senate voted 73-24 today to override
President Reagan's veto of a bill reversing a Supreme Court
decision that narrowed the scope of laws to prevent federally
funded discrimination against women, minorities, the elderly and
the handicapped.
   The Civil Rights Restoration Act went directly to the House,
where leaders also said they had the votes to override the veto.
Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the House would vote
tonight.
   ``We expect a vote to override,'' House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, said Monday. The House passed the bill 315-98 and
Republican head-counters said only a dozen members at most were
expected to move into the president's corner.
   The Senate vote was more than the two-thirds majority needed to
override a presidential veto. The bill initially passed 75-14. To
become law over a president's veto, the legislation must be
approved by a two-thirds vote of both chambers.
   The House and Senate votes capped a four-year struggle to
overturn the 1984 Supreme Court decision.
   The Senate vote came after several senators, including acting
Republican Leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming, condemned what they
called a misinformation campaign launched by conservative opponents
of the bill. Simpson, who voted to sustain the veto, nonetheless
said he was concerned about erroneous claims that it would create
``massive new rights.''
   Some opponents have claimed the bill would require churches to
hire active homosexual drug addicts with AIDS to counsel children.
Proponents of the bill say it offers no protection for homosexuals
or drug or alcohol addicts.
   Even as the Senate prepared to vote, Reagan urged Congress to
sustain his veto.
   ``I ask every senator and representative to rise above the
pressures of an election year, to make a stand for religious
liberty by sustaining my veto of this dangerous bill,'' Reagan said
in a speech to local Republican officials from around the country.
   ``The truth is, this legislation isn't a civil rights bill,''
the president said. ``It's a power grab by Washington, designed to
take control away from states, localities, communities, parents and
the private sector and give it to federal bureaucrats and judges.
   ``One dollar in federal aid _ direct or indirect _ would bring
entire organizations under federal control, from charitable social
organizations to churches and synagogues.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said Reagan
discussed the reasons for his veto today in a meeting with House
Republicans and outlined the alternative he proposed last week.
   ``It's rather too bad that that alternative did not get to us
earlier on than the time it was presented,'' Michel said.
   The Reagan alternative would enable more institutions to escape
regulation on religious grounds and limit most corporate compliance
requirements to specific plants or facilities receiving federal aid.
   The court ruled that an organization or governmental body
getting federal support must comply with anti-discrimination rules
only for the program receiving the federal aid, not for the entire
organization. The bill would cut off aid for the whole organization
if discrimination against minorities, women, the elderly or the
disabled was practiced by any part of the organization.
   ``Obviously there's a very organized and promoted campaign''
against the bill, said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd said.
``Apparently the White House let the word out, as we began getting
hundreds of calls (that) all said the same thing.''
   ``I think a lot of misinformation has been spread,'' Byrd added.
``There's a great deal of misinformation, distortion of truth and
fact.''
   The Civil Rights Restoration Act passed both chambers earlier
this year by lopsided margins far greater than the two-thirds
majority needed to override a presidential veto.
   Vice President George Bush on Monday said he would support the
Reagan veto, saying the legislation ``is imperfect and the
imperfections should be corrected.''
   Supporters of the legislation say it restores civil rights laws
to the way they were interpreted before the court challenge mounted
by tiny Grove City (Pa.) College.
   Congress had tried since the Supreme Court decision to pass a
corrective measure but became enmeshed in various controversies
involving regulation and abortion. The final bill had broad
bipartisan support and many Republicans asked the president not to
veto it.
   An eleventh-hour push by the conservative Moral Majority group
resulted in thousands of phone calls, letters and telegrams urging
lawmakers to uphold the veto.
   The liberal People for the American Way responded Monday with
newspaper ads saying ``the Far Right could defeat civil rights''
unless people call their representatives and ``tell them your tax
money must not pay for discrimination.''
   The restoration act says entire institutions and government
agencies must not discriminate if any program or activity within
them receives federal aid. Entire corporations are covered if they
provide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes to
the business as a whole, as in the Chrysler bailout.
   Farmers receiving crop subsidies, people using food stamps and
other individuals receiving federal assistance would not be subject
to regulation. An institution's refusal to perform or pay for
abortions would not be considered discriminatory.
   The Supreme Court decision applied specifically to Title IX of
the 1972 Education Amendments barring sex discrimination in
federally funded education programs. It was interpreted also to
cover the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring racial discrimination in
federally-assisted programs; the 1973 Rehabilitation Act barring
discrimination against the handicapped in any program or activity
receiving federal aid; and the 1975 Age Discrimination Act barring
employment discrimination against older people.

   U.S. troops here on an emergency
training exercise have no plans to pull out despite Nicaragua's
withdrawal of soldiers from the Honduran border, an American
military spokesman said today.
   ``Right now the plans are to make it a 10- to 14-day
exercises,'' said Maj. Gary Hovatter, public relations director for
the U.S. military in Honduras. ``We have not received any directive
as to when to begin redeployment.''
   He said training exercises between Honduran and American
soldiers would continue today at four sites, but few details were
available.
   Hovatter also said five or six of the 10 soldiers injured in a
helicopter crash during an exercise could be released to light duty.
   On Monday, he said they ``are in some pain and discomfort, but
they are handling it very well.''
   Hovatter said the helicopter, a UH-1 Huey, was flying from
southern San Lorenzo to eastern Jamastran when it hit bad weather
and was forced to divert to Juticalpa, 35 miles north of the
Nicaraguan border. It crashed about six miles south of Juticalpa in
a pine-covered valley, he said.
   Nicaragua announced Monday its troops had withdrawn from the
border, and the Honduran military reported Sandinista soldiers had
retreated. Nicaragua's Sandinista government and Contra leaders
also agreed to a cease-fire during three days of peace talks which
will end Wednesday at Sapoa on Nicaragua's southern border with
Costa Rica.
   Today, the Sandinista government proposed a 30-day cease-fire
and amnesty for rebels. The Contras proposed a 45-day truce during
which rebels would move into cease-fire zones.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benevides, the Honduran armed forces
spokesman, said Monday the 3,200 U.S. troops that rushed to
Honduras after a reported incursion by 2,000 Sandinista troops
won't be needed much longer.
   ``It'll be a very short time. We're talking days only,'' he said
in an interview.
   Also today, a U.N. fact-finding team requested by Nicaragua was
to leave for that country to investigate the border violence, the
United Nations announced in a statement. It said observations will
be limited to the Nicaragua side, since no permission was received
from Honduras to go there.
   Meanwhile, Nicaraguan and Contra officials were optimistic after
the first round of truce talks held in Nicaragua on Monday. The
talks resume today.
   ``The worst (fighting) is over and there is peace now in the
border region,'' Col. Reynald Andino Flores, commander of the
Honduran army's 101st Infantry Brigade, said Monday by telephone
from his headquarters in southern Honduras. ``We are remaining on a
state of alert to be ready for anything that may happen,'' he
added, and soldiers are ``constantly patrolling the area.''
   Flores and other officers, some of whom insisted on anonymity
for security reasons, said on Monday the Sandinistas penetrated an
area of about 20 square miles inside Olancho province while chasing
the U.S.-supported Contra rebels in a two-week offensive to evict
the Contras from Nicaragua.
   About 200 border incidents have been reported in Olancho since
the Contras began fighting the leftist Sandinista government in
1981.
   President Daniel Ortega and the Nicaraguan government have
denied Sandinista soldiers crossed the border.
   The Contras maintain camps in an area called Bocay, which
includes territory on both sides of the border. Nicaragua claims
the camps, which the Contras use to store supplies and to stage
raids inside Nicaragua, are in Nicaraguan land, but the rebels say
they are in Honduras.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras agreed to a three-day truce on
Monday, the first of three days of their latest round of peace
talks.
   At Sapoa, Nicaragua, a town on the Costa Rican border,
representatives of the Sandinista government and Contras began
their first direct talks on Nicaraguan soil. The purpose is to work
out a cease-fire as required by the peace plan that five Central
American presidents signed last Aug. 7.
   After Monday's closed session, Gen. Humberto Ortega, Nicaragua's
defense minister, said: ``The importance of today was that we
listened for the first time at the highest level their (Contras')
proposal,'' he told journalists.
   Alfredo Cesar, one of the rebel negotiators, said the Contra
plan calls for a 30-day truce, political amnesty and continued
talks to work out a lasting cease-fire. ``Neither side seeks a
military victory over the other,'' Cesar said. He called the first
round a ``step ahead.''

   The chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission today gave an ``Uncivil Rights Award'' to the mayor of
Newark, N.J., for allegedly pressuring Rep. Peter Rodino into
retirement.
   Yielding to minority constituents, Rodino, who is white and a
Democrat, announced March 14 he would not seek a 21st term in
Congress. Minorities, who make up the bulk of Rodino's district,
have clamored for several years for a minority representative.
   At a news conference, civil rights commission chairman Clarence
Pendleton, who is black, said he was awarding an ``Uncivil Rights
Award'' to Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who is also black and who,
according to Pendleton, worked ``with several other Newark
politicians'' and ``pressured ... Rodino to retire from Congress.''
   ``The notion that Peter Rodino doesn't represent the people in
the 10th District is absurd,'' Pendleton said. ``They have elected
him to Congress 20 times, and continue to support his leading role
on civil rights issues. No matter. The Newark power brokers have
decided that he is not `their' representative _ he's just the wrong
color.''
   Pam Goldstein, a spokeswoman for James, said the mayor had not
been told of the ``award.'' But Ms. Goldstein said she doubted
James' would be bothered by criticism from Pendleton, whose own
civil rights record she termed a ``joke.''
   ``I would say it's an endorsement for what the mayor's doing in
this city,'' Ms. Goldstein said.
   Rodino's press secretary, Larry Spinelli, said he would have no
immediate comment on the matter.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS' plan to liven up its schedule with a rash
of new half-hour comedies was a ratings failure in its first week.
ABC, meanwhile, put the critically praised comedy ``The Wonder
Years'' into the Nielsen top 10.
   NBC won the week handily. CBS finished slightly ahead of ABC for
the week, but continued to lag in season-to-date ratings and seems
destined to finish in last place for the first time.
   For the week ending March 20, NBC had an average, prime-time
rating of 15.8. CBS had a 12.9 and ABC 12.6. With four weeks left
in the season, NBC leads with a 16.3, ABC is second with a 13.9 and
CBS third with 13.6.
   The good news for CBS was that ``CBS Evening News'' was still in
first place with an average rating of 11.6 and a 22 share. ABC's
``World News Tonight'' was second with 10.8 and 20, and ``NBC
Nightly News'' third with 9.7 and 18.
   Of the new CBS comedies, only ``Eisenhower & Lutz,'' which
premiered with double episodes on Monday, fared very well. The
first episode ranked 41st. The second was 31st with a rating of
14.2 and a 22 share.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with television sets. The share is a percentage of sets
in use.
   The two new comedies and one returning comedy CBS added on
Tuesday night were steamrollered by ABC's normally strong lineup,
including ``The Wonder Years,'' a sweet-natured nostalgia comedy
set in the late 1960s. It replaced ``Growing Pains,'' which moved
to Wednesday night where it continues to be a top-10 show.
   The top 10 for last week were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``A
Different World'' NBC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS,
``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``The Wonder Years'' ABC,
``Night Court'' NBC, ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS and ``Growing
Pains'' ABC. Half of the top 10 shows were repeats, as the networks
began to conserve new episodes for the May sweeps.
   On Tuesday night, CBS' ``Coming of Age,'' starring Paul Dooley
as an acerbic former airline pilot struggling to adjust to a sunny
retirement village, was 59th out of 77 shows. ``My Sister Sam'' was
75th.
   ``Sam'' had originally done well in the ratings and was brought
back from hiatus to fill in for ``The Dictator,'' a new comedy that
was delayed by the Writers Guild strike.
   ``Trial and Error,'' a Hispanic ``Odd Couple,'' was 76th with a
rating of only 6.5 and an 11 share. The critically praised
``Frank's Place'' was moved from Monday to Tuesday where the rest
of the lineup dragged it down to 65th.
   NBC did well with its regular lineup and a couple of remakes of
hit movies. A new TV version of ``Inherit the Wind,'' this one
starring Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas, ranked 14th. Tied for 15th
place was ``In the Heat of the Night,'' starring Carroll O'Connor
and Howard Rollins in the pilot of the series getting a spring
tryout.
   The bottom-rated shows of the week were: ``The Thorns,'' ``A
Place at the Table,'' ``Probe,'' ``West 57th,'' ``The Disney Sunday
Movie,'' ``Ohara,'' ``Hotel,'' ``My Sister Sam,'' ``Trial and
Error'' and ``Buck James.''

Honduras, Nicaragua and the United States:

<HEAD>HONDURAS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua on Monday withdrew its soldiers from the border but
the frontier remained tense, with Honduran patrols on the lookout
for any booby traps left behind by the Sandinistas.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said the 3,200 U.S. troops sent to
Honduras last week, after the Nicaraguan army was accused of
sending 2,000 men across the border in pursuit of Contras, may not
be needed much longer.
   However, the U.S. troops were to begin a new set of joint
maneuvers with the Honduran army today. On Monday, a U.S. Army
transport helicopter crashed while participating in a military
exercise and 10 soldiers were injured. Other helicopters evacuated
the soldiers for medical treatment.

<HEAD>NICARAGUA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government, in its second day of peace talks with
Contra rebels, today proposed a 30-day truce, and the U.S.-backed
Contras said a cease-fire should last 45 days. The Nicaraguan
government proposal calls for the rebels to lay down their arms,
while the Contras said rebels should move into cease-fire zones
during the truce. On Monday, the two sides agreed to a battlefield
truce during the three days of the peace talks.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON:</HEAD>

   President Reagan today met with House Republicans in a bid to
renew interest in his stalled aid package for the Contras. The
proposed aid package would offer a one-year, $48 million infusion
of humanitarian aid, as well as continued authority for the CIA to
deliver weapons remaining in rebel inventories, estimated at as
much as $2.5 million.

   Police today found six children
reported missing when the eldest child, a 13-year-old girl, drove
out of a parking lot while their foster parents were inside a
hospital.
   The children had been left in the van Monday while the couple
kept a doctor's appointment in San Diego, San Diego police Lt. Bill
Brown said today. A witness saw the teen-ager drive the van out of
the parking lot, Brown said.
   ``Everybody's safe. Everybody's in good health,'' said police
Sgt. Ron Brown.
   Investigators from the child abuse unit were going to talk with
the children, said police spokesman Bill Robinson.
   A determination will be made if the parents were ``remiss'' in
their actions, and where the children should be placed, Robinson
said. It is unlikely that any action will be taken against the
teen-ager, he said.
   Police Sgt. Roy Stamper said the girl had driven to a friend's
home in Encinitas, a seaside community about 20 miles north of San
Diego, and the younger children spent the night in the van outside
the house.
   The mother of the friend heard a news report about the missing
van and called sheriff's deputies.
   The children's names were not released.
   The youngest child, an 8-month-old baby, was described as
``medically fragile,'' Sgt. Dan Luth said. He did not know details
of the baby's condition.
   Two of the children are age 12. The others are 4 years and 19
months.
   Police alerted authorities in San Diego County to watch for a
yellow, California-registered 1978 Chevrolet van with red, black
and orange stripes. The license number was entered into a national
computer network of stolen cars.
   It was not known if the children had any money, Luth said.
   ``As far as we know, the foster parents took all the kids to
Kaiser Hospital where the father had to see doctor,'' Brown said.
``Apparently the children wanted to stay in the van, found the key,
and drove off.''
   He said it was at first assumed the driver would take the
children to her biological parents' house in Vista, but she did not.

announced today.
   The hike is part of an overall increase in postage rates,
replacing charges that have been in effect since Feb. 17, 1985.
   The biggest increase will affect so-called ``junk'' mail, with
rates for third-class advertising increasing nearly 25 percent.
   Magazines and newspapers will pay about 18 percent more, while
postage charges for individual consumers will climb nearly 15
percent.

<HEAD>Government Closes Anti-Apartheid Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday shut
down the New Nation, a combative, church-backed anti-apartheid
newspaper, making it the first victim of a campaign to stifle
militant publications.
   The government ``has killed the messenger instead of listening
to the message.'' said Peter Soal, a Parliament member for the
liberal Progessive Federal Party.
   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha, who has state-of-emergency
powers to censor publications singlehandedly, said in a special
decree that further issues of the black-oriented weekly newspaper
are ``totally prohibited'' through June 10.
   Another Cabinet minister, Stoffel van der Merwe, said the New
Nation was closed because it advocated violent overthrow of the
government and supported communism.
   ``It is absolutely astonishing that a publication issued under
the name of a Christian organization should act in this way,'' he
said.
   The closure came a day after the 2-year-old newspaper, published
by the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, lost a court
appeal seeking to postpone government action while it challenged
the censorship regulations.
   The New Nation technically could resume publication after three
months, but Botha could close it again if its contents in the
ensuing issues dissatisfied him.
   Bishop Reginald Orsmond, chairman of the newspapers' publishing
board, said the 22-member staff would be retained during the
suspension. He declined to predict would would happen to the paper
if the suspension was extended.
   Orsmond accused the government of ``suppressing the voice of the
people.''
   Authorities have banned four of the New Nation's editions and
seized two. Police have raided the paper's offices, and it was the
first of six publications warned by Botha that they could be closed
or forced to obey an in-house censor if they continued to publish
material he found objectionable.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whose stepped-up political
activities in recent weeks have angered the government, described
the New Nation's closure as ``quite scandalous.''
   ``Only a government that is scared or already totalitarian, or
very close to totalitarian, behaves in the kind of way that ours
does,'' Tutu said.
   With a circulation of about 60,000, the New Nation is the
largest newspaper in South Africa to devote virtually its entire
content, including sports and entertainment pages, to politically
related developments.
   One regular feature was a learning section, ``to bridge the
deficiencies of apartheid education.'' In simple language, it told
readers about black activists not covered in school courses and
explained how to apply for a job, feed a baby nutritiously, treat
an injured riot victim or protect oneself from tear gas.
   The newspaper's editor, Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been detained
without charge for 16 months. He joined the New Nation after a year
as a Neiman Fellow at Harvard University.
   Sisulu's father, Walter, former secretary-general of the
now-outlawed African National Congress, is serving a life prison
term along with ANC leader Nelson Mandela for treason and sabotage.
   State-of-emergency regulations give Botha nearly unlimited
powers to deal with newspapers he feels might contribute to unrest.
Under the regulations, he does not have to give reasons for his
actions.
   The New Nation lost an initial court challenge of the
regulations and intends to pursue its case in an appellate court.
But on Monday, a Supreme Court rejected the newspaper's bid to
prevent closure during the appeal process.
   The last edition of the New Nation, on March 17, said the
government was ``bent on destroying what little freedom of
expression is left in a country where the majority are voteless.''
   ``Because the New Nation dared to act as their voice, it has now
been damned to silence,'' the paper said.
   The issue also carried a quotation from President P.W. Botha on
the front page: ``I believe in a free press and in free news
media.''

   Singer Linda Ronstadt called San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Herb Caen a ``creep'' for publishing the
address of her new home here, the newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Ronstadt, 41, recently bought the house for $2.55 million in the
city's ritzy Pacific Heights neighborhood. Although she hasn't
moved in, she is thinking about selling it.
   ``There's too much publicity about it, and it's not a good idea
to live there,'' said Ronstadt, who is on a national tour. ``It's
kind of a security risk.''
   According to the newspaper, after Caen published the address,
Ronstadt said it made her ``not like the house, and it made me not
like the neighborhood, and it made me not like the city, and it
made me not like to live there. That's the end of it.''

foreseeing a time when networks are superfluous and television news
is beamed directly into subscribers' homes.
   ``I think that the network news departments, they might not even
work for a network 10 years from now,'' said Hewitt, who produced
the the network's first television newscast, ``Douglas Edwards With

   ``There might not be any networks because it may be an outmoded

   Garrison Keillor says he's glad he's finally
getting a chance to work on a Humphrey political campaign.
   The humorist, author and former Minnesotan took to the stage
here Monday night to raise money for Minnesota Attorney General
Hubert Humphrey III, a Democrat who is challenging U.S. Sen. Dave
Durenberger, R-Minn, for his seat this year. Humphrey is the son of
the late Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey Jr.
   At a private fund-raiser after his performance, Keillor said he
had worked in several political campaigns but regretted never
having worked for the late senator and vice president.
   ``To me it feels right ... just to be able to work for a
Humphrey campaign after all these years,'' he said.
   Humphrey returned the compliment, saying ``I see in Garrison's
lighthearted, satirical humor a real sense of understanding of
where people really are.''

   Appearing on the nationwide evening newscast of the state-owned

single word, ``Oui'' _ ``Yes.''
   He said he decided to run because he thinks disunity threatened

   Prosecutors on Tuesday opened an
investigation into fraud, influence peddling and financial scandals
allegedly involving the brother of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   The Prosecutor General's Office said at least 10 officials have
been questioned in an investigation of whether Chun Kyung-hwan, a
younger brother of the former president, embezzled funds of the
Saemaul Undong development group.
   Top Saemaul officials are suspected of diverting private and
government subsidies to profit-oriented projects, land speculation
and other illegal activities.
   The former president left office Feb. 25 at the end of a
seven-year term. He left Tuesday on a private visit to the United
States, where he will meet President Reagan on Wednesday.
   President Roh Tae-woo, who succeeded Chun, has pledged to
eradicate abuses of power and corruption under previous
governments. In a recent move to reduce the ex-president's power,
Roh removed some Chun supporters from their posts.
   Some political observers say the Roh government opened the
investigation to disscredit the former president and improve the
current government's image.
   There have been allegations of corruption by the Saemaul group
since the former president seized power with military backing in
1980 and installed his brother as Saemaul head.
   The younger Chun resigned in 1987 after being linked to
gangsters.
   Prosecutor Kang Won-il said government officials also were being
investigated to see if they had assisted or protected corruption.
   ``My investigation team will unearth all malpractices and make
public the results of the probe,'' Kang told reporters.
   Dong-A Ilbo, an influential Seoul newspaper, said the younger
Chun was responsible for a sharp drop in cattle prices in 1983 when
he forced government officials to import cattle from the United
States.
   Saemaul was formed in 1971 to improve rural and urban living
standards, but critics contend the country's authoritarian
governments have used the movement to promote government influence.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy controlled by opposition
leader Kim Dae-jung charged that Roh also aided Saemaul officials
when he was a government minister in 1982.
   The opposition party demanded that Roh and other family members
of the former president be investigated.

   When asked the key question by a television reporter, Mitterrand
paused dramatically, clearly savoring the moment before delivering
his one-word answer and awaiting the reaction.
   In follow-up questions, he said he had watched the campaign, and
feared opposing candidates were bringing on France disputes that
threatened to damage the country. ``We need social peace,'' he said.
   With just four weeks remaining until the first round of voting,
Mitterrand said his decision was arrived at after mature reflection.
   The president's plans had been the subject of speculation for
months. Sometimes he had indicated he preferred to retire. Other
times he hinted he would run out of a sense of duty.

<HEAD>High Court Loosens Rules on Picketing Near Washington Embassies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Individual pickets have a right to carry signs
within 500 feet of foreign embassies in the nation's capital but
police may disperse groups of three or more protesters there, the
Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   By a vote of 8-0, the justices upheld the District of Columbia's
ban on groups demonstrating within 500 feet of embassies if police
have reason to believe the protesters pose a threat to ``the
security or peace of the embassy.''
   But by a separate 5-3 vote, the court said the city's
anti-picketing prohibition that prevents even one or two people
from carrying signs within 500 feet of the embassies violates
free-speech protections.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her opinion for the court, said
a blanket ban on signs that might be offensive to foreign diplomats
goes too far.
   ``It may serve an interest in protecting the dignity of foreign
missions, but it is not narrowly tailored,'' she said. ``A less
restrictive alternative is readily available.''
   For example, she said, it would be constitutional to ban
picketing that is designed to intimidate, coerce, threaten or
harass a foreign official.
   That type of ban has been adopted by Congress for all areas of
the nation with the exception of the District of Columbia.
   Officials of the District of Columbia government have said they
are considering adopting a law based on the congressional model.
   Tuesday's ruling allows District police to continue to enforce a
ban on demonstrations near embassies when at least three people
take part and police fear there will be disruptions.
   O'Connor said police must ``reasonably believe that a threat to
the security or peace of the embassy is present.''
   Banning such gatherings ``does not prohibit peaceful
congregations,'' she said. The ban ``is limited to groups posing a
security threat.''
   O'Connor rejected arguments that such a ban gives police too
much discretion to break up demonstrations.
   She said the test for deciding whether a demonstration is
illegal ``is whether normal embassy activities have been or are
about to be disrupted.''
   The ruling partially overturned a 1986 decision by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington upholding all aspects of the
District of Columbia's ban on protests near embassies.
   That ruling was written by former Judge Robert H. Bork, who
recently retired from the appeals court. Bork was President
Reagan's first choice to fill a Supreme Court vacancy last year but
was rejected by the Senate in a bitter fight.
   Tuesday's decision is believed to be the first time the high
court gave full review to an opinion written by Bork. His backers
during the Senate confirmation fight emphasized that he had never
been reversed by the high court.
   The appeals court ruling that Bork wrote in the embassy case
said free-speech interests of the demonstrators were outweighed by
the need to protect foreign emissaries.
   The 500-foot restrictions were challenged by Michael Boos, J.
Michael Waller and Bridget Brooker, members of the Young
Conservative Alliance of America.
   They wanted to carry signs in front of the Soviet Embassy saying
``Release Sakharov,'' referring to Soviet dissident Andrei
Sakharov, who was allowed in 1986 to return to Moscow, ending his
internal exile in the city of Gorky.
   The demonstrators also planned to picket the Nicaraguan Embassy
with placards saying ``Stop the Killing'' in opposition to the
Sandinista government there.
   The conservatives also said they were not receiving equal
treatment with opponents of the South African government who have
demonsrated near that nation's embassy in Washington.
   Many of those protesting South African racial policy have been
arrested and then freed without being prosecuted.
   Joining O'Connor in both phases of Tuesday's ruling were
Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens
and Antonin Scalia.
   Dissenting and voting to uphold the ban on individual picketing
were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White
and Harry A. Blackmun.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not take part in the decision.
   In other action, the court:
   _Unanimously ruled in a case from Michigan that states are
barred from regulating the way interstate natural gas companies
issue securities to finance their operations.
   _Heard arguments in a case from Illinois on whether the
so-called Miranda warnings police give criminal suspects are
adequate to insure their right to legal help. A decision is
expected to be announced by July.

   Kansas Democrats decided Tuesday to allow
local delegates pledged to the presidential runners-up in
Saturday's caucuses to vote at district conventions after all.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the Kansas contest with
278 of the 764 local delegates elected and Jesse Jackson finished
second with 235.
   However, there was confusion over the local delegates pledged to
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
and those who were uncommitted.
   Under state rules, local delegates who supported a candidate who
didn't reach a 15 percent threshold would be non-entities at the
district conventions April 23.
   The state decided Monday that those local delegates would be
unable to vote at the district conventions and would be ignored in
computing national delegates from the districts.
   But after conferring with the Democratic National Committee's
Compliance Commission, which interprets the national rules for
electing delegates to the national convention, the state party
decided Tuesday that all local delegates will be allowed to vote.
   Thus, the delegates pledged to Gore, Gephardt and uncommitted
could possibly form larger blocs that could secure national
delegates.
   An initial calculation by The Associated Press based on
candidates' strength at the local level showed that Dukakis won 16
national delegates, Jackson 14, Gore five and uncommitted four.
   But when peculiarities in the Kansas rules are applied, Gore and
uncommitted lack enough statewide strength to claim additional
delegates. The AP recalculation and state party count give Dukakis
18 delegates, Jackson 16, Gore three and two uncommitted.

   ``Colors,'' a movie about street gangs
starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall, could prompt more street
warfare, some officials complain.
   ``The violence was certainly graphic, but no more graphic than
on the streets,'' City Attorney James Hahn said Monday, a day after
a private screening for the film, which uses real gang members as
extras and real gang names.
   ``It portrayed the dead end of getting involved in gangs,'' Hahn
said. ``It was a pretty depressing movie from that standpoint.''
   Gang violence has claimed more than 50 lives in Los Angeles
County this year.
   The Orion Pictures movie is scheduled for release April 15, and
anti-gang specialists fear violence could erupt at theaters if
rival gang members go to see it.
   ``It could create some problems,'' Hahn said. ``It's the kind of
thing we need to be concerned about and careful. We're just going
to wait and see and monitor the situation.''
   Sheriff's Sgt. Wes McBride, president of the California Gang
Investigators Association, said ``Colors'' glorified gangs at times.
   ``I'd be surprised if we don't have some people die because of
this movie,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Hears Case Examining Adequacy of Miranda Warning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A warning advising suspects that they may
remain silent and are entitled to an attorney is not adequate to
protect their rights under the Constitution, the Supreme Court was
told on Tuesday.
   Donald Honchell, a Cook County, Ill., public defender appealing
the 1983 murder conviction of a gang member, said the ``Miranda
warning'' does protect a person from self-incrimination under the
Fifth Amendment.
   But he argued that, once a suspect is indicted, the warning
alone is not enough to protect the Sixth Amendment guarantee of
legal help.
   The Supreme Court is using the Illinois case to decide whether
the warnings that police have been required to give since 1966 are
adequate to advise suspects of their right to legal aid.
   It ruled in ``Miranda vs. Arizona'' that people accused of
crimes must be informed of their rights to remain silent, to have a
lawyer, to have counsel present during questioning and to receive
free legal assistance if needed.
   Honchell contended that even if a defendant has waived his
rights under Miranda, he has an automatic right to a lawyer as soon
as he is indicted and may not be asked from that point on to submit
to interrogation.
   ``There is a shield around the accused through which the police
cannot get a waiver,'' Honchell said. ``At no time after the
indictment should the police be allowed to go to the defendant,
seek a waiver and begin to question.''
   However, a prosecutor said authorities would be unfairly limited
if they cannot interrogate a defendant who is read his rights and
then agrees to speak without a lawyer present.
   Jack Donatelli, an assistant Cook County prosecutor, also said
the warning is perfectly understandable to defendants.
   ``They have a common-sense meaning that enables defendants to
understand they have both a right to counsel and that things could
go against them if they don't have a lawyer with them when they're
in custody and questioned,'' Donatelli said.
   Honchell said police coerced his client, Tyrone Patterson, 22,
of Evanston, Ill., into making incriminating statements by telling
him he had been indicted. But Donatelli said Patterson understood
his rights and agreed to be questioned anyway.
   Patterson, a member of the Vice Lords street gang, is serving a
24-year sentence at the Pontiac Correction Center for his
conviction in the Aug. 21, 1983 beating death of rival Black
Mobsters gang member James ``Pudge'' Jackson.
   According to court briefs, he was arrested on a misdemeanor
charge following a gang fight, received a ``Miranda warning'' and
signed a statement waiving his right to counsel.
   Two days later, after initially refusing to discuss Jackson's
death, Patterson was told he had been indicted, signed a second
Miranda waiver and agreed to answer questions, the briefs said.

   Hoosier taxpayers with a grudge can walk
into Union Station next month, pay a dollar and try to plunge an
Internal Revenue Service manager into the chilly waters of a
charity dunking booth.
   The dunking booth is part of ``Tax Bash,'' scheduled April 11-15
at the downtown train station. Proceeds from the event will benefit
the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
   During the evening hours, dry IRS employees will be on hand to
answer tax questions while their managers are taking the plunge.
H&R Block Inc. representatives will be available to prepare tax
returns, with a portion of the fee going to the MDA, and the U.S.
Postal Service will operate a special tax return drop-off box.
   ``We're billing it as one-stop shopping for taxes,'' Carolyn
Stumpf, IRS public affairs officer, said Tuesday.
   She said it didn't take any arm-twisting to get the IRS involved
in the fund-raiser.
   ``We thought that it's about time we show that we have a sense
of humor, and the fact that we can help another group of
individuals _ besides the tax-paying public _ so much the better,''
she said.

   The hot debate between mayoral and council
candidates in Parker is whether to use a 12-acre sodded area for
polo or soccer.
   ``This is the horsiest county in the United States. We have more
horses per person in our community than they do in Kentucky,'' said
Dean Salisbury, 66, mayor of this town of 700 about 15 miles
southeast of Denver.
   Voters will decide April 5 whether to retain Salisbury, the
town's first and only mayor, or replace him with one of two
challengers: Ann Waterman, 43, or Mark Lewis, 36.
   Seven people are running for the four open seats on the town
council, including three of the incumbents and four challengers.
   Salisbury, who has won ribbons as a carriage and sulky race
driver, takes credit for starting a regional park from 150 acres
dedicated to the town by developers, then cultivating about 12
acres into a low-cost ``utility field'' for soccer or softball.
   But he also hopes the grassy field can be used to host an annual
polo match to lure thousands of spectators to Parker as part of a
drive for economic development.
   The challengers say such schemes indicate Salisbury is a better
promoter than mayor and claim he has ignored the town's mundane
recreational needs.

   For years, Gayle E. Culberson has been
teaching kids at Karval High School how to make ethanol in a class
on energy conservation.
   But when the industrial arts teacher got a letter from the
Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms saying his school
would have to pay $500 a year because it was a fuel alcohol
producer, he became a little upset.
   So Culberson did what ever civics teacher recommends: he wrote
his senator.
   Culberson wrote Sen. William Armstrong that the school could not
afford the tax and could lose its permit to produce fuel alcohol.
His class makes a few quarts a year, he said.
   Without the permit, he said, students in this eastern plains
community would miss an important lesson.
   ``At a time when it seems important to reduce foreign oil
imports, reduce pollution in our states, when education is
struggling to better itself with diminishing budgets, why was there
a tax of this nature levied on fuel alcohol plants and educational
facilities in particular?'' Culberson asked Armstrong.
   Armstrong has responded by drafting an amendment that would
exempt from the tax producers who make less than 10,000 gallons of
fuel alcohol per year.
   ``This is a classic case of the bureaucracy gone berserk,''
Armstrong said.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
opponents scorned what they called a cynical offer to negotiate his
resignation and kept Panama shut down Tuesday with a general strike
intended to force him out.
   An estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by
the strike, which appeared to be gaining support on its second day.
Most shops and stores were closed, public transportation was halted
and many government employees did not go to work.
   Panama is out of cash because of pressure from the United States
to force the ouster of Noriega, who is the real power in Panama as
commander of its 15,000 soldiers and police. The U.S. dollar is the
national currency and the supply has been cut off.
   Most government workers were paid only $75 of their midmonth
wages last week and the $33 million end-of-the-month payroll for
the 130,000 public employees problably won't be met. Pension checks
due Wednesday have been delayed, at least until March 28.
   Hunger is spreading among workers as well as the poor,
unemployed and elderly. Many washerwomen, cleaning women, maids and
cooks have lost their jobs because there is no money with which to
pay them.
   Manuel Solis Palma, the civilian Noriega chose to run the
government, said on television Monday night the general would
resign in exchange for ``a national dialogue'' to reconcile
differences with opponents of the regime. He prefaced the offer
with a diatribe against the United States.
   The implication was that Noriega, under federal court indictment
in Florida on narcotics and money laundering charges, would stay in
Panama and might retain power behind the scenes.
   Calling the offer a ``noble gesture,'' Solis Palma said Noriega
pledged ``as an officer and a gentleman'' to resign before
presidential elections scheduled for May 1989.
   Solis Palma, who has the title ``minister in charge of the
presidency,'' said he would not accept Noriega's resignation unless
``all of the political forces in the country'' join ``a national
dialogue.''
   Noriega put Solis Palma in office Feb. 26, after President Eric
Arturo Delvalle tried to fire the general and the legislature
dismissed Delvalle instead.
   Delvalle, still recognized by the United States, is hiding in
Panama. His dismissal began a run on Panama's banks and they were
closed the next week.
   Pressure from Washington has included freezing virtually all
Panamanian funds in the United States, including revenue from the
Panama Canal.
   Reagan administration spokesmen rejected the Noriega proposal.
Last week, Noriega turned down a U.S. plan for him to leave Panama
and live in Spain.
   The general said his plan was a ``Panamanian solution'' to the
crisis.
   ``I have no reason to talk to the United States,'' he told
reporters after Solis Palma's speech. ``I talk to Panamanians.''
   Guillermo Cochez, vice president of the Christian Democratic
Party, said the proposed discussion would occur in a panel of 33
members, 22 of them supporting Noriega.
   ``This is not a dialogue,'' he said ``It's just cynicism.''
   Aurelio Barria said: ``The general has to go _ immediately, not
eventually.
   Barria is a leader of the National Civic Crusade, a coalition of
200 business, professional, labor and political groups that called
the general strike. It was organized last June to lead the campaign
against Noriega.
   Solis Palma spoke on television for 30 minutes, devoting all but
the last five minutes to castigating the United States. He accused
Washington of ``economic aggression'' in ``an undeclared state of
war.''
   He claimed the United States wants to renege on the 1977
treaties under which the Panama Canal will be turned over to this
country at midnight Dec. 31, 1999.
   The canal, guarded by about 10,000 U.S. troops, has been
operating normally despite the crisis. The United States sent 300
more soldiers Monday, most of them security personnel.
   Because of increasing hunger, the Rev. Francisco Verar said his
Roman Catholic church in the poor San Miguelito suburb is feeding
more families every day.
   ``If we had not done this there would have been chaos, even
cases of death,'' he said. ``We have people who have gone five, six
days without food.''
   Longshoremen, on strike for more than a week, voted
overwhelmingly Tuesday to stay out but accepted part payment of
back wages despite fears of compromising their position.
   ``There are mothers and fathers who have to feed their
children,'' said Luis Asprilla, a union leader.
   In some parts of Panama City, workers formed vigilante groups to
guard stores and other places of employment. Looting occurred
during street protests against Noriega last week.

<TEXT>
   A bladder cancer treatment that
avoids surgery has shown promising results in a preliminary study,
a scientist said Tuesday.
   Twenty-one of 36 patients who have completed the
drug-and-radiation therapy were found free of disease for three to
21 months, said George Prout, professor of surgery at Harvard
Medical School.
   Three others showed partial remission, while treatment failed
outright for nine patients. The other three were not evaluable, he
told science writers at a seminar sponsored by the American Cancer
Society.
   The study focused on patients whose cancers had invaded the
bladder muscle, a condition usually treated by surgically removing
the bladder, Prout said.
   If the bladder is removed, the patient must wear a bag to
collect urine for the rest of his life. It also essentially ends
sexual activity.
   The experimental treatment attacks liver cancer with radiation
to the pelvis, plus treatment with a mix of the drugs methotrexate,
velban and cis-platinum.

   Nearly 300,000 people have become sick and 11
have died in Shanghai's 2-month-old hepatpresses soon will
be turning out new editions of highly popular works by Mikhail
Bulgakov, author of ``The Master and Margarita,'' and Boris
Pasternak, who won the 1958 Nobel Literature Prize for his novel
``Doctor Zhivago.'' It has not yet been published in book form in
his homeland.
   The newspapers did not say whether foreign literature was
included among the books to be made available. Foreign writers such
as Jack London, Ernest Hemingway and Emile Zola are very popular in
the Soviet Union, and some have been available for years.
   No details were given on the pricing system to be used for books
published by their authors.
   ``This is not going to be a cheap venture for the author,''
Pravda warned. ``Depending on the number of copies and the volume,
such a publication will cost roughly 2,000 rubles and more.''
   That sum, the equivalent of $3,340, represents nearly a year's
pay for the average industrial worker.
   The author in return will receive 20 percent of the sales
income, Pravda said.
   The program has not yet been put into the form of law, Pravda
noted, but already state publishing houses have many applications
from authors who want to pay to see their works in print.
   By offering an alternative to creation of publishing
cooperatives, the State Publishing Committee retains a monopoly on
what gets into print.
   On a related subject, the newspaper Soviet Culture disclosed
Tuesday that GlavLit, the state body which for decades has been
responsible for censorship, is conducting a review of 6,000 books
held in ``special detention'' storehouses.
   Most of the fiction and non-fiction titles were banned during
the 29-year dictatorship of Josef V. Stalin and removed from
library shelves and book kiosks because their authors were deemed
to have espoused politically hazardous ideas.
   ``The vast majority of those books were works whose authors were
subjected to repression during the years of Stalin's personality
cult,'' Vladimir A. Solodin, a member of the review committee, told
Soviet Culture. ``The others had other `faults,' for example,
forewords written by such repressed politicians, quotes from their
works or their photographs.''
   Among the blacklisted books were 180 that contained references
to Nikolai I. Bukharin and 70 that mentioned Alexei I. Rykov, two
prominent political figures from the early years of the Soviet
government executed by Stalin but recently rehabilitated by
Gorbachev.
   GlavLit, or the Chief Directorate for the Protection of State
Secrets in Publishing, was created in 1922 to ensure freedom of the
Soviet press from ideological impurity. It has served since as the
chief censorship agency, and would have banned the blacklisted
books in the first place.
   A GlavLit committee went through 4,000 of the ba
readers, but said the review was helping to resolve the deficit in
good literature.
   The 500 books left in special detention are mostly ``profoundly
instigatory literature and nationalistic writings,'' that could be
used for ill purposes if allowed into general distribution, Solodin
said.
   The decision to keep them under wraps is not final, and the
GlavLit committee will take another look at them once the initial
screening is completed, Solodin said.

   A suspected mail thief who changed his
identity was traced to a Navy warship in the Persian Gulf and was
arrested when the ship came home, investigators said.
   Postal Inspector J.A. McDonald obtained a warrant for the arrest
of Luke Lee McCall on July 10, 1986, on a charge that he took a
letter containing a $620 insurance check from someone else's post
office box.
   McCall, who otherwise had a clean record, began using the name
of Andre Darnell Robinson in order to avoid trial, said Stan Hills,
a deputy marshal in Jacksonville. He said McCall returned to
Chicago and enlisted in the Navy.
   After several months in the Persian Gulf on the USS Okinawa,
McCall was arrested Monday in Norfolk, Va., when the vessel docked.
   With no prior record, McCall probably wouldn't have received the
maximum penalty _ five years in prison and a $250,000 fine _ had he
gone to trial in 1986, Hill said.
   McCall, 28, was ordered held on $75,000 bond following his
appearance Monday before a U.S. magistrate in Virginia.
   McCall is scheduled to be arraigned April 4 in Jacksonville on
the federal mail charge, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Teresa
Wright. He also faces additional charges stemming from the use of a
false identity, she said.
   McCall had obtained a copy of Andre Robinson's birth certificate
and was using his Social Security number, officials said. Robinson,
who lives in Jacksonville, was not involved in the scheme.
   Under his assumed name, McCall married a woman in San Diego and
bought a car with a loan from the Navy credit union there, Hills
said.

   Reyner Banham, an influential writer on
architecture and the arts, has died of cancer at the age of 66.
   The burly professor returned to London after more than 10 years
in the United States after developing cancer last year. He died
Saturday in London, his family said.
   Most recently, Banham taught art history at the University of
California for seven years.
   He was educated in Norwich, and at the beginning of World War
II, he began working at the Bristol Aeroplane Co. After the war, he
studied art history at London University's Courtauld Institute
while writing about contemporary architecture for The Architectural
Review.
   In 1959, he joined the staff of the review full-time, but five
years later, left for a teaching post at Bartlett University
College in London, where in 1969 he became professor of the history
of architecture.
   After enthusiastic U.S. reaction to his 1960 book, ``Theory and
Design in the First Machine Age,'' he moved to the United States in
1966 to teach at the University of Buffalo in New York. He moved to
California in 1980.
   He wrote two other widely studied books, ``The New Brutalism''
in 1966 and ``Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment'' in
1969.
   Banham is survived by his wife, Mary, a son and a daughter.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Chairman Blasts Newark Mayor's `Uncivil Rights'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission announced Tuesday that he was bestowing an ``Uncivil
Rights Award'' on the mayor of Newark, N.J., for pressuring Rep.
Peter Rodino, D-N.J., to retire because he is white.
   Chairman Clarence Pendleton, who is black, said that Rodino
receives the ``Victim of Uncivil Rights Award'' for the way in
which he was treated by ``Newark power brokers'' who have decided
that ``he is not their representative _ he's just the wrong color.''
   At a news conference where he criticized the Civil Rights
Restoration Act and the resignation under pressure of Gallaudet
University President Elisabeth Zinser, Pendleton said he was
instituting his own personal ``Uncivil Rights Award'' program in an
effort to highlight ``the absurdities committed in the name of
civil rights.''
   Pendleton's first recipient was Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who
is black. James has said the courts carved out Rodino's 10th
Congressional District more than 12 years ago to elect a minority
congressman, and that ``it's time to get that done.'' Pendleton
said James worked ``with several other Newark politicians'' in
pressuring Rodino to retire.
   Rodino announced March 14 that he would not seek a 21st term in
Congress. Minorities, who make up the bulk of Rodino's district,
have clamored for several years for a minority representative.
   ``Rodino has been pressured to retire so that a proper _ read
this black _ representative can be elected,'' said Pendleton. ``The
notion that Peter Rodino doesn't represent the people in the 10th
District is absurd. They have elected him to Congress 20 times, and
continue to support his leading role on civil rights issues.''
   James declined to respond to the criticism from Pendleton, said
Pam Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the mayor. ``I will not dignify
his comments with a response,'' she quoted James as saying.
   Rodino also declined comment, said spokesman Larry Spinelli.
   Pendleton said he would bestow his new awards ``as often as they
are properly earned _ perhaps once a month. If the Civil Rights
Restoration Act passes today over the president's veto, I suppose I
will have more than enough material.''
   Pendleton said the Civil Rights Restoration Act represents ``an
unwarranted invasion ... by Big Brother.''
   The statute forbids distribution of federal funds to entire
institutions, state and local government agencies and many
corporations if any part of them practices discrimination. It was
spurred by a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that civil rights laws
applied only to a specific program or activity receiving federal
aid.
   The head of the civil rights panel also said that one of his
candidates for a ``Victim of Uncivil Rights'' Award had been
Zinser, who was named the first woman president in the 124-year
history of Gallaudet University for the deaf, only to resign
following protests over the fact that she was not deaf.

<HEAD>Test-Tube Baby Pioneer Dies At 74</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Steptoe, the doctor who delivered the
world's first test-tube baby in 1978 and helped pioneer a technique
that revolutionized infertilty treatment, has died of cancer. He
was 74.
   Steptoe, a gynecologist and obstetrician who pioneered the in
vitro fertilization technique with physiologist Robert Edwards,
died Monday night at Chaucer Hospital in Canterbury.
   On Tuesday, he was to have been decorated by Queen Elizabeth II
as a Commander of the British Empire, an honor one step below a
knighthood, for services to his country.
   An expert in infertility, Steptoe also was to have received the
British Medical Association's Gold Medal, one of the profession's
highest awards, at its annual meeting in July.
   ``Mr. Steptoe made an invaluable contribution to medicine and
raised the honor and dignity of the profession,'' the association
said. British surgeons use the designation ``Mr.'' instead of
``Dr.''
   The test-tube baby technique gave hope to millions of childless
couples and spawned a range of fertility treatments for both men
and women.
   More than 1,000 test-tube babies have been born as a result of
treatment at Bourn Hall Clinic, near Cambridge, run by Steptoe and
Edwards, and thousands of others have born elsewhere in the world.
   ``It is a very great loss to Bourn Hall and to me personally,''
Edwards said. ``In the last three years, he was working under
considerable difficulties but carried on.
   ``He wished to do service to his patients for as long as
possible.''
   Truck driver John Brown, father of Louise Joy Brown, the world's
first test-tube baby, said he and his wife, Lesley, ``are forever
in his debt.''
   ``There is no way we, or any other couples Mr. Steptoe helped,
can possibly repay him for what he has given them,'' Brown said.
   Louise was born on July 25, 1978, in Oldham, England. Four years
later, the Browns had a second test-tube baby, Natalie Jane.
   The birth of Louise Brown, the first human conceived outside the
womb, was hailed as a medical breakthrough on the order of the
first heart transplant. But some people were horrified, seeing it
as the dawn of a ``Brave New World'' of baby farms and genetic
engineering.
   ``I am not a wizard or a Frankenstein,'' Steptoe once said.
   ``All I want to do is help women whose child-producing mechanism
is slightly faulty.''
   Under the in vitro fertilization technique, which actually
involves no test tubes, eggs are removed from the prospective
mother and fertilized with the intended father's sperm in a glass
dish. The resulting embryo is then implanted in the mother's womb.
   It took 10 years for Edwards and Steptoe to develop the
technique.
   Working at Cambridge University, Edwards worked out the
procedure for fertilizing eggs in a laboratory dish, and Steptoe
adapted a technique known as laparoscopy, a way of seeing and
operating inside the abdomen by inserting a tube with a fiber optic
light.
   Originally intended for women who were unable to conceive
because of blocked Fallopian tubes, in vitro fertilization has
given rise to such procedures as embryo freezing, egg and sperm
donation, embryo transfer and surrogate motherhood.
   Steptoe, who was born on June 9, 1913, qualified as a doctor in
1939 and immediately went into World War II service as a Royal Navy
surgeon. He was a prisoner of war in Italy from 1941 to 1943, and
was discharged with the rank of surgeon lieutenant commander in
1946.
   He worked as an obstetrician in state hospitals, moving in 1951
to Oldham, a northern England city where in the fall of 1967 he
teamed up with Edwards.
   In 1984, a furor erupted over allegations that they had
experimented on embryos, although the scientists later insisted
they had only observed embryos.
   The same year, the team proposed implanting embryos into animals
to determine whether some conditions favorable to fertility exist
in the animal's uterus but not in a woman's. The idea eventually
was dropped.
   But Steptoe said he and Edwards never thought their work was in
any way unethical. ``We are not creating life,'' he said. ``We have
merely done what many people try to do in all kinds of medicine _
to help nature.''
   Steptoe said the greatest contribution of their work would
likely be in early embryo research into genetic diseases.
   He is survived by his wife, Sheena, and a son and daughter.
Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Car Dealer's Lions Raises Art Institute Roar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car salesman didn't think he'd be stepping on
any paws when he put a pair of seven-foot lion statues on the roof
of his auto dealership and advertised ``The Car Institute.''
   But a roar of sorts erupted from the Art Institute of Chicago,
which has lions guarding its entrance.
   ``I didn't think people would be confused,'' said Joe Levy Jr.,
the car dealer, who said Tuesday he had agreed to a compromise. ``I
don't know how much of their traffic we've been getting. I think
there's room for both of us.''
   The Art Institute contended ads for the ``Car Institute''
violated a museum trademark.
   ``We agreed to discontinue the `Car Institute,''' Levy said.
``But they've agreed to let us keep the lions'' on the building in
Evanston.
   Robert Mars, the Art Institute's vice president for
administrative affairs, said the advertising was the real problem.
To allow Levy to capitalize on the institution's image might allow
others to do the same, and in an offensive way, Mars said.
   ``I think it maybe sends a signal out to people who
all-too-frequently try to use images from our collection that
aren't terribly appropriate,'' he said.
   Mars said a mistake was made long ago when the museum did not
protect its copyright of the painting ``American Gothic'' by Grant
Wood. ``Now we can no longer say anything about how'' parodies use
the stern-faces farm couple, Mars said.
   Levy said he got the call from the museum attorney about a month
ago. Last week he had his fiberglass lions painted the colors of
nearby Northwestern University ``to help clear up the confusion.''
One is now white, the other purple.
   ``We hope they don't object,'' he said.
   Mars said the lions, even in purple and white, can stay.

<HEAD>Four Palestinians Ordered Expelled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Palestinians who had sought
political asylum in Sweden were ordered expelled Tuesday for
undisclosed security reasons, a government official said.
   The order came after Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson's government
met in a special session to consider their appeal against a ruling
by police and immigration authorities that they leave the country,
said Erik Lempert, a senior official of the Labor Ministry.
   A fifth Palestinian was granted a resident's visa for
humanitarian reasons, despite objections by the National Security
Police, Lempert said.
   He said the government normally granted asylum to stateless
Palestinians arriving from Lebanon since the 1982 Israeli invasion
of that country, but police objections ``weighed heavier'' in these
cases.
   One of the four was married to a Swedish woman expecting their
child in April.
   Lempert declined to specify the suspicions against the
Palestinians. Lawyers representing them were ordered not to
comment, but the attorneys were quoted by the national news agency
TT as saying they would appeal.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with new Dole comment, subbing 2 grafs for 3rd graf

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole
campaigned in Wisconsin on Tuesday rather than return to Washington
for the Senate override vote of President Reagan's veto of civil
rights legislation, saying ``I wasn't needed.''
   Dole indicated both opposition and support for Reagan's veto of
the civil rights bill in a confusing series of statements.
   On a radio call-in show, Dole said he would vote to override the
veto if he were in Washington. But he added, ``If it were the
deciding vote, I would side with the president.''
   He later elaborated, saying the only reason he would vote to
sustain Reagan's veto would be to ``give (the White House) a chance
to rework the bill.'' In a speech to Milwaukee businessmen, Dole
said, ``That bill is not nearly as bad as advertised.''
   In Washington, his spokeswoman also issued a double-edged
statement. Dale Tate said Dole, Republican leader in the Senate,
``opposes the president on this issue'' and would like to reverse
the Supreme Court ruling that prompted the legislation. But she
said, ``If his vote were needed to sustain the veto, he would.''
   ``In principle he opposes the president,'' she said.
   The Democratic-controlled Senate had more than enough votes to
provide the two-thirds majority needed to override Reagan's veto,
with or without Dole, who was campaigning in Wisconsin in advance
of the state's April 5 Republican presidential primary.
   Vice President George Bush, the faraway front-runner for the GOP
nomination, announced on Monday that he supported Reagan's veto.
``I'm not going to start differing with the president after 7 1@2
years into the vice presidency,'' he said.
   Dole was criticized by Bush earlier in the campaign for failing
to take a clear-cut position on key issues such as tax increases
and arms control.
   And a variety of statements by Dole and allies left a confused
impression on the hotly debated civil rights bill.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, the GOP Senate whip, said he had been
authorized to say on the Senate floor that ``were he (Dole) present
and voting, he would vote to sustain the president's veto.''
   Dole himself issued a statement for the record which did not say
how he would vote.
   ``I have always supported legislation to overturn Grove City to
restore the broad civil rights coverage that existed prior to that
case,'' he said.
   ``At the same time, I recognize that (the Grove City bill) is
not a perfect bill. I am not fully satisfied with it... But the
fact remains that the administration and its congressional allies
had the opportunity to offer amendments and they were voted down.''
   The legislation stems from a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that says
that an organization receiving federal aid must follow
anti-discrimination rules only for the program that receives the
aid, and not for the entire organization or institution.
   The legislation would erase that distinction and require that an
entire organization follow the rules. Dole was absent when the
Senate passed the bill in January. Reagan vetoed the bill, saying
it was too broad and infringed on the activities of religious
groups, small buisnesses and others.
   Civil rights groups have strongly suppored the bill and favor
overriding Reagan's veto.

Army Europe.
   The president also nominated Lt. Gen. Thurman D. Rodgers for
assignment as commander of the Army Information Systems Command,
the Pentagon continued. He would replace Lt. Gen. Emmett Paige Jr.,
57, has held the post since July 1984 and is retiring on Aug. 1
after more than 40 years' service.
   Rodgers, 53, a native of Cookeville, Tenn., now is director for
information systems on the staff of the Army secretary.
   Maj. Gen. Bruce R. Harris would be promoted to lieutenant
general and to replace Rodgers in the staff position. Harris, 53, a

   The Soviet Union on Tuesday increased official
pressure on Armenia and Azerbaijan to halt ethnic unrest that has
left at least 32 people dead.
   The Tass news agency said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of
the Russian federation, the nation's largest republic, and
equivalent bodies in the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Georgia and
Uzbekistan called on the national parliament to take firm action to
end the tension.
   The moves came amid increasingly negative coverage in the
official press of Armenian demands to annex the predominantly
Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is part of neighboring
Azerbaijan and the reported arrest of a leading Armenian
nationalist.
   Tamara Grigoryants, wife of Armenian-born dissident Sergei
Grigoryants, said in an interview that Paryur Arikyan was arrested
Tuesday evening by three policemen in central Moscow after meeting
with a Western journalist.
   She said Arikyan was accused of crossing the street illegally,
and that he informed her of his arrest by calling from a pay
telephone as the policemen stood by. Arikyan said Saturday he had
traveled clandestinely to Moscow after his passport was confiscated
in Armenia.
   The government newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday criticized Armenian
activists who it said gathered almost 4,000 people for a meeting in
Yerevan on March 19 to devise strategy to press their demands.
   On Monday the Communist Party newspaper Pravda charged the
Armenians' campaign has a ``clear anti-socialist spirit.''
   Ethnic rioting broke out in Sumgait, a Azerbaijani city, after
Armenians began protesting last month for annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh. Officials say 32 people were killed, but Armenian
activists say the death toll was much higher and that most of the
dead were Armenians killed by Azerbaijanis.
   The Russian federation expressed ``concern and alarm'' over the
ethnic unrest and asked the Presidium of the national Supreme
Soviet, the country's nominal parliament, to ``adopt resolute
measures aimed at ... uniting in all ways the Soviet peoples.''
   The Soviet constitution says little about the rights of
autonomous regions such as Nagorno-Karabakh, but says the territory
of a republic such as Azerbaijan or Armenia may not be changed
without its consent. That means Azerbaijan would have to approve
the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.
   Under Soviet law, each of the country's 15 republics is
ostensibly sovereign. But the appeals from the five Soviet
republics about Nagorno-Karabakh seemed designed to serve as a
reason for the national government in Moscow to act on the
simmering territorial dispute.
   The policy-making Central Committee of the Communist Party
rejected the demand for annexation on Feb. 20, but Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised on Feb. 26 that the issue would be
considered when the Central Committee holds another meeting to
discuss national disputes.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a regular
news briefing that protests continued in Armenia on Sunday and
Monday. A nationalist source said Armenians would gather again in
their capital of Yerevan on Saturday to decide whether to call a
general strike.
   Gerasimov said the situation in Azerbaijan and Armenia still is
too tense to allow foreign journalists to travel there.
   ``A curfew is still in effect in Sumgait, although the situation
there is regarded as absolutely normal,'' Gerasimov said. ``In
Armenia I wouldn't call it normal because there are demonstrations
going on and that's not normal.''
   Arikyan told The Associated Press on Monday that 7,000 people
had gathered in Yerevan to protest the Pravda article published
earlier that day criticizing the movement to annex Nagorno-Karabakh.
   At a Tuesday news conference in Moscow before his reported
arrest, Arikyan, 38, a former political prisoner, read what he said
was the text of a telegram from Armenian journalist Y. Arakyelan to
Pravda Editor Viktor G. Afanasyev.
   According to Arikyan, the correspondent said the article was an
``editor's article expressing the will of the Communist Party
Central Committee,'' rather than the views of those whose names
were attached to it.
   Arikyan, chairman of an Armenian nationalist group called
Alliance for National Determination, said the Pravda article was an
indication that authorities will not agree to unite
Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, despite appeals from local Communist
Party and government officials.
   Arikyan once headed an underground Armenian nationalist group
called the National Unification Party, and was jailed for 17 years
beginning in 1969 for his political activities.
   He said Armenian activists in Yerevan claim 78 people were
killed in Sumgait. But, he said, ``I think a worse tragedy than
Sumgait awaits us.''

<HEAD>China Representative in Hong Kong Praises `Modern Capitalism'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist China's chief representative in Hong
Kong was quoted Tuesday as praising modern capitalism as a ``great
creation of human civilization.''
   Xu Jiatun's comments appeared in the pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po
newspaper, which ran the text of an interview he gave with a
Chinese magazine, and appeared aimed at boosting confidence in Hong
Kong after 1997, when China takes over the capitalist territory.
   ``We have some comrades who always fear capitalism, but in fact
they don't understand that the modern capitalist system is a great
creation of human civilization,'' said Xu, who as head of the
Xinhua News Agency branch is China's chief representative in Hong
Kong.
   The Xinhua official was quoted as saying China ``should
systematically absorb the beneficial experience and knowledge from
modern capitalism,'' which he praised for guaranteeing an
enivronment of free competition, allowing production forces to
develop, and creating a good legal system.
   ``In the past, we believed capitalism would quickly die out,''
Xu was quoted as saying. ``Looking from today's perspective, modern
capitalism has a lot of room to develop.''
   China's Communist Party last year reaffirmed its commitment to
opening up the country and pushing market-oriented reforms to
stimulate the economy.
   Xu's comments not only indicated strong support for reform but
also appeared designed to allay fears about what will happen to
this bastion of capitalism after China takes over in 1997.
   Much of Hong Kong's well-educated middle class are seeking to
move overseas before the territory reverts to Chinese rule, even
though Beijing has promised the territory can retain its capitalist
economic system and enjoy ``a high degree of autonomy.''
   But many of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people are refugees from
political campaigns in Communist China and remain pessimistic. Xu
acknowledged they have ``a kind of distrust of the Communist Party,
which is completely understandable.''
   He said residents will be allowed to criticize the Communist
Party and socialism after 1997, but will be asked to ``love China
and love Hong Kong.''
   ``This is what we call `one country, two systems,''' Xu was
quoted as saying. ``This will benefit China's cooperation with
every circle of people in Hong Kong, especially the middle class.''

   The bill, which was sent to the Senate, extends the so-called
``orphan drug'' program through fiscal 1990. It would also expand
the program, which is overseen by the Food and Drug Administration,
to include special devices and foods needed to help people with
unusual maladies.
   Under the program, companies are given tax credits and
seven-year exclusive marketing rights if they develop products for
rare diseases. Without incentives, the companies would not pursue
development of those products because the small number of
beneficiaries would not make it profitable, according to supporters
of the legislation.
   The revised statute, while expanding the program, would triple
its cost in the next few years. The current annual authorization of
$4 million would grow to $14 million in fiscal 1990.
   The Reagan administration has said it has no objection to the
legislation.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the health subcommittee
of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, had also sought to
include a provision to limit profits on orphan drugs. However, the
restrictions were opposed by the pharmaceutical industry and Waxman
dropped them rather than face possible stalling tactics when the
bill reached the Senate.
   The only dissenting vote was cast by Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill.

<HEAD>Toshiba Fined in Soviet Machinery Sales Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Tuesday fined Toshiba Machine Co.
$15,750 for illegally selling sensitive technology to the Soviet
Union, and ordered suspended sentences for two former Toshiba
Machine executives.
   Tokyo District Court Judge Toshio Yonezawa found that Toshiba
Machine's actions ``seriously damaged the economic activities,
foreign relations and trade policies of our nation, which is trying
to protect free trade and international cooperation.''
   Between 1982 and 1984, Toshiba Machine, a subsidiary of Toshiba
Corp., Japan's second-largest electronics maker, sold $17 million
in sophisticated milling machines to the Soviet Union, part of them
allegedly through Norway's state-owned Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk.
U.S. officials alleged the machines helped Moscow build propellers
that make submarines quieter and harder to detect.
   Since the statute of limitations on that action had expired,
however, the current case involved charges that parts and software
were sold later in violation of foreign trade and exchange laws
based on the regulations of the Western allies' Coordinating
Committee for Exports to Communist Nations.
   The defense argued that the machine parts and software could
have been produced by the Soviet Union and there had been no
violation worthy of serious legal consideration.
   But Yonezawa said, ``The violation cannot be dismissed as
trivial, since it involved misleading explanations made by Toshiba
Machine officials to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry and the destruction of related papers after the incident
was uncovered.''
   Yonezawa added that Toshiba Machine's actions ``fed distrust of
the Japanese government and industry in the United States.''
   He held that the sale occurred ``with the approval of the
company's president and under the direction of the corporation's
top executives.''
   Hiroaki Tanimura, former deputy senior project manager of the
company's First Engineering Department, was sentenced to one year
in prison, with the sentenced suspended for three years.
   Ryuzo Hayashi, a former manager in Toshiba Machine's Material
Supply Division, was sentenced to 10 months in prison, also
suspended for three years.
   Following the decision, Joichi Aoi, president of Toshiba Corp.,
told reporters, ``The Toshiba Group has been taking the utmost
efforts to assure that no such incident will recur, and there will
be no change in this policy in the future.''
   Earlier, in the milling machine case, the Japanese government
banned Toshiba Machine from exporting to any communist nations for
one year.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Funds For Reagan And President-Elect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill authorizing $3.5 million in
transitional expenses for President Reagan's successor and $1
million for Reagan to move to retirement in California next January
was approved Tuesday by the House Government Operations Committee.
   The Democratic-controlled committee rejected a Republican move
to increase the expense allowance for the outgoing president to
$1.5 million from $1 million, the level in effect since 1976, to
offset the effects of inflation.
   The proposed boost was opposed by Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the
panel's chairman, who said the budget squeeze requires Congress to
``make some hard choices'' on spending cuts.
   The panel approved raising the president-elect's allowance for
transitional expenses to $3.5 million from $2 million, the level in
effect for the past 12 years. It also rejected, 24-9, a move by
Rep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., to forbid the president-elect from
accepting private donations to supplement federal transitional
funds.
   The $1 million for Reagan's initial retirement expenses, if
approved by the House and Senate, would cover his moving expenses
from the White House to California and the costs of establishing an
office for six months, until funds for former presidents become
available under a separate law.

   The military services had no problem meeting
their recruiting goals last last year, but there were ``some
adverse signs'' for the future in lower re-enlistment results, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Releasing its latest quarterly report, the Defense Department
said the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps signed up 66,300
recruits during the first quarter of fiscal 1988, which ended Dec.
31.
   That compares with a combined goal of 65,400, and all four
services met or exceeded their individual quarterly objectives, the
Pentagon said.
   Moreover, the percentage of first-time enlistees with a high
school diploma actually increased slightly _ from 92 percent during
the period in fiscal 1987 to 93 percent in fiscal 1988.
   ``Retention (re-enlistment) results for the first quarter of
fiscal 1988 were also satisfactory, but with some adverse signs,''
Grant S. Green Jr., assistant defense secretary for manpower, said
in a statement.
   ``First-term re-enlistment rates trailed comparable fiscal 1987
statistics for three of the four services. And while overall career
retention rates showed some improvement over fiscal 1987, retention
among second-term and career Navy petty officers continued to
decline after falling short of objectives last year.''
   The Pentagon pays particular attention to the percentage of men
and women willing to re-enlist after completing their initial
obligation, viewing it as a measure not only of military readiness
and experience in the force but also job satisfaction.
   According to the latest report, 46 percent of military personnel
eligible to re-enlist for the first time during the period did so _
down from 49 percent during the comparable period in fiscal 1987.
   Some of the individual service declines, however, were much more
precipitous. For example, the Air Force's first term re-enlistment
rate dropped from 74 percent to 62 percent over the year.
   The Marine Corps' rate dropped from 24 percent to 18 percent,
and the Navy's rate fell from 56 percent to 51 percent. The Army
managed to buck the trend with a small increase, from 40 percent in
fiscal 1987 to 43 percent this fiscal year.
   Green noted that various re-enlistment bonus programs had been
suspended for 65 days during the period awaiting congressional
action.
   ``But most retention measures have fallen several percentage
points below their 1983-84 peaks, and this trend has been
particularly noticeable among personnel in higher-technology skills
that are in particular demand in the private sector,'' he added.
   Meanwhile, Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, restated
the administration's strong opposition to a cut in the 4.3 percent
pay raise proposed for military personnel in fiscal 1989, which
begins Oct. 1.
   The 4.3 percent hike exceeds the 2 percent proposed for civilian
government workers and some congressional leaders are now arguing
military and civilian workers should be treated the same.
   ``The comparability studies ... show an 11 percent gap between
military and civilian pay,'' Howard said. ``The 4.3 percent pay
raise is fully justified unless we want to return to the situation
that we saw in the past where the disparity was so great that good
people couldn't afford to stay in the military.''

<HEAD>Plant May Reduce Liver Cancer in Hepatitis Virus Carriers, Study
Suggests^

used in study.</HEAD>
<NOTE>For release at 6 p.m. EST.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Extracts of a tropical plant appeared
to reduce levels of hepatitis virus and liver cancer rates in
woodchucks, a hopeful sign for the world's 200 million human
virus-carriers at risk for the cancer, a scientist said Tuesday.
   The trends emerged in analysis of data on about 60 animals that
had become infected with the woodchuck version of the hepatitis B
virus, said Baruch Blumberg of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in
Philadelphia. Woodchucks are used in hepatitis research because the
virus they carry so closely resembles the human hepatitis B virus.
   Blumberg stressed that the results are only suggestive, and a
prelude to a formal study of the plant extract's effects.
   ``Even if it doesn't get rid of the virus altogether, it may
still be useful,'' he said after speaking to science writers at a
seminar sponsored by the American Cancer Society.
   That is because the virus now can lie dormant for decades after
infection, and if the extract can extend that period, it may
essentially block the progression to liver cancer until after a
person has died of something else, he said.
   Infection with hepatitis virus B has long been linked to later
development of cancer originating in the liver, as opposed to
cancer that starts elsewhere in the body and spreads to the liver.
   Studies in Taiwan have found that male carriers of the virus run
more than 200 times the risk of developing liver cancer than
non-carriers, giving them a 40 percent chance of dying from the
disease, Blumberg said.
   The cancer is particularly common in Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa, he said. In the United States, the cancer society expects
about 6,000 new cancers of the liver this year.
   The best way to deal with the problem is vaccination at birth
for people at risk of the disease, Blumberg said. Such a vaccine is
not recommended for the American population generally because the
overall risk is so low, he said.
   China and Taiwan have programs for vaccinating newborn children,
he said. His institution has established a vaccine program in
Philadelphia directed at newborn children of carrier mothers and
others in their household. He said he hopes other such programs
will be established.
   But the world already has about 200 million carriers of the
virus, and more will be added every day until vaccination programs
become fully effective, he said.
   The plant, called Phyllanthus ammarus, grows in India and
throughout the tropical world, Blumberg said. It can be grown in
the United States, he said.
   The extract of the plant appears to fight the virus by blocking
a substance called DNA polymerase that the virus needs to reproduce
itself, he said.
   When the extract was injected into the bellies of woodchucks
infected for a month, evidence of the virus disappeared, he said.
Those infected longer showed decreases in the amount of virus in
their blood.
   Treated animals also developed significantly fewer liver cancers
than others, Blumberg said.
   Limited studies in animals suggest the extract does not cause
significant side effects, he said. Scientists are trying to isolate
the portion of the extract that fights the virus, he said.
   Raymond Koff, a liver disease specialist and professor of
medicine at Boston University, said the work should be followed up
with more study. ``Innovative, exciting stuff has to be looked
at,'' he said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Gas Distributor In Fatal Explosion Issues Nationwide Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gas distribution company has
warned customers nationwide that cylinders of silane gas may have
been contaminated the same way as one that exploded, killing three
people, officials said Tuesday.
   Liquid Carbonic Industries Corp. of Chicago issued the warning
Monday that the cylinders of silane may have been contaminated with
an unstable oxidizer, said Dewey Erzinger, the company's director
of public relations.
   Erzinger said he could not estimate the number Liquid Carbonic
customers across the country, but said most are in the electronics
industry. The company manufactures industrial and medical gases,
such as silane, which is widely used to coat silicon wafers.
   Erzinger said company officials are investigating the origin of
the cylinder that exploded Thursday at the Gollob Analytical
Services plant, killing three people and seriously injuring a
fourth.
   The state Department of Environmental Protection has tentatively
traced the cylinder _ believed to contain a volatile mixture of
nitrous oxide and silane _ through three states before it reached
Berkeley Heights.
   The exact cause of the blast remains unknown, say officials with
the DEP and Liquid Carbonics.
   In its note to its customers, Liquid Carbonic said the explosion
may have been caused by some kind of oxidizer being drawn back into
the cylinder.
   ``If your process utilizes silane gas product in conjunction
with oxidizers, such as nitrous oxide or oxygen, you are urged to
make certain that oxidizers cannot be drawn back into your silane
gas container,'' the notice said.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, Liquid Carbonic completed removal of 300
cylinders of silane from its Harrison plant, Erzinger said. He said
the company may conduct similar removals at other plants around the
country.
   On Monday, nearly 1,000 workers were held off their jobs on the
San Francisco Peninsula after canisters containing potentially
explosive chemicals were discovered at semiconductor facilities
there.
   Chemical inspectors eventually concluded that the four canisters
at Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in Santa Clara and Teledyne
Semiconductor in Mountain View were harmless.
   A similar precautionary evacuation took place Sunday in
Pocatello, Idaho, when officials of the Gould Inc.'s semiconductor
plant examined silane cylinders belonging to Liquid Carbonic.
   One of the men killed in Thursday's blast, Dennis Feeney, was a
regional manager for Liquid Carbonic at the company's Harrison
facility. The two others killed were Gollob employees.
   A Liquid Carbonic deliveryman, James Diemer, lost a leg and
suffered shrapnel wounds. He was in fair condition Tuesday in the
plastic surgery ward of Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. got the meeting he'd
sought with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo on Monday, but he got no
endorsement for his presidential bid despite complimentary words
from the governor.
   ``He's very bright,'' Cuomo said of Gore. ``He's very deep in
his knowledge of government. ... He has a particular kind of appeal
that's especially attractive to the Democratic Party at this
moment.''
   But Cuomo said he and Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine are not ready to
publicly back a candidate. He said of Gore, ``It was nice of him to
come by.'' But he added that during their private meeting at the
state Capitol, ``Sen. Gore said nothing that I haven't heard him
say before.''
   Gore had tried to arrange a meeting with Cuomo early last month
in Albany but couldn't. Cuomo said Gore had asked to stop at the
Capitol again Monday as part of a campaign trip through New York in
advance of the state's April 19 primary. Gore also campaigned in
Connecticut Monday.
   ``Of course, I asked for his support and we talked about his
desire to play the most constructive role possible in helping the
country and helping the Democratic party win a victory in
November,'' Gore said. The Tennessee senator said they also
discussed problems New York and other states are wrestling with
such as housing, the homeless and AIDS.
   Gore rose to third place in the battle for nominating delegates
by winning five Southern states in the Super Tuesday primaries on
March 8.
   Cuomo said the Democratic race between front-runners Michael
Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Gore has created a ``confused picture
politically.''
   ``We're _ Stan Lundine and I _ now accelerating the process of
trying to determine how best to be useful to the Democratic
Party,'' Cuomo said. ``Maybe we'll go beyond that and endorse
somebody. We'll know within a couple of weeks.''
   The fact that Cuomo has yet to endorse any Democratic candidate,
coupled with his refusal to rule out accepting a draft for the
nomination if there should be a deadlocked national convention, has
kept alive the speculation that he might be angling for the
nomination. Howver, Cuomo says he is not a candidate for president
this year.
   Later Gore, in a quick swing through Connecticut, predicted he
would do well in the state's Democratic presidential primary next
Tuesday despite Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' strong regional
appeal here.
   ``I'm extremely optimistic that we're going to do very well
here, in spite of the fact that it's in the backyard of one of my
opponents,'' Gore said during a brief stop at an office building
construction site outside of Hartford.
   ``We're going to surprise some people here,'' Gore said.
   Gore expressed hope that Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill
would make an endorsement soon, rather than remaining uncommitted
until the Democratic convention in Atlanta in July.
   ``I'd love to have the governor's endorsement and I've asked him
for his support,'' Gore said. ``But I certainly understand why he
wants to take a close look at the race and think about it some
more.''
   Gore praised O'Neill lavishly, calling him ``a tremendous
leader'' who's done ``an outstanding job as governor.''

<HEAD>Reagan Refuses To Discuss North Pardon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan refused Monday to discuss a
possible pardon for former White House aide Oliver North, and a
presidential spokesman said North's lawyer had not contacted the
administration about the matter.
   In response to a reporter's question at the end of a ceremony to
sign an Afghanistan Day proclamation, Reagan replied, ``Not going
to discuss that now.''
   Separately, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater repeated the
administration's oft-stated position that ``there's been no
discussions of pardons.''
   He also said that the administration has not been contacted by
North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, who has been saying publicly
that testimony may be sought from the highest officials of
government.
   ``The president will cooperate but we'll just have to wait and
see what the format takes,'' Fitzwater said.
   North was indicted last week by a federal grand jury on charges
he conspired to divert Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   Earlier Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Reagan should pardon
North. He said North had been guilty of misleading Congress but did
not intend to break the law.
   ``I continually ask the question, where's the venality, where's
the corruption, where's the criminal intent?'' Hatch said on ``CBS
This Morning.'' ``I don't think anybody who watched Oliver North
believes that he intended to break the law or that he intended to
be a criminal.''
   Asked if North had misled Congress, Hatch said, ``That's true.
But keep in mind Oliver North saw his buddies get killed in
Lebanon. He found the terrorists who had killed them through leaks.
... He was the fellow who helped plan the the Grenada invasion. He
was the fellow who captured the Achille Lauro terrorists through
leaks.''
   ``You go on right down the line. ... I think that he was a hero
then, he's a hero today and I think we ought to get this behind us
and I think a pardon would be the appropriate way to do that,''
Hatch said.
   However, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., who also served on the
committees that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, said the
courts should decide the guilt or innocence of North and former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter, who also was indicted.
   ``For the president to pre-emptively pardon them in advance I
think would send a terrible signal to the country about the
even-handedness and objectivity of our legal system. Remember they
are all assumed innocent,'' Foley said on the CBS program.

<HEAD>Parole Examiners Recommend Release of Anti-Castro Militant, Lawyer
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal parole officials recommended Tuesday that
an anti-Castro militant convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign
freighters should be released after serving a three-month prison
sentence for violating parole, his lawyer said.
   The suggested sentence, which includes time Orlando Bosch has
spent in jail since returning to the United States, must be
approved by the U.S. Parole Commission. The panel is expected to
decide within three weeks.
   Parole examiners made the recommendation recommended after a
closed hearing Tuesday, Bosch's attorney, George Yoss said.
   Bosch, 61, convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign freighters
and of firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a Polish freighter
docked in Miami, served four years of a 10-year federal prison
sentence.
   He has acknowledged violating his parole when he traveled to
South America in 1974. He served 11 years in Venezuelan jails until
his acquittal on charges of bombing a Cuban jetliner in which 73
died in 1976.
   But after serving his three-month sentence by May 16, Bosch
probably will be taken into custody by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said Yoss. The INS has targeted Bosch for
possible deportation.
   Bosch entered the United States illegally last month after his
release from a Venezuelan prison. Since mid-February, he has been
detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in South Dade.
   Several prominent Cuban-Americans, including Jorge Mas Canosa,
head of the Cuban American National Foundation, testified before
the parole examiners in a hearing closed to the public because it
was an administrative procedure.
   Mas Canosa said after the hearing that Bosch should be released
because he had learned his lesson and now would work peacefully for
the overthrow of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   ``It is a crime to keep this man behind bars,'' Mas Canosa said.
   Dr. Alberto Hernandez, Bosch's physician, said he testified that
Bosch suffered from stomach, heart and prostate problems. Bosch's
illnesses would be aggravated by a prison sentence, he said.
   Ted Kline, who prosecuted Bosch in 1974, said he testified that
Bosch could be released safely.
   Tom Kowalski, the parole commission's Atlanta regional
administrator, said the decision would be forwarded to Regional
Commissioner George McKenzie Rast, who will make a recommendation
to the full, four-member parole commission in Washington.

<TEXT>
   Two men have been given a chance to avoid
federal prison terms for their role in a racially motivated fight
that resulted in the death of a Mexican-American farm worker five
years ago.
   Walter Pringle, 35, who faced a maximum 15-year federal prison
term, was sentenced Monday to 33 months in prison and assessed
$4,450 in fines, costs and restitution. Federal Judge G. Kendall
Sharp said Pringle would not have to go to prison if he can pay the
money by Sept. 1.
   Pringle was found guilty in January of violating the civil
rights of Joseph Ozuna, 26, by beating him unconscious near
Seville, a town of about 650 residents 60 miles north of here.
   Sharp also sentenced Mark Miller, 25, to 12 months in prison.
Sharp said he would suspend that sentence if Miller could pay
$1,500 in fines and restitution by Sept. 1. Miller had pleaded
guilty to conspiracy and testified for the government in the
January trial.
   Both he and Miller said later they would raise the money for the
fines and stay out of prison.
   A federal jury acquitted Pringle's ex-girlfriend, Paula Hires
Smith, 29, of violating the civil rights of Gilberto Garza, 17, by
shooting him to death in the same fight.
   The 1983 case triggered controversy when Pringle received a
six-month jail sentence, a $15 fine and five years probation after
pleading no contest to aggravated assault and battery, and Ms.
Smith was given 10 years probation for her no-contest plea to
manslaughter.
   Outrage over what were considered to be light sentences in the
state circuit court criminal case led to a federal investigation
and the January trial on civil rights charges in U.S. District
Court in Orlando.
   According to the federal indictment and information from Miller,
Pringle and Ms. Smith pursued cousins Ozuna and Garza into the
countryside. While Pringle was beating up Ozuna, Ms. Smith shot
Garza in the face with a rifle.
   ``I have been handing down sentences for 10 years, and I think
without doubt this is the most difficult case I ever had in terms
of meting out a sentence,'' Sharp told Pringle.
   But, the judge said, ``I am convinced that you will never do
anything like this again.''
   Pringle had contended that drinking got him into fights, and the
judge agreed, adding that only Pringle knows whether he is really
prejudiced against Mexican-Americans.

   Three children and their mother died
Tuesday morning when the children set fire to their house while
playing with matches, authorities said.
   The deaths follow a rash of similar fires here in recent months.
   Kevin Reardon, who heads a program aimed at preventing children
from starting fires, said 11 children have been killed in the last
four months in fires they started.
   Fire Battalion Chief David Zwayer identified the victims of
Tuesday's fire as Patty Compton, 36, and three of her children:
Joshua, 1, Jennifer, 4, and Cassandra, 5. All were dead at the
scene, officials said.
   A fourth child, Tanya Compton, 7, and a woman identified as a
family friend, Dorleen Wilson, 32, escaped the fire, Zwayer said.
   Police said the children were lighting matches and set fire to a
couch. According to witnesses, Ms. Compton went outside, but
returned to the house in an attempt to save her children.
   ``You (could) hear them crying and calling for their mom, and
then their mom went into the house,'' said witness Lakisha Glasco,
12.
   On Sunday, four children ages 10 and younger were killed when
fire struck their home. A fifth child survived and was in poor
condition Tuesday in Children's Hospital.
   Fire officials said they believe that fire also was caused by a
child playing with matches.

<HEAD>Yost Warns of More Coast Guard Closings Without Increased Funds</HEAD>

   More Coast Guard installations would be forced
to close next year if Congress fails to increase the agency's
budget by $300 million, the head of the Coast Guard said Tuesday.
   ``These are not intended as threats or scare stories; these are
the real choices that we face,'' Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., commandant
of the Coast Guard, told a House subcommittee.
   Yost said the Reagan administration's proposed fiscal 1989
funding level of $2.98 billion would not enable the Coast Guard to
reopen any of the nearly 30 stations and offices closed in February
because of a $103 million shortfall in the current budget.
   But Yost said the administration's proposal would allow the
remaining stations to stay open. In addition, it would restore to
full levels drug patrols, which were reduced by 55 percent last
month, and routine search and rescue patrols, which were eliminated.
   If Congress approved a budget with only modest increases from
1988, the agency would have a $171 million shortfall next year that
would trigger a more serious round of station closings, Yost said.
   ``I can't even come up with a list of Coast Guard (facilities)
that could be closed,'' he said.
   Rep. Earl Hutto, D-Fla., chairman of the House Merchant Marine
and Fisheries subcommittee on the Coast Guard and navigation,
embraced the administration's budget proposal as ``the minimum
necessary for the Coast Guard to continue to function in the manner
expected of it by the Congress and the American public.''
   Hutto and Yost said while the 1989 budget request is a big jump
from current spending levels, it really would just be bringing the
Coast Guard up to past levels.
   When adjusted for inflation, the budget request for the next
fiscal year is about the same as the 1983 spending levels. However,
the Coast Guard since has increased its drug interdiction
activities substantially.
   The congressional General Accounting Office found that from 1980
to 1987, the proportion of Coast Guard operating expenses devoted
to drug operations more than tripled _ from 7 percent to 22 percent.
   Meanwhile, the percentage devoted to more traditional Coast
Guard duties, such as search and rescue patrols and marine safety,
has been sliced from 60 percent to 51 percent, the GAO said.
   Last week, Yost unveiled an administration plan to transer $60
million from other Transportation Department accounts to the Coast
Guard to immediately upgrade patrol levels to last year's levels.

   Foreigners would be barred from working as
crew members aboard U.S. aircraft and ships during strikes against
the carriers, under legislation approved, 302-114, by the House on
Tuesday.
   The restrictions would apply only to American-owned planes or
ships that are entering or leaving the United States.
   Supporters of the legislation said the measure would protect the
rights of striking American workers by preventing companies from
hiring foreigners to replace them.
   ``Aliens should not be allowed to hurt American employees by
working in their jobs as strike-breakers,'' said Rep. Marge
Roukema, R-N.J., the measure's sponsor.
   Opponents said the bill would hurt carriers by forcing them to
release foreign employees in the event of a labor walkout, and
would invite retaliation by other countries.
   ``It is easy to be against foreign nationals,'' said Rep. Steve
Bartlett, R-Texas.
   The legislation was written in response to a 1986 strike against
Trans World Airlines Inc. by its flight attendants in which the
workers accused TWA of using foreigners to serve on trans-Atlantic
flights.
   The bill was sent to the Senate.

   Newly issued guidelines for dealing with
federal employees infected with the AIDS virus are in line with the
general anti-discrimination recommendations of the government's
health department.
   ``We worked very closely with the Office of Personnel Managment
in developing them,'' Dr. Robert Windom said Tuesday. ``The
regulations are reasonable and reflect PHS concerns.''
   Windom, No. 2 official of the Department of Health and Human
Services, heads the seven-agency Public Health Service that
includes the Centers for Disease Control, Food and Drug
Administration and National Institutes of Health.
   Windom will review the guidelines Thursday with personnel
officers from about 30 major federal agencies.
   ``The federal government, as an enlightened and compassionate
employer concerned with the health and welfare of its employees,
has an obligation to show the way in addressing the realities of
the AIDS epidemic,'' Constance Horner, director of the Office of
Personnel Management, said in a memo accompanying the guidelines'
initial distribution this week.
   Quoting from CDC statements on AIDS in the workplace, the
personnel office memo says, ``The kind of nonsexual
person-to-person contact that generally occurs among workers and
clients or consumers in the workplace does not pose a risk for
transmission of AIDS.''
   The guidelines instruct federal agencies to treat AIDS-infected
employees ``in the same manner as employees who suffer from other
serious illnesses'' and say there is ``no medical basis for
employees refusing to work with such fellow employees or agency
clients.'
   Fellow employes who disrupt agency functions by refusing to work
with an AIDS-infected person could be subject to ``appropriate
corrective or disciplinary action'' under the guidelines.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.

<HEAD>Free Market Flourishes Fleetingly In Brooklyn</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a few fleeting weeks, free enterprise
thrived in Brooklyn.
   That was back in the good old days, about two months ago, when a
thrifty commuter entering the Greenpoint Avenue subway station in
the morning could buy a $1 subway ride for 50 cents.
   The bargain was offered by three crafty entrepreneurs, who
discovered the key to a padlocked gate next to a turnstile. They
unlocked the gate, put the padlock on the turnstile and went into
competition with the New York City Transit Authority.
   From about 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. weekdays, the subway station was
turned into a bargain basement, according to an account in
Tuesday's New York Newsday.
   And then the police found out.
   ``AS OF 2-15 FARE FOR RIDER WILL BE 55 CENTS PER PERSON,'' read
a flyer handed to riders shortly after the police crackdown. ``AND
NO PENNIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED NO MORE. ... PEOPLE WE HAD RUN IN
WITH TRANSIT POLICE SO THAT WHY WE RAISE IT. WE COULDN'T AFFORD OF
GETTING BUSTED.''
   The flyer ended on a promotional note: ``CATCH THAT FARE
SPECIAL.''
   ``It became amusing,'' observed Transit Police Sgt. Tom
Sullivan, still slightly astonished by this flowering of the
entrepreneurial spirit. ``Because we arrested them, they increased
the fare.''
   The police had been notified by an irate token clerk, who
arrived with a uniformed police officer each morning at 7 a.m. to
find her competitors fully engaged in business.
   The token booth was staffed only at rush hour. The rest of the
day, patrons without tokens had to go to the main station entrance
two blocks away; those with tokens could go through the cage-like
turnstile _ until the discounters arrived.
   At first, the men scattered when the token clerk arrived. But
after a while, Sullivan said, ``They were being so brazen that they
would just retreat to the stairwell and wait for the uniformed cop
to leave.''
   Then they'd return to business, in full sight of the token
clerk, whose business dwindled. About 100 riders a day were taking
advantage of the reduced fare, plunking their money into a bucket
beside the swinging gate.
   ``This really infuriated the railroad clerk,'' said Sullivan.
   Her complaints eventually led to undercover operations that
resulted in the first arrests on Jan. 29. And the second arrests on
Feb. 1. Each time, the men were issued desk appearance tickets and
released. And each time, they went right back to work.
   On Feb. 16, the police raised the stakes against Paul Franklin,
35, Kenneth Norris, 36, and Willie Brown, 22. This time they went
to jail on charges including disorderly conduct, petty larceny,
criminal tampering and other crimes.
   So far, Franklin, who, like Brown, lived in an apartment near
the station, has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and served
eight days in jail. Norris, who lived in a homeless shelter, has
pleaded guilty to petty larceny and been sentenced to 70 hours of
community service _ including washing subway stations.
   ``Even as we made the arrests, we had one guy in handcuffs and
people were still walking up to him and trying to hand him money,''
Sullivan said. ``They were pretty slick in their operation. They
thought they had all ends covered.''

<HEAD>Verity Appeals for Quick Resolution of U.S.-Japanese Trade
Differences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity opened a
new round of Japanese trade negotiations on Tuesday with an appeal
for fast resolution of the differences separating the two sides.
   The negotiations involve U.S. demands that Japan allow American
and other foreign construction companies to compete for an
estimated $60 billion in public works projects planned in Japan
over the next decade.
   Verity announced that the American team would be headed by
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael B. Smith, who is taking
over from J. Michael Farren, a deputy commerce undersecretary who
is leaving the department because he was passed over for promotion.
   ``I trust that everyone in this room shares my feeling that
these negotiations on construction have gone on for too long
already and that the time has come to bring them to a close,''
Verity said in opening remarks.
   Last week, President Reagan's Cabinet-level Economic Policy
Council set a two-week deadline for resolving the construction
dispute. If the issue is not settled by the deadline,
administration officials have indicated they will recommend that
the president bring a trade complaint against Japan, a process
which could lead to U.S. trade retaliation against Japan.
   The Japanese have offered to allow U.S. companies access to
seven public works projects. U.S. negotiators have contended in the
past that this offer was too small and omitted sophisticated
engineering jobs.
   But Verity, in his remarks, indicated a willingness to consider
the Japanese proposal as a starting point.
   ``The Japanese side has suggested that contracts worth $30
billion in seven major projects could be opened to bidding by our
firms,'' he said. ``Very well, then, we simply ask that you open
them, and that, over time, you add additional projects until the
Japanese construction market is open.''
   Verity called on the Japanese to open up ``the broadest spectrum
of contract work'' to U.S. bidding.
   ``Earthmoving and runway construction are not enough,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gephardt, Dukakis Trade Charges on Trade</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Clears garble in 13th graf, On July</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Richard Gephardt charged Tuesday that
Michael Dukakis' support for tough trade legislation is just ``a
political ploy'' that will end after the Michigan caucuses are over.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, said his position on trade
has been consistent, and his staff released quotations from last
year indicating his support for major provisions of a Senate trade
bill.
   ``Who is for a tough trade policy? Who is going to be for a
tough trade policy after Michigan?'' Gephardt asked in a telephone
interview Tuesday. ``The answer is, Dick Gephardt is and will be.
Mike Dukakis hasn't been, isn't and won't be.''
   ``When he is on the East and West Coast, he wants to talk about
free trade. When he's in Michigan, he doesn't,'' Gephardt said.
   Gephardt's tough trade legislation, now in a conference
committee on Capitol Hill, has been the capstone of the Missouri
congressman's platform.
   Monday night, Dukakis endorsed trade legislation sponsored by
Michigan Sen. Donald Riegle, who in turn endorsed Dukakis. Gephardt
quickly accused Dukakis of having a ``battlefield conversion'' on
trade, saying the Riegle bill was the Senate version of the
Gephardt legislation.
   Dukakis and Jesse Jackson are tied for the lead in the polls on
Saturday's Michigan caucuses, with Gephardt a distant third.
Dukakis aides say that may be the reason for Gephardt's attacks.
   On Tuesday, Gephardt stepped up the attack, questioning the
sincerity of Dukakis' support for such legislation.
   ``I think he remains against it. I think it is a political
ploy,'' Gephardt said. ``By what he has done, he is trying to have
it both ways. ... Now that he is in Michigan and we are five days
out from the caucuses, he wants to fool the people of Michigan.''
   Dukakis said in Michigan late Monday that his position hasn't
changed.
   ``He has been a strong opponent of the Gephardt bill from the
begining, but has always been an advocate of leveling the (trade)
playing field,'' said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   Dukakis' staff on Tuesday pointed to quotes from the
Massachusetts governor last year in favor of the Senate bill.
   On July 11, 1987, Dukakis said, ``I think the trade bill which
the Senate approved yesterday says if there is a consistent pattern
of unfair trade practices ... there I think we have to do
something.''
   ``I feel a lot better about the Senate bill'' than the Gephardt
trade legislation, Dukakis said on Aug. 4, 1987.
   Gephardt said Dukakis ``has said in the past you don't need new
legislation. ... He has been profoundly negative about everything I
have said about trade.''
   The congressman, too, provided quotes from Dukakis last year _
quotes he said back up his charge of a flip-flop.
   ``The president today has all the authority he needs to do
something about those unfair trade practices. We do not need more
laws or more amendments,'' Dukakis said at the Aug. 8 debate at
Drake University, according to Gephardt aides.
   In debates in Dallas and Atlanta, Dukakis told Gephardt, ``You
want a law. Dick, I want to act.''
   And earlier this year in Lansing, Mich., Gephardt aides said,
Dukakis said ``We do not need more legislation.''
   The Gephardt amemdment and the Riegle bill do differ, but both
try to strengthen potential retaliation against U.S. trading
partners for unfair practices. In general, the Riegle bill would
target specific industries in foreign countries which engage in
unfair practices. The Gephardt amendment would trigger retaliation
against another country for running a big surplus with this country
in part through unfair practices.
   ``Dukakis has always felt the president has had the authority to
act. The Riegle amendment ... gives the president a better way to
get there, but he can pretty much get there on his own now,''
Dukakis spokesman Dach said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of poor people are lining
up for help at churches and soup kitchens as the country sinks
deeper into political and economic crisis.
   ``It is a good thing people have such a good heart at times like
this,'' Israel Gonzalez said Monday as he cooked a big pot of rice
over an open fire outside San Jose Church in San Miguelito, a poor
neighborhood on the outskirts of town.
   The poor have been hit hardest by a campaign to oust strongman
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega that has crippled businesses, closed
banks and dried up the supply of cash. Noriega is chief of Panama's
15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the civilian
government.
   While a general strike paralyzed Panama City on Monday, scores
of volunteers like Gonzalez were working at soup kitchens run by
Caritas, a Roman Catholic community organization.
   The Rev. Francisco Verar said his parish at San Jose Church is a
made up ``mostly of people who are underemployed.''
   They include ``women who wash and iron or work as maids and now
cannot find a job, construction workers who have not worked since
the crisis started or laborers who work in whatever they can
find,'' he said.
   Although food and money are scarce for almost everyone, help has
been streaming in, the Rev. Laureano Duran, director of Caritas,
said as he watched dozens of volunteers pick up bags of donated
food.
   ``We have to help those who are worse off than we are,'' said a
housewife who brought a sack of groceries.
   Duran said Caritas believes more than 6,000 families in the
archdiocese are without money or food.
   Gonzalez, the owner of a small neighborhood grocery store, said
he has been cooking broth for several days for the thousands of
people who have lined up at the San Jose soup kitchen.
   ``My wife and I are working here now every day,'' he said. ``No
one is buying anything anyway, so I am not needed at the store.''
   As Gonzalez cooked, wiping the sweat off his forehead, Cirila
Flores and her six children waited for a hot meal.
   ``I live alone but I have always managed to get food for my
children washing clothes and ironing,'' she said. ``Now there are
no jobs because no one has money. I have never been through a
situation like this before.''
   Verar said the San Jose kitchen has been feeding chicken and
rice and vitamins to the needy.
   ``We are cooking at least 300 pounds of rice every day,'' he
said. ``We think we will have some beans and lentil soup tomorrow.''
   San Jose also has a malnutrition clinic staffed by volunteer
doctors and nurses.
   ``They starve to give food to their children,'' Dr. Carlos
Lizarraga said, pointing to a woman he said had not eaten since
Friday so she could feed her six children.
   ``My husband works in construction and he has not been paid,''
explained Alicia Flores, 26. ``I do not work and we are about to go
out on the street and beg. It's all Noriega's fault. We don't even
have bananas to eat.''

   The City Council has approved an ordinance
requiring guests checking into the city's 11 hotels and motels to
show identification.
   The measure was proposed in January following the discovery of
the bodies of two women in different hotel rooms. The deaths, one
attributed to strangulation and the other to drowning, were not
related, authorities said.
   Mayor Francis X. Flaherty was expected to sign the ordinance in
a couple of days, said mayoral spokeswoman Anne Turner. It would go
into effect 20 days later, she said.
   Councilman Lincoln D. Chafee, the only one of the seven council
members to vote against the ordinance Monday night, called the
measure ``loose and vague'' and cautioned the council against
``stampeding to enact a bad bill.''
   The ordinance was amended to say that information from a hotel
registrant will be used only for emergencies or during criminal
investigations. The American Civil Liberties Union had complained
that the original version violated the rights of individuals.
   The guest who pays for a hotel room would be required to show a
driver's license, major credit card, state identification card,
military identification card, passport, vehicle registration or
vehicle title documents.
   Councilman C. Kenneth Wild Jr., who proposed the ordinance in
January, said it would help police investigate cases such as those
of the two women. Identification would not be required of people
other than the person signing for the room.
   Neither woman had paid for the room where she was found dead. In
the drowning, two people were charged with leaving the scene of a
death, but no one has been arrested in the strangulation, police
said.

   U.S. troops sent here for emergency
training exercises will stay on to complete the maneuvers, a U.S.
military spokesman said Tuesday, although Honduras says its border
crisis with Nicaragua is over.
   ``Right now the plans are to make it a 10- to 14-day exercises.
We have not received any directive as to when to begin
redeployment,'' said U.S. spokesman Maj. Gary Hovatter in a
telephone interview.
   He said exercises were taking place Tuesday at four sites.
   President Reagan ordered 3,200 American troops to Honduras last
week at the request of President Jose Azcona Hoyo, who had accused
Sandinista soldiers from neighboring Nicaragua of penetrating
Honduran territory in pursuit of U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua denied his troops were in
Honduras. Last week Honduran jets twice bombed Nicaraguan positions
to force them to leave. No casualties were reported.
   Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras told The
Associated Press in an interview Tuesday the border tension ``has
virtually disappeared'' after both the Sandinistas and the Contras
suspended hostilities and began truce talks.
   The three days of negotiations began Monday in the small
southern Nicaraguan town of Sapoa, near the Costa Rican border. The
talks aim mainly at reaching a cease-fire so that both sides can
strike a permanent peace accord in their 7-year-old war.
   The dispatch of the U.S. troops bolstered the American military
presence in Honduras to about 6,000 servicemen. The Reagan
administration billed it as both a show of support for Azcona and a
warning to the Sandinistas against further actions in the border
region.
   As the Sandinistas pulled out of the Bocay region, where the
incursion took place, Azcona said the additional U.S. troops would
not be needed much longer.
   Hovatter said, however, that the troops will complete their
training first. The United States has been carrying out joint
exercises with the Honduran military periodically for five years as
part of the Reagan administration's policy of isolating the
Sandinistas.
   Ten American soldiers were injured Monday when their UH-1 Huey
helicopter crashed during an exercise near the southern Honduran
town of Juticalpa, apparently as a result of mechanical failure.
   Hovatter said five or six of the injured soldiers would be
released for light duty.

<HEAD>Documents Show Nixon White House Kept Heavy Pressure On Fed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nixon White House kept heavy pressure on
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur Burns to do its bidding but
gently turned aside complaints from one Fed critic, then-California
Governor Ronald Reagan, documents made public on Tuesday show.
   Among 400,000 pages of White House records released by the
National Archives is a Sept. 17, 1973 letter from Reagan to Nixon
complaining about the impact of a Fed decision on California
mortgage loans.
   The documents also included many internal White House memoranda
suggesting that White House aides devoted considerable effort to
encourage Burns, appointed by Nixon in 1970, to stimulate the
economy prior to Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign.
   Critics claim the easy-money policy pursued by Burns in the
early 1970s did keep the economy humming through 1972, but set the
stage for sharply rising interest rates and inflation in the
following year, triggering a recession.
   In his letter to Nixon, Reagan contended that the Fed and the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board were drying up the availability of
mortgage money in California.
   They were doing this by easing restrictions that had kept
interest rates which banks could pay on savings accounts below
those offered by savings and loan associations, Reagan said.
   The result, he wrote, ``has been a flow of funds from savings
and loans to banks.''
   Since savings and loans are the ``major supplier of funds for
home building in California,'' the result of the action threatened
``irreparable damage'' to his state's home-building industry, Gov.
Reagan charged.
   ``Present events have occurred which places the home-building
industry in the state of California in a potentially grave
situation,'' Reagan wrote.
   The Reagan letter was shunted back and forth among several
aides, with Tod R. Hullin, an assistant to domestic policy adviser
John Ehrlichman, recommending that it be given ``special
attention.''
   Although White House assistant Kenneth Dam wrote a draft of a
White House response, the final job of answering Reagan was given
to George P. Shultz, then Nixon's treasury secretary and now
Reagan's secretary of state.
   Shultz told his future boss that while the Nixon administration
``shares your concern,'' a return to the former limitations on
interests paid by banks would not solve the problem of California
savings and loans.
   ``We have been limited in our ability to maintain the
availablity of home mortgage credit,'' Shultz said.
   Then, he added: ``Inflation is our most important domestic
problem and this administration firmly believes that the nation is
best served in the longer term by our vigorous efforts to curb
inflation.''
   The documents released on Tuesday were a second installment of
Nixon White House material made public by the Archives. An earlier
730,000 papers from the White House Central Files Unit, containing
many personal documents kept by Nixon and his top lieutenants, was
made public in December 1986.
   The newly released documents seemed likely to fuel longstanding
speculation by critics that Burns deliberately manipulated monetary
policy to help re-elect Nixon _ an allegation the late central bank
chairman repeatedly denied.
   In any event, the documents show a pattern of close White House
involvement with the Fed on monetary issues during Burns' tenure,
including frequent meetings among Burns and top White House
officials.
   At one point, the White House even arranged an ``appreciation''
luncheon for Burns in late 1971 to which 58 leaders from the
financial community were invited.
   Although the first 20 minutes of the late Fed chairman's speech
to the group ``was somewhat professorial,'' Burns at the end of his
speech ``was very optimistic. From this point of view, the lunch
was a success,'' former White House aide Peter Flanigan said in a
confidential memo to Nixon.
   Noting that financial writers were then brought into the
luncheon to speak to Burns, the memo continued: ``While Arthur is
no (then Treasury Secretary) John Connally in terms of stimulating
a response, the exercise was clearly a plus.''
   In an August 20, 1970 memo to Nixon, his then chief economic
adviser, Paul McCracken, praised Burns for ``effective leadership''
at the Fed in easing monetary policy and proposed that the money
supply be permitted to grow even more rapidly.
   ``We urge this in no sense of trying to `take over' monetary
policy, but merely as those who will be held accountable for the
economy's performance during this period,'' McCracken wrote to
Nixon.
   ``The relationship between administration officials and the
Federal Reserve system has always been a somewhat uneasy one,''
McCracken added. ``But it is the president who will be held
politically accountable for the economic results of Federal Reserve
Policy.''
   Burns himself wrote a confidential note to Nixon on March 9,
1970, pointing out how the nation's money supply had grown since he
had been named Fed chief five weeks earliers.
   ``Let me add that the (Fed) board's liberalizing action took
place only on February 10 _ the first meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee over which I presided,'' Burns wrote to Nixon. The
committee is the Fed's chief policy-making unit.

   A television evangelist who resigned as
pastor of the Orange County church he started is the target of a
police investigation and lawsuits claiming he owes tens of
thousands of dollars.
   Richard Hogue, who came here from Oklahoma one year ago after
facing financial difficulties in that state, said in a television
interview Tuesday he resigned as pastor of Metrochurch Sunday to
concentrate on paying his debts.
   ``I'm just having to knuckle down and go back to work and take
my time and try to work myself back out of this debt,'' Hogue said
in a telephone interview with station KOCO in Oklahoma City.
   Hogue was interviewed from Miami, where he said he is ``looking
to put together a major opportunity which could mean I could maybe
be out of debt very soon.''
   Hogue frequently appeared on ``Richard Hogue Weekdays'' on the
PTL Network formerly run by defrocked minister Jim Bakker and his
wife Tammy. He also occasionally hosted a show on Trinity
Broadcasting Network called ``Praise the Lord.''
   Trinity discontinued using Hogue as a host three weeks ago.
   ``The red lights went off when we learned his board has
resigned,'' TBN attorney Norman Juggert said.
   Former Metrochurch members June and David Muehlberger of Palm
Springs filed suit in Orange County Superior Court on Dec. 16,
1987, against Metrochurch and Hogue, alleging he repaid just $2,000
of a $126,000 they loaned him to buy pews.
   Irvine police said Monday they are investigating allegations of
embezzlement as a result of the Muehlbergers' complaint.
   ``We don't know if it's a civil problem or a criminal problem,''
Sgt. Scott Cabe said. ``It just popped up in the last two or three
days.''
   In 1985, Hogue resigned from his church in Oklahoma, where he
was a well-known pastor and TV personality.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that Hogue's former
Oklahoma attorneys are seeking $18,426 they claim he owes for legal
services.
   ``We've been trying to catch the guy for two years,'' David
Livingston, attorney for the Oklahoma law firm of Mosburg, Sears,
Kunzman and Bollinger, was quoted as saying.
   The Times also reported that an Oklahoma couple sued Hogue and
alleged he failed to repay $142,000 on a $160,000 note for a
157-acre horse ranch. The newspaper also reported that Hogue's
Oklahoma house was foreclosed for a $228,000 debt he owed GMAC
Mortgage Corp. of Iowa.
   Separately, Hogue's assistant, Mike Maggard, said Monday ``It
appears that Pastor Hogue and (his wife) Marilyn may be
separating.''

<HEAD>Joe Chagra Freed After Nearly 6 Years Prison for Wood Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Chagra, a former lawyer who spent
nearly six years in prison for plotting the assassination of a
federal judge, says it feels good to be free of prison and free of
drugs.
   Chagra, 41, was released on parole Friday from a federal prison
in Stafford, Ariz.
   ``For all the sadness and the pain that you go through, walking
out of that gate has to be the all-time high in life,'' he told the
El Paso Times. ``I can't really tell you how good I feel.''
   Chagra pleaded guilty in 1982 of conspiring to kill U.S.
District Judge John H. Wood Jr., who had been scheduled to preside
over the drug trial of Joe's older brother, Jimmy.
   Wood, known as ``Maximum John'' because of his tough sentencing
of drug dealers, was murdered outside his San Antonio home in 1979.
   Jimmy Chagra, who along with Joe was accused of hiring Charles
Harrelson to kill Wood, was acquitted on a murder conspiracy charge
and is imprisoned on a drug conviction. Harrelson was sentenced to
two life terms.
   Joe Chagra blamed his problems on a heavy cocaine habit and the
influence of his two older brothers, Jimmy and Lee.
   ``Now we know what a seductive drug cocaine is,'' said Chagra,
who said he is a convert to health foods and exercise. ``I'm sorry
that (drug use) happened. It did. I can't change it. ... I don't
anticipate any more problems in my life.''
   Lee Chagra, the eldest brother, gained notoriety by successfully
defending alleged drug dealers. He was gunned down in his office in
December 1978.
   Both Lee and Jimmy Chagra lived flamboyantly, gambling huge
amounts of money and using drugs. Jimmy Chagra once paid off a Las
Vegas casino debt of more than $900,000 in cash, and he lost a
$580,000 golf match.
   Joe Chagra, who has been disbarred, returned to El Paso Friday
but declined to discuss what he plans to do.
   ``The only thing I won't do is make any hasty decisions,'' he
said.

   Lyn Nofziger tried unsuccessfully to make
then-Interior Secretary Walter Hickel an emissary to protesting
students after Hickel's famous protest letter to President Nixon in
1970, according to newly released White House documents.
   Nofziger, a long-time political aide to President Reagan who was
convicted of illegal lobbying last month, was working in the White
House congressional relations office at the time.
   A memorandum from Nofziger to H.R. Haldemann, Nixon's chief of
staff, turned up in the latest batch of Nixon White House files
opened by the National Archives on Tuesday.
   Hickel wrote Nixon on May 6, 1970, after the invasion of
Cambodia by U.S. forces in Vietnam had set off a storm of protest
on the nation's campuses. He said that attacks on the protesters by
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew were creating an impression of a lack
of concern for ``the attitude of a great mass of Americans _ our
young people.''
   The letter, whose prompt appearance in newspapers dismayed the
White House, said Nixon should, among other things, talk with
members of the Cabinet from time to time. Hickel was quoted in news
accounts as saying he had had only two personal meetings with Nixon
since becoming secretary more than a year before.
   Nofziger's memo, dated May 8, 1970, said: ``Whether we like it
or not, Wally Hickel is the kids' new hero. Suggest we use him.
Suggest he meet with the president Saturday and then send him out
to talk to the kids.
   ``Why not have the president meet with a group of kids tomorrow
at mid-morning to take some of the steam out of the demonstration
and give us some favorable publicity?''
   The Nofziger memo was directed, apparently by Haldemann's
office, to Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments secretary. Chapin
seems to have sent it back to Ken Cole, Haldemann's assistant, with
the handwritten notation: ``Ken Cole _ good idea? _ C''.
   After that appeared the one word, unattributed: ``No.''
   Nixon did meet with protesting students, on his own without
staff preparation, at 5 a.m. at the Lincoln Memorial. That meeting
garnered much publicity, most of it in a tone of astonishment.
   Hickel and Nixon defended each other in public appearances
immediately after that, but Hickel did not get to see Nixon and the
president fired him on November 25 _ in a personal meeting.
   Hickel was traveling Tuesday and could not be reached, said his
office in Anchorage, Alaska. Nofziger had left for the day and also
could not be reached, according to his Washington office.

   A Pennsylvania man who received political
asylum in the Soviet Union says the socialist life suits him just
fine.
   ``We have found this country to be free, with all freedoms you
find in America. You may also attend the church of your choice.
People also speak freely,'' Theodore Branch said in a letter from
Moscow to George Sharrer of Erie.
   Branch, 43, and his wife, Cheryle Hoffman Branch, 40, left the
United States with a tour group in November. On Jan. 19, Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov announced that the
Branches had been granted political asylum and would be given jobs
and an apartment.
   ``In the USSR there is no unemployment and no homeless people.
Also, medical care is free. This is also true in most cases for
visitors. Each employee receives one month's paid vacation each
year,'' Branch wrote in a letter Sharrer said he received Saturday.
   The Branches lost their jobs at a Florida radio station when it
went off the air in 1986, and were unable to collect back pay of
$6,500 which was awarded by a court.
   Sharrer, an Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority driver for 11
years, said he talked with Branch when the man rode home from his
job as a janitor at an Erie department store.
   ``I never heard anything from him about ideology,'' he told the
Erie Daily Times. ``He got disgusted with not being able to find a
job. He kept saying he couldn't make ends meet with a minimum-wage
job.''
   The two sometimes ate together on the bus during a scheduled
layover at the Millcreek Mall, Sharrer said.
   ``One day, he told me he had been in Washington and that he'd
been approached by someone in the Soviet Embassy. He said he was
offered a job working at a radio station. He said he was going to
go over and see if he liked the job. He asked me for my address and
said he'd write me and tell me how it was going,'' Sharrer said.
   Sharrer, a member of the Naval Reserve, gave a copy of Branch's
letter to his commanding officer and notified the FBI.
   ``I'm afraid to write him back because of my security
clearance'' as a computer operator, Sharrer said.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Announces He Will Seek Second Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand ended months of
speculation on Tuesday by announcing that he will seek a second
term.
   Opinion polls have put the 71-year-old Socialist in the lead for
the two-stage election, beginning April 24, although he was not
formally in the race.
   On Tuesday, Mitterrand appeared on the nationwide evening
newscast of state-owned Antenne 2 television. When asked if he
would run, Mitterrand paused dramatically, clearly relishing the
moment, and answered with a single word: ``Oui.'' Yes.
   In reply to follow-up questions, the president said he decided
to run because he thinks disunity threatened ``to tear the social
fabric'' of France.
   ``I saw a risk that the country might fall again into the
quarrels and divisions that have hampered it so often. I want
France to be united ... not be taken in hand by the spirit of
intolerance, by parties who want everything, by clans, by
cliques,'' he said.
   As soon as Mitterrand declared, Michel Rocard, until now the
Socialist Party's only candidate, withdrew from the race and gave
the president his full support.
   Mitterrand's plans had been the subject of intense speculation.
On some occassions he had indicated that he would preferred to
retire and at other times hinted he would run because of a sense of
duty.
   In the end, with four weeks remaining before voters go to the
polls, duty called.
   The main conservative candidates, Premier Jacques Chirac and
former Premier Raymond Barre, had criticized Mitterrand for being
coy and cutting short the democratic debate.
   Mitterrand justified his silence by saying that with the premier
campaigning it was up to the president to look after the nation's
affairs in a non-partisan way.
   The conservatives hope to end what the French call
``cohabitation,'' created when the conservatives ousted the
Socialists from control of the National Assembly in March 1986, but
were left with a Socialist president with two years to go in his
term.
   The president is chief of state and has major duties in defense
and foreign affairs. He appoints a prime minister who must be
backed by a majority of the National Assembly. The premier then
names his Cabinet and runs the government.
   Mitterrand said Tuesday that after watching the campaign, he
feared opposing candidates were bringing on France disputes that
threatened to damage the country.
   ``We need social peace,'' he said. ``Someone has to face up to
this, and I shall do it.''
   Chirac heads the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic and Barre
the center-right Union for French Democracy.
   In a statement issued by Chirac's campaign committee, the
premier said: ``The stakes are now clear. There is on one side the
Socialist Party which wants to retake power to lead a Socialist
policy and its candidate casts aspersion on all the others.''
   There was no immediate reaction from Barre.
   National polls consistently placed Mitterrand ahead of Barre and
Chirac in a campaign that has been more a contest of styles than
policies.
   A handful of minor-party contenders, including Andre Lejoinie of
the once-powerful Communists, are expected to draw a combined total
of 5 percent of the vote or less. Jean-Marie Le Pen of the
extreme-right National Front could get about 10 percent of the vote.
   A poll published in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper Sunday
indicated 55 percent of the 1,813 people polled were satisfied with
Mitterrand. Forty-eight percent were satisfied with Chirac as
premier.
   Another recent poll, however, indicated 30 percent of those
queried were undecided.
   Mitterrand told the TV audience Tuesday night that he would
pursue the programs and policies of the last seven years.
   ``I have maintained the confidence of the French people,'' he
said.
   He suggested that if he won, he might dissolve the National
Assembly and call for new parliamentary elections.
   The first round of the elections is to be held April 24 with a
run-off between the top two candidates scheduled for May 8.

<HEAD>NRC Clears Way For Restart Of Sequoyah Unit 2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tennessee Valley Authority, bidding to
recover from the 1985 shutdown of its entire nuclear power system,
won permission from the government on Tuesday to restart the
Sequoyah Unit 2 reactor near Chattanooga, Tenn.
   The 5-0 vote by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission clears the way
for the Sequoyah plant to become the first of five licensed TVA
reactors to resume production of power. The approval was
conditioned, however, on TVA resolving a last-minute problem
involving temperature detectors in the plant's pressurizer system.
   The unanimous vote also provided a clear indication that the NRC
is not seriously concerned _ at least from a safety standpoint _
about allegations involving the TVA's nuclear chief, Steven A.
White.
   In a case referred to the Justice Department last year, NRC
investigators questioned White's veracity when he certified in
writing that another TVA nuclear plant, Watts Bar, met federal
quality assurance standards. White has denied any wrongdoing.
   NRC Chairman Lando Zech said the commissioners had reviewed the
case, still pending at the Justice Department, and ``we have
concluded ... that there is no presently known regulatory reason to
preclude authorization to restart'' Sequoyah Unit 2.
   ``There is nothing unusual about the commission's consideration
of a restart while investigations are ongoing,'' Zech added.
   On Capitol Hill, TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon told the House
Public Works subcommittee on investigations that ``tremendous
progress is being made in our nuclear recovery efforts ... led by
Steve White.''
   ``TVA is about ready to turn its nuclear corner,'' said Runyon.
   Runyon said the TVA hopes to have a second Sequoyah reactor,
Unit 1, ready for restart within six months.
   The Sequoyah facilities and three reactors at the Browns Ferry
plant, near Athens, Ala., were closed in 1985 for safety
improvements. After a management shakeup, construction of four
other reactors was slowed down and plans for nine others were
canceled. The TVA still was left with $15 billion in long-term
debts for the nuclear program.
   Runyon said the first of the Browns Ferry plants should be ready
for restart sometime next year.
   ``We're not going to rush this process,'' said Runyon. ``We're
proceeding deliberately, and we're putting public safety above all
else. No one reactor will be restarted unless we are conpletely
confident, and the NRC is fully satisfied, that it can be operated
safely and efficiently for a good, long time.''

   A blaze ignited in a kitchen and swept
through more than 2,000 buildings in a northern Burmese city,
killing 113 people and leaving 20,000 homeless, government radio
reported Tuesday.
   In a separate development, insurgents attacked a famous hilltop
pagoda and killed five pilgrims and a government soldier, the state
radio said Tuesday.
   The radio said the fire Sunday afternoon burned two primary
schools as it engulfed 2,096 buildings within two hours in Lashio,
a city of 200,000 in the northern Shan states.
   Efforts to communicate via telephone or telex with The
Associated Press office in Burma early Wednesday to obtain more
details were unsuccessful. It is often difficult to get phone or
telex connections to the country.
   The report said most of the victims were trapped by the fire,
which began in the kitchen of a Chinese resident, Chao Wai Lin.
   In addition to the dead, 64 people suffered serious burns, the
radio said. The casualty toll was the largest ever reported in a
fire in Burma.
   More than 3,000 families lost their homes and damages were
estimated at about $10 million, the radio said.
   Lashio, 450 miles northeast of Rangoon, is the largest city and
business center in the northern Shan states and the seat of the
northeast military command.
   In the pagoda attack, the radio said insurgents of the Karen
National Union attacked the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda in Mon state Monday
with mortars, and then looted pagoda donation boxes and shops,
robbed pilgrims and set fire to 13 shops and a fire station.
   It said 16 pilgrims and eight government soldiers were wounded
before the rebels were driven off in a four-hour firefight.
   The pagoda, 120 miles northeast of Rangoon, attracts large
numbers of pilgrims from all over the country, especially between
December and March each year.
   The Karens are among several ethnic minorities in Burma fighting
the central government for greater autonomy.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Tuesday
conditionally authorized a restart of the Rancho Seco nuclear power
plant near Sacramento, Calif., after a 27-month shutdown which
triggered a management shakeup and hundreds of plant modifications.
   The commission, in a 5-0 vote, stipulated that one remaining
equipment problem _ excessive vibration in emergency diesel
generators _ must be resolved to the satisfaction of the NRC's
staff before the restart can begin.
   Even if the generator problem is handled swiftly, Rancho Seco
still faces an uncertain future. Area voters are scheduled to
decide on the day of the California primary, June 7, whether the
913-megawatt facility should be closed permanently.
   The reactor is the sole nuclear plant owned by the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District, but it represents about 55 percent of
the utility's generating capacity and is directly responsible for
1,000 jobs and $75 million in wages. Indirectly, as many as 3,000
jobs and $150 million in wages are affected.
   The plant, which has long history of problems, was shut down in
December 1985 because of a power loss in its control system,
leading to severe overcooling of the reactor. The NRC subsequently
required major overhauls of the equipment, as well as deep changes
in management and operator training programs.
   Carl Andognini, SMUD's chief nuclear officer, and Ann Taylor, a
board member of the utility, told the commission the plant is ready
for restart, except for the diesel problem, and pledged that safety
would always remain the paramount concern in future operations.
   Taylor said ``there's tremendous support for the plant, out
there in the community.''
   But Ed Smeloff, another board member, said he thought Rancho
Seco should be closed permanently, even though ``I do believe it
can be operated safely.''
   Smeloff said he thought the dangers were economic, arguing that
the utility is too small to support an expensive nuclear plant with
an uncertain potential for future production. ``Rancho Seco
represents a $200 million per year risk,'' he said. ``We are not a
large enough utility to support that kind of risk.''
   One of the questions facing the voters is whether the plant
should remain open provided it meets certain production goals. NRC
Chairman Lando Zech chided the SMUD board for wording the issue
that way, saying ``you should have emphasized safety on the ballot.
It gives the commission some concern about the judgment of the
board.''

Expenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of about 300 West Coast citizens
arrived in the nation's capital Tuesday, hoping to persuade
Congress to spend more on domestic programs and less on the
military.
   The group, including residents from Washington, Oregon and
California, arrived five hours behind schedule because of
mechanical troubles, but remained enthusiastic about its mission.
   ``This train is bound for Congress,'' the residents sang upon
their arrival at Union Station near the Capitol. ``Get this country
back on track, get this deficit off our back.''
   The group, part of the ``Citizens' Train'' which began a
cross-country journey on Saturday, was greeted by several lawmakers
from the Northwest.
   Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., told the group that lawmakers
recently had been discussing the emergency deployment of U.S.
troops to Honduras but ``today they have been discussing you, an
emergency deployment of citizens to Washington.''
   A leaflet from the group calls on the president and Congress to
establish a citizens' budget ``based on the ideals of the U.S.
Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Further, we call upon the
president and the Congress to address the critical issue of the
unprecedented national deficit with a keen regard for the
well-being of all Americans.''
   The group planned to lobby Congress on Wednesday and Thursday
and attend several briefings and receptions with members of the
West Coast congressional delegations.

   Almost a billion dollars must be allocated to
the space station next year or America will have to abandon plans
to build the orbiting platform, NASA Administrator James C.
Fletcher said Tuesday.
   A substantial cut in the space station budget, added to delays
caused by cuts in earlier years, will make it useless for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to continue efforts
to build the station, he said.
   ``This is year is crucial,'' Fletcher told the Senate
subcommittee on science, technology and space. ``Otherwise, we've
got to just forget it and start over at a later date.''
   But senators attending the hearing warned Fletcher that would be
extremely difficult to get NASA its entire requested budget in a
year when federal dollars are tight because of deficit-cutting
efforts. Seeral pressed him on how much of a reduction could be
tolerated in the space station program, but Fletcher said the
requested budget was the ``rock bottom'' that NASA needs.
   Fletcher said a severe cut in the station budget last year
caused a full year's delay, and another cut in fiscal year 1989,
which begins Oct. 1, would make it ``a waste of the taxpayers
dollars'' to continue the underfunded program.
   NASA's 1989 budget calls for a total of $967.4 million for the
space station. Plans call for the station to be assembled in orbit
and for crews to start living in the orbiting laboratory in the
middle of the next decade.
   The station funds are part of a $11.5 billion appropriation
request by NASA that would include money for space shuttle
missions, advanced shuttle rockets, aeronautical research and a
study of the technology that will be needed one day to send
astronauts back to the moon and possibly to Mars.
   The budget request, which was approved by President Reagan, is a
24 pecent increase over NASA's current spending blueprint.
   Fletcher said that unless Congress passes the entire space
budget, there is no way for the U.S. to maintain world leadership
in space.
   ``The entire future of the civil space program rides at risk on
this budget,'' he said. ``This is a crucial year ... It will make
or break the civil space program.''
   Fletcher said the budget is the final boost needed for NASA's
recovery from the 1986 Challenger disaster, in which a space
shuttle was destroyed and seven astronauts killed. The shuttle
fleet has been grounded since while the space agency corrected
flawed equipment that caused the accident.
   NASA tentatively plans to resume shuttle flights in August. Two
are planned for this year, seven in 1989 and 10 in 1990.
   ``Without this increase, NASA will be in serious trouble,''
Fletcher said. ``A major cut would be equivalent to the Challenger
disaster itself.''

   A scholar abused research privileges at the
Library of Congress and National Archives to steal and try to sell
letters signed by Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill and other
historic figures, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
   Charles Merrill Mount also defaced some letters between Lincoln
and Civil War generals to remove government markings that would
have alerted a rare documents dealer to the fact they were stolen,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Martin Murphy said in his opening statement
at Mount's trial.
   But Mount's attorney, Charles McGinty, argued Mount had legally
collected the documents and shoddy record-keeping led the Library
of Congress and National Archives to believe the letters were part
of their collections.
   McGinty said the government would offer no evidence showing
Mount stole the documents, a point Murphy conceded.
   Mount, 59, a Washington-based author of several artists'
biographies, tearfully denied the allegations, but predicted he
would be convicted.
   Mount told reporters outside court that associates in Ireland,
including Prime Minister Charles Haughey, had seen the documents
when Mount lived in Ireland during the 1960s. But Mount said a
government freeze on his assets prevented him from bringing
witnesses to the United States to testify on his behalf.
   ``Without witnesses, I'm going to be convicted,'' he said.
   Mount is charged with two counts of interstate transportation of
stolen property and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000
fine if convicted. His trial is expected to last three weeks.
   Mount was arrested in August when he tried to sell a 158-page
collection of Civil War documents to Goodspeed's Book Store for
$64,600. A month earlier, the store paid Mount $20,000 for 23
letters signed by 19th-century painter James McNeill Whistler, a
Churchill letter and one by Henry James.
   The Whistler letters, brought to Boston in a plastic bag, were
stolen from the Library of Congress last July, Murphy told the jury.
   The Civil War collection disappeared from the National Archives
within a week before Mount's Aug. 5 letter to Goodspeed's offering
to sell the documents, Murphy said. Mount spent the last five days
of July viewing the collection, Murphy said.
   McGinty asked the jury to note testimony about keeping records
at the Library of Congress and National Archives and how government
records were stored before the archives opened in the 1930s.
   He said thousands of historic records were lost and stolen after
the Civil War because they were kept in basements, attics, and even
the White House garage.
   Records at the institutions show they should have possession of
numerous documents that actually are in private collections,
McGinty said.

<HEAD>Bowen Says Hospitals Engaging In `Medical Arms Race'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's top health officer said
Tuesday that hospitals have engaged in a kind of medical arms race
that assures neither quality care nor good value for the dollar.
   ``Sometimes you can save money and also improve care, like
concentrating certain procedures in hospitals that specialize in
them,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen.
``This not only leads to better results for the patient, it also
allows us to benefit from economies of scale.''
   Bowen's remarks to a conference of the Health Care Quality
Alliance followed a report by the 28-member coalition that
cautioned against emphasizing cost control to the point that the
``quality of care _ and quality of life _ are adversely affected.''
   The health secretary acknowledged that the government is
concerned about rising costs in the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
but said, ``We won't accomplish anything if we sacrifice quality
for lower costs.''
   ``One reason today's health care is so expensive is that the
financing of that care is little more than a collection of
disincentives to practice cost-effective medicine,'' he said.
   Bowen contended that ``hospitals, in order to attract doctors
and their patients, have bought and often duplicated the latest in
medical hardware in a kind of medical arms race.''
   Another reason for concern, he said, is that government tax
policies which do not tax employer-paid health insurance coverage
like some other fringe benefits ``have encouraged employers and
unions to bargain for ever-greater first-dollar coverage in health
insurance plans.''
   ``Compounding this folly,'' Bowen continued, ``most insurance
plans cover expensive high-tech procedures and slight preventive
services. And all of this has made patients and their families all
but oblivious to costs, since they pay so little out of pocket.''
   Turning to Medicare, he said creation of the program 23 years
ago ``created a powerful incentive for the health care industry to
develop the technology to treat the chronic, degenerative diseases
that afflict the aging.''
   Bowen said he was not suggesting those procedures are bad. ``On
the contrary,'' he said, ``They have improved the quality of life
for Americans of all ages.''
   ``Still to be decided is how much is too much. ... How much
heroic medical care and how many procedures to keep a dying patient
alive are desirable for the patient, the family and, not least of
all, for society at large? When is such care merely prolonging the
act of dying rather than contributing to longer life, or at least
some type of quality to it?''
   Bowen, a physician whose first wife died of cancer and whose
mother recently died in a nursing home, said: ``Sometimes our
high-tech capability lures us into pursuing expensive answers when
less costly ones are available. Our veneration of technology has
become a cultural blindspot that sometimes keeps us from pursuing
practical solutions to our problems.''
   The theme of the conference was ``Balancing Health Care Costs,
Quality, and Access: The Challenge for the Next Administration.''
   The alliance membership includes the American Medical
Association, the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders
Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the American Cancer Society,
the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Council on the
Aging.

East, but no firm decision; picks up at pvs 3rd grasf, ``State

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will
probably travel to the Middle East within two weeks if Israel
agrees to further discussions on his regional peace plan, an
Israeli diplomat said Tuesday.
   Asher Naim, the information minister at the Israeli Embassy,
said he expects Israel's cabinet will vote to keep alive the Shultz
peace initiative when the issue is debated.
   ``Apparently, Secretary Shultz will be in the Middle East ... in
two weeks time again,'' he told reporters at the National Press
Club.
   Israel will not reject the U.S. peace proposals, Naim said,
``and if the government indeed decides a neutral way _ that means
you continue negotiations _ then probably Secretary Shultz will go
to the Middle East.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Tuesday that
Shultz had not yet decided to return to the Mideast, where he
conducted a diplomatic shuttle last month.
   Another State Department official, who spoke only on condition
he not be named, said Shultz probably would make his decision by
the end of this week after being briefed by presidential envoy
Philip Habib about his tour of four Arab capitals. Habib visited
Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia this week, and is due back by
Thursday following a stop in Morocco.
   Habib will bring with him reactions from the Arab leaders to
Shultz's plan, which calls for Israeli-Arab talks to begin May 1 on
Palestinian self-rule, and for the next phase to start by Dec. 1 to
determine the future of the Israeli-occupied territories. So far,
Syria is the only party to have rejected the plan.
   Shultz's plans also may be shaped by his talks this week in
Washington with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
about the U.S. peace plan, which envisions international
sponsorship for the Arab-Israeli negotiations, the official said. A
group of U.S. and Soviet negotiators were scheduled to discuss the
Mideast on Wednesday, he said.
   Naim, addressing reporters at the National Press Club, said
Shultz would be coming back to the region because the Israeli
government will not reject his plan, despite internal divisions.
``They won't vote `no.' They'll probably decide to continue
negotiating about the plan,'' he said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who visited Washington
last week, rejects the international auspices proposed by Shultz
for the talks. His rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, has
accepted the plan.
   President Reagan, in an unusually blunt statement, warned Shamir
against rejecting the plan and said the United States would not
change its proposals to suit Shamir's reservations.
   But Naim hinted at one possible avenue for continued
negotiations with Israel over the Shultz plan. ``There are some
suggestions to cushion Israel's fears about an international
conference,'' he said.
   Naim was referring to proposed guarantees by the United States
that an international conference would not have any power to impose
solutions on Israel. Other U.S. officials have suggested these
guarantees would be included in a memorandum of understanding
between Israel and the United States.
   Redman said the United States also might promise Israel that the
guarantees would be binding on future administrations.
   ``We really have the sense that if we can get this thing moving,
that there really is no difficulty in having it move right across
the boundaries of one administraiton to another,'' he said.

   Congressional support for a $4.4 billion atom
smasher is dwindling rapidly because of budget constraints and
irritation with the site-selection process, House members said
Tuesday.
   Although seven states remain in the running for the
superconducting super collider, lawmakers say the huge project is
in jeopardy.
   Some even advocate that it be scrapped at once.
   ``Now that all but seven states have been eliminated from the
SSC site-selection process, the remaining states should help put an
end to the process,'' said Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa. ``It's time to
face up to the facts.''
   Testifying before the House Science, Space and Technology
Committee, Ritter said a financial commitment to the high-energy
physics project would endanger funds for scientific research in
other fields.
   Ritter, whose home state did not seek the project, said the
House Budget Committee recognized the conflict by appropriating
$100 million for the collider in fiscal 1989 rather than the $363
million President Reagan requested.
   Congressional delegations from the states picked as finalists
said Tuesday they are forming a task force to seek support for SSC
funding.
   ``My fear is we will end up with a site to build the SSC and no
funds for construction,'' said Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich.
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said that with the demand for
budget cuts and the current feelings of lawmakers whose states were
bypassed, ``it will be well-nigh impossible to pay for this thing.''
   The collider would be a 53-mile, underground ring of magnets
capable of whipping proton beams into each other with 20 times the
force of the world's most powerful existing accelerator.
   Scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from
studying the subatomic particles created by the proton collisions.
   The project is expected to bring thousands of construction jobs,
permanent employment for as many as 3,000 people and an annual
budget of $270 million to the host state.
   An independent panel appointed by the Department of Energy
reviewed 35 bids from 25 states before picking seven finalists:
Illinois, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina and
Tennessee.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington said he would announce a
tentative choice for the site in November and confirm the selection
in January 1989.
   But the science committee's chairman, Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J.,
told DOE Undersecretary Joseph Selgado at the hearing that ``a
question of credibility is arising'' about the selection process.
   He said said several lawmakers have complained that the
department failed to use the criteria it had established previously
when the seven finalists were chosen.

   Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr. told
students at a campaign stop Tuesday that combating illegal drugs
would take precedence in foreign policy if he is elected president.
   Gore told a crowded gathering at Traverse City High School that
he would use the military to stop the flow of drugs into the United
States.
   He said the nation's drug problem reflected ``a spiritual crisis
... an absence of hope.''
   ``We have to have the courage to say there's nothing more
important in our foreign policy than stopping'' illegal drugs, Gore
told the students. ``I'll change that and put the war on drugs at
the top of our foreign policy agenda.''
   He commented while campaigning in Michigan, where polls show him
trailing badly just four days before the state's Democratic
presidential caucuses.
   Earlier in the day, Gore canceled a speech at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison to return to Washington to cast a vote to
override President Reagan's veto of a civil rights bill.
   He also stopped in Harrisburg, Pa., where he met with Gov.
Robert P. Casey, who is neutral in the presidential race, and
received the endorsement of state legislative leaders.
   Gore said he was ``a little bit'' surprised at Vice President
George Bush's decision to go along with Reagan's civil rights veto.
   He added, ``When push comes to shove the vice president never
disagrees with President Reagan. I don't remember a time in eight
years when he has been willing to express any disagreement with the
president.
   ``He really has not carved out an identity of his own in this
election,'' Gore said.
   In Harrisburg, he called Pennsylvania ``an excellent opportunity
for a Gore victory.'' In Michigan, he said he expected to ``do
significantly better than expected.''
   Gore is running far behind in polls in Michigan, and he is
competing in the state without campaigning intensively. His
campaign has been airing radio commercials featuring an endorsement
by singer Johnny Cash, but has not aired television ads.
   He is running television commercials in Wisconsin, a state where
he figures to have a greater opportunity to demonstrate broad
appeal outside his native South. Gore is scheduled to speak to the
state Legislature in Madison, Wisc., on Wednesday.
   In Traverse City, Gore spoke to an overflow crowd of about 700
students at an event held after school had ended for the day. The
auditorium was filled with hand-lettered posters, such as one
saying, ``Al's your pal.''
   With him was the state House speaker Gary Owen, a Gore backer,
and the mayor of Traverse City, Bryan Crough, who also endorsed him.
   Gore's comments on drugs were in response to questions from
students. He pointed to the alleged involvement in massive drug
smuggling by Panama strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. He has
repeatedly accused the Reagan administration of having continued
support for Noriega even after it had evidence of drug involvement.

<TEXT>
   Early Senate ratification of the agreement
banning medium-range nuclear weapons worldwide hit a potentially
major roadblock Tuesday with the reopening of a long-festering
constitutional feud between Congress and the White House over the
interpretation of treaties.
   Several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
expressed dismay at the development. They said it could delay
ratification of the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF
Treaty until after the planned summit meeting later this spring
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   On another front, however, the Senate Intelligence Committee
reported unanimously that Soviet compliance with the new treaty can
be monitored with ``great certainty.''
   But the panel made clear that detecting Soviet efforts to cheat
on a future pact making sharp cuts in long-range strategic arms
would strain U.S. intelligence capabilites.
   The treaty interpretation controversy was raised in testimony
before the Foreign Relations panel by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Nunn said a recent letter from White House Counsel Arthur B.
Culvahouse Jr. effectively undercut previous assurances from
Secretary of State George P. Shultz that administration testimony
on the new pact is ``authoritative.''
   The dispute stems from the Reagan administration's unilateral
re-interpretation last year of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty with the Soviet Union in order to permit the deployment of a
``Star Wars'' missile defense system.
   The new Culvahouse letter undercuts the Shultz assurance, Nunn
told the committee, by asserting that some administration responses
may be less authoritative than others.
   Culvahouse suggested that the testimony of a secretary of state
may be more authoritative than that of other administration
witnesses or responses in writing to questions by members of
Congress, Nunn said.
   Culvahouse has since issued a second letter asserting that his
original remarks were not inconsistent with the Shultz statement.
But Nunn said he finds that unacceptable.
   ``It doesn't solve my problem,'' Nunn said. ``It simply asserts
there is no conflict. You can assert anything ... It puts the
Shultz statement in the trash can, saying that certain testimony is
not to be taken seriously.''
   He said the Culvahouse assertion casts doubt on the authority of
several administration interpretations on a list of ambiguities in
treaty language. That might have to be resolved point by point in a
time consuming process on the Senate floor, he said.
   Nunn said he believes the controversy must be resolved by the
full Senate and that another letter, even one from the president,
would not be acceptable.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said, ``This is the major
stumbling block and could create grave perils if we don't resolve
it.'' He predicted that the issue could result in a serious
partisan split inside the committee and in the Senate.
   ``It would be tragic if this treaty was destroyed because we had
a procedural dispute with the president,'' said Sen. Brock Adams,
D-Wash.
   The Intelligence Committee report was presented to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee as that panel prepared to consider a
series of amendments to the medium-range missile pact, the final
phase of a two-month process of intense examination.
   The treaty was signed by Reagan and Gorbachev on Dec. 8. It
eliminates nuclear-armed missiles with a range of between 300 miles
and 3,400 miles in Europe and elsewhere and provides the most
intrusive verification system in arms control history.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the Foreign Relations chairman,
said earlier he hoped the panel could complete its work by the end
of the week, sending the treaty to the Senate floor for a vote
expected sometime in April. Vote tallies in both parties predict
ratification by far more than the required two-thirds or 67 votes.
   The Intelligence Committee conducted its own review of treaty
provisions, concentrating on the U.S. capability to monitor Soviet
compliance with a variety of information-collecting techniques,
including the use of spy satellites and on-site inspection.
   ``The intelligence community will be able to monitor the
drawdown and elimination of declared Soviet missile launchers and
associated equipment with great certainty,'' the panel said in its
final report.
   But Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence panel's
chairman, said that effective verification of a future pact cutting
strategic intercontinental arms by up to 50 percent would require a
significant and expensive bolstering of U.S. intelligence
capabilities.
   The committee recommended ``investing more in programs that
would be most helpful in verifying a START treaty, in preventing
technological surprise and in supporting U.S. policy and operations
in crises,'' Boren said.
   Speaking for the committee, Boren said that because a Strategic
Arms Reduction or START treaty would not involve a ban on an entire
class of weapons but would rather impose limits on total numbers of
weapons that will make ``the detection of cheating far more
difficult.''
   The Intelligence Committee said also that the extensive on-site
inspection requirements of a strategic arms treaty _ with Soviet
inspectors given access to some of the most sensitive U.S. military
facilities _ could have a significant impact on U.S. intelligence
operations.
   It said that while it has overall confidence in the ability of
the U.S. to detect Soviet cheating on the INF treaty, ``Soviet
compliance with some of the treaty's provisions will be difficult
to verify.''
   The panel noted, for example, that a controversy between the
Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Afency
over the number of SS-20 missiles in the Soviet arsenal remains
unresolved, with the DIA estimating a larger number.
   But it said the treaty's ban on flight testing will ultimately
limit the utility of any covert SS-20 force.

   The United States should establish stronger
ties with the rightest party that won convincing victories in
municipal and legislative elections in El Salvador, a congressman
who monitored the weekend elections said Tuesday.
   Sunday's elections, which had a 70 percent voter turnout despite
threats of violence by leftist guerrillas, proved that the
Republican Nationalist Alliance will be a major force in El
Salvador, said Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn. The party, known by
its Spanish acronym Arena, won a majority of the elections over the
moderate Christian Democrat party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   ``We really need to concentrate on working with the Arena
political party,'' Rowland told reporters at a news briefing.
   ``We need to get more involved. We have invested there millions
and millions of dollars in foreign aid. It's the only country
that's had any democratic reform of significance over the last few
years. It would be a shame to see the whole thing fall apart,'' he
said.
   Rowland pointed to Arena's strong electoral support across a
wide cross-section of Salvadoran society and efforts by the party
to moderate its views. And he noted the low profile taken by former
army Maj. Robert d'Aubuisson, the party's controversial founder who
has been accused of links to Salvadoran death squads.
   ``My impression is that Arena is not as nearly as right ... as
we had originally suspected. There's tremendous support among the
people,'' Rowland said. ``There are some bad apples, of course,
within their party, but our information suggests that maybe they're
not the crazies that you might suspect.''
   Rowland was one of six House members who monitored the elections.
   ``Our observations concluded that it was a fair and open
election,'' he said.

   A jury Tuesday recommended a former state
trooper be sentenced to life in prison without parole for murdering
his trooper girlfriend, the first woman state trooper in the nation
slain while on duty.
   Circuit Judge J.C. Norton will not be bound by the jury's
recommendation when he sentences Joe Duncan, who was accused of
killing Elizabeth Cobb to collect $350,000 in life insurance.
   No date for sentencing was set immediately.
   Ten members of the Dallas County jury voted for life
imprisonment without parole, while two voted that Duncan should die
in the electric chair. The jury convicted Duncan of capital murder
Monday night after about three hours of deliberation.
   In a sentencing hearing Tuesday, Duncan's daughter pleaded that
his life be spared. ``He was _ he is _ the best father you could
have,'' 14-year-old Tanya Duncan said.
   Duncan, 33, was convicted of shooting Miss Cobb, 31, in the head
at close range Oct. 11. Her body was found the next day behind the
wheel of her patrol car, which was parked behind a rural church.
   At the time, the FBI described Miss Cobb as the first female
state trooper in the nation slain while on duty.
   Prosecutors charged that Duncan killed Miss Cobb for a $250,000
life insurance policy that paid an extra $100,000 if she died in
the line of duty. The slaying occurred 10 days after the policy
went into effect on the rookie trooper, with Duncan as beneficiary.
   Defense attorney Henry Pitts said the trial's most decisive
factor was evidence showing Duncan gave investigators conflicting
accounts before his arrest.
   Jurors saw a videotape that showed Duncan denying he knew
anything about Miss Cobb's death, and a second tape in which he
told investigators he found the slain trooper's body shortly after
she was killed. Duncan said he didn't tell anyone of finding her
body for fear he would be accused of the crime.

<HEAD>Idaho Rancher Says He Shot 40 Wild Ponies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT ISLAND, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty wild Welsh ponies were shot
dead and left to rot on this Great Salt Lake island because the
rancher who rents the island said he could not afford to capture
and move them.
   The carcasses were discovered Saturday by a private pilot on a
recreational flight, said Antelope State Park Superintendent Mitch
Larsson, who had gone to the island Monday, concerned the animals
may have died from disease.
   The uninhabited island was leased to rancher Dallen Ward last
fall, and Ward killed the horses to make way for sheep he plans to
move from his home in Almo, Idaho, said Weber County Sheriff's Lt.
Archie Smith.
   Ward said Monday that the horses were over-grazing the island,
and the cost of moving them was prohibitive.
   ``We looked at every avenue possible and economically I couldn't
do it,'' he said, explaining he would have had to hire a crew to
round up the horses and rent a barge to move them.
   He also said he could find no buyers for the animals.
   Ward said he shot the animals himself, but he refused to discuss
details.
   Bruce Dibb, an attorney for the owner of the island, Steven
Richards Sr., said the horses were introduced about 30 years ago
with commercial recreation in mind. However, the enterprise never
got off the ground and the horses became wild.
   Dibb said his client removed about 100 horses by barge last
year, but the others eluded capture.
   The shootings probably did not violate Utah law, said John Fox,
a special deputy for the Utah Humane Society. ``Unless it can be
proved the horses suffered or didn't pass out right away, it is
legal,'' he said.
   However, Fox said Ward may have violated the law by not burying
the horses within 48 hours, a misdemeanor.
   Smith said he planned to speak to Weber County Attorney Reed
Richards to determine whether charges should be filed.
   The ponies appeared to have been dead for about two weeks, said
Utah Veterinarian Michael Marshall, who accompanied Larsson to the
island Monday.
   ``There is no real danger from the carcasses other than maybe a
bird pecking on them, then flying across to the mainland with that
material,'' Marshall said. ``But I don't see any way to bury them.
You would have to airlift a backhoe over there to do it.''

   North Carolina's attorney general is
preparing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a state law
requiring professional fund-raisers for charities to tell potential
donors how the money will be used.
   The nation's highest court is scheduled to hear arguments
Wednesday on North Carolina's petition to reverse lower-court
rulings, which struck down the 1985 law as a violation of the First
Amendment's freedom of speech guarantee.
   Both sides agree that the outcome of the case could have a
nationwide impact on the professional fund-raising industry, which
Attorney General Lacy Thornburg called a
``multi-multimillion-dollar business,'' and on smaller charities
that lack personnel to raise money.
   ``It's really a question of survival,'' said Errol Copilevitz, a
Kansas City attorney representing the National Federation of the
Blind of North Carolina Inc. and the Optimist Club of North
Raleigh, N.C., which filed a lawsuit in 1985 challenging the law.
   About 75 charities have filed a friend-of-the-court brief
opposing the statute. Many are represented by Independent Sector,
an umbrella group including such organizations as the American Red
Cross and the American Cancer Society, Copilevitz said Tuesday.
   Thornburg said Maine, Connecticut, Indiana and West Virginia had
filed briefs in support of North Carolina's law.
   The most controversial provision requires professional
fund-raisers to tell people they solicit what portion of the money
will be spent on the charitable cause and how much will be used to
cover expenses.
   ``The purpose of the law is to promote honesty through
disclosure ... in very much the same way that banks and other
institutions are required to tell, for example, what their interest
rate is going to be,'' Thornburg said at a news conference.
   A study of fund-raising campaigns conducted in North Carolina by
professionals on behalf of charities between 1980 and 1984 showed
that, on average, only 13 percent of gross receipts were returned
to the charities, he said.
   The law presumes that whenever a professional group retains 35
percent or more of the gross receipts, it has reaped an excess
profit, Thornburg said.
   The Solicitations Licensing Branch of the state Department of
Human Resources is empowered to increase the charity's share if it
finds excessive profit for the fund-raisers.
   If allowed to stand, the law would bolster public confidence in
charities, Thornburg said. ``We feel that if a donor knows in
advance what portion of the funds are going back to the charity,
then they will much more freely give.''
   But Wayne Shevlin, president of the Raleigh chapter of the
National Federation of the Blind of North Carolina Inc., disagreed.
   ``If the first thing you have to say is how much is going for
expenses, most people ... are going to hang up before you've had a
chance to go through the spiel,'' Shevlin said.
   The law might drive out of business many small- and medium-sized
charities, he said.
   Copilevitz said most potential donors who want information on
how the money will be spent ask for it. Many states _ including
North Carolina _ require professional and amateur fund-raising
groups to provide such details on request, he said.
   Most states regulate fund solicitation, he said, but North
Carolina's law goes far beyond any other.
   U.S. District Judge Earl Britt struck down the measure as
unconstitutional on May 14, 1986, a finding upheld by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., on April 23, 1987.

   Federal fuel-economy standards will cause
thousands of traffic deaths next year by discouraging the use of
safer, larger cars, two researchers said Tuesday as the government
reported a slight increase in auto fuel efficiency last year.
   ``Fuel economy regulation inevitably leads to smaller, lighter
cars that are inherently less safe than the cars that would be
produced without a binding fuel-economy constraint,'' said a study
by Robert W. Crandall of the Brookings Institution in Washington
and John D. Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.
   They estimated the standards would cause 2,200 to 3,900 traffic
deaths next year.
   Also Tuesday, the Transportation Department told Congress that
passenger cars sold in the United States got 28.2 miles per gallon
last year overall, up 0.2 miles per gallon from the previous year.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said Americans tended to
buy slightly heavier, higher performance cars last year than in
prior years, and imports showed a shift way from subcompacts to
compacts, increasing their market share by 8 percentage points.
   Among the Big Three automakers, Chrysler Corp. had the most fuel
efficient cars fleetwide in 1987, at 27.6 mpg, down from 27.8 mpg
in 1986.
   Ford Motor Co. had a fuel-economy of 26.8 mpg, unchanged from
the previous year, and General Motors Corp.'s was 26.4 mpg, up from
26.2 mpg the previous year.
   Weighted by sales, imports had an fuel economy of 31 mpg, down
from 31.7 mpg the previous year.
   Domestic cars averaged 26.7 mpg, up from 26.6 mpg the year
before.
   Burnley used the report to reiterate his support for elimination
of the fuel-economy requirement, saying it placed U.S.
manufacturers at a disadvantage against their foreign competition.
   ``The greatest contribution we can make to keeping jobs in the
United States and to making the domestic auto industry competitive
on a worldwide basis is to repeal the (fuel economy) rules,''
Burnley said. ``Thousands of American jobs are threatened because
of an anachronistic law that is doing substantial harm to our
economy and our trade balance.''
   The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards _ CAFE for short _
from 1978 sought to encourage more fuel efficient cars and thereby
reduce petroleum use at a time of shortages and soaring prices.
   The required fuel economy this year is 26 mpg of gasoline.
Manufacturers that fail to meet the standards are liable to fines.
   Using mathematical models, Crandall and Graham estimated the
CAFE standards had reduced the weight of cars by 500 pounds, to
3,100 pounds, despite sharp declines in oil prices after 1981 that
in an unregulated market would be expected to encourage manufacture
of larger cars.
   That decline in weight ``caused by CAFE is associated with a 14
to 27 percent increase in occupant fatality risk,'' the study said.
They applied that range to existing traffic fatality figures to
make their estimate of the number of additional deaths likely in
1989.
   The estimate took into account such factors as the tendency of
occupants of smaller cars, compared with those of larger cars, to
buckle their safety belts, the study said.
   The study also said the CAFE standards, by raising the cost of
desirable high-performance cars, have encouraged people to drive
their cars longer, extending ``the useful life of older, less safe
and higher-pollution cars.''
   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., said at a news conference marking the
study's release he hopes the conclusions will help win support for
legislation he introduced last year to abolish the CAFE standards.
   ``Congress is not the place to design auto models,'' Carr said,
acknowledging the bill's chances of passage this year are slim.
   The study by Crandall and Graham is scheduled for publication
next year in The Journal of Law and Economics.
   The study was released by the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
a public-issues group espousng free-market principles. Crandall and
Graham said they did the study without funds from the institute.

   The Justice Department sued Tuesday to force the
Palestine Liberation Organization to close its mission to the
United Nations, and the PLO envoy defiantly responded that he could
live on the street as a refugee.
   The government sought a federal court order barring the PLO;
Zehdi Labib Terzi, head of the PLO's observer mission; and five
other PLO officials or employees from continuing to operate the
mission or any PLO office in Manhattan or at any other location.
   The action is required under the 1987 Anti-Terrorism Act, which
found the PLO and its affiliates were a terrorist organization
responsible for numerous violent incidents, including the murder of
an American citizen during the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille
Lauro in 1985.
   Terzi said he would have no comment on the PLO's possible legal
response until he reads the complaint.
   ``The only asset we have in this country is the building we live
in,'' he told reporters. ``Maybe they want me to live on the
street, but this would not be the first time the Palestinians
become refugees.''
   He called efforts to freeze PLO funds ``financial terrorism to
strangle us.''
   Earlier Tuesday, he had said, ``If they force me to leave, I
will have to move to the United Nations'' on international
territory, out of reach of U.S. marshals. In 1973, PLO Chief Yasser
Arafat spent a night at the United Nations because he could not
stay on U.S. territory.
   In Amman, Jordan, PLO foreign affairs spokesman Farouk Kaddoumi
said Tuesday before the suit was filed,:``We will keep the office
open until the American police seal it off. Then we will go to the
United Nations and live there.
   ``This will become a continuous headache to the U.S.
administration,'' said Kaddoumi.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the PLO's legal
counsel, was not available for comment, his office said Tuesday.
Clark did not immediately return messages left at the office.
   Clark has said, however, that he would seek to have the federal
complaint dismissed on grounds that U.S. courts lack jurisdiction
in the matter involving an international treaty, in this instance
between the United States and the United Nations.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he would have to
wait until the U.N. General Assembly adopts a resolution Wednesday
before commenting on possible legal action.
   The 159-member General Assembly is to vote on a resolution
supporting the PLO's right to operate and deploring U.S. moves to
shut the mission. The draft of the resolution calls on the
secretary-general to take measures to allow the PLO to carry out
its official functions as a U.N. invitee.
   In a separate action last September, the State Department
ordered the closing of the PLO's information office in Washington.
That was before Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism Act, which
President Reagan signed on Dec. 22. The law took effect Monday.
   Under the law, Congress determined that ``the PLO and its
affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat to the
interests of the United States, its allies and to international law
and should not benefit from operating in the United States.''
   Earlier this month, Secretary of State George Shultz called the
act ``one of the dumber things that the Congress has done lately.''

   A lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that an
underground prison facility for women in Lexington, Ky., was
designed specifically to house political activists and that inmates
are subjected to inhumane treatment.
   Civil liberties groups filed the suit in U.S. District Court
here against nine federal officials, including Attorney General
Edwin Meese III. It seeks the immediate transfer of the inmates
from the high-security facility to the general population of a
federal women's prison.
   The Lexington Control Unit opened in November 1986, now houses
five inmates and contains 16 basement cells constructed beneath the
federal prison at Lexington. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons said last
October it will phase out the unit, the only high-security unit for
women in the federal prison system.
   ``The primary purpose for the creation of the unit was to
confine prisoners whose political associations and affiliations
were determined to pose a security threat,'' said the suit,
alleging violation of the women's constitutional rights. ``All the
women in the unit are suffering psychological and physical harm as
a direct consequence of their isolated confinement in this
underground segregation unit.''
   A new medium- and high-security facility for women will be
opened in June in Marianna, Fla., and the phaseout in Lexington
will be completed shortly thereafter, said Bureau of Prisons
spokeswoman Kathryn Morse. She declined to comment on the suit.
   The ``small basement facility'' has ``virtually no natural
light'' and is illuminated 24 hours a day by fluorescent lights,
said the suit, prepared by the National Prison Project of the
American Civil Liberties Union and other attorneys.
   The women, the suit said, are monitored continuously by staff
and video cameras, have no opportunity to participate in any of the
activities available to the general prison population and are
subjected to random strip searches.
   ``We believe the women's lives are in danger,'' said Susan
Waysdorf, a spokeswoman for civil libertarians supporting the suit.
``They're beginning to experience signs of behavior modification,
general disorientation, vision problems, loss of appetite,
sleeplessnes.''
   Among the inmates are Silvia Baraldini, convicted of
racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a $1.6 million Brink's
armored car heist in Nyack, N.Y., that left a guard and two police
officers dead. Another inmate at Lexington is Susan Rosenberg,
linked by law enforcement officers to the same bungled Brink's
robbery.
   Baraldini, serving a 43-year term, was transferred to Lexington
after refusing to be interviewed by an FBI agent, the suit said.
   Rosenberg, serving a 58-year term for possession of weapons and
explosives in connection with a 1985 police raid in New Jersey, was
told that she would be confined to the unit until she changes her
political beliefs, the suit alleges.
   When civil liberties groups began to expose Lexington as a
``political prison, federal officials hurriedly brought in two
other women serving long sentences,'' a coalition of prominent
civil libertarians said in a statement about the Lexington unit.
   One of the women brought in later, Sylvia Brown, serving a
27-year term for violating probation and escaping from a federal
prison, was told that her release from the unit would depend on her
lack of interaction with the political activists, the suit added.

   President Reagan harshly criticized the
process of gerrymandering on Tuesday, complaining that Republicans
are getting short-shrift treatment in the redrawing of
congressional boundary lines..
   ``I promise you this: As far as the president of the United
States is concerned, he's not going to be sitting around his garden
sniffing roses in 1988,'' Reagan told a group of Republican elected
officials.
   ``I'm going to be out on the campaign trail, telling the
American people the truth about how the electoral process has been
twisted and distorted,'' he said.
   Reagan noted that reapportionment is scheduled in 1991, and said
that ``having Republicans in state and local offices is the only
hope we have of getting a fair deal. And that's what we're asking
for -  an end to the anti-democratic and un-American practice of
gerrymandering congressional districts.''
   Gerrymandering is the political process by which congressional
district lines are redrawn in such a fashion as to benefit the
party in power, whether Democratic or Republican.
   Reagan said there were 367 congressional races contested by both
major political parties in 1984. In these contests, the president
said, Republicans won half a million votes more than Democrats, but
the Democrats won 31 more seats.
   In his remarks, Reagan said that ``gerrymandering has become a
national scandal. The Democratic-controlled state legislatures have
so rigged the electoral process that the will of the people cannot
be heard. They vote Republican but elect Democrats.''
   The president maintained that ``the congressional map is a
horror show of grotesque, contorted shapes. District lines jump
back and forth over mountain ranges, cross large bodies of water,
send out little tentacles to absorb special communities and ensure
safe seats.''
   Reagan said that while Republican Party Chairman Frank
Fahrenkopf has challenged Democratic gerrymandering in courts,
``ultimately, it's in the state legislatures that the battle for
fairness must be won. And that's why Republicans are going to have
to campaign with all our heart and soul for Republican state
legislative candidates.''
   Reagan has steadfastly refused to take sides in the competition
for the Republican Party nomination to succeed him, but has
indicated he will campaign actively for the nominee.
   In his talk Tuesday, the president signaled that he would hit
the campaign trail for an array of other causes, including his plan
to speak out against the practice of gerrymandering.

   Nicaragua's defense minister, Gen.
Humberto Ortega, said at the end of a second day of peace talks
between Sandinista and Contra rebel negotiators that he expected a
``concrete agreement'' on Wednesday.
   He declined to elaborate, telling a news conference, ``Obviously
we aren't able to go into details.''
   Earlier Tuesday both sides said they had exchanged proposals,
which agree on major points, for an extended cease-fire accompanied
by amnesty and release of political prisoners.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero told reporters, ``We worked hard
during the day. We clarified (points that coincide) and we are
working on differences.''
   ``It was a fruitful day and tomorrow could be even better.''
   Calero described the second round of talks as ``direct and
frank.''
   The two sides began three days of meetings Monday at this town
on the Costa Rican border, trying to end a civil war that President
Daniel Ortega says has cost 26,500 lives since 1981. Both sides
suspended battlefield action during the talks.
   The Sandinista delegation proposed a 30-day truce that could be
extended to three months, during which the U.S.-supported Contras
would lay down their weapons and join a ``national reconciliation
dialogue.''
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, the deputy foreign minister, announced the
proposal at a news conference. For every rebel who stops fighting,
he said, the leftist government will free one of the 3,300
political prisoners it considers eligible for release.
   Most prisoners are former members of the National Guard, as the
army was called under the late President Anastasio Somoza, whom the
Sandinista revolution overthrew in July 1979.
   Contrary to previous Sandinista demands, Tinoco said rebels who
put down their arms would be free from prosecution without applying
for amnesty and could take party in Nicaraguan political life.
   They would be permitted to operate uncensored newspapers,
magazines and radio stations, but television would remain a
government monopoly.
   Contra proposals, as outlined to reporters by spokesman Bosco
Matamoros, call for a 45-day truce beginning on Good Friday, April
1. Rebel fighters would move to cease-fire zones and a permanent
truce would be negotiated by Sandinista and Contra leaders.
   Matamoros said the Contras demand ``total and unconditional
amnesty'' when the cease-fire begins, so anyone who had left
Nicaragua for political reasons could ``rejoin the political,
economic and social process without any conditions.''
   Contra leaders also want to join a national dialogue between the
Sandinistas and their internal political opponents.
   An agreement signed Monday night by President Ortega, the
defense minister's brother, and leaders of eight opposition
political parties has a significant effect on that Contra demand.
   It says the parties pledge to discuss ``internal political
issues exclusively with the government'' and the ``government will
discuss exclusively with rebel groups'' all matters involving a
cease-fire.
   According to Matamoros, other Contra demands include immediate,
total amnesty, freedom for all political prisoners and an end to
mandatory military service.
   Tinoco said: ``At the moment at which a cease-fire is signed,
whether it be for 30, 60 or 90 days, according to what the
counterrevolution wants, at that moment the leadership of the
Nicaraguan Resistance (Contras) will be able to rejoin civic and
political life and even participate in the national dialogue that
seeks a reconciliation of all Nicaraguans.''
   Both sides propose international monitoring of the cease-fire.
The Sandinistas would have a 15-member international commission
including representatives of the United Nations, Organization of
American States, Contadora and its support group.
   Contadora is made up of Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama,
and began trying to negotiate peace in Central America several
years ago. The support group is Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Peru.
   The battlefield truce appeared on Tuesday to be holding. It was
the first agreed suspension of fighting since truce for Christmas
and New Year's during which some fighting was reported.
   Alfredo Cesar, a former Sandinista who leads the Contra
delegation, called the exchange of proposals ``a step ahead.'' On
Monday night, he told reporters: ``Neither side seeks a military
victory over the other.''
   Both cease-fire and reconciliation talks are required under the
peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the five Central American presidents.
It also calls for greater democracy in the region and an end to
both foreign aid to insurgents and the use of one country's
territory for attacks on another.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Nicaragua's Roman Catholic
primate, is attending the talks as one of two observers.
   He acted as mediator in four previous cease-fire conferences in
which the sides did not meet face-to-face. They were held outside
Nicaragua and ended without agreement.
   The other observer is Joao Baena Soarez, general secretary of
the Organization of American States.

   The battle for first place in the Michigan
caucuses will heat up the airwaves Thursday as Jesse Jackson goes
on television with an ad featuring Bill Cosby and Michael Dukakis
counters with a radio ad featuring Detroit Mayor Coleman Young.
   Jackson's campaign is spending about $90,000 in the last 48
hours before the Saturday voting across the state, said spokeswoman
Pam Smith.
   One of the major parts of the $70,000 television buy will be an
ad featuring an endorsment by Cosby, the popular television star.
The ad was run first before the Iowa caucuses and was run across
the South before Super Tuesday.
   Smith said the Jackson television buy will be divided equally
between Detroit television and other markets across Michigan. The
$20,000 radio buy will be spread across the state she said.
   Dukakis' campaign, which has already been on the air in
Michigan, will start running an ad featuring the endorsement of the
Massachusetts governor by Young, Detroit's longtime mayor. Bob
Boorstein, a Dukakis aide, said the radio ad will air on radio
stations around the metropolitan area through Saturday.
   Dukakis has been running a biographical television ad for the
last week in Michigan. Boorstein said the campaign added an ad
emphasizing Dukakis' executive experience _ contrasting that to the
legislative experience of his rivals.

   North Carolina should encourage students to
finish high school by denying driver's licenses to people under the
age of 18 who drop out, the lieutenant governor said Tuesday.
   Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan, a Democrat who plans to run against
Republican Gov. Jim Martin in the Nov. 8 general election, held a
series of news conferences across the state to introduce a package
aimed at reducing the state's dropout rate.
   Jordan is expected to win the Democratic nomination in the May 3
primary. Martin has no opposition.
   A similar bill failed during the 1987 legislative session, but
Jordan said he was confident he could steer the measure through the
Democrat-dominated General Assembly.
   Jordan said Martin had made no proposals to reduce the dropout
rate although during his term nearly 100,000 youngsters _ one
student in four _ have left school without a diploma.
   Martin told reporters Jordan's proposal was reasonable and
interesting but said he did not know whether it would work.
   Jordan said that if elected he would set a goal of halving the
rate by 1992.
   The driver's license provision would give young people an
incentive to remain in school, Jordan said. Under the proposed law,
dropouts would have to wait until their 18th birthday to get a
license, while those still in school could take the license test at
age 16.
   ``The state of North Carolina should do what a lot of parents
do,'' he said. ``When their kids don't study or don't do well in
school, they take away some privileges. Some parents take away
their car keys.''
   Jordan's package also includes hiring more guidance counselors
and additional technical training.

   A cold front off the northern Pacific Coast on Tuesday stirred
up strong wind, while the central Plains and southern third of the
nation enjoyed unseasonable warmth.
   Winds of 20 to 40 mph were common along the Washington state
coast, where a storm warning was in effect for coastal waters. A
gale warning was posted for the Oregon coast.
   A low pressure system over eastern South Dakota produced strong
northerly wind across western South Dakota and the central high
Plains with speeds of 25 to 40 mph. A gust of 49 mph was clocked
late Tuesday morning at Rapid City, S.D.
   Strong southerly wind at 20 to 35 mph reached from central Texas
across eastern Kansas and western and northern Missouri into
southeastern Iowa and northern Illinois.
   Rain fell in western Washington and Oregon, with snow in the
mountains expected to amount to 6 to 10 inches in the Cascades.
   Precipitation elsewhere was very light and spotty. Clear to
partly cloudy skies prevailed in the North and East.
   Unseasonably warm weather extended across the southern third of
the country and the central Plains, with midday temperatures mostly
in the 70s and low 80s.
   After some record cold temperatures for the date in the
Northeast on Tuesday morning, a warming trend began in the
afternoon and was expected to continue through Wednesday. Midday
temperatures climbed into the upper 20s and 30s from the Great
Lakes region to the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST Tuesday ranged from
23 degrees at Saranac Lake, N.Y.; Caribou, Maine; and Limestone,
Maine, to 88 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The early-morning low
was 15 degrees below zero at Saranac Lake, N.Y.
   The national weather forecast for Wednesday called for rain
showers, with snow showers in the mountains, from the Pacific
Northwest across the northern Rockies. Snow was predicted in parts
of Minnesota, scattered showers and thunderstorms in northeast
Texas across Missouri into Michigan, and scattered showers and rain
from the lower Great Lakes through New England.
   High temperatures in the 30s and 40s were forecast across most
of the northern tier of states, in the 70s and 80s across the
southern third of the country, 90s in the Southwest deserts, and in
the 50s and 60s across most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Newspaper, Communist Leader Call For Papal Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Danas, an influential weekly
newspaper in Zagreb, on Tuesday called for Pope John Paul II to
visit Communist Yugoslavia.
   It said in an editorial, ``In Slovenia there is not a single
serious reason against a papal visit.... If there are reasons
elsewhere against the pope's trip, then these should be dealt with
in a public discussion.''
   If John Paul should come to Yugoslavia, he probably would visit
only Slovenia and Croatia, the two northern republics that are
predominantly Roman Catholic, according to Danas.
   At the annual meeting last week of the Slovenian Socialist
Alliance, a Communist-led organization, alliance Secretary-General
Joze Smole said it was time to do ``everying possible'' to arrange
a papal visit.
   Danas noted allegations that Croatian authorities were opposed
to a papal visit and said the decision could not be made by one
republic alone.
   It is expected that if the pope visits Croatia, he would honor
the late Cardinal Aloisius Stepinac, who was convicted of
collaborating with Nazi troops in World War II. The cardinal died
under house arrest in his native village and his body was buried in
the Zagreb cathedral.
   Danas said there have been 11 visits to the Vatican in the past
year by Yugoslav state representatives, compared to one by a
ranking Catholic leader _ Cardinal Agostino Casaroli's visit to
Djakovo, Croatia, in 1985 to mark a St. Method's anniversary.
   Smole said Yugoslavia ``should at least honor the principle of
reciprocity in its relations with the Holy See.''
   Government officials have said a papal visit could take place
when agreement is reached on all conditions.
   There was speculation that such a visit was discussed when
Premier Branko Mikulic had a 30-minute audience with the pontiff on
Jan.30.
   Danas said the clergy of the Orthodox Church and atheists
probably ``would not gladly see the pope in Yugoslavia, but the
opposition does not come from these quarters alone.
   ``The situation in Yugoslavia is so complex that a papal visit,
unless it gained a kind of (national) consensus, would indeed
become a motive for political showdowns.''

   Press conditions in
Haiti improved after the Duvalier dictatorship fell, but a
restrictive code and government intimidation still cause concern,
the Inter-American Press Association said Tuesday.
   An IAPA delegation said that after President Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled to exile in France in 1986, ending 29 years of harsh
rule by the Duvalier family, radio stations and newspapers
flourished.
   Local newspapers resumed political commentary. Bans were lifted
on newspapers published abroad by exiles. Radio stations _ the main
source of news in a country where illiteracy approaches 80 percent
_ rehired staff members who had been deported or hounded into exile.
   ``When Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti in February 1986, the
media, like Haitians in general, assumed that they had democracy
and acted accordingly,'' Harold Hoyte, managing director of the
Barbados Nation, told the IAPA.
   ``Haitian publishers, radio and TV station directors, opposition
leaders and officials all agree that there was, in fact, almost
total freedom,'' said Hoyte, who traveled to Haiti on March 17-18
and spoke with newly elected President Leslie Manigat and many
others.
   The sense of journalistic freedom changed when the provisional
government, a military-led junta, issued a press code in July 1986.
It required journalists to have university degrees, declare news
sources, and be accredited annually.
   Haitian reporters told the delegation the code raised concern.
They also expressed concern about recent communiques from the
Information Ministry and armed forces cautioning the news media
about publishing or broadcasting reports from abroad that might be
perceived as negative to the image of Haiti or its leaders.
   ``Managers of newspapers, radio and television stations were
almost unanimous that there is now self-censorship of certain news,
and an awareness that to offend the army is to risk new
repression,'' Hoyte said.
   He said Manigat supports the press code and ``brushed aside the
delegation's arguments that the best press law would be no press
law at all.''
   In general, Hoyte said, ``the delegation was satisfied that
conditions for the press in Haiti are much better than those under
the Duvalier dictatorship, but also notes with concern the
atmosphere of intimidation and mistrust, and the prospect of a new
press law which will maintain some of the present limitations.''
   Three delegation members stopped off in Port-au-Prince last week
before going on the Dominican Republic for the IAPA meeting. The
others besides Hoyte were Wilbur Landrey, foreign editor of the St.
Petersburg (Fla.) Times and chairman of the IAPA freedom of the
press committee, and IAPA President Ignacio Lozano, editor of La
Opinion in Los Angeles, Calif.

Threats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor accused of fabricating death
threats against herself during extradition proceedings for two
Sikhs charged with terrorism gave FBI agents a description used to
make a sketch of a suspect, a lawyer for the Sikhs said Tuesday.
   The FBI showed the sketch to several New Jersey Sikhs during an
investigation of the threats against special Assistant U.S.
Attorney Judy G. Russell, and one was ordered to appear before a
federal grand jury, said lawyer Ronald Kuby.
   Kuby represents Sukhminder Singh. He and Ranjit Singh Gill are
accused of terrorism in India.
   A federal magistrate ruled in February that Gill and Singh could
be extradited. The hearings were conducted amid tight security
partly prompted by the threats to Ms. Russell and an anonymous
letter sent to the magistrate, Ronald J. Hedges.
   In a hearing before Hedges on Monday, U.S. Attorney Samuel A.
Alito Jr. said there was evidence that Ms. Russell may have
manufactured the threats.
   Laboratory tests found the same typewriter was used to address
the envelopes and to fill out Ms. Russell's application to the
Justice Department in 1983. The typewriter was found in her home
along with three similar letters in envelopes, as well as materials
apparently used to make the letters out of words cut from
newspapers and magazines, the prosecutor said.
   Ms. Russell, who left the U.S. attorney's office before the
hearings began but handled the case as a special assistant, is in a
private hospital. Her attorney, Robert J. Fettweis, has declined to
comment.
   Federal authorities have said they would request a new
extradition hearing to avoid the appearance of impropriety, and
were considering how much of the proceedings should be repeated.
   Kuby said Tuesday he wanted all pretrial arguments repeated
before a new magistrate and possibly outside of New Jersey.
   At Monday's hearing, Alito said the allegations about Ms.
Russell have no bearing on the case's final outcome.
   During the investigation into the threats, Kuby said, one of his
clients, Amarvir ``Sonny'' Singh, was ordered to appear before a
Newark grand jury investigating the threats.
   ``They didn't question him, they just viewed him'' to see if he
matched the sketch, Kuby said. Amarvir Singh was later told by
investigators not to return for a lineup, Kuby said.
   The lawyer said agents told Sikhs they interviewed that the
sketch was based on Ms. Russell's description of a man who shouted
a threat at her in a shopping mall.
   First Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said he would not
comment on the shouted threat because it was not on the public
record. FBI spokesman Michael Mines said he would not comment on a
continuing investigation.
   Jagjit Singh Mangat, president of the New York-based Sikh
Cultural Society, said FBI agents apologized to those who were
questioned about the alleged threats.
   The allegations ``damaged the Sikh community quite a bit,''
Mangat said. ``Everybody is looking at us as a terrorist, but we
are not.''
   Justice Department officials outside of the U.S. attorney's
office in Newark are investigating the Russell case, and have the
power to pursue an indictment, Chertoff said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Dismisses Motion to Remove Case from Bankruptcy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge on Tuesday gave Bishop College two months
to come up with $200,000, but rejected a motion to take the
struggling school out of protection of Bankruptcy Court.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Trustee George McElreath had sought to
dismiss the school's Chapter 11 reorganization petition. That would
have left Bishop vulnerable to lawsuits from its 400 creditors, who
are owed more than $12.5 million.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert McGuire, in denying
McElreath's motion, ordered the school to raise $50,000 every two
weeks beginning April 5. If the school cannot prove it has the cash
on hand within three days of each deadline, he will reconsider the
motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 petition.
   ``It's a good deal,'' said Bishop attorney T. Glover Roberts.
``It's incentive for the school, especially the students, to do
something.''
   Roberts said the school, which has failed to meet its payroll
for two months, has operating expenses of $200,000 a month and
would not have survived if the trustee's motion had been granted.
   ``Bishop is in a deeper and deeper financial hole,'' Roberts
said.
   Observers in the packed courtroom, mostly Bishop students and
faculty, applauded McGuire's ruling. Afterward, many joined in
singing the school's alma mater in the courthouse lobby.
   Judith Swift, attorney for Bishop's largest creditor, its
faculty-staff committee, praised the judge's ruling.
   ``Clearly the debtor is in violation on matters of legal
concern, but law is about equity, too,'' Swift said. ``The equity
here is the human concerns of the students and faculty.''
   Swift told the judge that 28 of the school's approximately 50
faculty and staff members had agreed to work without pay for the
rest of the term if Bishop was allowed to stay open.
   Only two creditors joined McElreath's motion to dismiss the
Chapter 11 protection.
   Though he rejected the motion, the judge said McElreath was
right to carry out his duty as court-appointed trustee to point out
Bishop's violations of the bankruptcy filing. The most notable, the
judge said, was the accrual of nearly $700,000 in new debt since
the school filed for protection last May.
   School officials are hoping for aid from the U.S. Department of
Education, which is expected to decide next week whether to renew
$400,000 in funding for the school. That funding was lost last year
when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools failed to
renew Bishop's academic accreditation because of its financial
problems.
   Bishop's board of trustees voted earlier Tuesday to allow
conversion of the school's bankruptcy filing from Chapter 11 to
Chapter 7 at the end of the spring semester in late May unless the
school's dire financial situation changes.
   Under Chapter 7, Bishop would close and its assets would be sold
to pay creditors.
   School officials are also working to get back $150,000 from two
churches that recently withdrew donations. The churches backed out
after Dallas businessman Clifford Sugerman reneged on a $300,000
pledge.
   Sugerman had promised to match donations up to that amount.
   Sugerman, whose Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition filed in 1985 is
still an open case, gave no reason for dropping the pledge and his
Sugarman Foundation is now under investigation by the state
attorney general's office.
   Bishop College, affiliated with the National Baptist Churches,
was founded as a college for blacks in 1861. It currently has about
300 students.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha
apologized on behalf of the government Tuesday for a police search
of the West German consul's home, but also criticized West
Germany's policies.
   Police searched the home of Erhard Loeser, West Germany's acting
consul-general, on Monday. They were looking for Heinrich
Grosskopf, a 24-year-old white South African accused of a
car-bombing last week that killed three people.
   Officials claim Grosskopf carried out that bombing and at least
one other on orders from the outlawed African National Congress,
the predominantly black guerrilla group fighting to end domination
by South Africa's white minority.
   Botha gave no reason why police decided to search Loeser's home
and coupled his apology with an attack on Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany for suggesting a boycott of
South African products as a means of protesting the apartheid
racial policy.
   He said the suggestion was ``callously irresponsible'' and a
boycott would ``deprive people of their livelihood.''
   The foreign minister also criticized Genscher for questioning
the fairness of legal proceedings for the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a
group of blacks granted a one-month stay of execution last week.
They were convicted of complicity in the mob killing of a black
official.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Congress overrode President Reagan's veto of a
major civil rights bill Tuesday, ending a four-year battle to
restore broad protection for women, minorities, the elderly and the
handicapped.
   A 73-24 vote in the Senate, followed by a 292-133 tally in the
House, handed Reagan a severe political defeat and reversed a 1984
Supreme Court decision that sharply restricted the reach of four
anti-discrimination statutes.
   The votes in both chambers exceeded the two-thirds majority
needed to enact a law over a presidential veto. It was the ninth
time Congress had rejected a Reagan veto.
   The White House pledged to enforce the new law, which Reagan had
called a federal ``power grab.''
   ``We presented an alternative civil rights act which stated the
president's strong views against discrimination in this country,''
a White House statement said. ``The Congress chose to override the
president's veto. We will work to implement the new law.''
   ``People who voluntarily take federal funds have an obligation
to treat everybody else fairly,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
summing up the rationale of lawmakers who have been pressing for
the Civil Rights Restoration Act since the high court ruling.
   The Moral Majority, which had campaigned against the bill, said
after the vote that the legislation would cause ``severe damage to
the free exercise of religion'' and ``will put at risk our other
guaranteed freedoms.''
   The court said only specific programs or activities receiving
federal aid had to comply with four major civil rights laws.
   The restoration act bars discrimination by institutions,
government agencies and some corporations that receive any federal
aid. That means if a college physics department, for example,
receives federal assistance, the entire college would fall under
the civil rights laws.
   Reagan and his congressional allies argued for a less sweeping
alternative, saying the act went far beyond simple restoration.
They said it would curtail religious liberty and expand federal
control over the private sector.
   ``It's a blank check to the bureaucrats and the litigators,''
said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said in a statement that
Reagan's veto was ``wholly unnecessary and it provoked an
unnecessary confrontation. The new law will not end illegal
discrimination. But it does represent a step forward in making
America truly a land of equal opportunity for all.''
   Supporters in the House erupted into cheers and applause when
the two-thirds mark was reached. In the Senate, the mood was more
subdued.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chief Senate sponsor of the bill,
said the Senate had demonstrated that ``this country does not want
to retreat on protections of rights for the American people.''
   The opposition leader, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said:
``Sometimes you win some and sometimes you lose some. That's the
nature of our process.''
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the 185-group Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, called the votes ``a bipartisan
reaffirmation of civil rights and a bipartisan repudiation of the
civil rights extremism of the Reagan-Bush administration. It was a
great victory for civil rights and for the nation.''
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, however, said the bill ``does
little to protect these basic rights'' and may end up ``imposing
unncessary regulatory burdens'' on businesses, farmers and others.
   Opponents contended the bill had little to do with civil rights
and had much to do with what Reagan on Tuesday called ``a power
grab by Washington, designed to take control away from states,
localities, communities, parents and the private sector and give it
to federal bureaucrats and judges.''
   Reagan had proposed an alternative last week that would enable
more institutions to escape regulation on religious grounds and
limit most corporate compliance requirements to specific plants or
facilities receiving federal aid.
   As they voted Tuesday, many lawmakers, even some who voted to
sustain Reagan's veto, denounced a last-minute campaign against the
restoration act by the conservative Moral Majority.
   They said they received hundreds of calls from people who said
they had been told the bill would force them to hire homosexual
ministers and teachers, give new privileges to drug addicts and
intrude on their freedom to practice or contribute to their
religions.
   ``Rarely has the legislative process been subjected to such a
campaign of misinformation and distortion,'' said Sen. George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas and acting GOP leader Alan
Simpson of Wyoming also criticized the campaign. Simpson said he
was concerned about erroneous claims that ``massive new rights''
would be created, while Dole said in a statement that there were
``serious misconceptions about what this bill does.''
   Jerry C. Nims, president of Moral Majority, said in a statement
after the vote that the override is likely to be ``the major
political issue for evangelicals in the 1988 elections.''
   ``If enough people are not voted into office to change what's
occurred, we will have entered the moral dark ages,'' Nims said.
   Dole, who was absent for the initial vote, was on the campaign
trail Tuesday for the GOP presidential nomination and did not vote
then either. On a radio call-in show in Milwaukee, Dole said he
would vote to override the veto if he were in Washington. But he
added, ``If it were the deciding vote, I would side with the
president.''
   Eight GOP senators who initially voted for the bill switched
Tuesday and supported Reagan. They were Simpson, Thad Cochran of
Mississippi, Paul Trible of Virginia, John Warner of Virginia,
Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Charles Grassley of Iowa, John
Danforth of Missouri and Christopher Bond of Missouri.
   In addition, two senators who didn't vote last time _ Sens.
Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and James McClure of Idaho _ sided with
the president.
   The Supreme Court ruling came in a challenge to federal
regulation mounted by tiny Grove City College in Pennsylvania. In
its attempts to reverse the decision, Congress became enmeshed in
controversies over abortion, religions and federal intrusion and
was unable to pass a corrective measure until this year.
   The restoration act says entire institutions and government
agencies must not discriminate if any program or activity within
them receives federal aid. Entire corporations are covered if they
provide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes to
the business as a whole, as in the Chrysler Corp. bailout.
   Farmers receiving crop subsidies, people using food stamps and
other individuals receiving federal assistance would not be subject
to regulation. An institution's refusal to perform or pay for
abortions would not be considered discrimination against women.
   The Supreme Court decision applied specifically to Title IX of
the 1972 Education Amendments barring sex discrimination in
federally funded education programs. It was interpreted also to
cover the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring racial discrimination in
federally assisted programs; the 1973 Rehabilitation Act barring
discrimination against the handicapped in any program or activity
receiving federal aid; and the 1975 Age Discrimination Act barring
employment discrimination against older people.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Bill Dominates Presidential Politics</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 6th graf pvs, bgng: Later, Dukakis, with 2 grafs to
UPDATE with Dukakis endorsements</NOTE>

   Democratic presidential contenders Paul Simon and Albert Gore
Jr. broke off campaigning Tuesday long enough to return to their
Senate desks and vote to override President Reagan's veto of a
civil rights bill. Republican contender Bob Dole stayed away and
straddled the issue.
   With Saturday's Michigan caucuses looming as the next campaign
test for the Democrats, Rep. Richard Gephardt attacked Michael
Dukakis for a ``battlefield conversion'' on trade issues so
important to the automotive industry. Dukakis aides retorted that
the Massachusetts governor has long been in favor of trade
legislation, just not Gephardt's proposal.
   Jesse Jackson was in Michigan, too, turning his anti-drug
crusade into a slap at the Reagan administration's Central American
policy. ``The No. 1 threat to your lives today is drugs,'' he told
a high school audience in Lansing. ``We're not threatened by 3
million Sandinistas and if so, can't be saved from them by 15,000
Contras.''
   Dukakis, at the Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston, did change
his stance on one issue, agreeing Tuesday to support a ban on
furloughs for first-degree murderers after public pressure stemming
from the release of a murderer who raped a Maryland woman.
   ``I try to listen, I try to learn,'' said Dukakis, who
previously had called the furlough program for murderers essential
for maintaining order in the state's prisons.
   Later, Dukakis made a trip to Connecticut to pick up
endorsements from Sen. Christopher Dodd and Gov. William O'Neill.
O'Neill predicted Dukakis would do ``extremely well'' in next
week's primary.
   Sources said Dukakis also would win the backing on Wednesday of
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, whose name crops up consistently in
speculation about a darkhorse emerging as the Democratic nominee in
a deadlocked convention.
   That would leave New York Gov. Mario Cuomo alone among the
prominent non-candidates who has yet to make an endorsement.
   An ABC News poll suggested a matchup between Dukakis and Vice
President George Bush in the general election could be a close
race. The network Tuesday night its nationwide poll of 1,007 people
gave Dukakis 48 percent and Bush 47 percent. The margin of error
was 3.5 percent, ABC said.
   Bush was in Washington during the day, and the only other GOP
hopeful, Pat Robertson, was cutting his staff to avoid exceeding a
federal spending limit. Aide Connie Snapp said the payroll has been
cut from a maximum of 230 to about 100, and another 30 or 40 aides
may be released later in the month.
   Reagan's veto of the civil rights bill and the
Democratic-controlled Congress' attempt to override dominated the
political news during the day. The Senate voted 75-24 to overturn
the president's veto, more than the two-thirds majority needed. The
House also voted to override, 292-133.
   Simon, who is hoping to win the Wisconsin primary on April 5,
said he sponsored the legislation in 1984 when it was first
introduced.
   ``This is something that ought to appeal to the basic good
instincts of every member of the Senate and the House,'' he said.
He said the issue involved is, ``Are we going to make real the
dream of equality in the Constitution?''
   Gore returned to Washington from Harrisburg, Pa., after
collecting endorsements from several legislative leaders. He also
met with Gov. Robert Casey, but came away without an endorsement.
   Gore used the civil rights bill to attack Bush, the prohibitive
front-runner for the Republican nomination. Gore said Bush, who
announced Monday that he supported Reagan's veto of the measure,
always sides with the president, ``even when the proposals are
unfathomably dumb.''
   ``When push comes to shove the vice president never disagrees
with President Reagan,'' he said, adding that Bush didn't disagree
with selling arms to Iran for hostages or in keeping Panama
strongman Manuel Noriega on the CIA payroll despite evidence of
drug involvement.
   Bush's top campaign spokesman, Pete Teeley, dismissed
suggestions that Bush would begin looking for an issue to disagree
with Reagan on, just to prove his independence.
   ``The fact is, six months ago everybody was writing that George
Bush had to disagree with the president in order to get the
nomination. Everyone now sees that that was a myth,'' the spokesman
said.
   Far, far behind in the Republican presidential race, Dole said
he stayed in Wisconsin rather than return for the Senate vote
because ``I wasn't needed.''
   He said he was personally opposed to the president's veto. But
asked on a Milwaukee radio station call-in program, he said, ``But
if it were the deciding vote, I would side with the president.''
   Dole, who was attacked by Bush earlier in the campaign for not
taking firm stands on issues such as arms control and tax
increases, placed a formal statement in the Senate record that did
not take a precise stand.
   In part it said, ``I have always supported legislation to
overturn Grove City to restore the broad civil rights coverage that
existed prior to that case. ... At the same time, I recognize that
(the bill) is not a perfect bill. I am not fully satisfied with
it... But the fact remains that the administration and its
congressional allies had the opportunity to offer amendments and
they were voted down.''
   Dole was absent when the bill passed the Senate originally in
January.
   The legislation stems from a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that says
an organization receiving federal aid must follow
anti-discrimination rules only for the program that receives the
aid, and not for the entire organization or institution. The
legislation would erase that distinction.
   Gephardt's repeated jabs at Dukakis centered on the trade issue
that is central to his own campaign. The Missouri congressman is
the sponsor of legislation calling for retaliation against unfair
trading practices. Dukakis opposes the Gephardt provision but
declared a few days ago that he favors a different proposal backed
by Sen. Don Riegle _ the Michigan senator who bestowed his
endorsement on Monday.
   ``We're getting some battlefield conversions,'' Gephardt said.

Observers</HEAD>

   Nicaragua told the Security Council
Tuesday the United States is plotting an invasion of that Central
American nation.
   Honduras, meanwhile, rejected Nicaragua's call for U.N.
observers to visit the Honduran-Nicaraguan border, where there was
fighting last week between soldiers of the leftist Sandinista
government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Nicaraguan envoy Rita Delia Casco, said of the alleged U.S. plot:
   ``The danger is not past. Indeed, it is growing. America plans
to provide a Central American Gulf of Tonkin incident to serve as a
pretext for direct invasion and escalation of intimidation and
threats.''
   The United States sent 3,200 soldiers to Honduras last week at
the request of the Honduran president, who accused Nicaraguan
soldiers of penetrating Honduran territory while chasing the
rebels. President Reagan said the U.S. move was to show support of
Honduras and as a warning to Nicaragua.
   Ms. Casco, director of the Foreign Ministry's department of
international organizations, said the situation ``points to the
possibility of imminent imperialist military action on a broad
scale.''
   The Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred when Washington said North
Vietnamese boats attacked two U.S. destroyers in that waterway on
Aug. 2, 1964. Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution five
days later and the United States began a military buildup in South
Vietnam that led to major American involvement in the Vietnam War.
   A four-member U.N. team was leaving Tuesday night to inspect the
Nicaraguan side of the border with Honduras.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani told reporters that Honduras
turned down a U.N. offer to send observers to that country.
   Honduran Ambassador Jorge Ramon Hernandez told the council a
U.N. team was not necessary because the five Central American
presidents, in a regional peace plan signed last August, had set up
an executive committee to verify compliance with the accord.
   Hernandez said Sandinista troops invaded Honduras and his nation
had the right to self-defense.
   ``Our military response has been limited so far and the
international assistance we are asking for basically has a
deterrent nature,'' he said.
   Honduran jets raided Nicaraguan positions last week in the Bocay
region, which straddles the border between the two countries. No
injuries were reported.
   On Sunday Honduran officials said the Nicaraguans were
withdrawing and the U.S. troops would leave the country soon. Maj.
Gary Hovatter, a U.S. military spokesman in Honduras, said Tuesday
that the American troops were conducting training exercises that
could last from 10 to 14 days.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the deputy permanent
representative at the U.N., told the council that Nicaragua had
launched a massive attack against the rebels, who have base camps
in Honduras.
   ``The Sandinistas committed aggression against Honduras,'' he
said. ``It was not the other way around.''
   Okun said the Sandinistas retreated into Nicaragua without
crushing the rebels because Honduras reacted forcefully and the
United States demonstrated its determination to help Honduras.
   He said stability will return to Central America only when
Nicaragua complies with the regional peace plan and gives up ``its
self-appointed right to subvert neighboring democracies and to
launch premeditated attacks.''

<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand, who said Tuesday he
will seek re-election next month, has managed in one seven-year
term to be both the least and most popular chief executive in the
30 years of the Fifth Republic.
   Mitterrand, 71, led the leftist surge in May 1981 that ousted
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and the center-right alliance
that had controlled the National Assembly for 23 years.
   The victory avenged Socialist Mitterrand's defeats in the
presidential elections of 1965 by Charles de Gaulle and 1974 by
Giscard d'Estaing.
   After five years, French voters turned against the Socialists in
the March 1986 parliamentary elections and returned control to the
right _ creating what became known in France as ``cohabitation''
between a Socialist president and a conservative premier.
   Socialist policies had dragged Mitterrand's popularity rating in
public opinion polls as low as 27 percent, but under the unwanted
marriage with the conservatives it soared again to a consistent 55
percent or more.
   The president pursued costly social programs after the
Socialists gained power, but then reversed course, instituting
austerity measures.
   Economic troubles brought his party to power, and caused its
downfall five years later. After the Socialist defeat, Mitterrand
eased into the role of elder statesman and held himself above the
day-to-day battles of governing, commenting on issues only
occasionally.
   He was born Oct. 26, 1916, in Jarnac in western France and
attended universities in Paris, earning degrees in law and letters.
He was drafted into the army in 1938, and shot and captured during
the German invasion in May 1940.
   Mitterrand escaped from a prison camp in Germany, returned to
France and created a Resistance network. His long feud with de
Gaulle began when Mitterrand refused to unite his Resistance group
with de Gaulle's.
   It was in the Resistance days that he met Danielle Gouze, and
they married in 1944, soon after France was liberated. He held
several government posts, including interior and justice minister,
during the chaotic postwar Fourth Republic.
   In the early 1970s he built the moribund Socialist Party into a
major political force, but the Union of the Left he formed with the
Communists fell apart in 1977.
   Not until the final days of the 1981 campaign did the two main
leftist parties join forces again to defeat Giscard and oust the
conservatives.
   Mitterrand shocked much of the West by bringing Communists into
his government, but the union lasted only three years. In 1984, the
Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.

   Dissident stockholders dropped their
opposition to Texaco Inc.'s financial reorganization plan Tuesday
as a federal judge opened a hearing on whether to implement the
proposal.
   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, announced that
96 percent of the shares voted, 174 million of 181 million, backed
the plan, which would allow the company to emerge from bankruptcy
court protection.
   After receiving the vote results, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge
Howard Schwartzberg heard comments on the plan, but no one opposed
it.
   Later, he recessed the hearing until Wednesday morning.
   Even though the plan received more than the two-thirds vote
needed from shareholders, the final decision on whether the plan
was fair and equitable rested with Schwartzberg.
   If Schwartzberg confirms the plan, Texaco could emerge from
bankruptcy protection by mid-April, which would be a year after it
sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code.
   Texaco was the biggest company ever to seek refuge in the
bankruptcy courts.
   Shortly before the hearing, Harvey Miller, the bankruptcy lawyer
representing Texaco, announced that attorneys for dissident
shareholders had dropped their opposition to the reorganization
plan.
   Those stockholders had objected to provisions that would free
officers and advisers of Texaco, Pennzoil Co., the former Getty Oil
Co., the Sarah Getty Trust and the J. Paul Getty Museum from all
liability arising out of the court fight that resulted from a
Texaco-Pennzoil battle over Getty Oil.
   Texaco said it was forced into bankruptcy court by a requirement
that it post a multibillion-dollar bond while appealing the $10.3
billion judgment held against it by Pennzoil.
   A Houston jury had awarded the judgment in November 1985 after
finding Texaco had interfered wrongly with Pennzoil's agreement to
acquire part of Getty Oil before Texaco bought Getty itself.
   In December, Pennzoil agreed to accept $3 billion in cash from
Texaco to drop the judgment. The settlement was the keystone of the
overall bankruptcy reorganization plan, which would require Texaco
to pay its other creditors an additional $2.5 billion.
   While some shareholders first opposed dropping liability for
executives in the Pennzoil matter, others were unhappy with
anti-takeover provisions of Texaco's charter and bylaws that they
argued entrenched management and lessened accountability.
   The leader of the latter group was takeover specialist Carl C.
Icahn, who controls 14.8 percent of Texaco's common stock, making
him the company's largest shareholder. Despite his opposition to
those provisions, however, he had said he would vote for the
reorganization plan.
   Icahn's involvement _ along with reported interest by fellow
takeover artist T. Boone Pickens and others _ made Texaco a prime
target for takeover speculation in recent weeks.
   The company cleared another obstacle on Friday when it announced
it had reached a framework for resolving a dispute with the
Internal Revenue Service.
   In January, the IRS said it was pursuing claims totaling as much
as $6.5 billion against Texaco. But Friday Texaco said it would put
into escrow $1 billion over the next four years while negotiating
the dispute after emerging from bankruptcy reorganization.

   Demonstrators protesting against the
state grand jury in the Tawana Brawley case met
counter-demonstrators for the first time on Tuesday, while at least
two protesters scuffled with police.
   There were no arrests.
   Roughly 100 marchers led by the Rev. Al Sharpton and Brawley
family lawyer C. Vernon Mason gathered outside chanting, ``Governor
Cuomo, haven't you heard? This is not Johannesburg.'' That group
was predominantly black.
   About 75 whites, who at first watched silently, began to shout
back. ``Get Tawana to testify. We care too,'' some of them said.
   There was no scuffling between the two groups.
   Miss Brawley, a black 16-year-old, claims she was kidnapped and
sexually assaulted by at least six white men during four days in
November. Mason and another attorney, Alton Maddox Jr., have
advised their client not to cooperate with investigators.
   Sharpton's group had promised to disrupt grand jury proceedings
in the case. About 50 people from New York City joined as many
local residents Tuesday morning for a march from the Mid-Hudson
Bridge.
   Later, members of Sharpton's group attempted to push through a
line of police who stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the doors
of a state armory, where the grand jury has been meeting. At least
two protesters struggled with police and were taken into a van, but
were released and allowed to return.
   ``If it comes necessary for arrests to be made, we'll make
them,'' Police Chief Stewart Bowles said. ``I'd rather not.''
   Despite temperatures which hovered near 30 degrees, Sharpton
said his group would stay all night or even several days until the
grand jury was disbanded. Some 15 to 20 protesters remained at the
scene at midevening.
   A spokesman for Attorney General Robert Abrams would not say if
the grand jury was meeting Tuesday, but there was no sign of grand
jury activity.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo selected Abrams to investigate and, if
necessary, prosecute the case.
   At one time, Sharpton, Maddox and Mason had insisted that Abrams
personally handle the case. They have since demanded a special
prosecutor, but Cuomo has refused.
   Maddox says Abrams has violated the law by disclosing certain
facts about the grand jury, such as the instructions it received,
its purpose for forming and its makup. He said state law requires
that grand jury proceedings be secret.

   The U.S. Navy is preparing
to shepherd its 40th convoy through the Persian Gulf war zone and
officers say alertness is as high as when the operation began eight
months ago.
   They said, however, that a permanent high level of alertness
takes a toll on the crew.
   ``The hardest part of the mission is that you have to stay ready
24 hours a day. There's no time, really, to let your guard down,''
said Cmdr. Paul Rinn, 40, of the Bronx, N.Y.
   He commands this missile frigate, one of 16 Navy ships serving
in the escort and patrol squadron called the Middle East Force.
   Rinn spoke with members of a Pentagon news media pool Tuesday on
the bridge of his ship, one of the Navy's newest Perry-class
frigates.
   Soon afterward, officers in the combat information center were
monitoring radio traffic about an Iranian attack on a commercial
vessel off Dubai, 90 miles away.
   Messages said the Greek-flagged tanker Stavros G.L. was attacked
at 2:45 p.m. approximately 30 miles north of Dubai and was on fire.
   The U.S. frigate Jack Williams, a sister ship to the Roberts,
went to the tanker's aid from about nine miles away. The Williams
rescued 14 crewmen in a lifeboat, according to Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van
Dyke, a Navy spokesman.
   When the fire was under control, the tanker's skipper asked that
the crew be returned to the ship, Van Dyke said.
   It was believed to be the third time a U.S. warship gave
``humanitarian assistance'' to a ship attacked by Iranian gunboats
in the gulf. The last was Christmas Day when the USS Elrod rescued
crewmen from a burning vessel in the southern gulf.
   Iran has attacked seven neutral ships in the gulf since Friday.
Iraq has raided a similar number of Iranian owned or chartered
tankers beginning earlier in March. Iraq and Iran have been at war
since September 1980.
   The Roberts, a 445-foot vessel launched two years ago, began its
latest mission after a three-day resupply stop and the first
liberty for the 209-man crew since arriving in the gulf nearly a
month ago.
   Soon after entering international waters Tuesday, Rinn ordered
the crew to general quarters to ``clear the mind'' after the port
call.
   They test-fired defensive gun systems as part of the effort to
renew vigilance.
   On its last mission in the northern gulf, the $400 million
warship had a series of ``close encounters'' with Iraqi aircraft,
the captain said.
   From 30 to 40 Iraqi air missions came near his ship en route to
attacks on Iranian vessels, Rinn said, including three Mirage F-1s
armed with Exocet missiles that flew wing-to-wing 50 feet above the
water.
   He said the jets came within five miles of the Roberts, heading
away and not demonstrating hostile intent.
   ``You can basically say we were a blink of an eye away from
anything that could happen,'' Rinn said.
   ``I'm never going to allow my ship to be shot at and hit,'' said
Rinn, adding the fate of another sister ship, the USS Stark, ``is
not lost on us.'' The Stark lost 37 of its crew when hit by an
Iraqi Exocet missile last May 17.

<TEXT>
   A Protestant gunman who
attacked a funeral for IRA guerrillas last week was charged Tuesday
with murder in the killings of six Roman Catholics, including three
who died in the cemetery onslaught.
   Michael Stone, 33, was taken to court under heavy guard and
police testimony said Stone told officers his ``military
operation'' was in retaliation for attacks by the outlawed Irish
Republican Army.
   Police quoted Stone as telling interrogators, ``I alone carried
out this military operation as a retaliatory strike against
Provisional Sinn Fein, the IRA, in response to the slaughter of
innocents at La Mon, Darkley, Brighton and Enniskillen,'' referring
to some IRA attacks in the last decade.
   He stood silently in the dock through the 10-minute hearing
while a police officer also testified that Stone told detectives:
``I would state I am a dedicated free-lance Loyalist (Protestant)
paramilitary. No surrender.''
   Stone was charged with killing three people March 16 at a
funeral in Milltown for three IRA members shot by British security
forces in Gibraltar. An alleged accomplice is being held by police.
He has not been identified.
   Stone also is accused of killing three other Catholics shot in
sniper attacks between November 1984 and May 1987. The victims were
a milkman, a bread delivery man and a carpenter, none with known
IRA links.
   An outlawed Protestant guerrilla group, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters, claimed responsibility for each of those murders.
   In Catholic west Belfast, where British authorities ordered a
``massive murder investigation'' after the killing of two British
soldiers during another IRA funeral on Saturday, police erected
road blocks at main roads into the ghetto.
   British soldiers, rifles in hand, patrolled the streets.
   Police sources say up to 30 suspects have been identified from
an army video and TV footage of Saturday's rampage.
   A funeral mob dragged the soldiers from their unmarked car,
stripped and beat them. They were shot out of sight of the cameras
in a soccer stadium.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher attacked Britain's
two television networks, the British Broadcasting Corp. and
Independent Television News, for refusing to give police their
unscreened film of the horrifying scenes. The networks said handing
over the film would endanger the lives of their crews.
   ``Either one is on the side of justice in this matter or on the
side of terrorism,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in the House of Commons as
her rank-and-file supporters clamored for the government to seek a
court order to force the networks to yield their film.
   Government sources said lawyers were considering legal moves.
   The two soldiers, whom the army has acknowledged should not have
been in the area, were attacked after they drove up to the funeral
cortege.
   Some of the tense crowd apparently suspected another Protestant
assault following the gun and grenade attack at Milltown Catholic
cemetery.
   In Milltown, Stone, still hurling hand grenades and firing until
his gun jammed, was captured by enraged mourners at the funeral and
beaten before police arrived.
   The guerrilla attacks Stone cited in his statement to police
dated back to Feb. 17, 1978, when bombers killed 11 people at a
restaurant outside Belfast.
   At Darkley, a village in County Armagh near the border with the
Irish Republic, gunmen fired on the congregation in a Protestant
chapel on Nov. 20, 1983, killing eight people.
   In the Brighton bombing on Oct. 12, 1984, the IRA blew up the
hotel where Mrs. Thatcher was staying during a Conservative Party
conference. She escaped injury, but five people were killed and 30
injured.
   At Enniskillen, in Northern Ireland's County Fermanagh, the IRA
bombed a service for war dead on November 8, killing 11 people.
   The victims were among at least 2,639 people killed in sectarian
violence in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland since 1969. The
IRA is fighting to end British rule and unite the province with the
Catholic Republic of Ireland under a lefist administration.
   In Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second-largest city, police
said several people were held for questioning about the murder on
Monday of a policeman at a checkpoint. The IRA has claimed
responsibility.
   Earlier Tuesday, police sealed off the main shopping precinct in
Londonderry after discovering a 25-pound homemade bomb. Police
detonated the device in a controlled explosion.

   Harold Thomas left his rotting, frigid shack
along the river in January for a new life with an elderly New
Mexico couple, but after three months he returned home Tuesday to
start over again.
   ``I just wasn't progressing,'' Thomas said as he was greeted by
a throng of reporters at a downtown bus station. ``They were
looking for a more experienced man.
   ``I thought I'd get some wages,'' he added. ``They treated me
very nice but no wages.''
   The couple paid Thomas room and board and deposited $300 for him
in a Portales bank about a month ago. On Monday, Thomas withdrew
the money and boarded a bus for Chicago. He said the money was put
into an account after media reports appeared indicating he wasn't
receiving a regular salary.
   Thomas hopped in a cab and headed for a girlfriend's apartment
where he said he would be staying.
   ``I don't have a job, not right off,'' he said. ``But I've got a
few ideas of my own. I'm going to be looking.''
   ``I'm sad that it turned out like it did because we really liked
the man,'' Ethel Gilman said Tuesday by phone from her home in
Portales, N.M. ``He was very pleasant and friendly. We tried to
treat him as good as we did our own family.''
   Thomas, 34, also said he was homesick after working at the
wrecking yard owned by Mrs. Gilman, 68, and her 75-year-old
husband, Roy. He said he hoped to find a new job and planned to
marry in Chicago.
   The Gilmans read about Thomas in an Associated Press story
describing his life in a shack along the Chicago River during
subzero temperatures. The couple offered him a job and a place to
stay.
   Thomas arrived Jan. 17 in Portales, an eastern New Mexico
farming and ranching community of about 11,000 people. He lived in
an 8-foot-by-30-foot trailer in the wrecking yard where he worked
tearing apart old cars and rebuilding engines.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Gilman blamed past news reports in part for why
the couple's relationship with Thomas didn't last. She was angry
that reports focused on Thomas being paid in room and board.
   She said people who read those stories had ``been calling us
from everywhere saying we've been trying to make a slave out of
Harold. All we did was try to help him.''
   Before leaving New Mexico, Thomas said he hoped his brother
would help him find a place to stay.
   Thomas and his brother, Myles, 35, were arrested Jan. 18, 1987,
on a Lake Michigan tour boat and later pleaded guilty to burglary.
They were sentenced to two years probation.
   Thomas had been living on the boat at the time as shelter from
the cold, said Kay O'Sullivan, the brothers' probation officer.
   Ms. O'Sullivan said Tuesday that she wasn't surprised he was
returning.
   ``I felt there probably wouldn't be many people he could be
friends with down there because there probably aren't many blacks
in Portales,'' Ms. O'Sullivan said. ``I just felt he didn't think
this through.''

   Thousands of Israelis mobbed Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir on his return from a U.S. visit Tuesday and cheered
him for his firm opposition to an American peace plan. In the
occupied lands, violence continued.
   The army said troops shot and killed a Palestinian man in a
clash Monday night, bringing the Arab death toll in 15 weeks of
protests in the occupied territories to 107, according to U.N.
figures. The Israeli army has suffered one fatality.
   At least three more protesters were wounded in clashes, and a
Palestinian who allegedly collaborated with Israeli authorities was
shot and killed by fellow Arabs, Palestinian reports said.
   An Israeli soldier was taken to a hospital after being hit in
the chest with a rock during a demonstration Tuesday in the Gaza
Strip refugee camp of Deir El Balah, an army spokesman said.
   Returning from a week-long visit that included talks with
President Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Shamir
said U.S. officials had set no deadlines for Israel to accept the
plan.
   ``No one demanded anything from us,'' he told reporters at Tel
Aviv's Ben Gurion airport. ``It all depends on us.''
   Shamir also hinted Shultz was considering a return to the Middle
East in another attempt to defuse Israeli-Palestinian tensions.
   Asher Naim, the information minister at the Israeli Embassy in
Washington, said Shultz will travel to the Middle East in two weeks
to continue negotiating for acceptance of his regional peace plan.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Tuesday that Shultz
had not yet decided to return.
   Naim also said Israel's Cabinet probably would vote to keep
alive the Shultz peace initiative when it debates the issue in two
weeks.
   Entering Jerusalem, Shamir's car was mobbed by thousands of
delighted supporters, who danced, sang and waved banners saying:
``Shamir remains strong.''
   ``These good wishes went with me wherever I went,'' Shamir told
the crowd, mostly members of his right-wing Likud bloc and Jewish
settlers. ``No one dared force on me decrees that lovers of the
land of Israel could not accept.''
   Shamir used harsh words to restate his objections to the Shultz
plan.
   ``These proposals, in our opinion, will not bring peace closer,
and the peace may even be harmed if (our) disagreements are not
taken into consideration,'' he said.
   Shamir has repeatedly objected to a major component of the U.S.
plan _ an international forum that would launch peace talks between
Israel and its Arab neighbors. He fears the forum would be hostile
to Israel and force concessions from territories occupied in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Shultz's plan also calls for three years of self-rule for the
1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with
talks on an overall settlement to begin in December.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who heads the centrist Labor
Party and has supported the Shultz plan, toured the Gaza Strip on
Tuesday and discussed granting autonomy to its 650,000 mostly
impoverished residents before implementing autonomy in the West
Bank.
   ``It would be a scandal and a mistake to just get up and leave
Gaza,'' Peres told reporters. ``But if we could reach an
arrangement of autonomy ... with Jordan which would enable us to
live on terms of security with Gaza, I'm for that.''
   The death toll rose as the body of a Palestinian was found in
the hills of Tubas, a West Bank village 50 miles north of Jerusalem.
   An army spokesman confirmed troops shot the man Monday night
when their patrol was attacked by protesters hurling rocks, metal
bars and bottles.
   In Gaza, the body of a Palestinian man was found in an orchard
in the village of Beit Hanoun, Israel radio said. The man's skull
had been crushed. A military spokesman denied army involvement in
the death, but villagers said the man was beaten to death by troops.
   A third Palestinian died when he was shot from a passing car in
southern Gaza by assailants assumed to be Arabs, the army said.
Palestinian journalists said the man, Naim Abu Lafyeh, was killed
for collaborating with authorities.
   Troops also shot and wounded a resident of Khan Younis refugee
camp when he attacked an officer with a metal pole, Israel radio
said. Officials at Ahli Arab hospital said they admitted two
Palestinians suffering injuries inflicted by troops.
   In the West Bank, members of two Arab councils resigned Tuesday
a day after an underground leaflet called for Israeli-appointed
municipal officials to leave their jobs, the Arab-owned Palestine
Press Service said.
   In another development, a ministry spokesman said Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a parliamentary committee he authorized
civilians to shoot at firebomb throwers if their lives were
endangered and shooting was the only way out.
   State-run radio said earlier that Israelis were allowed to shoot
if the assailant was not standing in a crowd.

   The volcano that killed about 23,000
people in a 1985 eruption showed signs of activity Tuesday, and
officials warned residents in the surrounding region, the Volcano
Institute of Manizales said.
   Officials at the institute sounded a preventive alarm, but said
it was not necessary to evacuate people living near the Nevado del
Ruiz volcano.
   The volcano erupted Nov. 13, 1985, melting glacial ice on its
slopes and sending an avalance of mud which buried the nearby town
of Armero.
   Institute spokesman Alvaro Acevedo said seismographs
``registered abnormal seismic activity and the expulsion of
abundant ashes'' from the mountain, about 65 miles west of Bogota.
   But Acevedo said the situation is similar to other periods of
volcanic activity the institute has registered since the 1985
catastrophe.
   The volcano erupted on July 29, 1986 after tremors. There were
no injuries.
   The institute lies about 25 miles from the volcano.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Capture Three Soviets; Another Missing in Ethiopia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eritrean separatists have taken three Soviet
soldiers prisoner in Ethiopia and a fourth is missing, the
government announced Tuesday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the four
were among 13 Soviet military advisers captured in Ethiopia last
week by forces fighting the leftist government to establish an
independent Eritrean state.
   Gerasimov told reporters at a news briefing that the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front recently ``has intensified combat
operations.''
   He said nine of the Soviets captured returned to their command
posts, three were identified by their captors as prisoners of war
and one remained missing.
   Ethiopia has strong political ties to the Soviet Union.
   Gerasimov had no details of the incident or the conditions in
which the Soviets are being held.
   Eritrea, a former Italian colony on the Red Sea, was
administered by Britain from World War II until 1952 when it was
federated with Ethiopia under a U.N. resolution. Ethiopia
incorporated it as a province in 1962, touching off a rebellion for
independence.
   Some Eritrean groups have signed an agreement to unite, but not
the Eritrean Popular Liberation Front, which is composed mainly of
urban-born Christians.
   According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies
Military Balance 1987-88 edition, there are an estimated 1,400
Soviet technicians and advisers in Ethiopia. An estimated 2,500
Cuban combat troops also are in Ethiopia supporting the Addis Ababa
government.

   Japanese patrol boats recovered the bodies of 11
crew members Wednesday after a Philippine cargo vessel capsized in
rough waters off the Pacific coast of northern Japan, officials
said.
   One crewman was rescued after the Tuesday night incident, and
patrol boats and helicopters were searching for 10 other seamen,
said Michiaki Katsumata, spokesman for the Maritime Safety Agency's
regional office in Shiogama, 190 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Katsumata said Feddrico Sandaga, 60, was picked up near the
6,812-ton Captain Trader, which ran aground in 20-foot water and
then capsized about two miles northeast of Shiogama in Miyagi
Prefecture.
   Katsumata said officials are still attempting to identify bodies
of the 11 victims and to establish the cause of the accident.
   The Captain Trader, owned by a shipping company in Manila, was
headed for Shiogama from Hakodate in Hokkaido island with 4,000
tons of pig iron when it ran aground, Katsumata said.

<HEAD>An Off-Broadway Revival of `Julius Caesar' with Al Pacino and
Martin Sheen</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   It's hard to imagine a more miscast version of
``Julius Caesar'' than the all-star revival currently ambushing
audiences at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater.
   Not since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton curdled Noel
Coward's ``Private Lives'' several seasons back has so much star
power been used to so little effect. In this case, the big guns
parading around in white and burgundy togas are Al Pacino, Martin
Sheen, Edward Herrmann and John McMartin.
   Each operates independently on stage, never connecting with the
other performers or the play. A variety of acting styles are adrift
in this endless, exhausting production that seems much longer than
its two hours and 30 minutes.
   This is a ``Julius Caesar'' that doesn't connect on any level _
not as political drama, personal tragedy or even historical
pageantry. Coming right after the Public's spirited and sensual
``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' it is a major disappointment.
   ``Julius Caesar'' is a transition play, bridging the historical
plays and the later great tragedies. The drama requires actors
comfortable in both settings. There are none in this production,
and director Stuart Vaughan is at a loss to impose any sort of
style or unity to the diverse proceedings.
   Pacino, as Mark Antony, gives the evening's most bewildering and
idiosyncratic performance. The actor has a magnetic physical
presence, and it's impossible not to watch him when he is on stage.
His Antony moves like a feral, street-wise gang leader who belongs
more in the Bronx than in ancient Rome. So does his accent.
   To compensate for his blue-collar patois, Pacino speaks in a
slow, deliberate cadence. He spits out each word carefully as if he
were afraid of mispronunciation. What's left is language devoid of
any feeling or emotion.
   Sheen, in the pivotal role of Brutus, has much the same problem
with the play's poetry. He gives an unshaded, monotone performance.
Sheen's Brutus also lacks the patrician bearing that should be the
hallmark of this play's most interesting character. He's a cipher
and that blandness dilutes the tragedy.
   As a result, interest shifts to another of the conspirators,
Cassius, played by the usually reliable Herrmann. A tall,
vulture-like villain, the actor starts out strongly, insinuating
his way into the good graces of Brutus. His explanation of why
Caesar should be killed is chillingly logical and effective. But
once the deed is accomplished, Herrmann falters. His performance
turns petulant, and Cassius becomes a scolding old maid furious
that things have turned out wrong.
   McMartin's Caesar is also problematic. Although he captures the
man's vanity, there's little here to suggest a charismatic leader.
He's laconic rather than a commanding figure whose popularity
threatens the empire.
   The supporting cast is equally unmemorable and all over the
forum in acting ability and accents, although Jerry Mayer has a
nice moment or two as a comic cobbler.
   Vaughan's direction collapses in the second act. Awkward
battlefield tableaux alternate with more intimate scenes that show
the unraveling of the assassins' lives. It's a toss-up as to which
scenes are more chaotic or unmoving. The deaths of Brutus and
Cassius seem to come more as a relief than as the inexorable result
of fate. The tragedy is nowhere to be found.
   The setting, designed by Bob Shaw, doesn't help the drama. The
playing area is all exposed brick _ as are the inevitable columns _
making the stage look like a Soho loft undergoing renovation.
   ``Julius Caesar'' is the second production in the Public
Theater's ambitious marathon to present all of Shakespeare's 36
plays over a six-year period. Next up is ``Romeo and Juliet,''
starring Peter MacNicol and Cynthia Nixon as the star-crossed
lovers. It begins performances April 19. Maybe it can get the
Public's Shakespeare celebration back on track.

<HEAD>Military Discontent With Noriega Said To Be Growing</HEAD>

   The United States has offered to fly
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega to exile as an
inducement to get him to leave that troubled country, U.S.
officials said Tuesday.
   The offer came last week when two State Department envoys met
with Noriega in Panama and encouraged him to step down, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Noriega has refused to accept any arrangement that involves his
departure from Panama, although the government of Spain has offered
him asylum.
   The two State Department envoys _ William G. Walker and Michael
Kozak _ told Noriega in their meeting that the U.S. proposal to fly
him into exile might be the ``last best offer'' he would receive
for ending the crisis in a way that ensured his personal safety,
one official said.
   The official said the offer would also allow Noriega's family
and friends to accompany him.
   Senior administration officials believe Noriega will be forced
from office shortly because of growing opposition to his rule in
the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   The officials, speaking only on condition they not be named,
said the anti-Noriega sentiment within the military has been
accelerating over the past week and is probably the most important
factor working against his survival as defense chief.
   They said Noriega's efforts to overcome the crisis probably were
not helped with his conditional offer Monday night to resign before
the May 1989 presidential elections.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Panamanians
regard the offer as a ``ploy to buy time,'' a view he said was
shared by the United States.
   ``The message from Panamanians is clear. For the good of Panama,
Noriega should leave,'' Redman said, referring to the hostile
reaction of Panamanian opposition leaders to the proposal and to
the continued virtual shutdown of the country because of a general
strike.
   ``His presence is the root cause of continued political and
economic instability,'' Redman said. ``The ongoing general strike
is only the most recent demonstration of the overwhelming
opposition from all segments of Panamanian society to Noriega's
continued rule.''
   President Reagan, arriving on Capitol Hill on Tuesday for talks
on his campaign to aid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, said ``We feel
Noriega should leave Panama'' when reporters asked him about the
situation in Panama.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said any proposal
that calls for Noriega's resignation as defense chief but does not
include his actual departure from Panama ``is like getting the fox
out of the hen house, then giving him quarters next door.''
   Fitzwater said Noriega's plan would allow him to remain in
control of the Defense Forces.
   Noriega's offer to resign, announced Monday night in a national
broadcast by civilian chief of state Manuel Solis Palma, was
conditioned on a dialogue with the opposition.
   Fissures in the Defense Forces were evident last Wednesday when
there was a coup attempt against Noriega. Even though the plot was
crushed, officials said, a number of officers knew about the
conspiracy but said nothing, rather than tip off Noriega.
   ``The coup attempt was the tip of the iceberg,'' one official
said.
   Discontent within the military ``is what everybody was looking
for,'' he said. And almost without warning, ``there it was.''
   This development is more significant than the wave of strike
activity in recent weeks and the country's acute cash shortage,
reflected in the government's inability to meet the public payroll,
according to the officials.
   Redman said the Defense Forces were weakened on Monday when a
series of promotions were announced. He said the promotions were
based on ``political, not professional, reasons.''
   Noriega was said to have been defiant last Friday during a
3{-hour meeting with two State Department envoys who encouraged him
to resolve the crisis by seeking political asylum in Spain or
another third country.
   Noriega told the envoys they had come under the influence of
Panamanian ``oligarchs'' opposed to him and that the Americans
``were dumb enough to believe them,'' one official said.
   The two officials _ Walker and Kozak _ appealed forcefully to
Noriega to step down but were rebuffed.
   They told Noriega that unless he resigns, the Panamanian Defense
Forces could fall into disrepute and suffer the same fate as the
Nicaraguan National Guard. This was a reference to the military
force which served under the Somoza family dynasty and was
dismantled by the Sandinista government after the 1979 revolution.
   Noriega also was told that the Reagan administration is eager to
see the Defense Forces survive and to continue its prescribed role
as guardian of national sovereignty.
   Walker and Kozak reportedly encouraged Noriega, who is under
indictment on drug smuggling charges in Florida, to accept an offer
by Spain under which he would be allowed to go to that country,
provided he asks for asylum and the United States does not seek his
extradition the drug charges.
   The United States says the legitimate government in Panama is
that of President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who tried to dismiss
Noriega on Feb. 25.
   But the Noriega-dominated National Assembly voted to oust
Delvalle and Palma was named new head of state. Noriega opponents
then called for a general strike in protest.

<HEAD>Soviet Chief Says It Absurd to Blame Moscow For Nicaragua Conflict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday it's absurd to
blame Moscow for Nicaraguan conflicts and the Soviet Union has no
military-political plans for Central America.
   ``We are not reckless adventurers,'' the Soviet leader said.
   Gorbachev also said his economic and social reforms have brought
an ``upsurge of ideological clashes'' in his own country that are
still going on.
   His remarks came as Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
conferred in Washington with Secretary of State George P. Shultz on
issues including the superpower dispute over Nicaragua.
   Shultz wants Moscow to stop military aid to Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government, while Shevardnadze voiced ``serious
concern'' about U.S. policies in Central America. The United States
backs Nicasraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway and State
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman accused the Soviets on
Monday of furnishing an unceasing supply of weapons to the
Sandinistas.
   Gorbachev, the general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party,
outlined the Soviet position on Central America at a Kremlin
meeting Tuesday with Uruguay's president, Julio Sanguinetti, the
official Tass news agency reported.
   Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying, ``We will never understand how
Nicaragua can threaten the United States and the Western hemisphere
in general; we will never accept the absurd claim that the `hand of
Moscow' is the cause of the conflict and an obstacle to resolving
it.''
   The Soviet leader said that ``the U.S.S.R. does not have any
military-political plans in respect to that region and this theme
has never even cropped up in our relations with the Nicaraguan
leadership,'' according to Tass.
   ``Why should we need this?'' Gorbachev said. ``To provoke the
United States or somebody else in Latin America? We are not
reckless adventurers.''
   Gorbachev said the Soviets never supplied arms to leftist rebels
in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   He made no specific mention of U.S. charges of arms deliveries
to the Nicaraguans.
   Gorbachev also referred in his conversation with Sanguinetti to
domestic affairs, saying the economic and social reforms he
introduced have brought ideological clashes.''
   He said that those disputes ``have not yet subsided because
people want to know fully why things that had come into being in
extraordinary, extreme circumstances were retained also in normal
conditions.''
   Tass did not specify what Gorbachev was referring to. He may
have been talking about the drive by some Armenians to annex the
predominantly Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been
part of neighboring Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Gorbachev said he expects the Shultz-Shevardnadze negotiations
will help set the agenda for his fourth summit meeting with
President Reagan, which both sides have said will take place in
Moscow in late spring or early summer.
   ``The talks ... will show if there is a real possibility to
prepare a treaty on strategic (long-range nuclear) offensive arms
in time for President Reagan's visit to Moscow, whether it will be
possible to reach agreement on questions of the Afghan and Middle
East settlement and on other pressing issues,'' Gorbachev was
quoted as saying.

   The jury in the Robert Chambers Jr. trial,
deliberating the so-called ``preppie murder'' case for a sixth day,
focused Tuesday on testimony regarding pinpoint hemorrhaging in
Jennifer Levin's eyelids.
   The jurors, after being rebuffed in their request for medical
testimony about the specific amount of time a person's neck must be
squeezed in order for the person's eyelids to hemorrhage, widened
the request to all testimony regarding the hemorrhaging.
   State Supreme Court Justice Howard E. Bell agreed to allow
reading of testimony by prosecution witness Dr. Maria Landy,
assistant New York city medical examiner, and defense witness Dr.
Ronald Kornbluth, the Los Angeles medical examiner.
   Near the end of the day, the jury asked for a repeat of specific
parts of Ms. Landy's testimony, and, as lawyers argued over the
request, the jury was dismissed for the day.
   Earlier Tuesday, shortly after the jury began its sixth day of
deliberation, the panel was called into the courtroom. A court
reporter read this statement, which was agreed upon by the
prosecutors and the defense:
   ``The amount of time needed to cause the pinpoint hemorrhaging
in the lower eyelid was less than or equal to the time needed to
cause her death. There was no testimony from the doctors who
testified in this case that specified a specific minimum or maximum
period of time that it took to cause the hemorrhages as opposed to
the time it took to cause her death.''
   Chambers, 21, is accused of second-degree murder in the
18-year-old woman's death on Aug. 26, 1986.
   The jury, which got the case Thursday, could also convict
Chambers of the lesser crimes of first- or second-degree
manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide.
   The prosecution maintains he used her blouse to strangle her.
Chambers said in a statement to police that he killed her
accidentally when she hurt him during a rough sexual encounter.
   Chambers said the death occurred nearly instantaneously when he
reached up and pulled Miss Levin off him, flipping her to the
ground.
   The kind of hemorrhage mentioned by the jury often results from
strangulation. Medical experts who testified at the trial disagreed
about how long the pressure had been maintained in Miss Levin's
case.

   Pablo Escobar Gaviria, sought as a top
man in the notorious Medellin drug cartel, escaped arrest after a
shootout early Tuesday between his heavily armed bodyguards and
soldiers, the army's 4th Brigade said.
   It reported that at least one man, not identified but thought to
be one of Escobar Gaviria's personal guards, was injured. The army
would not elaborate.
   At least 25 bodyguards were arrested after the clash and a
variety of firearms and documents were seized, the army communique
said. The haul also was said to include communications equipment,
13 vehicles and ammunition.
   The army said Escobar Gaviria's wife, Maria Victoria, and her
sister were arrested elsewhere in Medellin carrying ``several
documents of interest.''
   Escobar Gaviria was indicted in 1986 on federal drug charges in
the United States. Another federal drug indictment in Florida last
month named Escobar Gaviria, Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega and 14 others.
   In its communique, the army said that after Escobar Gaviria was
located, patrols from the 4th Brigade, backed up by helicopters,
surrounded the wanted man's luxurious country estate at 5:45 a.m.
Tuesday. The estate is on Medellin's outskirts, 180 miles northwest
of the capital, Bogota.
   But the army said troops tripped a sophisticated alarm system of
lights and sirens, allowing Escobar Gaviria to escape in the
shootout that ensued between soldiers and his bodyguards.
   The Medellin cartel is considered the main cocaine trafficking
organization in the world. U.S. authorities have charged the cartel
is responsible for up to 80 percent of all the cocaine that reaches
the United States.
   Colombia's Justice Ministry in January ordered the arrest of
Escobar Gaviria and others named as cartel leaders for extradition
to the United States, the army said. Among those sought are Jorge
Ochoa, Juan David and Gonzalo Rodriguez.
   Troops immediately spread out in the small communities near the
country residence, but Escobar Gaviria eluded detection, the army
said.

<TEXT>
   Legislators voted Tuesday to keep the
presidential system of federal government rather than switch to the
parliamentary structure with a prime minister. President Jose
Sarney called the action ``an important victory.''
   Sarney said the 344-212 vote by the lawmakers rewriting the
constitution was ``better for the country. Congress understood
that.''
   Later Tuesday, legislators approved a five-year term for
presidents, rejecting by 305-223 a proposal to set the term at four
years.
   The present presidential term is for six years, and Sarney was
installed in office in 1985.
   Sarney had opposed a change to the parliamentary system, saying
it would bring further economic and social chaos.
   Opponents argued that a parliamentary structure was an option
for the nation that emerged in 1985 from 21 years of military rule.
   ``Presidentialism doesn't exist and doesn't work anywhere but
the United States,'' said Sen. Affonso Arinos of the Liberal Front
Party. ``Military, authoritarian and dictatorial regimes emerged
mostly because of presidentialism in Brazil.''
   Leftist legislators opposed to Sarney backed the presidential
system. But they also demanded direct presidential elections this
year with Sarney stepping down in March 1989. Sarney said he would
leave office in 1990.
   ``We didn't want a queen of England, we want elections, direct
elections this year,'' said Rep. Jose Genoino of the leftist
Workers' Party.
   The lawmakers have been meeting since February 1986 to rewrite
the constitution.
   Sarney, 57, was elected vice president in a 1985 electoral
college election organized by the outgoing military regime. But
President-elect Tancredo Neves died before inauguration in March
1985 and Sarney took power as the nation's first civilian president
since a 1964 military coup.
   Brazilians have not voted directly for the presidency since 1960.

traffic accident near Lodi, Calif., the alliance announced Tuesday.
   Claas, 59, was the chief administrative officer of the alliance,
an international Baptist organization which has a membership of

development and disaster relief efforts in Third World nations.
   Claas was traveling in California to a series of fund-raising

northeast of San Francisco.
   He died later in the day. Two other people, the Rev. Mervyn
Betts, 74, and his wife Nora, 67, of San Francisco, also were
injured, sheriff's deputies said.
   Claas was a citizen of West Germany, where he had served in a

   Claas is survived by his wife, the formed Irmgard Saffran, of
McLean, Va., and three children: Regina, Gabriele Claas Gloeckner,

<HEAD>Judge Says Harvard Entitled To Possession Of Tennessee Williams
Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Tuesday that Harvard
University was entitled to papers of the late playwright Tennessee
Williams after Harvard attorneys promised that earnings from any
publication would benefit his sister.
   Williams, the author of plays including ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' and ``Cat On a Hot Tin Roof,'' died in 1983 at age 71.
   The hearing, one of the final steps in distribution of the
Williams estate, came after Harvard objected to a plan by Southeast
Bank in Miami, which holds the papers as executor of the estate, to
give the manuscripts ``in trust'' to Harvard.
   The trustees for the 78-year-old sister, Rose Williams, wanted
the papers given ``in trust'' so the actual manuscripts could be
sold if she needed additional money for medical and living expenses.
   She has been institutionalized for 53 years in Ossining, N.Y.,
having undergone a lobotomy to relieve an unstable mental
condition. Many of Williams' plays are said to reflect the special
tenderness and concern he felt for his sister and others who are
lonely or mentally disabled.
   The university held that it had the right to clear physical
possession of the documents and Monroe County Circuit Judge Helio
Gomez agreed, saying he found no limitation in Williams' will on
giving the papers to the school.
   Harvard Attorney Frank Connors assured Miss Williams' trustees
that if anything had commercial value, she would have the benefit.
   Attorney Jim Hendrick, who represents Miss Williams' trustees,
told the judge that contents of some of the papers ``may be
scandalous, and may make reference to persons still living.
   ``They may not be appropriate to make public at this time,''
Hendrick said.
   The papers, reportedly appraised at $175,000, include sealed
envelopes said to contain manuscripts such as the one that later
evolved into ``The Rose Tattoo,'' and the first draft of ``Sweet
Bird of Youth'' as well as written notes and notebooks of various
kinds, Hendrick said.
   They include various plays and manuscripts, including some that
have not been published, he said.
   The estate was valued in the millions and has been distributed
gradually since his death, but Hendrick declined to place a value
on the overall estate.
   Hendrick said the question about the papers was the last
contested portion of the will of which he was aware. He predicted
that legal procedures surrounding distribution of the estate should
be concluded in the next month.

   Nearly a year after Texaco Inc. filed for
bankruptcy protection, the nation's third-largest oil company faces
an uncertain future clouded by corporate raiders, tax bills and its
legal fight with Pennzoil Co.
   The final phase of Texaco's historic bankruptcy case was
expected to begin today in White Plains, with the opening of court
hearings that could lead to final approval of the company's
reorganization plan.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard Schwartzberg was expected to
announce the results of a shareholder vote on the plan, then hear
final arguments by interested parties. If Schwartzberg confirms the
plan, Texaco could emerge from bankruptcy protection by mid-April.
   Texaco filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors on
April 12. It was the biggest U.S. company ever to do so. Texaco
claimed it was forced into the move by a requirement that it post a
multibillion-dollar bond while appealing a $10.3 billion judgment
held against it by Pennzoil.

   President Reagan sought Tuesday to revive his
stalled effort to aid the Nicaraguan Contras and said congressional
Democrats will be to blame if the supply-starved rebels fade from
existence.
   In an hour-long meeting on Capitol Hill, Reagan appealed to
Republican House members to unite behind a new effort to push
through Congress some kind of help for the Contras, whose last U.S.
aid ran out Feb. 29.
   Rebel supporters said their chances of prevailing on the
divisive issue were improved by last week's incursion into Honduras
by troops of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, which was
making some moderates nervous about leaving the rebels without aid.

<TEXT>
   Because shows such as ``Dynasty'' must tiptoe
around sex talk, Aaron Spelling Productions has set its new ABC
show ``Heartbeat'' in a women's clinic, where it can be right out
in the open, couched in the glow of healthy openness.
   Oh, please, ``St. Elsewhere,'' come back!
   Tonight's two-hour premiere features difficult childbirths,
artificial insemination and numerous gynecological exams. To start
off, there's an emergency birth that requires forceps and incisions.
   Oh, honey, bring in the potato chips!
   Kate Mulgrew plays hapless, overworked Dr. Joanne Springsteen,
who founded the clinic with Dr. Eve Autry (Laura Johnson, who is
married to Harry Hamlin of ``L.A. Law''). Ben Masters plays Dr. Leo
Rosetti, a pediatrician and object of Joanne's lust.
   Ray Baker is psychologist Stan Gorshalk, who counsels the
hospital's patients in matters psycho-sexual. In tonight's episode,
he confides to another doctor that he and his wife haven't had sex
in nine weeks. And the cobbler's children have no shoes.
   The show wants to offer up-to-date health information, like
tonight's debate over mastectomy vs. lumpectomy in cases of breast
cancer. Women's fears are unlikely to be assuaged by Gorshalk's
argument that patient Wendy (Kathleen Wilhoite) should be
encouraged to face the fact that she very well might die. That
should have 'em flocking in for mammograms.
   Meanwhile, a couple who can't conceive are advised by the
leering ``fertility specialist'' (Darrell Larson) to go for
artificial insemination. After the procedure _ yes, we get to be
there _ the nurse practitioner (Gail Strickland) gently suggests
orgasm aids in successful implantation, and leaves the woman in a
darkened examination room alone.
   In between trying to hit the sheets with Leo, Joanne contends
with a friend who's pursuing a career and can't be bothered with an
``incompetent cervix,'' meaning the baby will be born prematurely
if she walks around too much. Joanne saves the day by borrowing a
newborn from the nursery to convince the expectant mom she should
stay in bed at least until the baby can be safely delivered after
the next commercial.
   Meanwhile, Eve confronts Wendy's sexist family doctor, who
thinks Wendy ought to have a radical mastectomy instead of a
lumpectomy. What good is a breast, anyway, says the doc? It's
``just a piece of fat.'' Huffs glamorous Eve in her spandex dress,
``So are some of your body parts. Would you like to chop them off
and replace them with silly putty?''
   Some bad taste seems unintentional. Dr. Cory Banks (Lynn
Whitfield) is in a crisis because her husband is off on a building
job in Mexico, causing her to remark, ``Sometimes I wish that whole
construction project would get swallowed up in an earthquake.''
   With any luck, ``Heartbeat'' will get swallowed up by bad
ratings.

Molly's mom reassures in voiceover at the beginning of the episode,

furniture of life.''
   In the first new show, ``Here's Why You Shouldn't Get Too

cluttered bookstore for a befuddled but engaging bookworm, Moss
Goodman (David Strathairn).
   And her friend Nina (Maureen Anderman) is burglarized. ``Do you

underwear hanging out of the drawers?'' rages Nina. ``Yes,'' says
Molly, ``but I'm a bad example.''
   Enter Molly's new love interest, Detective Nathaniel Hawthorne
(Richard Lawson). Replies Nina upon being introduced to him,
``Hello. I'm policewoman Elizabeth Barrett Browning.''

   Is the United States headed downhill, spending
and taxing away its might and power?
   The thesis has arisen again, popularized by, among other events,
an academic's best-selling book describing the rise to dominance
and eventual deterioration of mighty nations through the ages.
   Several factors fit into the notion that assigns the latter role
to the United States, including budget imbalances, big defense
budgets, trade difficulties, slow growth and onerous taxes.
   Hastening the demise, according to neat but perhaps not correct
analyses, is the Kontradief Theory, named for a Russian economist
who many years ago claimed to have found a 50-year cycle of
economic rise and fall.
   As viewed by the most gloomy of forecasters, the U.S. economy
and much of the world's economy has entered a decline phase.
   The gloomy prospect seemed to fit a Paul Erdman scenario,
judging at least by the covers of his books. He is, you might know,
author of ``The Crash of '79,'' ``The Last Days of America'' and
``The Panic of '89.''
   He laughed. No way, said the economist-author. While the country
has troubles, he said, it is in the process of renewing itself,
with lots of 30-year-olds with new ideas and energy now entering
positions of power.
   ``Forget it,'' he said of the decline thesis. ``We've got the
resources. We're dynamic. And we've got an infusion of the best of
other countries through immigration.''
   Why, he asked, should we listen to ``a dead Russian economist
who made his observations before airplanes flew and before the
development of service economies?''
   But oddly, in the midst of one of the longest economic
expansions ever, the notion of a dynamic America is sometimes lost,
buried under concern for the worst aggregation of economic problems
since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
   But dynamic America exists in the concepts of many scholars,
among them David Birch, who won a wide following for his research
on small business while teaching at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   Small business, says Birch, represents renewal. It has become
the ``big picture in America.''
   Such businesses are innovating, exporting and creating jobs, he
reminded a meeting of National Small Business United, an
organization of independent business people that had it origins
during the 1930s.
   Turbulence in the business community often gains attention, with
takeovers and demises and problems at well-known companies. But
underlying the surface turbulence, Birch suggests, is a strata of
economic stability and growth.
   ``We turn over about 8 to 10 percent of our corporations and
about 8 to 10 percent of our jobs in this country every year,''
said Birch, founder and president of Cognetics Inc., an economic
research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
   It means, he continued, that ``we turn over half of the American
economy every five years _ half of all the companies and half of
all the jobs change every five years.''
   New business, he pointed out, find niches, create products and
eventually compete and force larger companies to innovate or die.
   After tracking about 12 million businesses for close to two
decades, ``what we began to realize was that there was this huge
changing of the guard taking place,'' he said.
   ``The dinosaurs were dropping like rocks, and a whole bunch of
little manufacturing companies were taking their place,'' he added.
   The turbulence that accompanies the process is economic decay
and a waning of power to some viewers. To others, it is seen as
renewal.

<HEAD>Argentines May Dislike the English but They Love Their Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUILMES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentines may have fallen out with
the English over the Falkland Islands, but the upper-crust still
likes the way they talk.
   That is evident on the quaintly British campus of St. George's
College in Quilmes where Argentine children are still being sent to
learn English with the proper accent and prepare to go on to
Cambridge or Oxford.
   For as much as $7,800 a year in tuition, the 330 boys and girls
who attend the only British-style boarding school in Argentina are
assured as fine an education as if they lived in England, said
headmaster Graham Sims.
   Ninety instructors from Britain teach children aged 3 through 18
the fundamentals as well as computer programming, chemistry,
advanced mathematics and English literature.
   English at St. George's is the most common classroom language,
although Argentina's Education Ministry requires that bilingual
schools teach some courses in Spanish.
   The school operates on British discipline.
   ``We are very strict and that means the boys and girls are not
allowed any physical contact in school. Holding hands is out,''
Sims said in an interview. ``We've all got to lead disciplined
lives. If not we become pretty hopeless human beings.''
   St. George's is in Quilmes, a city of 100,000 people 12 miles
south of Buenos Aires. Once a popular residential area for the
British who earlier this century built most of Argentina's
railways, it is most noted now for a brewery and the school.
   Dotting the 62-acre campus are a chapel, rugby fields, gardens,
two swimming pools, a horse-riding academy and dormitories where
students are required to place their folded clothes and towels on
racks in the bathrooms.
   The only inkling this is not Britain is when schoolchildren
break into Spanish after class or when Argentina's flag is raised
each morning outside the administration building.
   ``It really is a little piece of Britain in Argentina,'' said
Ray McKay, counselor at the Lincoln School in northern Buenos
Aires, the only American school in Argentina. ``The student body is
almost all Argentines from wealthy families who want their kids to
speak English.''
   Lincoln has 550 students, most of them children of U.S. Embassy
personnel, diplomats and businessmen in Argentina. Its schedule
follows the U.S. system, with summer vacation from June through
August. The English-style and Argentine schools have their vacation
from January to March, the Southern Hemisphere summer.
   St. George's, founded in 1898, is considered one of the four top
schools in Argentina for learning English.
   ``We offer a 24-hour-a-day education experience,'' said Peter
Stoyle, director of studies at St. George's. Wakeup calls are at
6:30 a.m. and lights are out across campus by 10 p.m., which is the
normal dining hour in Argentina.
   Student Magdalena Winter, 15, hopes someday to become a diplomat.
   ``Most people here believe we're getting a very good education
so we learn to put up with things that maybe we don't always
like,'' she said.
   Three other top British-style schools, St. Andrew's, St.
Catherine's and Northlands, are in the northern suburbs of Buenos
Aires, but they do not offer boarding.
   St. Andrew's is observing the 150th anniversary of its founding
by Scottish settlers. With 1,900 students, St. Andrew's is the
largest of the British-tradition schools and oldest of the
bilingual schools in Argentina.
   One of its headmasters, Watson Hutton, was credited with
introducing soccer to Argentina at the turn of the century.
   ``Without him there'd be no (Diego) Maradona,'' said headmaster
Kevan Prior, referring to the star of Argentina's 1986 World Cup
champions.
   St. Andrew's has been coed since 1980.
   ``We have a particular ethos, particular spirit, something the
parents of Argentine upper middle-class children choose,'' Prior
said.
   Tuition is $1,600 to $2,400 a year.
   Northlands School near St. Andrew's is considered the top girls
school in Argentina. Headmistress Jehane Taylor takes pains to
separate her school from anything British.
   ``This is an Argentine school with no funds from England that
happens to teach English,'' she said.
   Sensitivities over anything British comes from problems
regarding the Britain's Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, off
Argentina. The Argentines have claimed them since 1833 and here
they are called the Malvinas. Argentina invaded the Falklands in
April 1982 and were driven off by British forces three months later.
   ``During the Falklands these British-style schools got lots of
phone treats, some of them obscene,'' said McKay of the American
school. ``Some kids were pulled out by their parents and there were
some classroom tiffs over the so-called imperialist British.
   ``So it's really kind of remarkable now that so many Argentines
send their kids to these schools. I suppose it's kind of the snob
thing to do.''
   St. Catherine's School for girls, like St. George's, offers the
international baccalaurete program for its 1,100 students. The
program allows students to enter colleges in the United States at a
second-year level or qualify for advanced study in England.
   A St. Catherine's coordinator, Marie Philpotts, described the
school as ``British to a certain extent.'' Tuition ranges from
$1,050 to $1,600 a year compared to $1,000 to $2,000 a year at
Nortlands.
   Mrs. Taylor, head of Northlands, said the tradition of
Argentines sending their children to English-style schools goes
back several generations.
   The school, founded by a British governess in 1920, gives 985
students ``an Anglo-Saxon point of view and a Latin point of
view,'' giving students ``different ways of looking at knowledge,''
Mrs. Taylor said.

<HEAD>Ouster Of Baptist Liaison With Jews Opens Old Wound</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto NY90</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ouster by Southern Baptist officials of a
scholar for contending that God upholds his compact with Judaism
opens an old wound in Christian-Jewish relations.
   It also pointed to a lingering, but increasingly repudiated,
attitude in some church quarters.
   Historical church theories that God revoked his commitment to
Jews, replacing it with a pact with Christianity, figured for
centuries in anti-Jewish prejudice and persecution.
   However, many Protestant and Roman Catholic scholars have
rejected that notion, as have some denominations.
   ``If God's covenant has been broken with the Jews, it's
reasonable that other covenantal relationships might also be
broken,'' says the Rev. George J. Sheridan, who was removed from
his post.
   ``Therefore, we in the church would be an endangered species.''
   However, Sheridan contends that God doesn't go back on his
promises, either to the mother religion, Judaism, or to the
offspring of it, Christianity, and he cites Romans 11:
   ``Remember, it is not you (Christians) that support the root,
but the root that supports you ... and so all Israel will be saved
... For the gifts and call of God are irrevocable.''
   Sheridan, 46, of Union City, N.J., was dismissed after 13 years
of working with Jews as regional director of the interfaith witness
department of the Southern Baptist Home Mission Board.
   ``My point is that the covenant with the Jews was not
abrogated,'' he said in an interview, maintaining that they are
saved through God's mercy, just as are Christians, but without
accepting Jesus.
   Christians, unlike Jews, needed Jesus to draw them to the one,
same God, Sheridan said.
   A letter notified him he was relieved from his assignment Jan.
31 because of his ``theological position relative to evangelizing
the Jewish people'' _ something he opposed as unnecessary.
   It also offends Jews, implying their faith is useless.
   Sheridan's ouster ``strikes me like the Middle Ages,'' commented
Rabbi Leon Klenicki, director of the interfaith department of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   In Atlanta, the mission board's president, the Rev. Larry Lewis,
said Sheridan's view wasn't acceptable. The board lately came under
fundamentalist sway, as have most of the 14.6-million-member
denomination's agencies.
   Lewis said, ``The Bible teaches there is no other way to
salvation except through a personal faith in Jesus Christ.''
   Sheridan, with degrees from Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky., and Princeton Theological Seminary in
Princeton, N.J., linked his ouster to the heresy of Marcionism.
   ``That's what this thing borders on,'' he said. ``The Marcion
heresy was that the God in Jewish Scripture (the Old Testament) is
different than the God of the gospels (New Testament).''
   Marcion, a second-century preacher whose views were condemned by
the church, rejected the Old Testament, which historic Christianity
accepts along with the New Testament.
   ``I believe in Jesus Christ,'' Sheridan said, ``that Jesus
Christ is God, but for me to believe that the God of Jesus Christ
is not the God of Jews rooted in their Scripture is the heresy of
two different gods.''
   Sheridan said that after a tense meeting with officials last
year, he wrote a letter at their request outlining his views, and
his dismissal followed. In it, he said in part:
   ``The Scriptures provide a chronicle of how God has taken the
initiative in concrete historical ways to save God's people...
   ``In the Bible the term `savior' properly is ascribed to
God...In the Christian gospel, God comes to the world in the person
of a man, Jesus...In the New Testament, the title `savior' is
applied sometimes to God and sometimes to Jesus Christ,''
emphasizing that he bears ``the authority of God.''
   ``This established that Jesus Christ is the revelation of God
who, as the Hebrew Scriptures teach, is the one and only `savior'
of the people of God. To distinguish between the God revealed in
the Hebrew Scriptures and the God revealed in Jesus Christ is, for
Christians, a heresy...
   ``God saves his people, the entire Bible asserts. This salvation
is not brought brought about by the goodness of the people, but by
the merciful initiative of God. Jesus Christ provides the way for
the nations to be engrafted into the people of God...
   ``I find in the entire Christian Bible no hint that God cancels
out lovingkindness freely dispensed or promised. In fact, we find
the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.
   ``For this biblical reason...I believe that the Jews of today,
as ever, receive salvation through their having been chosen by God
in covenant with Abraham, Moses and the prophets.
   ``The election of the church is prefigured in this election of
Israel, and if the election of one is subjection to cancellation,
so, too, is the election of the other.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Vice Versa''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   How do you figure it _ three movies in a row with the same basic
plot? Last year it was Dudley Moore and Kirk Cameron changing
brains in ``Like Father, Like Son.'' Now we have Judge Reinhold
pulling a switch with his young son, Fred Savage, in ``Vice
Versa.'' Soon to come: George Burns trading identities with his
college-age grandson, Charlie Schlatter, in ``18 Again.''
   Such coincidence is unfortunate, since all three movies possess
the capacity to entertain.
   ``Vice Versa,'' in fact, is a nifty comedy of the supernatural
variety. It benefits from a clever script by Dick Clement and Ian
LaFrenais (who also produced), lively direction by Brian Gilbert
and the inspired teaming of Reinhold and young Savage as the
misplaced father and son.
   The role reversal is caused by a golden skull stolen from a Thai
temple. In ``Like Father, Like Son,'' it was a laboratory potion;
in ``18 Again,'' an auto crash.
   Reinhold is a Chicago department store executive who is a less
than adequate part-time parent. His 11-year-old son lives most of
the time with his mother who is now remarried. During a brief
visit, father and son touch the skull and become transformed.
   The fun begins, though both victims are distressed by their new
identities. Reinhold is more interested in rock music and his pet
frog, but he reports to the office and tries to fake his way
through matters that are as foreign to him as trigonometry.
   Savage attends school, but he is bored by the childish doings
and finishes his tests in a few minutes. He withers the school
bullies and barks orders to his limo driver. He devises a radio
transmitter so he can guide Reinhold through an all-important sales
meeting with the store chief (William Prince).
   Much of the hilarity is played off Reinhold's attempts to resist
the advances of his sexy date, Corinne Bohrer, and to explain his
bizarre behavior to his secretary, Gloria Gifford.
   Reinhold (``Beverly Hills Cop''), with his loony face and
rubbery body, is perfect for this kind of tomfoolery. Matching him
all the way is Fred Savage (``The Princess Bride''), who draws big
laughs by mouthing his adult dialogue. Director Gilbert and the
writer-producers have devised a genuinely sweet-natured movie, with
only a few swear words by Savage to warrant the PG rating.
   From Columbia Pictures. Running time: 98 minutes.

   When Richard Lester (``A Hard Day's Night,''
``Superman II'') came out with ``Petulia'' in 1968, it quickly
became a cult favorite with its quirky portrayal of life and love
among the rich at the end of a turbulent decade.
   The critically acclaimed Warner Bros. movie starring Julie
Christie and George C. Scott is among the videocassette releases
for March from Warner Home Video.
   Also highlighting the video debuts this month for home viewing:
the Jane Fonda-Jason Robards-Dean Jones 1966 romantic comedy, ``Any
Wednesday'' ($59.95, VHS@Beta, no rating), which has made the
rounds on commercial TV sliced and diced; ``Innerspace,'' the 1987
Steven Spielberg sci-fi presentation starring Dennis Quaid and
Martin Short; the Sally Field and Michael Caine comedy,
``Surrender'' ($89.95, VHS@Beta, Rated PG).
   Just in time for the Easter holiday are three movie classics
with religious themes: 1959's ``The Nun's Story'' ($59.95,
VHS@Beta, no rating), starring Audrey Hepburn; 1952's ``The Miracle
of Our Lady of Fatima'' ($59.95, VHS@Beta, no rating), starring
Frank Silvera and Angela Clark; and 1979's ``Jesus'' ($59.95,
VHS@Beta, Rated G), starring British stage actor Brian Deacon in
the title role. A Spanish-dubbed VHS only version is available of
``Jesus'' for $59.95.
   Reviewed this week are ``Innerspace'' and ``Petulia.''

<TEXT>
   ``Innerspace'' ($89.95, VHS@Beta, Rated PG)
   
   ``Innerspace'' is last summer's fantasy adventure offering from
the Steven Spielberg factory. Its one claim to distinction is the
spirited comic presence of Martin Short.
   The movie, directed by Joe Dante, takes off from the notion _
first explored in ``The Fantastic Voyage'' 20 years ago _ that a
man can be ``miniaturized'' and injected into the bloodstream of
another.
   In this case, the shrinking man is a daring but drunken test
pilot played by Dennis Quaid and the unwitting recipient is a
Walter Mitty-like supermarket clerk played by Short.
   The overly complicated plot involves rival scientists and enemy
agents trying to steal the computer chips that make the
``miniaturization'' possible. Since Quaid's air supply is limited,
Short _ aided by a newspaper reporter played by Meg Ryan _ must
race the clock to retrieve one of the chips needed for
``re-enlargement.''
   Some of the hijinks are clever, but the frenzied car chases grow
tiresome. The special effects are good but occasionally graphic,
especially one scene in which a villain is dissolved in a pit of
gastric acid.
   Short makes a believable and likable character out of Jack
Putter, who starts the movie on the brink of a nervous breakdown
but ends up a self-assured hero. Quaid and Miss Ryan have less to
work with, and several other capable actors are more or less wasted
in minor parts, including Kevin McCarthy, Fiona Lewis and Henry
Gibson.
   ``Innerspace'' is harmless enough for helping kids 8 and over
while away a rainy afternoon. Adults, however, may grow weary
before the caper has run its course.

   ``Petulia'' ($59.95, VHS@Beta, Rated R)
   
   What is Dr. Archie Bollen doing in a high-tech motel with the
rich, lovely and utterly weird Petulia? Darned if he knows.
   ``We're about to become lovers,'' she informs him as he tries to
unhook the feathery jacket to her sparkling gown. They don't. Not
then, anyway.
   The scene in the first 30 minutes of Richard Lester's
``Petulia'' introduces us to the title character played by Julie
Christie who has just picked up the recently divorced Bollen
(George C. Scott) at a San Francisco charity ball while her husband
(Richard Chamberlain) looks on.
   Bollen declares Petulia a ``kook,'' but she haunts him in more
ways than one, ultimately showing up at his apartment with a stolen
tuba and broken ribs and crawling into his life. But even Bollen's
love can't save Petulia from herself and a violent marriage.
   Using flashbacks and flashforwards, Lester and cinematographer
Nicolas Roeg, present a stark, sometimes funny, sometimes
frightening portrait of love among the spoiled rich during the
turbulent end of the 1960s. On the small, home screen in the 1980s,
the movie holds up just fine with some richly textured images and
closeups that show a beautiful Christie, a young Chamberlain as
remembered from TV's ``Dr. Kildare'' days and a somewhat sexy Scott.
   There are also a few cameo surprises, such as Janis Joplin with
Big Brother and the Holding Company entertaining at the benefit.
Music by the Grateful Dead also permeates the flick.
   ``Petulia,'' with its love triangle and battered wife themes
easily plays today, and like ``The Graduate'' gives a savage
portrait of a time not forgotten.
   Joseph Cotten, Arthur Hill, Shirley Knight, Kathleen Widdoes and
Pippa Scott fill out the cast.

   ``Savage'' (RCA) _ Eurythmics
   
   On ``Savage,'' the Eurythmics are misanthropic, caustic and a
bit paranoid. They're strong on attitude but weak on delivery.
   The record emphasizes a big beat, mostly via programmed drums
and bass lines that make for mechanical music. Worst is the opening
cut, ``Beethoven (I Love to Listen to).'' Add singer Annie Lennox's
dry delivery, and the resulting sounds have both the pulse and
personality of a locomotive.
   Lost in the thundering shuffle are the lyrics by Lennox and Dave
Stewart, which positively snarl on paper. Lennox spends much of the
record telling us that love is cheap and men merit no respect.
``Love is a temple, love is a shrine, buy some love at the five and
dime,'' she sings on the best song, ``You Have Placed a Chill In My
Heart.''
   Oddly, Lennox and Stewart ease up on the syncopation on the last
two cuts of the record, which closes with the upbeat ``Brand New
Day.'' After 11 songs filled with cynicism, it's hard to believe
the optimistic message is sincere. But maybe it presages more
subtlety and finesse on their next record.

   ``Live _ The Road'' (MCA) _ The Kinks
   
   It's bad news when the best thing on an album titled ``Live _
The Road'' is a studio cut. But that's the case with the Kinks'
latest record.
   It opens with a new composition, Ray Davies' engaging,
autobiographical ``The Road.'' ``There's gas in my tank, and I've
still got a ways to go,'' the veteran rocker sings. On the rest of
the album, recorded in concert last summer, the Kinks play with the
verve of a driver intent on getting good mileage.
   There are stirring moments in the 50 minutes of music: ``Come
Dancing,'' sparked by Dave Davies' fluid guitar work; the
provocative ``Art Lover,'' which only Ray Davies could have
written; and the rocking ``Destroyer'' and ``Around the Dial.''
   But ``It,'' the album's other new song, and ``Cliches of the
World'' are too long and too ambitious. The other performances are
routine, with riffs and tempos that belong in a heavy metal cutout
bin.
   ``Live _ The Road'' is not a bad set, and the Kinks deserve
credit for reprising some of their lesser-known material from the
1980s (at one point they tease the audience with a false start of
``Lola''). But from such a well-respected band, it's a
disappointment.

<HEAD>Star Watch: George Burns _ Forever Young</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Burns paced the darkened backstage
of the Caesars Palace showroom, hummed softly and flicked ashes
from his ever-present cigar.
   ``I'm just making sure I can still walk,'' he dead-panned to a
couple sitting in the wings.
   Moments later, as the orchestra struck up ``Ain't Misbehavin',''
Burns sauntered on stage to a standing ovation, a rarity for the
opening of a Las Vegas show. He would receive two more before
exiting an hour later _ a sign of the respect audiences hold for
this man who was a vaudeville star in their grandparents' time.
   At 92, Burns shows no signs of slowing down. He's a regular at
the Palace on the Las Vegas Strip and at other Caesars properties
in Lake Tahoe, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J. His pace would
satisfy, and slow, most performers half his age.
   However, Burns has just completed a new movie, ``18 Again,''
which opens April 9. And he's working on a new book about the one
true love of his life, Gracie Allen, his stage partner, confidante,
best friend and wife for 38 years until her death in 1964. The
book, ``Gracie: A Love Story,'' is due out in October.
   Irving Fein, Burns' longtime friend and manager for 14 years,
says the book will be ``a loving, warm story about Gracie Allen
that has never before been told.
   ``George will always have this special love for Gracie,'' Fein
said during Burns' recent appearance here. ``He goes to her grave
(in Los Angeles) once a month. He talks to her, tells her
everything he's doing. He'll say `I just got back from Vegas. We
did great.' Or `I just finished a movie. It's about me and my
grandson and how we switch places.'
   ``He'll spend a lot of time just standing there talking to her,
letting her know what's happening in his life. She's still a very
special part of his life.''
   Burns gives his long-time mate the credit for his success.
   ``If it wasn't for Gracie, I wouldn't be here,'' he said,
puffing on a cigar in his dressing room before a recent Caesars
show. He crossed the room to a bar, poured a cup of coffee, then
settled in a chair next to the piano.
   Morty Jacobs, his pianist of 18 years, began picking out tunes
Burns sang as a teen-ager three-quarters of a century ago.
   ``What key is that?'' Burns inquired of Jacobs. ``Take it half a
tone lower.''
   ``We'll do some lovin', then you'll ask for more,'' Burns sang,
tapping shiny patent leather shoes on the dressing room floor.
   Onstage, opening act Susan Anton was belting out a raucous
version of ``Old Time Rock and Roll,'' a signal for Burns to exit
his dressing room. He walked briskly back and forth in the darkened
area, stopping to talk to workers or softly humming some of the
songs he would sing.
   Miss Anton dedicated her final song, ``Forever Young,'' to
Burns. He took a long drag on his cigar, then entered to the
standing ovation.
   ``In 1981 I played God,'' he said, referring to the first of
three movies in which he played the deity. ``I was a nervous wreck.
We're both the same age, but we grew up in different neighborhoods.
   ``Why shouldn't I play God? Anything I do at my age is a miracle.
   ``I've written six books. That's pretty good for a guy who only
read two.''
   His formula for acting?
   ``If the director wants me to cry, I think of my sex life.
   ``If the director wants me to laugh, I think of my sex life.''
   About that sex life?
   ``I'd go out with women my age, but there are no women my age.''
   Another put-down: ``There isn't anything I can't do now that I
couldn't do when I was 18 _ which shows you how pathetic I was at
18.''
   Burns smokes 15 to 20 cigars and drinks several martinis a day.
   What do his doctors think of that?
   ``They're all dead.''
   Burns began in show business at the age of 8, quitting school to
form a group of child singers known as the Peewee Quartet. Born
Nathan Birnbaum to a poor family on New York's Lower East Side, he
had only to look to his 11 brothers and sisters for his own
ensemble.
   He bounced around the vaudeville circuit until he was 27. ``Then
people discovered I had a talent _ a big talent. I was married to
her for 38 years.
   ``Gracie didn't tell a joke, she explained it,'' Burns recalled
of nearly four decades as straight man for the zany comedian.
   Burns admits he was devastated _ personally and professionally _
by Miss Allen's death in 1964. A decade later, in August 1974,
Burns underwent a triple heart bypass. At age 78, he was the oldest
bypass patient in history at that time.
   Four months after his surgery, Burns' longtime friend, Jack
Benny died. Benny had been scheduled to star in the movie ``The
Sunshine Boys.'' Burns was tabbed to take his place, won an Academy
Award for best supporting actor, and was on his way to his second
time around.

<HEAD>The Artists: Beauty Lies in the Suffering of Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Chul-soo draws stark pictures of
exhausted factory workers and peasants clawing the earth with their
hands because he sees beauty in their suffering.
   ``Beauty lies in the ordinary lives and suffering of the common
people,'' the artist says with a shy smile.
   Lee is a leader of the growing ``Minjung'' or grass-roots school
of art that has evolved in South Korea in recent years as a
reaction to decades of authoritarian rule and the impact of
industrialization.
   Minjung artists, who have attracted a wide following among young
Korean artists, advocate using art to fight for democratic reform
by depicting the hardships of poor workers, peasants and slum
dwellers.
   ``Minjung art aims to expose the social evils and injustices in
society. It also participates in the movement of the masses,'' said
Lee, a quiet, gentle man who often smiles as he explains his ideas.
   The bold, realistic style of Minjung art and its bleak portrayal
of life are considered shocking in a society where artists
generally concentrate on landscapes or happy rural scenes.
   Minjung art is about the suffering of many Koreans who work long
hours for a very meager living and spend their lives in poverty,
Lee said. It also is about how industrialization has destroyed
traditional rural values and made life bleak and polluted, he said.
   Lee's bold woodcuts and portraits feature haggard men and women
drained by unrelenting labor and bleak, hopeless lives. A man claws
at the stony earth of his fields, a woman working at a sewing
machine in a factory dreams of heaven, a begger huddles in front of
a church.
   ``I want to instill a detailed, concrete sense of reality into
my works,'' he said.
   Many of Lee's subjects have disproportionately large hands and
feet that have become a trademark of his work. Lee says he doesn't
know why he makes feet and hands so large.
   Some critics have denounced the new style as violent and crude
political propaganda that is not art. ``Skepticism over the quality
of the works by Minjung artists lingers on,'' said one critic.
   Lee rejects charges that his work is crude propaganda. He
defends it as a reaction to decades of oppressive rule and says his
only goals are democracy and aiding the poor. ``You have to compare
our works with the violent nature of the political powers that
be,'' he said.
   But Lee also rejects the idea that he is a political artist,
saying his work is a repudiation of politics. ``Politics oppresses
humans,'' he said.
   Lee says his works are inspired by the hope that a fair society
based on greater equality and compassion can be built. He dreams of
a kinder, gentle world and says showing how people suffer can help
bring change.
   ``I'm not a radical,'' he said. ``I'm an optimist.''
   Minjung art is also anti-Western because its followers say that
Western influence has eroded traditional Korean values and brought
industrialization and other dehumanizing influences.
   ``Western influence has brought with it decadence,'' Lee said.
   Lee moved to the countryside two years ago because of concern
that industrialization was destroying traditional rural values. His
work often features a rural life he fears is slipping away.
   Some of Lee's works were recently displayed at a Seoul gallery.
A steady flow of visitors viewed the lines of stark woodcuts
displayed on whitewashed walls in the grimy, basement gallery.
   Lee admitted the show was a sign of political liberalization and
of how artists are allowed freedom. The government of President Roh
Tae-woo, which took office in February, has promised to end
authoritarian rule and allow complete freedom of expression.
   Lee makes a living as a book illustrator and spends much of his
time working to develop Minjung art. He says he wants to develop
the quality of the art and establish it alongside other artistic
schools.
   ``We are striving to give better forms and flesh to our ideas,''
he said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Thorogood and Co. Bring Bar Band to Arena Rock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the past decade, George Thorogood has gone
from playing hole-in-the-wall saloons to headlining stadiums. But
the whiskey-voiced rocker figures his career holds a few more
roadhouse bars before he hits the retirement home.
   ``I can't wait until I become a has-been _ a has-been that never
was, actually,'' he said with a cackle. ``I can't wait till that
happens, because I know I can make a living playing bars. And have
a lot of fun _ a great time.''
   Which is, he says, what his band The Destroyers are having now
on their national tour _ although Thorogood makes no bones about
saying they'd rather play Stubb's Barbecue, a small Texas blues
bar, than Madison Square Garden.
   ``We started out, and still are, a bar band,'' said Thorogood,
whose career has kept alive the sound of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf
and other blues legends. ``It's just that the bars are a little
bigger these days.''
   Thorogood and company are to blame for that. Since 1977, they've
cranked out a series of successful albums and singles, starting
with a remake of Hank Williams' ``Who Do You Love?'' on their debut
album and stretching to the current LP ``Born to Be Bad.''
   Despite his success, Thorogood has not catered to Top 40 radio,
studiously avoided studio tricks and stayed about as far from the
mainstream as any contemporary band can.
   ``Even if I tried, I'm not going to be able to get out of this
style of playing,'' Thorogood said during a Manhattan stop in the
tour. ``There might be a different hook here or there, but
basically it's going to be your two-, three-chord rock or your
slow, tough-guy blues.
   ``I don't want to change that, and I couldn't if I wanted o,
because I have tried _ I have sat down and tried to play other
styles of stuff, and it was a disaster.''
   With that in mind, Thorogood and band included some classic
covers on the new album: Elmore James' ``Shake Your Money Maker,''
Chuck Berry's ``You Can't Catch Me'' and Hank Snow's ``I'm Movin'
On.''
   Thorogood also wrote several songs in the same vein for ``Born
to Be Bad'' _ songs which, he stressed, carry no deeper message
than ``let's all have a good time.''
   ``I figure, I'm not operating on anybody's skull here. It's not
brain surgery, man,'' said Thorogood. ``It's just two chords. And
people are supposed to dance to it and laugh at it, and two hours
later forget about it. That's what entertainment is.''
   Thorogood was introduced to the blues scene in his native
Delaware, an area he quickly admits was no roots-rock hotbed.
   ``I was so foolish staying in the Philadelphia area, because
it's not a blues area,'' he said. ``If I had my wits about me, I
would have gone to San Francisco or Chicago, where people know this
sound their whole lives.''
   But no matter where he he grew up, Thorogood believes it was
inevitable he'd end up listening to Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry.
   ``I think the things you're supposed to hear in your life will
come to you. You don't go finding them; they come to you,'' he
said. ``So it just came to me a little later.''
   Once Thorogood heard the music, he began taking it to audiences
with the zeal of a Bible Belt preacher delivering the good word.
   The band is constantly on the road: In 1981, they went on a
``50-50 Tour'' in which they played in all 50 states on 50
consecutive dates.
   And while they have moved up from bars to arenas, Thorogood
figures that sooner or later he'll be back on the roadhouse circuit
playing for barroom crowds, enjoying his golden years with a cold
beer and some hot licks.
   ``I always thought, wow, wouldn't it be great if I did `Bad to
the Bone' and I was 60, and I had on a gut on me like (Jackie)
Gleason, and I walked out there with a T-shirt that said something
like, `Sex Machine.'''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Books That Flip, Flop and Fold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN OKULA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scholars entering Yale University's 3
million-volume Sterling Memorial Library are discovering there's
definitely more to a book than its cover.
   The library's ``Eccentric Books'' exhibit includes works
containing a rotting tortilla encased in plastic, a miniature
stand-up portrait of Humphrey Bogart and a three-dimensional
illustration of sperm fertilizing an egg.
   ``These are more-than-a-book books,'' says Gay Walker, the
library's arts of the book department curator who put together the
exhibit.
   The more than 110 books in the exhibit have flaps, fold-outs,
revolving wheels, unusual shapes, cutouts or objects such as a pair
of 3-D glasses. Although children's books are represented, most of
the volumes are aimed toward adult readers.
   Walker says the earliest known example of an eccentric book is
Johannes Mueller's 1474 ``Kalendar,'' also known as
``Regiomontanus.'' The text contains two cutout, movable discs tied
onto a diagram that shows the movements of the moon.
   The Yale exhibit has a fascimile of the book printed in 1937 as
well as several original copies of 16th-century books with
revolving diagrams by Petrus Apianus, the royal astronomer for
Charles V.
   Another early innovation was the flap, cutout paper pasted onto
a book page that either added to an illustration or revealed one
when lifted up.
   Euclid's ``Elements of Geometry,'' translated into English by H.
Billingsley and printed in London in 1570, was the oldest example
of a flapped book identified by Walker. It contains several
illustrations of geometrical figures that use flaps to illustrate
the solid figure, she says.
   Anatomy books also made early use of flaps revealing various
layers of the body by as early as 1573, Walker writes in a catalog
of the exhibition. Among them was George Spratt's 1833 ``Obstetric
Tables,'' which had several printings. Fifteen of its lithographed
plates contain a total of 50 flaps, with explicit illustrations.
   There are books with eccentricities in other fields besides the
sciences. In the exhibit are children's books with all kinds of
innovations, including one that folds out into a five-room
miniature house, landscape books, humor books, art books and many
more.
   Pull-tabs depress a computer key in one book and cause a robot's
pants to fall down in another. In ``The Great Movies Live'' by
Maxim Jakubowski and Ron Van der Meer, paper versions of screen
stars in famous scenes from flicks ranging from ``Casablanca'' to
``King Kong'' literally stand up from the pages.
   In ``100 Million Million Poems'' by Raymond Queneau, 14 lines of
poetry cut from 10 pages but still attached to the binding can be
combined into almost limitless poetic possibilities.
   Jonathon Miller's and David Pelham's ``The Facts of Life,''
published in 1984, uses tabs, wheels, flaps and moving and
stationary pop-ups in its illustrations, including one in blue and
gray showing the fertilization of a human egg.
   Included in a category that Walker labels artists' book, are
Wesleyan University artist and English Professor Joseph Reed's two
books made out of candy boxes. One is a Whitman Sampler box that
contains a mostly visual essay on Walt Whitman.
   The other, the ``Book of Eights'' has the eight dwarfs, a new
addition being Stuffy; the eight deadly sins, the eighth being
``boringness''; and the eight wonders of the modern world, which
include Trump Tower in New York and Graceland, the late Elvis
Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn.
   A 1977 volume of ``Eye,'' a Yale art magazine, contains the
plastic-encased tortilla.
   Eccentric books published today are especially popular in the
children's fields, says Walker. Pop-up books, popular in the
Victorian age, have been revived by Waldo H. Hunt, a Los Angeles
publisher, who manufactures them in Colombia, she says.
   Walker says the idea for the exhibition started when she was
invited to give a talk on any subject she chose, which ended up
being eccentric books.
   The librarian found that very little research had been done in
the area. She devised the categories such as flap and pop-up to
which she assigned the books.
   Walker also designed the exhibit's catalog, which contains two
pop-ups and a serrated edge. She produced the catalog on a home
computer, had its cover printed professionally and bound the
61-page work by hand at night in her home.
   The exhibit is open through April 15.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Fiddler Vassar Clements And `Hillbilly Jazz'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiddler Vassar Clements has played
country music, jazz, rock 'n' roll and classical for groups as
diverse as the Grateful Dead and the Boston Pops.
   And for the past two decades, he's recorded in the top studios
with his instrument. It's been a romance of sound separated only by
the styles he performs.
   ``When the rhythm is good, I can play it,'' Clements says.
   The 59-year-old artist has just released an album with the
intriguing title ``New Hillbilly Jazz.'' The name signifies a sound
as versatile as the man who plays it.
   ``It's heavy rhythm, solid, dynamic,'' he said in his soft
Southern voice that contrasts the exuberance of his playing. ``But
it's not fidgety music. It's smooth, danceable.''
   This marks his 20th year in Nashville where he's added luster to
the city's country style after relocating from Kissimmee, Fla.
   ``People ask me what kind of music I'm playing, and I say I
don't know,'' he said. ``It's just happy, moving music.''
   Along the way, he played with rock veterans the Grateful Dead on
their ``Wake of the Flood'' album and toured with them when they
were known as Old and In the Way.
   It was a departure from the country music he grew up playing
when he and his cousins formed a band.
   ``It was a challenge and I loved that,'' he recalled about his
days with the Dead. ``It's exciting to take a chance.''
   He also played with the Boston Pops, joining his close friend
John Hartford when Hartford was a guest artist in a Pops concert.
   In addition, he recorded with the Monkees. That was by
coincidence. He was working on a recording session when someone
asked him if he wanted to stay and play on another one.
   ``I didn't know until later it was the Monkees,'' he said.
   He's had no problem adjusting to the various styles, even on
short notice such as the Monkees' session. ``You just go in and do
it. After so many years, no tunes change much. I've never had a
problem with that.''
   Clements taught himself to play at age 7 and has no formal
training. The first song he learned was ``There's an Old Spinning
Wheel in the Parlor.''
   ``It took forever,'' he said.
   ``It was God's gift, something born in me,'' he said about his
talent. ``I was too dumb to learn it any other way. I listened to
the (Grand Ole) Opry some. I'd pick it up one note at a time. I was
young, with plenty of time and I didn't give up. You'd come home
from school, do your lessons and that's it. No other distractions.
   ``I don't read music. I play what I hear.''
   But he understands how helpful it is for youngsters to be
grounded in classical music and formal training. ``It should help
them,'' Clements said.
   He was employed at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a
year in the mid-1960s, working on plumbing. At various times, he
also worked in a Georgia paper mill, was a switchman for Atlantic
Coast Railroad, sold insurance and had a potato chip franchise.
   But music was always part of his life.
   ``I'd always play. Square dances, anything,'' he said.
   All the performing carried him to Nashville where one of his
first breaks was being featured on the album ``Will the Circle Be
Unbroken'' by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
   He then became heavily in demand for recording sessions of all
types. This year, he was nominated for a Grammy Award with French
jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli for their ``Together at Last.''
   ``It was a truly great time,'' he said about working with
Grappelli. ``It was a challenge, but it came easy. We felt alike on
a lot of things.''
   Clements won't say that he's getting better at playing, but
prefers to say that it just comes easier.
   ``If I quit improving, I'd have to quit. It would be work and
there'd be no sense staying in a rut and not learning anything. I'd
hate to play the same way all the time. It would become
mechanical.''
   Clements, who owns three fiddles and still practices some, has
no favorite song. ``When things go right, I enjoy playing all of
them, anything that comes up.''
   Similarly, he doesn't mind if his instrument is called a fiddle
or a violin.
   ``I say fiddle, but if someone says violin it doesn't matter.''

   Texaco Inc.'s time under bankruptcy court
protection may be drawing nearer a close as the last shareholder
votes are counted on a proposed financial reorganization plan.
   At a hearing beginning today in White Plains, N.Y., U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard Schwartzberg is expected to announce
the result of that balloting and listen to final comments by
parties to the case.
   The judge then must decide whether or not to confirm the plan,
enabling Texaco to step from under court protection under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   Texaco filed for protection from its creditors last April to
avoid having to post a multibillion-dollar bond while appealing a
$10.3 billion judgment held against it by Pennzoil Co.

   A federal judge has threatened to fine Eastern
Airlines $10,000 per day for future breaches of a court order that
has blocked the carrier from trying to sell its profitable East
Coast air shuttle.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt also on Monday ordered Eastern
to halt its efforts to gain federal permission to complete the
proposed deal.
   Pratt wrote that in attempting to sell its shuttle, Eastern had
engaged in ``deliberate and intentional conduct'' that violated a
ruling the judge issued last summer. That July 2 order had

<HEAD>Roper To Study Revised GE Bid On Heels Of GE Lawsuit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Roper Corp., which resisted General Electric
Co.'s previous moves to snatch it from Whirlpool Corp., says it
will study GE's latest, sweetened $507 million buyout offer.
   The giant appliance maker's new offer for Roper came on Monday
just hours after GE filed suit challenging Roper's agreement to
merge with Whirlpool in a $470 million deal.
   GE on Monday increased its tender offer for Roper's outstanding
shares by $9 to $54 a share, topping Whirlpool's $50-a-share offer
in a bidding war that, according to some analysts, may have run its
course.
   ``The prices are pretty generous to what we on Wall Street would
call the intrinsic value of Roper,'' said Cornelius Sewell, an
analyst with Argus Research Corp.
   Roper rose $2.50 a share to close at $55.50 in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading, adding to Friday's $5.75 a share runup.
   In a statement issued after the stock market closed, Roper said
it was reviewing GE's new tender offer and planned a board meeting
later in the week to determine the company's position on the
sweetened bid.
   Whirlpool began the legal battle last week, suing GE on the
grounds the Fairfield, Conn.-based conglomerate tried to
``sabotage'' a Whirlpool-Roper merger with a competing bid.
   GE said Roper rebuffed a merger proposal last November, and
contended the Roper board authorized a $37.50-a-share merger with
Whirlpool after Whirlpool threatened to mount a hostile takeover
bid, according to Delaware State Court documents.
   GE, which on March 6 made its initial $45-a-share offer, alleged
Roper failed to ``test the price'' before agreeing to merge with
Whirlpool. GE also contended Roper concealed GE's interest in the
company when it advised shareholders to tender their stock to
Whirlpool.
   Roper also gave Benton Harbor, Mich.-based Whirlpool a so-called
``lockup option'' to purchase 1.6 million newly issued shares for
$37.50 each if their deal fell through, which would make any
subsequent Roper acquisition more expensive. GE is seeking to block
the issue and transfer of those shares.
   In a separate suit filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware, GE
claimed both Whirlpool and Roper failed to adequately disclose
terms of their merger agreement under Securities and Exchange
Commission laws and neglected to mention GE's interest in Roper.
   Whirlpool alleged in its suit last week that a GE executive
tried to persuade Roper to break its contract with Whirlpool. The
suit said GE ``intentionally, maliciously and unjustifiedly engaged
in a continuing course of conduct to sabotage'' the deal.
   Part of Whirlpool's lawsuit seeks $117 million in damages, or
the difference between its $50-a-share offer and original offer.
   GE vowed to ``vigorously defend itself'' against the charges and
is seeking to transfer the suit from U.S. District Court in Grand
Rapids, Mich., to federal court in Delaware.
   Roper, headquartered in Augusta, Ga., last week endorsed
Whirlpool's sweetened bid. Robert Cook, Roper's president and chief
executive officer, said then that the company ``has a strong desire
to see this combination successfully completed,'' although he had
no further comment when contacted Monday.
   David Whitwam, Whirlpool's president and chief executive, stated
Monday that his company remains committed to pursuing its attempts
to block GE and acquire Roper.
   Analysts say a Roper-Whirlpool merger would move Whirlpool ahead
of GE as the nation's leading appliance maker. For GE, acquiring
the appliance and lawn equipment maker would enhance its supplier
relationship with Sears, Roebuck & Co. and give it a valuable share
of the gas stove market.
   Analysts estimate that roughly two-thirds of Roper's sales come
from its agreement to supply Sears with its kitchen appliance and
lawn equipment products.
   GE's bid stems from its decision last year to expand its market
share by selling gas stoves. Rather than manufacture the gas
stoves, GE now purchases them from four companies, including Roper,
said GE spokesman Jack Batty.

   Still smarting from a major courtroom defeat
last week, Campeau Corp. says it is working on other options in its
battle to acquire Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Campeau got another legal setback on Monday and faces further
courtroom entanglements over its attempt to acquire Federated,
which has accepted a rival offer from R.H. Macy & Co. Inc.
   A federal judge on Monday rebuffed Campeau's proposal to extend
its $6.18 billion tender offer so it would expire simultaneously
with Macy's offer, if he removed Federated's ``poison pill''
takeover defense.
   Judge Leonard Sand, in a closed-door session, said the poison
pill would remain in place at least until Federated makes a final
recommendation to its shareholders, said Campeau spokeswoman Nancy
Raeside.
   In a key ruling on Friday, the judge had denied Campeau's
request to block the use of Federated's poison pill, which Campeau
says will prevent it from completing any takeover of Federated.
   The defense makes a takeover prohibitively expensive by allowing
Federated shareholders to buy more of the company's stock at a
steep discount.
   Margaret Nicolaides, a Campeau spokeswoman, said the
Toronto-based developer was ``definitely working on other
options.'' She said she could not elaborate on what those options
were.
   However, there were reports that Campeau was considering
sweetening its bid or proposing a friendly merger. Neither tactic
has met with success in the past during the company's months-long
quest for Federated.
   In another matter, Judge Sand scheduled a Wednesday hearing over
a Macy complaint that Campeau made false statements in full-page
advertisements in Thursday editions of the New York Times and Wall
Street Journal.
   Separately, Macy announced that the waiting period during which
the federal government could ask for information about the possible
antitrust implications of a Macy-Federated merger had expired with
no further requests. A request would extend the waiting period
automatically.
   The retailer also confirmed it had agreed to sell 11 of
Federated's 14 Abraham & Straus stores if it wins the takeover
fight. The agreement, reached with New York state Attorney General
Robert Abrams over the weekend, calls for Macy to divest New
York-area A&S stores because they are in direct competition with
Macy branches.
   In Georgia, where Macy stores would compete with Federated's
Rich's chain, Attorney General Michael Bowers said the state will
not oppose a Macy-Federated combination. But analysts speculate
that Macy might sell the Rich's stores anyway.
   Macy is conducting a $6.3 billion tender offer for Federated
under an agreement with Federated management.
   Macy is offering $77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million
Federated shares, for a total of $5.4 billion. Macy would exchange
shares in the merged company, Macy's-Federated Inc., and issue
convertible debt securities for the remainder of Federated's 89.5
million outstanding shares. Analysts have estimated the total value
of the offer at $6.3 billion.
   Federated stock rose 62{ cents to $66.87{ in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Monday.
   Campeau's bid is a two-step, all-cash package that would be
worth $68 a share, or $6.18 billion. It is offering $75 each for
70.5 million Federated shares, and proposes to acquire the
remaining stock for $44 cash per share in a subsequent merger.
   Macy's offer expires at midnight EST April 4. The Campeau offer
must remain open at least until midnight Friday, pending a
Securities and Exchange Commission ruling on whether Campeau must
submit documents on its financing for the takeover.

   The union trying to prevent Eastern Airlines
from selling its lucrative East Coast air shuttle says it is happy
with penalties a federal judge has levied on the carrier, but the
company says it plans to appeal the sanctions.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt on Monday said he would fine
Eastern $10,000 per day if the airline commits any future
violations of a court order that had blocked the shuttle deal.
   Pratt also ordered Eastern to halt all efforts to get government
permission to go through with the sale. And he said the airline's
top officials would have to write to all 32,000 Eastern employees,
informing them that the carrier had flouted an earlier court order
and promising that no further violations would occur.
   ``He imposed most of the sanctions we asked for,'' Edgar N.
James, a lawyer for the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers said. ``There weren't any surprises, but it's
pretty strong.''
   But company officials insisted their court fight was not over.
   ``Eastern continues to believe strongly that we have not
violated any court orders,'' the company said in a written
statement read by spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak from the airline's
headquarters in Miami.
   John J. Gallagher, Eastern's attorney, said the airline would go
to court today to appeal the penalty and the original finding of
contempt.
   Pratt found Eastern in contempt on March 10 for violating an
order he had issued July 2. That order had forbidden the company
from changing working conditions of the 12,000 mechanics and other
ground workers represented by the machinists.
   Eastern, owned by Texas Air Corp., announced Feb. 5 that it
would sell its shuttle to a newly created Texas Air subsidiary for
$225 million. The shuttle flies between Washington, New York and
Boston.
   Frank Lorenzo, chief executive of Texas Air and Eastern, has
argued that financially ailing Eastern needed the cash. But union
leaders have insisted the move was aimed at stripping labor of
power at the carrier by transferring thousands of workers to
another corporate entity within Texas Air.
   The machinists' union had asked Pratt to force a court
appearance by Lorenzo to discuss the shuttle deal. But in his
ruling Monday, Pratt said Lorenzo could send another corporate
representative.
   The union had also asked Pratt to fine Eastern $20,000 daily for
future violations of the judge's orders. The judge instead ruled
the airline would face $10,000-a-day fines for violations committed
after April 5.
   Pratt did not grant a union request that the airline restore the
jobs of all Eastern employees who quit because of the announcement
that the shuttle would be sold.
   In 1986, Texas Air, also the corporate parent of Continental
Airlines, took over Eastern, a large carrier that lost $182 million
last year.
   Since that time, Lorenzo has sought wage concessions from unions
and has tried selling several of Eastern's most profitable assets
to other Texas Air subsidiaries that he also controls. Unions
representing Eastern employees have waged well-publicized fights to
thwart him.

<HEAD>Investor Group Offers $60 a Share for Kansas City Southern
Industries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Howard Kaskel, who says his plans to
boost shareholder values have been rebufffed repeatedly by Kansas
City Southern Industries Inc., is moving to take over the company.
   An investment group led by Kaskel said Monday it was offering
$60 cash a share, or about $594 million, for the 89 percent of the
railroad concern's common stock that it does not already own.
   The New York investor, in a letter to the company's management,
also indicated he would attempt to place his own slate of directors
on the Kansas City Southern board if it rejected or failed to act
on the buyout offer by April 4.
   Kansas City Southern, which also has interests in financial
services, said its board would consider the all-cash proposal soon
at a special meeting.
   The company has nearly 11.1 million shares outstanding, and the
Kaskel group claims it controls about 1.2 million shares.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Kansas City Southern jumped
$8.75 a share to $55 on Monday.
   Kaskel outlined the merger proposal in a letter to Landon H.
Rowland, president and chief executive of Kansas City Southern, and
requested an opportunity to negotiate ``all aspects of the offer,
including price.''
   He said completing the proposal was subject to reaching a
definitive agreement, approval by the requisite number of directors
and stockholders and satisfaction of all regulatory requirements.
   Kaskel said he had made various proposals to company management
over the past eight months on ways to maximize shareholder values.
   ``Unfortunately, you have rejected each of my suggestions,''
Kaskel wrote.
   In addition, he said he found it ``dismaying'' that the board
erected obstacles ``designed to entrench itself and to prevent
stockholders from realizing a full return on their investment.''
   Among these steps, Kaskel cited the recent issuance of about 1.4
million shares, or almost 15 percent of the company's
then-outstanding common stock, to employee stock ownership plans at
$49 a share.
   ``This could only have been motivated by the board's desire to
place substantial voting power in its hands as a means of
opposing'' proposals that may be brought before its shareholders,
the letter read.
   Kaskel also cited Kansas City Southern's continued efforts to
acquire the Southern Pacific Railroad despite Southern Pacific's
``binding agreement for its sale to the Denver Rio Grande.''
   Other than Rowland's announcement that the board of directors
would consider the offer at a special meeting, Kansas City Southern
indicated it had no further comment until the board had an
opportunity to study the offer.
   Kansas City Southern owns the Kansas City Southern Railroad,
which operates on about 1,500 miles of track in Missouri, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas.
   It also owns 87 percent of DST Systems Inc., a Kansas City-based
concern that provides data systems and record-keeping services for
mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services
providers.
   The company also owns 80 percent of Janus Capital Corp., a
Denver-based concern that provides investment advice and had about
$915 million in funds under management at the end of February,
according to Kansas City Southern's vice president and secretary,
Albert Mauro.
   For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, Kansas City Southern reported
a profit of $17.7 million, or $1.82 a share, on revenue of $507.6
million.

<HEAD>Beazer Willing To Acquire Part of Koppers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British investor pursuing a hostile
takeover of Koppers Co. says he is willing to acquire only the
company's core construction materials business _ which the company
already has said it may sell as a defensive measure.
   Brian C. Beazer, who along with the investment firm Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. has offered to acquire Koppers for $56 a share,
or $1.6 billion, made his offer in a letter to Koppers chairman
Charles R. Pullin on Saturday.
   In the letter, the bidders raised their offer to $56 a share
from the initial $45 a share bid rejected by Koppers, which also
manufactures chemicals.
   Beazer, chairman of the British construction company Beazer PLC,
said previously he would sell the chemicals business if he gained
control of Koppers. His new offer remains open until April 1.
   Koppers has stated that under a defensive recapitalization plan
it is contemplating, it might sell part or all of the construction
materials business to third parties.
   Selling the businesses to Beazer might save the rest of Koppers,
but ``I don't know how bright a move that would be,'' said
securities analyst Gregory Drahuschak of Butcher & Singer in
Pittsburgh. ``It's the lion's share of the company's earnings and
revenue.''
   The construction materials and paving services businesses are on
solid footing after five years of retrenchment at Koppers, he said.
The company reported 1987 earnings of $10.8 million on revenue of
$1.5 billion.
   ``The real persistent grower for the corporation has been the
construction materials business,'' said Robert Kanters, analyst for
Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Pittsburgh. ``The chemicals
business, they feel, is able to do some sustainable growth, but
it's been kind of a more volatile business in recent years.''
   Koppers stock rose $3.75 a share to $57.50 on Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Beazer proposed meeting Pullin as early as Sunday, but no
meeting was held and none has been planned, Koppers spokesman
Robert O'Gara said Monday.
   O'Gara declined further comment beyond Sunday's announcement
that management would study Beazer's latest proposals.

<TEXT>
   Southland Corp. is raising $320 million in
financing for its recent leveraged buyout through a loan from its
convenience store licensee in Japan.
   Principal and interest on the loan from Seven-Eleven Japan Co.
Ltd., will be repaid from future royalties the company owes
Southland for use of the 7-Eleven name, Southland said Monday.
   Of the loan proceeds, $300 million will be applied toward
repayment of debt incurred in the recently completed $4.9 billion
leveraged buy-out, which took the company private, officials said.
   ``What we're doing is borrowing against the value of future
royalties so we can have cash in hand right now to repay more
expensive debt that we incurred in the leveraged buy-out,'' said
Southland spokeswoman Cecilia Norwood.
   Seven-Eleven Japan opened its first store in Tokyo in 1974 and
currently operates about 3,300 7-Eleven stores in Japan.
   The $320 million _ 41 billion yen _ reflects more than 10 years
worth of future royalties, Ms. Norwood said.
   Southland operates 8,000 7-Eleven and other convenience units in
the United States and Canada, as well as Southland Food Division's
six food centers. Area licenses and affiliates operate more than
4,100 7-Eleven stores in 16 foreign countries.
   Southland also owns half interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp.
   Citicorp International, Ltd., arranged the financing in
conjunction with Diamond Lease Company, Ltd., and Tokyo Leasing
Company, Ltd., which acted as lead managers for a syndicate of
Japanese financial institutions, Southland said.

   Best Western is trying to become Best
Eastern as well.
   The Phoenix-based hotel company says it is undertaking a global
expansion that it hopes will extend its reach to Japan, China and
10 other Asian nations.
   Best Western International Inc. already has affiliate lodging
properties in 33 countries in North America, Europe, the Middle
East and the South Pacific.
   By April, a Hong Kong office will be opened by Carlton Hotels
International of Canada, which will act as recruiting agent for
Best Western in 11 countries, including China. The other countries
are the Phillipines, Taiwan, Brunei, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and South Korea.
   Ron Evans, Best Western chief executive officer, said the
company conservatively plans to have links to at least 20 more
hotels within three years through the venture with Carlton and that
company's overseas connections.
   Carlton already is involved in joint venture projects with the
government in China and its development arm is active throughout
Southeast Asia.
   Best Western separately will seek out new member properties in
Japan.
   The efforts are part of a master plan to have Best Western
operations in 50 countries by 1992, increasing its member
properties from some 3,300 to about 4,200.
   The chain also will seek properties in South America, Greece,
Turkey and some African countries.
   Best Western enters the relationship with Carlton already having
made an initial entry into the region by opening a Best Western
Garden Hotel in Singapore last year.
   Evans said Best Western's properties in Asia ``will reflect the
local traditions and ambience, the local architecture.''
   ``That's why foreign countries like Best Western,'' he said.
``We are not converting (foreignn properties) to a cookie-cutter
image. They keep their cultural traditions. We are there only to
enhance their bottom lines.''

   The dollar was mixed but generally firmer in early
European trading today. Gold prices eased.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 127.07 yen, down 1.28 yen from Friday.
   But the Tokyo finish was an improvement on trading in Europe on
Monday, when Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday
and the dollar closed in London at 126.85 yen.
   In later trading in London today, the dollar was quoted at
127.30 yen.
   Dealers in Tokyo blamed the drop largely on fears the U.S. trade
deficit will grow in the second half of this year.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.6915 West German marks, up from 1.6880; 1.3980
Swiss francs, up from 1.3970; 5.7505 French francs, up from 5.7380;
1.8964 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8970; 1,252.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,249.25; and 1.2472 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2494.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8285, unchanged
from late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $450.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $449.50, but then fell back. At
mid-morning today the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $449.40.
   In Zurich the noon bid price was $449.45, down from $450.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.61 an ounce to close at a bid
$451.87.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.37 a troy

   The dollar fell 1.28 yen on Tokyo foreign exchange
markets today and the leading stock index fell more than 123 points
following declines on markets in London and New York.
   Traders in Tokyo blamed fears over the increasing U.S. trade
deficit and increasing interest rates in the United States for the
declines.
   The dollar opened at 126.96 yen, down 1.39 yen from its close
Friday, when it gained 0.92 yen. Monday was a Japanese national
holiday. In today's trading, the dollar ranged between 126.80 yen

   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which gained 93.97 points Friday, closed at 25,842.75 points, down
123.51 points, or 0.48 percent.
   Stephen Jennings, a trader for Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo, said
the yen will continue to strengthen based on worries over the U.S.
trade deficit and increasing interest rates as reflected in bond
market increases from 8.5 percent to 8.72 percent.
   He predicted the yen will continue to strengthen and could hit
115 to the dollar by the end of the year if the present trends
continue.
   ``We just don't expect the trade deficit to improve in the
United States,'' he said. ``We expect the decline to begin in the
second half of this year.''
   The dollar's sharp decline in early trading today followed
similar declines on overseas markets Monday, said a currency dealer
at Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo. The dollar closed down 0.90 yen in New
York and down 1.40 yen in London in Monday's trading.
   ``Tokyo was looking at what was happening in foreign markets and
that caused the dollar to fall below 127 yen,'' said the dealer,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the Bank of Japan intervened slightly to support the
U.S. currency.

   Stock prices were narrowly mixed at midday
Tuesday, with trading depressed by declines in New York and Tokyo
and by the lack of institutional buying interest in the market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks was off
3.6 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,837.5.
   Volume was a modest 211.7 million shares, up from 191.7 million
shares at the same time a day earlier.
   The market remained locked in a narrow range on Tuesday with
institutions again reluctant to buy stock near the start of the
current extended trading account, dealers said. The small size of
individual share transactions indicated that Tuesday's trading was
dominated by private client orders rather than institutional
investors, they added.
   Investors have been reluctant to take major decisions at the
start of the three-week account which began last Friday, extended
from the normal two-week period to take in the Easter holiday
weekend.
   The London Stock Exchange divides trading into either two-week
or three-week periods for accounting purposes. Trades generally
must be completed within 10 days of a period ending.
   London share prices also were depressed Tuesday by previous
falls in New York and Tokyo, dealers said.

^Durable Goods Orders Fell Sharply Last Month</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket'' durable goods
continued to fall sharply in February, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last at least three years, totaled a seasonally
adjusted $111.4 billion last month, a 1.8 percent decline which was
identical to the drop in January.
   It was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable
goods orders had been down for two consecutive months.
   The back-to-back drops surprised analysts, who had been
predicting that orders would turn up again in February following a
January decline which was blamed on volatility in the aircraft
sector.
   Separately, the Treasury Department said Monday the federal
government ran a $23.9 billion budget deficit in February,
following a rare surplus the previous month.
   The $16.1 billion January surplus occurred because that month's
Social Security checks were mailed early and counted in the
December spending figures.
   For the first five months of the current budget year, the
government has run up a deficit of $89.7 billion, 4.9 percent lower
than the deficit incurred in the same period a year ago, according
to Treasury calculations.
   On Wall Street, analysts blamed inflation fears and lingering
post-crash anxiety for the broad decline in stock prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell sharply at the
opening and remaining lower throughout the session, closing down
20.23 points at 2,067.14. Broader market indices also fell.
   On the bond market, analysts said prices slipped and interest
rates edged up in light trading that reflected continued
uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and the economy.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell \ point, or
about $2.50 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield rose to
8.70 percent from 8.67 percent late Friday.
   Foreign exchange trading also was quiet, with the dollar
responding to declines in stocks and bonds by dropping against all
major currencies except the Canadian dollar.
   Oil futures prices rallied, with crude piercing the $17-a-barrel
level before sliding back in late trading following a statement by
Saudi King Fahd on prices and production.
   Fahd suggested that cheating on production quotas and prices by
some members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries encouraged further weakness in prices.
   That punctured the rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
where contracts for April delivery of West Texas Intemediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude oil, closed at $16.49 per barrel, down 9 cents
from Friday. The April contract had been up as much as 45 cents
during the day.

   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods fell again sharply in February, the government said
today in a report that surprised analysts who had been looking for
a rebound.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$111.4 billion last month, a 1.8 percent decline which was
identical to the drop in January.
   It was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable
goods orders had been down for two consecutive months. The
back-to-back declines were the largest since a 2.3 percent plunge
last August.
   The two drops surprised analysts, who had been predicting that
orders would turn up again in February following a January decline
which was blamed on volatility in the aircraft sector.
   The weakness provides evidence that the economy slowed during
the early part of 1988 as businesses cut back on orders in an
effort to get control of bulging inventories.
   ``The economy is weak. It hasn't fully recovered from the stock
market fallout,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington
forecasting firm.
   But Evans, who earlier had been forecasting a recession, said he
now believes the country will be able to muddle through without a
downturn during this presidential election year.
   He said he was expecting overall economic growth, as measured by
the gross national production, to average around 1.8 percent in the
first three months of the year, down from GNP growth of 4.5 in the
fourth quarter.
   The weakness last month was widespread, with only the
transportation sector showing any strength. Orders for cars, trucks
and aircraft showed a 3.5 percent gain to $29.3 billion following a
9 percent drop in January.
   Orders in the volatile defense category fell 7.9 percent to $7.8
billion. Without this decline, total orders would have fallen a
slightly smaller 1.3 percent.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good
indicator of industry investment plans, fell 5.9 percent last
month. This sector is expected to provide much of the strength for
the economy this year as businesses step up investment spending to
meet growing export demand.
   Orders for electrical machinery fell 7.3 percent while orders in
the non-electrical machinery sector were down 8.8 percent, the
biggest drop for any sector.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel dropped 0.2 percent
following a 14.4 percent plunge in January.
   Shipments of durable goods dipped 0.1 percent in February to
$108.8 billion as a large decline in machinery shipments was
partially offset by an increase in transportation.

<HEAD>Trades Union Congress Backs Single-Union Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Trades Union Congress committee belatedly voted
Tuesday to back a single-union deal at an electronic components
plant that Ford Motor Co. has scrapped.
   Ford decided against opening the $73 million plant in Dundee,
Scotland after it was unable to win a single-union agreement, and
the automaker said Tuesday that despite the committee's vote, its
decision was irrevocable.
   Ford had reached an agreement with the Amalgamated Engineering
Union to represent the expected 450 workers at the plant, but other
unions representing workers at 21 Ford plants in Britain balked at
the plan.
   Ford's decision caused an uproar in Britain, where unions have
been squabbling among themselves about how best to counter the
erosion of their power under Conservative Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   The unions are particularly divided about whether to accept
single-union and no-strike deals, which have become more common in
Britain in recent years.
   On Tuesday, members of the finance and general purposes
committee of the Trades Union Congress, Britain's large umbrella
labor organization, voted 11 to 10 to back the single-union deal.
   The decision goes to the TUC's general council on Wednesday for
ratification.
   Gavin Laird, general secretary of the engineering union, said he
would fly to Detroit to ask Ford executives to reverse their
decision after the ratification.
   But Britain's and Ford's biggest union, the Transport and
Workers General Union, held out against a single union agreement.
   Ford blamed the failure of the unions to reach agreement for its
decision to cancel the deal.
   In Detroit Tuesday, Ford spokesman John Emmert said the company
still considered its decision as final.
   ``We certainly intended it to be irrevocable, and I don't have
anything in mind which would suggest that it isn't,'' Emmert said
in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.

<TEXT>
   Merv Griffin today boosted his bid to acquire
Resorts International Inc. to $295 million while also waging a
court fight to help him win control of the hotel-casino company.
   Griffin Co., the entertainer-businessman's private investment
company, said in a statement today that it decided to increase its
initial bid of $225 million, or $35-a-share, after reviewing
``appraisals regarding the value of Resorts.''
   Based on 6.43 million Class A and Class B shares outstanding,
Griffin's latest bid for both classes of stock is valued at about
$46 a share.
   Separately, Griffin said Monday it filed a $500 million federal
lawsuit in New York against real estate developer Donald Trump and
Resorts' directors, claiming breach of fiduciary duty to
shareholders, among other things.
   Trump, who has voting control of Resorts and is the company's
chairman, sued Griffin last week, accusing the entertainer of
interfering with Trump's contractual agreement to acquire complete
control over Resorts.
   Since making its initial offer Thursday, the Griffin Co. has
indicated it may raise the price if justified by non-public
information from Resorts, a hotel-casino concern with operations in
Atlantic City, N.J. and the Bahamas. Griffin said Trump made that
information available late last week.
   Trump, who is making his own $22-per-share bid for the Resorts
stock he doesn't already own, said he won't boost his offer and has
maintained that he will not sell his shares to Griffin.
   Resorts' board said it decided not to pursue Griffin's initial
bid because, in light of Trump's rejection, the issue was moot.
   Griffin said in a statement today that he would not approve any
deal between Resorts and Trump ``unless class A shareholders
receive a premium over my prior $35-a-share offer.''
   The non-public documents were contained in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing Trump made on Friday to supplement his
tender offer for Resorts.
   Trump's tender offer, which had been scheduled to expire Monday,
was extended until 12:01 a.m. EST on April 1.
   Griffin's president, Michael Nigris, said the documents included
a $1.3 billion appraisal of Resorts' properties, including a
when-completed value for its luxurious but troubled Taj Mahal
hotel-casino in Atlantic City.
   The appraiser further said it was prepared to support a bank
mortgage loan of $550 million guaranteed by Resorts, Nigris said.
   ``Based on those numbers, we may be able to sweeten our $225
million bid,'' Nigris said Monday.
   The $550 million mortgage is the amount Trump has said will be
needed to complete the Taj Mahal. When Resorts began work on the
project in 1984, it estimated the total price at $535 million. That
figure has since soared to $938.5 million based on Trump's
estimates.
   Trump became involved with Resorts last year when the company
ran into financial difficulties with the proposed 42-floor,
1,250-room Taj Mahal. He bought up most of Resorts' Class B common
stock, which carries 100 votes per share, thus giving him 88
percent voting control.
   He also pledged to help arrange financing for the costly Taj
Mahal project and, in exchange, was granted a five-year operating
contract for Resorts properties valued at about $100 million.
   Resorts has 752,000 Class B shares. It has 5.7 million Class A
shares that carry one vote each.

   In this corner: affable, courtly and somewhat
portly Mervyn Edward Griffin, the singer and talk show host who in
recent years has emerged as a wily and successful businessman.
   And in the far corner: brash New York real estate developer
Donald J. Trump, best known for building designer-label
skyscrapers, owning casinos and having more than a modest dose of
braggadocio.
   Late last week, Griffin and Trump squared off over control of
Resorts International Inc., the New Jersey-based hotel-casino
concern that Trump has been offering to acquire for $22 per share,
or about to acquire. Griffin last week offered $35 per share, or
$225 million for the Atlantic City-based company, which also has
operations in the Bahamas.
   The battle escalated today when Griffin increased his bid to
$295 million, which values both Class A and Class B Resorts shares
at about $46 each.
   Both contestants among America's wealthiest men. Trump is listed
by Forbes magazine as worth at least $850 million, and personally
claims $3 billion in wealth. Forbes lists Griffin as worth $300
million.
   For 23 years, Griffin served as host of the popular ``Merv
Griffin Show,'' one of TV's longest-running series, winning 10 Emmy
Awards in the process.
   In 1986, he sold privately-held Merv Griffin Enterprises _
producer of the ``Merv Griffin Show'' and two of his other
successful creations, ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy'' _ to
Coca-Cola Co. for a reported $250 million. But he remains chairman
of the company, and there is speculation he may take over as host
of ``Wheel of Fortune'' when host Pat Sajak leaves to do his own
show.
   Unlike many entertainers who squander their money through bad
investments and mismanagement, the 63-year-old Griffin has earned a
reputation in Hollywood as a shrewd businessman.
   He has parlayed his entertainment fortune into a business empire
that includes radio stations, a major closed-circuit television
operation widely used at racetracks, and extensive real estate
holdings in Beverly Hills and Northern California.
   Griffin, whose hobbies are music, tennis and good food, lives
stylishly, but not ostentatiously, in a 10,000-square-foot Beverly
Hills mansion near the homes of MCA Inc. Chairman Lew Wasserman and
investor Marvin Davis.
   By contrast, the 42-year-old Trump, who in a decade transformed
himself from a local landlord into a national real estate mogul,
has worked hard to make his name synonymous with ostentation.
   He routinely travels in one of his fleet of five helicopters.
When William Bricker was ousted as chief executive of Dallas-based
Diamond Shamrock Corp. amid criticism over his imperial lifestyle,
Trump purchased his luxurious Boeing 727 private jet.
   His primary home is a $10 million triplex penthouse atop his
glitzy Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. For relaxation, he
retreats to his 118-room mansion in West Palm Beach, Fla., or his
15-bedroom Georgian manor in Greenwich, Conn.
   ``I can't afford for things not to be the best,'' Trump has
said, contending the glamour attached to his name _ and the
buildings that bear his name _ allows him to attract prices of
$1,700 per square foot for some of his New York condos.
   With a massive war chest to spend, Trump was attracted by the
lure of profits in takeover speculation. In the past year, he
bought stakes in Allegis Corp., Holiday Corp. and Bally Mfg. Co.,
and raked in about $122 million in profits when he later sold the
stock to the company or rival suitors.
   Earlier this year, Trump said he was considering buying up to
24.9 percent of entertainment conglomerate MCA, the parent of
Universal Studios which is frequently mentioned as a takeover
target. But nothing has come of it.
   Likewise, nothing has come of his indications in January that he
might buy up to 15 percent of Federated Department Stores Inc. _
which later became the takeover target of Campeau Corp.
   But when Griffin decided to battle Trump for Resorts, the fight
generally was expected to be short and victorious for Trump.
   Griffin is offering more money, but Trump holds 88 percent of
Resorts' voting power through his ownership of nearly all of its
Class B common stock, which carries 100 votes per share.
   Trump has insisted he will oppose Griffin's proposal, and for
that reason Resorts' board decided it was moot to pursue the issue
with the entertainer.
   But Griffin has persisted. On Monday, he slapped Trump and
Resorts' directors with a $500 million lawsuit, accusing them,
among other things, of breach of fiduciary duty.
   That action came after Trump on Friday filed a $250 million suit
against Griffin and his allies, claiming fraud, stock market
manipulation and interference with Trump's contractual arrangements
with Resorts.
   Meanwhile, some holders of Resorts' 5.7 million Class A shares
who had earlier indicated they would support Trump's $22-per-share
offer now are having second thoughts, their lawyers say.

<TEXT>
   A unanimous Supreme Court today ruled that
states are barred from regulating the way interstate natural gas
companies issue securities to finance their operations.
   The court, ruling in a dispute between the Michigan Public
Service Commission and a Detroit-based pipeline, said the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission has sole authority to regulate such
financing.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said the state
authority sought by the Michigan agency is pre-empted by the
federal Natural Gas Act of 1938.
   A federal appeals court previously had ruled against the
Michigan authorities.
   Michigan law required pipeline companies to get advance approval
from the state Public Service Commission before issuing securities.
   The law was passed to assure that the securities were being
issued for a legal purpose _ one related to the more efficient
delivery of natural gas.
   The regulatory law was challenged in 1984 by American Natural
Resources, which operates a pipeline system carrying natural gas to
distribution customers in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
   According to court documents, the ANR has plans to issue $150
million in securities to help finance projects costing about $560
million.

   Stocks turned mixed today, strengthened by
higher bond prices and takeover-related buying, but restrained by
investor reluctance to participate in a market still suffering
post-crash uncertainty.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.16 points to
2,068.30 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange's
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.10 to 151.57. The
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.20 to 298.38.
   Gaining issues barely outnumbered losers on the NYSE, with 613
up, 558 down and 527 unchanged. Volume totaled 45.5 million shares
after 90 minutes.
   Rising prices in the bond market injected some optimism on Wall
Street because they dampened anxiety over inflation and higher
interest rates. Bonds were buoyed by lower oil prices and a
government report that showed a surprising drop in factory orders
for durable goods in February.
   Some stocks also were boosted by rumored and actual takeovers,
reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past
several weeks.
   Nevertheless, stockbrokers said the relatively low volume of
trading and the lack of any significant economic signals showed
that many investors remain reluctant to re-enter the market in the
aftermath of the October crash.
   ``People still are wounded,'' said Philip C. Puccio, manager of
institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co. ``Those wounds have not
scarred over yet. There's fear we could be looking at another
downdraft.''
   Among the most active issues, Lucky Stores shot up 14\ to 46{
after rival chain American Stores announced a $45-a-share tender
offer for the company. Kansas City Southern, target of a
$60-a-share takeover attempt by a New York investor group, advanced
2~ to 57~.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrials dropped 20.23 to 2,067.14.
Losing issues outnumbered gainers by about 2-to-1 on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,042 down, 502 up and 444 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 128.83 million shares against 245.75
million shares the previous session. It was the lowest level since
a 111.58 million-share day Dec. 29.

amended reorganization plan as the result of a court hearing on the
adequacy of the company's disclosure statement.
   U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. and U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Blackwell N. Shelley conducted the hearing Monday, listening
to a series of objections to the disclosure statement.
   The document is the basis by which women with Dalkon Shield
injury claims and other creditors of Robins will decide how to vote
on the company's reorganization plan.
   Robins spokesman Roscoe E. Puckett Jr. said Monday evening that
as a result of the hearing, the company ``will submit a sixth
amended and restated plan of reorganization incorporating certain
changes,'' mostly in the wording of the statement. The new plan
will be filed in bankruptcy court by March 28, he said.
   Merhige set an April 25 deadline for mailing the plan of
reorganization to Dalkon Shield claimants and the company's other
creditors for a vote. The votes must be received by July 11 and a
confirmation hearing will be July 18, Puckett said.
   Merhige also said he hoped to choose by April 11 the five
trustees who will administer the nearly $2.5 billion compensation
fund for Dalkon Shield victims.
   The U.S. Supreme Court, in a related action Monday, let stand a
ruling against a $15 million emergency fund to help women who
became infertile from using the intrauterine device, which Robins
sold in the early 1970s. The Supreme Court also refused to review a
ruling that placed on hold several lawsuits against the insurer of
the IUD.
   Robins has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since
August 1985. The Richmond-based maker of pharmaceuticals sought
court protection from creditors as lawsuits mounted against the
birth control device.
   Joseph F. McDowell III, a Manchester, N.H., attorney for 35
users of the IUD, told Merhige and Shelley the disclosure statement
should not go out because it appeared to give a discharge from
liability to not only Robins but to its insurer, corporate
directors and members of the Robins' family.
   Attorneys for Robins and the Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. that
insured the Dalkon Shield said claimants voting to ratify the
reorganization plan are not prevented from subsequently going to
court. McDowell's objection was overruled.
   An attorney for the Internal Revenue Service challenged an
arrangement for Robins to repay the federal tax agency's priority
claim over a six-year period.
   ``We're being asked to make a $62 million unsecured loan at
prime interest,'' said Stuart Gibson, an IRS tax lawyer.
   Merhige, however, overruled the objection. ``It's your own
fault,'' the judge told Gibson. ``I asked you to settle it ... and
you couldn't do it.''
   In Washington, the Supreme Court upheld the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals' decision to reject the $15 million emergency
fund, which Merhige had approved as a means of helping women still
of child-bearing age to regain fertility through special surgery.
   The emergency fund was challenged by Robins' stockholders as
giving preferential treatment to a select group of claims while the
final reorganization was pending.
   The high court's decision not to review the stay of lawsuits
against Aetna upheld Merhige and the 4th Circuit. The appeals court
said the suits brought by women in Kansas and New Hampshire
inevitably would pull in Robins and thus would detract from the
ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.

   Ford Motor Co. said it will begin exporting its
Lincoln Continental and Mercury Sable cars this spring to South
Korea, where they will sell for about three times their U.S. prices.
   South Korea dropped a ban on car imports last year, but tariffs,
taxes and fees remain in place.
   Ford said Monday that the Continentals and Sables will sell in
South Korea for about $42,000 and $75,000, respectively. In the
United States, Sables sell for about $14,000 to $16,000 while
Continentals fetch between $25,000 and $30,000 per car.
   General Motors Corp. also has begun a small-scale program to
ship luxury cars to South Korea. GM said its Buicks and Cadillacs
also will sell for about three times their U.S. prices.

<HEAD>Will Third Try Be Lucky For Casinos In Detroit?
^LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once again, Detroit is asking itself whether the
neon glare of a colony of gambling casinos can attract cash and
jobs to a city short on both.
   Voters in the nation's sixth-largest city rejected casino
gambling in 1976 and 1981 by margins of 3-to-2 in advisory votes.
This time, a battalion of civic leaders is studying the issue at
the behest of Mayor Coleman A. Young amid criticism from local
pulpits and unfavorable results of a recent poll.
   A 67-member commission will issue a report on the casino
questions by mid-May. Even a favorable recommendation would have to
be followed by another city-wide referendum and approval by the
Michigan Legislature and Gov. James Blanchard.
   Following Young's lead, most members of the Detroit Casino
Gaming Commission have taken a carefully noncommittal public stance
on the issue.
   ``I don't know if casino gambling is good for Detroit,'' said
co-chairman Samuel Gardner, former chief judge of Detroit
Recorder's Court. ``I never really sat down and concentrated on it.
I can think of good things and bad things. But I don't have all the
facts.''
   To Young, the vagaries of Detroit's manufacturing economy
justify another look at casino gambling. Unemployment, which has
risen and fallen with the uneven fortunes of the auto industry,
peaked at more than 20 percent in the mid-1970s and averaged about
11.5 percent in 1987, more than 3 percentage points higher than the
statewide rate.
   While auto sales have recently shown some improvement, the
industry is struggling to protect jobs these days, not create them.
   ``I don't think it's a panacea to all our problems,'' Young said
in announcing the casino study. ``By the same token, I don't
believe that any enterprise that offers the prospect of 50,000 jobs
can be cavalierly dismissed, especially without an in-depth
examination.''
   Other than citing 50,000 potential construction and casino jobs,
Young has been reserved about who would develop the facilities or
where they would be located. Specifics have come from real estate
developer Patrick Meehan, who for several years has proposed
developing as many as 12 casinos on Belle Isle, an island park in
the Detroit River. Meehan, however, has been excluded from the
commission and has been criticized by Young for acting without
proper authority.
   ``Will it be the major industry in Detroit? Absolutely not,''
said commission co-chairman Frank Stella, a suburban business
executive. ``In London it isn't; in Puerto Rico and Vienna it's
not. If it's going to be here, it's going to help create jobs'' and
augment the local tourism and convention trade, he said.
   ``This might create some jobs. Jobs to chauffeur people, be a
bodyguard or shuffling chips,'' said a critic Ralph Slovenko, a
professor of law and psychiatry at Wayne State University in
Detroit.
   Casinos have provided thousands of jobs and millions of dollars
of revenue for New Jersey since they were legalized in Atlantic
City. But James W. Hughes, chairman of the Urban Planning and
Policy Department at Rutgers University, said casinos have
fulfilled their darker prophecies, too.
   Hughes, who coauthored a 1983 book, ``The Atlantic City
Gamble,'' said the jobs created have been mostly menial employment.
Higher positions have been filled with outsiders, including
experienced Nevada dealers, and workers skimmed from other fields,
such as nurses whose interpersonal skills qualified them for jobs
as dealers.
   Slovenko also was unimpressed by the potential property tax base
created by multimillion-dollar casinos, saying, ``Everything that's
coming into the city has got so many (tax) abatements, they end up
hardly paying anything.''
   ``You're potentially creating a monster with limited economic
benefits, unless it's really tightly linked to hotels and downtown
convention facilities ... as an ancillary device,'' Hughes said in
a telephone interview from New Brunswick, N.J.
   Other critics have accused Young of stacking the commission with
casino supporters, although Stella estimated that backers and
opponents each comprise about 10 percent of its membership and the
rest, including himself, are undecided.
   Casino opponents, led by Detroit accountant Thomas Barrow, who
unsuccessfully challenged Young in the 1985 mayoral election,
collected enough signatures to place a casino referendum on the
Aug. 2 primary ballot. Results of one poll and the potential
influence of hundreds of preachers appear to point toward defeat of
the issue.
   A statewide telephone survey of 350 residents, conducted
recently for the Detroit Free Press, showed 53 percent opposed to
casino gambling in Detroit and 39 percent in favor, with the rest
undecided or having no opinion.
   A coalition of Protestant clergy has pledged to rally support
against the casino proposal.
   ``There is power in the word, and the word as we understand it
is that casino gambling is in opposition to the will of God,'' the
Rev. John Peoples, a City Council member and co-chairman of the
coalition, told the Free Press.
   Gov. Blanchard has expressed skepticism about casinos' benefits
but said he would keep an open mind while awaiting the commission's
findings.
   Young, despite proclaiming objectivity and pledging to abide by
the commission's recommendations, said in announcing the study that
the odds on casino gambling might be narrowing.
   ``I don't think Detroiters ever had a serious discussion in
which the facts were presented'' prior to the 1976 and 1981
referenda, he said. ``I think Detroiters voted in full ignorance
the previous two times.''

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf with early trading today, SUBS

<TEXT>
   The recent surge in oil prices ground to a halt
when the markets got word of Saudi King Fahd's latest statements on
the current state of prices and crude production.
   Fahd suggested in a statement issued Monday that cheating on
quotas and prices by some members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries encouraged further weakness in prices.
   That sent prices into full reverse on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where contracts for April delivery of West Texas
Intemediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, gave up an early 45-cent
gain to close at $16.49 per barrel, down 9 cents from Friday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating
oil closed up 0.35 cent at 45.40 cents per gallon, after having
risen to 46.70 cents per gallon earlier. Unleaded gasoline gave up
a 1.41-cent gain to close up 0.12 cent at 46.11 cents a gallon.
   The decline continued in early trading today. West Texas
Intermediate was down 28 cents to $16.11 a barrel, while heating
oil was off 0.05 cent to 43.35 cents a gallon and gasoline fell
0.51 cent to 45.60 cents a gallon.
   ``The basic factor in balancing supply and demand is the
commitment of all member states to OPEC-decreed quotas and prices.
But if one member fails to live up to this commitment, then the
result will affect the market. This is what we witness presently,''
the official Saudi news agency quoted Fahd as saying.
   ``Under these circumstances, it would be difficult to ask those
committed (to OPEC output and price controls) to modify the
situation at the expense of their quotas,'' the king said.
   Analysts said Saudi Arabia is believed to have been discounting
its oil lately, and that some traders interpreted Fahd's remarks as
justifying that action.
   As such, it undermined a recent rally by reiterating the
kingdom's well-known postition that it would not sacrifice its own
production or prices to bolster the market while other cartel
members continue to cheat.
   Prices, which had been sagging, rose strongly after OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said last
Thursday he would announce new measures to bring stability to the
market at a press conference today.
   However, a source close to Lukman said today that the press
conference was expected to focus on Nigeria's domestic oil policy,
although questions on OPEC might be raised by reporters.
   In addition, a spokesman for the state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. said the press conference, although originally
scheduled for today, was more likely to take place Wednesday or
Thursday.
   Lukman's announcement last Thursday came one day after he
declared he would not seek an early meeting of OPEC ministers,
despite a weeks-long trend of eroding prices at the time.
   Thus, many analysts said Monday they were not certain what
measures Lukman could announce that could have any substantive
effect on prices.
   ``Most people don't believe he's got anything new to tell the
world,'' said Donald Morton, vice president for energy futures in
the Boston office of Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc.
   James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc. Commodities, said he
believed there were fears prices would drop sharply, once
disappointment over Lukman's comments set into the market _ and
that the Saudi king had thus stepped in to soften the blow.
   ``I think that's why Fahd made the statement today,'' Steel said.

   Stocks turned mixed today, strengthened by
higher bond prices and takeover-related buying, but restrained by
investor reluctance to participate in a market still suffering
post-crash uncertainty.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.49 points to
2,065.65 by noon on Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange's
composite index of all listed issues was unchanged at 151.47. The
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.16 to 298.34.
   Gaining and losing issues were about even on the NYSE, with 636
up, 645 down and 520 unchanged. Volume totaled 65.3 million shares
in the morning session, compared with 65.76 million Monday morning.
   Rising prices in the bond market provided some optimism to Wall
Street because they dampened anxiety over inflation and higher
interest rates. Bonds were buoyed by lower oil prices and a
government report that showed a surprising drop in factory orders
for durable goods in February.
   Some stocks also were boosted by rumored and actual takeovers,
reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past
several weeks.
   Nevertheless, stockbrokers said the relatively low volume of
trading and the lack of any significant economic signals showed
that many investors remain reluctant to re-enter the market in the
aftermath of the October crash.
   ``People still are wounded,'' said Philip C. Puccio, manager of
institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co. ``Those wounds have not
scarred over yet. There's fear we could be looking at another
downdraft.''
   Lucky Stores was the most active issue, jumping 14] to 46| in
heavy trading after rival chain American Stores announced a
$45-a-share tender offer for the company.
   Kansas City Southern, target of a $60-a-share takeover attempt
by a New York investor group, advanced 2\ to 57\. On the Amex,
Resorts International Class A shares rose 3 to 31| after
entertainer Merv Griffin boosted his offer for the company in a
takeover battle with developer Donald Trump.

<HEAD>High Court Rejects IRS Attempt to Impose Stiffer Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected the Internal
Revenue Service's attempt to impose stiffer taxes when individuals
or business partnerships form corporations to obtain financing.
   By an 8-0 vote, the court said real estate developers in
Kentucky should not be subjected to a heavier tax burden because
they formed corporations for the sole purpose of borrowing money.
   Jesse C. Bollinger, either individually or in partnership with
others, developed eight apartment complexes in the Lexington, Ky.,
area beginning in 1968.
   To obtain construction-financing loans, Bollinger formed
corporations to borrow the money at 8 percent interest. Kentucky's
usury law at the time limited the interest non-corporate borrowers
could be charged to 7 percent, and lenders were not willing to
finance Bollinger's projects at that rate.
   When Bollinger and his partners sought to claim business losses
connected with the apartment projects on their individual federal
income taxes, the IRS disallowed it.
   The tax agency said the losses must be attributed to the
corporations, deemed to be the true owners of the apartment
complexes. That designation worked to the tax disadvantage of
Bollinger and his partners.
   A federal appeals court ruled against the IRS, and today's
decision upheld that ruling.
   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said the
corporations had been formed for a legitimate, non-manipulative
purpose.
   ``It seems to us that ... tax-avoiding manipulation (is)
adequately avoided when ... the corporation is acting as agent for
its shareholders with respect to a particular asset (the apartment
complexes) is set forth in a written agreement at the time the
asset is acquired,'' Scalia said.
   He also noted that the corporations at issue in this case
functioned ``as agent and not principal with respect to the asset
for all purposes, and the corporation is held out as the agent and
not principal in all dealings with third parties relating to the
asset.''
   The case is Commissioner, IRS vs. Bollinger, 86-1672.

<HEAD>De Benedetti Wins 3.53 Percent More of Societe Generale in Public
Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian investor Carlo De Benedetti has
increased his holdings in Societe Generale de Belgique SA by 3.53
percent, but it was not known if his alliance held a majority stake
in Belgium's largest holding company, officials said Tuesday.
   An official at De Benedetti's French investment company Cerus
SA, who asked not to be named, did not know whether the public
offer gave De Benedetti and his allies control of the company.
   This alliance claimed to control 47.01 percent of Societe
Generale's shares before Tuesday. The newly purchased shares would
apparently raise this to 50.54 percent. But the Cerus official said
the 47.01 percent might have included some shares from the public
offer.
   On March 10, a Franco-Belgian alliance opposing De Benedetti
claimed to control 50.7 percent of Societe Generale.
   Tuesday's announcement was the latest twist in one of Europe's
biggest and most complex takeover battles. It failed to provide
definite clues about the outcome, more than two months after De
Benedetti first announced his bid for 166-year-old Societe Generale.
   On March 10, De Benedetti called for shareholders meeting, which
should make it clear which side has a majority. The meeting is set
for April 14.
   Meanwhile, a court case was still pending on a Societe Generale
capital increase to fend off De Benedetti. The ruling in that case
might still dramatically change the stakes each side claims to hold.
   Cerus, the investment firm through which De Benedetti was vying
for control of Societe Generale, said Tuesday it had obtained 1.087
million additional shares, or 3.53 percent of the company's total
share capital, including warrants.
   Cerus launched a public offer for the extra shares on Feb. 15.
The bid was to have expired March 4 but has since been extended.
   The offer was designed to acquire 2.1 million shares, or about 7
percent of the share capital of Societe Generale.
   Cerus offered 8,000 francs, or $228, for ordinary shares in the
last stage of its public offer.
   Reacting to Tuesday's announcement, the management of Societe
Generale, which opposes De Benedetti, said there were no defections
from the Franco-Belgian alliance to Cerus' camp.
   De Benedetti wants to turn Societe Generale into the platform of
a pan-European holding company while the Franco-Belgian group wants
to keep the company firmly entrenched in the Belgian economic
fabric.
   On Tuesday, Societe Generale announced its net profit in 1987
fell 22.1 percent to stand at 4.138 billion francs. Societe
Generale has a stake in over 1,200 companies world-wide and the
government has stressed the company is vital for its investment
strategy, technological development and its relations with its
former colony Zaire.
   The De Benedetti group consists of Cerus, the U.S. investment
bank Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the Swiss bank Companie de Banque
et d'Investissements and the food giant Nestle SA, two Belgian
partners and several smaller allies.
   The Franco-Belgian alliance is anchored around the French
investment firm Companie Financiere de Suez and Belgium's biggest
insurer, Groupe AG SA and includes several other partners.

<HEAD>Jurors Award $7.95 Million in Delta Crash Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury has awarded a record $7.95
million to the estate of an IBM executive and his wife killed in a
Delta Air Lines crash outside Dallas, including more than $6
million for his lost potential earnings at the computer company.
   The jury at U.S. District Court in Manhattan deliberated just
five hours before returning its verdict at 8:30 p.m. Monday in the
suit by the estate of Philip D. Estridge, 47, of New Canaan, Conn.,
and his wife Mary Ann.
   Estridge, who received much of the credit for moving IBM into
the personal computer market, and his wife were among 137 people
killed when the Lockheed L-1011 crashed on approach at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport on Aug. 2, 1985.
   ``I thought it would have been more, and it should have been
more,'' said attorney Lee Kreindler, who had asked for $25 million
for Estridge and $5 million for his wife. ``I was a little
disappointed with the numbers.''
   But Evelyn Eubanks, one of three daughters who filed the suit,
said they were happy with the judgment and the end of the case.
   ``We don't think anything could have happened any better and
we're definitely relieved it's over,'' she said. ``It doesn't make
it better, but it helps us to live with it.''
   Kreindler said the sum awarded Monday was a record for
compensatory damages in a wrongful-death suit. The breakdown was
$6.25 million for Estridge's loss of earnings, $750,000 for loss of
enjoyment of life and $100,000 for mental anguish.
   For Mrs. Estridge, the jury awarded $750,000 for loss of
enjoyment of life and $100,000 for mental anguish.
   Shortly before Estridge died, the Jacksonville, Fla., native was
named overseer of IBM's worldwide manufacturing operations, based
in New York, at a salary of $240,000 yearly.
   Although the trial was held in New York City, the award was
reached under the law of Estridge's new home state of Connecticut
to allow for the salary projection figures, Kreindler said.
   Delta lawyer John Sabetta declined to comment on the award, but
told Judge John E. Sprizzo he would appeal. Delta spokesman Bill
Berry referred all calls to the company's insurance carrier, U.S.
Aviation Underwriters, and had no comment.
   The Estridge verdict came on the same day of opening arguments
in another suit stemming from the fatal crash.
   A wrongful-death suit on behalf of Julie Ann Zarnt of Boca
Raton, Fla., opened Monday with a 12-minute videotape highlighting
her 15 years of life.
   The first half of the tape was made from silent home movies. It
showed her as a newborn first coming home and as a toddler
celebrating birthdays and Christmas.

   In the stock market, the names, numbers and
skills of the players change but the game remains about the same no
matter how many times we are told that ``it's a whole new ball
game.''
   Never was that advice more freely offered, more uncritically
accepted and more avariciously followed than in the stock market of
1987, which crashed to reality on Oct. 19.
   It is, by popular agreement, the BIG lesson emerging bit by bit
as the event recedes into history, and as once giddy and greedy
minds resume more sober interpretations of the economy.
   The various studies under way or completed seem to emphasize
such factors as ``portfolio insurance'' and futures trading and
other technical factors that arose over the past decade and
seemingly changed the market's makeup.
   No doubt, such factors could have contributed, but it is now
patently clear they couldn't have done so without the presence of
the same old psychological undercurrent that boosted stock prices
beyond reason.
   The omens were there to absorb or ignore:
   Shares sold at 22 times earnings, vs. a long-time norm under 15.
They were priced at 2{ to 3 times a company's liquidation value, a
full point above the long-term norm. Dividend yields were half what
they should have been.
   Critics with a classic education in the ways of the stock market
pointed to these lessons, and more, and were scorned as
old-fashioned. Who were they to argue with sophisticated electronic
computations? Do computers lie?
   The oldtimers' admonitions have left an eerie echo, a painful
one, somewhat akin to parental warnings that were ignored because,
every child knows, parents issue warnings to children because
that's what parents are supposed to do.
   Looking back, some of the market's smartest investors, including
big-name portfolio managers for mutual funds, insurers and the
like, wonder how they got drawn into a market they knew was headed
for a fall.
   They knew, but apparently couldn't resist the temptation of what
they thought was easy money, just as others before them fell
because they were governed by emotions peculiar to the human
species.
   It is still a debate with some of them as they review the crash.
They knew the old rules still applied. They knew the market was
destined to correct its imbalance _ that is, fall. They knew the
rules of the game hadn't changed.
   But, they ask, was it reason or emotion that governed their
decision to jump in? Was it unreasonable to assume that a market
propelled ever higher, no matter how irrationally, offered an
opportunity to make a quick buck?
   Was it reasonable or foolish to ignore the stories of quick
profits by your brother-in-law and not be tempted to do the same?
Or, for a fund manager, was it foolhardy or sensible to try keeping
pace with dice-throwing competitors?
   You can blame the crash on new trading techniques, the
acceleration of trading activity by means of computers, and the
instantaneous communications that seem to exaggerate advances and
declines.
   Something might be done eventually to mute the adverse effects
of these factors, but judging from the evidence of last fall there
is little that can be done with the players themselves.
   The names and numbers change, and some of the techniques, too,
but the game will always be played by human beings, and they can be
expected to act no differently.

   Digital Equipment Corp. says it has signed the
nation's biggest explosives company as a customer because it can
give ``more bang for the buck'' than International Business
Machines Corp.
   Digital said Tuesday it sold Atlas Powder Co. a Vax 8700 for its
Dallas headquarters and three MicroVax systems for production
facilities in Joplin, Mo.; Tamaqua, Pa.; and Frankfort, Ky.
   The contract is for between $2 million and $3 million, including
related data-storage devices, according to Darwin Wolfe, the
company's director of information services.
   Atlas, a subsidiary of Dallas-based Tyler Corp., is switching
from IBM.

   Shareholders attending what could be
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.'s last annual meeting Tuesday voted to
shorten the company's name but had little to say about Bridgestone
Corp.'s bid for the tire maker.
   About 900 people attended the half-hour meeting, where
shareholders voted to change the company's name to Firestone, Inc.
   Shareholders asked only two questions about Bridgestone's offer
to pay $80 a share, or $2.6 billion, for Firestone's outstanding
shares. Stockholders will meet again April 25 to vote on the tender
offer.
   Bridgestone's bid, which was accepted by Firestone's board,
exceeds a $1.86 billion offer from Italian tire maker Pirelli S.p.A.
   After the meeting, Firestone Chairman John J. Nevin met briefly
with reporters and discussed Firestone's talks with Bridgestone and
Pirelli. Firestone and Bridgestone had planned a 75 percent joint
venture until Pirelli made its unsolicited, $58-a-share bid for all
of Firestone's 32 million outstanding shares.
   Nevin said he told both Bridgestone and Pirelli in negotiations
that Firestone was holding talks with a third firm that he declined
to identify.
   Nevin speculated that Bridgestone was able to make its tender
offer quickly because of its prior knowledge of Firestone.
Bridgestone purchased a plant from Firestone in 1983.
   ``I don't want to speculate on what Bridgestone would have done
under other circumstances. But I think all of the background that
Bridgestone had acquired in discussions with us earlier certainly
made it much more possible for Bridgestone to move quickly in a
two-week period,'' said Nevin.
   ``I think that had we announced in mid-February that the board
of directors had decided to enter into a joint venture with Pirelli
rather than Bridgestone, I think it was improbable that Bridgestone
then would have made an unsolicited tender offer ... This was by no
means an unfriendly action on Bridgestone's part,'' Nevin said.
   He reiterated that he has no plans to buy back from Bridgestone
any of Firestone's non-tire businesses, including its 1,500
MasterCare car repair operations.

   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman postponed
indefinitely a scheduled news conference that was expected to have
focused on stabilizing sagging oil prices, the Guardian newspaper
said.
   Last week Nigerian petroleum ministry officials said Lukman
would announce Tuesday new measures to bring stability to the
market.
   But the ministry said the news conference had been called off,
according to the newspaper. No new date was given.
   Lukman has accused the Western news media of trying to
destabilize the oil market to bring down prices, adding OPEC would
not be driven into taking emergency measures to stop the fall of
oil prices.
   He also has vowed the cartel would stand firm on its decision to
produce 15.60 million barrels of oil a day. A barrel of oil is
equivalent to 42 gallons.

   Stocks were mixed today in another slow trading
session that brokers attributed to underlying investor reluctance
to participate because of post-crash uncertainty.
   ``We're right on the top of the fence and don't know which way
we're going to fall,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager of
over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, confined to a
narrow range through most of the session, was up 3.15 points to
2,070.29 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange's
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.25 to 151.72. The
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.75 to 298.93.
   Gaining issues narrowly led declines on the NYSE, with 768 up,
648 down and 511 unchanged. Volume totaled a sluggish 97.84 million
shares with two hours of business left.
   Stocks were helped somewhat by a surprising drop in factory
orders for durable goods in February. The report by the Commerce
Department suggested to some strategists that the economy isn't as
strong as previously believed, thereby raising the possibility that
interest rates won't creep up.
   Some stocks also were boosted by rumored and actual takeovers,
reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past
several weeks.
   Nevertheless, stockbrokers said the relatively low volume of
trading and the lack of any significant economic signals showed
that many investors remain reluctant to re-enter the market in the
aftermath of the October crash.
   ``People still are wounded,'' said Philip C. Puccio, manager of
institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co. ``Those wounds have not
scarred over yet. There's fear we could be looking at another
downdraft.''
   Lucky Stores was the most active NYSE issue, jumping 14[ to 46]
in heavy trading after rival chain American Stores announced a
$45-a-share tender offer for the company.
   Speculation about a possible takeover also affected grocery
chain Kroger, which rose 1| to 36[. Speculative buying affected a
range of other companies including Pillsbury, up 1[ to 36[; USG, up
2} to 37|; and Himont, up 3\ to 44\.
   On the Amex, Resorts International Class A shares rose 3| to 32\
after entertainer Merv Griffin boosted his offer for the company in
a takeover battle with developer Donald Trump.

   Share prices closed narrowly mixed Tuesday on the
London Stock Exchange, with many stocks depressed by continued thin
trading in the opening days of an extended trading account period.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 5.7
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,835.4 at the close, its worst level
for the day.
   Volume was barely changed at 357.1 million shares, compared with
357.3 million on Monday.
   Shares opened lower following a sharp decline on Wall Street on
Monday, and an attempted rally in mid-morning quickly ran out of
steam. A feeble opening in New York on Tuesday further dampened
sentiment in London afternoon trading.
   Dealers said there was little institutional business as many
investors kept to the sidelines in the early days of the extended
trading account, which runs for three weeks instead of the usual
two to include the Easter holiday weekend. The account began last
Friday afternoon.
   The London exchange divides trading into either two-week or
three-week periods for accounting purposes. Trades generally must
be completed within 10 days of a period ending.

<HEAD>Says It Will Accept Rulings on Fish and Liquor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada said Monday it will accept two rulings of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by lowering
protectionist barriers on wine and liquor and Pacific Coast fish
processing.
   Trade Minister Pat Carney told the House of Commons in Ottawa
that Canadians would be ``exposed to the law of the jungle'' in
world commerce if the government did not support the rulings,
scheduled for ratification Tuesday by the full council of GATT,
which is based in Geneva.
   Canada had the option of fighting or ignoring the rulings by the
95-nation GATT, which sets international trade rules and
adjudicates disputes between members. But that course could have
led to retaliation, such as duties on Canadian goods.
   A preliminary GATT ruling last fall said Canada's
province-by-province system of marketing alcoholic beverages
unfairly favors domestic wine, beer and liquor.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The GATT panel was assessing a longstanding complaint against
Canadian liquor boards by the 12-nation European Community, which
wants to sell more wine and brandy in Canada.
   Carney said Canada will open borders to more foreign wine and
liquor, as the GATT asked, but protection will continue for the
$3.4 billion Canadian beer industry.
   Canadian wines, mostly of low quality, have a 45 percent share
of the domestic market because of a government policy limiting
imports. Ontario Province puts a 66 percent surcharge on foreign
wines.
   The Europeans do not plan large-scale beer exports, although
beer was included in their complaint. But if Canada dropped its
import barriers for beer, the path would be cleared for the major
U.S. breweries to swamp the Canadian market.
   At present, Canadian provinces only permit the sale of beer
brewed within each province by the nation's 40 breweries, with a
few foreign imports. U.S. beers are brewed in Canada under license.
   The Brewers Association of Canada warned last week that 19,000
Canadian jobs would be lost if the American beer companies moved in.
   Carney said the government is reviewing a petition by Canada's
33 wineries to launch a GATT challenge to the heavy subsidies
enjoyed by European Economic Community vineyards. In the meantime,
the government will consider adjustment programs for Canadian wine
growers and winemakers, she said.

<TEXT>
   On West Coast fish, the GATT preliminary ruling condemned Canada
for curbs on the export of raw salmon and herring. The fish is
currently processed in British Columbia before shipment, raising
its price and discriminating against U.S. fish processing companies.
   Carney said the government would accept the GATT ruling but will
introduce new measures to force Canadian fishermen to land their
catch in British Columbia. Some are now selling salmon or herring
off their boats to U.S. fish companies.

   The dollar ended slightly higher against most
major foreign currencies in European trading Tuesday. Gold prices
fell.
   Most of the day's activity occurred in cross trades that did not
involve the dollar. The pound and the yen gained against the West
German mark, while the French franc steadied against the mark on
expectations that President Francois Mitterand would announce that
he will run in next month's election.
   With attention focused elsewhere, ``nobody is too sure what to
do with the dollar,'' said Keith Dipple, chief trader at Banque
Francaise du Commerce Exterieur in London.
   Dealers said the yen remains strong because of expectations that
Japanese financial institutions will buy the currency at the end of
the Japanese fiscal year.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 127.07 yen, down 1.28 yen from last Friday. The
Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday on Monday.
   Later in London, the dollar was quoted higher at 127.10 yen.
   In London, it cost $1.8300 to buy one pound, more expensive than
$1.8285 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.6935 West German marks, up from 1.6880; 1.4015 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3970; 5.7540 French francs, up from 5.7380;
1.9015 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8970; 1,253.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,249.25, and 1.2468 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2494.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $448.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $449.50. In Zurich, gold also was
lower, closing at a bid $448.50 down from $450.50 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.61 an ounce to close at a
bid $451.87.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.46 a troy ounce, compared
with Monday's $6.47.

   Brokers said the market also received a boost by sharp increases
in borrowed shares sold on the NYSE and Amex in the month ended

   Wheat and soybean futures prices ended higher
while corn futures slipped slightly Tuesday at the Chicago Board of

   The November-delivery contract for soybeans rose 7 cents to a

   Wheat futures were supported by notions that India, still
suffering the effects of a recent drought, would be offered a
substantial amount of U.S. wheat under the Agriculture Department's

   Corn prices, however, were pressured by news that Vermont Sen.

<TEXT>
   There is no evidence G.D. Searle and Co.
withheld information from the Food and Drug Administration in
winning approval for its Copper-7 intrauterine contraceptive
device, an FDA spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   FDA officials met with Searle representatives last week to
discuss whether company documents recently unsealed in a Minnesota
court case challenging the IUD were available to the government
agency before it approved the device in 1974.
   ``The gist of our initial review is that we've had that
information all along, and that we got it when we initially began
reviewing'' Searle's application for approval of the IUD, said
spokewoman Susan Cruzan.
   ``There's no evidence they didn't give us all the necessary
inforatmion when we began our review,'' she said.
   The Searle IUD remains on the government approved list, but the
company stopped selling it in 1986, citing growing costs from court
suits.
   The company faces about 500 suits by women who claim that the
Copper-7 caused them to develop pelvic infections. The company has
won 14 of the 17 suits that have gone to trial and maintains that
the device was, and is, safe.

   The dollar finished mixed in dull trading
Tuesday as buyers focused their attention on other major currencies.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a bid price for gold of $448.65 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down
from Monday's late bid of $449.45.
   Currency dealers said the dollar traded in a narrow range in
lackluster activity. ``There was a lot of activity but no results _
the dollar didn't go anywhere,'' said Robert Ryan, a senior trader
at Irving Trust Co.
   As the dollar languished, investors turned to other currencies,
namely the Japanese yen. ``People seem to be buying yen against
mostly anything else these days,'' said Lou Calvello, a
foreign-exchange trader with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Dealers both at home and in Europe said Japanese financial
institutions are likely to continue to buy yen as the Japanese
fiscal year draws to a close on March 31.
   ``It will be interesting to see where the Japanese money will go
after the end of their tax year,'' Ryan said.
   In European dealings, the dollar finished slightly higher
against most major currencies, but most of the day's activity
occurred in trades in other currencies.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 127.07 yen, down 1.28 yen from last Friday. The
Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday on Monday.
   Later, in London, the dollar was quoted higher at 127.10 yen. In
New York, the dollar closed at 127.02 yen, up from 126.92 on Monday.
   In London, it cost $1.8300 to buy one pound, more expensive than
$1.8285 late Monday. Later, in New York, it cost $1.8330 to buy one

<HEAD>First RepublicBank Breakup Considered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ailing First RepublicBank Corp. might have to be
split into pieces to make Texas' largest bank-holding company more
attractive to investors, experts said.
   First RepublicBank, weakened by a run on deposits and
multimillion-dollar losses, received a $1 billion injection of
capital from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last week.
   But because it could take as much as $5 billion to rescue the
nation's 13th-largest bank holding company, banking regulators are
considering breaking up the holding company as a marketing
alternative.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said, ``that certainly is an
option.''
   The holding company's banks in major markets could be packaged
together or in regional or in statewide combinations, experts said.
   ``The first thing you think of is splitting the company into
bite-size morsels,'' said James Sexton, a former director of
supervision at the FDIC who is a consultant at Bracewell &
Patterson, an Austin, Texas law firm.
   ``It's a very large bank for someone else to acquire,'' said
Tanya Azarchs, a banking analyst with Standard & Poor's Corp. in
New York. ``I don't see anyone on the scene that's willing to do
that.''
   First Republic reported a 1987 loss of $656.8 million, $3.92
billion in problem assets and had deposit outflows of more than $2
billion this year. Assets total about $33.2 billion.
   The bank holding company, however, is in the process of
consolidating some of its banks, which could make a breakup more
difficult. Those moves already have cut the number of banks from
103 to 73, and plans are to continue mergings until only 40 remain.
   The holding company has banks in Dallas, Austin, Houston and San
Antonio.
   Although the breakup of the holding company could make it more
accessible to investors, some argue it would be better if the
company remained intact.
   ``These banks are intertwined, having common management,
borrowers and computer systems,'' Sexton said. ``Breaking off
chunks presents some tough administrative problems.''

   The stock market languished Tuesday and finished
narrowly mixed, reflecting what brokers called widespread investor
apathy despite another rash of takeover-related buying that boosted
some issues.
   Economic uncertainty and resilient anxiety about the market's
condition five months after the October crash generally were blamed
for another slow trading day.
   ``There is absolutely no interest in the broad section of stocks
with the exception of takeover targets,'' said John J. Muldowney,
manager of equity and over-the-counter trading at Scott &
Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va. ``I think that overall, there is
a belief that maybe this thing's not over and people are just
taking a wait-and-see attitude.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 20.23 points
Monday in the slowest trading of the year, vacillated in a tight
range and ended down 0.99 point to 2,066.15. Most broader market
indicators rose marginally.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 142.0 million
shares, slightly more than the 1987 low of 128.83 million shares
traded Monday.
   In another similarity to the previous session, the stock market
mirrored the behavior of the bond market, a sensitive barometer of
the economy's health. Bond prices finished barely changed,
reflecting uncertainty over whether interest rates will rise, drop
or stabilize.
   ``We're right on the top of the fence and don't know which way
we're going to fall,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager of
over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York. ``It's very slow. The only thing good is that when the
market's down, volume dries up. That indicates there's not much
selling.''
   The number of advancing stocks narrowly outnumbered declines in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with 765 up, 736
down and 481 unchanged.
   As with the previous session, the big winners were rumored and
actual takeover targets, led by Lucky Stores, which jumped 14{ to
46} in heavy trading after American Stores offered $45 a share for
the supermarket company. American Stores fell 2| to 57~.
   Federated Department Stores rose 2] to 69\ after Canadian
developer Campeau raised its offer for the retailer. Other
prominent speculative takeover-related stocks included Pillsbury,
up 1{ to 45}, and Kroger, up 1{ to 36.
   Resorts International gained 3| to 32\ after entertainer Merv
Griffin raised his offer for the casino company to $35 a share in a
takeover battle with New York real estate developer Donald Trump.
   Among the blue chips, Merck rose 2\ to 160{, IBM fell | to 113[,
Primerica rose } to 31] and Exxon fell | to 43{.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 170.57 million shares.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, which measures the
value of all U.S. stocks, rose $2.03 billion or 0.08 percent to
$2.663 trillion.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues rose 0.05 to
151.52.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 0.02 to 312.02,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.10 to 268.84.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.62
to 298.80. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market rose 1.19 to 379.76.

<HEAD>Platinum Sugres for Second Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum future prices surged a second straight day Tuesday at
the New York Mercantile Exchange as a ``whiff of inflation'' and
uneasiness about South Africa rippled through the markets.
   Platinum broke through a barrier at $510 a troy ounce, climbing
$7.70 to $8.30 higher with the contract for March delivery settling
at $510.40.
   On other markets, petroleum futures prices finished mostly
higher in volatile trading; wheat and soybean futures prices were
higher, but corn slipped slightly; and livestock and meat futures
prices were higher across the board.
   ``Platinum is a good indicator of inflationary sentiment,
because it's a precious metal and an industrial metal,'' said Jack
Barbanel, analyst with Gruntal & Co., New York. ``It's a hedge, but
it's also affected by fundamentals.
   ``Some of (Tuesday's) rise is the whiff of inflation some
traders are picking up on. But you can discount $3 or $4 of the $7
(advance) to South Africa,'' he added. ``We're beginning to seem
some political unrest and that makes people nervous.''
   South Africa provides nearly all of the West's platinum, which
has industrial applications as varied as X-ray scanning equipment
and catalytic converters for autos.
   A nationwide strike Monday marking the 28th anniversary of the
Sharpeville Massacre was honored by as many as 90 percent of the
workers in the Indian Ocean city of Port Elizabeth. Similar
protests were staged elsewhere despite increasingly tough
government measures.
   Gold did not join the runup, finishing 50 cents to $1.60 cents
lower with March at $448.70 a troy ounce on the New York Commodity
Exchange; silver was 1.5 cents to 1.8 cents higher, with March at
646.5 cents a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures finished mixed after another volatile day New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Reports that OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman would _ and then
would not _ hold a news conference to unveil price-stabilizing
measures brought wild swings Monday. The same reports pressured
Tuesday's opening and may have sparked a surge at the close.
   ``The same things that played havoc yesterday was responsible
for today's games as well,'' said Nauman Barakat, energy futures
analyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co., New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 40 cents lower to 11 cents
higher, with April at $16.09 per 42-gallon barrel; heating oil was
30 cents to 95 cents higher, with April at 46.26 cents a gallon;
and unleaded gasoline was 21 cents to 47 cents higher, with April
at 46.32 cents a gallon.
   After Tuesday's close of business, the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly distillate report was generally construed as
slightly bearish for crude.
   Support for wheat and soybeans at the Chicago Board of Trade
came soon after the open when Monday's big player, C&D Commodities,
began buying again.
   C&D's buying didn't match Monday's levels _ the Chicago-based
house bought 20 million bushels of beans the previous day, compared
to just 4 million Tuesday. But it did helped trigger buying that
pushed the November contract for soybeans up 7 cents to equal a
contract high at $6.66 a bushel.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in March at $2.99 a bushel; corn was { cent to 1 cent
lower, with March at $2.00{ a bushel; oats were 2{ cent lower to 5
cents higher, with March at $1.95{ a bushel; and soybeans were 2
cents to 8\ cents higher, with March at $6.32 a bushel.
   A strong move toward frozen pork bellies helped both the
livestock and pork complexes advance at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .73 cent higher, with April at
74.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle was .25 cent to .50 cent higher,
with March at at 82.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to
1.38 cents higher, with April at 46.57 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were .23 cent to 1.45 cents higher, with March at
55.45 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures climbed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poors 500
index settled .05 point higher at 270.65. The underlying spot index
advanced .10 point. closing at 268.84.

<HEAD>Gephardt, Dukakis Trade Charges on Trade</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Clears garble in 13th graf, On July; Also moved on general
newswires</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Richard Gephardt charged Tuesday that
Michael Dukakis' support for tough trade legislation is just ``a
political ploy'' that will end after the Michigan caucuses are over.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, said his position on trade
has been consistent, and his staff released quotations from last
year indicating his support for major provisions of a Senate trade
bill.
   ``Who is for a tough trade policy? Who is going to be for a
tough trade policy after Michigan?'' Gephardt asked in a telephone
interview Tuesday. ``The answer is, Dick Gephardt is and will be.
Mike Dukakis hasn't been, isn't and won't be.''
   ``When he is on the East and West Coast, he wants to talk about
free trade. When he's in Michigan, he doesn't,'' Gephardt said.
   Gephardt's tough trade legislation, now in a conference
committee on Capitol Hill, has been the capstone of the Missouri
congressman's platform.
   Monday night, Dukakis endorsed trade legislation sponsored by
Michigan Sen. Donald Riegle, who in turn endorsed Dukakis. Gephardt
quickly accused Dukakis of having a ``battlefield conversion'' on
trade, saying the Riegle bill was the Senate version of the
Gephardt legislation.
   Dukakis and Jesse Jackson are tied for the lead in the polls on
Saturday's Michigan caucuses, with Gephardt a distant third.
Dukakis aides say that may be the reason for Gephardt's attacks.
   On Tuesday, Gephardt stepped up the attack, questioning the
sincerity of Dukakis' support for such legislation.
   ``I think he remains against it. I think it is a political
ploy,'' Gephardt said. ``By what he has done, he is trying to have
it both ways. ... Now that he is in Michigan and we are five days
out from the caucuses, he wants to fool the people of Michigan.''
   Dukakis said in Michigan late Monday that his position hasn't
changed.
   ``He has been a strong opponent of the Gephardt bill from the
begining, but has always been an advocate of leveling the (trade)
playing field,'' said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   Dukakis' staff on Tuesday pointed to quotes from the
Massachusetts governor last year in favor of the Senate bill.
   On July 11, 1987, Dukakis said, ``I think the trade bill which
the Senate approved yesterday says if there is a consistent pattern
of unfair trade practices ... there I think we have to do
something.''
   ``I feel a lot better about the Senate bill'' than the Gephardt
trade legislation, Dukakis said on Aug. 4, 1987.
   Gephardt said Dukakis ``has said in the past you don't need new
legislation. ... He has been profoundly negative about everything I
have said about trade.''
   The congressman, too, provided quotes from Dukakis last year _
quotes he said back up his charge of a flip-flop.
   ``The president today has all the authority he needs to do
something about those unfair trade practices. We do not need more
laws or more amendments,'' Dukakis said at the Aug. 8 debate at
Drake University, according to Gephardt aides.
   In debates in Dallas and Atlanta, Dukakis told Gephardt, ``You
want a law. Dick, I want to act.''
   And earlier this year in Lansing, Mich., Gephardt aides said,
Dukakis said ``We do not need more legislation.''
   The Gephardt amemdment and the Riegle bill do differ, but both
try to strengthen potential retaliation against U.S. trading
partners for unfair practices. In general, the Riegle bill would
target specific industries in foreign countries which engage in
unfair practices. The Gephardt amendment would trigger retaliation
against another country for running a big surplus with this country
in part through unfair practices.
   ``Dukakis has always felt the president has had the authority to
act. The Riegle amendment ... gives the president a better way to
get there, but he can pretty much get there on his own now,''
Dukakis spokesman Dach said.

<HEAD>Loss of $15.2 Million For Fourth Quarter Of '87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allis-Chalmers Corp., a once-mighty industrial
giant that filed for bankruptcy reorganization last June, Tuesday
reported a net loss of $15.2 million, or $1.17 per share, for the
fourth quarter of 1987.
   The loss, on sales of $109.3 million, compared with a loss of
$5.8 million, or 52 cents per share, for the same period of 1986
when sales totaled $116.8 million.
   For the year, Allis-Chalmers reported a total loss of $29.3
million compared with a loss of $8.6 million in 1986. Sales in 1987
declined to $410 million from $510.3 million in 1986.
   Wendell F. Bueche, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the results reflected obligations from years before the company
scaled down by selling off many of its businesses. Once a major
producer of farm machinery, the company later diversified into
production of a wide range of other equipment.
   Bueche said the cost of health care benefits for retired
employees was disproportionate to the company's size, althoughthe
company has implemented a strategy aimed at reducing that expense.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Fall In February, But Economists Unconcerned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Economists stuck by their optimistic predictions for U.S.
manufacturing on Tuesday in spite of a government report that
orders to American factories for ``big-ticket'' durable goods fell
1.8 percent in February.
   In other news, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
fell 0.99 point to 2,066.15; the dollar was mixed against other
major currencies; and bond prices were little changed in light
trading.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _ items
expected to last three or more years _ totaled a seasonally
adjusted $111.4 billion in February, following an identical 1.8
percent January decline.
   It was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable
goods orders have fallen for two consecutive months.
   Economists maintained that manufacturing companies still were
enjoying good business because the weaker dollar has boosted export
demand.
   ``What we have is a two-month hesitation after some big
increases,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Still, analysts said the back-to-back declines showed businesses
were cutting back on orders in the early part of 1988 in an effort
to get control of bulging inventories. Inventories swelled at the
end of 1987 while consumer demand fell.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., noted that
while new orders fell in February, the total backlog of unfilled
orders rose 0.7 percent to $397.1 billion, the 12th consecutive
monthly increase.
   ``This backlog suggests that factories can keep humming along
for a while even though new orders dropped,'' she said.

<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fortune 44 Co. of Boulder is getting out
of the fortune cookie business, saying the slow market for the
cookies could spell problems for the company's future.
   Company officials announced the decision on Monday, citing
continuing losses and sales which have not met expectations.
Fortune 44 believes the lack of sales are due to the limited
market, the infrequent purchase cycle and intense competition in
the low-price end of the fortune cookie market, officials said in a
written statement.
   ``When's the last time you bought fortune cookies?'' said the
company's controller, Mary Lou Schwab. ``We're in the grocery store
business where things have to turn. People buy fortune cookies but
mostly for a special occasion.''
   The company will service existing customers through May, she
said.
   Started in 1983, Fortune 44 employs eight people and offers 20
different varieties of the cookies, including its Wish Biscuits and
Lucky Chan lines.
   Company officials said they have received inquiries from
competitors interested in acquiring its lines and said Fortune 44
is pursuing those inquiries. Management also is seeking an
acquisition or merger candidate and is having ongoing discussions
with two companies, the statement said.
   The company is optimistic it can find a merger or acquisition
that can benefit shareholders, officials said.
   Fortune 44 reported assets totaling nearly $1.2 million last
September; it has 110 shareholders.

<HEAD>High Court Questions Catalog Tax Practices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A department store chain's attempt to avoid
paying taxes for merchandise catalogs received by its Louisiana
customers sparked skeptical questioning Tuesday in the Supreme
Court.
   Andrew Rinker Jr., representing New Orleans-based D.H. Holmes
Co., seemed to be having little success in arguing that his client
should not have to pay a Louisiana ``use tax'' on the catalogs'
value.
   Rinker spent nearly 30 minutes responding to the justices'
questions. By contrast, Shreveport, La., lawyer Robert G. Pugh
concluded his presentation for state tax officials in less than 10
minutes because he was asked so few questions.
   The court's decision is expected by July.
   Rinker, from New Orleans, contended that no tax should be
assessed because the catalogs are published in other states and
mailed directly to Louisiana residents.
   The state imposes a tax on all tangible personal property bought
or used within Louisiana.
   When Rinker argued that the department store chain actually had
paid for a service _ delivery of the catalogs _ and not for goods,
several justices seemed to disagree.
   ``Holmes put this whole operation into creation,'' said Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor questioned whether delivery of the
catalogs, even through the U.S. mail, is ``an activity that can be
taxed.''
   She later seemed to answer her own question in the affirmative:
``Holmes caused the distribution in Louisiana. It ordered it. It
paid for it.''
   When Rinker contended that it is Holmes' customers, not Holmes,
who use the catalogs, Justice Byron R. White responded, ``Holmes is
having that use provided.''
   When Justice Thurgood Marshall asked, ``Could Holmes have made a
dollar in the state of Louisiana without the catalogs?'' Rinker
said many of the customers who frequent Holmes' 13 stores in
Louisiana did so long before catalogs were mailed out.
   ``Those are pretty old people,'' White quipped.
   Rinker acknowledged that the department store chain could be
subjected to the Louisiana tax if the catalogs are delivered to the
state and distributed from there. But he said the current set-up
precludes state tax liability.
   Pugh argued that the real taxable activity undertaken by Holmes
is ``maintaing a market in Louisiana for their sales.''
   D.H. Holmes Co. also operates stores in Mississippi, Alabama and
Florida but 82 percent of its catalogs are mailed to Louisiana
residents.
   The state tax imposed on Holmes is based on 82 percent of the
catalogs' value, and the validity of applying the tax to the
catalogs was upheld by state courts.
   The case is D.H. Holmes Co. vs. McNamara, 87-267.

   CSX Corp. said Tuesday it has agreed to
sell its oil and natural gas exploration subsidiary to
Houston-based Total Minatome Corp. for $612 million.
   The sale of CSX Oil & Gas Corp. is expected to be completed in
about 30 days, said CSX Chairman Hays T. Watkins in a joint
announcement with Minatome President Jean-Pierre Donnet.
   The CSX subsidiary's principal operations are located in the
United States, mostly along the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana,
and in the North Sea.
   Total Minatome is involved in exploration and production in
Wyoming, Oklahoma, the Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles,
which is based in France.
   The deal will allow Total Minatome a chance to expand its U.S.
and North Sea operations and is in keeping with CSX's plan to
concentrate on its primary transportation, pipeline, property and
technology groups, Donnet and Watkins said.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Agrees to Pay $150,000 Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. and its futures
trading subsidiary agreed to pay a $150,000 fine to settle
administrative charges arising from alleged fraud committed by a
financial consultant in the firm's Dallas office, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said Tuesday.
   The consultant, Charles Dennis Scott of Arlington, Texas, was
charged by the agency with fraud resulting from illegally
allocating trades in cotton futures contracts among his own and his
customers' accounts.
   Merrill Lynch was charged with being liable for Scott's conduct
between December 1980 and August 1982, for failing to properly
supervise him and for failing to keep proper records.
   The firm also was charged with hindering the CFTC investigation
in 1983-84 by failing to promptly provide documents. According to
Dennis Klejna, CFTC enforcement director, the delay amounted to 18
months.
   The firm, its subsidiary and Scott all settled the charges
without admitting or denying them and were ordered to refrain from
future violations.
   Scott agreed to pay a $40,000 fine and accepted a suspension of
his registration for three weeks beginning on Wednesday. He also
agreed to a permanent ban on trading for his own account.
   Klejna said he could not release information on how many
customers were affected or the amount of the alleged fraud.
   Michael Geczi, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch, had no immediate
response to the CFTC announcement.

<HEAD>Black & Decker Withdraws Bid for American Standard</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Precede NEW YORK; RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with Black &

<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Black & Decker Corp. withdrew its $77-a-share
bid for American Standard Inc. Tuesday, halting the bidding war
over the plumbing giant, and allowing a $2.45 billion leveraged
buyout spearheaded by Kelso & Co. to go forward.
   Under the agreement reached Tuesday, the Towson-based tool
manufacturer agreed not to purchase shares of American Standard
until Kelso has had an opportunity to pursue its $78-a-share tender
offer, according to a Black & Decker announcement.
   Under the agreement, Kelso will pay Black & Decker $25 million
for withdrawing its bid, as soon as Kelso begins purchasing stock
under its tender offer or acquires at least 20 percent of American
Standard's shares in any other transaction.
   ``Seventy-seven (dollars) was our top price,'' said Barbara
Lucas, a Black & Decker spokeswoman. Ms. Lucas said Black & Decker
had initially thought Kelso's financing would not come through but
it appeared Kelso would be able to finance the deal.
   A spokeswoman for New York-based American Standard said the
company had no comment on the agreement.
   ``They (Black & Decker) would still be making a deal at $77 if
Kelso-American Standard wasn't able to pull it off,'' said analyst
Cornelius V. Sewell of Argus Research Corp. in New York.
   Sewell said American Standard's transportation products
division, valued at about $600 million, is likely to be sold to pay
off the debt incurred by Kelso to purchase the company.
   American Standard had resisted Black & Decker's takeover
overtures for months, including a sweetened $2.4 billion, or
$77-a-share, offer made last week.
   Instead, American Standard agreed to a $78-a-share leveraged
buyout spearheaded by the New York investment banking firm. Last
week American Standard said its board would recommend Kelso's $2.45
billion offer to shareholders.
   The agreement reached Tuesday, including the $25 million
payment, is conditioned on Black & Decker not renewing its takeover
bid for American Standard.
   If Kelso terminates its merger agreement with American Standard
or fails to purchase shares by May 2, Black & Decker is free to
pursue the acquisition of American Standard, according to Black &
Decker.
   Earlier Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading in
Black & Decker and American Standard shares for three hours in
anticipation of an announcement by Black & Decker.
   NYSE Vice President Richard Torrenzano said at the time that
Black & Decker ``initiated a call'' to the exchange and ``shared
with us information concerning the American Standard bid which
materially could affect the price of their stock.''
   No announcement was forthcoming.
   Both stocks began trading again at 1:43 p.m. EST. After
resumption, American Standard rose 12.5 cents to $77 a share while
Black & Decker was unchanged at $20.125 a share.

   Eight states on Tuesday filed suit accusing
dozens of insurance companies of conspiring to create the liability
insurance crisis, making coverage unavailable or too costly for
many governments and businesses.
   The companies' actions were ``a major contributor to the
insurance crisis that forced so many cities and businesses up
against the wall,'' California Attorney General John Van de Kamp
said at a news conference.
   ``It was the public and the consumer who paid the price for this
collusive exercise in corporate greed,'' he said.
   David Ostwald, a vice president of the Insurance Services
Office, a 1,400-member rate and policy advisory organization named
in the lawsuits, called the claims unfounded and denied the
existence of a conspiracy.
   The lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court here by seven states
accuses major U.S. and British insurance firms, reinsurers and
Ostwald's trade group of using secret agreements and internal
pressure several years ago in an effort to eliminate the most
common type of general liability policy, that covering any damage
that occurs during the policy term regardless of when the damage is
discovered.
   Reinsurers provide vital backup coverage for other insurers, Van
de Kamp said.
   The attorneys general of California, New York, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Alabama filed similar suits
in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, naming 32 insurance
companies, underwriters and associations.
   Van de Kamp said Arizona would sue in the same court Wednesday.
A separate lawsuit was filed in state court in Austin, Texas.
   ``These defendants have sucked the blood of our nation's
economic well-being,'' Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox said at a
news conference. Texas filed suit in state court because the state
``has one of the toughest, best antitrust laws in the nation,'' he
said.
   As a result of the conspiracy, California's suit said, property
damage insurance for local governments, non-profit agencies such as
child care centers, and various businesses suddenly became
unavailable or prohibitively expensive.
   In California and elsewhere, local governments cut back or
eliminated services, such as parks and police, because of insurance
expenses, Van de Kamp said. Many local government officials blamed
rising damage awards in injury suits and joined the insurance
industry in efforts to restrict the right to sue.
   The lawsuits claim the companies targeted for elimination
coverage for spills and other types of pollution incidents and
general liability for damage discovered after the life of a policy,
known as ``occurrence'' coverage.
   The companies instead favored more limited policies, covering
only losses that were suffered and claimed within the policy term,
excluding damage that was discovered later, the suits said.
   The lawsuits said four major insurance companies _ Hartford,
Allstate, Cigna and Aetna _ started a campaign in 1984 to curtail
coverage that was generally available in the industry.
   According to the suits, the companies got major U.S. and British
reinsurers, including underwriters at Lloyd's of London, to
threaten a boycott of any U.S. insurance company that provided the
broader coverage.
   Among other things, the plaintiffs seek to restructure the
Insurance Services Office by giving non-insurers a majority on its
board and making public its data on insurance coverage losses.
   Ostwald said from his office in New York City that pollution
insurance and ``occurrence'' coverage remained available, with some
restrictions.
   Pollution coverage was changed in response to expansive court
decisions, he said.
   ``It's simply incorrect to assert that an attempt was made to
impose this policy on the marketplace,'' he said, referring to the
alleged effort to scrap ``occurrence'' coverage.
   Insurance rates increased mainly because of ``a demonstrable
increase in claims losses and a drop in interest rates, slowing
down (insurers') investment income,'' he said.
   Steven Perelman, a spokesman for Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.,
a defendant in Texas and California, termed the action ``another
political move by political officeholders who have consistently
opposed any and all efforts to address the real problems of the
nation's liability system.''
   David Willis, spokesman for the Cigna Property and Casualty
Group, also named in both lawsuits, said, ``It's really an
ingrained condition of how we operate in all our jurisdictions that
we conform to whatever antitrust regulations exist. We do not
violate laws.''
   In addtion to ISO, the suit in Texas named eight companies that
served on the ISO executive committee: Aetna, Cigna, Fireman's Fund
Insurance Co., Hartford Fire Insurance Co., Liberty Mutual
Insurance Co., St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., The
Travelers Insurance Co. and USF&G Corp.
   Also named in Texas were the Reinsurance Association of America
and reinsurers Merrett Non-Marine Syndicate No. 799 and Robin A.G.
Jackson. Merrett is part of Lloyd's of London, and Jackson is its
underwriter.
   In California, the defendants are: ISO, Hartford; Allstate
Insurance Co.; Aetna; Cigna; Peter N. Miller; Robin A.G. Jackson;
