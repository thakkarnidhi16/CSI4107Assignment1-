   The Baltimore Orioles snapped their
record-breaking losing streak at 21 games Friday night, beating the
Chicago White Sox 9-0 for their first win of the season.
   The Orioles did it in style, allowing only four hits and letting
only one runner get past first base.
   Three cases of champagne were on ice and waiting for the Orioles
in their clubhouse afterward, the reward for the worst start in
major league history.
   Baltimore established the longest losing streak in American
League history with Thursday's defeat in Minnesota. They stopped
short of the major league mark of 23 consecutive losses by the
Philadelphia Phillies in 1961.
   The old record for the worst start in major league history was
held by both the 1904 Washington Senators and the 1920 Detroit
Tigers, who lost their first 13 games.
   A crowd of 14,059 sat quietly in 56-degree temperature as
Baltimore stopped its march of misery.

<HEAD>Space Shuttle in Mothballs at Vandenberg, But Unmanned Launches
Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force officials
announced plans Thursday to increase unmanned launches at this
coastal base, after reaffirming a decision to put its space shuttle
facilities in mothballs.
   Col. Sebastian Colitore said at the 25th Annual Space Congress
convention Thursday in Cocoa Beach, Fla., that the Air Force would
build one new launch pad and modify another at the base to launch
the Titan 4 missile.
   His statement came a day after Maj. Gen. Donald Cromer, chief of
the Space and Missile Test Organization at Vandenberg, reaffirmed a
February announcement that the $3.5 billion shuttle launch facility
at Vandenberg was being placed in mothballs because of federal
budget cuts.
   Cromer said the move would save the Air Force $40 million in
1989.
   The Air Force plans to use the shuttle pad to launch other,
unmanned missles, Maj. Sgt. Bruce Zielsdorf, a Vandenberg
spokesman, said Thursday.
   The Titan 4, the military's workhorse missile, carries huge,
shuttle-sized payloads and satellites into orbit. The first planned
launch of the Titan 4, which is 20 feet taller than the shuttle at
204 feet, is set for February 1990, Colitore said.
   The Air Force also will modify another launch pad for old Titan
2 intercontinental missiles that are being refurbished into space
boosters, said Lt. Col. Mike Callaway, project manager. The first
launch of the Titan 2 is set for July 1 at Vandenberg, he said.
   Colitore said the Air Force would increase its unmanned launches
at Vandenberg, 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles on the California
coast.
   The Vandenberg shuttle site has been regularly maintained at a
cost of $50 million a year since the space shuttle Challenger
exploded during launch in Florida in January 1986, killing the
seven people aboard.
   It was to be the next site of a shuttle launch in July 1986. But
after the Challenger disaster, NASA moved the launch back to 1992.
Now launches have been indefinitely postponed at Vandenberg,
although an August shuttle launch is planned at Cape Canaveral in
Florida.
   Even if Vandenberg's vast shuttle complex, which includes a
launch pad, buildings and runway, were to be reactivated, it would
take at least four years for it to be functional, Zielsdorf said.

   The Florida lottery's first
computerized numbers game produced 859 winners Friday night, and
that didn't include the St. Petersburg Times, which published a
photo of a winning ticket hours before the contest.
   A photograph at the top of the front page of Friday morning's
paper showed the numbers 8-0-6, which proved to be the winning
combination in the first Cash 3 contest. The photo showed a sample
ticket sent to the paper a month ago.
   ``This was entirely coincidental,'' City Editor Jack Reed said.
``It doesn't seem like that should need to be said, but we've
gotten so many calls.''
   The Cash 3 winners will split a total payout of $94,090.
   Sales of the Lotto and Cash 3 tickets began when Lt. Gov. Bobby
Brantley purchased two Cash 3 betting slips.
   But the kickoff was delayed several minutes when a computer
terminal at the new lottery headquarters refused to issue
Brantley's tickets because the terminal's password had not been
entered correctly.
   Across the state, 3,142 retailers were supposed to be hooked
into a central computer to begin dispensing the 50-cent Cash 3 and
$1 Lotto tickets.
   Several reported their machines were not working or said they
could not get through on a hotline set up by Control Data Corp.,
which is operating the on-line computer system.
   By 7:30 p.m., $616,543 had been wagered on Cash 3 and $345,377
on the Lotto game.
   ``Most on-line games start out slow and then grow,'' lottery
Secretary Rebecca Paul said. She predicted combined Lotto and Cash
3 sales would surpass $10 million in the first eight days of sales,
and $1 billion in the first year.
   Thirty-five percent of all lottery revenue is earmarked for
public education.
   Twenty-eight states, including Florida, and the District of
Columbia have legalized lotteries. Law enforcement officials hope
the Florida games will help undermine illegal numbers rackets.
   ``Some of the people down here have been playing illegal numbers
since they were teen-agers,'' said Lt. Norflett Harris of the Miami
Police vice squad. ``But if they can find a way to play the same
amount, win the same amount and do it legally, I'm reasonably sure
a lot of them will switch over and play the legal game or start
playing both.''
   Cash 3 offers daily top prizes of $500. Players pick numbers
from 000 to 999.
   In the Lotto game, players pick six numbers from 1 to 49. The
first winning number will be drawn May 7 when the jackpot will be
at least $2 million, but could reach $4 million.

   Helga Huitt is 83 years old, doesn't do
a lot of driving and gets very few parking tickets.
   Well, she gets a lot of tickets, actually, but she shouldn't.
   Mrs. Huitt, who lives in Manhattan, had a license plate stolen
from her 1975 Plymouth Duster in Albany two years ago.
   By the end of the next day, she had reported the theft to New
York City police and received new plates from the Department of
Motor Vehicles.
   That was not the end of it.
   Mrs. Huitt has gotten notices from the New York City Parking
Violations Bureau about 169 unpaid tickets totaling $9,299,
including interest and penalties.
   She tried to explain, but the notices kept coming. A default
judgment had been issued, they said. We can take your property and
bank accounts, they said.
   ``I was living in a nightmare,'' she said.
   Finally through the help of state Sen. Mary Goodhue, Mrs. Huitt
was given a letter here on Thursday from the parking bureau
clearing her of the tickets and saying she didn't owe New York City
a cent _ for now.
   ``We solved this, but there is something wrong with the
system,'' Mrs. Goodhue said Thursday. She and Gregory Breen, an
administrative supervisor for the PVB said that as long as someone
is still out there with her license plate, the computers say it's
her car violating the parking laws.
   And she'll still get dunning notices.
   ``There is nothing in the system to trip it if someone has
reported the car stolen or the plates stolen,'' said Mrs. Goodhue.
   Mrs. Huitt had so much trouble because she had lost the police
receipt showing she had reported her car stolen. That infuriates
Mrs. Goodhue.
   ``There should be a system to double check against stolen
license plates and stolen cars,'' she said. ``You can have two cars
out there with the same plate and the wrong person getting dunned.
These things shouldn't be allowed to continue happening. PVB
computers should talk to DMV computers.''
   Breen admitted that there was no mechanical system that would
notify PVB that a ticket was given to a stolen car or plate.
   The burden of proof was on the victim, as it were, to show that
the vehicle on the ticket isn't theirs or wasn't where the ticket
said it was, he said.
   Mrs. Huitt, now driving a 1987 Ford Escort, says she will frame
her ``$10,000 letter.''
   Breen said she should also hope police find the car with her
license plate and destroy that plate so her nightmare can end for
good.

   Palestinian Moslems respond to a prayer call
from a minaret and head for a mosque in the Old City. A few hundred
yards away, ultra-Orthodox Jews dressed in black bow again and
again before a stone wall.
   Arabs and Israelis, enemies but neighbors inside the walls of
ancient Jerusalem, pass without speaking. Israeli riot police stand
guard on rooftops and in alleys, where anti-Israeli graffiti are
scrawled on some walls.
   Jerusalem is a city both Jews and Moslem passionately claim _
and, reluctantly, share.
   For the Jews, it is, as the Old Testament's Psalms say,
``Jerusalem, my highest joy.'' For the Moslems, it is ``Al Quds,''
or ``The Holy.''
   Its name means ``city of peace,'' but it is at the heart of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   If Secretary of State George P. Shultz is able to persuade the
two sides to sit at a negotiating table, the issue of this city's
future is likely to be a major stumbling block.
   Initially settled about 2,500 years before the birth of Christ,
Jerusalem has been beseiged and conquered 37 times by foreign
forces, including the Romans, the Crusaders and the Arab general
Saladin.
   Today, walled ancient Jerusalem covers a crowded square mile of
narrow cobblestone streets, broad courtyards hidden behind locked
doors, and a colorful Arab market often shuttered by strikes in the
5-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   Nowhere in Jerusalem are Jewish-Arab differences more strongly
felt than in the Old City.
   Hundreds of Palestinian worshipers and Israeli troops converge
each Friday for Moslem prayers at the city's two holiest mosques,
the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa, where angry Arab protests often
erupt.
   Tear gas thrown to quell the demonstrations sometimes disturbs
Jewish prayers at the adjoining Western Wall, the last remnant of
the second Jewish temple destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 and
Judaism's holiest shrine.
   It is here that Israel seeks to break the back of the uprising
by forcing merchants who supply the occupied West Bank to obey
Israeli rule instead of Palestine Liberation Organization orders.
   Fourteen Arab merchants face up to two years in jail for opening
shops during PLO-ordained hours in violation of army orders.
   As the city grows increasingly tense, however, most of the
17,000 Moslems and 2,000 Jews who live inside ancient Jerusalem say
they grow more determined in their commitment to stay.
   ``The Old City tastes of history. In every stone there is a
book,'' said Palestinian poet Fawzi Bakri, born within Jerusalem's
walls 42 years ago.
   ``I don't live in Jerusalem _ it lives in me,'' he said. ``I can
never leave.''
   For Israeli Evelyn Davis, who has lived here five years, the
soul of the Old City is in its Western Wall, also known as the
Wailing Wall.
   ``The wall offers solace to so many Jewish people. You see them
day after day, talking to God,'' said Mrs. Davis, 44, a native of
Greenbelt, Md.
   ``But the Old City is more than a shrine. It is my home,'' she
said. ``If I am threatened, I will turn into a she-bear.''
   The Old City was held by Jordan for the first 19 years of
Israeli history, until Jewish troops overran it in the 1967 war.
Then Israel proclaimed the city its capital, a decision that Arabs
refuse to recognize.
   Palestinians in Jerusalem still recall Israel's conquest with
bitterness.
   Mahmud Abu Sneineh, 52, said he was forced to leave his
apartment after the war when Israelis bought the building where he
lived. He moved to Hebron on the West Bank but was soon drawn back
to Jerusalem, even though he could afford only two rooms for his
family of six.
   ``Nothing can match the Old City,'' he said. ``We will stay here
and die here, which will surely happen because blood will be shed
over this city.''
   Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai sees the problem in dark terms. In
his book ``Poems of Jerusalem,'' he writes:
   ``Jerusalem stone is the only stone that can
   Feel pain. It has a network of nerves.
   From time to time Jerusalem crowds into
   Mass protests like the tower of Babel.
   And afterward the city disperses, muttering
   Prayers of complaint and sporadic screams from churches
   And synagogues and loud-moaning mosques.
   Each to his own place.''
   Palestinian poet Bakri knows Amichai's poetry and appreciates
that others love this city as he does. But he supports the Arab
revolt.
   ``My only fear,'' Bakri said, fingering worry beads, ``is that
the uprising brings this city closer to more calamity.''

<TEXT>
   The roughly chiseled features and
downcast eyes are all that remain as reminders of the little girl
who lived here more than 2,000 years ago.
   Nearby, looking down at her in the excavation, stood another
little girl, this one from the modern village that had been built
atop the ancient Saar burial mounds where the chiseled stone was
found in February.
   The village girl's hair was cut short, like that of the girl in
stone; they could have been sisters had they not been born 20
centuries apart.
   The ``little girl tombstone'' is one of five identified as
belonging to the Tylos culture that existed on this island in the
Persian Gulf around the time of Christ.
   The thousands of ancient graves on Bahrain, 30 miles long an 10
miles across at its widest point, once gave rise to a theory that
it was used as a regional burying ground.
   However, the Danish archaeologist Bruno Frolich, among others,
says, ``There is no existing evidence that requires us to assume
that the dead were anything other than inhabitants of Bahrain
island.''
   Over the years, many of these burial sites have been obliterated
by population and urban growth, a process that continues. The Saar
mounds are being excavated under pressure from developers who own
the property and are impatient to have it cleared.
   ``Our problem is that the construction of new buildings is
coming very quickly,'' said Abdul Aziz Sowaileh, the superintendent
of archaeology. ``Bahrain would like to build houses, houses. And
everywhere you dig in Bahrain, you will find some evidence of the
prehistoric or ancient past.
   ``So we can't preserve all the mounds, but we try to do our best
to preserve as many as we can.''
   At this site, known as the ``baby grave,'' 85 graves radiate
from the center of a giant burial mound, with the most recent at
the outer edges.
   Thirty-five jars containing skeletal remains of infants were
also found here, giving the site its name.
   Sowaileh said some burial jars, pottery and skeletal remains
probably will be removed and exhibited in Bahrain's new national
museum.
   Ancient writings suggest Bahrain may have been the Garden of
Eden described in the Old Testament. The Sumerians of what is now
southern Iraq knew the island as Dilmun, during the Bronze Age,
some 4,500 years ago.
   Succeeding cultures built atop earlier ones, making this a rich
area for archaeologists. Although most of the Saar mounds, a few
miles west of Manama, Bahrain's main city, are older, this
particular site dates from the Greco-Roman period, 200 B.C.-200
A.D., when the island was called Tylos.
   For centuries, Bahrain, which is near the Persian Gulf's western
shore, has been a stopping-off place for traders, merchants,
pirates and armies on the move.
   Alexander the Great never reached Bahrain during 13 years of
conquering the world as he knew it, but some of his generals did.
   Along with skeletal remains, the contents of other graves
escaped pillage over the years. One family mound has yielded a
trove of about 1,000 items _ necklaces, glazed pottery and
glassware, some in relatively good condition.
   The mounds are rounded cones, enclosing burial chambers or grave
complexes. From afar, they resemble giant anthills. Up close, they
are distinguished from natural formations by their even appearance.
   Some rise to about six feet, others are at ground level. At this
site, the chambers are generally below ground, cut into bedrock.
   Bahrain still has about 100,000 known burial mounds.
   In 1880, a British officer-explorer, E.L. Durand, wrote in his
journal: ``Mighty mounds, bare of vegetation, tower above the palm
groves. Mass upon mass, mound upon mound, they stretch on in
endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to
the sea.''
   The 30 Tylos mounds, of which the family site is one, could
prove important in the study of the Tylos civilization. Sowaileh
said it shows, for example, that people of that time made glazed
pottery.
   ``We also notice a change in burial customs from this period,''
he said. ``People are buried clothed, their positions are changed,
so they are placed on their backs, and put into some kind of
coffin. We didn't see these things before the Greeks came to
Bahrain.''
   He said the discovery of more than 300 silver Greek coins, some
bearing the likeness of Alexander the Great, indicate that ancient
Tylos, like modern Bahrain, was a flourishing trade center.
   Sowaileh, surveying the gravesite as he spoke, said the
craftsmanship of such artifacts as the ``little girl tombstone'' is
local.
   ``There are other tombstones, very similar to this one, that
have inscriptions in Greek, and must have been made for the Greek
people living here at the time. But they don't have the facial
representation like this one,'' he said of the little girl in stone.
   The little girl from the village had wandered off by now to
rejoin her playmates digging in dirt piled near the mound.
   Her past is only now being discovered.

<TEXT>
   The southern Polish mill town of Nowa Huta
where thousands of steelworkers went on strike this week for higher
pay was built in the 1950s to be a model socialist community.
   With a population of 220,000 people, Nowa Huta _ the name means
New Steel Mill _ dates from a Polish government resolution passed
in 1949 by the communist government, then entering its Stalinist
period.
   The government's aim was to build a huge steel plant next to the
ancient Polish capital of Krakow, then a stronghold of the Roman
Catholic intelligentsia class that resisted the communist takeover
of Poland.
   Peasants from around Poland were brought to Nowa Huta with
promises of a better life. They were to build the town and the
steel plant and then work in the factory.
   The building of the town was celebrated in popular songs of the
period and portrayed in many Polish films, including Andrzej
Wajda's ``Man of Marble,'' about a model socialist worker who
becomes disillusioned with the system.
   Today Nowa Huta is a drab working-class district which, like the
rest of Krakow, suffers from heavy pollution from the plant. The
plant's 32,000 workers mostly live in the community.
   At first Nowa Huta was a separate town, but it was incorporated
as Krakow's largest district in 1951.
   Besides the steel plant named after Lenin, the town features a
huge monument to the first Soviet leader. The monument was damaged
in a 1979 dynamite attack, but later was restored by authorities.
   Until 1977, the town had no church in keeping with its
model-socialist image. But Krakow's then-archbishop, Cardinal Karol
Wojtyla, now Pope John Paul II, worked relentlessly on government
authorities for permission to build one.
   On May 15, 1977, he succeeded and consecrated the ultramodern
Church of the Holy Ark, a local landmark and today one of at least
five churches in Nowa Huta.

   Iran's twin defeats by the Iraqis on the
Faw peninsula and the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf have undermined
its strategy that a war of attrition would eventually exhaust Iraq,
military analysts say.
   ``Time is no longer on our side,'' Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's
powerful Parliament speaker and a member of the Supreme Defense
Council, admitted in a Tehran Radio interview last week.
   ``That's very indicative that maybe the so-called pragmatists in
Tehran are now going to get the upper hand. The Iranians have had a
lot of sense knocked into them in the last few weeks,'' said
Hans-Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist with the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   Iran's defeats on land and sea last week were their most serious
in several years and analysts believe Tehran needs a spectacular
operation to regain the initiative in the 7{-year-old gulf war.
   Iraq's Faw peninsula, captured by the Iranians in February 1986,
was considered a ``strategic boon,'' but not vital. An Iraqi force
led by units of the elite Presidential Guards seized the peninsula
April 16-18.
   ``Its loss has had a major psychological impact,'' Kopietz said.
   Iran's loss of two frigates and a missile boat sunk or disabled
by the U.S. Navy on April 18 _ in the first serious clash between
the Iranians and Americans _ is considered more important because
those warships cannot be replaced.
   Already, Iran's navy suffers a lack of spare parts and missiles,
and most of its major surface ships, including two U.S.-built
destroyers, are believed non-operational.
   ``The Iranians are having to rethink their whole strategy,''
Kopietz said in a telephone interview. ``They've lost the
initiative in many ways and they'll have to do something to get it
back. The pressure is on them to pull off something spectacular.''
   Kopietz and other Western analysts said an escalation in the
Iraqis' use of outlawed chemical weapons in recent weeks and a
seven-week missile bombardment of Iranian cities has also taken its
toll on Iranian morale.
   A sustained bombing campaign by Iraq's superior air force has
damaged Iran's already battered economy. Prime targets have been
oil refineries and installations and power plants.
   Sources in the petroleum industry, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the bombing has cut Iran's refining capacity by
about a third.
   Oil exports, Iran's economic lifeblood, have been disrupted by
Iraqi air raids on tankers in the gulf. A drop in demand for oil
and increasingly shaky prices on the world market have eroded oil
revenue on which the Iranians depend to pay for their war effort.
   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry weekly
newsletter published in Cyprus, reports that Iran has imported
about 3 million barrels of refined petroleum products, such as
kerosene and aviation gas, in recent weeks.
   ``This unprecedented sudden import of gas oil could be due to
damage inflicted on Iranian refineries because of the war,'' the
newsletter says.
   Diplomats recently in Tehran reported that almost two-thirds of
the country's factories have been shut down by shortages of raw
materials and spare parts. Others are operating at half their
normal capacity or less.
   Only factories producing weapons, ammunition and other
war-related items are working at full tilt, they said.
   Iran is also increasingly isolated diplomatically. Saudi
Arabia's decision on Tuesday to sever its long-touchy relations
with Tehran, citing ``terrorism and subversion,'' was another blow.
   ``I'm sure other Arab states in the gulf will follow,'' Kopietz
said. ``Despite the war, Iran relies on countries like the United
Arab Emirates for trade and if that's affected it could have very
serious repercussions.''
   Since April 18, Iranian leaders, including Rafsanjani and
President Ali Khamenei, have been calling on their countrymen to
mobilize, vowing revenge against Iraq, the United states and
``reactionary states'' like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
   ``We are prepared to conduct military operations on several
fronts,'' Rafsanjani declared.
   But the Iranians failed to launch their big winter offensive
this year, triggering speculation that despite boasts of having
trained 5 million men and women Tehran is having recruiting
problems.
   Lt. Gen. George B. Crist, the Marine officer who commands U.S.
forces in the region, testifed before the Senate Armed Forces
Committee recently that Iran was not capable of launching a major
offensive in the foreseeable future because of manpower and
materiel problems.
   Although the Iranians outnumber the Iraqis three-to-one in
population, Crist said ``the fact is that the Iraqis right now have
more men under arms than the Iranians do.''
   But despite the problems, the analysts do not believe the
Iranians are likely give up what Islamic patriarch Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini considers a crusade to crush his long-time
adversary, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.

at least four, authorities said.
   The accident occurred on a Cascade Mountain highway near Bagby
Hot Springs, about 30 miles southeast of Portland, as the van

   The grocery cart of the future is here _ a
high-tech, video-equipped gadget that can say hello and offer
games, shopping tips, sports scores and _ here's the catch _
on-the-spot advertising to the consumer.
   ``We're expecting it to make shopping more fun, less of a hassle
and more efficient for consumers,'' said Forrest Anderson, director
for marketing communications at Information Resources Inc., which
developed the cart.
   The Chicago-based marketing-research company spent two years
inventing the VideOcart, with a liquid-crystal-display video screen
mounted near the kiddie seat to entertain, inform and offer a few
words from the sponsors.
   Shoppers using IRI's VideOcarts will be able to call up store
maps, reserve numbers at the deli counter, find out which checkout
line is shortest, play tic tac toe or trivia games to pass the time
in line, and get the time, weather forecast or sports scores.
   The carts would be provided free to the supermarkets, with costs
paid by advertisers whose commercials could be transmitted
nationally by satellite to local supermarkets.
   The high-tech carts are to be test-marketed this fall in three
stores, Anderson said _ one in the Chicago area, the others in
cities not yet chosen.
   If the test-marketing goes well, IRI plans to introduce the
carts in major-city grocery stores in July 1989 and go national in
1991 with carts in 10,000 supermarkets.
   The video screens will be especially encased to make them
``kid-proof, grape-juice-proof, shock and water resistant,'' with
an alarm system to prevent theft, Anderson said.
   Ads will make up about 15 percent of the programming. The rest
will be entertainment and information services.
   IRI Chairman John Malec, who developed the cart introduced in
Chicago and New York this week, called it ``the most important new
advertising and promotion medium since television.''
   Using sensors in the aisles, an ad for coffee or soda pop can be
automatically triggered when the cart reaches the area where those
products are shelved.
   The use of in-store advertising _ signs attached to shopping
carts, sales pitches on store sound systems and the like _ has
burgeoned in recent years, with spending growing 14 percent a year
over the past decade to an estimated $12.6 billion last year,
according to industry estimates.
   VideOcart offers the advantage of packaging the ads with
entertainment, said Malec.
   IRI plans to invest $200 million over the next three years in
developing the system, Anderson said.
   One food-company official expressed interest in the carts, but
said he would want to see the test-market results before making a
commitment.
   Ronald Frahler, retail trade promotion manager for the
Deerfield, Ill.-based Kitchens of Sara Lee, a major frozen
baked-goods producer, suggested there might be some confusion as
shoppers get used to wheeling and viewing.
   ``There is probably going to be some bumping into each other,''
said Frahler, who viewed the cart in Chicago.
   But he said ``the concept is fascinating and it seems to be well
thought out.''

   Yuppies who can't afford to have it all are
calling on a new accessory to tone up their image _ a fake cellular
phone that's a dead ringer for the must-have gadget.
   ``We are a status-driven city _ there's no doubt about it,''
said Michelle Stein, president of Neu Tech, a Dallas high-tech
accessory store.
   The Cellular Phoney is a realistic copy of the devices that have
become standard fixtures in the BMWs and Mercedes of big-city
dealmakers.
   At $15.95 for the handset and a fake, stick-on antenna, the fake
phones live up to the advertising slogan of ``status without the
static,'' Ms. Stein said.
   She said she has sold hundreds of the fake phones in the last
year, although she did not have an exact count.
   At Art Explosion, another Dallas store offering the Cellular
Phoneys, business is brisk whenever a new shipment arrives, said
salesman Larry Cornmesser.
   The Cellular Phoneys are made by Faux (that's French for
``false'') Systems in Los Altos, Calif. An estimated 40,000 phones
have been sold, many in Los Angeles, another hub of freeway fashion.
   But the items do well wherever the real phones are popular,
retailers said.
   At three Art Explosion outlets in Dallas, several hundred have
been sold since the Christmas season, said Martha Widlus,
spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Ohio.
   Other fake models also are on the market, including just the
antenna.
   Although many people are buying the Cellular Phoneys as gag
gifts, some find the gadgets ring true, Ms. Stein said.
   ``It's so incredibly real-looking that you have to begin to
wonder how many people driving around out there with an antenna on
the back of their car actually have a phony,'' she said.
   ``Everybody is hungering for high technology across the board
but because of cost prohibitions, not everybody can have them,''
she said.
   Some novelty store owners said they aren't so sure the phones
will do as well in Texas as in California.
   Said Les Cohen, owner of Palmer Sales of Dallas: ``Can you see a
Texan driving down the road, talking into a play phone on his way
to bankruptcy court?''

   The horseradish, touted through the
years for its ability to spice up everything from romance to steak,
grows nowhere quite so well as in the nation's ``horseradish
capital.''
   Now the proud farmers just across the Mississippi River from St.
Louis who still cultivate the ugly, pungent root that their
ancestors brought from Europe in the 19th century have decided it's
time to celebrate its success.
   So they're sponsoring the First International Horseradish
Festival Saturday in Collinsville, complete with contests to see
who can eat the most horseradishes or throw their roots the
farthest.
   So rich is the soil, so perfect the climate, so experienced the
farmers that this little section of southwestern Illinois produces
about 60 percent of the nation's horseradish supply.
   ``It's a lot of work but it's family tradition,'' said Craig
Keller, 31, a fourth generation horseradish grower. ``It's what we
know how to do, and we enjoy it.''
   The festival Saturday is co-sponsored by the growers and WRYT
radio.
   ``We'll have a horseradish root-throwing contest, spoon races
carrying horseradish, and a horseradish eating contest _ if we can
find someone willing to participate,'' said Kent Scheffel, general
manager of WRYT radio.
   Centuries ago, claims were made that the white root that can
grow up to a foot long would stimulate the appetite, relieve colic,
rid children of worms and serve as an aphrodisiac. Now, it's more
likely to be served with prime rib.
   Though actually a member of the mustard family, the Germans
called it a sea radish _ ``meerrettich.'' Many of today's plants
are from the original European root cuttings.
   ``It's like immortality,'' said plant geneticist Jack Juvik of
the University of Illinois, perhaps the only place horseradish
research is conducted.
   Growers say the best horseradish burns their tongues and makes
their eyes water _ and they love it.
   ``When you smash it with your teeth, there is a chemical
reaction and that makes the heat,'' said Keller. ``It gets real
hot.''
   Most of their crop is bought by companies that grind up the
roots and bottle them as traditional horseradish sauce.
   Besides volatile prices there are other problems for the
growers. Horseradishes have to be lifted from the soil by hand and
stripped of secondary roots; weeds have to be cultivated manually
since herbicide companies do not want to develop chemicals for a
low-volume crop; and machinery has to be built by the farmers.
   ``You don't call John Deere and say you want to buy a
horseradish picker,'' said Keller, who harvests from 5,000 to
10,000 pounds per acre.

   A car careened across a playground and plowed
into a crowd of children and adults about to leave an elementary
school Thursday, killing a 4-year-old girl and a woman and injuring
eight others, officials said.
   At least four of the injured were in critical condition.
   ``I called for 10 ambulances,'' said Jim Crowe, principal at
Cyrus H. McCormick Elementary School. ``I told them there were
bodies all over the playground.''
   The motorist, Isabel Fuentes, 37, was charged late Thursday with
leaving the scene of an accident and negligent driving, said
Officer Terry Pickens. She was freed after posting $100 bail and
her driver's license, he said.
   ``Our opinion is that she was driving too fast for conditions,''
said Sgt. Thomas Reynolds. He didn't know exactly how fast she was
traveling but said Mrs. Fuentes, who suffered a bloody nose, was
going over the 20 mph limit.
   Witnesses said the car crashed through a chain-link fence and
careened across the playground before running up a short flight of
stairs to where the crowd was gathered in an entryway at the school.
   ``I was standing outside the school picking up my son when I
turned my head and saw the car coming towards the door,'' said
Marcella Diaz, 30, whose children, ages 8 and 5, attend the school.
``I just screamed and picked up my son with my hands and ran away.
The car missed us by a yard and a half.''
   ``There were mothers screaming, looking for their children,''
said Araceli Hernandez, whose niece lives with her and attends the
school. ``Almost every child that was on the floor had their mother
next to them.''
   The principal said the car pinned a child and an adult beneath
it.
   ``Myself and a couple of the teachers and a janitor picked the
car up and freed the bodies so they wouldn't be further crushed,''
he said.
   The driver walked from the scene, the car still wedged in the
entryway, witnesses said. Patrolman Richard Spielman said police
picked up the woman in the neighborhood minutes after the accident.
   Reuben Fuentes, a student at McCormick, said the car belonged to
his family and that his mother apparently had come to the school to
pick him up. ``I got on my bus. I just saw my car, I don't know
where my mother is,'' he said.
   A 4-year-old girl and a woman died at Cook County and Mount
Sinai hospitals, spokeswomen said.
   In critical condition in Cook County Hospital were a 7-year-old
boy and a 10-year-old girl, both with head injuries, and two
children, ages 6 and 9, with leg fractures. A 7-year-old boy with
head injuries was in fair condition.
   A 29-year-old parent was hit by the car and thrown into air but
escaped serious injury, said Mount Sinai spokeswoman Dianne Smith.
   Two children, ages 6 and 5, were taken to the hospital; one had
head and neck injuries and was expected to be released, and the
other had bumps and bruises and was in good condition, Ms. Smith
said.
   ``The car smashed into the entrance where the kids were coming
out,'' said Rose Cepak, 78, who lives nearby.
   Third-grade teacher James E. Bailey said he saw a youngster
trying to calm one of the injured women. ``A child was stroking her
hair and telling her everything would be all right,'' Bailey said.

   Thousands of destitute migrant workers
are being victimized by farmers who charge them as much as $400
each to prepare false immigration papers, authorities say.
   As many as 25,000 migrants dependent on social service agencies
for food and shelter are in the state, unemployed and waiting for
Oregon's strawberry harvest, the country's second largest after
California's, to begin about June 1.
   Under the nation's new immigration law, most migrants who picked
crops in the United States for at least 90 days in 1985-86 may
qualify as permanent resident aliens and continue to legally enter
the country to work in future years.
   Some farmers are preparing fraudulent documents for migrants who
otherwise would not qualify under the law, said David Beebe, the
district director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Portland.
   Others demand excessive fees to prepare the documents the
migrants must present to federal authorities to fulfill the law's
requirements, he said.
   ``The Immigration Service is aware of unscrupulous employers ...
who are finding new ways to exploit workers,'' Beebe said. He
emphasized, however, that the majority of strawberry growers treat
pickers fairly.
   Beebe declined to comment on what steps his agency is taking to
deal with the dishonest farmers and their allies, including
printers who can prodcuce false rent receipts and other documents.
   The agricultural workers have until Nov. 30 to file the papers.
After that, employers who hire illegal migrant workers will face
stiff penalties.
   The migrants must pay $185 each to apply for amnesty under the
new law. Fees for physical examinations, pictures and other
required documents push the cost to near $300.
   Strawberry farmer Doug Krahmer said he has heard of growers
charging as much as $400 additional to prepare the paperwork.
Another grower, who asked not to be identified, said he's heard
some farmers are charging $250.
   Krahmer estimated that as many as one-fourth of the migrants are
being charged more than $25 to help defray the costs involved. He
said he charges $20 to process paperwork for migrants seeking
documentation at his Lloy-Dene Farms near Cornelius.
   But Matt Unger, chairman of the Oregon Strawberry Commission,
said he knows of no grower charging more than $25.
   ``The ones I know of charge nothing or a nominal fee,'' he said.
   Krahmer said labor contractors, brokers who sign up and deliver
the pickers to growers, are promising the papers to attract
workers. Last year, the strawberry crop was harvested early and 20
percent of the crop was left in the fields because not enough
workers were in the state.
   Many pickers say they were told they must turn in their
documentation by May 4, the deadline for aliens who aren't involved
in agricultural work. Hundreds of migrant pickers, confused by the
heavily publicized May deadline, are rushing to INS offices around
the state.
   The result this year has been an influx of migrants, nearly all
men and teen-age boys, weeks before the crop is ready to be picked.
   Typical of these is 14-year-old Felix Lopez, who is broke, on
his own and a long way from his home.
   Speaking in Spanish, the teen-ager from Ensenada, Mexico, said
he has never picked strawberries in Oregon before, but that a
``friend'' told him growers would sign the papers he needs to keep
returning here to work.
   The Rev. David E. Zegar, of St. Alexander's Catholic Church in
Cornelius, said he believes contractors have drawn migrants to
Oregon early by falsely promising to arrange their immigration
papers. The workers stay in labor camps without money, food and
other essentials, he said, waiting for the strawberries to ripen
while social service agencies struggle to meet their needs.
   ``I don't think anybody has the right to put people into a
situation where they have to beg for food and essentials,'' Zegar
said.
   At Centro Cultural, the community center in Cornelius, migrants
watch Spanish-language television in the lobby and wait for dinner,
served Monday through Thursday at 3 p.m. Each day, Centro Cultural
serves an average of more than 200 free meals of beans, potatoes
and tortillas to the migrants.
   The Salvation Army is meeting the needs of thousands of other
migrants, distributing tons of beans, potatoes, rice and flour.
   The uncertainty over the workforce has led many growers in
Oregon to abandon planting strawberries; plantings for next year
are down 75 percent. Plantings are up in California, the largest
strawberry producer, which has a resident picker population and
isn't reliant on foreign labor.
   Last year, Oregon produced a bumper crop of 94 million pounds
which sold for a record $31.5 million.

<HEAD>Original Gilbert And Sullivan Company Reborn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUNDERLAND, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New D'Oyly Carte Opera Company
was launched on the stage, performing the comic Gilbert and
Sullivan operas that made the founding company famous for 107 years.
   The new company opened a 10-day run Thursday at the Empire
Theater in the northeast England industrial town of Sunderland with
a preview of ``Iolanthe,'' which drew five minutes of applause.
``The Yeomen of the Guard'' will follow next Wednesday.
   ``I thought it went splendidly and I hope to see us touring the
United States and Canada before very long,'' said Richard Condon,
the company's general manager.
   The critics will be at tonight's gala relaunch.
   ``The red-hot night is Friday,'' said theater manager Colin
Angus. ``My experience teaches me that you have to have a warm-up
preview to get everything right. If you go in cold, the chances
always are that it will go wrong.''
   Fans of librettist Sir William S. Gilbert and composer Sir
Arthur Sullivan said the production style was a big improvement on
the original company's last years, when it was condemned as ``old
and tired'' by the state-funded Arts Council. The company folded in
1982 for lack of money when it was refused a subsidy.
   The ``Iolanthe'' plot _ ludicrous like all the Gilbert and
Sullivan works _ mocks the law and the unelected House of Lords in
Parliament, as well as the English fancy for putting on robes,
wigs, coronets and velvet knee breeches, by involving the Lord
Chancellor and his fellow peers with the Fairy Queen and her
followers.
   ``The pure Englishness _ not even Britishness _ of Gilbert and
Sullivan makes their work difficult for a foreigner like me,'' said
the only American in the 103-member company, New York-born Tom
Emlyn Williams, who sings tenor and baritone.
   ``Some of the Gilbert rhymes can only be understood by English
people. The operettas have been translated, though I can hardly
believe it,'' he said.
   Canadian soprano Patricia Cameron from Halifax, Nova Scotia,
said the only problems she encountered were with the fairy wings.
   ``Some didn't arrive, some wouldn't stand straight and some fell
off,'' she said.
   ``I felt the long history of the company was a bit of pressure
on us to do well,'' Miss Cameron added.
   The new company has an office in London but no home. Angus has
offered his ornate theater, completed in 1907, as a permanent
touring base.
   Condon said the two operas for the relaunch have meant an
investment of about $1.3 million.
   The company was reborn on a bequest from the estate of the
founder's granddaughter, Dame Bridget D'Oyly Carte, who died in
1985, plus commercial sponsorship and donations from supporters
worldwide.
   Richard D'Oyly Carte, a Victorian impresario, started the
company in 1875 to stage the operettas and built London's Savoy
Hotel and Savoy Theater from the proceeds.
   Gilbert and Sullivan collaborated on 14 works over 25 years,
including ``The Pirates of Penzance,'' ``The Mikado'' and ``H.M.S.
Pinafore.''
   Other companies, professional and amateur, perform the Savoy
Operas, as the works are known. But the D'Oyly Carte company is the
only one devoted entirely to them.

   ``60 Minutes'' newswoman Diane Sawyer plans to
marry for the first time today, to film director Mike Nichols, CBS
said.
   The match is the culmination of a six-month romance. The
location of the wedding was not disclosed by the network Thursday.
   Nichols, 56, a former comedian who went on to direct the films
``The Graduate'' and ``Silkwood'' and the plays ``The Odd Couple''
and ``The Real Thing,'' has been married twice before.
   It will be the first marriage for Miss Sawyer, a 42-year-old

   Actress Demi Moore says she and ``Moonlighting''
star Bruce Willis decided to get married last fall on a whimsy
spurred by a ``romantic'' boxing match.
   Now, she says, Willis spends his evenings watching video of
their soon-to-arrive child's ultrasound image.
   ``We watch it all the time _ you can see its little legs
moving,'' said Moore, the star of the new film ``The Seventh
Sign.'' Willis has already nicknamed the baby King, she told US
magazine for its May 16 issue.
   Willis, who developed a reputation for partying prior to his
marriage, wasn't ``tamed'' by Moore after their walk down the
aisle, she said.
   ``From the day I met him, I never saw this wild man, this person
who was like going crazy, pounding booze back or hanging from the
ceiling,'' she said. ``He was clear and focused.''
   However, she confessed, the couple's Las Vegas wedding last
November was on the spur of the moment.
   ``We were there for a boxing match and didn't plan on getting
married. And I guess the boxing match was just so romantic we
couldn't help ourselves,'' she said.

turmoil and revolution of 20th century China, will finally be
published in this country next month.
   Mrs. Lord, wife of U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord,
published the book in 1981. The novel was a U.S. bestseller for 37
weeks, and has been translated into 18 languages, including
Chinese, but has not appeared in China.
   The Chinese version was translated by Vice Minister of Culture
Ying Ruocheng and his late wife Wu Shiliang, the overseas edition
of the People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) said Thursday.
   Ying is also a well-known actor who starred as the prison warden
in Bernardo Bertolucci's Academy Award-winning movie ``The Last
Emperor.''
   U.S. and Chinese filmmakers in 1986 agreed to produce a movie
based on the book, but filming has yet to begin.

   The wife of James Brown has asked that
assault charges she filed against the soul music star be dropped,
prosecutors said.
   Adrienne Lois Brown filed the request Thursday seeking dismissal
of the charges, including assault with intent to kill and
aggravated assault and battery.
   Brown, 54, was charged April 5 in connection with alleged
attacks on his 38-year-old wife. Mrs. Brown has filed for divorce,
though the couple reportedly has reconciled in recent weeks.
   Second Circuit Solicitor Robert J. Harte said he retains
judgment over whether the charges against Brown will be dropped,
adding he will make that decision in four to six weeks.
   Brown, one of the legends of soul music, is known for such hits
as ``I Feel Good,'' ``Papa's Got A Brand New Bag'' and ``Living In
America.''

   Instead of slowing down, George Shultz is
stepping on the gas. But the determined secretary of state has
little to show for his vigorous diplomatic efforts in these final
months of the Reagan administration.
   He had hoped to open Mideast peace talks this Sunday, in the
first stage of an ambitious U.S. program aimed at providing some
measure of self-rule to the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live
on the Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza.
   But despite two trips to the area, Shultz was unable to persuade
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir or King Hussein of Jordan to
accept his proposal.
   Shultz says he will keep trying, and will try to find the time
to make another personal appeal to the Middle East leaders. But he
seems less optimistic than ever before.
   On the Soviet front, Shultz is making arrangements for President
Reagan's visit to Moscow May 29-June 2 for a fourth and probably
final summit meeting with General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The centerpiece was supposed to be a treaty to halve the Soviet
and U.S. arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons. But with only a
month left, the two sides are still far apart on such issues as the
U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative and how to monitor the reduction
of mobile missiles and other weapons that are relatively easy to
conceal.
   Even the treaty signed at last year's Washington summit to scrap
intermediate-range nuclear missiles is still awaiting Senate
approval.
   Shultz will try again May 11-12 in Geneva with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. But he appears to be lowering his
sights to a summit that would be mostly an exchange of views
between Reagan and Gorbachev instead of a historic event.
   Analysts differ on whether Gorbachev's decision to withdraw some
115,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan is a victory for U.S.
foreign policy or a decision taken by Moscow for its own reasons.
   But on other regional fronts there is little opportunity for the
Reagan administration to claim credit.
   The Soviets are resisting a U.S. plea that they help impose a
worldwide arms embargo on Iran. And they decline to accept a benign
role in a Middle East peace conference. ``I didn't achieve any
breakthrough,'' Shultz admitted Thursday to a Senate appropriations
subcommittee about his talks last week in Moscow.
   Taking the long view, he reminded the senators how cool the
U.S.-Soviet relationship was in 1985, before Gorbachev took over.
   Shultz's human rights pleas now get a respectful hearing, and
even some action. Jewish emigration hit a 15-month high last month.
   Giving the subject ``the pride of place'' on his agenda, Shultz
opened his talks with Shevardnadze with human rights and kept at it
for two hours.
   In the past, the Soviets mostly listened impassively to U.S.
pleas. Now American and Soviet lawyers and psychiatrists are
holding meetings to discuss the situation.
   Otherwise, though, even the climate is worsening.
   Gorbachev took sharp exception last week to a speech by Reagan
accusing the Soviets of aggression and other bad behavior.
   He complained the United States was ``sermonizing'' as well as
attributing any improvement in relations to a policy of strength.
   Shultz tried to minimize the criticism. He said there was a
``rhythm'' to U.S.-Soviet relations that had both moments of
progress and of discord.
   Other State Department officials were privately critical of the
tough rhetoric in Reagan's speech. They said it had not been
submitted to the department for review before delivery.
   Ever loyal, though, Shultz told the Senate subcommittee on
Thursday that ``we must call it as we see it.''

<HEAD>Senate-Passed AIDS Bill Would Provide $1.1 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate passage of a billion-dollar AIDS
research and education bill shows that the government has finally
``declared war on the virus and not on the victims,'' supporters
say.
   The Senate voted 87-4 for the $1.1 billion bill Thursday night
after agreeing unanimously to require AIDS tests on people
convicted of state or federal crimes related to sex or intravenous
drug use.
   The focus now shifts to the House, where a bill covering
research on AIDS is committee but measures addressing other
portions of the Senate legislation have not be introduced.
   The Senate bill authorizes $665 million for state and federal
AIDS education programs, increased hiring at the National
Institutes of Health, a new home health care program for AIDS
victims and special efforts to help high-risk minorities and
intravenous drug abusers. A committee aide said open-ended research
money would bring total annual spending to about $1.1 billion.
   ``Finally, we have declared war on the virus and not on the
victims in our battle against AIDS,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., who as chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee
spearheaded support for the bill.
   Victor Basile, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign
Fund, the national political action committee for the gay and
lesbian community, said he was ``delighted'' with bill, which he
said ``for the first time establishes a national policy on AIDS.''
   During frequently bitter debate, the Senate rejected or weakened
a number of amendments proposed by conservatives, several of them
by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   The most controversial was Helms' attempt to renew an expiring
1987 ban on federal money for educational materials that allegedly
promote or encourage homosexual activity. The ban passed 94-2 last
year, but some senators said it has hampered public health efforts
to reach the gay community.
   Helms' drive was fueled by a gay-oriented AIDS education
videotape he viewed with several senators on Wednesday. ``I thought
that I had seen everything until I saw this video,'' said the North
Carolina Republican. ``There's something wrong when federal tax
dollars are used for this garbage.''
   But the bill's Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
told his GOP colleague that he ought to consider public health
concerns and not just moral ones. ``We have to tell homosexuals
more than simply to become heterosexuals,'' he said.
   The Senate agreed to the Helms amendment, but the victory was
brief. Lawmakers also voted for a Kennedy amendment that said
nothing in the bill should prevent the dissemination of accurate
information to people at risk _ effectively superseding the Helms
provision.
   The debate provoked a number of outbursts. At one point Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., tried to get a quick vote on a
provision but Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., wouldn't let him.
   ``What the hell could be more important than 1.5 million people
who are going to die?'' Weicker exploded. ``I suggest we should
just stick to this business and just do it or not do it and go
home.''
   Homosexuals and intravenous drug users have been the chief
victims of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a fatal
disease spread through blood, blood products or semen. As of April
21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500 Americans, more than
half of whom have died.
   Helms was frustrated in several attempts to win an outright ban
on federal money for programs in which drug addicts exchange shared
and possibly AIDS-contaminated needles for clean ones.
   The final version says federal money could not be used for
clean-needle programs unless the surgeon general concludes they
help stop drug addiction or the spread of AIDS. A disgusted Helms
said ``it's just a matter of time'' before federal dollars flow
toward the programs.
   Under the testing amendment sponsored by Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., AIDS tests would be mandatory for those convicted of sex
or drug crimes carrying a penalty of at least a year in prison.
Results would be confidential but could be disclosed to prison
wardens or victims of sex crimes.
   The Reagan administration announced last year it would test new
immigrants and the Senate later put its stamp of approval on the
policy. The Defense Department tests all 2.1 million men and women
on active military duty as well as all recruit applicants and the
Justice Department said last October that it would test some
federal prisoners.
   Senators voting against the AIDS bill were Helms; William
Armstrong, R-Colo.; James McClure, R-Idaho, and Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; David Boren,
D-Okla.; Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.; Daniel Evans, R-Wash.; David
Karnes, R-Neb.; Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; John
Stennis, D-Miss; Steve Symms, R-Idaho.
   Despite the bill's approval, Kennedy said it only the first step
toward a national AIDS policy that also must address sensitive
testing and discrimination questions.
   ``The total effort has to include testing, confidentiality and
anti-discrimination provisions,'' he said. ``We begin work on those
tomorrow.''

<TEXT>
   In the bustling and often chaotic seafood
industry, Neal Workman casts a widening net for what might be the
most prized catch of all: Buyers who refuse to pay up.
   Workman's work has taken him on predawn visits to ramshackle
back offices in New York City's tough Fulton Fish Market, where
prudent debt collectors seldom venture in an industry notorious for
its proliferation of deadbeats.
   Bullhorn in hand, Workman has brazenly entered crowded seafood
restaurants at the height of the lunch hour to announce to patrons
that the fish on their plates may not have been paid for.
   ``It's the No. 1 problem in the industry,'' says the former debt
collector and sales representative for Dun & Bradstreet Inc., who
has carved out a fast-growing and profitable new business, Debt
Management Services.
   ``Fish is in such demand, it's so popular, that it's not hard to
sell. It's certainly not hard to sell a Maine lobster. The hard
part is to get paid for it.''
   Part of the problem is that seafood is a perishable commodity
whose value is at its highest when it hits the dock and then
diminishes rapidly.
   ``To get the most for their product before the value drops they
have to move it very quickly _ and that means they take unusual
risks,'' Workman explained.
   ``They'll sell to people knowing there's maybe only a 50-50
chance they'll get paid, as opposed to a 100 percent chance that
the fish will spoil and become a non-saleable item.''
   Because sellers are reluctant to communicate with each other for
fear of losing a competitive edge, unscrupulous restaurateurs and
wholesalers have been known to switch from supplier to supplier in
order to avoid ever having to pay their accounts due, Workman says.
   To combat such practices, Debt Management semimonthly publishes
SeaScan, a continuously updated list of hundreds of seafood
markets, restaurants, wholesalers, brokers and distributors who are
in arrears on their debts.
   The publication, about 50 pages long, consists of yellow pages
with the names of buyers whose payments are at least 30 days past
due; red pages listing buyers whose accounts have been referred to
the company for collection; and white pages, tagged the ``rubber
sheet,'' which lists buyers whose checks have bounced.
   ``Yellow is slow, red has stopped,'' Workman explains.
``Everyone who has stopped paying his bills slowed down first.''
   SeaScan is distributed to his company's more than 200 clients,
ranging from salmon harvesters in Scotland's Shetland Islands to
catfish producers in the Mississippi Delta to shrimp importers on
the West Coast.
   A seller who purchases the SeaScan report and becomes a Debt
Management client can refer past due accounts to Workman's company,
which receives a percentage of the overdue receivables it collects
in addition to a $2,500 a year membership fee.
   The 33-year-old Nyack, N.Y., native, who began the business
three years ago in his home, today has 17 employees and subsidiary
offices in Boston and Seattle. He says his clients are among the
largest in the industry, accounting for nearly half the dollar
volume of seafood sold in the U.S. market.
   Workman hasn't emerged unscathed from deadbeat raids. He recalls
the time three fish cutters grabbed him by the jacket at a seafood
wholesaler's in Pompano Beach, Fla., and tossed him unceremoniously
onto the sidewalk.
   But while inside the establishment, Workman had spotted some
boxes bearing the name of one of his major clients. He immediately
telephoned the client and apprised him of the situation; the
client, in turn, called the wholesaler and threatened to cut off
future shipments if he didn't pay the debt.
   Waiting for Workman when he returned was an apology and a check
for $15,000.

   Congressional investigators are portraying
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. as a greedy firm that elbowed its own
clients aside so top employees could profit on hot new issues of
high-yield, high-risk ``junk'' bonds.
   But Drexel chief executive Frederick H. Joseph, in 6{ hours of
testimony Thursday before the investigations subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, steadfastly defended the
firm's practice of permitting employees to form private
partnerships to compete with other investors for bonds underwritten
by Drexel.
   Under questioning from Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
both the committee and subcommittee, Joseph acknowledged ``the
perception of a conflict is troublesome.''
   Still, he said Drexel not only condones the partnerships, but
believes they benefit corporate bond issuers by making more money
available to buy the bonds.
   However, documents released by the subcommittee showed that on
several occasions Drexel employees purchased bonds from much-sought
issues for their own accounts at the same time the firm's public
customers were being turned away.
   In the case of Texstyrene Corp., a Phoenix, Ariz., manufacturer
of styrofoam products, partnerships owned by Drexel employees
purchased $12 million of an initial $50 million offering in
February 1986, according to the subcommittee.
   Public customers were allowed to buy only some of the bonds they
wanted, and within 17 days Drexel employees made more than $900,000
profits by selling the bonds back to Drexel, subcommittee documents
indicate.
   In another case, the subcommittee said, Drexel employees
purchased $235 million of a $2.5 billion issue in the April 1986
leveraged buyout of Beatrice Cos., a diversified food and consumer
products company.
   Again, other customers were denied the chance to purchase as
many bonds as they had initially ordered. And less than three
months later, the employees made a $2.8 million profit by selling
$61.4 million of the bonds, the subcommittee said.
   ``Any way you slice it, the people on the outside aren't getting
the same deal as the people on the inside,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore.
   Rep. Dennis E. Eckart, D-Ohio, said Drexel, in effect, ``elbowed
aside'' its own customers and ``cut to the head of the line.'' He
said a telephone survey of five top competitors of Drexel, whom he
declined to identify, showed that none would permit similar
practices.
   Joseph said it is quite common that investors will want to buy
more bonds than are available and said Drexel used the same
criteria for deciding how many bonds employees could purchase as it
did for its other customers.
   He said purchases by Drexel employees are closely monitored for
propriety by the firm's compliance department.
   However, Rep. Norman Lent of New York, ranking Republican on
committee, said the purchases for ``insider accounts'' appear to
violate the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the National Association of Securities Dealers.
   Joseph argued that the rules applied only to sales of stock
because bond prices are not subject to manipulation in the same way
as are prices of new stock issues.
   Lent said high-quality, investment-grade bonds are exempt from
the rules, but not the risky bonds of the type Drexel issued.
   The subcommittee released a list of 35 so-called ``insider
accounts'' owned by employees including Michael Milken, chief of
Drexel's junk bond trading unit in Beverly Hills, Calif., and
relatives of Milken.
   Also listed as having participated in the partnerships are
Dennis Levine, a former investment banker now serving a prison term
for securities law violations, and Martin Siegel, who also has
pleaded guilty to violations of securities laws.
   Both are former Drexel employees and have cooperated in
government probes of Wall Street corruption.
   Milken, in a subcommittee appearance Wednesday, cited his
constitutional protection against self-incrimination in refusing to
answer questions. He confirmed that he has been under investigation
for 18 months by a New York federal grand jury that is reported to
be probing insider trading.
   Both Drexel and Milken have denied any wrongdoing.
   Milken pioneered use of junk bonds to allow companies without a
track record of earnings to get financing based on whether they had
sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts. The bonds pay higher
interest rates than those of established companies and are
considered riskier investments.

<HEAD>Senate Vote Scuttles Immigration Amnesty Extension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief author of the nation's landmark
immigration law says illegal aliens better apply for amnesty by
next Wednesday's deadline, because a Senate vote has ended any
chance for an extension.
   ``This is it,'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said Thursday night
after helping to kill a plan that would have moved the deadline to
Nov. 30. ``This extraordinary act of grace will end May 4 when we
are in recess.''
   Those who sought to move the date back nearly seven months were
defeated when they tried to end debate by opponents of the
extension. Only 40 votes could be mustered to end the budding
filibuster, and 60 were needed.
   With the Senate adjourning today until May 9, supporters of the
extension have no chance to try to pick up another 20 votes.
   Even if the extension had passed Congress, Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, said President Reagan would have vetoed the bill as
suggested by Commissioner Alan C. Nelson of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   The House passed the amnesty extension April 21 by a 213-201
vote, indicating that a veto would have been sustained there. A
two-thirds vote is needed for an override.
   Simpson was the chief sponsor of the 1986 law passed to control
years of massive illegal immigration to the United States. The
measure had two main portions: legalization for illegal aliens who
came to the United States before Jan. 1, 1982 and have lived here
continually since then; and financial penalties for employers who
knowingly hired illegal residents.
   The aliens were given a one-year period, through May 4, to apply
for temporary residency and start down the longer road toward
permanent residency and citizenship.
   About 1.3 million applications have been received so far, and
the approval rate is running about 95 percent, according to INS
figures.
   Those who opposed the extension argued that supporters of the
change played a cruel hoax on illegal aliens by proposing
legislation that had no chance of enactment.
   Officials of the Senate Judiciary immigration subcommittee said
Thursday that people have been calling daily asking how long the
extension would last.
   Even before the vote, the INS anticipated it would be swamped as
the deadline approaches. The agency has already announced that any
alien who shows up before the deadline can file an application now
and produce the supporting documents later.
   Offices will officially be open until midnight Wednesday, and
the INS said anyone in line will be permitted to file an
application.
   Applicants have to pay a fee of $185 for individuals and $420
for a family.
   Gramm said illegal aliens who fail to beat the deadline will
``lose the opportunity to get the best gift America has _ to be in
the United States legally.''
   ``After an initial period when the law was taken seriously, the
level of illegal immigration has risen by 60 percent over the last
year,'' he said. ``When people are asked why they are coming, they
say they don't believe the law is going to be enforced.''
   Gramm added that the Border Patrol is finding a large increase
in the use of false documents by illegal aliens.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who argued for the extension,
predicted that hundreds of thousands of eligible aliens would not
apply by next Wednesday.
   ``There has been a cloud of confusion encircling this program
since its inception,'' Cranston said. ``The regulations defining
who is eligible for legalization were finalized days before the
application period opened.
   ``INS' public education campaign got off to a slow start and has
been ineffective in convincing the undocumented in certain
communities _ such as the Asian Pacific community in Los Angeles _
to come forward,'' he said.
   But Simpson, Gramm and others said the original bill was
carefully balanced between the amnesty and employer sanctions
programs, and should not be unraveled now.

   Alarmed by the growing number of latchkey
children thrust upon them, the nation's public librarians are
shelving their normally quiet roles and clamoring for better day
care and after-school programs.
   ``Librarians have to become political animals,'' says Sue
Rosenzweig of the University of North Carolina's Center for Early
Adolescence. ``We've got to take care of our kids.''
   Their pleas, along with proposed solutions, are being presented
in a 50-page policy paper today at the Public Library Association's
national conference.
   ``We're really the voice of the children,'' said Jody Stefansson
of San Marino, Calif.
   The public library's image as a safe, friendly, educational and
cost-free haven, has made it hardest hit by the growing number of
latchkey children.
   Like many children's librarians, Ms. Stefansson regularly finds
herself serving as policeman, caretaker, referee and nurse. Forty
to 60 children as young as first-graders descend upon her every
weekday afternoon, many of them instructed to do so by their
working parents.
   ``The parents think their children are really reading, and
that's the biggest myth,'' she said Thursday during the four-day
conference, which ends Saturday.
   The youngsters keep pouring in, despite Ms. Stefansson's
successful work with community groups to offer better after-school
care. She's even developed a network of babysitters for working
parents.
   ``I don't want to be a surrogate parent,'' she said.
   Noise is up and graffiti is commonplace at many libraries, say
leaders of the 6,000-member Public Library Association, a division
of the American Library Association.
   Skateboards whiz through reference rooms, bicycles clutter the
halls, flowers are trampled and parking lots are pickup and dropoff
stations.
   ``It's hard for the library to close when the parents don't get
there in time to pick up their kids,'' said Susan Goldberg,
president of the Public Library Association.
   ``What we're concerned about are those (children) who can't
leave, who are not happy being there,'' agreed Steven Herb of the
Dauphin County Library System in Harrisburg, Pa. ``We can only go
so far in trying to provide a good program, a good attitude, the
right helping hand, the smile.''
   By no means are librarians yearning for quiet, empty space.
   ``Having lots of kids in a library is something a librarian
loves. They encourage it. That's what we're there for,'' Ms.
Goldberg said. ``We're looking at the issue on the broader basis.
Can or should public libraries be day-care centers?''
   The group's policy paper, six months in the making, urges
librarians to ask community leaders and agencies to develop more
after-school programs. It will be presented to the PLA's executive
committee in May, then go before the board of directors in July for
final approval.
   While not confined to libraries, the situation ``is symptomatic
of a bigger problem'' involving child neglect and sometimes even
abuse, said Helen Blank, director of child care for the Children's
Defense Fund in Washington.
   During the early 1970s, some 30 percent of children under age 6
had a mother who worked outside the home, Ms. Blank said. Current
estimates put that figure at 54 percent, and the number is
increasing.
   Mary K. Chelton of Rockville, Md., primary author of the PLA's
policy paper, worries that latchkey children may grow up to become
adults ``who never want to see another library.'' In the meantime,
she says, they're missing out on quality time with family or
skilled child care supervisors.
   ``It's not a question of who's supposed to take care of the
kids,'' Ms. Rosenzweig said. ``It's a question of lost
opportunity.''

<HEAD>Burned Bunny Blanket Gave Birth to Playboy Empire, Hefner Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citizen Kane had his ``Rosebud,'' the
vanished childhood possession that symbolized his yearnings, and
Playboy publishing empire chieftain Hugh Hefner had his ``bunny
blanket.''
   Hefner on Thursday revealed the origin of the bunny emblem that
graces the Playboy magazine cover as he introduced the newest
``Playmate of the Year,'' 22-year-old India Allen of Hermosa Beach,
Calif.
   Miss Allen, featured in the magazine's December 1987 centerfold,
received a $60,000 sports car and a check for $100,000 as Playmate
of the Year.
   When he was ``a little kid'' one of his treasures was a blanket
``with bunnies all over it,'' Hefner said.
   ``It was what Charles Shultz in `Peanuts' calls a security
blanket,'' Hefner said. ``I called it my `bunny blanket.'''
   Part of growing up, however, included getting a dog of his own
to take care of, he said. But the dog got sick and died, Hefner
said. In fact, the dog was laid out on the blanket and the blanket
was burned.
   ``When the blanket went up in flames, the bunny empire began,''
he told the Associated Press.
   ``There was a little bit of a `Citizen Kane' phenomenon,''
Hefner said.
   In Orson Welles 1941 film classic, publisher Charles Foster Kane
was obsessed with a treasure he called ``Rosebud,'' the last word
uttered by Kane as he lay dying among his riches. Rosebud was a
sled.

<HEAD>Former Top Aide Who Sparked Controversy Keeps In Touch With The
Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Sasso, who resigned as Michael Dukakis' top
aide after embarrassing his boss with an ``attack video'' aimed at
a rival candidate, is still in contact with the Democratic
front-runner, and some predict he would have a top job in a Dukakis
White House.
   ``Mike and I are good friends, and, as he has said, we still
talk from time to time, discuss things,'' Sasso said in a brief
telephone conversation this week. ``But I have no active role with
the campaign.''
   He wouldn't say what he and Dukakis discuss, except that their
talks include campaign-related issues. He said the two have not
discussed potential running mates for Dukakis, the Democratic
front-runner.
   Aides say Sasso is in weekly contact with the candidate. Sasso,
however, has no formal role in the campaign.
   ``This is the way it has to be,'' Sasso said.
   Now working at a Boston advertising and public relations firm,
Sasso declined further comment, saying he is not granting
interviews about the campaign.
   He resigned his job as manager of the Dukakis campaign after
admitting he gave reporters a videotape that showed Democratic
rival Joseph Biden giving a speech patterned on one by British
politician Neil Kinnock, without giving Kinnock credit.
   That _ along with revelations that Biden had exaggerated his
academic record _ eventually drove the Delaware senator to drop out
of the race.
   The incident caused a furor, and became an issue in the primary
campaign. Former Democratic candidate Richard Gephardt, in a
last-ditch drive before the Super Tuesday contacts, put an ad on
the air that said, in part, ``Mike Dukakis smeared Joe Biden ...
and now he's attempting to smear Dick Gephardt.''
   Dukakis is known for his caution and aides say there has been no
discussion of bringing Sasso back into the campaign.
   If Dukakis were the Democratic nominee running against George
Bush, Sasso's presence in the campaign could hamper any Dukakis
effort to bring up the so-called ``sleaze factor'' _ the long list
of Reagan administration officials accused of wrongdoing.
   But some Dukakis aides say privately that they would not be
surprised to see Sasso back at Dukakis' side if he won the November
election, perhaps as White House chief of staff.
   Dukakis and Sasso have a long history together, and Sasso has
helped see Dukakis through some dark days. Sasso helped Dukakis
return from political exile four years after he was voted out of
the governor's office in 1978.
   Dukakis met Sasso a few days after that 1978 loss, keeping a
promise he had made to assist a referendum drive that Sasso
managed. Sasso, impressed that Dukakis had kept his word despite
the crushing defeat, offered to help Dukakis if he ever ran for
office again.
   He managed Dukakis' successful 1982 gubernatorial campaign and
became Dukakis' chief aide at the statehouse, where he was credited
with helping the governor mend fences with legislators and interest
groups alienated in his first term.
   Sasso, who took a leave from his statehouse post to manage
Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful 1984 vice presidential campaign,
was among the first to urge Dukakis to run for president. He
brought in veterans from Ferraro's staff and that of former Vice
President Walter Mondale when he assembled the Dukakis campaign.
   The ``attack video'' incident was particularly embarrassing
because it came at a time when Dukakis was urging rivals in the
then-crowded Democratic field to wage positive campaigns.
   To compound the problem, Sasso acknowledged his role in the
episide only after Dukakis said publicly he did not believe his
campaign was responsible for distributing the tapes.
   And Dukakis appeared indecisive after Sasso's admission, at
first saying he did not want to fire him. Finally, though, he
acknowledged that ``John has to go.''
   Sasso's assistant, Susan Estrich, was promoted to campaign
manager.
   Estrich, who worked with Sasso in 1984 and is a member of the
Democratic National Committee, also consults periodically with her
friend and former boss.
   ``I chat with him occassionally about how things are going,''
Estrich said. ``But I think John realizes that the strength of this
campaign is the candidate.''

<HEAD>FRA Report Cites Alcohol Use, Switch Cutoff In Train Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispatcher in charge of two Chicago and
Northwestern freight trains that collided March 21 in Illinois had
been drinking too much and automatic brakes on one train had been
shut off, the government reported today.
   The Federal Railroad Administration also said two brakemen had
tested positive for marijuana use. Three crewmen were seriously
injured in the accident, which caused $195,000 in damage.
   The accident occurred in Dixon, Ill., when a train consisting of
a locomotive and a single car headed east while a train of four
locomotives and 130 cars headed west on the same track, the FRA
said.
   The smaller, eastbound train was equipped with what is known as
``automatic train control,'' which should have stopped it when the
two entered the same signal block, the FRA said. It said the
engineer had deliberately disabled the device.
   The dispatcher had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 percent, while
the standard for intoxication in Illinois is 0.10 percent, the FRA
said. A brakeman on the eastbound train and one on the westbound
train each tested positive for marijuana, the FRA said.
   The three injured employees _ the conductor and two brakemen _
were on the larger train, the FRA said.

   Strong wind and rising tides hampered
the cleanup of a 175,000-gallon oil spill and posed a new threat to
a fragile bird sanctuary where nearly 200 oil-soaked birds and
animals have died.
   ``The good news is the oil is no longer getting out of Peyton
Slough, where 80 percent of it was trapped, but the bad news is
that what's out there in the strait and bays is going to get
swirled around a bit by nature,'' Coast Guard spokesman Dave
Zawadzki said Thursday.
   Meanwhile, a state water quality engineer speculated the size of
Shell Oil Co.'s spill may be even larger than the 175,000 gallons
estimated by the company. The spill occurred Saturday when a
drainpipe that carries off rainwater broke inside an oil tank,
allowing oil to be siphoned out.
   So far workers have recovered some 126,000 gallons of the San
Joaquin crude, a particularly thick oil, from the area 40 miles
northeast of San Francisco, the Coast Guard said.
   Because much of the oil remains in Peyton Slough and nearby
marshes, Kazemi Hossain, an engineer with the state Regional Water
Quality Control board, told reporters he expects Shell ``will
revise upwards their spill estimate, after we do our own
calculations.''
   Earlier Thursday, westerly winds up to 25 mph and increasingly
higher tides pushed up to 1,600 gallons of oil out of remote
sloughs into the Carquinez Strait and into still more waterfowl
nesting areas. Similar gusts were expected today, National Weather
Service forecasters said.
   By the weekend, easterly winds and exceptionally high weekend
tides _ peaking about 5 feet _ are likely to send still more oil
into uncontaminated areas, Zawadzki said.
   Eight skimmer boats on Thursday began removing new oil-sheen
patches stretching six miles from Martinez Marina, where 400 boats
were trapped in the oily harbor, to Ryer Island, where the the oil
got into nesting areas.
   Some 450 oily waterfowl and animals have been recovered. Of
those, 192 have died or were dead when discovered, according to
Brian Hunter, regional manager of the state Fish and Game
Department.
   The Coast Guard advised sport fishing and recreational boats
owners to stay out of Suisun Bay over the weekend, where several
oil sheens were spotted. The bay is about 40 miles northeast of San
Francisco.
   Boat skippers, many of whom make a living by taking out weekend
parties of sports fishermen, were upset they would not be allowed
out to sea Sunday for the opening of the salmon season. They also
could not leave the marina for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
where steelhead trout are approaching the peak of their spawning
season.
   ``This is going to be a big blow to a lot of old timers around
here because they count on getting out to sea and getting a good
catch early in the season when they can get the best price,'' said
Angelo Torliano, 74, whose son operates a family fishing business.

<HEAD>Railroad Car Shortage Hampers Grain Shipments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robust export demand and failure to add to the
fleet since 1982 have caused a shortage of railroad cars to move
wheat and corn, says a transportation official with the Agriculture
Department.
   Although the car shortages appear to have eased in recent days,
steps need to be taken to avoid a repetition of the crunch that
occurred earlier this year, Martin Fitzpatrick Jr., head of the
department's Office of Transportation, said Thursday.
   Fitzpatrick also defended USDA export policies and programs
which have helped trigger a rebound in farm commodity exports.
   A study released by Fitzpatrick showed a severe disruption of
grain shipments in the United States this year through mid-April
because of shortages of covered hopper cars used by railroads.
   The study was requested by Reps. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., and
Virginia Smith, R-Neb. Fitzpatrick said he planned to cite the
study further at a hearing on Monday, May 2, in Kansas City, Mo.,
conducted by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.
   Fitzpatrick said the actual number of cars available for grain
movement has been both shrinking and aging since 1982 when the last
significant number was added to the railroad fleet.
   Also, there has been a large surge in export wheat sales under
the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, during the
past few months. Big sales to the Soviet Union, in particular, have
added to the railroad grain traffic.
   Under EEP, exporters can sell wheat or other designated
commodities to an approved foreign country at reduced prices and
then collect subsidies from USDA in the form of government-owned
surplus grain or other agricultural products.
   Fitzpatrick said car shortages meant some local elevators were
unable to take delivery of grain from farmers, grain merchants had
difficulty completing sales, and railroads hiked rates and
restricted use of cars in certain markets.
   Also, he said, the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
``received limited response'' to its weekly auctions of surplus
wheat because of the car shortages.
   Fitzpatrick was asked by a reporter whether the rail car
shortages had interfered with shipments of grain to seaports to the
extent that ships were kept waiting for grain to load.
   ``We do not believe that to be the case, as a general rule,'' he
said. But there may have been ``some specific circumstances'' what
that happened in the last six months. ``It's not a trend, it is not
a significant problem down the road,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   Although reasons are not clear why the hopper car situation has
improved the last 10 days, Fitzpatrick noted that export demand has
slackened somewhat and delivery dates have eased. Also, he said,
railroads had received overbookings for cars from grain companies,
and many of those now are being reconciled.
   Fitzpatrick said that it will take pressure from Congress, farm
groups, the grain trade and USDA to settle the rail car situation.
Ideally, he said, shippers and the railroads should sit down under
auspices of the Interstate Commerce Commission and resolve the
problems.
   The ICC, he said, has the authority to force a settlement.
Fitzpatrick was asked if he thought the ICC was dragging its feet.
   ``All I would say to you is the ICC has full authority to
resolve this issue,'' he said. ``It's been almost six years that
they have had it on their table, so you draw your own conclusion.''

   Farm policy could be improved worldwide by
making government support to farmers independent of acreage and
production levels, says the National Center for Food and
Agricultural Policy.
   This policy of decoupling would lead to ``more efficient
production of agricultural goods and lower production costs when
compared to current farm policies,'' the center reported Thursday.
   Some form of decoupling for American farmers has been advocated
unsuccessfully in Congress for a number of years. One example would
be to sign up farmers in a crop program and provide benefits
without tying them to specific acreage or production levels.
   As defined by the center _ a part of the independent, non-profit
Washington-based think tank, Resources for the Future _ decoupling
would mean ``providing government support to farmers in ways that
do not distort production, prices, consumption, resource allocation
or trade.''
   Decoupling doesn't set well with some farm groups. The National
Farmers Union, for example, says it is tantamount to putting
farmers on welfare by substituting direct federal payments for
price supports.
   A statement issued by NFU at its recent annual convention said:
``Farmers want federal program payments to help recover their cost
of producing food. These payments are actually subsidies to
consumers that pass through the hands of farmers.''

   Two ballets with music composed by Pulitzer
Prize-winners for the New York City Ballet's American Music
Festival were premiered this week at the New York State Theater.
   Charles Wuorinen, who won the Pulitzer for music in 1970,
conducted Thursday night's premiere of his ``Five,'' written for
cello and orchestra. Cello soloist Fred Sherry's part was often
spiky, without obvious melody or beat, but always listenable.
   Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, a member of the New York City Ballet from
1970 to '80 and chairman of Indiana University's dance department
since 1985, choreographed in neo-classic style.
   He has his men in gray and women in silver-gray and he moves
them in diagonal patterns and wedge shapes. When Jock Soto lifted
Maria Calegari, she seemed to float. Michael Byars and Damian
Woetzel had some high jumping and several times danced with seven
women around them.
   Wednesday night saw the premiere of ``Tanzspiel'' by Ellen
Taaffe Zwilich, who won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1983. The
company's co-ballet master in chief Peter Martins choreographed.
   This plotless dance lacked that inner pulse that makes one
movement seem to follow another logically.
   ``Tanzspiel'' had some lovely romantic dancing for Kyra Nichols
and Lindsay Fischer. Martins proved again that he knows how to fill
a stage with dancers. But ``Tanzspiel'' doesn't flow. The music is
ominous much of the time and Fischer often has grim movements in
dim light. There were exits where applause obviously was expected
but there wasn't any.
   Also Wednesday, the company beautifully danced ``Glass Pieces''
choreographed by Jerome Robbins to Philip Glass. ``Glass Pieces''
makes a better impression with each viewing. Miss Nichols and Soto
danced with superlative virtuosity in ``Stars and Stripes,'' George
Balanchine's choreography to John Philip Sousa.
   Thursday's program began with ``Jubilee!'' danced by fresh,
proficient students at the School of American Ballet. Joseph
Duell's choreography to Hershy Kay's music was charming but
repetitious; he should have used less of the music.
   ``Calcium Light Night'' is a series of dazzling modern solos
choreographed by Martins in 1977 to music by Charles Ives. Soto and
Heather Watts were the impressive performers. The evening ended
with the dazzling Darci Kistler and Robert LaFosse, convincing as a
tapdancer, starring in Balanchine's dance to Richard Rodgers'
``Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.''

<HEAD>State Can't Pay Mecham Impeachment Expenses Without New Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Arizona's attorney general said Thursday
that the state cannot pay former Gov. Evan Mecham's $200,000 legal
bill from his impeachment trial without a new law authorizing such
action.
   Legislators said Thursday they almost certainly will not pass
such a law.
   A spokeswoman in Mecham's office said the former Republican
governor would not comment on the non-binding opinion issued by
Attorney General Bob Corbin, also a Republican, until Mecham and
his lawyers had a chance to review it.
   Two days after Mecham's removal April 4 in a Senate impeachment
trial, the Senate voted 16-13 to pay $202,433 to his attorneys,
Fred Craft and Jerris Leonard. At the time, supporters said it was
a ``healing'' gesture.
   But state Treasurer Ray Rottas balked at writing the check and
asked Corbin for an opinion on whether the payment was permitted.
   ``There is no authority to pay Evan Mecham's costs and
attorneys' fees,'' Corbin concluded. However, he told reporters
that the state could pay Mecham's expenses if a new law were passed
to authorize it.
   ``We are not going to pass, in my estimation, anything in either
house,'' said GOP Sen. John Mawhinney.
   House Speaker Joe Lane, also a Republican, said House
Republicans were not enthusiastic about paying either the legal
fees or Mecham's recall expenses.
   The former governor has asked the state to pay him $231,000 for
his campaign costs before a May 17 recall vote aimed at his removal
was canceled.
   Mecham was convicted by the Senate of trying to thwart a death
threat investigation and misusing $80,000 by loaning it to his auto
dealership. He faces a criminal trial May 19 on charges of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.

   The House and Senate appeared headed for a
fight over arms control restrictions opposed by President Reagan as
the two Democratic-controlled chambers work on versions of a
Pentagon budget bill.
   The House voted Thursday to ban all but the smallest U.S.
nuclear tests, the third restriction approved in two days as the
chamber works on its version of a defense bill.
   But the Senate Armed Services Committee, which finished work
Thursday on its version, includes only one restriction that Reagan
doesn't want.
   That would ban any Star Wars tests that violate the narrow
interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   That limit was approved by the House, along with the restriction
on most nuclear tests, and a prohibition against any nuclear
weapons that violate the numerical limits in the unratified SALT II
nuclear arms treaty. Neither of the last two is in the Senate
measure.
   When the two bills are passed separately by the House and
Senate, they will be sent to a House-Senate conference committee to
reconcile differences.
   ``In some ways, we're more liberal than the Senate, or at least
the liberals are more powerful here,'' explained Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Both bills authorize Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion in the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1. That was the total set last December
in the ``budget summit'' between Congress and Reagan to reduce the
federal budget deficit.
   The total was $33 billion less than the Pentagon had originally
thought it would receive in the next fiscal year. To meet the lower
figure, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci ordered cuts in manpower,
along with the early retirement of 16 Navy frigates.
   ``He took some tough decisions and made hard choices and we
supported him in our budget,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Aspin agreed. ``Carlucci made a lot of tough choices and that's
why the Pentagon fared pretty well in our committee. We didn't cut
much.''
   On Thursday, the House:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Voted 214-186 to ban all underground nuclear tests of weapons
larger than one kiloton. The decision came after the House passed,
399-0, a Republican-backed amendment praising Reagan's effort to
negotiate limits on testing.
   A similar ban was also approved a year ago by the House, but was
dropped by the House-Senate conference committee and ended up as
only an advisory request.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said ``we owe it to our children''
to vigorously pursue a total ban on all atomic tests. But Rep.
William Broomfield, R-Mich., said the restriction would ``totally
undercut our negotiators.'' He referred to ongoing U.S.-Soviet
talks.
   _Voted down, 205-197, an anti-satellite (ASAT) ban which was
proposed for a fourth year. But the panel also turned down,
212-195, a proposal to spend $100 million for development of a
ground-based anti-satellite weapon.
   The ASAT limit had been imposed by Congress the past three years
and the Pentagon responded by dropping work on the program to
develop an ASAT weapon fired from a high-flying F-15 jet. The Air
Force is now working on different types of ASATs, particularly
those using ground-based lasers.
   Another difference between the two bills is over how much to
authorize for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is
formally known.
   The Senate panel recommended $4.6 billion for SDI. The House
bill provides $4.0 billion, although that figure may change when
the issue is debated next week on the floor.
   Currently, SDI receives $3.9 billion and Reagan had sought $4.8
billion for the next fiscal year.

<TEXT>
   A Justice Department official denies he tried
to taint the Iran-Contra investigation by pressing congressional
testimony about the shredding of sensitive documents on an
investigator for independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   In a letter to Walsh, William Bradford Reynolds said Thursday
his ``fleeting reference'' to the immunized congressional testimony
of fired National Security Council aide Oliver North in front of
one of Walsh's investigators was ``wholly inadvertent.''
   Reynolds did not identify the testimony, but Justice Department
sources say it concerns North's statements that he shredded
sensitive documents in the presence of Reynolds and another aide to
Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Reynolds has publicly denied that
portion of North's testimony.
   Reynolds said the mention of North's testimony was prompted by a
question from the investigator, Judith Hetherton, an associate
counsel on the independent counsel's staff.
   In testimony that Reynolds wrote he was ``startled to read,''
Walsh said in federal court Wednesday at the pre-trial taint
hearing in the Iran-Contra scandal that Hetherton had to use
``forceful'' language to cut off Reynolds as he started to relate
some of North's testimony.
   ``She really had to be energetic to get him to stop,'' testified
Walsh.
   Reynolds flatly rejected Walsh's characterization.
   The exchange with Hetherton took a minute or two in normal
conversational tones and ``neither of us interrupted ... neither
her language nor mine ever approached being `forceful' or even
remotely impolite,'' Reynolds said in the letter.
   ``The fact is that my fleeting reference to something that came
up'' during North's congressional testimony last summer was in
response to a question by Hetherton just before Reynolds'
subsequent grand jury appearance, Reynolds wrote.
   ``As soon as I answered, she advised me that I should not
discuss with her or the grand jury any immunized congressional
testimony and I instantly apologized, assuring her that my
reference had been wholly inadvertent,'' said Reynolds, the
counselor to Meese.
   By law, Walsh must convince the judge in the case that the
indictments of North and three others was obtained independently of
immunized congressional testimony.
   North and two of the defendants in the case are trying to use
their immunity grants as a way of getting the indictments
dismissed. North, former national security adviser John Poindexter,
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Albert Hakim,
Secord's business partner, are under indictment for conspiracy,
theft and fraud charges.
   James Wieghart, a spokesman for Walsh, had no comment on
Reynolds' letter.
   North testified that he shredded sensitive documents while
Reynolds and another Meese aide, then-chief of staff John
Richardson, were in North's office reviewing his files during a
weekend inquiry in November 1986.
   The inquiry led to the uncovering of the diversion to the
Contras of money from the Reagan administration's secret arms sales
to Iran. North's testimony raised the suggestion of incompetence by
the attorney general's staff or of a possible cover-up to which
Meese's staff acquiesced.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Accuses Quaker Oats of Misleading Health Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group contends that Quaker Oats Co.
advertisements overstate the benefit of the company's cereal
products in reducing the risk of heart attacks.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest filed a complaint
Thursday seeking a Federal Trade Commission order to halt a
magazine advertising campaign for Quaker Oats and Oat Bran.
   A Quaker spokesman said the company has ample evidence to
support its claim that eating oat cereal helps reduce cholesterol,
a major cause of heart disease.
   ``Scientific research documents the effect that oats can have,''
spokesman Ron Bottrell said. ``We're confident with the claims that
have been made.''
   The ads, which feature actor Wilford Brimley, recommend lowering
fat intake and adding complex carbohydrates and fiber to the diet.
   The center objected to one section saying that clinical studies
show serum-cholesterol dropped an average of nearly 10 percent
among people who ate Quaker Oats daily as part of a low-fat,
low-cholesterol diet.
   ``Quaker is grossly exaggerating,'' said Bruce Silverglade,
legal director for the non-profit advocacy group. ``The Brimley ads
make the reader believe that Quaker Oats are some type of magic
wand.
   ``In fact, most of the improvement in the health of individuals
who eat Quaker Oats was due to also eating a low-fat,
low-cholesterol diet.''
   He said oat cereal, by itself, accounted for only a 3 percent
cholesterol reduction and a corresponding decline of 6 percent in
the risk of heart disease, ``a modest to minimal improvement ... of
borderline significance.''
   A heart-disease specialist at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in Bethesda, Md., said he had not seen the ads and did
not want to take sides.
   ``Nobody would get too excited if you reduced the risk by that
amount,'' Dr. Basil Rifkind said. ``On the other hand, if you look
at it in population terms, we usually say that even small
reductions in cholesterol could be meaningful.''
   Commission spokeswoman Dee Ellison said the FTC had no immediate
comment on the complaint.

<HEAD>Red Cross Survey Finds Potential New Threat In Donated Blood</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross is ``right on target''
with plans to start testing donated blood for a rare virus linked
to a vicious form of adult leukemia, says the National Cancer
Institute researcher who first discovered the virus.
   Dr. Robert Gallo, a scientist credited with discovering the
human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, or HTLV-1, said the nation's
blood supply should be tested to protect future generations from
the slow-acting but dangerous virus.
   In a Science magazine report published today, Red Cross
scientist recommended that blood donated across the country should
be tested for the HTLV-1 virus as soon as a practical test be
developed. The recommendation was made after a Red Cross survey
found 10 units infected with the virus out of 39,898 units tested.
   ``I think there are as many people infected with this virus as
are infected with the AIDS virus,'' Gallo said.
   Alan E. Williams, a research scientist at the Red Cross
laboratory in Rockville, Md., said his research team estimates that
the risk of becoming infected with the HTLV-1 leukemia virus is
about 2,800 in 12 million, or about 1 chance in 4,286 for every
unit of blood transfused annually.
   ``The danger is minimal but not insignificant,'' Williams said.
   For that reason, he said, the Red Cross ``wants to take an
active stance to keep the situation from getting worse, as it
possibly could.''
   Williams said current methods of testing donated blood for the
virus take up to three days and a more practical test must be
developed before HTLV-1 screening can begin.
   He said at least three drug companies, which he declined to
name, are trying to develop screening tests, but these are months
from possible approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
   The NCI researcher discovered and identified the HTLV-1 virus in
1978. Gallo said his understanding of HTLV-1, a retrovirus that
takes over genetic control of cells it attacks, led him to look for
a retrovirus as the cause of AIDS. He is credited as co-discoverer
of the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
   Gallo said HTLV-1 may be rare in the continental United States,
but it is endemic in parts of Europe, Alaska, Africa and the Orient.
   ``In time, due to increased travel and increased sexual contact,
these kinds of virus are all increasing (in the continental
U.S.),'' said Gallo. Because HTLV-1 has a long latent period before
it causes disease, he said, ``it is not as readily seen as AIDS,
but our children and our children's children will see it if we
don't start eliminating it from the blood supply.''
   Gallo added, ``I'm very glad to see the way the Red Cross has
responded.''
   Dr. Edward Murphy, a National Cancer Institute researcher who
has studied the HTLV-1 virus extensively, said it is linked to
adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, a type of blood cancer usually
fatal within six months.
   Another disease closely linked to the virus, said Murphy, is
tropical spastic paraparesis, in which the virus attacks nerve
cells that control the lower extremities and causes paralysis and
eventually death.
   The incubation period for expression of the leukemia is thought
to be 30 years or more, but people exposed to the virus become
infectious within two weeks to six months, said Murphy. Incubation
for paraparesis is slightly shorter.
   The virus can be spread in ways similar to the AIDS virus: by
sexual contact or the exchange of body fluids such as by sharing
drug needles. HTLV-1 also is thought to be spread through mother's
milk, said Murphy.
   Williams said the Red Cross survey checked for HTLV-1 in samples
from eight different blood banks. Blood donors who tested positive
for the virus were found in Atlanta, Washington, Birmingham, Ala.
and Los Angeles.
   Blood also was tested in St. Paul, Minn., Portland, Ore.,
Baltimore and Miami, but no HTLV-1 was found.
   Though the positive tests totaled only 10 out of more than
39,000 samples tested, Williams said, ``a highly selective group''
was used. ``They go through several levels (of screening) before
the blood is ever drawn,'' he said.

   The setting matched the subject as President
Reagan honored the beautification efforts of Lady Bird Johnson,
awarding the former first lady a congressional gold medal at a
glittering White House ceremony.
   Under chandeliers that cast prisms of light across the East
Room, Reagan hailed Mrs. Johnson for ``an impressive career in her
own right.''
   ``Her concern for the poor and underprivileged helped inspire a
nation; her efforts to beautify America continuing up to today
still blossom in our nation's capital and beside our highways,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Johnson said that 20 years ago, when her husband, Lyndon B.
Johnson, decided not to seek re-election and the family left the
White House, she never imagined she would be back in the capital
under such circumstances.
   It was, she said, the furthest thought from her mind.
   But Thursday, the wealthy, the powerful and the famous turned
out in force to honor the 75-year-old Texan for filling the
capital's traffic circles with tulips and lining ribbons of
concrete highway with evening primroses, Indian paintbrushes and
other native wildflowers.
   ``For all of us here at the White House and on Capitol Hill,
welcome back, Lady Bird, it's good to have you home,'' Reagan said.
In the audience were executives and politicians and men who once
were members of Johnson's inner circle.
   Earlier in the day, the Senate paid tribute and the House
overflowed with well-wishers as both presented Mrs. Johnson with
resolutions honoring her good works. Speeches recalled her lifelong
love of nature and her ability to inspire the rest of the nation to
treasure its natural heritage.
   ``Mrs. Johnson has painted the landscape with daffodils, tulips
and wildflowers; but she has also beautified America with the magic
of her presence, the gentleness of her touch and her compassion for
our people,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a fellow Texan and Democrat.
   Surrounded by her daughters, their husbands and children, Mrs.
Johnson blew kisses from the Senate gallery after passage of the
resolution honoring her.
   Mrs. Johnson had a few thanks herself _ for the president for
taking time out of a busy schedule, and for the country.
   The honor, she said, was a great day for her, but also ``a
salute to all those people all over this great land who are working
to preserve and to enhance the natural beauty of America.''

   The executor for Liberace's estate said
he authorized the marketing of a ceramic decanter in the late
entertainer's image and a dog calendar to capitalize on Liberace's
name after his death.
   ``Since Mr. Liberace loved dogs I thought it would be a good
idea for his fans to have a dog calendar. So we made a deal,'' Joel
Strote testified Thursday in a civil lawsuit filed by five Liberace
associates seeking to remove Strote as executor of an estate valued
as high as $20 million.
   Strote, a Beverly Hills lawyer, said he agreed to market the
items so that more money could be made for the Liberace Foundation
for the Performing Arts, which provides scholarships for students
at 22 colleges.
   In addition, Strote said that in February 1987 he conceived the
idea of an auction of Liberace memorabilia. Liberace died Feb. 5,
1987, of complications from AIDS.
   ``I wanted to strike while the iron was hot,'' he said. ``If I
could help make this auction a fabulous event, the foundation would
gain worldwide attention.''
   The auction in Los Angeles earlier this month grossed slightly
over $2 million and featured furnishings and memorabilia from
Liberace homes in New York City's Trump Tower, Las Vegas, Los
Angeles, Palm Springs and Lake Tahoe.
   The state civil suit was filed by the entertainer's sister,
Angie Liberace, Seymour Heller, his manager for 37 years,
housekeepers Dorothy McMahon and Gladys Luckie, and Cary James,
Liberace's companion for seven years.
   The five charge that Strote drew up a will and trust agreements
with Liberace, then had him sign them 13 days before his death.
Strote contends Liberace was well enough to know what he was doing,
but the entertainer's former nurse disputed that contention in
testimony Wednesday.
   Strote said Tuesday that his firm had been paid about $400,000
from the estate in a 13-month period, and that he would be paid his
normal retainer while involved in the current case.
   The attorney for the plaintiffs, Harold Gewerter, complained
Thursday that Strote's attorneys were dragging out the current
hearing while Strote was being paid $250 an hour as a witness.

   A 20-year-old drug available without
prescription in Mexico and Japan puts up a strong fight against the
AIDS virus in laboratory tests, but a National Cancer Institute
researcher says the finding ``is not a breakthrough.''
   The drug, called dextran sulfate, was found to prevent the AIDS
virus from infecting and killing the body's T-cell lymphocytes, the
main target of the virus, researchers say in a Science article
published today.
   But Dr. Samuel Broder of NCI, one of the co-authors of the
research paper, said in an interview that much still remains to be
learned about the drug before it could possibly be used to treat
AIDS.
   ``This is not a breakthrough,'' said Broder. He said that though
the drug ``is a potent agent'' against the AIDS virus in a test
tube, it is not clear that the drug can be given to patients in
strong enough doses to affect the course of the disease.
   ``We found in the test tube that this agent is a very a powerful
inhibitor of the HIV virus,'' said Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal, a NCI
researcher and co-author of a study on dextran sulfate. HIV, for
human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   Dr. Wong-Staal said the drug has been used for more than two
decades in Japan and elsewhere as an anticoagulant and has
demonstrated that it has no significant toxicity.
   Broder said dextran sulfate is only one of a large family of
potential anti-virals that must first undergo carefully controlled
trials.
   Dr. Robert Gallo, an NCI researcher and co-discoverer of the
AIDS virus, said dextran sulfate should be studied further.
   ``I'm impressed by the results I've seen in vitro and it merits
trials (in patients),'' he said. ``The question is will it be able
to be taken by patients for long periods of time.''
   A spokesman at NCI said dextran sulfate now is in clinical
trials at San Francisco General Hospital and results from the tests
are expected to be announced at an international AIDS meeting in
Stockholm in June.
   Dr. Wong-Staal said the drug prevents the HIV virus from
invading the T-cell lymphocytes, a type of immunity cell that the
AIDS virus normally attacks.
   Usually the HIV virus attacks the T-cells by first attaching to
a receptor, a type of protein, on the cell's outer layer or
envelope. In the test tube studies, dextran sulfate was found
effective in preventing the virus from binding to the cell
envelope, thus preventing it from invading and killing the cell.
   Untreated, HIV will change the genetic pattern of the T-cell and
force it to start making copies of the virus. But this cannot take
place if the virus cannot invade the cell.
   The drug was first formulated by the Uneo Fine Chemical Industry
of Osaka, Japan. It was used for decades to treat blood clots, but
has not been approved for that use in the United States by the Food
and Drug Administration. The drug can be purchased routinely over
the counter in Mexico and in Japan, however.
   Last May, the FDA approved the drug for use in limited clinical
trials in San Francisco, and Uneo now holds a patent for its use
against AIDS.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact
with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.
   The chief victims of AIDS in the United States have been
homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small
percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated
blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women
to their offspring.
   As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500
Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since
June 1981, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
   A ban on plastic handguns that could slip past
metal detectors and X-rays will stop a major security problem
before it starts, says the chairman of the House committee that
cleared such a gun-control measure.
   ``Plastic firearms cannot be detected at security checkpoints
when subject to inspection by metal detectors and they do not
generate a distinct X-ray image,'' Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D-N.J., said. ``Consequently, plastic firearms offer the potential
terrorist a window of opportunity and pose a serious threat to the
public safety of all Americans.''
   On Thursday, Rodino's committee approved, by voice vote,
legislation sponsored by Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., to ban the
manufacture, sale or possession of undetectable plastic firearms.
   The approval came after the panel defeated 23-12 an amendment by
Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., that would have led to the death
penalty for anyone using a so-called ``plastic gun'' in the
commission of a crime.
   Law enforcement agencies and gun control groups have been
lobbying intensely for standards that would prevent terrorists from
concealing plastic guns and slipping them past detectors.
   No plastic gun has been manufactured, but a Florida company has
a patent on one that it has said it will manufacture for law
enforcement agencies in about two years.
   Hughes, chairman of the Judiciary crime subcommittee, said the
legislation will not affect existing firearms but takes aim at a
new generation of plastic firearms experts believe will be
developed and perfected in the near future.
   ``This legislation is a fair and reasonable attempt to head off
a serious law enforcement problem before it happens,'' said Hughes.
``It's apparent that plastic guns would become the weapons of
choice for terrorists and other criminals if they became
available.''
   Under the bill, guns must contain at least 3.7 ounces of
electronically detectable metal to make sure they can be picked up
by magnetometer devices. It also requires that firearm components
generate accurate X-ray images to assist in their detection.
   The bill makes it a federal offense to knowingly manufacture,
import, sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm. It sets fines
of up to $250,000 for individuals and $1 million for organizations,
and up to five years in jail.
   The legislation is similar to one agreed to by the Justice
Department, law enforcement groups and the National Rifle
Association which has opposed any changes in the law. That measure
is expected to see quick passage in the Senate.
   Mary Kaaren Jolly, NRA federal liaison, applauded the House
Judiciary action, saying, ``We think it is the best piece of
legislation introduced to date in either the House or Senate side.''

   Last fall's deficit-reduction agreement was
supposed to make this an easy year for passing a budget, but the
House and Senate have managed to get in an argument anyway.
   Talks between the chambers on a compromise $1.1 trillion
spending plan collapsed Thursday amid angry accusations of
bad-faith negotiating.
   ``That which I fear the worst has befallen me,'' said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., who is retiring
after this year, citing ``burnout'' from his three terms.
   Chiles blasted House negotiators for sending an offer on the
fiscal 1989 spending plan not ``in the spirit of what we sent
you.'' He told the House, in colorful words usually impolite in
public meetings, it should not expect a response and should come
back with a new proposal.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the House budget chairman, took
offense.
   ``I'm not going to sit here and be told, `If you don't like what
we offered, then lump it,''' he said.
   Gray offered to negotiate through the weekend, but Chiles said
he was heading back to Florida for next week, when the Senate is on
recess.
   ``When the House makes an offer that moves as far to the Senate
as the Senate did to the House, send it to me by wire and I'll come
back,'' he told Gray.
   Another meeting was set for May 9 but Chiles warned: ``We'd
better get on our seersucker suits and turn on the air
conditioning. I think we're going into summer.''
   Last fall's deficit-reduction pact between President Reagan and
congressional leaders laid down the outlines for the budget for the
spending year beginning next Oct. 1. It settled what is usually the
biggest fight _ ``guns versus butter'' _ by providing specific
figures for overall military, foreign aid and domestic spending.
   The budgets approved by the House and Senate, however, took
slightly different approaches toward the domestic budget.
   For example, the Senate, led by Chiles, approved a bigger
increase in the space program, which is well-represented in his
home state. The House has refused to go along, favoring more
spending on housing and poverty programs.
   Another issue is a Senate plan to alter the White House
agreement to add more drug-fighting money. House members oppose
breaking the summit pact for drugs alone, and not aid for the
homeless and other needs.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the
Senate panel, said House ``nitpicking'' was threatening to ``make
an absolute joke out of this process.''
   ``We were supposed to have a year where the (budget) summit made
it easy,'' he said. Now, he said, ``we're about to destroy it.''
   The House and Senate must compromise on the budget before it
becomes the official guide for Congress' annual spending bills.
   Congress missed its April 15 deadline for completing the budget
resolution. If one isn't approved by the middle of next month the
two chambers will begin passing their spending bills without one.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., a budget committee member, urged
that heads remain cool and emphasized that differences were not
great.
   ``All we've got to do is agree to have an easy time'' he said.

   A newly updated hymnal for United Methodists
has won preliminary approval at the church's governing general
conference _ except for some missing masculine pronouns about God.
   The objections arose over phrases in the accompanying psalter of
psalms, not the hymns themselves.
   Noting that in many cases masculine personal pronouns, such as
``he'' and ``him'' had been replaced by ``God'' or ``God's,'' the
Rev. Riley Case of Marion, Indiana, said:
   ``The truth is that this proposed psalter has no pronouns for
God. It is a depersonalized God. And the feeling in the trenches
will be that the Bible has been changed.''
   Harriett Olson of Morristown, N.J., countered that ``removing
pronouns is not depersonalizing God. It's calling God by God's
name.''
   The issue arose in a hearing Thursday of a legislative
committee. It voted to asked the conference to restore masculine
pronouns in 34 psalms in a lengthy section of them.
   The proposed hymnbook generally got the committee's solid
backing, including the hymns and accompanying prayers, readings and
rituals for communion, baptism, marriage and other observance.
   The conference, the top governing body of about 10 million
members, is concentrating in its early stages on committee
hearings, with most proposed legislation to hit the floor next week.
   Action on the hymnbook may come as early as Saturday by the 996
delegates, half clergy and half laity. The delegates represent the
country's second largest Protestant denomination, next to Southern
Baptists.
   The committee recommended replacing only one of the 624 proposed
hymns, asking that ``Lord of the Dance'' be substituted for ``Awake
O Sleeper.''
   Work on the new hymnbook, revising a 1966 edition, has gone on
for four years and involved Methodists around the country.
Grassroots reaction sometimes toppled committee decisions.
   The new book preserves 329 hymns from the old book, and includes
295 new ones. The lyrics, while using inclusive sexual terms for
people, retains customary masculine pronouns for God.
   But the section of psalms in some cases didn't do so, which
provoked the call for restoration.
   For instance, as in Psalm 46:6, the committee didn't like the
proposed phrase, ``God's voice resounds,'' in place of the usage in
the new Revised Standard Version of the Bible, ``He utters his
voice.''
   Masculine descriptions of God also is an issue in other matters
before the conference, including proposals to allow substitution of
``Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer'' for the traditional usage,
``Father, Son and Holy Spirit.''
   The conference has scheduled action Monday on controversial
proposals to eliminate stands terming homosexual practice
``incompatible with Christian teaching'' and banning active
homosexuals from the ministry.
   Criticizing the focus on homosexuality, Eric St. Clarke,
president of the Carribbean Council of Churches, said, ``There is
no talk about heterosexual sins. Why? Is there nothing else going
on in the church.''

   People who complain about their lawyers are
out of luck in most states if they expect help from the agency that
is supposed to regulate the profession, a legal reform group says.
   A ``report card'' issued Thursday by HALT, a consumer advocacy
organization campaigning to reform the attorney discipline process,
gave most states surveyed an ``F'' in policing lawyers.
   ``Nobody is doing a good job _ the question is how bad,'' Kay
Ostberg, HALT's director of research and education, said at news
conference.
   But the American Bar Association, which says it also is working
for reforms, insists there have been improvements in recent years.
   ``I would say that most of the states are doing a reasonably
good job given the resources they have,'' said the ABA's Timothy
McPike, who handles matters involving professional standards.
   HALT says disciplinary agencies often have a conflict of
interest because they are run by lawyers and because the
disciplinary process itself is mired in secrecy. In many states,
the public never learns which lawyers are being investigated or the
outcome of the probe.
   The most common complaints are of excessive legal fees or an
attorney's neglect. Ms. Ostberg said disciplinary agencies don't
usually act unless the offense is shown to be excessive.
   She cited a 1986 ABA survey of 40 states which found that 54,605
complaints were received but only 1,146 or 2 percent resulted in
any form of public discipline. Ninety-five percent were dismissed
without any discipline.
   McPike says those numbers reflect that many complaints are not
serious enough to warrant action.
   ``Ninety percent of the complaints don't even make it past the
first screening. People complain because their lawyer didn't answer
their phone call fast enough,'' he said. ``You have to have a good,
strong case before you can take somebody's license from them.''
   HALT proposed speeding up the process of dealing with
complaints, opening records to the public and having non-lawyers
serve on independent commissions to monitor and investigate
complaints.
   McPike said that in 1985, the most recent year for which figures
are available, 20 states made disciplinary proceedings public after
it was determined there was probable cause to warrant the filing of
charges. Thirty-three states have non-lawyers serving on
disciplinary boards, he said.
   Complaints are handled on the state level by organizations
operated under the state's highest court. These organizations are
run as arms of state bar associations or as separate disciplinary
governing boards.
   The HALT survey, conducted during February and March, graded
disciplinary agencies in five categories: whether the agency is
subject to public review or control, allows public access to its
proceedings, makes disciplinary records public, encourages the
filing of complaints and has a ``fair and responsive'' disciplinary
process.
   Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia responded to
the survey. The rest of the states did not respond.
   HALT gave each state that responded a ``final grade'' based on
the five criteria:
   Alaska, D; Arkansas, F; California, D+; Colorado, F;
Connecticut, D; District of Columbia, F; Florida, F; Hawaii, F;
Idaho, F; Illinois, F; Kentucky, F; Maryland, D; Massachusetts, F;
Minnesota, D; Mississippi, F; Missouri, F; Montana, F; Nevada, F;
New Jersey, F; New Mexico, F; North Carolina, F; Ohio, F; Oregon,
C; Pennsylvania, F; Rhode Island, F; South Carolina, F; Tennessee,
F; Texas, F; Utah, F; Vermont, F; Virginia, F; Washington, C-;

<HEAD>FAA: No `Grossly Unsafe' Planes at Eastern, Continental</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX8</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities in more than 2,000
inspections of Eastern and Continental airlines jets have so far
found no ``grossly unsafe'' aircraft, according to the chief of the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said Thursday that 5 percent of
the inspections uncovered ``minor'' safety infractions that
required planes to be taken out of service and at times flights to
be delayed.
   He characterized the percentage as not unusually high.
   The FAA began its plane-by-plane inspections April 13 and
McArtor said they will continue through mid-May.
   Both airlines are owned by the Houston-based Texas Air Corp.,
the country's largest airline company, which also is under a
special review by the federal government.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said his department's
separate inspection of Texas Air's management and financial
practices is half completed and ``everything is going very well.''
Burnley did not elaborate on any of the findings so far.
   Burnley and McArtor met with reporters to announce a series of
organizational changes at the FAA aimed primarily at giving the
agency's Washington headquarters more control over its regional
offices.
   But many of the questions turned to the probes of Texas Air and
its two airline subsidiaries.
   McArtor said there have been about 1,000 aircraft inspections at
Eastern and about the same number at Continental, with many planes
subjected to inspections more than once at different airports. The
two airlines together have about 580 planes.
   In ``roughly 7 to 8 percent'' of the inspections at Eastern and
3 percent of the inspections at Continental the inspectors found
problems that required the planes to be taken out of service
briefly, although in some of the cases problems were corrected
quick enough so that flights were not delayed.
   ``These are not unusual percentages,'' said McArtor, adding that
they likely would be ``what we would find ... at other airlines''
undergoing a similarly intense series of examinations. In some
cases, he said, Continental corrected problems before they came to
the attention of FAA inspectors, McArtor said.
   ``So far, we have not found anything we would consider to be
grossly unsafe on any aircraft,'' McArtor said. But he added that
while the problems that were found ``appear to be minor'' they may
be cause an erosion of the margin of safety if not corrected.
   ``We're dealing with the margin of safety'' that the FAA expects
the airlines to maintain, McArtor said.
   No details were available on the kinds of problems that FAA
inspectors have found. McArtor mentioned in general that they
included such items as dents or small tears in aircraft skin or
``minor leaks'' in equipment.
   Burnley and McArtor ordered the special review of Eastern
aircraft on April 13 after the FAA became concerned about
continuing safety violations at the Miami-based airline. At the
time, Eastern also was hit with a proposed $823,000 fine because of
earlier violations.
   Four days later Burnley ordered the inspections expanded to
include Continental as well. He said a search of FAA records showed
that the agency had assembled a series of enforcement actions
against Continental that could lead to total fines of more than $1
million.

<HEAD>Consumer Advocates Call For Warning Labels On Toys With Small
Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocates are joining a congressman's
call for mandatory warning labels on toys that contain parts small
enough for toddlers to choke on.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said Thursday that labels stating
``Ages 3 and up'' seem to many parents simply like recommendations
for ability levels and not a safety warning.
   ``Too often the proud parent thinks `my Susie and my Sammy are
so smart they certainly have the ability to play with this toy',''
said Ann Brown, chairwoman of the consumer affairs committee of
Americans for Democratic Action.
   ``Little does the unsuspecting parent realize that this is not
an ability label, but is a danger label and should be followed
absolutely,'' she said.
   Gejdenson has drafted legislation to require all toys with small
parts to include a label with the word ``WARNING'' in capital
letters and a statement that children under 3 can choke on the
parts.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission prohibits toy
manufacturers from marketing products with small parts to children
under 3, but the agency has no labeling requirements. Most U.S.
manufacturers print age recommendations on the toy packages, but
many of those do not outline the potential health hazard.
   Chris Nelson, a compliance officer at the commission, said the
agency has asked certain companies to print small-parts warnings on
their labels.
   But she said the commission has not made it mandatory because it
would be difficult to prove a direct link between the lack of
labeling and choking deaths and injuries. She said such proof would
be necessary for the commission to issue a regulation.

   A Baptist minister who gathers his flock
with automatic, pre-recorded phone messages says the best thing
about his new telecomputer is that it always turns the other cheek.
   ``It takes no breaks for lunch or a drink of water. If somebody
hangs up, it doesn't get mad,'' said the Rev. Charles West. ``One
person can't make the calls this machine does in the same time
frame.''
   The telecomputer is programmed to dial phone numbers and deliver
West's message of the day to his congregation at the First Baptist
Church in Bethalto.
   If a dialed number isn't answered, his machine will redial every
30 minutes for three hours. If it gets a busy signal, it will
redial every five minutes for 30 minutes.
   The message is changed every Saturday.
   West concedes that a taped message sounds impersonal, but said
it's a good way to keep in touch with his growing congregation of
525 members.
   ``People are actively involved in their own lives,'' he said.
``The church used to be the center of community life, but not any
more.''
   On the day before Easter _ when daylight savings time began _
the church members got this call:
   ``Hello, this is Pastor West calling. I trust you're ready for
Easter. Don't forget to turn your clocks up.''
   The call also offered information about church services, and had
room for parishioners to leave a message.
   West hopes to reach non-parishioners and invite them to attend
First Baptist with the telecomputer, which can be programmed to
call every phone number in Bethalto and the surrounding area.
   The pastor believes he could get two new members out of every 20
calls.

   Are you an easy mark for door to door
salesmen? Do you lose receipts for cash down payments? Do you buy
wrinkle cream from mail order companies?
   These are the types of questions players face in a new board
game called ``Market Place,'' produced by the Delaware Division of
Consumer Affairs.
   ``We use nuts and bolts as the game pieces because the game
deals with the nuts and bolts of consumer affairs,'' said Nancy
Hebner, division spokeswoman.
   The game was developed as ``a good way for people to increase
their knowledge about the pitfalls of being a consumer,'' Mrs.
Hebner said.
   The object of the game is to be the first to reach the money
tree in the middle of the game board. Players advance around a
winding track on the board by drawing a card and following its
directions.
   Cards that can make players move back one space say things like
``You spent $40 for miracle weight loss pills that `melt away fat
while you sleep.''' Or how about ``You didn't read the fine print
of the record club or book club offer.''
   Cards that can help a player advance one or two spaces include
``You always get three written estimates before hiring a roofing
contractor,'' ``You send all formal complaint letters by certified
mail,'' and ``You never give out your credit card number to sales
people who call you on the telephone.''
   The directions on the cards are based on calls the division
receives daily from consumers, Mrs. Hebner said.
   ``It's a simple game, but if people follow instructions and
think about what they're doing, it will probably save them a lot of
money and a lot of grief in the years ahead,'' Mrs. Hebner said.

<HEAD>Chicago Man To Be Oldest To Be Ordained as Catholic Priest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After waiting a lifetime, a 79-year-old
father of six will become in June the oldest man ever to be
ordained a Roman Catholic priest in the United States.
   ``I'm here for one purpose only. I'm expecting to graduate and
become a priest and from then on live the life of priest with
whatever the duties are given me. That's it. I'm not trying to be a
celebrity,'' William R. Schumacher said Thursday.
   ``In a way, it's been working on me ... I don't want it to
interfere with my vocation,'' said Schumacher, who is completing
his final exams at Holy Apostles College and Seminary in this
Hartford suburb in central Connecticut.
   A widower and the grandfather of 13, Schumacher will finish his
exams next week as a B-plus student and graduate May 8 to complete
his three years as a seminarian.
   He will formally enter the priesthood at St. Tarcissus Roman
Catholic Church in his native Chicago and will be assigned to the
Dallas diocese, where he hopes to work with the sick and aged.
   A heavy man, with a full face, wire-rim glasses, a neatly
trimmed mustache and thick white hair, Schumacher hopes there is a
lesson in his case that will help others his age who are uncertain
about whether to commit to the church.
   He sums up that message as: ``Go for it. ... There is an
opportunity. There is a place to be.''
   Schumacher wanted to enroll in a seminary at age 18 after
completing his schooling at DePaul Academy. But he was dissuaded by
a priest who reminded him that there was no one to provide for his
recently widowed mother.
   Instead, he went to work and took courses at DePaul and Loyola
universities. He married in September 1931 while enrolled in law
school.
   He quit the next year without a degree as the Depression dragged
on and ``encumberances were getting heavier and heavier.``
   He became an insurance broker, and for the next 40 years pursued
various other careers as a credit manager and adviser to a variety
of company presidents. In 1962, he took a position as jobs
counselor with the Illinois Department of Labor, a position he held
until retiring in 1975.
   During this period, he was active in the Boy Scouts and the
church. He became a grand knight in the Knights of Columbus.
   After his wife died of a stroke in 1984, Schumacher decided it
was time to enter the priesthood. ``At that time, it was when I
said, `Lord, now I'm ready. There's nothing to hold me back,'''
Schumacher recalled.
   After deciding to become a priest, Schumacher then had to fight
the skeptics and system that thought him too old. Only four
seminaries in the country accept students of advanced age, and Holy
Apostles agreed to accept him if he found a bishop to sponsor him.
After 50 bishops rejected him, a Dallas bishop finally agreed to
sponsor him.
   Four leading American seminaries, the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops and a leading Catholic scholar all have confirmed
that Schumacher is the oldest to face ordination, according to a
Chicago public relations firm handling publicity for Schumacher.
   ``We've overcome the obstacles that have been in the way, and
there were a lot of them. And now we're on to ... the beginning,``
Schumacher said.

   The blast that ripped a huge hole in an Aloha
Airlines jetliner over the Pacific Ocean appears to be unlike any
previous accident involving Boeing planes, say officials of the
aircraft company.
   Tom Cole and David Jimenez of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the
main Boeing Co. subsidiary, said Thursday night they had received
only sketchy reports of the explosion, which ripped off the top of
the fuselage just behind the cockpit to about the wing, injuring 60
people and leaving one person missing.
   Both executives said there were no fuel lines or other potential
sources for an explosion in the first-class cabin, just behind the
cockpit, where passengers on the Boeing 737-200 reported that the
blast occurred.
   ``The fuel is in the wing, the engines are in the wing and the
fuel lines are all right there,'' Cole said in a telephone
interview from his home.
   Even in the extremely unlikely event that a turbine blade tore
loose from one of the two engines and ripped into the fuselage in
mid-flight, it could not hit forward from the wing and the effect
would be nothing like what happened to the Aloha plane, he said.
   ``To have it just explode in the air is just unheard of,'' Cole
said. ``I think this is a very unusual circumstance that is not
related to any other accidents we have had.''
   FBI agents were sent from Honolulu to check the possibility that
a bomb might have been put on the plane, said FBI spokesman Robert
Heafner.
   Jimenez, also interviewed from his home, said the plane was one
of nine 737-200s delivered to Aloha in the late 1970s.
   The 737 series is Boeing's smallest jetliner and the company's
all-time best seller, with total orders for 2,031 planes as of
Thursday. Cole said 35 to 37 737s have either crashed or been
disabled by terrorists, lightning or other means.
   The first 737-200 was put into service in April 1968, and nearly
1,100 remain in use today, Cole said. It can carry as many as 120
passengers, depending on the seating configuration, and has a range
of 2,600 miles.
   The 200 was the second version of the 737s and costs $17 million
to $22 million each. Production of the model has ceased, with the
last 737-200 to be delivered later this year, Jimenez said.

   A mild earthquake rattled this
desert community but there were no reports of damage or injuries,
authorities said.
   Police clerk Pam Sims said the quake shook things up for several
seconds, prompting 20 or 30 calls in the first 10 minutes after it
struck Thursday night. ``I was deciding whether to go under my desk
or not,'' she said.
   The 10:30 p.m. earthquake measured 3.7 on the Richter scale and
was centered about 19 miles northwest of the city, said Robert Finn
of the Seismology Lab for the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake,
capable of widespread heavy damage.

   Burt Reynolds built a white wedding chapel
on his horse ranch to exchange marriage vows with Loni Anderson in
a closely guarded ceremony before 20 guests today.
   ``They're getting married _ they're definitely getting
married,'' Bob Davidoff, a Palm Beach photographer who took the
official pictures of Reynolds' marriage to actress Judy Carne 25
years ago, told The Palm Beach Post Thursday.
   Reynolds, 52, mentioned his intentions two months ago in a
magazine article that quoted him as saying he expected to be
married within a year.
   Several people told the newspaper the marriage ceremony was
scheduled for 1 p.m. in the chapel, but David Gershenson, Reynolds'
personal manager, refused to confirm or deny the rumors.
   ``It's Burt's personal life,'' he said by phone from Hollywood,
Calif. ``Over the last six years there have been rumors that they
were getting married, that they had broken up. One of these days
it's going to be true.''
   Miss Anderson, 42, best known for her role as a secretary in the
TV series ``WKRP in Cincinnati,'' reportedly was staying with
Reynolds' sister, Nancy Brown, in Jupiter and her relatives were
nearby in the Hilton of Jupiter Beach.
   The couple planned to leave by helicopter after the ceremony for
a honeymoon in the Bahamas, said a source close to Reynolds' pilot,
Logan Fleming.

   Hewlett-Packard founder David Packard plans
to bequeath his $2 billion fortune to the foundation created by him
and his late wife, making the charity one of the nation's 10
wealthiest, its director said.
   The Los Altos-based David and Lucile Packard foundation, valued
at $145 million, would rank with others such as the Ford
Foundation, valued at $4.7 billion, executive director Cole Wilbur
said Thursday.
   The bulk of the donation will consist of stock contributed to
the foundation, a charitable organization created by the Packards
in 1964 to finance education and health projects throughout the
world, Wilbur said.
   Packard, 75, told Wilbur last week of his intention to leave the
money to the foundation when he dies, the director said.
   ``His feeling is that there is a lot of important concerns in
research and education, and he'd like to help develop them and to
help really make a difference in this community and the world,''
said Wilbur.
   Packard was away from his office and unavailable for comment,
the company said.
   Packard's wife died in May 1987, and the couple's four children
are closely involved in planning the donation, Wilbur said.
   Packard is chairman of the Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard
Corp., located in Silicon Valley about 25 miles south of San
Francisco. The company is a scientific instrument and computer
research and development concern founded in 1939 by Packard and
William Hewlett.

   Judge Gerhard A. Gesell's angry charge that
the Reagan administration was impeding the trial of Oliver North
and three Iran-Contra co-defendants was a performance familar to
lawyers who frequent his courtroom.
   A day after Gesell accused the administration of intentionally
withholding classified documents that he says the defendants were
entitled to see, the veteran federal judge calmly acknowledged the
government's fears about disclosing some of its most sensitive
secrets.
   Having angrily said Wednesday that ``a stone wall is being built
up between this court and the trial,'' Gesell took the bench in
U.S. District Court on Thursday and discussed the problem in milder
tones.
   He blandly described it as an ``obstacle caused by concerns in
the government generally concerning the confidentiality of
documents'' and offered ``to see if I can be of any help to this
situation.''
   The switch in the judge's courtroom demeanor was described by
one lawyer as ``typical Gesell _ bark, bark bark, meow, meow,
meow.''
   Another lawyer, who also did not want to be personally
associated with a comment about a sitting judge, said Gesell
``blows hot and cold.''
   Despite his changed demeanor, Gesell did not retreat Thursday
from his earlier threat to dismiss the case unless the relevant
classified documents are shown to the defense and made available
for use at trial as evidence.
   That possibility is a very real one, particularly if independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is unable to persuade the CIA, the State
Department or other national security agencies to declassify
sensitive documents Gesell decides are needed as evidence for the
defense.
   ``The government is obliged to make all relevant information
available in some reasonable way to the defense and using the
monolithic term `government' might not be appropriate where the
independent counsel really does not call the shots,'' said Richard
Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor.
   Lawyers for North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and businessmen Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord, will be looking closely for material they
can predict won't be declassified.
   As former guardians of some of the nation's most sensitive
secrets, North and Poindexter are in a unique position to help
their lawyers find evidence that is beyond the court's reach.
   A successful search of the 300,000 pages of sensitive material
collected by Walsh could lead to dismissal of charges they
conspired to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales
to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   At an earlier hearing, Gesell referred to the complicated
procedures for handling sensitive documents and remarked that North
``knows more about the methods than those in the classification
system.''
   With secret documents deemed relevant and admissable as evidence
``you end up with the double D's: declassify or dismiss,'' said
defense lawyer E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., who once prosecuted
anti-terrorism cases for the Justice Department.
   ``I don't know of any case since the Classified Information
Procedures Act was passed not quite 10 years ago that has ever had
the volume of relevant classified material that this one does,'' he
said.
   The law contains elaborate procedures for determining whether
classified material is relevant evidence for the prosecution and
the defense. If the government won't declassify a document, it
allows for deletions of secret material of substitution of
summaries to enable the introduction of relevant evidence.
   But not all documents can be easily altered or summarized and
Gesell said he won't spend much time on that process, particularly
since Walsh says 50,000 pages are relevant to the case.
   ``What is the government going to do, or the judge going to do
if the government says `we can't declassify this, It is just too
sensitive'?'' Barcella said.
   The problem is particularly acute in the Iran-Contra case
because ``the essence of some of the crimes that are charged is
classified activity,'' he said.
   Joseph diGenova, who recently resigned as U.S. attorney here,
noted that ``it may very well be that some of that stuff is so
sensitive under no circumstances should it be released.''
   And if Gesell is forced to dismiss the charges because there is
too much classified evidence, ``so be it,'' diGenova said. ``That
was how the statute was designed. That is the way it is supposed to
work.''

   Here are some comments from the presidential
campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, saying he will make make the trade bill an
issue in his campaign against George Bush: ``I think the issues of
workers being laid off, what is happening to the industrial base of
this country, and the failure of this administration to do much to
deal with that ... will be very much one of the major issues.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, contradicting statements by his campaign manager
that he is no longer seeking to win the Democratic nomination after
a series of losses to Dukakis: ``We're winning every day on this
long and tortuous journey to the White House. ... Nothing and
nobody is going to turn us around.''
   
   ANDREW YOUNG, mayor of Atlanta, on Jackson's candidacy: ``It
really doesn't help at all if he's not elected president. It's not
just a matter of feeling good. Jesse ran to see some good done for
poor people and black people.''
   
   JOHN SASSO, Dukakis' former campaign manager who left his job
after embarrassing the candidate last year, on his current
relationship with Dukakis: ``Mike and I are good friends, and, as
he has said, we still talk from time to time, discuss things. But I
have no active role with the campaign.''

<HEAD>Lord Brockway, Veteran Socialist, Pacifist, Prison Inmate Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Brockway, the veteran socialist, pacifist,
political writer and prison inmate who campaigned for India's
independence from Britain and championed African nationalism, has
died, his family reported.
   He was 99.
   Brockway died Thursday night at Watford General Hospital in
Hertfordshire outside London. He had been in the hospital since
April 19. His family said he had been in bad health for some time
but no specific cause of death was given.
   Paying tribute to him Thursday night, Neil Kinnock, leader of
the socialist opposition Labor Party, said: ``Throughout the whole
of this century, in Britain and in so many other countries, he was
an inspiration to all who love liberty and work for socialism.''
   Archibald Fenner Brockway was born in Calcutta, India, the son
of a clergyman, and was educated in Britain at the School for the
Sons of Missionaries.
   During World War I, Brockway became secretary of the No
Conscription Fellowship. He was later joint secretary of the
British Committee of the Indian National Congress, editor of the
publication India, joint secretary of the Prison System Inquiry
Committee, and chairman of the No More War Movement and War
Resister's International.
   In 1927, he was a fraternal delegate to the Indian Trade Union
Congress and Indian National Congress and in 1929, he was elected
to the British House of Commons as a Labor Party legislator.
   In the early 1930s, he transferred his allegiance to the
Independent Labor Party, becoming its chairman in 1931. But he
rejoined the main Labor Party in 1946.
   Throughout his Commons career Brockway campaigned for abolition
of the House of Lords, the unelected upper house of the British
Parliament, on grounds it was a bastion of privilege.
   But in 1964 he accepted a life peerage from Queen Elizabeth II,
which automatically gave him a seat in the Lords. He said at the
time that he accepted the peerage reluctantly, but he attended
debates in the Lords regularly.
   Brockway wrote about 30 books, mostly on politics and social
issues.
   In his autobiography, he recalled encounters with his close
friend the Irish-born playwright and socialist George Bernard Shaw,
with George Orwell, the left-wing British author of ``1984,''
``Animal Farm'' and other books, and with Mahatma Gandhi, whose
campaign for Indian freedom from British rule culminated in
independence in 1947.
   Brockway served five prison terms during his turbulent life.
   Two prison terms, one with hard labor, resulted from his
militant pacifism during World War I. The other three stemmed from
demonstrations against the hydrogen bomb, capitalism and racialism.
   He was a champion of African nationalism and during his years in
the Commons was sometimes referred to by parliamentary colleagues
as ``The Honorable Member for Africa.''
   Describing himself as a humanist but not an atheist, Brockway
once declared: ``I don't know if there is a God or an afterlife and
I don't particularly worry about it. But if there is, the best way
to prepare is to work for justice here now.''
   Former Labor Party leader Michael Foot said: ``He was one of the
very greatest libertarian socialists of this century and all
democratic socialists all over the world honor him.''
   Brockway is survived by his second wife, Edith King, their son,
and four daughters from his first marriage to Lilla Harvey-Smith.

   A woman whose car plowed into an after-school
crowd at an elementary school, killing a 4-year-old girl and a
woman and injuring eight others, has been charged with negligent
driving, police say.
   Witnesses said the two-door sedan crashed through a chain-link
fence and careened across an asphalt playground before running up a
short flight of stairs to where the crowd was gathered Thursday
afternoon in an entryway of Cyrus H. McCormick Elementary School.
   ``There were mothers screaming, looking for their children,''
said Araceli Hernandez, whose niece lives with her and attends the
school. ``Almost every child that was on the floor had their mother
next to them.''
   Principal Jim Crowe and teachers helped lift the car, which was
lodged in the two-story building, to free some victims trapped
beneath the wheels.
   ``I called for 10 ambulances,'' Crowe said. ``I told them there
were bodies all over the playground.''
   Two of the injured youngsters remained in critical condition
today.
   Marcella Diaz, 30, was waiting for her 5-year-old son, Roger,
and her 12-year-old daughter, Lynne, when the accident happened.
   ``I was picking up my son when I turned my head and saw the car
coming,'' she says. ``I just screamed and picked up my son with my
hands and ran away. The car missed us by a yard and a half.''
   Isabel Fuentes, 37, was charged with leaving the scene of an
accident and negligent driving, Officer Terry Pickens said. She was
arrested near the school and freed after posting $100 cash bond and
her driver's license.
   Reuben Fuentes, a pupil at the school, said his mother
apparently had come to the school to pick him up.
   ``Our opinion is that she was driving too fast for conditions,''
said Sgt. Thomas Reynolds of the police department's major
accidents unit. He didn't know exactly how fast she was traveling
but said Mrs. Fuentes, who suffered a bloody nose in the accident,
was ``going over the 20 mph speed limit.''
   There was no evidence of intoxication or use of drugs, Reynolds
said, adding that authorities were investigating the possibility
that the car's brakes failed or the accelerator malfunctioned.
   A police spokeswoman who declined to give her name said today
she was unsure whether Mrs. Fuentes honked her horn or tried to
warn those in her car's path.
   Alma Cordero, Mrs. Fuentes' niece, said she had been told the
car needed repairs. ``She is a real good driver,'' said Ms.
Cordero, 28. ``She never got into an accident.''
   The schoolground was left littered with shattered glass, bodies
and blood. ``Everyone was screaming and running around,'' Liz
Escarzaga, 18, said of what happened. ``Some ladies started
praying.''
   ``I was helping one mother because she kept screaming for
help,'' Miss Escarzaga said. ``In school, they say when someone's
injured don't move him because they get can get worse.
   ``I took off my jacket,'' she said. ``I took off my sweater and
then put them both under a boy's head. He passed out.''
   Authorities identified the dead as Veronica Marquez, 4, who
suffered head and abdominal injuries, and Dolores Torres, between
60 and 65.
   ``She waits there every day faithfully to make sure her kids get
home safely,'' Crowe said of Mrs. Torres, whose grandchildren
attend the school.
   The school system will try to arrange a special memorial, said
Manford Byrd, superintendent of the Chicago Public Schools.
   ``We want to help those students overcome their grief,'' he
said. ``If we have to do counseling, we'll do that.''
   Authorities decided to open the school today because ``I think
the teachers can help the children overcome this tragedy.''

<HEAD>`Chess,' A New Musical By Tim Rice and ABBA, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs with other reviews; no PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Life is just a game played out on a big
checkered board, or so they seem to be saying in ``Chess,'' the
heavy-handed British musical hit that lumbered into Broadway's
Imperial Theater on Thursday night.
   In this case, it's the theatergoers who are checkmated, trapped
for more than three hours in a cold and unappealing musical that
ranks as one of the season's biggest disappointments.
   That's surprising considering the show boasts a provocative,
tuneful score with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Benny Andersson
and Bjorn Ulvaeus, two members of the pop group ABBA. But the
songwriters are shortchanged by director Trevor Nunn and playwright
Richard Nelson who have fashioned a musical that is big on metaphor
and short on credibility, not to mention entertainment.
   The plot, apparently reworked a bit from the London production,
is a romantic triangle involving a volatile and vulgar American
chess champion (Philip Casnoff), his Soviet opponent (David
Carroll) and the American's second (Judy Kuhn), a Hungarian refugee
who falls for the Russian at the drop of a rook.
   The American is sort of the John McEnroe of chess. The
champion's manners _ and politics _ are somewhere to the right of
Genghis Khan. His distastefulness dulls one point of this love
triangle, making it hard for the audience to wonder who will end up
with whom, let alone who will win the big match.
   The triangle eventually becomes a quartet when it is revealed
that the Russian has a wife (Marcia Mitzman) back in Moscow. She
doesn't show up until the second act, and by then the story has
bogged down completely.
   The three chess players are manipulated by an assortment of CIA
and KGB agents as well as public relations types who sing and dance
their way through the show. Everyone is the pawn of someone else, a
soap opera message Nelson reiterates with numbing frequency.
   Nunn, who previously worked wonders on ``Cats,'' ``Les
Miserables'' and ``The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby,''
falters with this show. Like ``Les Miserables,'' ``Chess'' relies
on a turntable to make the musical move. But it doesn't work as
well.
   Set designer Robin Wagner provides a series of gray,
concrete-like columns that glide, swivel and turn around the stage.
Their perpetual motion eventually becomes monotonous and even
irritating.
   Much of the time, the characters just stand on stage and shout _
at each other or toward the audience. There's not much Nunn can do
with these argumentative moments, but when a number cries out for
some musical movement, it doesn't get any help.
   Consider the exotic song ``One Night in Bangkok,'' a sizable pop
success several years ago, and virtually thrown away here in an
embarrassing flesh-peddling scene that looks like it was borrowed
from a summer stock revival of ``The World of Suzie Wong.''
   The show has been cast with strong voices, even down to the
smallest roles. At a result, many of the songs soar in spite of the
story. Miss Kuhn has a radiant voice, and when she doesn't push it,
the sound embraces the theater. Her quiet moments are the best,
particularly ``Heaven Help My Heart,'' a delicate solo, and ``I
Know Him So Well,'' a duet of commiseration that Miss Kuhn sings
with the Russian's neglected wife.
   The songwriters also have provided some memorable music for the
men, particularly the bitter ``Pity the Child,'' which contains
Rice's finest lyrics. It's an explanation by the American grand
master as to why he turned out to be such a rotter. Casnoff
succeeds too well in conveying the character's miserable
personality.
   Carroll, who possesses an even better voice, manages to make the
Russian more than a milquetoast, not an inconsiderable achievement,
considering Nelson's laborious plot. The performer brings the
overlong first act to a thrilling conclusion with a ringing anthem
to his homeland.
   As good as the score is, there is too much of it. The
songwriters added several songs for the American production,
including ``Someone Else's Story,'' one number that has likely pop
potential. But less would have been more.
   The costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge are undistinguished,
all-purpose modern clothes that are remarkably ordinary and, in the
case of Miss Kuhn, unflattering. David Hersey's lighting at least
tries to bathe Wagner's dozen or so behemoth columns in a soft,
humanizing glow.
   It's that humane, personal quality which is missing from the
rest of the production. The musical revels in its political message
and its conceit of a chess game as a microcosm of real life. Not
even the fine handiwork of its three gifted songwriters can make
the sledgehammer symbolism of ``Chess'' palatable.
   In other reviews:
   Howard Kissel writes in the Daily News that Chess is ``a show
without a game plan. ...
   ``The characters are cliches, and not even appropriate ones. ...
Neither of the love stories is emotionally involving. ... Visually
`Chess' is drab. ... The show is shrilly overamplified. ...
   ``The lingering question ... is why anyone imagined
international politics was something to sing about.''
   In The New York Times, Frank Rich writes: ``Rather than
condescend to throwing the audience a bone of genuinely romantic or
melodramatic entertainment _ or even providing a tense chess game _
the authors pass the time pontificating about politics in sweeping
generalities reminiscent of Mr. Rice's `Evita.' ''
   Referring to ``the musical's metaphorical equation of chess and
war,'' Rich says: ``War is hell, and ... `Chess' sometimes comes
remarkably close.''

   The Food and Drug Administration says the
importer of e Castello Danish Blue Cheese has been recalled its
product because some samples showed a bacterium that can cause
flu-like symptoms.
   The agency said Thursday more than 2,000, 35-ounce pieces of the
cheese sent to distributors in New York, New Jersey, California,
Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, Mississippi, Texas, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oregon are being recalled.
   They recalled cheeses were in cartons coded TCU213 and the
individual pieces have the lot number 02X on their wrappers.
   The cheese was made by Tholstrup Cheese in Copenhagen, Denmark,
and imported by Tholstrup Cheese USA of Warren, N.J.
   The FDA said the bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, occasionally
can be life-threatening to pregnant women and their fetuses, frail

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed a
multibillion-dollar education measure expanding services to
students.
   In a signing ceremony on Thursday, Reagan said the measure
``reauthorizes and improves a wide variety of federal programs at
the elementary and secondary school level.''
   More than half of the $8.3 billion authorized in the bill will
go to disadvantaged children at risk of failing.
   It contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help high
school students with weak skills, and greatly expands drug abuse
education and magnet schools. New money also was earmarked for
math, science and foreign-language programs.
   The largest single program in the measure will pay for tutoring
and other services to disadvantaged children who are in danger of
failing academically.
   Other initiatives in the bill include $50 million for ``Even
Start,'' to jointly educate poor preschool children and their
illiterate parents; $50 million for dropout prevention
demonstration projects; and $200 million to improve basic skills of
high school students.

<HEAD>Congressman Says HUD Sees Defeat in Effort To Cut Aid to Cities</HEAD>

   With Rent Control
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York congressman says an attempt by the
Reagan administration to cut off millions of dollars in federal aid
to cities with rent control has virtually been defeated.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., on Thursday revealed what he said
amounted to an admission of defeat in a letter from Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.. The letter said
the administration would propose legislation for fiscal 1989 to
restrict rental rehabilitation grants to areas without rent control
laws.
   ``The restriction cannot go into effect until legislation has
been adopted by Congress and signed by the president,'' Pierce
wrote.
   In January, the Office of Management and Budget had suggested
making the change through federal regulation. But HUD spokesman
Jack Flynn said his department ``has always maintained that it
would require legislation'' to change the grant program.
   ``The letter is a carefully worded admission of defeat,''
Schumer said of Pierce's comments. ``Administration officials first
tried to impose their callous plan through regulation because they
knew legislation to interfere with local housing laws would stand
no chance in Congress. Once they saw that Congress would not let
their regulation go into effect, they backed off.''

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Lendl Olympic Bill, But There May Be No Room On
Team</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to make tennis star Ivan Lendl an
American citizen in time to play for the U.S. Olympic team in Seoul
this summer is moving swiftly through Congress, but the team may
have no room for the world's No. 1 player.
   The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved the special
immigration bill for Lendl, which would waive the five-year period
permanent residents are required to wait before receiving
citizenship.
   But the chief spokesman for the U.S. Tennis Association said the
team has already been selected and that it is highly unlikely a
player would be bumped to make room for Lendl even if the Czech
native receives U.S. citizenship and clears another series of
procedural hurdles to become eligible.
   ``This would put us in a very difficult situation,'' said Ed
Fabricius, director of communications for the association. ``I
don't see it happening. We've already selected the team.''
   Lendl, 28, the world's No. 1 ranked tennis player, is a native
of Czechoslovakia, but has lived in Greenwich, Conn., since 1981
and has adopted the United States as his home. Lendl won his
permanent resident status last year and has personally lobbied
lawmakers.

<HEAD>Althea Gibson Donates Wimbledon Trophies to Smithsonian</HEAD>

   The five Wimbledon trophies won by Althea
Gibson, the first black American tennis champion, will be housed at
the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.
   ``Who could have imagined? Who could have thought?'' the
60-year-old Gibson said at the Smithsonian ceremony where she
presented the trophies Thursday. ``Here stands before you a Negro
woman, raised in Harlem, who went on to become a tennis player ...
and finally wind up being a world champion, in fact, the first
black woman champion of this world.''
   Gibson described herself as ``a born athlete,'' noting her 200
bowling average and membership in the Mysterious Five girls'
basketball team before she met Fred Johnson, the one-armed tennis
coach who taught her to play.
   Gibson began competing in the U.S. championships at Forest
Hills, N.Y., in 1950 and at Wimbledon in 1951, but it was not until
1956 that she began to win major tennis tournaments throughout
Europe, including the women's doubles championship at Wimbledon.
   For the next two years Gibson captured both the singles and
doubles championships at Wimbledon and was voted the Woman Athlete
of the Year for 1957 by The Associated Press.
   Although the trophies will be held in storage, a Harry C. Lee
tennis racket and a tennis dress she used in one of her
championship matches were placed on public view immediately.

<HEAD>Yugoslavian Painter Returns To Chicago Looking For Portrait Of
Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An artist whose portraits over the decades have
included Herbert Hoover and Conrad Hilton says he hasn't seen his
most treasured work in 26 years: a painting of his wife.
   Gustav Likan, 77, has returned to Chicago from his home in
Austin, Texas, to try to find the 30-inch-by-40-inch painting of
his wife in a violet dress with a cat on her lap. She died last
year.
   ``My wife was so beautiful. The picture really had a lot of
charm,'' said Likan, who wants to acquire the picture from its
current owner _ whoever and wherever that may be.
   The story told in Thursday's Chicago Tribune, began in 1962 when
the struggling Yugoslavian immigrant couldn't afford to repay
$2,000 he borrowed from his brother-in-law to get his family to the
United States.
   Likan had made a name for himself decades earlier by painting
portraits of Yugoslavia's young King Peter and murals for Argentine
first lady Eva Peron's schools.
   His brother-in-law filed a lawsuit to recover the money, and
some of Likan's paintings were auctioned by the Cook County
sheriff. The brother-in-law bought the painting of Mrs. Likan for
$355, but Likan believes it was then immediately sold.
   The brother-in-law and his wife died without children in the
mid-1960s, and the two families parted ways after the disagreement,
so Likan doesn't know where the painting might be.
   ``It's a dream to have this picture,'' Likan said. ``Maybe the
owner is rich. He doesn't need the painting. It's worth a lot more
to me, from an artistic standpoint and for my family.''
   The painting was valued at $2,000 when it was auctioned, Likan
said, adding that he believes it would be worth $8,000 today.
   ``It could be anyplace,'' said Capt. James Zurawski of the
police department's financial investigation unit. ``It's like
looking for a needle in a haystack.
   ``I used to work at the galleries,'' Zurawski said. ``Paintings
go for cash usually, and the buyer is usually just an initial.''

<HEAD>Dark Suntanning Losing Favor Among Fashion Leaders, Dermatologists
Say</HEAD>

   Deep, dark suntans are fading from fashionability
because of cancer and wrinkle fears, according to a survey
sponsored by a dermatologists' group. But tanning-industry
officials say the bronze look is alive and well.
   Fifty fashion leaders surveyed by the American Academy of
Dermatology and the Avon Foundation were ``virtually unanimous'' in
their opinion that the dark tan once fashionable is no longer in
vogue, the academy said.
   ``The main reasons for caution under the sun are fear of
premature aging and knowledge about skin cancer,'' the doctors'
group said.
   Those polled ranged from Cosmopolitan magazine editor Helen
Gurley Brown to New York model-agency head Eileen Ford, the academy
said in a statement promoting May as ``Melanoma-Skin Cancer
Detection and Prevention Month.''
   Doctors say the popularity of suntanning is partly to blame for
the soaring U.S. rates of melanoma, a skin cancer that killed an
estimated 5,800 Americans last year.
   ``There are still addicted-to-tan people who will never conquer
the addiction,'' Ms. Brown told the survey. ``The reason the rest
of us are more careful is because of all the information being
disseminated. You just could not avoid knowing, at this point, if
you can read, that heavy suntanning does cause skin cancer.''
   Ms. Ford told the survey, ``Today's style is a healthy glow, not
sun-baked skin.''
   But those in the tanning trade point to booming business at
tanning parlors, an increasing number of tourists at sun resorts
and millions of dollars being spent on tanning aids.
   There are more than 275,000 commercial tanning beds in the
United States, said Bo Wunsch, a spokesman for Silver Solarium
Inc., a tanning equipment importer in San Francisco.
   ``It is not only the fashion in this country. It is the fashion
throughout Western Europe,'' he said in a telephone interview
Thursday.
   Vacations to sun resorts have not fallen off, either, according
to figures from Club Med Sales Inc. in New York, which sold 350,400
trips to its 109 sun resorts last year, said spokeswoman Edwina
Arnold. That was almost a 16 percent rise from the 302,100 trips in
1985, she said.
   In the $450 million suntan-lotion market, products that promote
tanning more than block it gained a slight market share from 1986
to 1987, from 46 percent to 52 percent, said Debra Bennetts, a
spokeswoman for makers of Bain de Soleil.
   She shared the view that lighter tanning is the trend and said
her company, Richardson-Vicks in Wilton, Conn., for the first time
is adding a new product this season with the highest possible sun
protection factor, or SPF, rating _ 30.
   ``And in our advertising for this current season, our model's
tan is much lighter than in past years,'' she said in a telephone
interview Thursday. ``We like to think we're going to set what
becomes fashionable.''
   But David Rollins, U.S. distributor of Eurotan Professional Tan
Accelerator, said people are buying his product faster than ever,
and his company in Harrisburg, Ill., has sold 500,000 bottles since
February.
   Managers of two Chicago tanning parlors randomly selected said
they are having their best year ever.
   ``I really don't see tanning ever going out of style, to be
honest with you,'' said Tom Neighbors, manager of Eurotan Halsted,
which serves about 100 customers a day. ``It's been around
forever.''

<HEAD>Fewer Than One In 10 Americans Knows Cholesterol Level, Study

<TEXT>
   If you know your cholesterol level,
congratulations. Most Americans don't.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
only 6 percent of the adults surveyed in 32 states last year could
recall what their cholesterol levels were.
   ``People don't know their numbers,'' said Dr. Patrick L.
Remington, a CDC cholesterol specialist. ``We've got a long way to
go to get people to know their numbers.''
   The federal government's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System regularly asks people about their health and behavior. Last
year, for the first time, interviewers asked randomly selected
adults in 32 states and the District of Columbia about their
cholesterol.
   Less than half the respondents, 47 percent, had ever had a
cholesterol check at all. Less than half of those people, or just
19 percent overall, said they had been told what their cholesterol
level was. And of those people, fewer than one-third, or only 6
percent overall, remembered what the level was.
   ``In the past, a doctor might do a cholesterol check during a
checkup, look at the reading, and tell the patient, `You're
fine,''' Remington said. ``What we're encouraging is for patients
to say, `I'd like to know what my number is.'
   ``And not only should you know your number, but you should know
what it means.''
   A cholesterol level of below 200 _ measured in milligrams per
deciliter of blood _ is considered ``desirable,'' according to the
CDC. More than 200 is considered ``borderline high,'' and over 240
is ``high.''
   Although the survey respondents' cholesterol could not be
independently checked, most people who claim to know their
cholesterol ``do a very good job,'' Remington said. ``And if they
don't know the exact number, they may be able to classify
themselves'' as high or desirable, he added.
   Evidence about the links between cholesterol and heart disease
has grown in the past decade, the CDC noted in its weekly report.
Government researchers believe a 25 percent reduction in
cholesterol can cut a person's risk of heart disease in half.
   Remington said cholesterol specialists want people to know their
exact numbers to avoid misconceptions. An old rule of thumb said
that anything under a figure of 200-plus-patient-age was OK, but
``that's obviously passe,'' he said, citing the current standards.
   In the 32 states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of
people knowing their cholesterol ranged from 1 percent in New
Mexico to a high of 9 percent in Maine, Maryland and Washington
state.
   The percentage of respondents who had ever had a cholesterol
check at all ranged from 29 percent in New Mexico to 57 percent in
Maryland.
   The margin of polling error for the surveys differed from state
to state and question to question, but ranged from 1 percent to 4
percent.
   Differences from state to state ``may reflect differences either
in the availability and use of ... cholesterol testing or in the
respondents' awareness of the results,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said.

<HEAD>Emperor Celebrates 87th Birthday, Reflects On Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people shouted ``Banzai'' and waved
Japanese flags as Emperor Hirohito, the world's oldest and
longest-reigning monarch, appeared briefly on his palace balcony
today to mark his 87th birthday.
   The emperor's birthday is a national holiday.
   ``Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me today. I am
happy that so many of you have come today. I hope you will all have
a happy future,'' Hirohito said from behind bullet-proof glass in a
speech carried live on national television.
   It was his second public appearance since he underwent surgery
last September to bypass a tumor blocking his digestive tract.
Doctors later said the growth was not malignant.
   Hirohito, once worshiped as a living god, also spoke to
well-wishers at the Imperial Palace grounds on New Year's Day.
   Nobuyoshi Shimane, an accountant in Tokyo, was one of the
estimated 35,000 who came in three shifts under a drizzling rain
today and stood in a palace courtyard to see the emperor in his
annual birthday appearance.
   ``I think this will be the last chance to see him because of his
advanced age,'' Shimane said.
   Hirohito has been on the throne since Dec. 25, 1926.
   Despite rumors of ill health, Hirohito appeared relatively
strong today, although he shuffled slowly as he walked. He was
accompanied by Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko and other
members of the imperial family. Missing was Empress Nagako, 85, who
suffers back and leg ailments.
   In a news conference marking his birthday, the emperor said he
was recovering well from surgery and answered questions about his
memories of World War II.
   ``After all is considered, the war was my most unpleasant
memory. I am pleased with people's efforts for peace after the war.
Hereafter, I hope the people do not forget this matter and protect
peace,'' Hirohito said.
   He refused to say what caused Japan to enter the war in the
first place, saying, ``I do not want to answer the question because
this will involve criticism against persons.''
   Foreign reporters were not alowed to attend the news conference,
which was conducted Monday but not released until today. The
remarks were carried in Japanese by the Kyodo News Service and
translated by The Associated Press.
   During two previous news conferences for foreign reporters _ the
last 13 years ago _ the emperor expressed his personal sorrow for
``certain things'' that happened during World War II.
   But he said he acted as a constitutional monarch before and
during the war and did not play a personal role. He also denied
planning the Pearl Harbor attack, but left many other questions
unanswered.
   During this year's news conference, Hirohito praised Yoshihiro
Tokugawa, his former grand chamberlain who retired earlier this
month at the age of 81 after serving for more than half a century.
   ``He protected recordings of the emperor's announcement of
defeat in the war (from soldiers who intruded into the Imperial
Palace on Aug. 15, 1945). With his language abilities, he prepared
well for my friendly visits to Europe and the United States so that
my visits were successful.''
   Soldiers had planned to seize the recording so the war could
continue. They beat Tokugawa with a pistol, but he refused to say
where the recording was hidden. When the disk was finally played,
it was the first time most Japanese heard their emperor's voice.
   During that broadcast, Hirohito urged his subjects ``to open an
era of grand peace for the generations to come, by suffering the
insufferable, bearing the unbearable.''
   However, Hirohito never used the words ``surrender'' or
``defeat.''
   Hirohito also said in the interview that it would take him a
long time to complete his research in marine biology, his favorite
hobby.
   He said he had replanted an endangered plant species and ``it is
growing well because the imperial garden is similar to forest
land.''

<HEAD>Keepers Watch Condor Chick Through Dime-Sized Hole</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first California condor chick conceived in
captivity pecked a dime-sized hole in its egg, which anxious
keepers gently poked and serenaded with recorded vulture sounds to
coax the rare bird out of its shell.
   The chick should free itself by early Saturday, said Tom
Hanscom, spokesman at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, where the
chick was conceived by the only known active breeding pair of the
nearly extinct California condors.
   ``(The hole) makes our condor people's job easier,'' Hanscom
said. ``They've been monitoring the chick's activity by close
observation to detect movement of egg itself. Now with a direct
view of the chick, we can tell every time it moves.''
   The chick dislodged the dime-sized bit of shell Thursday on its
second day of pecking at the egg, accompanied by a recording of
vultures making hissing and grunting sounds. The recording was
played at two-hour intervals to try to duplicate the sounds the
chick would hear in a natural nesting environment.
   Condor keepers also occasionally tap the egg lightly with a
metal rod to match the prodding encouragement of a parent condor.
   ``We are still getting response from the egg when we tap and
play vulture sounds,'' Hanscom said. ``We are happy at the
response. It indicates to us the chick is still alive and strong.
At this point, we just to continue to watch.''
   Park officials have set a 72-hour deadline _ ending at 4 a.m.
Saturday _ at which time keepers will intervene with forceps and
tweezers and gently chip small parks of the shell until they can
pull the chick out, he said.
   Officials don't want to intervene prematurely because of the
danger of rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes, which
could trigger fatal internal bleeding.
   ``It's an exciting time but a very anxious time,'' said Hanscom.
``We do fear for over-exhaustion on the part of the chick. We'll
all breathe a lot easier when we have a chick out of its shell and
it indicates to us it is healthy and functioning correctly.''
   The 10-ounce egg, about 5 inches long, has been under a 24-hour
watch since 4 a.m. Wednesday, when keepers noticed cracks in one
end. The ``pip'' cracks signaled the start of hatching, which
usually takes about three days.
   A successful hatching would bring to 28 the known population of
North America's largest land bird, a member of the vulture family
with a wing span of 10 feet at maturity. All 27 California condors
known to exist are in captivity _ 14 at the Wild Animal Park and 13
at the Los Angeles Zoo.

   Passengers aboard a stricken Aloha
Airlines jetliner prayed and sang hymns while the plane wobbled 25
miles to an emergency landing after an explosion blew away part of
the forward passenger cabin's overhead.
   ``There was big bang when it happened and everybody looked up
and we were looking at blue sky,'' Bill Fink of Honolulu said
Thursday. He was in row 18, not far from the Boeing 737's forward
cabin where the explosion occurred.
   ``Everybody screamed,'' said passenger Dan Dennin of Honolulu.
``However, it was very brief _ the panic. The explosion happened,
the rest of the plane was intact, and we did not go into any
unusual attitudes or anything like that.''
   Sixty people were injured, two critically, and a stewardess was
missing in the explosion aboard the jetliner, which landed at
Kahului Airport with one engine aflame and about 15 to 20 feet of
its front cabin exposed. The plane carried 89 passengers, five crew
members and an air traffic controller.
   ``I think that people realized the plane was still flying and
they quickly went about the business of doing whatever they could
do to save their lives,'' Dennin said. ``I think we flew for almost
15 minutes with half an airplane, so we were all well aware of what
was going on.''
   Fink and Dennin praised the cabin crew for helping calm the
passengers, some of whom hung on to one standing stewardess so she
would not be sucked out of the plane by the howling wind.
   Another stewardess, Clarabelle B. Lansing of Honolulu, who
worked for the airline for 37 years, apparently was swept from the
plane, officials said. An air and sea search coordinated by the
U.S. Coast Guard failed to locate her. The search was scheduled to
resume at first light today.
   ``Well, I think the stewardess (Mrs. Lansing) had just picked up
the microphone to start talking,'' when the explosion occurred,
Fink said.
   Another passenger, Alice Godwin of Boulder City, Nev., said the
wind was so strong she was thankful no infant was aboard the plane
because the child would have been blown away.
   Ms. Godwin said that after the explosion she put on a life
jacket and placed her head between her knees.
   ``We all prayed,'' Ms. Godwin said. ``As long as those engines
were running, the more secure I felt. I sang all the hymns I knew.
That kept me busy.''
   ``I'm alive! I'm alive!'' David Jackson of Hawaii shouted as a
nurse pushed his wheelchair through the hospital.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Ship Attack Off Iranian Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today its warplanes raided two
vessels off the Iranian coast, resuming attacks on commercial
shipping in the Persian Gulf after nearly a month of quiet.
   Baghdad Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the warplanes staged
two raids late Thursday, hitting ``a very large maritime target and
a large maritime target,'' a usual reference to supertankers and
tankers.
   The broadcast quoted an unidentified military spokesman as
saying the planes rerturned safely to base after scoring ``accurate
and effective blows.'' He said the missions were designed to
``destroy the oil supplies of the aggressors who use the oil
revenues to prolong the war.''
   There was no immediate confirmation of either attack from
gulf-based shipping executives.
   Iran never acknowledges Iraqi attacks on vessels ferrying its
oil between the Kharg island oil terminal at the northern tip of
the gulf and safer facilities in the southern part of the waterway.
   Iraq has claimed sinking Iranian warships in the gulf during a
land thrust earlier this month to recapture the Faw peninsula in
southern Iraq.
   But the last confirmed Iraqi attack on a commercial vessel was
March 30, when the Cypriot-flagged Anax was damaged in an air raid
about 70 miles south of Kharg.
   Iran is known to have attacked at least seven ships between
April 12-23.
   The so-called ``tanker war'' is an offshoot of the Iran-Iraq war
that began in September 1980.

   A man crippled by multiple sclerosis died
after his power wheelchair caught fire while other wheelchair-bound
residents of a home for the disabled looked on in horror,
authorities said.
   Basil A. Vlahopulos, 37, died Wednesday night before
firefighters arrived at Hollister House. The building's automatic
sprinkler system doused the flames.
   The cause of the fire is undetermined, but is believed to be
accidental, fire investigators said.
   Nina Dalton, a wheelchair-bound neighbor of Vlahopulos', said
she watched as a woman and a man in a wheelchair opened a door
found smoke pouring from the apartment where Vlahopulos lived.
   ``When the fire alarms went off, it scared me to death,'' Ms.
Dalton said.
   Vlahopulos came to Cincinnati from Greece planning to learn to
be a family counselor. In 1980, he was diagnosed as having multiple
sclerosis and he was in a wheelchair a year later.
   But Vlahopulos earned a doctorate in counseling from the
University of Cincinnati. His sister, Maria O'Hearn of Norfolk,
Va., said Thursday her brother worked with agencies that help the
handicapped.

<HEAD>Roh To Reoganize Government Following Election Setback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo plans a major
overhaul of of his government and party, which lost its
parliamentary majority in a stunning election setback, his aides
said today.
   Roh plans to replace several senior Cabinet and party officials
to apportion blame for the election defeat and to give the
administration a more moderate image, the aides said.
   Presidential aides, who spoke on condition they not be
identified further, said the changes in the government and the
Democratic Justice Party are expected to come as early as next week.
   One aide said the reorganization would be ``extensive,''
affecting presidential advisers and Cabinet posts, including the
ministries of Justice and Home Affairs. Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae
would not be affected, he said.
   Government and governing party officials said the strong
opposition showing in Tuesday's National Assembly elections has
forced them to change strategy, to seek dialogue and compromise.
   ``Reform through dialogue would be a new form of politics,'' the
aide said.
   Victims of the reorganization may include Ahn Moo-hyuk, director
of the Agency for National Security Planning, who was retained from
the government of former President Chun Doo-hwan, another aide said.
   The intelligence agency came under fire for alleged attempts to
smear some important opposition candidates in Tuesday's elections.
   An extensive reorganization of the governing party is
inevitable. Chairman Chae Moon-shik and other top officials offered
to resign to take responsibility for the humiliating election
setback, the Roh aides said.
   In Tuesday's balloting, opposition candidates left the governing
party without a parliamentary majority for the first time in South
Korea's 40-year history.
   Three opposition parties secured 164 seats in the 299-member
National Assembly. The Democratic Justice Party won 125 seats and
independents took 10.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, whose Party for Peace and
Democracy emerged as the main opposition party with 71 seats in
Tuesday's election, said today that he ``would not oppose
everything the government proposes.''
   ``We will cooperate as long as the Roh regime carries out its
promised democratic reforms,'' Kim told reporters.
   Projecting a moderate image, the 62-year-old opposition leader
said he would also cooperate to insure a successful staging of the
1988 Olympic Games, opening in Seoul in September.
   Kim said he would ask the Seoul government to be ``magnanimous''
and allow North Korea to take part in the Olympics.
   He said he has some ideas on ways of persuading North Korea to
participate in the Games, but refused to disclose details before
consultation with the government in May.
   Kim also welcomed a proposal for a united anti-Roh coalition in
the Assembly. He said he would closely cooperate with rival
opposition leaders Kim Young-sam of the Reunification Democratic
Party and Kim Jong-pil of the New Democratic Republican Party.
   The three Kims, who won parliamentary seats in Tuesday's
elections, said they would meet next week to work out a new
anti-government strategy.
   Party officials said the three Kims then will propose a meeting
with Roh that government officials say Roh will welcome.
   With Kim Dae-jung and Kim Youmg-sam splitting the opposition
vote, Roh won just 36.6 percent of the vote in December's election,
the country's first direct presidential balloting in 16 years.

<HEAD>Polls Give Edge to Mitterrand After Debate With Chirac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand was judged today the
winner of an acrimonious debate with rival conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac televised 10 days before voters return to the polls
for the presidential runoff.
   Thirty-two percent of television viewers gave the socialist
president the edge and 24 percent said Chirac had won Thursday
night's debate. Twenty-one percent called it a draw, 23 percent had
no opinion.
   The poll of 800 adults was conducted immediately after the
debate by the private firm CSA for the newpaper Le Parisien and
Radio France. No margin of error was given.
   Often biting and sarcastic, the debate was the first between
Mitterand and Chirac since they began sharing power in March 1986.
The two drew on detailed figures and weaved sophisticated arguments
in attacking each other's policies.
   Newspapers across France featured the debate on their front
pages today.
   ``With this face to face debate, Francois Mitterrand and Jacques
Chirac confirmed that cohabitation has been more difficult than
either had let be understood before,'' the provincial daily
Courrier de l'Ouest said.
   The leftist daily Liberation said the debate: ``recalled a
quarrel on a luxurious school playground.''
   The conservative Le Figaro, like most newspapers, said it showed
the men to be fairly evenly matched.
   Chirac used the debate to make a clear appeal to the extreme
right, arguing that halting immigration was ``an imperious
necessity.''
   Mitterrand agreed that immigration must be reduced but said he
would not take part in a ``witchhunt of immigrants.''
   For Chirac, 55, the key to winning the May 8 runoff election
could lie with capturing the votes of those who favor Jean-Marie Le
Pen, leader of the extreme-right National Front.
   Le Pen, running on an anti-immigration platform, achieved a
stunning success in Sunday's first round of the presidential
elections, garnering 14.4 percent of the vote, compared to 19.9
percent for Chirac.
   Mitterrand, 71, won with 34 percent.
   On Sunday, Le Pen is to advise his sympathizers how to vote on
May 8.
   He has publicly ruled out votes in Mitterrand's favor. But he
has said he is looking for concrete signs Chirac and his
neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic would implement policies in
keeping with the National Front's goals.
   Thursday night's two-hour forum, in which two well-known
journalists asked the questions, was billed as the major political
event.
   The number of immigrants ``must of course be reduced,''
Mitterrand said during the exchange. But he added that immigration
was ``an exaggerated problem, sometimes purposely complicated ...
that cannot be treated without nuance.''
   ``I will not participate during this presidential election in a
witchhunt of immigrants,'' he said.
   ``Very simply, immigration must be stopped because France no
longer has the means to give work to foreigners,'' Chirac said.
``It is an imperious necessity.''
   Using a term dear to Le Pen, he added, ``It's a problem of
national identity, of the French way of life.''
   ``You didn't wink there, did you?'' Mitterrand interjected.
   The president appeared to command the first half of the debate,
but Chirac responded confidently and with animation on the subjects
of immigration, taxes and security.

   Sikh militants inside the Golden Temple
exchanged gunfire with paramilitary troops holding one of their
comrades outside the holy shrine today, security officials said.
   One woman visiting the temple was injured in the clash, police
said.
   Police were put on alert throughout the city to counter any
further violence, said Baldev Singh, the police superintendent.
   Nand Lal, commander of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police
Force, said the militants opened fire after a patrol spotted and
tried to stop a wanted Sikh radical as he was heading for the
shrine.
   ``As soon as the gunmen inside the Golden Temple saw us holding
one of their comrades, we were fired upon,'' Lal said. The patrol
returned the fire, he said, and rounds were exchanged for about 20
minutes.
   The Sikh militant, whose name was not given, escaped during the
melee and took shelter inside the temple complex, Lal said.
   The militants were recently reported building bunkers and firing
ports inside the complex, which includes the temple, offices and
guest quarters. It is Sikhism's holiest shrine.
   Security forces have entered the complex on occasion, but they
generally try to avoid it because their presence would offend
devout Sikhs.
   On Thursday, Sikh extremists killed 16 people in separate
attacks throughout Punjab, including raids on two villages and a
farm, security officials said.
   Villagers captured one of the gunmen, but police said the
suspect committed suicide by taking a poison capsule while in
custody, the United News of India reported.
   The slayings raised to at least 850 the number of killings
blamed on Sikh militants in Punjab this year.
   Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed
to the extremists' 6-year-old guerrilla campaign for an independent
homeland in the northern state.
   S.S. Virk, deputy inspector general of the paramilitary Central
Reserve Police Force, said as many as 12 Sikh militants took part
in a raid late Thursday on the village of Ranpura, 30 miles south
of Amritsar.
   He said the gunmen ordered Hindus out of their homes and fatally
shot five of them, including a 17-year-old girl.
   Virk said a letter left at the scene claimed responsibility on
behalf of the Bhindranwale Tiger Force, one of a dozen Sikh
militant groups operating in Punjab.
   Two other Hindus were killed Thursday night by Sikh gunmen in
Mohamadpura village, 18 miles west of Amritsar, police said.
   Sikh radicals also were blamed for a raid on a Sikh farmer's
house in the district late Thursday in which four people, including
a 12-year-old boy, were killed.
   Five other deaths were reported in scattered attacks.
   Sikhs, whose 500-year-old religion has roots in Hinduism and
Islam, claim they are discriminated against by India's majority
Hindus. They make up less than 2 percent of India's 800 million
population but are a majority in Punjab.

   A police sergeant killed during a raid on an
alleged cocaine den was shot by one of two decorated police
officers, not the pregnant woman blamed immediately after the
shootout, authorities said.
   ``In these kinds of incidents, it's a little difficult to piece
things together,'' Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo told a news
conference Thursday. ``We got most of our information from the
captain, who unfortunately was the last one in the room.''
   Police backed off their earlier version after ballistic tests
showed the bullet that killed Sgt. John F. McCormick came from one
of the two Smith & Wesson revolvers used by police officers who
were at the shooting.
   The bullet was recovered during an autopsy on McCormick, 43, a
19-year veteran who was nearing retirement. McCormick was shot in a
room outside the bedroom where suspect Mercedes Perez scuffled with
police.
   The fatal shot was fired by either Officer John Huvane, 26, or
Officer James Curran, 28, police sources said. Curran has won 35
awards for his performance on duty; Huvane has received six awards.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward, who angrily demanded the
death penalty for Ms. Perez after Wednesday's shooting, was
``distressed and concerned'' when he learned a police bullet had
killed McCormick.
   But Colangelo defended Ward, who was not at Thursday's news
conference. ``The police commissioner yesterday made a generalized
statement, which still holds true,'' Colangelo said.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Ms. Perez was still to blame for the
death, and ``the tragedy is a police officer was killed as a result
of the actions taken by drug pushers. ...
   ``So, while she didn't shoot him directly, she's directly
responsible,'' Koch said.
   Ms. Perez, who was shot twice during the spray of gunfire, gave
birth to a baby girl after being taken to Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center. Both mother and child were in stable condition.
   Ms. Perez has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated
assault, criminal possession of a controlled substance and a
weapons violation.
   McCormick, of the Bronx Narcotics Unit, was among a team of
police officers who broke down the door of Ms. Perez's apartment in
upper Manhattan. A search warrant said they were looking for 4{
pounds of cocaine.
   A subsequent search of the apartment turned up scales, four
vials of crack, one marijuana cigarette, half an ounce of white
powder believed to be cocaine, $2,000 in cash, drug sale records
and an assortment of bullets, police said.

<HEAD>Former Convict Who Lived 27-Year Lie Acquitted Of Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former convict who hid his
criminal past for 27 years while he became a civic leader and
businessman was acquitted of fraud and grand theft charges brought
by investors upset over his fake background.
   Robert L. Gipson, 70, had been living under an assumed name for
years and had settled into a busy civic-oriented life here before
his past was disclosed three years ago.
   ``The nightmare is over,'' Gipson said after the Wednesday
verdict in Pasco Circuit Court that cleared him of three theft
counts and one of fraud.
   Gipson's past caught up to him in 1985 when he was revealed to
be convicted felon Gilbert E. Sharby, arrested in at least seven
states on various charges ranging from grand larceny to
impersonating a federal officer.
   The disclosure cost Gipson his job on the Pasco County
Republican Party Executive Committee and left him scrambling to
restore a carefully nurtured reputation as a good citizen. He
gained a federal pardon and one from Nebraska authorities, then had
his civil rights restored by former Gov. Bob Graham.
   But in January 1987, Gipson was arrested after three investors
in his Port Richey locksmith business claimed they wouldn't have
parted with $9,000 had they known Gipson's background.
   The trial focused on whether Gipson deceived three people he met
through the Republican Party at a November 1984 stock sales meeting.
   The state claimed that through his false identity, Gipson
misrepresented himself to the investors. Among other credentials,
Gipson claimed he had degrees from Harvard University, the
University of Kansas and the University of California at Berkeley.
   Etta Breitenbach invested $5,000, Sylvia Wolan $1,000 and
Charles Weber $3,000.
   Defense attorney Marc Salton did not dispute evidence that
Gipson, a former local Chamber of Commerce executive, was a high
school dropout who had a gift of gab and a lengthy record. But he
maintained that Gipson's past was irrevelant to the investors'
commitments in Gipson's Suncoast Locksmiths Corp.
   ``You don't have to have any education to run a locksmith
business,'' Salton said. ``You have to be a good locksmith.''
   He characterized the unhappy investors as ``people who didn't
make as much money as they wanted to make.''

<HEAD>Swiss Family Frey Flees Indonesian Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARWIN, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss missionary pilot said today
that fear of the Indonesian army caused him and his family to flee
the island of New Guinea and fly a small plane more than 1,000
miles to a remote airstrip in Australia.
   Theo Frey and his family fled Irian Jaya, the Indonesian-held
territory adjoining Papua New Guinea.
   The family arrived Wednesday at Nhilunbuy, an airstrip in
Australia's sparsely populated Northern Territory. Their
single-engine Cessna 182 touched down after a five-hour flight,
almost empty of fuel.
   Frey said he feared for his family's safety and flew to
Australia with his wife Martha and 16-year-old daughter Sandra
because it was the nearest refuge.
   There was no immediate comment from Jakarta on Frey's assertion
of harrassment during his work as a pilot for the Lutheran Church's
Associated Mission Air service.
   Frey refused to give further details, saying, ``We must consider
our friends in Indonesia. All we want to do is go back to
Switzerland.''
   Frey said he spent six months in Irian Jaya, where indigenous
Melanesian separatists are trying to overthrow Indonesian rule.
   Newspaper reports said Indonesian authorities suspected Frey of
``spotting'' for Free West Papua Movement rebels operating in Irian
Jaya. The movement has been waging a guerilla struggle against
Indonesian rule over the territory since the early 1960s.
   In Jakarta today, the newspaper Biznis Indonesia quoted the head
of the air service, T. Stegen, as saying ``internal problems''
might have caused Frey to abandon his job and flee with the plane.
He did not elaborate.
   Indonesians have resettled an estimated 2 million people from
Indonesia's densely populated Java island to the territory. The
movement claims the migration is depriving native Melanesians of
national identity and economic, social and educational
opportunities.
   Immigration officials granted Frey and his family temporary
one-month visas because they arrived without passports or clearance
papers.

<HEAD>Big Mac To Attack Moscow Next Year; Soviets Predict Burgeoning
Burger Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviets will get a chance to munch ``Bolshoi
Macs'' when the first of about 20 McDonald's restaurants in Moscow
opens next year, officials from the city and the hamburger giant
announced today.
   ``I think that the McDonald's in Moscow will be the highest
volume McDonald's in the world,'' said George A. Cohon, president
of McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd., a subsidiary of
McDonald's Corp. of Oak Brook, Ill.
   Cohon and Vladimir I. Malishkov, chief of the food service
administration of the Moscow City Council, signed a joint venture
agreement today at Moscow's city hall at a ceremony attended by
reporters.
   The agreement, which gives McDonald's of Canada a 49 percent
share in the Soviet-controlled firm, is the latest Soviet joint
business venture with a foreign company.
   Last year, the Soviet government modified its legislation on
foreign business activity in an attempt to woo foreign capital,
technology and expertise. The reform is part of changes enacted
under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev designed to increase the
quality and quantity of consumer goods.
   Malishkov and Moscow Deputy Mayor Valery A. Zharov said the
Soviets hope to draw upon the expertise of the fast-food chain to
improve service in their country's food industry.
   The first Soviet McDonald's, a 650-seat location on Gorky Street
in the center of Moscow, is expected to open in the second half of
1989. But Cohon and the city officials refused to say exactly where
the site is.
   ``We don't want to create any lines,'' Zharov said with a smile.
   At that restaurant, Soviets will be able to buy a Big Mac, the
chain's trademark hamburger sandwich, for 2 rubles, or about $3.
   Another Moscow location is projected that would cater to
foreigners paying in foreign currencies.
   ``We're not thinking of just opening 20 McDonald's in this
country,'' Cohon said. ``There will be many more.''
   Cohon said a 100,000-square foot commissary would be built in
Moscow to process french fries, meat, buns, sauces and pies served
in the restaurants.
   Both Cohon and the Soviets said most of the joint venture's
employees would be Soviet citizens, but that there would be some
foreigners in supervisory and management positions.
   Cohon said that through ``burger diplomacy,'' workers in the
joint venture would learn to communication and become part of a
team.
   As of the signing ceremony, what the Moscow McDonald's will call
the chain's flagship sandwich appears to be undecided. An
interpreter referred both to a ``Big Mac' and a ``Bolshoi Mac.'' In
Russian, ``bolshoi'' means big.
   The foreign capital for the joint venture comes from McDonald's
of Canada, which has 500 restaurants, 54,000 employees, and
registered $1.25 billion in sales last year, Cohon said.
   McDonald's branched into Eastern Europe on March 24, when it
opened a restaurant in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. It plans to open a
restaurant this month in Budapest, Hungary, making that East bloc
nation the 50th country around the world to have a McDonald's.
   Company founder Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald's on April
15, 1955 in Des Plaines, Ill.

<HEAD>Christian Democrats Meet Amid Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bitterly divided Christian
Democrats gather today to consider who will be their presidential
candidate and how to prevent the governing party from falling apart
at the seams.
   The centrist party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, among
America's closest allies in the hemisphere, is suffering one of the
worst crises in its 28-year history.
   It was resoundingly defeated by the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, in legislative and municipal
elections March 20 and appears on the verge of collapse.
   About 1,800 party members are meeting at a hotel in this capital
to discuss who will be their candidate in presidential elections
scheduled for next March.
   Duarte on Tuesday called on the two main rivals _ Julio Rey
Prendes and Fidel Chavez Mena _ to abandon their candidacies for
the sake of party unity. The bitter year-old battle between them
for the nomination has left at least two people dead and several
wounded.
   Chavez Mena and Rey Prendes, both party founders and former
Cabinet members, rejected the president's suggestion on Wednesday
and said they would continue their efforts.
   Duarte proposed Abraham Rodriguez, the party's unsuccessful
presidential candidate in 1967 elections, as a unity nominee.
   The party congress was to have endorsed a candidate in a
non-binding vote and a party convention of 220 delegates had been
expected to then make the final, binding decision.
   But Duarte urged members of the congress and delegates to the
convention not to make their final choice today. It remained to be
seen if his suggestion would be heeded.
   Duarte, who is limited by law to one five-year term, warned that
``we are threatening our very existence from within the party.''
   Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
San Salvador, seconded that assessment during a talk with foreign
journalists Thursday.
   He said the Christian Democrats should resolve the crisis ``in a
peaceful manner if they want to survive as a party. Otherwise the
division will lead them to self-destruction.''

hospital, staff members said.
   The six rescued patients were treated for smoke inhalation
Thursday night in the emergency center of Ealing Hospital and were
in satisfactory condition. No other injuries were reported.
   Dr. Raphael Eban, unit general manager of the hospital's general
wing, said the fire caused substantial damage to a section of the
psychiatric ward.
   Police and fire officials were investigating the cause, Eban
said.
   ``Some of the patients were so confused they wanted to carry on
watching television in smoke-filled rooms,'' said John Norris,
divisional officer of the London Fire Brigade.

   About 10,000 people left homeless by
one of the capital's biggest fires in 40 years pitched camp along
railroad tracks near their razed shantytown, officials said today.
   About 300 children were evacuated to an elementary school in
Pandacan district, the crowded neighborhood where officials said
Thursday's fire destroyed more than 1,000 shacks and left 10,000
homeless.
   Relief workers distributed rice and canned fish today and set up
a community kitchen for the victims, social welfare officials said.
   An arson investigator, Sgt. Jimmy Molina, said police were still
trying to determine the cause of the fire.
   Brig. Gen. Ernesto Madriaga, the fire chief, said the flames
destroyed a candy factory warehouse and virtually every building in
a 25-acre area. The fire broke out about 1{ miles from the
presidential palace.
   Madriaga said the blaze was ``possibly the biggest in Manila
since World War II,'' and that a shift in the winds prevented the
fire from reaching a nearby oil storage area. His deputy said
flames spread within eight yards of the state-owned Philippine
National Oil Co.'s depot.
   Firefighters were unable to move trucks into the crowded
shantytown alleys and concentrated their efforts on preventing the
fire from reaching the oil storage area.
   Troops armed with M-16 rifles were sent to the fire scene after
residents, angry that firefighters were not trying to save their
homes, pelted firetrucks with stones.

<HEAD>Voyagers Warned To Avoid Ports As Strike Enters Fourth Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vacationers heading for the European continent by
water were warned today to expect delays of up to 18 hours as a
long weekend approached and a ferry strike entered its fourth day.
   Problems on the busy Dover-Calais route across the English
Channel began this week when crews of the Sealink car-and-passenger
ferry company refused to cross picket lines mounted by workers of
another ferry firm, P and O, who have been on strike for three
months.
   Sealink management and representatives of the 24,400-member
National Union of Seamen met today through government mediators to
seek a compromise after Sealink sought to curb the strike by having
the union's assets seized.
   Sealink said only its French-crewed ships were sailing, halving
the number of daily round trips to eight.
   No delays were reported this morning, but police cordoned off
lanes of the highway into Dover to accommodate trucks likely to be
stranded.
   ``Today and Saturday are expected to be very busy,'' said a
Sealink statement. It warned that motorists with bookings could
experience delays of about six hours later today.
   The statement said bus passengers could be delayed for up to 18
hours, while truck drivers faced even longer waits.
   Hovercraft services between the English port of Folkstone and
the French port of Boulogne were normal but packed, said Sealink
spokesman Russell Stenhouse. The longer Newhaven-Dieppe and
Weymouth-Cherbourg routes linking Britain and France also were
reported to be unaffected, but Sealink's Wales-Ireland crossings
were disrupted.
   The action came on one of the travel industry's busiest
weekends. Monday is a legal holiday in Britain and Sealink usually
carries 150,000 passengers between Britain and France.
   P and O seamen have been on strike for 12 weeks, resisting an
ultimatum on new pay rules and working conditions.
   This week, P and O strikers mounted pickets at Dover, the
world's busiest ferry port, and Sealink crews have refused to cross
them since Tuesday.
   A woman who crossed the line had ``scab'' daubed on her home in
red paint.
   Under union-curbing laws enacted by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government, secondary picketing is illegal, and
employers can sue the union involved for damages.
   On Thursday, Sealink made the first move in that direction by
asking the High Court to order the seamen's union assets seized.
   The union threatened an all-out strike if its funds were seized.
   Judge Michael Davies urged Sealink and the union to ``talk, and
talk fast'' before he adjourned the case for a day.

<TEXT>
   Police stepped up security
after reports that Palestinian terrorists were planning to bomb a
U.S. air base and bars frequented by American servicemen, officials
said today.
   Angeles City police chief Lt. Col. Orlando Macaspac told
reporters the attacks were to be carried out during the weekend by
eight Palestinians, and that four of them already were in Angeles
City, 50 miles north of Manila.
   Macaspac said the report was relayed Thursday to the Philippine
Constabulary's Metropolitan District Command by the Israeli
intelligence service Mossad.
   He said Clark Air Base and bars frequented by U.S. military
personnel were the intended targets of the attacks.
   Clark officials could not be contacted immediately for comment,
but Macaspac said command officials were discussing security
arrangements with Filipino and American authorities on the base.
   There was no unusual security activity visible on the base.
Macaspac said Filipino police had stepped up patrols around the
city, especially in housing areas for American personnel.
   Spokesmen for both the Israeli and U.S. embassies said they had
no knowledge of the purported Israeli intelligence report. A
sergeant who answered the telephone at Clark's information office
declined comment.
   U.S. officials had tightened security around Clark, Subic Naval
Base and four smaller installations after communist rebels killed
three Americans and a Filipino in attacks near Clark in October.
   In December, there were also reports that Palestinian terrorists
had slipped into the country for a series of attacks here, but none
materialized.
   Officials say there are up to 30,000 Palestinians in the
Philippines, many of them in the country illegally. They include
students, businessmen and tourists, officials say.

<HEAD>Cuba Says Number of `Counterrevolutionary' Prisoners Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba is holding fewer political prisoners
since the United Nations took up the issue of human rights in Cuba
last month, the country's attorney general said.
   ``I don't have the exact figure at this moment, but I can say
that figure now is lower,'' Attorney General Ramon de la Cruz said
in an interview Thursday with the Cuban government news agency
Prensa Latina.
   The dispatch from Havana, received here, said Cuban Deputy
Foreign Minister Raul Roa Kouri had used the figure of 458
``counterrevolutionary prisoners'' during the meeting in Geneva,
Switzerland.
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission addressed the situation in Cuba
during a six-week session that ended March 11.
   Prensa Latina said the attorney general was asked if penal code
reforms scheduled to take effect April 30 would benefit prisoners
being held for crimes against state security.
   ``The policy that is followed with them is different,'' de la
Cruz was quoted as replying. ``It obeys a program that relates
release with emigration to the United States.''
   He noted that an agreement has been made on that subject with
Roman Catholic bishops of the United States.
   New York Cardinal John O'Connor said last week on a visit to
Havana that Cuban President Fidel Castro indicated that hundreds of
political prisoners could be freed from Cuban jails if the United
States gave them visas.
   During the meeting in Switzerland, the U.N. Human Rights
Commission accepted Castro's invitation to send its first
delegation to Cuba to investigate allegations of human rights
abuses.
   Cuba denies allegations from the United States, Amnesty
International and others of torture and mistreatment of political
prisoners.
   De la Cruz also said in the interview that the death penalty
remains in force in the new code.
   He said, however, that all legal actions take place in Cuba
within the law. ``We never have used nor will we use, as happens in
some Latin American countries, disappearances, illegal
executions,'' the attorney general said.

<HEAD>Rebels Urge West To Exploit Vietnam's Need for Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian guerrillas said the West
should exploit Vietnam's urgent requests for food aid to increase
pressure for the withdrawal of 140,000 Vietnamese troops from
Cambodia.
   ``If aid is given ... it would be like a transfusion of fresh
blood into the body of a blood-starved Vietnam writhing in its
death throes, thus reviving it and enabling it to carry on its war
of aggression in Cambodia,'' said the text of a guerrilla
broadcast, obtained today from a Western embassy in Bangkok.
   ``We appeal to them instead to take advantage of this moment ..
. to bring greater pressure to bear on it and force it to quickly
end its war of aggression in Cambodia,'' said the Tuesday broadcast.
   The broadcast came over the radio of the Khmer Rouge, the
largest of three guerrilla groups fighting Vietnamese troops that
invaded Cambodia in late 1978. A Western diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, recently said Vietnamese officials appealed
for aid in a March 14 meeting in Hanoi with representatives of
foreign countries and relief agencies.
   According to official Vietnamese media reports, bad weather,
disease, and insect plagues also have seriously damaged the rice
crop early this year.
   Rice is the staple crop in Vietnam. Aid officials say they see
no signs of starvation on any significant scale but there is
widespread malnutrition.
   The Western envoy said the Vietnamese officials asked for
fertilizer and insecticides to protect this year's harvests. The
envoy said that would cost about $100 million and it was doubtful
the international community would be able to provide it.
   The envoy, based in Hanoi, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier this month, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach
suggested to visiting Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., that food aid
could be offered to peasants in areas where they were asked to help
search for remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. The
State Department said it was outraged at the suggestion the two
issues should be linked.
   The Khmer Rouge broadcast said the food shortages were due not
to mistakes in agricultural policy, as the Vietnamese government
has claimed, but to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in an attempt to
dominate all of Indochina.
   The Khmer Rouge governed Cambodia from 1975 to 1978, and an
estimated 1 million to 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people
died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.

<HEAD>Billy Graham Sees Better Future For China's Christians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American evangelist Billy Graham said today he
was encouraged by the growing but still limited religious freedom
in China and was optimistic about Christianity's future in the
communist nation.
   Graham also said he had been unable to substantiate reports that
a Chinese itinerant preacher who spreads the Gospel in defiance of
the state-sponsored church was arrested after arriving in Beijing
to hear the Southern Baptist minister.
   Graham, speaking at a news conference in this British colony at
the end of his 16-day visit to China, said he contacted high-level
Chinese authorities and the U.S. Embassy to get information about
the reported arrest of Xu Yongzhe, but received neither
verification nor denial of the report.
   ``My wife and I have been praying daily for him if he indeed has
been detained,'' Graham said. He said he could not intervene in the
matter but could ``relate my feelings about it and I have already
done that.'' He did not elaborate.
   According to the director of the Chinese Church Research Center
in Hong Kong, Xu was arrested April 16 after traveling to Beijing
from central China to hear Graham. The center has links to
Protestants in China who worship in unofficial ``house churches.''
   A source in Beijing with links to preachers outside the
state-sanctioned church has confirmed Xu's arrest.
   Graham said he did not know Xu and had not heard of him before
his reported detention.
   The 69-year-old Graham spoke with government leaders and
Christians from inside and outside the official Chinese church
during his first China trip, which took him to Beijing, Nanking,
Shanghai and Canton.
   Christians form a tiny minority of China's 1 billion people. The
official Protestant church has about 4 million members, as does the
official Catholic church, which does not recognize Vatican
authority.
   Millions of other Christians are believed to practice their
faith independently in the privacy of their homes.
   Graham said some people told him of persecution during the
ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, during which religion
was banned. Graham also heard of Christians still suffering
discrimination in income, housing, education and social status
because of their faith.
   The evangelist said he was ``encouraged that there is now a
limited, I'd like you to underscore the word `limited,' ... measure
of religious freedom and that thousands of churches have reopened
in recent years. I expressed the hope there will be steady progress
toward greater religious freedom for all believers.''
   Graham said he was ``very optimistic about the future of the
Christian faith in China. Christians in China could be salt and
light in Chinese society, and could be a great moral and spiritual
force for good in the nation where God has placed them.''
   Graham said he would like to return to China but indicated he
probably would not speak before huge stadium crowds as he has done
in many of the nearly 70 other countries he has visited.

   Panamanian Gen. Antonio Manuel Noriega doesn't have
to surrender to U.S. authorities in order to challenge his drug
indictment, a federal judge has ruled.
   ``The best way to avoid the appearance that this indictment has
assumed the character of a political proceeding, rather than a
legal one, is to determine its legal validity upon the arguments of
counsel,'' U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said Thursday.
   The judge gave Noriega's attorney, Neal Sonnett, 10 days to
submit challenges to the Feb. 4 indictment. Hoeveler said he would
set a hearing date after the government responded.
   Sonnett hailed the ruling, which does not affect a separate
Noriega drug indictment in Tampa.
   ``I think it is an outstanding legal victory for Gen. Noriega,
and a well-reasoned opinion on the part of Judge Hoeveler,'' the
attorney said.
   The lead prosecutor in the case, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney
Richard Gregorie, was traveling Thursday and unavailable for
comment.
   Gregorie has said that if Noriega wants to challenge the
indictment he should surrender himself.
   Noriega is accused in the 12-count indictment of taking at least
$4.6 million in payoffs from members of the Medellin Cartel to
protect cocaine shipments, launder money, supply drug laboratories
and shelter the Colombian gang leaders from law enforcement.
   Sonnett, who has traveled to Panama to meet with Noriega, cited
New York draft resister cases in which attorneys were allowed to
make arguments while their clients were in Canada.
   The judge agreed, noting that the Justice Department ``has not
yet sought extraditon of Gen. Noriega, and it does not appear
likely that it will seek extradition in the near future.''
   In another development, it was disclosed Thursday that the
federal prosecutor whose office issued the Feb. 4 indictment naming
Noriega will resign June 17 and rejoin his former law firm.
   U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, whose office is responsible for the
southern district of Florida, the nation's busiest in terms of
caseload, will resign for personal reasons, said his executive
assistant, Ana Barnett.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita departed for
Western Europe today to meet with leaders of Italy, Britain and
West Germany in a bid to improve political and trade links with the
region.
   The prime minister is making his first trip to Europe since he
became prime minister in November, although he has visited Europe
seven times in other capacities.
   Takeshita told reporters Wednesday that there are imbalances in
Japan's relations with Europe and the United States.
   ``In the area of trade, it is true that significant imbalances
still exist,'' he said. ``It is necessary for us to turn the
existing structure of an uneven triangle into a right triangle.''
   Japan's trade with the European Economic Community accounted for
less than 10 percent, or $28.9 billion of the country's total trade
of $305 billion in 1985. Trade with the United States amounted to
$71.1 billion or 23.3 percent of the country's overall trade in the
same year, according to Japanese figures.
   At the same time, trade imbalances between Japan and the EEC
countries continued to grow.
   In 1987, Japan chalked up a surplus of $20 billion in trade with
the EEC, according to Finance Ministry statistics. In 1986, it was
$16.7 billion.
   Bowing to pressure from the EEC and Britain to lower tariffs and
non-tariff barriers, such as taxes and restrictions, on imported
liquor and wine, the Japanese government decided in January to
revise its liquor tax system to boost imports of foreign liquor.
   Trade relations have improved in recent months.
   Between January and March this year, Japanese imports from
Europe increased by 52.3 percent, Takeshita said.
   ``We wish to further encourage this trend,'' he added.
   During his 11-day trip, the Japanese leader will meet with Pope
John Paul II in the Vatican on April 30, and his Italian
counterpart Ciriaco DeMita in Rome on May 2. Then he will fly to
London on May 3 to meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
May 4.
   In London, Takeshita is scheduled to give a major speech on May
4 in a luncheon in The City, London's financial district, in which
he will outline his plan to have Japan play a larger role in world
affairs.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service said the ``Takeshita plan'' calls for
Japan to increase its official development assistance and to
provide money and personnel for United Nations peacekeeping forces.
   He will wrap up his tour with a meeting with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on May 5 and hold a press conference
on May 6. He will leave Munich, West Germany May 8 and return home
on May 9.
   Takeshita is also sceduled to visit France, Belgium and the
Netherlands in early June.

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
today urged President Reagan not to veto legislation requiring
companies to give notice before closing plants, telling union
members that workers ``deserve better from America.''
   ``I hope the president will take the time to think about the
three million American workers who lose their jobs in this country
every year through plant shutdowns,'' Dukakis said. ``In at least
half those cases, those plants shut down with little or no notice
to those most affected _ their own employees.''
   Dukakis referred to trade legislation passed by Congress this
week but which the White House says Reagan will veto because of an
amendment requiring notice before plants are closed. Republican
opponents say the measure does not belong in the trade bill and
would be undue government interference with business.
   ``These people are our neighbors,'' said Dukakis in prepared
remarks. ``They deserve better from their employers. They deserve
better from America.''
   Dukakis began campaigning in Ohio and Indiana where primaries
are scheduled next Tuesday.
   After taking a break back home in Boston following his huge
victory in Pennsylvania over his only remaining rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Jesse Jackson, Dukakis was
speaking to a meeting of Ohio labor leaders at the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 683 Hall in Columbus.
   He resumed attacks on corporate mergers and acquisitions which
he said provide profits for ``Wall Street pirates and corporate hit
teams'' while costing workers their jobs.
   Dukakis, who arrived in Columbus on Thursday night, had stops
today including a rally in Dayton and a visit to a high school in
Youngstown.
   Dukakis' backers here expressed confidence that momentum from
victories in New York and Pennsylvania will help him roll up a big
win in Ohio as well.
   State Sen. Harry Meshel of Youngstown, Dukakis' Ohio campaign
chairman, pointed to a statewide network of 170 public officials
supporting the Massachusetts governor. However, Gov. Richard
Celeste has not taken sides.
   Celeste was to appear with Dukakis but also planned to join
Jackson for a church service on Sunday in Cleveland. Jackson has
been in the state most of the week.
   Ohio has 159 delegates up for grabs Tuesday, with another 24 to
be added at the convention by various Democratic procedures.
   Before leaving for Ohio, the Massachusetts governor released
copies of letters sent to Reagan and congressional leaders urging
enactment of the trade bill.
   ``Mr. President, I believe that our record trade deficit
requires that we put partisan politics aside and take action that
will be in the best interest of all Americans,'' Dukakis said in
the letter. He said the bill ``will help return the United States
to a position in the world where we can once again compete
successfully with all of our trading partners.''
   At a news conference, Dukakis said he would make the trade bill
a major part of his attack on Bush if Reagan vetoes the measure.
   ``I think the issues of workers being laid off, what is
happening to the industrial base of this country, and the failure
of this administration to do much to deal with that and what a new
president would do to work hard with business and labor and
community leaders to restore our competitive edge and rebuild our
industrial base will be very much one of the major issues,'' he
told reporters.
   Dukakis has made the plant-closing issue a campaign theme in the
industrial states. He has called on Bush, the certain Republican
nominee, to publicly urge Reagan to sign the trade bill.

<HEAD>Documentary Contradicts Official Account On IRA Guerrillas</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with Thatcher, Howe comments.
Pick up 3rd graf pvs: `Gerry Adams...' TRIMS thereafter.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today denounced a
television documentary that contradicted the official version of
the killing of three unarmed IRA guerrillas by British commandos.
   ``The freedom of people depends on the rule of law, a fair legal
system,'' she told a Japanese television interviewer. ``The place
to have trials is a court of law. Trial by TV or guilt by
accusation is the day that freedom dies.''
   Television authorities rejected a government request to delay
the broadcast, and the hourlong documentary ``Death on the Rock''
aired Thursday night.
   The program said the guerrillas died while trying to flee or
surrender to the commandos in Gibraltar. Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe had said the guerrillas ``made movements which led
security personnel to believe their lives were in danger.''
   Thames Television said it received scores of calls after the
broadcast, running about 3-2 against the decision to screen the
film.
   Howe called the broadcast ``grossly and wholly improper'' and
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview that it had
``inevitably'' been shown on satellite TV in Gibraltar, where it
might influence an inquest jury.
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, legal political arm of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, said the allegations showed clearly
the guerrillas were ``summarily executed.''
   The Foreign Office said the Thames Television program featured
people due to testify at the inquest in Gibraltar and complained
that their accounts would influence the hearing. It had asked Lord
Thomson, chairman of the controlling Independent Broadcasting
Authority, to delay broadcasting the program.
   Thomson turned down the request, denied the documentary would
prejudice the inquest and said postponement would give the IRA more
``oxygen of publicity.''
   Thames TV said the documentary was the result of a seven-week
investigation which included interviews with 150 residents of
apartments overlooking the area where the guerrillas were shot
March 6.
   In the documentary, translator Carmen Proetta said she saw the
shootings from her apartment window in the British colony that
borders Spain.
   Mrs. Proetta said she saw three armed men in plainclothes get
out of a police car, jump over a metal barrier in the road and open
fire on two of the guerrillas, later identified as Mairead Farrell,
31, and Daniel McCann, 30.
   ``When they (Ms. Farrell and McCann) saw these men had guns in
their hands, they just put their hands up ... There was no chance.
I mean they went to the floor immediately, they dropped,'' Mrs.
Proetta said.
   She described the guerrillas' action in putting their hands up
as ``like giving themselves up.''
   Mrs. Proetta said that after the initial shooting, which she
said occurred without warning, ``a blond gunman bent down and with
the two hands he got his gun like that and went on shooting at
them.''
   Others described seeing the third guerrilla, Sean Savage, 24,
shot in the back as he tried to run away.
   Mrs. Proetta's account appeared to contradict Howe's March 7
statement to Parliament that the guerrillas were challenged as they
walked toward the nearby Spanish border and were slain because they
``made movements which led security personnel to believe their
lives were in danger.''
   The IRA said at the time that the guerrillas had been on
``active service,'' meaning they were planning an attack.
   The Gibraltar killings triggered a fresh outbreak of violence in
Northern Ireland in which nine people, including two British
soldiers, died.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the Republic of Ireland.

   A gynecologist was charged with
sexual battery after he allegedly handcuffed his wife and performed
an abortion on her, authorities said.
   The 52-year-old doctor, who operates a clinic where abortions
are performed, was arrested Wednesday. Prosecutors said he could
face more charges.
   ``If in fact this occurred, and this person is a physician, it's
beyond comprehension,'' Broward County Judge J. Bart Budetti said
Thursday in setting bond at $50,000. The doctor, who refused to
speak during the hearing, posted the bail.
   The 37-year-old woman was treated and released at Broward
General Medical Center, where a doctor confirmed that she'd had an
abortion, police said.
   The gynecologist allegedly handcuffed his wife Sunday as she was
lying in bed, took her into the bathroom and performed an abortion
on her 11-week-old fetus without anesthesia because she refused his
sexual advances, said police spokesman Ott Cefkin.
   The doctor told her as he performed the abortion that if she
didn't stay still, he would inject her with something to calm her
down, police said.

<TEXT>
   OPEC talks aimed at shoring up oil prices
bogged down early today in a technical debate that one cartel
leader called a ``waste of time.''
   A nearly four-hour meeting over a proposal to cut oil exports in
conjunction with independent producers broke up early today without
any agreements, and leaders of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said they would reconvene this evening.
   They said no agreements had been reached.
   Fernando Santos, the oil minister of Ecuador, told reporters
later that it was impossible to predict whether an accord could be
reached, since ``there's a wide divergence'' of views among the 13
OPEC members.
   The oil ministers are considering a proposal from six non-OPEC
oil producers to cut both groups' exports by 5 percent in an effort
to push OPEC oil prices back to $18 a barrel.
   The non-OPEC group says it will cut its exports only if OPEC
does likewise.
   But opinions differ sharply within the cartel over whether
further cutbacks are needed, and there are indications some members
_ including influential Saudi Arabia _ favor enforcement of
existing output quotas over new cuts.
   World oil prices continued sliding early today as the OPEC
leaders struggled to resolve their differences.
   On the European market, Brent crude oil from the North Sea was
down 35 cents a barrel, at $16.80, at mid-afternoon after having
lost 30 cents on Thursday. The U.S. oil markets hadn't yet opened.
   Traders said the declines reflected doubts that the oil
ministers' meeting would produce a concrete agreement on measures
designed to boost the oil market.
   Prices have fallen this year because supplies have risen faster
than demand.
   Most OPEC crudes are selling for $16 a barrel or less, although
oil traded in the West usually sells for more.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June contracts for West
Texas Intermediate, the most widely traded U.S. crude, fell 29
cents to $17.98 dollars a barrel on Thursday after dropping 33
cents the day before. Prices on European markets fell about 30
cents a barrel on Thursday.
   Some industry analysts believe prices would rebound if OPEC
accepted the non-OPEC offer. But others doubt that OPEC could agree
on reductions large enough to make a difference in the global
balance of supply and demand.
   OPEC's opening debate focused more on differing views of the oil
market's supply and demand balance than on the merits of the
non-OPEC group's proposal, according to sources who spoke on
condition they not be identified by name or nationality.
   In an apparent effort to bridge the gap in these views, the oil
ministers instructed a team of experts from each member country to
meet today to assess the present and near-term market balance.
   Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister, told
reporters he was unhappy that time was being devoted to a meeting
of experts, which he said only would highlight the differing views
between OPEC countries.
   ``This is, in some sense, a waste of time,'' he said.
   Hernandez said one suggestion under consideration was to forego
the proposed export cuts in favor of recommitting the 13 members to
existing oil production quotas, which often are violated.
   ``We know that several countries have been overproducing for
years,'' he said, without naming the countries.
   ``...If we can have a full guarantee that these countries are
going to abide by their quotas, that would improve the market
situation. But I have a lot of doubt about that,'' he said.
   Iran was alone among the OPEC members in stating its clear
support for the non-OPEC offer. None have rejected it outright.
   Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, declined to say
whether his country favored the non-OPEC proposal, made Wednesday
by Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Angola and Malaysia.
   But Saudi King Fahd on Thursday bolstered the impression of many
industry analysts that he would not accept any cuts in OPEC
production or exports. He said the cartel's main goal should be to
stick to its existing production limits.
   ``I believe prices will go up if we adhere to the output ceiling
and convince non-OPEC producers of the feasibility of limiting
their production,'' he said in an interview published by a Kuwaiti
newspaper.
   Bryan Jacoboski, who was observing the OPEC meeting for the
investment firm PaineWebber Inc., said Fahd's statement was ``the
real nail in the coffin'' of expectations that the cartel would
accept the non-OPEC proposal.

<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers at the racketeering trial of
Rep. Mario Biaggi are continuing their campaign to put the Reagan
administration on trial for the Wedtech Corp. scandal.
   On Thursday, they got a prosecution witness to admit under
cross-examination that Wedtech hired a distant relative of Vice
President George Bush partly ``because of his contact with the vice
president.''
   But the witness, Wedtech former chief financial officer Lawrence
Shorten, denied that Charles Dickey Dyer III, related to Bush by
marriage, was hired as a management consultant to win Bush's
support for Wedtech's bid to obtain a multimillion-dollar Navy
contract.
   Shorten said Dyer was hired before he joined Wedtech and Shorten
did not think Dyer was still working for the Bronx defense
contractor in 1984 when a Navy pontoon contract was up.
   Steve Hart, a Bush spokesman, confirmed that Dyer is related to
Bush through marriage, but said the vice president had nothing to
do with contracts. Dyer's younger sister, Margie, is married to
Bush's wife's older brother, James Pierce.
   In a telephone interview, Dyer said he stopped working for
Wedtech in the fall of 1981 although payment for his consulting
services was strung out until early 1984.
   Dyer, reached at his Princeton, N.J., home, also denied speaking
or writing to Bush about Wedtech's attempt to get a Navy pontoon
contract.
   ``If they (Wedtech officials) had any influence with George
Bush, I didn't get it for them,'' he said.
   However, Dyer said he did write the vice president at least
twice on the company's behalf about an Army engine contract in 1981.
   Hart said Bush received five or six letters from Dyer.
   ``We have looked into this before and I have seen the letters,''
he said. ``The vice president either didn't respond to the letters
or in the cases where he did respond, they were very cursory
responses.
   ``We have no records of any type of involvement or any action
involving Navy contracts that would suggest the vice president took
any position one way or another.''
   He said that Bush, as chairman of the president's regulatory
relief task force, often gets letters from small businesses.
   In the courtroom, Shorten also said he was told by a close
friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese III that he would have
President Reagan overrule the Navy if they did not give the
contract to Wedtech.
   The witness is one of four former top Wedtech executives who
have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges. All four are now
cooperating with the government in exchange for leniency.
   Biaggi and six others are accused of turning Wedtech, now
bankrupt, into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of
dollars in bribes to obtain no-bid government contracts through a
program for minority-controlled businesses.
   Defense lawyers have tried to show that Wedtech officials had
close links to high-ranking officials in the Reagan White House and
did not need the help of a Democratic congressman from the Bronx.

   By her daughter's account, Stella Nickell put
cyanide in pain relief capsules to poison her husband of 12 years
for as much as $176,000 in life insurance benefits.
   Mrs. Nickell, however, says she loved Bruce Nickell more than
money, and her defense lawyer notes that her daughter, Cindy
Hamilton, 28, came forward after pharmaceutical companies offered a
$300,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever
was responsible for the tampering.
   A U.S. District Court jury will likely begin deciding between
those two accounts Monday in the nation's first
death-by-product-tampering trial.
   Testimony before the 12-member panel and Judge William Dwyer
ended Thursday after a government witness supported part of Ms.
Hamilton's version.
   Closing arguments were set for Monday, followed by instructions
to the jury and the start of deliberations.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, is charged with five counts of tampering with
over-the-counter medicine, including two involving the death of her
52-year-old husband and Sue Katherine Snow, 40, in June 1986. Both
died after swallowing cyanide-laced capsules of Extra-Strength
Excedrin.
   Government lawyers claim she tampered with other pain-relief
capsules and put them on store shelves to cover up the killing of
her husband.
   The last witness, Katherine Parker, said she was rooming with
Ms. Hamilton in November 1985 when Ms. Hamilton reported what she
thought were her mother's plans.
   ``Cindy came home and said `Katy, do you know what my mother
just said to me? She asked me how much cocaine it would take to
kill a person,''' Ms. Parker testified. ``She said that her mother
had been talking about getting rid of her (step)father ... she was
getting tired of him.''
   Ms. Hamilton had testified Tuesday that her mother discussed
putting cocaine in Nickell's iced tea to make his death look like
an overdose.
   In cross-examination earlier Thursday, assistant U.S. attorney
Joanne Maida noted that shortly before Nickell's death, Mrs.
Nickell had twice written a bank to which they owed money to say
she was taking over the finances and that the couple's ``marriage
problems'' would soon be resolved.
   Mrs. Nickell responded that she loved her husband and did not
try to hide insurance policies, all signed by her, from FBI
investigators.
   She confirmed that she and her husband owed three banks and an
investment company $8,553 at the time, plus a lot more to clear
titles on their land and mobile home, but she denied that their
financial situation was getting worse and noted that both were
employed.
   Her lawyer, Tom Hillier, asked if she were responsible for the
crimes.
   ``No,'' she replied. ``The thought never entered my mind and
never would because I loved Bruce too much. There's no way I'd ever
think of getting rid of him.''
   The prosecution also introduced evidence showing that Mrs.
Nickell had checked out library books on poisonous plants in 1983
and 1984. She said she had borrowed the books to make sure that
plants on her rural property weren't harmful to her grandchildren.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Dissolves Cabinet, Calls New Elections</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Prem dissolving Cabinet and
Parliament and calling new elections.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda
dissolved his Cabinet and the Parliament today and called new
elections in a dispute over legislation to protect U.S. copyrights.
   The official Radio Thailand said general elections would be held
July 24.
   Earlier today, 16 Cabinet ministers belonging to the main party
in Prem's coalition government submitted their resignations after
failing to stop party dissidents from voting against the
government-backed bill to protect American copyrights.
   The Democrat Party ministers _ representing about a third of the
Cabinet _ resigned because ``they could not control'' the party
dissidents, said Col. Sanan Kachornprasat, the party's secretary
general.
   The radio announcement said Prem and would continue at his post
until the election.
   Prem, Thailand's longest-serving prime minster, has headed five
Cabinets since assuming his post in 1980. The last general election
was held in 1986.
   The dissolution of Parliament forestalled a probable opposition
motion to censure the government over its handling of various
issues, including economic problems and recent border clashes with
Laos. The censure motion had been expected May 9.
   The House of Representatives passed the copyright bill 183-134
on Thursday, but 32 legislators in the dissident group joined
members of opposition parties in voting against it.
   The dissidents said the legislation, which protects U.S.
copyrights of artistic and literary works, would force Thailand to
bow to U.S. bullying. The United States had indicated that it might
be forced to cut duty privileges for Thai imports if the measure
wasn't passed.
   Music and videocassettes and other U.S. products are widely
pirated in Thailand. The legislation is expected to be approved by
the government-appointed Senate.
   The U.S. Embassy today welcomed passage of the copyright bill,
although it didn't meet an American demand that it specifically
protect computer software. The legislation left that question to
the Thai courts.
   ``We are prepared to await the determination of the Thai courts
as to whether or not software is covered under the existing Thai
copyright law,'' said Embassy spokesman Ross Petzing. ``We believe
computer software should receive copyright protection.''
   The 67-year-old prime minister has been criticized for
indecision on a number of issues, but others have noted his
contribution to Thailand's general stability and economic progress
in recent years.
   The former military commander was preceded by a procession of
military-led coups and major government changes. Prem survived two
major coup attempts by dissident military officers in 1981 and 1985.
   But he has maneuvered quietly and deftly to undercut potential
opposition from the military and is widely believed to enjoy the
backing of King Bhumibol, the country's highly respected and
powerful monarch.

Lehder Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys, after listening to
22 weeks of government testimony and 115 witnesses, will begin
presenting their case Monday in the cocaine-smuggling trial of
Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   Edward R. Shohat, one of Lehder's two attorneys, said earlier
this week that the defense case may only take two weeks, but
estimates in this marathon trial have been notoriously conservative.
   When the jury selection started in October, attorneys said they
expected the trial to last from six weeks to three months. But,
counting jury selection and a two-week Christmas recess, the trial
has ended its 30th week.
   Lehder, 38, accused of being one of the leaders of Colombia's
violent Medellin cocaine cartel, and Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are
being tried on charges of conspiring to smuggle some 3.3 tons of
cocaine into the United States through Lehder's private island in
the Bahamas, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.
   The prosecution wrapped up its case shortly after noon Thursday
following the presentation of interviews Lehder gave earlier this
decade on Colombian radio and television.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle had argued that the presentation
of the tapes was essential to his case, although U.S. District
Judge Howell W. Melton ordered references to Adolf Hitler and the
slaying of Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla edited
from the tapes.
   The judge denied motions from defense attorneys for directed
judgments of acquittal to the charges contained in the 11-count
federal indictment.
   In the tapes, the jury heard Lehder deny several times that he
was a drug smuggler.
   ``I have never admitted that I have dealt or done any business
with drugs,'' Lehder said in a jungle interview in 1985.
   In the same interview, however, he said, ``This is about
political action, and cocaine has become _ and marijuana has become
_ a revolutionary weapon in the struggle against North American
imperialism.
   ``Stimulants from Colombia are the Achilles' heel of
imperialism. That's why the persecution against us is not legal, it
is political. But I have never been arrested in possession of any
drug whatsoever.''
   The Colombian also made anti-American statements, calling the
United States ``a country guided by Playboy magazine ... guided by
a society, let us say, drunken on pornography.''
   He also opposed the extradition treaty that eventually resulted
in his arrest on the charges for which he is being tried.
   ``So then they say I conspired against the United States. I say
that not only did I conspire but that I conspire now and that I
shall continue to conspire until the day the .... extradition
treaty is canceled.''
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged only with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy.

<TEXT>
   The government said today it didn't know
the leader of an Armenian terrorist group who was assassinated
outside his Athens home had lived in Greece for the past year.
   Agop Agopian was gunned down before dawn Thursday as he waited
for a taxi in front of his suburban apartment. Police sources said
Agopian lived in Greece for at least a year, posing as a Lebanese
businessmen. He was founder and chief of the Armenian Secret Army
for the Liberation of Armenia.
   ``Authorities in Greece didn't know his identity,'' government
spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said.
   Agopian also carried a South Yemen diplomatic passport in the
name of Abdul Mohammed Kasim.
   Kostopoulos said Agopian, who was not registered as a diplomat
here, had not been working in Greece.
   Agopian and a woman identified as his sister-in-law were
standing in front of Agopian's home when two masked men emerged
from a car.
   One man shot Agopian twice with a sawed-off shotgun and fired
again when the victim tried to run. The assailants fled. The woman
was unhurt.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing.
   The assassination could have been the work of a rival extremist
group, said Armenian sources in Athens who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Police at first identified the victim as 39-year-old Abdul
Mohammed Kashim, born in Aden, based on the South Yemeni diplomatic
passport he carried.
   ``He'd lived in Athens for at least a year _ possibly longer _
as Henri Titizian, but he traveled abroad very frequently on the
Yemeni passport,'' said a police source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But after reports from Paris said the dead man was the
long-sought leader of the terrorist group, his wife, Janil
Titizian, confirmed he was Agop Agopian, the Ministry of Public
Order said in a statement.
   Police said Ms. Titizian told them her husband recently arrived
from South Yemen and was on his way to Yugoslavia.
   The group, founded by Agopian in 1975, has claimed more than 60
attacks against Turkish targets, including the killings of about 30
Turkish diplomats and dependents in western Europe and the United
States.
   The Marxist organization seeks the foundation of an independent
Armenian state in eastern Turkey and vengeance for what they claim
was the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in
1915-1916.
   The Armenian sources said Agopian was born in Iraq in 1945, and
that his name was most likely a pseudonym.
   He ran the group from Beirut with funding from the Palestine
Liberation Organization and leftist groups but dropped out of sight
in July 1982.
   His group claimed responsibility for the July 1983 bombing of
the Turkish Airlines desk at Orly Airport in Paris that killed
eight people and injured 56.
   Agopian's former second-in-command, Monte Melkonian, formed a
splinter group called ASALA-Revolutionary Movement after the Orly
bombing, complaining that ASALA had abandoned its original policy
of focusing only on Turkish targets.
   ASALA has claimed only one attack in Athens, the killing of
Turkish diplomat Galip Ozman and his daughter in August 1980. The
group's political wing, the Armenian Popular Movement, has operated
an office in the Greek capital for several years.
   Turkish officials say 300,000 Armenians died after Ottoman
Empire officials deported the country's 1.4 million Armenians to
Syria during World War I. Independent historians say at least
600,000 Armenians died during the journey.

   Two prominent South Korean dissidents

   Dissident Kim Keun-Tae and his wife, In Jae-keun, will each

   Kim has been in prison since his arrest in 1985, and In now

   The dissident couple was to have received the 1987 Kennedy
awards in Washington. But the South Korean government refused to
allow the two to visit the United States, human rights group
members said in a statement.
   The U.S. delegation will include two daughters of slain Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, Rose Styron of Amnesty International and Patt
Derian, former Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, the
statement said.
   The group plans to meet with South Korean government officials,
human rights activists, Cardinal Stephen Kim and opposition leaders
Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam.

<HEAD>Health Group Plans To Push For Stronger Restrictions On Accutane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group affiliated with Ralph Nader plans to
push the Food and Drug Administration to more severely restrict a
powerful anti-acne drug that causes birth defects, a doctor
representing the organization said today.
   ``We have an FDA with strong laws but weak enforcement,'' said
Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the Health Research Group of Public Citizen, an
organization that has long been critical of the FDA.
   ``American families are too important to be left to a Reagan
administration that seems to give deference to the drug industry,''
Wolfe said in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today.''
   An FDA advisory panel recommended earlier this week that the
drug Accutane remain on the market because it is the only effective
cure for severe acne. But it urged that additional warnings be
added to new packaging to further discourage use by pregnant women
and that the FDA find a way to legally restrict the drug's
distribution.
   The FDA is not bound by the advisory panel's recommendations.
   Wolfe said Public Citizen would file a petition with the FDA to
implement strong restrictions and is considering filing a lawsuit.
He recommended that dermatologists who prescribe the drug be
required to sign a sworn statement that they will not misuse it.
   Accutane's manufacturer, LaRoche Laboratories of New Jersey, had
proposed new packaging that would more effectively warn against its
use by pregnant women.
   The manufacture acknowledges 62 U.S. cases of birth defects
caused by Accutane since the drug was introduced in 1982. Wolfe
said there could be several hundreds more and thousands of
abortions induced because of fear of the drug's side effects. A
confidential FDA memorandum reported last week by The New York
Times estimated that between 900 and 1,300 cases of birth defects
were caused by Accutane between 1982 and 1986.
   ``The company has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
this drug and the FDA seems resistant to doing something that would
significantly reduce the sales,'' Wolfe said.
   ``It's a very important drug,'' he said, ``and the question is
why can't it be limited carefully to the smaller number of people
who really need it without giving it to a larger number of people
and allowing pregnant women to get the drug?''

<HEAD>Secret Service Agents Visit Dukakis Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Gov. Michael Dukakis may
soon get the Secret Service protection he has up to now rejected.
   On Thursday, the Boston Globe quoted an unnamed source and a
campaign aide confirmed that Secret Service agents recentl have
visited the Brookline home of the Massachusetts governor as
preparation for providing protection.
   The aide said the decision on whether to accept Secret Service
protection is still officially ``under review.''
   Dukakis has said Secret Service agents would make it difficult
for him to have personal contact with voters and he objected to the
intrusiveness of protection at home.
   The governor, who regularly travels by public transportation, is
protected by Capitol Police at the statehouse in Boston and was
protected by local police, including plainclothed officers, in New
York and Pennsylvania during those states' recent primaries.
   Presidential candidates, under federal law, do not have to
accept Secret Service protection.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are just as concerned about drug
trafficking and foreign economic power as they are about
U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons according to a recent survey.
   Given a choice of seven national security goals, 22 percent of
those surveyed picked combatting international drug traffic as the
No. 1 priority. Another 18 percent said correcting America's
growing trade imbalance was the most important goal. Reducing U.S.
and Soviet long range missiles was chosen by 15 percent of those
surveyed.
   The poll said 59 percent of the American people believe economic
competitors like Japan pose more of a threat to national security
than traditional military adversaries like the Soviets.
   The survey, issued Thursday, was conducted by a group that
includes pollsters for presidential candidates Michael Dukakis and
George Bush.
   Tom Kiley, who polls for Dukakis, said the Democrats are pleased
that the survey shows a ``broadening prism'' through which
Americans look at security issues.
   Fred Steeper, whose Market Opinion Research company works for
Bush, said it ``is a blow against a protectionist stance,'' that 61
percent of Americans chose ``improved efficiency'' as the key to
reducing the trade deficit compared to 24 percent who chose
``fairer trade practices.''
   It was the fourth poll in a 10-series survey called ``Americans
Talk Security.'' The polls are a collaborative effort by four
organizations, including Martilla & Kiley, of Boston, and Market
Opinion Research of Detroit. They are funded by Boston millionaire
Alan F. Kay, president of the Institute for Defense and Disarmament
Studies, a pro-nuclear freeze group.

<HEAD>Robertson Campaign Given Two Weeks to Give IRS Financial Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson's presidential campaign has
until May 12 to submit financial records in a federal investigation
of the tax-exempt status of the former television evangelist's
broadcasting network.
   U.S. Magistrate Rebecca B. Smith on Thursday extended a
show-cause order for two weeks for documents originally requested
by the Internal Revenue last December.
   Robert L. O'Donnell, attorney for Americans for Robertson, said
the records would be available within five days.
   ``We have not opposed any of the requests and have made records
available as quickly as possible,'' he said in asking for a
continuance of an order filed late last month.
   In addition to financial data, the IRS asked for copies of
fund-raising letters and ``records of any transactions with the
Freedom Council or Christian Broadcasting Network.''
   CBN was founded by Robertson who was its president until last
October, when he announced his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination.
   The Freedom Council was established in 1981 with seed money from
CBN, and sought tax exempt status from the IRS saying it was
created to educate Christians on how to get involved in politics.
   The organization received nearly $3 million from the network in
1985, according to former council officials and critics contend the
council, which disbanded in 1986 shortly after Americans for
Robertson was formed, acted as a front for the Robertson campaign.

   Workers today struck a heavy machinery
plant in southeastern Poland in an escalation of the nation's worst
labor unrest in six years, opposition leaders said.
   The government denied a strike had begun at the Stalowa Wola
plant and threatened to fire anyone who did strike.
   Thousands of steelworkers at the giant Lenin mills outside
Krakow continued their strike for a fourth day demanding higher pay
and union rights.
   Opposition spokesman Jacek Kuron in Warsaw said 21 Solidarity
activists were detained across the country today, an indication
communist authorities' tolerance for worker defiance was waning.
   ``The situation in Poland is not dramatic,'' government
spokesman Jerzy Urban said at a hastily called news conference. He
said ``an attempt to organize a strike'' failed at Stalowa Wola.
   Urban said plant management would fire any workers who took part
in a strike.
   Contacted by telex, the plant was repeating a recorded message
that work was ``going on normally'' and that a rally by workers had
ended.
   Labor Minister Ireneneusz Sekula said at the news conference
with Urban that the government would announce in a few days tax law
changes and other measures to allow enterprises to meet growing
worker pressure for higher pay. Consumer prices have gone up by 42
percent so far this year.
   Urban also said there had been an unspecified number of
``preventative detentions.'' He did not elaborate.
   The strike at the 18,000-worker machinery plant in Stalowa Wola
began with the first shift this morning, according to opposition
activists and the Rev. Edward Frankowski, a priest in the town 150
miles southeast of Warsaw.
   The priest said workers rallied outside plant headquarters.
   The police presence was heavy in Stalowa Wola and at least four
local Solidarity activists were detained, according to Frankowski
and Solidarity spokesman Zbigniew Romaszewski, who was in Warsaw.
   Strikers were demanding $50 monthly pay raises and the
reinstatement of dismissed Solidarity activists.
   Thousands of workers continued their occupation of the Lenin
steel mill, outside the southern city of Krakow.
   The strikers began their action Tuesday, demanding higher wages,
recognition of union rights and more money for retirees, teachers,
and industrial and health care workers nationwide.
   Strike committee member Maciej Mach said today that about 13,000
strikers were inside the steelworks, around which the Krakow suburb
of Nowa Huta was built in the 1950s. He said his committee had not
negotiated with management since talks broke off early Thursday.
   The steelworkers were warned Thursday that their strike was
illegal. Their leaders said management had threatened to use force
to end it.
   The head of the government-sanctioned union at the 32,000-worker
plant, Wladyslaw Sitkowski, said he planned to resume today talks
with management that began Thursday. Mach said the strike committee
rejected the official union taking any role in the dispute.
   Organizers said at least 16,000 people had stopped work at the
plant in Nowa Huta, or New Steel Mill, staying on premises for two
shifts and going home to rest for one.
   The government was clearly concerned the labor unrest might
spread. Sunday is May Day, international Labor Day and a
traditional time of anti-government protest in Poland.
   Alfred Miodowicz, a member of the ruling Communist Party
Politburo, was dispatched Thursday to the Lenin mill. He is
national head of the officially sanctioned trade unions.
   Deputy Prime Minister Zdzislaw Sadowski, who the official new
agency PAP said would appear on television to discuss the economy,
postponed a visit today to Washington to meet with International
Monetary Fund officials.
   Sadowski is chief architect of the government's effort to make
the economy more market-oriented through reforms that have included
the price increases.
   The unofficial strike committee at Nowa Huta, whose 16 members
include Solidarity activists, have demanded a 50 percent increase
of the average monthly pay of $105.
   It also said the $15 paid monthly in compensation nationwide for
recent price increases should be doubled for industrial workers,
teachers, health care workers and retirees.
   This week's labor unrest is the most serious in Poland since
strikes in 1980 over food price increases that spawned Solidarity
and brought down a government. The unrest ended with the December
1981 imposition of martial law.
   On Monday, transit workers in the northwestern city of Bydgoszcz
staged an 11-hour strike and won a 60 percent raise. A day later,
the strike began at the Lenin works.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Dukakis Wants To ``Manage Reaganomics''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recast lede; SUB 6th graf bgng ``The AP'' to update Dukakis
delegate total</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says he won't give up his
Democratic presidential bid despite a string of losses but he says
his role now is ``to raise distinctions'' between his positions and
those of Democratic rival Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush.
   Jackson on Thursday underscored what he considers Dukakis'
weaknesses _ domestic economic proposals and the situation in
southern Africa _ and he said that his own platform offers voters a
clear alternative to the front-runner. In contrast to the
conciliatory tone he has struck throughout the primary campaign,
Jackson appears to be taking off the gloves a bit with Dukakis.
   In speeches Thursday he also criticized the Massachusetts
governor for not having a plan to pay for his proposal to provide
higher education for every young person.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Jackson said he wants
to keep his campaign issues on his party's political agenda even if
he does not become the Democratic nominee. But he said he is not
conceding the nomination to Dukakis as the governor is pulling away
from him in the delegate count.
   ``My role now is to raise distinctions and give people a
choice,'' he said.
   The AP delegate count shows Dukakis has amassed 1,276 delegates
to Jackson's 852, with 2,081 needed to win the nomination this
summer.
   ``I've got my second wind,'' Jackson told a gymnasium full of
fans at the University of Toledo. ``I`ve just begun to fight.''
   As for comments attributed to his campaign manager, Gerald
Austin, implying that the campaign was now focused less on winning
than on contributing to the party, Jackson told the AP: ``Our
campaign is a campaign of commitment and content. There is no
conflict between campaigning to win and having issues of content to
make a difference.
   ``We are trying to win. When you're behind you run a little
faster.''
   Jackson's message on Thursday was that Bush as a member of
President Reagan's team wants to continue Reaganomics, while
``Dukakis wants to manage Reaganomics. I want to reverse
Reaganomics.''
   He said Dukakis is ``to the right of Reagan'' on South Africa
because Reagan is willing to provide weaponry to Mozambique against
alleged South African-backed rebels, while Dukakis would not do so.
   Jackson also lobbed criticism at Democratic party chief Paul
Kirk, saying in the interview that Kirk should have stepped in when
New York Mayor Ed Koch was savaging Jackson as an anti-Israel
candidate.
   Jackson also indicated unhappiness with the party's oversight of
delegate selection in some states and in Puerto Rico. He would not
say whether he would challenge any delegate apportionment, but said
those matters are left to Austin and campaign chairman Willie Brown.
   Reflecting on the months of campaigning, Jackson said he feels
he has injected issues that became part of the political dialogue.
   ``Our message has been adopted and absorbed,'' he said. ``So now
Dukakis is going to schools to speak to students about drugs. He's
talking about reinvesting in America.''
   At stake in Tuesday's Ohio primary are 159 Democratic delegates.
A Gallup poll this month showed Dukakis with a 2-to-1 lead among
Democratic voters.

   The number of infant deaths in the United States
has decreased, according to a report by the federal health
officials.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
for every 1,000 live births in the United States in 1984-85,
premature deaths robbed those infants under age 1 of 694 years of
life they would have had if they had lived to be age 65.
   That was down 7 percent from the average of 749 years for
1980-83.
   The CDC measures ``years of potential life lost'' _ by people
dying before 65 _ as a way to gauge the killers of younger people.
Sixty-five is used as a statistical benchmark; most Americans' life
expectancy is higher.
   Since the number of infant deaths depends in part on the number
of infant births, CDC looked at the ``years of potential life
lost'' averages to gauge trends in infant mortality.
   Deaths of infants between birth and age 1 take the greatest
amount of ``potential life'' of all; in 1985, the United States
recorded 40,000 such deaths.
   The CDC found that between 1980-83 and the period 1984-85, the
``years of potential life lost'' due to prematurity and low
birthweight, respiratory distress, birth trauma and other factors
went down for both black and white infants.
   The Atlanta-based CDC, in its weekly report, particularly noted
a sharp drop in potential life lost to birth trauma and asphyxia _
down 33 percent for whites and 31 percent for blacks.
   ``It makes us curious to look at why,'' Ms. Rowley said.
   The CDC said that ``the marked decline ... due to birth trauma
(or) asphyxia'' suggests either better care for newborns at birth,
better neonatal care for babies suffering from birth trauma or
asphyxia, or both.
   The CDC also found that non-white infants die prematurely more
often than whites, although death rates for both groups are
declining.
   ``Although there were fewer years of potential life lost for
(both) whites and blacks, there's still a big gap between those two
groups,'' said Dr. Dianne Rowley of the CDC.
   In recent years, she noted, ``there have been programs and
strategies initiated to try and diminish the excess numbers of
deaths among blacks and other minorities. It will be a while before
we can evaluate those efforts.''

<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man claiming to be the father of an
18-month-old boy found wandering in traffic a month ago has
contacted authorities.
   The man, Theodore Kenneth Shirley of Zephyrhills, northeast of
Tampa, said he last had contact with the toddler last fall in
central Florida, Lakeland Police Detective Miles Watson said
Thursday.
   ``He said he was the child's father. And he provided information
that leads us to believe he could be,'' Watson said. If the
identity checks out, the reason for the separation probably will be
revealed as being domestic-related, the detective said.
   ``Apparently he heard about the case on the news. It triggered
his interest. And more things began to fit,'' said Watson.
   ``Little Kenny'' has been in protective custody since March 25
when he was rescued from traffic. Since photos of the child were
published last week, more than a dozen people have offered to adopt
him.
   The day after the boy was taken into custody, a man claiming to
be the toddler's uncle reported his 18-month-old nephew missing
from the same area.
   The man, Michael ``Smokey'' Kwil, told Lakeland police he first
saw the boy on March 23 in a bar. The child was with Kwil's
half-brother, Kwil told police. During the night the half-brother
borrowed a motorcycle and left for Washington state, Kwil said.
   Watson said although Kwil has told conflicting stories as to
what happened to the boy, it appeared the child wandered away from
Kwil's trailer not far from where he was found in traffic.
   Shirley, who met with police and with child-care officials of
the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilatative Services, told
authorities he had not known the whereabouts of his son.
   Health service officials had listed the toddler with ``Child
Find'' in Tallahassee and the national registry for missing
children.

   Hundreds of Palestinians demonstrated on the
Moslem Sabbath today. Sources said Israeli troops were scouring
south Lebanon in a crackdown on Arab guerrillas who sneak across
the border into Israel.
   Israel radio reported that a small Israeli army force entered
the Lebanese villages of Kfar Hamam and Rachaiya el Foukhar, both
about five miles north of the Israeli border, and questioned
several dozen residents.
   Security sources in Lebanon confirmed that Israeli troops and
their Lebanese allies were carrying out searches but said most were
not in villages but in the rocky terrain in south Lebanon's eastern
sector.
   The sources, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, said five Lebanese villagers had been detained.
   An army spokesman said two militiamen from the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army were killed today when their vehicle ran over a
land mine on a side road in Israel's self-declared security zone
north of the border.
   The interrogations came after two guerrilla infiltrations within
two days this week in which two Israeli soldiers and five
Palestinian guerrillas were killed.
   In Jerusalem, several hundred Arabs demonstrated outside the Al
Aqsa mosque after the noon Moslem prayers, chanting ``Palestine is
Arab'' and ``Jews leave because the Prophet Mohammed's army is
returning.''
   The demonstrators dispersed without confronting police, who were
stationed nearby.
   Some of the protesters waved outlawed Palestinian flags and
shouted slogans about PLO military leader Khalil Wazir, who was
assassinated April 16. Israeli sources have said Israeli commandos
killed him, but the government has not confirmed it.
   In the surrounding streets of Old Jerusalem, Palestinian
shopkeepers began opening their stores promptly at 2 p.m., the hour
that leaders of the five-week-old uprising have dictated for shops
to open during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
   Israeli police have tried to force Arab merchants to open all
day, or not at all, in a move to break the hold of uprising leaders
on the shopkeepers.
   Underground leaders of the five-month Palestinian uprising in
the occupied lands had called for marches and symbolic funerals
today, the Moslem Sabbath, to honor Arabs killed in anti-Israeli
protests.
   But the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip appeared quiet today.
   In a new step aimed at curbing Arab demonstrations, the army
announced Thursday that parents in the occupied lands would be held
liable for offenses of children under the age of 12.
   Despite claims by Israeli leaders that the Arab rebellion was
waning, the death toll rose again Thursday with the killing of a
protester in Malek, a village near the West Bank city of Ramallah.
   Soon after entering the village to search for rioters, troops
were surrounded by hundreds of young Arabs who hurled stones and
then a firebomb, the army spokesman said. The troops fired in the
direction of the firebomb thrower, killing a Palestinian, he said.
   It was not immediately clear if the slain youth threw the
firebomb.
   The killing raised the Arab death toll to 175 since the violence
began in the territories last Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and
Israeli teen-ager have also died.
   A general strike Thursday in the occupied lands, called for by
the PLO, seemed to be as widely observed as any such strike since
the uprising began. Arab reporters noted that in many areas even
bakeries and street vendors, who normally stay open during strikes,
were shut.
   Arab protesters blocked roads in several cities in Gaza and the
West Bank, and taxi and bus stands in Arab east Jerusalem were
empty.

   House Speaker Jim Wright said today he doesn't
like the idea of taking Coast Guard patrol boats off anti-drug
patrols and moving them to the Persian Gulf.
   ``I think the average American citizen feels more threatened by
drugs'' than by events in the gulf, the Texas Democrat told
reporters. ``I don't think it's a good idea to rob the Coast Guard
of its principal missions here, one of them being anti-drug
efforts.''
   Wright's comments came a day after the chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee predicted that the House will
overwhelmingly vote to block tentative plans to send Coast Guard
patrol boats to the gulf.
   ``It's not going to even be close'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
referring to a proposal introduced to stop the plan now being
considered by the Pentagon.
   The ban will be voted upon by the House next week as the chamber
continues consideration of the Pentagon budget bill.
   Even though the bill won't become law for several months because
the Senate hasn't yet considered its version of the same measure, a
strong House vote against the plan will likely kill it, Aspin said
Thursday.
   ``As a practical political matter, the administration would not
be wise to do something that a large majority of Congress is
against, and this amendment will win easily,'' Aspin explained.
   The tentative plan calls for taking six of the Coast Guard's
110-foot Island-class patrol boats off anti-drug duty and sending
them to the Persian Gulf. Built for shallow waters, the boats would
help the Navy patrol the war-torn area.
   The Navy is escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers, raising
fears in Congress that the United States will be drawn into the
Iran-Iraq war because of Kuwait's ties with Iraq. There have been
several U.S.-Iran naval clashes, most recently April 18 when Navy
ships and planes sank or damaged six Iranian vessels.
   Adm. Paul A. Yost, Coast Guard commandant, told a Senate
subcommittee Thursday that he ``would be delighted'' to send the
ships to the gulf if ordered to do so.
   Yost said the move would have only ``a minimal impact'' on
anti-drug efforts because new Island-class builts are being built
and other ships could be pulled into the anti-drug effort off the
Florida coasts and in the Caribbean.
   But the plan has run into heavy fire on Capitol Hill.
   Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., a co-sponsor of the measure to which
Aspin referred, said, ``the Reagan administration should use the
Coast Guard's scarce resources to fight the war on drugs, not the
Iran-Iraq war.''
   The Coast Coast is strapped for money, and has responded to a
$100 million shortfall in its current budget by closing more than
30 shore installations and cutting anti-drug patrols by 55 percent.
   But the Navy has offered to pay any costs of sending the Coast
Guard vessels to the gulf, said Yost. Though part of the
Transportation Department, the Coast Guard also has national
security responsibilities and Coast Guard ships often operate with
Navy vessels.
   Yost appeared before the Senate Appropriations transportation
subcommittee, where he defended the plan. But when questioned
earlier about anti-drug efforts, he admitted, ``You can always use
more'' money and boats.
   ``It seems to me we're going to hurt our drug efforts'' by
sending the boats to the gulf, said Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., was even more critical. ``I think
it's an incredible policy,'' he told Yost. ``We kind of bumbled our
way into this.''
   But Yost said: ``This is not an idea off the top of somebody's
head. It was well thought out and researched.''
   Lowry disagreed. ``Sending the Coast Guard to the gulf would be
just another tragic, dangerous and poorly conceived move by the
administration,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A team of American and Soviet scientists
headed into the Nevada desert today to begin a series of
experiments they hope will prove that a cheat-proof ban on all
testing is possible.
   The experiments today and Saturday come on the heels of the
House's passage of a bill Thursday forbidding all but the smallest
nuclear tests, if the Soviet Union agreed to do the same.
   Scores of seismic monitors have been set up to record three
non-nuclear explosions in remote areas of the state to try to
demonstrate that if a U.S.-Soviet test ban treaty is signed, any
infraction could be detected.
   If the experiments are successful, they would show that ``any
chance for cheating are about excluded'' under a test ban, Evgeni
Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said
Thursday.
   Velikhov, an adviser to Mikhail Gorbachev, said, ``We think the
comprehensive test ban is very important. It is extremely important
to stop the arms race.''
   The experiment is part of an agreement between the Soviet
Academy of Sciences and the privately-funded Natural Resources
Defense Council of the United States.
   The Nevada tests will set off 10 tons of TNT in the Black Rock
Desert 15 miles northeast of here and 100 miles north of Reno today
and another 10-ton blast tonight in Lathrop Wells, 50 miles south
of the Nevada Test Site. A 15-ton charge was to be detonated
Saturday in Broken Hills, 100 miles east of Carson City.
   The blasts will be monitored at three permanent centers
surrounding the Test Site, including one in Deep Springs, Calif.,
25 miles east of Bishop, Calif., where the Soviet technicians have
installed a ton of their own scientific devices for the first time
in this country.
   ``Typical underground nuclear explosions are measured in
hundreds or thousands of tons of TNT,'' Dr. Thomas Cochran, senior
staff scientist of the Natural Resources Defense Council told the
news conference. ``By detonating only 10-15 tons, we will show that
it is possible to detect very small explosions.''
   By comparison, the bill passed in the House on Thursday called
for a ban on all underground nuclear explosions equivalent to more
than 1,000 tons of TNT if the Soviet Union agreed to do the same.
   One objection to a test ban has been that low-yield blasts could
go virtually undetected, particularly if they were muffled in deep
caverns. The equipment being used in Nevada is designed to be
sophisticated enough ``to feel the difference between nuclear and
industrial explosions and ... very small earthquakes,'' Cochran
said.
   In addition to the equipment from the Soviet Academy of Sciences
and the Natura Resources Defense Center, the University of
Nevada-Reno and the University of Wisconsin are taking readings at
23 sites and the U.S. Geological Survey has installed 120
seismometers and recorders along a line from the northwest corner
of the state to its southern tip 450 miles away.

   Gunmen today killed a farmer
acquitted of killing a separatist leader in 1984. He was the first
European settler to be killed in this French Pacific island
territory since the latest wave of separatist violence began a week
ago.
   Separatist guerrillas who kidnapped 23 lawmen freed an assistant
prosecutor and ordered him to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists.
   The killing of Jose Lapetite, 31, on his farm on New Caledonia's
west coast brings to seven the number of deaths since Melanesian
separatists attacked a police station April 22 on the island of
Ouvea. All of the victims until now have been either gendarmes or
native Melanesians.
   Lapetite's brother, Jean-Claude, said he heard shots fired from
the bush about midday but did not see the assailants.
   Lapetite's father, Raoul Petite, 62, was reported missing after
the attack and believed kidnapped by the gunmen, but he was found
at his home, said friends of the family who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Raoul and Jose Lapetite and three other brothers were implicated
in the Dec. 5, 1984, killing of 10 Melanesian separatists in
Hienghene, on the island's east coast.
   Among those killed were two brothers of Jean-Marie Tjibaou,
chief of the Kanak Socialist Liberation Front, a political movement
seeking independence from France.
   Seven European settlers accused of the attack, including the
Lapetites, were acquitted by a court in Noumea last October.
   Native Melanesians, who make up 43 percent of the territory's
145,000 people, are known as Kanaks. Many of them desire
independence.
   About 36 percent of New Caledonians are European, with the rest
primarily Asian or Tahitian. Most of the population wants to remain
under French control.
   Assistant prosecutor Jean Bianconi was released from a cave on
the island of Ouvea and told to pursue negotiations with French
authorities. Bianconi was the second hostage in two days released
to mediate.
   On Thursday, Capt. Philippe Legorjus, chief of the French
anti-terrorism force, flew by helicopter to talk to French
authorities in Fayaoue, a village on Ouvea, an island of the
northeast coast of New Caledonia.
   The kidnappers threatened to kill their remaining hostages if
the men did not return to the rebel hideout, a system of caves 110
miles north of Noumea.
   Legorjus, Bianconi and five police officers were seized by the
separatists Wednesday as they sought to negotiate the release of
the 15 lawmen kidnapped on April 22.
   The hostages were among 27 people abducted in a bloody attack at
a police station that left four gendarmes dead. Twelve of those
hostages later were freed.
   The attack was aimed at halting Sunday's French presidential
elections on the island.
   Also on Thursday, Bernard Pons, minister for overseas
territories, said in Noumea that he has asked the government to
outlaw the Kanak front.
   In Paris, Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac referred to the
Kanak front as a ``terrorist faction'' that does not represent the
New Caledonian population.
   ``I will do everything so that this group is reduced,'' Chirac
said during a televised debate with Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand, his rival in presidential runoff elections May 8.
   ``What counts today is the liberation of the gendarmes and
judicial offical,'' Mitterrand said. ``But what counts tomorrow is
dialogue.''
   Yeiwene Yeiwene, the No. 2 leader in the Kanak political group,
said banning the organization ``would not settle the crisis in New
Caledonia and will not stop the Kanak people from taking the fight
for independence to its end.''
   An estimated 4,000 French troops and gendarmes are in New
Caledonia.
   The kidnappers demanded police reinforcements be removed from
the islands. They asked that mediators be sent from Paris to
discuss a new referendum on self-determination.

   Thunderstorms raced across the Northwest today, bringing heavy
rain and strong winds that ripped down trees and power lines.
Lingering April showers continued to drench the Northeast, with
flood warnings posted in two states.
   The thunderstorms developed Thursday night across eastern
Washington and Idaho with winds gusting to 63 mph at Hanford, Wash.
In northern Idaho, winds whipped down power lines and trees,
sparking a fire east of Coeur d'Alene.
   Scattered showers fell elsewhere across western portions of
Washington and Oregon.
   In the Northeast, heavy rains moved into New Hampshire and
southern Maine on Thursday night bringing some small rivers and
streams to bank-full.
   High water closed some roads in northern new Hampshire and the
Pemigewasset River was expected to crest at three feet above flood
stage late today in Plymouth. At least one family was briefly
stranded by high water and one house was moved off its foundation,
authorities said.
   Up to two inches of rain was reported in southwest Maine. Flood
warnings were in effect until noon today for parts of Maine and New
Hampshire.
   Very cold air in the lower atmosphere in the Northeast helped
produce snow in parts of West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
   Skies were mostly clear this morning over a large part of the
nation from Florida across the southeast and the Mississippi valley
to North Dakota. Skies also were clear over most of Nevada and
California.
   Today's forecast called for showers from eastern Ohio across the
northern and central Appalachians to the middle and northern
Atlantic coastal states; showers and thunderstorms from the
northern and central Rockies to the Pacific Northwest, extending
over the southern half of the Plains and Louisiana.
   High temperatures will be in the 40s and 50s from New England
across the northern and central Appalachians to the Great Lakes
region; in the 50s over much of Oregon and Washington; in to the
80s across southern Florida and Texas; in the 60s or 70s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Duluth, Minn., and Yellowstone, Wyo., to 77 degrees at
Key West, Fla.

   A mentally retarded man who lived on
Duluth's streets was convicted of first-degree murder in the death
of another street person who was borderline mentally retarded.
   A jury delivered the verdict Thursday against Robert Webb, 30,
after 13 hours of deliberation. The conviction carries a mandatory
life sentence.
   The body of the victim, 33-year-old Barbara Ann Ward, was found
in an alley a year ago. She had been suffocated.
   The two-week trial included testimony from about 50 people,
including street people, neighborhood residents, social workers and
police detectives. Among those testifying were people with mental
disabilities who were on medication and had difficulty remembering
events.
   Webb's attorney, Fred Friedman, said he will seek to get the
verdict dismissed on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient
to sustain a conviction.

<TEXT>
   Customs investigators in London seized 3.5 tons of
Afghan hashish in the first-ever narcotics bust involving Britain
and the Soviet Union, authorities said today.
   ``The drugs came from Afghanistan, overland through the Soviet
Union. The Soviet authorities got wind of that and agreed to
cooperate in tracking them, letting them out of the Soviet Union
and to the United Kingdom so that we were able to seize them
here,'' said Home Office Minister Peter Lilley.
   Officers tracked the drugs from Kabul, the Afghan capital, by
rail across the Soviet Union and by sea from Leningrad to London's
Tilbury docks, said a Customs and Excise spokesman who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said five men, all British, were arrested Thursday night. It
was not known whether the Soviets made any arrests on their own
territory.
   The spokesman said the seizure, codenamed Operation Diplomat,
arose from a visit by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to Moscow
last year. During the visit, British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze discussed ways
of cooperating against drugs.
   In July, officials from both countries got together to work out
practical arrangements for fighting drug smuggling, and a
memorandum of understanding was signed in February.
   Just before this, Soviet authorities intercepted the hashish,
hidden in 400 sacks of liquorice root and packed in two containers.
   A British customs agent traveled to Moscow and plans were made
to find the drug traffickers. The Soviets agreed to let the
containers continue their journey under surveillance.
   British investigators took over the watch when the containers
left Leningrad, and when they reached Tilbury a month ago the drugs
were secretly removed from the cargo, which was then repacked and
kept under observation, the spokesman said.
   Last Thursday, officers watched as the containers were collected
from Tilbury and driven to a warehouse in an industrial zone on an
abandoned U.S. Air Force base in Warrington, northwest England.
   The load was then moved to storehouses in London, and the
customs investigators began making the arrests, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, despite a new emphasis on
arms control initiatives and economic improvements, continues to
build and modernize its military might in pursuit of an advantage
over the West, the Pentagon said today.
   Releasing its seventh annual assessment of Soviet forces, the
Defense Department reported there were signs the military
competition between the two superpowers would soon expand into new
fields _ for example, the development of high-tech conventional
weapons instead of nuclear arms.
   Indeed, the strategic nuclear balance ``is essentially stable,''
the report states.
   To date, however, ``we have seen no evidence of the USSR
changing the offensive nature of its force structure and deployment
patterns,'' wrote Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in a preface.
   ``Military output has not been reduced nor has military spending
decreased. On the contrary, the Soviet military budget under
General Secretary (Mikhail) Gorbachev continues to grow at a rate
of 3 percent per year at a level representing 15 to 17 percent of
their GNP.''
   By comparison, Pentagon spending consumes about 6 percent of
America's GNP.
   Carlucci, appearing at a Pentagon press confidence, cited
several other developments, including the fact the Soviets now have
two operational long-range nuclear missiles that use mobile
launchers _ the SS-24 and the SS-25 _ while the United States has
none.
   He also highlighted what he said was the first extensive,
unclassified review of a Soviet program to construct underground
bunkers, command centers and secret subways to protect their
leaders in the event of a war.
   ``There can be only one purpose for these shelters _ to provide
the Soviet leadership the ability to fight a protracted, nuclear
conflict,'' Carlucci asserted. ``These facilities contradict in
steel and concrete Soviet protestations that they share President
Reagan's view that nuclear war can never be won and must never be
fought.''
   But while Soviet military power is ``formidable,'' Carlucci
continued, ``we must not be overawed.''
   ``Rather, we must strengthen our resolve to preserve our
security and our freedoms. There is no mystery as to what America
should do in the face of Soviet military power,'' he said.
   This year's review is the last to be prepared by the Reagan
administration.
   The 175-page glossy booklet differs substantially from the
earlier reports in that it tries harder to gauge who's leading in
various technologies and regions of the world, rather than just
reporting what weapons have been added to the Soviet arsenal over
the last year.
   Indeed, the report for the first time carries a subtitle: ``An
Assessment of the Threat,'' and acknowledges that in areas such as
naval power and high technology the United States and its Western
allies still enjoy an advantage.
   The report does point to new weapon developments, though. Among
them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Soviets will soon deploy operational units of their new
Blackjack long-range bomber. Deployment of the new rail-mounted
SS-24 nuclear missile has now begun, and production should start
soon for a more accurate version of the huge SS-18 intercontinental
ballistic missile, the mainstay of the Soviet arsenal.
   _Production of self-propelled artillery pieces is at an
``all-time high;'' two new attack helicopters, the Havoc and Hokum,
``are expected to enter serial production soon,'' and the Soviets
have begun fielding ``a new tank derived from the T-72, exhibiting
improved protection, better mobility and enhanced firepower.''
   _Russia will complete a major upgrade of its anti-ballistic
missile defense system protecting Moscow ``in 1988 or 1989.'' A new
``Pill Box'' radar to help with tracking and targeting for that
system is ``nearing completion at Pushkino.''
   _``The Soviets are on the verge of deploying a variety of
sophisticated cruise missile systems,'' and continue to lead the
West in the pace of their activities in outer space.
   _In the area of Star Wars, the Soviet Union, like the United
States, is unlikely to develop small ``kinetic kill'' rockets that
could be placed in space to shoot down nuclear missiles at long
range. The Soviets could, however, ``deploy a short-range,
space-based system for space station defense or close-in attack by
a maneuvering satellite in the near future.''
   The report also spotlights for the first time Soviet efforts to
develop the equipment needed for ``radio-electronic combat'' _ the
use of electronic jamming and deception techniques to disrupt U.S.
and allied radio communication systems.
   On the strategic nuclear side, the report concludes the United
States can deter a Soviet attack and continue to press for
additional arms control agreements, so long as it continues
President Reagan's program of introducing weapons such as the B-1B
and Stealth bombers and the MX missile while pursuing Star Wars
research.

   Criminal complaints have been issued
against two additional white students in connection with a fight
among two black students and several whites at the University of
Massachusetts.
   The February incident sparked a six-day takeover of a campus
building by minority students.
   The complaints, issued Thursday in Northampton District Court
against David C. Johnson and Stephen Wolff, bring to six the number
of men charged with assault and battery and assault for purposes of
racial intimidation.
   Both Johnson and Wolff withdrew from the university after the
incident.
   Earlier complaints were issued against Johnson's brother,
Daniel, who had been visiting the campus, and William J. McPhail,
another white student who has since withdrawn from classes, plus
the two black students, Jerome Smith and James Cunningham..
   All are scheduled to be arraigned on May 19.

<HEAD>U.S. Condemns Death of Imprisoned Czech Rights Activist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pavel Wonka, a human rights activist who
died suddenly in a Czechoslovak jail, had asked the Helsinki human
rights conference to make sure he was not silenced in prison, a
U.S. official said today.
   Warren Zimmermann, chief U.S. delegate to the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, condemned Wonka's imprisonment
and said the conference had a ``special obligation to Wonka and to
people like him.''
   The conference adopted the Helsinki accords on human rights in
1975.
   Prison authorities did not explain Wonka's death and official
media in Czechoslovakia have not reported it. Human rights groups
have said that the activist was beaten in detention.
   Frantiski Dolezel, the chief Czechoslovak delegate to the
conference, said Wonka died of emphysema.
   ``As we record and mourn his untimely death, we must also
condemn the wholly unjustifiable imprisonment and mistreatment he
suffered while serving his term,'' the U.S. diplomat said.
   Wonka, who was released Feb. 26 after serving a 21-month prison
sentence, was to be under ``protective surveillance'' for three
years after he was freed. He was rearrested on April 5 and
sentenced to another five-month jail term on unspecified charges
April 21.
   Zimmermann said that in his March 3 message, Wonka said people
in the Soviet bloc should be made more aware of how their laws
affect their rights and freedoms.
   ``My right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the
constitution of Czechoslovakia. Experience, however, has taught me
not to depend too much on such declarations,'' Zimmermann quoted
Wonka as saying.
   ``Therefore, I have learned to be careful and I am taking the
liberty to ask the ... governments of all the signatory states to
see that my voice is not silenced _ under some pretext _ in
prison,'' the message said.
   Several international groups have asked the Prague government to
allow independent doctors to attend Wonka's port-mortem.
   Wonka, an auto mechanic by profession, had sought to run for
Parliament as an independent candidate for his hometown in northern
Bohemia. He was known to be suffering from some intestinal problems
but was not fatally ill, according to an emigre source.

<HEAD>Columbus Sheriff Removed from Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Columbus County sheriff has been
removed from office by a judge who ruled that he had failed to
comply with court orders, falsified court documents and kissed two
women against their will.
   ``I definitely feel betrayed, and I definitely feel my
intentions were not to do anything wrong,'' said former sheriff
William Rhodes. ``I do feel like ... the things I have done in law
enforcement, I tried to do right.''
   Rhodes, 59, said after Thursday's ruling that testimony by
current and former employees had confirmed his suspicions that many
of them were working against him. He said several lied, or were
mistaken, in their testimony about events at the department.
   ``I think I had a fair hearing,'' he said. ``The one thing I
would say is, it helped me find out what I wanted to find out about
the people I was dealing with.
   Superior Court Judge Robert H. Hobgood said he found evidence
supporting all 14 allegations made in a petition filed by District
Attorney Michael Easley that sought Rhodes' removal for willful
misconduct or maladministration in office.
   Easley's petition followed Rhodes' guilty plea last month to
misdemeanor charges of obstructing justice and attempting to
obstruct justice.
   Rhodes admitted he informed an attorney associated with a local
country club that state Alcohol Law Enforcement agents were on
their way to the club for a raid on beer selling without a permit.
   Rhodes testified Thursday that his actions were not intended to
obstruct justice, but the judge found that he ``knew or should have
known'' that his telling about the raids would result in illegal
beer supplies being hidden before agents arrived.
   The judge also found that the sheriff directed one of his
deputies to falsify a jail record to show that a defendant had
served time in the county jail.
   The judge also ruled that Rhodes violated court orders by
allowing the temporary release of inmates to visit their families
or to perform cleanup duties for the county.
   Hobgood also found that Rhodes had kissed two women _ one 15 and
another 20 _ without their consent.
   County Coroner Henry Smith Rowan will serve as interim sheriff
until the county commissioners name a replacement to fill Rhodes'
term, which expires in 1990.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who once
threatened to resign if compelled to take a lie detector test, has
authorized limited and voluntary use of polygraphs in State
Department criminal and security investigations.
   Shultz, in a statement he submitted Thursday to a Senate
appropriations subcommittee, sharply questioned the accuracy of
such tests. ``It should never be acceptable in matters affecting
the reputations and the livelihoods of individuals,'' he said.
   And yet, Shultz said, ``lie detector tests have a limited place
in our security program'' in certain situations. He told the
committee these included requests by State Department workers to
establish their innocence and in criminal counterintelligence or
personnel security investigations.
   Shultz said a third circumstance for their use was when a State
Department employee volunteered to work in an intelligence agency
that required polygraph tests.
   But, Shultz said, the tests would be given only with the consent
of the individual.
   ``It is no secret to the Congress or to this committee that I
have consistently opposed the use of lie detector tests as a tool
for screening or managing people,'' Shultz said.
   ``Nor do I believe that we can single out one class of State
Department employees for special treatment just because they are
called a security service.''
   He said the regulations in which he had authorized lie detector
tests were ``clear, circumspect in scope and protect individual
rights.''
   In December 1985, Shultz said he would resign rather than be
forced to take a polygraph test under a security program that had
been ordered by President Reagan. He called the tests inaccurate
and unscientific.
   Reagan subsequently gave Shultz discretion to decide whether
polygraphs would be given in the State Department.

   The Reagan administration has reached a
tentative agreement with Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega under which he will resign as defense chief but remain on
in Panama for the time being, a U.S. official said today.
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said the settlement is
``less than ideal'' because the administration had initially
insisted that Noriega leave Panama upon his resignation as part of
a transition to democratic rule.
   ``We have to settle for three-fourths of a loaf,'' the official
said.
   The administration had been concerned that any solution that
allowed Noriega to remain on in Panama could enable him to retain
effective control even if he surrendered his post as commander of
the Defense Forces.
   But the official said that Noriega, once he steps down, would be
like a ``cop out of uniform'' and would cease to be the dominant
force in Panama's political life.
   The timing of Noriega's resignation and the question of whether
he eventually will go into exile remain up in the air and are
subject to future negotiations, the official said.
   The Washington Post said in today's editions that Noriega is
known to prefer the Dominican Republic if he is forced into exile.
   On Thursday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater hinted that
the admininistration was backing away from its demand that Noriega
leave Panama as part of a settlement.
   The administration goal, he said, was for Noriega to ``leave
power.''
   Fitzwater had indicated earlier the arrangement did not
represent a policy change, but President Reagan and others had said
in previous statements no acceptable settlement could be reached
until Noriega left Panama.
   Fitzwater said: ``Our policy is that Gen. Noriega must go, which
means leave power. We've talked about that a number of times. We
have said we prefer him to leave Panama, but the policy issue is to
leave power.''
   On March 22, Reagan was asked by reporters if he'd be satisfied
if the military strongman would step down, but not leave his
country.
   ``We feel Noriega should leave Panama,'' the president replied.
   On March 28, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said,
``The way to end this crisis is to get him (Noriega) out of the
country.''
   The Post quoted unnamed sources as saying that Noriega has
agreed to resign in ``a matter of weeks'' and would permit free
elections and the restoration of constitutional government.
   Noriega has said only that he would be willing to step down from
his post before national elections set for May 1989 if certain
conditions are met.
   The scaling back of the U.S. demand occurred as a top State
Department official, Michael Kozak, was in Panama for his second
round of talks with Noriega in less than two weeks. The official
said Kozak was back in Washington today.
   The administration has not acknowledged that Kozak has met with
Noriega on either visit in an apparent attempt to make it easier
for the general to arrange a face-saving way out. Officials believe
the more Noriega is seen to be under U.S. pressure to step down the
less cooperative he will be.
   The Post said the tentative deal was worked out during secret
negotiations this week between the two. Administration officials
have been anguished by Noriega's ability to hang on to power in the
face of a severe cash-flow crisis that has meant no paychecks for
thousands of Panamanian workers.
   Among other measures, the United States has frozen Panamanian
assets in the United States and cut off payments to Panama for
services relating to Panama Canal operations.
   The administration also has continued to recognize the
government of President Eric Arturo Delvalle even though he was
ousted by Noriega's supporters two months ago.
   Noriega was indicted on drug charges in February by two grand
juries in Florida. U.S. officials have informed Noriega he will not
be subject to extradition here if he agrees to seek political exile
in a third country. Spain has offered Noriega conditional exile.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today invited the
District of Columbia's highest court to consider whether gun
manufacturers may be held liable in civil suits for deaths and
injuries caused by cheap handguns.
   The advisory opinion was issued by the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here about the dismissal of a civil suit against the
manufacturer of the .22-caliber pistol presidential assailant John
W. Hinckley Jr. used to shoot President Reagan in 1981.
   It invited the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which
interprets local law in the nation's capital, to determine whether
to adopt a 1985 finding by Maryland's highest state court that gun
manufacturers are liable for injuries and deaths caused by the
criminal use of so-called Saturday Night Specials.
   The panel of three federal circuit judges found that the
Maryland decision ``was based on public policy considerations''
expressed in that state's gun-control laws.
   ``The district's gun control statute... places limitations on
handgun ownership and purchases that are at least as strict as the
Maryland provisions concerning handgun possession'' that formed the
basis of the 1985 decision by Maryland's highest court, the panel
said.
   ``Such a reassessment is permissive, not mandatory'' by the
local appellate court, the federal panel said.
   Maryland's legislature recently voted to outlaw all cheap
handguns, but that change in policy should not be a factor in the
D.C. court's review of the issue, the federal panel said in an
opinion written by Circuit Judge Abner Mikva.
   The advisory opinion follows by a year a decision by the same
appellate court upholding the dismissal of Roehm of Germany as a
defendant in civil suits filed by others wounded during Hinckley's
attack on Reagan.
   Roehm, which makes the guns through its U.S. subsidiary R.G.
Industries of Miami, had been sued for $20 million by White House
press secretary James Brady and former D.C. police officer Thomas
Delahanty.
   Both were wounded along with Secret Service Agent Timothy
McCarthy when Hinckley shot Reagan on March 30, 1981.
   The shooting has left Brady confined to a wheelchair and
Delahanty's wounds forced him to retire from the police force.
   A suit against Hinckley by the three men is scheduled to go to
trial May 16 in U.S. Distict Court here.
   Two of the three judges in today's opinion, Kenneth Starr and
Harry Edwards, participated in last year's holding that gun
manufacturers could not be held negligent for failing ``to prevent
criminals from using their products.''
   That decision also found that ``the strict liability claim fails
because there is no allegation that the gun failed to operate
properly. The gun was not defective.''
   Because the 1987 opinion was not published by the court, it is
not legal precedent.
   In a concurring opinion to today's ruling, Starr expressed
regret that the court did not refer last year's issue for the same
study by the D.C. court.
   Starr said that if the D.C. Court of Appeals holds gun
manufacturers can be sued, the federal appellate court can
reconsider whether to reinstate the suits by Brady and Delahanty
against Roehm.
   The court said that a review of the liability standard was
appropriate because the District of Columbia was carved out of
Maryland and ``derived its common law from the state.''
   The Maryland decision, by a unanimous Court of Appeals, also
involved a lawsuit against Roehm.
   The state's highest court said the manufacturer or marketer of a
Saturday Night Special knows or ought to know ``that he is making
or selling a product principally to be used in criminal activity.''
These guns are ``largely unfit'' for legitimate uses, the court
found.

<HEAD>University Wants Restraint Order Thrown Out</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Tuskegee University have
asked a judge to drop his order that temporarily blocks the school
from prohibiting students who owe $300 or more in overdue fees from
attending classes.
   University President Benjamin Payton said Thursday the 10-day
temporary restraining order obtained by students weakens the
university's loan collection policy.
   Payton said the order issued Wednesday by Circuit Judge Howard
F. Bryan was unfair. He said neither school officials nor their
attorneys were contacted to state their position before Bryan
issued his order.
   The university's policy kept students with overdue fees from
attending classes and taking final exams, which begin next week.
   That sparked a week of protests, including demonstrations and a
sit-in, at the predominantly black private institution, followed by
the students' plea to the judge.
   Leaders of the Student Government Association, which directed
the protests, have said school officials should have warned
students earlier in the semester about the crackdown.
   University officials said the crackdown was prompted by abuse of
an installment payment plan. They estimate some 2,000 students owe
almost $1.5 million.
   Payton said the order ``saddens me deeply and it jeopardizes the
financial well-being of the university, including its undermining
of the process that had resulted in significant payments of
delinquent student fees.''
   He said it is ``revealing and unfortunate'' that students who
said they didn't have funds to pay their fees had gotten money to
take the issue to court.

   If imitation is the highest form of flattery,
the Pentagon's annual book on ``Soviet Military Power'' is basking
in compliments.
   The Soviet Union has issued its own version, ``Whence the Threat
to Peace.'' And Tom Gervasi, a critic of the U.S. military, this
spring published what he calls ``an annotated and corrected''
version of ``the Pentagon's propaganda document.''
   Other military experts say that although the Pentagon book is
not perfect, it is more accurate and comprehensive than either the
Soviets' or Gervasi's version.
   The latest edition, released by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
today at a Pentagon news conference, addresses some of the
criticism by including more information and tables comparing NATO
and Warsaw Pact force levels, and acknowledging that the West leads
in such areas as naval power and high technology.
   The latest, 175-page volume, which for the first time contains
an index to weapons and photographs, reflects Carlucci's desire for
a more balanced and thorough approach.
   ``You'll note we have taken a somewhat different approach this
year than in previous years. During my testimony (before Congress)
earlier this year, I received a number of requests for an
assessment of how Soviet military capabilities relate to our
national interests, our military capabilities and those of our
allies,'' Carlucci told the news conference.
   ``Furthermore, I believe it is especially important to share
with the public as comprehensive a view of the trends and
implications of Soviet military power as possible. And so this year
the scope of the book has been expended ...'' said Carlucci. ``We
welcome criticism.''
   In September 1981, then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger
released the first edition of the book in a presentation beamed by
satellite to Europe. The administration was waging a campaign for a
$1 trillion military buildup to close the gap on what he called
Soviet military superiority.
   Although Weinberger billed the glossy, 99-page booklet as a
compendium of ``scrubbed'' intelligence reports on Soviet defense,
analysts outside government called it a rehash of information
already available in public.
   The glossy book contained colorful maps, charts, photographs and
artists' renditions of Soviet weaponry. The Pentagon published a
Russian-language version, which diplomats in Moscow circulated
among Soviet contacts.
   The Kremlin was not pleased.
   The Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda published a lengthy
front-page editorial describing the Pentagon book as a ``big lie''
designed for ``simpletons.''
   ``It is to be hoped that the foreign public will be able to
judge the worth of the latest rotten fruit of Pentagon
propaganda,'' Pravda said on Oct. 17, 1981.
   By 1984, however, the Kremlin decided to weigh in with its own
effort, ``Whence the Threat to Peace,'' drawing largely on Western
publications to back Soviet claims that Washington was the chief
instigator of the arms race.
   In his version issued this spring, U.S. author Gervasi was no
less harsh than the Kremlin.
   Gervasi wrote that in the Pentagon version, ``even the most
basic facts are distorted'' as part of Reagan administration
efforts to prove that the United States is on the losing end of a
military gap.
   Gervasi's version includes the 1987 edition of the Pentagon
book, overlaid with his own commentaries, for the most part
corrections of the range and capabilities of Soviet and American
weaponry.
   ``In almost every case, the Americans have taken the lowest
estimate for U.S. capabilities and the highest for the Soviets,''
Gervasi said in his book and in a telephone interview.
   Military expert David Isby says that Gervasi, too, plays with
the numbers.
   Gervasi, he says, ``believes that the Soviet Union, no matter
what it's flaws, is never as bad as the United States. He looks for
any figure that shows a Soviet weapon to be less capable.''
   For example, Gervasi says that the Pentagon is incorrect in
saying that the new Soviet 2-S-7 203mm howitzer has a range of 18
miles, and that instead it has a range of 10.8 miles. Gervasi's
figure is for a 203mm gun made in 1931, rather than the latest
Soviet version.
   Gervasi noted that some of the artist's renditions appear to be
wildly inaccurate, a claim that Isby says is justified in part. An
early edition of the book carried a purported drawing of the Soviet
T-80 tank, but it looked more like the U.S. M-1, said both Isby and
Gervasi.
   Some of the Pentagon figures have been contradicted in testimony
by administration officials on Capitol Hill, or by other
authoritative works, says Isby, author of ``Weapons and Tactics of
the Soviet Army.''
   ``But generally, the Pentagon does a good job,'' Isby said in an
interview.
   Condoleeza Rice, an expert on the Soviet military and professor
at Stanford University, shares Isby's assessment of the Pentagon
book.
   ``I find it pretty useful, although from time to time, you find
errors,'' she said in an interview.``I find Gervasi a lot less
useful.''
   Gervasi, Rice and Isby agreed that although the Pentagon book
has improved over the years, it still lacks a workable comparison
of individual Soviet and U.S. weapons, or overall forces. That
issue probably cannot be answered authoritatively as long as the
superpowers disagree over who is ahead in the arms race.

<HEAD>Japanese Terrorist Suspect Pleads Innocent to Weapons Possession
Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man linked to a left-wing Japanese
terrorist group pleaded innocent today to weapons possession
charges, 17 days after police found three pipe bombs in his car
along the New Jersey Turnpike.
   FBI agents have been investigating a possible link between the
man, Yu Kikumura, 36, and a USO club bombing in Naples, Italy, that
killed five people, including a U.S. servicewoman. Italian
authorities have linked the bombing to the terrorist group.
   Italian authorities have confirmed that Kikumura was in their
country in February. FBI spokesman James J. Knights said he could
not comment on a continuing investigation.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry has identified Kikumura as a
suspected member of the Red Army terrorist group.
   Kikumura, 36, was arrested April 12 at a New Jersey Turnpike
service area after police found three sophisticated homemade bombs
and falsified papers in his car.
   At Kikumura's arraignment, defense attorney William Kunstler
questioned how Kikumura's case was assigned to the court of U.S.
District Judge Alfred E. Lechner Jr., a judge Kunstler's partner
called the most conservative in the state.
   ``We were told it was rotation, but who knows?'' Kunstler said.
``We just want to see if it wasn't maneuvered.''
   U.S. Attorney Samuel Alito Jr. denied the charges.
   ``I resent his accusations to the press yesterday that we
calculated the judge to which it was assigned,'' Alito said.
``There certainly was no effort to link the return of indictments.''
   Kikumura pleaded innocent to all charges in the 12-count federal
indictment, nine of which relate to the bombs and three stemming
from alleged misuse of a visa and a passport.
   If convicted on all 12 counts, he could face 90 years in prison.

   As they waited for rescue, crewmen from
the USS Bonefish refused to take a hovering helicopter's rescue
line for themselves, passing it to their mates instead, a sailor
from the ill-fated submarine said.
   ``They kept passing it feeling somebody would need it more than
they. The first people we took were those who couldn't swim well.
Then we found we had some people who needed medical attention,''
said Ronald Larsen, of Bellows Falls, Vt., the chief electrician's
mate on the vessel.
   Larsen on Thursday said the crew members conducted an orderly
evacuation of the ship through thick, poisonous smoke after a fire
and explosions damaged the diesel-electric submarine.
   Three crewmen were killed in Sunday's accident while 22 others
from the 92-man crew suffered smoke inhalation. Two remained
hospitalized in satisfactory condition Thursday.
   The 219-foot Bonefish was involved in maneuvers off the coast of
Florida at the time of the fire. Larsen said the three dead men
were were relatively new to the boat and may have been doomed by
their unfamiliarity with its layout.
   Officials at the Atlantic fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va.,
say the first explosion took place in the submarine's forward
battery compartment while the vessel was cruising at periscope
depth.
   The batteries are used to power the sub when it is below the
surface, and recharging them generates hydrogen gas, which can
explode if allowed to accumulate.
   However, Larsen said a fire initially broke out in the crew
living quarters but apparently couldn't be contained.
   ``They had this small fire in berthing and a couple of people
manned fire extinguishers and attempted to put it out,'' he said.
Initial reports that the fire was under control were followed by
reports it was spreading, he said.
   ``From everybody I talked to there was an explosion later, maybe
five minutes down the road,'' he said.
   He said ``there's a lot of anger among the crew'' over
speculation in the media that high levels of hydrogen in the
battery compartments may have caused the explosions.
   ``I know for a fact we had zero percent hydrogen in the battery
well,'' he said.
   Chief Petty Officer Terry D. Borton, a spokesman at Atlantic
Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, said today the Navy had no comment
on the sequence of fire and explosions aboard the Bonefish.
   Following the explosions, the Bonefish surfaced and its captain,
Cmdr. Mike Wilson, ordered the crew evacuated to the Kennedy and
frigate USS Carr, which were nearby.
   No one was available for comment on Larsen's account, an officer
at fleet headquarters said Thursday night. Telephone calls to four
spokesmen at home went unanswered or were not returend.
   The Bonefish was expected to arrive in Charleston, its homeport,
by early afternoon, said Chief Petty Officer Joseph C. Mowery,
spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk.
   Meanwhile, the Navy prepared for a memorial service Saturday for
the crewmen who died.
   Navy officials said the remains of Lt. Ray Everts, 30, of Naoma,
W.Va., Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelow Jr., 39, of
Willis, Texas, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren,
21, of Pisgah Forest, N.C., had been removed from the vessel and
flown to the Naval Hospital in Charleston.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Copyright Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters today predicted swift House action
on a bill allowing the United States to adhere to a century-old
international copyright treaty and strengthen its hand against
foreign piracy of records, tapes and computer technology.
   The measure was approved Thursday by a voice vote of the House
Judiciary Committee without the so-called ``moral rights''
provision sought by Hollywood film makers to help prevent
unauthorized coloring and other alterations in works sold to
television broadcasters.
   Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chief sponsor of the House
bill, said the moral rights issue will be considered later in
separate hearings by his Judiciary subcommittee, which considers
copyright issues.
   A similar measure, also without a moral rights provision, was
approved April 14 by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Approval of
the legislation by the full House and Senate was expected within
the next few weeks, congressional staff aides said.
   If the treaty is then ratified by a two-thirds majority of the
Senate, the United States would join 76 other nations that
subscribe to the Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Works, which sets the world standard for copyright
protection of creative works exported by any of the signatory
nations.
   Kastenmeier and other supporters of the bill said U.S. adherence
would help stem piracy of American-owned works in the computer and
entertainment fields. U.S. producers of records and tapes, for
example, lost an estimated $558 million in sales in 1986 because of
foreign counterfeiting and piracy, according to the U.S.
International Trade Commission.
   ``I want to bring this to the full House for a vote right
away,'' Kastenmeier said today through a spokeswoman. ``Every day
the U.S. waits to join Bern is another day that the gold medalist
of the world intellectual property Olympics stays on the bench for
lack of proper credentials.''
   Kastenmeier said the bill would allow the United States to
improve copyright relations with 24 of the 76 subscribing nations.
   ``Joining the Bern convention is a trade issue as well as an
artistic concern,'' he said. ``...We enhance our own political
credibility in our global efforts to raise copyright standards and
reduce piracy. The more we achieve in all those areas, the better
we protect American jobs and American creativity.''
   At a hearing before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on March 3,
film makers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas appealed for a
statutory ``moral rights'' ban on changes in a motion picture by
its financial backers or buyers without the consent of directors
and screenwriters.
   ``American law does not protect our painters, sculptors,
recording artists, authors or film makers from having their life
work distorted and their reputation distorted,'' said Lucas, who
directed the hit movie ``Star Wars.''

   A car ferry crashed into a dock
and tipped over, tossing 21 crewmen into the water, police said.
Authorities said no serious injuries were reported but further
investigations were under way.
   In a brief statement issued to the news media, Bremerhaven
police said the accident occurred when the 607-foot ferry hit the
Seebeck dock in this northwestern port city.
   All 21 crewmen were plucked out of the water and were being
checked for possible injuries, the statement added.
   The statement provided no details about whether any passengers
were on board, or where the vessel was coming from when the
accident occurred.
   A Bremerhaven police official, speaking to The Associated Press
on the condition of anonymity, said that circumstances surrounding
the accident were still incomplete and that an investigation was
under way.
   Rescue crews in boats and helicopters quickly converged on the
scene after the accident.

<HEAD>Dukakis Urges Reagan Not To Veto Trade Bill; Bush Begins Campaign
Swing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Dukakis, Bush, Jackson comments in top 11 grafs,

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis appealed to
President Reagan today to think about workers who lose their jobs
when plants close, but Republican George Bush dismissed his
comments, saying, ``He can talk about pink slips. I want to talk
about competitiveness.''
   Bush, at a breakfast with supporters in Fort Wayne, Ind.,
criticized Dukakis' backing of trade legislation that includes a
provision requiring that notice be given to workers before plant
closings. Reagan is expected to veto the measure, which won
congressional approval this week.
   The vice president said the fall election would give voters a
clear choice between strong Republican leadership and
``old-fashioned liberal Democrats talking compassion and delivering
misery.''
   Dukakis, campaigning in Columbus, Ohio, said, ``I hope the
president will take the time to think about the three million
American workers who lose their jobs in this country every year
through plant shutdowns. In at least half those cases, those plants
shut down with little or no notice to those most affected _ their
own employees.''
   ``These people are our neighbors,'' Dukakis said in prepared
remarks. ``They deserve better from their employers. They deserve
better from America.''
   Democrat Jesse Jackson, far behind Dukakis but doggedly
remaining in the race, criticized Dukakis today on the issue of
South Africa, telling students at a high school in Cleveland that
both Bush and Dukakis should label South Africa a terrorist state
because of its backing of extremist rebels in Mozambique.
   He accused the rebels of atrocities and said ``South Africa is
responsible for that behavior.''
   The candidates were spending the day in the two states that have
the next two big primaries next Tuesday.
   One day earlier, the Massachusetts governor, criticized by Bush
for lacking foreign policy experience, met with Spain's prime
minister, Felipe Gonzalez, and the two conversed in Spanish, aides
said.
   Jackson, on Wednesday, expressed determination during an Ohio
campaign swing to stay in the race despite a series of setbacks.
   ``We're winning every day on this long and tortuous journey to
the White House,'' Jackson told supporters in Canton on Thursday.
Later, in Akron, he vowed: ``Nothing and nobody is going to turn us
around.''
   Ohio offers 159 delegates, and a Gallup poll earlier this month
indicated Dukakis led Jackson in the state by a 2-1 margin.
   Dukakis widened his delegate lead over Jackson, as delegates
from the camps of now-inactive candidates began drifting his way.
New recruits included two former supporters of Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee and one backer of Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois.
   One delegate from New Hampshire, state Rep. Richard Daschbach,
originally a supporter of Rep. Richard Gephardt, said Gephardt had
told him to go ahead and get behind Dukakis. He quoted Gephardt as
telling him: ``It's time to go. ... We've got to get out and
support him (Dukakis).''
   However, Deborah Johns, Gephardt's press secretary, said the
Missouri congressman, who abandoned his presidential bid in March,
remains neutral.
   ``As far as I know, he is not planning to endorse anyone soon,''
she said.
   According to the latest Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis
has 1,276 to Jackson's 852, with 2,081 needed to nominate. Aides
are beginning to suggest that Dukakis could clinch the nomination
during the primary season, which ends June 7 with big contests in
New Jersey and California.
   On the Republican side, Bush, who achieved a mathematical lock
on the nomination in Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary, now has 1,146
delegates, according to the AP count. Former television evangelist
Pat Robertson, who technically remains a candidate, has 31.
   Robertson's campaign has been given two weeks to submit
financial records in a federal investigation of the tax-exempt
status of Robertson's religious broadcasting network. U.S.
Magistrate Rebecca Smith in Norfolk, Va. extended a show-cause
order on Thursday until May 12, for documents originally requested
by the Internal Revenue Service last December.
   Most of the information requested has been turned over, but
Assistant U.S. Attorney Raymond Jackson has asked for additional
material, including bank records for Robertson groups in Texas,
Michigan and Virginia.

<TEXT>
   Entertainer Dean Martin gave himself a
clean bill of health when he returned to the stage nearly six weeks
after he left a ``Rat Pack'' tour with Frank Sinatra and Sammy
Davis Jr. because of a kidney problem.
   ``Everything's perfect, I feel great,'' Martin told an audience
Thursday night at Bally's Hotel and Casino, where he began a
weeklong engagement.
   Before the show, spokesman Mort Viner downplayed rumors that
Martin left the tour March 21 because of a split with Sinatra.
   ``There's absolutely nothing to that,'' Viner said. ``It's
totally false.''
   Martin, 70, had been on the nationwide ``Rat Pack'' reunion tour
with Sinatra and Davis when he returned to Los Angeles and checked
into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Hospital spokesman Ron Wise
described the illness as a ``flareup of an old kidney problem.''
   Martin was released from the hospital March 25 but ordered by
his physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, to remain home for three to
four weeks and skip the remainder of the tour.
   In his show Thursday night, Martin alluded to his former road
companions.
   ``Frank sent me a kidney, but I don't know whose it was,''
Martin joked.
   He also lauded Davis and Jerry Lewis, Martin's former partner
before the two had a bitter split years ago. Martin praised Lewis'
work for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
   Martin said he felt he was ``home'' at Bally's, where he has
appeared for years.
   ``It's so good to be off the road,'' he said.
   Martin, Sinatra and Davis became known as members of the ``Rat
Pack'' in the late 1950s and early 1960s when they made movies
together, partied together and became fixtures on the Las Vegas
stage.

   British military authorities have begun
killing the ancient cat population of the Akrotiri peninsula in
south Cyprus.
   Scores of cats have been destroyed in gas chambers since the
campaign was launched six weeks ago, said sources at the British
air base on Akrotiri who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``This is not an extermination campaign,'' said British military
spokesman Maj. Johnnie Rogers. ``The number of feral cats in the
area has reached sufficient numnbers to warrant some kind of
control measures.''
   According to local lore, the cats were introduced to Akrotiri in
the 4th century to control the snake population.
   The president of the Cyprus animal protection society, Loulla
Josephides, said that ``getting rid of the cats of Akrotiri will
upset the balance of nature. The whole area will soon be infested
by snakes again.''

<TEXT>
   Indian President Ramaswami Venkataraman
was blocked from entering the inner chamber of a Hindu temple
because he and his guards were wearing shirts, it was reported
Friday.
   The president and his bodyguards were visiting the Nataraja
Temple in southern Tamil Nadu state on Thursday when the incident
occurred, the Statesman newspaper said.
   The Calcutta-based newspaper said temple workers formed a human
chain around the inner chamber to prevent the party from entering.
It said that although Venkataraman was willing to remove his shirt,
as is customary at the shrine, he felt it would be ``unbecoming''
for his guards to do so.
   The paper said the president walked around the inner sanctum but
worshipped from the outer courtyard.

   A court sentenced three men to life
in prison for beheading a farmer they thought was a wizard, the
Philippines News Agency said Friday.
   A court in the central city of Cebu returned the sentences
Thursday for Elanito Quijano, 25; Edwin Layug, 23; and Danilo
Lapinid, 24, the state-run news agency reported.
   They were charged with hacking, stabbing and beheading Abundio
Baring two years ago in Valencia on Cebu Island, 360 miles south of
Manila.
   One of the men was carrying Baring's head in a plastic bag when
they were arrested. They told police they killed him because he was
a wizard.
   A fourth, Edgar Gonzales, 19, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison.
   Judge Godadro Jacinto ordered the four to each pay $1,000 to
Baring's family.

   Sixty-nine inmates at the Denver and Adams county
jails have signed a letter of support to a priest who called on
parishioners to turn in their guns and sign pledges they won't own
firearms.
   ``In these times of so much violence, guns are the demon,'' said
letter, sent Thursday. ``The purpose of guns is killing and hurting
other human beings. Some of us know how very true this is.''
   The Rev. Marshall Gourley earlier this month asked that members
of Our Lady of Guadalupe Roman Catholic Church give up their guns,
and his appeal has spread to other churches and received national
publicity.
   So far, only 11 guns have been turned in, but more than 400
people signed the pledge cards.
   The Rev. Jim Sunderland, the jails' chaplain, said he wrote the
letter and passed it around for inmates to sign.
   ``Being a jail chaplain, I know what handguns do,'' he said. ``I
eyed a couple of people as it went around because some were in
there for shooting, and they signed.''
   The letter praised Gourley for a ``small but very important step
toward lessening violence. We hope other pastors and other churches
will follow your example.''

   A 45-year-old Vietnamese refugee hanged
himself in a camp near Bangkok after complaining that he had been
at the camp too long and was going nowhere, camp officials said
Friday.
   The body of Nguyen Thanh Sang was found April 23 at the Phanat
Nikhom camp, about 70 miles southeast of the Thai capital, the
officials said.
   A Western relief official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Sang wanted to resettle in the United States but did not have
documents proving his claim that he had served in the U.S.-backed
South Vietnamese army during the Vietnam War.
   The case was put on hold after U.S. officials interviewed him in
June 1986.
   Sang also apparently had personal problems, the official said.
His family remained behind in Vietnam after he fled to Thailand by
boat in 1986, and he lived alone in a section of the camp that
houses about 9,000 Vietnamese.
   A camp administration official said Sang had tried to kill
himself April 21, but a neighbor notified authorities, who stopped
him.
   Relief officials say there have been a growing number of suicide
attempts among Vietnamese refugees who have spent long periods of
time in the camp because they do not qualify for resettlement.

   The government's chief forecasting gauge of
future economic activity shot up 0.8 percent in March, pointing to
continued growth for the rest of the year, the Commerce Department
said today.
   That, combined with a revised 1.3 percent growth rate in
February, gave he Index of Leading Economic Indicators its best
back-to-back performance since the last two months of 1986, when
growth rates of 0.8 percent and 2.2 percent were recorded.
   February's rate had previously been reported as a much smaller
0.9 percent.
   The strength represented a remarkable turnaround in a
forecasting gauge that at one point after the October stock market
collapse was sending out signals of an impending recession.
   When the December index numbe was first released, it marked the
third consecutive monthly decline in the index, the traditional but
not infallible warning of a recession.
   But the initial calculations are subject to substantial
revisions even months afterward. With today's revision, the only
declines recorded since the stock market crash were a 1.2 percent
drop in November and a 0.7 percent fall in January.
   Analysts said the big gains in the past two months reflected the
surprising strength the economy has shown so far this year, good
news for Republicans hoping to retain the White House.
   President Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said,
``The size and broad-based nature of the March increase in the
leading indicators are significant and good news. They suggest that
the economy remains on a steady course and that a healthy climate
for prosperity will continue.''
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said that ``the
leading index suggests the economy will be headed onward and upward
as we move through the second half of the year. From the point of
view of the administration, the news on the economy could hardly be
better.''
   Sales of new homes posted a 4 percent gain in March, rising to
an annual rate of 655,000 units, following an even better 14.1
percent jump in February sales. Analysts said the back-to-back
gains showed that the housing industry has shaken off the jitters
which sent sales down for several months following the October
stock market collapse.
   In other good economic news, the government reported Tuesday
that the gross national product grew at a moderate 2.3 percent
annual rate from January though March, far above the declining GNP
which had been feared immediately following the 508-point drop in
the stock market on Oct. 19.
   The February and March increases in the leading index were
likely to fuel growing fears, however, that the economy is
expanding too rapidly and threatening to rekindle inflation.
   Interest rates have been rising in recent days, pushed higher by
investor fears that the economic strength will soon prompt the
Federal Reserve to tighten up on credit conditions as a way of
slowing economic activity.
   The March increase in the index reflected widespread strength as
six of the nine individual indicators showed gains.
   The biggest gain came from a rise in stock prices followed by a
drop in weekly unemployment claims. On Thursday, the government
reported that weekly unemployment claims fell to the lowest level
since December 1973, prompting speculation that the unemployment
report for April, which will be released next Friday, will show a
further decline to 5.5 percent, down from the current nine-year low
of 5.6 percent.
   Other indicators which showed strenth in March were a slowdown
in business delivery times, indicating rising demand, a rise in
building permits, faster growth in the nation's money supply and a
rise in raw materials prices, indicating higher demand.
   Three indicators held the index back. The biggest negative
factor was a drop in the length of the average workweek, a drop in
plant and equipment orders and a decline in manufacturers' orders
for consumer goods.
   The various changes left the index at 193.3 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   After the GNP report was issued, Beryl Sprinkel, the president's
chief economic adviser, said it showed the administration's 2.9
percent GNP forecast for the year was right on track.
   He disputed contentions that a big jump in consumer demand,
which had provided much of the first quarter strength in the GNP,
raised any dangers of inflation.
   But private economists noted that prices at both the retail and
wholesale level took a big leap up in March and that those factors,
combined with the strong consumer demand, were prompting fears in
financial markets.
   ``If you get growth too fast, then interest rates start going
up. The credit markets are now prepared for higher inflation
because of the faster growth,'' said Tom Megan, an economist with
Evans Economics, a Washington forecasting firm.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., of Lexington,
Mass., said he expected economic growth would slow slightly in the
current spring quarter, helping to quiet fears of an over-heating
economy. But he said the economy would begin expanding at about a 3
percent annual rate in the second half of the year.

   New home sales increased in March for the
second consecutive month, the government said Friday, providing new
confirmation that the housing industry has shaken off its stock
market crash jitters.
   The 4 percent rise in March, on top of an even stronger 14.1
percent jump in February, pushed sales to the highest levels since
August, according to a joint release of the departments of Housing
and Urban Development, and Commerce. However, the pace was still 9
percent below last year.
   Analysts predicted this healthy, but modest, sales level would
continue into summer, but said rising mortgage interest rates
threaten to choke off growth in the second half of the year.
   New single-family homes were sold at a seasonally-adjusted rate
of 655,000 units last month, up from the month-earlier sales pace
of 630,000 units.
   Sales had dropped 5.8 percent in January, 6.2 percent in
December and 4.3 percent in November, raising fears that weakness
in housing could spread to other sectors of the economy and help
push the country into a recession.
   ``I am pleased to see we are picking up the pace,''' said Mark
Obrinsky, an economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
``But I doubt that we will see much further pickup.''
   Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which had risen above
11.5 percent just before the Oct. 19 stock market crash, dipped
below 10 percent in February and March. But, they have since edged
up to 10.3 percent.
   In the short term, rising rates may actually help sales, said
Kent W. Colton, vice president of the National Association of Home
Builders, because ``buyers will realize rates have bottomed out and
will want to lock in a rate before they go up higher.''
   However, analysts expect rates to be approaching pre-crash
levels by the end of the year and said that could dampen housing
activity.
   New home sales this year are following a pattern established by
sales of existing homes and construction starts of new homes. Both
earlier reports indicated housing is recovering from low winter
levels.
   Sales of existing homes increased 2.5 percent in March after an
identical increase in February, according to the National
Association of Realtors. The Commerce Department said construction
of single-family homes jumped 7.1 percent in March after a 8.9
percent increase in the previous month.
   The March increase in new home sales was accompanied by a sharp
decline in prices. The median, or mid-point, price of new homes was
$101,100 in March, down 8.1 percent from February, which in turn
was 6.8 percent lower than the January record of $118,000.
   The average price of a new home fell 5.4 percent to $130,300 in
March, after a 4.9 percent decline in February.
   The March rise in sales was propelled by a 23.6 percent increase
in sales in the West and a 8.4 percent climb in the South. Sales
were down 18.9 percent in the Midwest and dropped 12.5 percent in
the Northeast.
   John Tuccillo, chief economist of the realtors group, said price
averages are falling because housing activity is stronger in
regions where prices are lower. Also, he said lower-priced homes,
such as those purchased by first-time buyers, are selling more
briskly than home in the upper brackets.

Special Olympics at Bloom Township High School something to vie for
besides the satisfaction of winning.
   Most of the medals and ribbons for the event were stolen or
vandalized, but the television talk show host and the Chicago Board
Options Exchange each contributed $2,000, and several large
businesses also pledged money so the event could go on, spokesmen

   Jean Vitelli, coordinator of the meet, said she discovered the
damage and thefts Monday when she went to a warehouse containing
equipment and awards for the games. She said the vandals even stole

estimated that 1,200 of the 1,800 medals that were to be awarded at
the meet had been stolen or ruined.
   Because of the donations from Ms. Winfrey and others, there will

   Ruth Gersh, news editor in The Associated Press'
Louisville, Ky., bureau, has been named chief of bureau in Des
Moines, Iowa, succeeding Dave Tomlin, who was named deputy director
of AP membership based in New York.
   The appointments were announced Friday by Louis D. Boccardi,
president of AP.
   Gersh, 34, a native of Tuckahoe, N.Y. graduated from the
University of Pennsylvania and received a master's degree in
journalism from the University of Michigan. She worked for The
Baltimore Sun and the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot before joining AP in
Richmond, Va., in 1978.
   She was named correspondent in Norfolk in 1980, then transferred
back to Richmond in 1982 to cover state government. In 1986 she

   Tomlin, 41, is a native of Providence, R.I. He received
bachlor's and master's degrees in international studies from Johns
Hopkins University and worked for the Newport News (Va.) Daily
Press and the Washington Star before joing AP in Columbus, Ohio, in

   President Reagan's senior aides apparently got
the message when Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker told them he will
not tolerate attempts to undermine Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, the president's spokesman said today.
   An administration source said earlier that Baker told
subordinates Thursday he had ``had it'' with a spate of news
stories about underground efforts to win Meese's ouster.
   Baker reminded aides that Reagan has repeatedly stated his
confidence in Meese, and told them ``those people who disagree with
that should come to Howard Baker and talk,'' said the source,
speaking on grounds he not be identified publicly. He said Baker
left no doubt that such a meeting would center on the continuing
job status of the complaining aide.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he did not believe anybody had
been in to see Baker as a result of his comments.
   ``I don't think anybody missed the message,'' Fitzwater said.
``They'd be too dumb to work at the White house if they did.''
   Baker reminded aides that Reagan has repeatedly stated his
confidence in Meese, and told them ``those people who disagree with
that should come to Howard Baker and talk,'' said the source,
speaking on grounds he not be identified publicly. He said Baker
left no doubt that such a meeting would center on the continuing
job status of the complaining aide.
   The source said Baker made it clear that because Reagan still
has confidence in Meese, his staff should respect that. He said
Baker told aides that he, too, believes in Meese's innocence.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay has been examining Meese's
assistance to the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a proposed $1
billion oil pipeline project. Also under investigation are Meese's
meetings with regional Bell telephone company executives at a time
when he owned $14,000 in Baby Bell stock. In addition, McKay is
looking into the $40,000-a-year job for the attorney general's
wife, Ursula Meese, that is being funded by the foundation of a
Washington family that has leased real estate to the Justice
Department.
   The administration source said Baker was not directly challenged
by anyone in the meeting.
   ``You should have seen all the heads at the table, nodding up
and down, and probably someone at that table had been leaking
stories,'' he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about Baker's
threat, said, ``Senator Baker told the senior staff that the
president supports Ed Meese and the White House supports Ed Meese
and if anybody questions that policy, then they shouldn't.''
   Asked whether Baker, a former senator from Tennessee, had
suggested that those in disagreement might leave the White House,
Fitzwater said Baker had said, ``Come see me if you have any
problems.''
   A spate of stories has appeared recently quoting unidentified
administration and White House officials as saying the time has
come for the resignation of Meese. These people were quoted in the
various accounts as saying that a group of Reagan's close friends
and advisers had taken part in an underground effort, supposedly
with Nancy Reagan's support, to work for Meese's departure.
   However, Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen, denied that
the first lady had played a role in any such move.

   Ingmar Bergman's staging of ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night'' is a smash with audiences and critics
more than three decades after the play premiered on the same
Stockholm stage.
   The revival of Eugene O'Neill's classic at the National Dramatic
Theater earned what one critic called the best review he ever
wrote. The play opened April 17 and is sold out through August.
   This triumph for Bergman, who turns 70 on July 14, comes at a
time the director describes as the twilight of his career. He has
said he has made his last film.
   But his schedule is unusual for a man claiming to approach
retirement. His modernized Swedish-language version of Hamlet won
plaudits in London. The play goes to New York in June.
   He also is preparing Shakespeare's ``A Winter's Tale,'' and an
opera to open here in 1991. In November, he published a
best-selling autobiography, ``Magic Lantern.''
   But seldom in his 50-year career has the applause of his home
critics been louder than for the O'Neill play.
   ``This is sensational. World theater, if anything,'' wrote
Ingmar Bjorksten, drama critic of the Svenska Dagbladet, in what he
called his most enthusiastic review ever.
   Bergman's handling of the play was ``full of human knowledge''
and marked by a ``sympathy and warmth unusual for him.''
   ``Brilliant,'' headlined Aftonbladet, which published three
glowing reviews. It called Bergman ``a brilliant editor'' for
cutting an hour from the original script ``with nothing of
O'Neill's essentials removed.''
   The play stars Bibi Andersson, whom Bergman launched on an
international career in the 1950s and with whom he had a two-year
affair 30 years ago.
   ``I have never experienced such box office pressure for a play
like this. People are writing and calling from all over the
country, even Denmark and Norway,'' theater director Lars Lofgren
told The Associated Press.
   The Dramatic Theater, which celebrates its centennial this year,
was given the rights to stage the world premiere of O'Neill's
unpublished plays after his death in 1953.
   Tom Olsson, the theater's librarian and an O'Neill scholar, said
that according to the playwright's widow Carlotta, O'Neill was
pleased with the theater's handling of his early plays and their
success on the Swedish stage.
   ``Long Day's Journey'' premiered on Feb. 10, 1956, and the play
was such a hit that it entered theatrical legend here. It won the
1957 Pulitzer Prize for drama.
   Bergman was absent from the revival's opening night 32 years
later. He said later he was looking after his flu-stricken wife,
Ingrid, and did not want to draw attention from the actors.
   His associates said Bergman also was suffering from a painful
hip which plagued him through the rehearsals and was scheduled for
an operation shortly after the premiere.
   But he received a special ovation when the ensemble bowed to an
empty seat in the first row after their ninth curtain call.
   Bergman's movies, which he began making in the 1950s, won world
acclaim for their brooding explorations of troubled relationships.
   Outraged by an charge of tax evasion which was later dropped,
Bergman lived in self-imposed exile in West Germany for seven
years, before returning home in 1982 to direct the film ``Fanny and
Alexander.''
   Bergman's 70th birthday is likely to be the subject of national
celebrations. Chaplin magazine, published by the Swedish Film
Institute, published a 90-page English-language special edition in
April with tributes from leading movie directors.
   ``Probably the greatest film artist, all things considered,
since the invention of the motion picture camera,'' said Woody
Allen.

<HEAD>Reagan May Finally Endorse Bush on Tuesday</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aides to Vice President George Bush said
Friday that President Reagan may finally endorse Bush at a victory
party next Tuesday although the president's spokesman said a
decision has yet to be made.
   Bush aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there is a
strong possiblity the president will weigh in with his formal
support at a party planned to celebrate Bush's clinching of the GOP
nomination.
   ``We're over the top, so we may as well take advantage of it,''
said one aide.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater would not confirm that Reagan
would appear at the celebration at a Washington, D.C., hotel but
added: ``I won't tell you it ain't going to happen.''
   The previously scheduled event will be held as the Ohio, Indiana
and District of Columbia primary returns come in Tuesday night,
which was when Bush advisers initially had believed the vice
president would go over the 1,139 delegates needed to lock up the
GOP nomination.
   However, Bush reached that level last Tuesday, after the
Pennsylvania primary.
   There has been no question of Reagan's endorsement of his vice
president, only the matter of when it would come. Reagan had vowed
to remain publicly neutral so long as the GOP nomination was in
contention.
   The only remaining GOP rival is former television evangelist Pat
Robertson, but he has ceased active campaigning and has conceded
victory to Bush.
   Asked when Reagan would begin to make campaign appearances for
Bush, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters on
Friday: ``It hasn't been decided.''

   Rep. Pat Hickey rarely has occasion
to eat his own words, but he might have wished he had rather than
make a bet with House Majority Tony Ribaudo.
   For his loss, Hickey found himself eating a section of the
Missouri House rules Thursday in front of his colleagues.
   Ribaudo told lawmakers that Hickey, recognized as the House
expert on rules and parliamentary procedures, had bet him earlier
in the week about whether a particular rule existed.
   He said Hickey had agreed to eat a copy of the rule if it could
be found in writing. With that, Ribaudo held up a copy of the rule
and handed it to Hickey.
   Hickey took the paper, stepped to a microphone, tore a piece
off, put it in his mouth and began chewing amid the laughter of
fellow lawmakers.

   The definition of a dog has become a
bone of contention in the Illinois Legislature.
   Under a proposal approved by a House panel Wednesday, wolves,
coyotes and crossbreeds no longer can be considered dogs _ and that
should make it easier for one county to deal with its budget woes.
   The problem is that farmers whose livestock are killed by dogs
are partially reimbursed from dog registration fees collected by
county health departments.
   While wolves, coyotes and crossbreeds are not considered dogs by
most county prosecutors, Jo Daviess County State's Attorney J.
Christopher Moore interprets the definition to include them.
   So county health officials saw their funds go toward paying for
slain livestock, costing the county thousands of dollars, according
to state Rep. Richard Mulcahey.
   Mulcahey's bill would revise the definition by limiting it to
the canis familiaris branch of the family Canidae _ domestic dogs,
in other words.
   The full House is scheduled to consider the issue Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Government and rebel leaders began a
second day of meetings today in a climate of mutual distrust,
having made little apparent headway in talks on achieving a lasting
peace.
   The two delegations ended their closed-door session Thursday
night with neither side offering comment on what progress, if any,
had been made.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega started the meeting by calling
for a 30-day extention to the 60-day truce that ends June 1.
   The U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, rejected the proposal.
   Contra leaders arrived Thursday for a second three-day round of
high-level meetings to work out details of the cease-fire agreement
they signed with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government March 23
in the southern border town of Sapoa.
   The two sides have agreed on little since signing the
preliminary peace accord, which aims to end the 6{-year-old war
that has claimed more than 26,000 lives.
   In a surprise move, the government announced Thursday that the
Contras may receive immediate humanitarian aid if it is distributed
by the International Red Cross. The Sapoa accord calls for
humanitarian aid to be provided to the rebels only after they
gather in seven mutually agreed cease-fire zones.
   ``It is an effort to ease the pacification process that restores
peace and the possibility of national reconciliation,'' Deputy
Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco told journalists.
   Under the accords, the rebels were to have moved into the zones
two weeks ago, but the two sides have been unable to define the
security and operating conditions within the zones.
   Many Contra fighters have moved into the general areas of the
zones over the last few weeks. But journalists traveling to the
isolated regions said the combatants are wary of the pact.
   The Sandinista proposal calls on the Contras to lay down their
arms, an issue not specifically mentioned in the Sapoa accords.
   ``We insist that first we should discuss and reach an agreement
about the modus operandi'' within the zones, said Contra leader
Roberto Ferrey.
   He said that to accept the government's proposal would be
tantamount to surrender.
   The government says the laying down of arms is basic to the
agreement _ but the Contras say they will do so only when Nicaragua
is on ``the irreversible road to democracy.''
   The two sides met Thursday at the Camino Real Hotel near the
airport. The Contras are isolated from contact with the general
public, but are permitted to make brief forays to speak to waiting
journalists at a nearby hotel.
   The Contras' first three days of high-level talks in Managua
began April 15 and netted nothing more than an agreement to meet
again.

<HEAD>Residents Want Liquor Banned At New Hotel Unless Parking Increased</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developers of a $41 million luxury hotel near
Beverly Hills have agreed to expand their parking after affluent
neighbors threatened to put a cork in the hotel's liquor permit
application.
   Homeowners who don't want party-goers' cars parked around their
neighborhood will have their chance Tuesday at a hearing by the
Board of Zoning Appeals on the hotel's liquor permit request.
   ``No parking! No booze!'' was the residents' rallying cry at a
recent meeting.
   ``The neighborhood is going to get nothing but more problems out
of this hotel,'' said Harald Hahn, president of a homeowners group
near the 11-story, 311-room Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel being built on
Beverly Boulevard across from the posh Beverly Center shopping mall.
   The scheduled summer opening of the hotel will mark the return
of restaurateur Patrick Terrail's trendy Ma Maison eatery, which
closed on Melrose Avenue in 1985.
   Although the hotel's 328-space garage provides the legal minimum
number of slots, it should be bigger because any overflow will
spill onto already crowded streets, said Diana Plotkin of the
Beverly-Wilshire Homes Association.
   The hotel's developers have agreed to lease several dozen spaces
at a nearby bank for nighttime and weekend use and to squeeze 382
cars into the garage by allowing valet parking only.
   ``We sympathize with what they want: to preserve their life
style and the neighborhood,'' said James Keegan, president of the
firm developing the hotel. ``But at the same time we didn't throw
$40 million into a hole in the ground to have a dry hotel.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts by House Democrats to advance a
sweeping South African sanctions bill were derailed Friday when
partisan squabbling broke out in the Foreign Affairs Committee and
the measure became entangled with a separate bill on Ethiopia.
   The legislation would cut off virtually all economic relations
between the United States and South Africa within a year. It is
seen by supporters as building upon the limited sanctions imposed
two years ago to force Pretoria to moderate its apartheid policy,
which deprives majority blacks of political and civil rights.
   But the measure is opposed by business interests as too harsh to
have its intended effect, and many Republicans who supported
limited sanctions in 1986 have said they will fight the Democrats
this time.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, had planned to begin work on the sanctions bill
Friday. He was forced to postpone his panel's meeting until next
week, however, after the measure became entangled in a dispute
about a separate, Republican-sponsored bill to condemn the Marxist
government of Ethiopia.
   ``I guess it reflects some of the rising political tensions'' of
this election year, said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a senior
committee member.
   Republicans were holding up the South Africa sanctions bill as
leverage to first force action on the Ethiopian measure. That bill
urges President Reagan to cut off imports of Ethiopian coffee and
deny trade preferences if the Soviet-aligned government continues
to impede relief efforts for starving people in its northern
provinces.
   Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam on April 6 ordered
foreign relief workers out of the provinces of Tigray and Eritrea,
where his forces are at war with secessionist rebels. Mengistu has
been accused of trying to starve his own people into submission,
and more than 2 million people are reported to be at risk of
starvation.
   The Ethiopia sanctions measure, sponsored by Rep. Toby Roth,
R-Wis., was to have been acted on Friday before the committee
turned to consideration of the South Africa sanctions bill. But
Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., objected, saying the measure was poorly
written and was being rushed through without proper referral to the
trade subcommittee, which he heads.
   As the committee's meeting hit impasse and broke up, Republicans
cried foul. ``It's a sad mark of politics and procedure,'' Roth
said. ``We've got millions of people starving to death.''
   He accused Bonker, who is running for the Senate in his
forestry-oriented state, of trying to use the situation to advance
a pet bill imposing restrictions on exports of unprocessed logs.
   Bonker had told reporters that bill might come before the full
Foreign Affairs Committee this week, but that did not happen.
Bonker denied any connection between the two bills.
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he would continue to use House
rules to block consideration of the South Africa bill until the
Democratic-controlled committee acts on Ethiopian sanctions. ``The
Ethiopian bill is much more significant at this point that South
Africa,'' he said.
   But one Democrat said the Republicans were merely using every
tactic they could to delay further action on South Africa, which
Democrats see as a potent political issue in their favor.
   ``When you're looking to sidetrack an issue, your best bet is to
light forest fires all around the place,'' said Rep. Gary Ackerman,
D-N.Y. ``It's a testy time.''

<TEXT>
   New York City police are among the more
restrained in the nation in using their guns, experts say, contrary
to a common perception reinforced by this week's killings of an
unarmed woman and a veteran police officer.
   ``Many people say ... `They're killing people left and right,'
but that's directly counter to the figures,'' said Thomas Reppetto,
a former Chicago police commander who is president of the Citizens
Crime Commission of New York City, a watchdog group.
   Tighter guidelines for the use of deadly force began developing
after a federal study found that police shootings helped spark 13
riots in the 1960s, said James Fyfe, a former New York policeman
who is chairman of American University's Department of Justice, Law
and Society.
   ``New York was really at the forefront in terms of the degree of
the restrictiveness of the policy, and remains the most restrained
among the large police departments in terms of shooting,'' Fyfe
said.
   None of which consoles Guy Ferraro, whose 31-year-old wife,
Lidia, was killed early Wednesday in a hail of police bullets after
a car chase that began when she ran a red light.
   ``She was defenseless. They surrounded her. It was coldblooded
murder,'' said Ferraro.
   Police said afterward that a sergeant had fired three shots at
the car's tires. Because of a police radio report that shots were
fired, officers who converged on the scene may have thought the
woman fired the shots and was armed, police said. No weapon was
found in her car.
   The same day, a veteran officer was shot during a drug raid. The
fatal bullet came from another officer's gun _ not the gun of a
woman arrested in the raid, as police originally reported.
   Asked if firearms policy would be changed in the aftermath of
the two shootings, Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo responded,
``We are constantly reviewing our policy.''
   The sergeant who shot out Mrs. Ferraro's tires apparently
violated a 1985 department regulation against firing shots at a
moving vehicle. The sergeant was suspended.
   Virtually all major police departments have similar rules,
experts said. A 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling said deadly physical
force may not be used to stop a fleeing felon.
   Fyfe, who researched police shootings in New York for his
doctoral thesis, found that a restrictive policy instituted in 1972
led to a sharp drop in the number of fatal police shootings, which
reached 87 in 1971.
   From 1981 through 1984, the average was 33; in the past three
years, it was 15, according to police figures.
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police studied police
shootings in the 57 largest cities from 1975 through 1983. Fyfe
said that in terms of the number of fatal shootings per 1,000
officers, New York had a relatively low rate of 1.36.
   The highest rates were Jacksonville, Fla., at 7.17, followed by
New Orleans at 6.8 and Long Beach, Calif., at 6.1. At the lower end
of the scale were Boston, 1.19; San Francisco, 1.4; Minneapolis,
1.62; and Chicago, 1.71.
   In other major cities, the rate in Dallas was 4.32; Houston,
4.73; Los Angeles, 3.05; Detroit, 3.33; and Atlanta, 3.28.
   Robert Trojanowicz, director of the School of Criminal Justice
at Michigan State University, said that in the past 15 to 20 years,
fatal shootings by police have declined ``because they're getting
extensive training, and policies are becoming increasingly refined,
specific and restrictive.''
   ``In the past,'' he said, ``a person was given a weapon, put on
the street and expected to literally learn on the job.''
   Internal investigations and pressure from citizens make it
``very difficult with current procedures to cover up an errant
police officer's actions,'' Trojanowicz said.

   Tens of thousands of Christians, some huddled
beneath blankets and umbrellas, gathered on the Mall today for a
day of prayer for their churches and their country.
   Evangelist Oral Roberts told the crowd this afternoon how he had
been cured of tuberculosis 53 years ago by ``a man of God.''
   ``The man of God laid hands on me in Jesus' name and said, `You
foul disease, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ, you come
out of this boy.' And brothers and sisters, it was resurrection, it
was divine intervention,'' Roberts said to a cheering audience.
   ``I stand here today, 53 years later, with my lungs sound and
whole, my body healed by the power of God.''
   Earlier, the Rev. Gerald Derstine of Bradenton, Fla., one of the
first speakers at the ``Washington for Jesus'' rally, spoke of
Christians repenting for the sins of the nation.
   ``I am talking about drug addiction, alcoholism and suicides. We
feel prayer in the schools is still an important issue and we
believe abortion still is an issue,'' Derstine said.
   Organizers said the rally attracted people from all 50 states
and from more than 100 countries. Members of many Christian
denominations were present; most of those in attendance were
evangelicals.
   Sponsors said they expected 350,000 people would brave the rain
and cool weather to join in the continuous, dawn-to-dusk prayers
and songs. At noon, a U.S. Park Police spokeswoman, who would not
give her name, said the crowd numbered about 80,000.
   A similar rally in 1980 drew an estimated 200,000 people.
   When the rally ends, seven days of around-the-clock prayers will
begin on the site of the rally.
   Tom Robidoux of Norwalk, Conn., said he took the day off from
work to attend because he felt it would be ``very uplifting to see
this many people all doing the same thing.''
   ``I believe the United States thinks Christians are divided
against one another,'' Robidoux said. ``We're here to show we can
stand together.''
   Dae Anne Fletcher said she traveled to Washington from
Clarksburg, W.Va., because ``I just wanted to add my voice to those
of many others.''
   Before the rally began, the Rev. John Gimenez, pastor of Rock
Church in Virginia Beach, Va., said participants ``are going to
Washington to pray. We're not going there to condemn. We're not
going to denounce. We're going there to point the finger at
ourselves.''
   Indeed, organizers adi the sex-and-money scandals that have
rocked television evangelism gave added impetus to today's rally.
   The rally's aim, Gimenez said at a news conference Thursday, is
to show repentance ``so we can be more effective,'' to reconcile
differences within the church and between races and neighborhoods
and to ``restore the church to holiness.''
   ``When we started organizing this, there were no publicized
scandals in the church,'' Gimenez said of the sex-and-money
troubles that brought down television evangelists Jimmy Swaggart
and Jim and Tammy Bakker. ``The scandals just emphasize the need
for we who are Christians to come together.''
   Today's rally was intended to be non-political, and that's why
none of the presidential contenders was invited to speak, Gimenez
said. Pat Robertson, who is seeking the Republican nomination for
president, was one of the key speakers at the rally eight years ago
but was not invited to speak this time, Gimenez said.
   An exception for political figures was made for a videotaped
message from President Reagan.
   Although the rally was dedicated to reviving old-fashioned
Christian values, it relied on the latest in technology to get its
message across. Four huge screens, similar to those in baseball
parks, were set up to show the activities on stage and messages
like those from Reagan.
   John Staggers, chairman of the D.C. Networkers for Christian
Affairs in Washington, said he was impressed by the rally
organizers' determination to help the residents of Washington.
   ``I'm usually against groups that come to Washington for a day
and leave us with our problems,'' Staggers said.
   Organizers asked each of the participants to bring a can of food
for the poor and the homeless, and they agreed to help
Washington-area churches set up drug treatment centers.

   Two teachers are being questioned and three
classes have been canceled at California State University's
Northridge campus after students reported being offered top grades
for selling raffle tickets, officials said.
   Students reported that the three independent studies courses in
African history and culture also required no classroom attendance
and assigned no course work, said campus spokeswoman Ann Salisbury.
   University Vice President of Academic Affairs Bob Suzuki
announced Thursday that the classes had been canceled and the
school's campus police had launched an investigation.
   ``Because we have been informed that there was no syllabus for
this class and that most students never met with their instructors,
it appears to me that grades were offered in exchange for
activities not directly related to an officially approved course of
study,'' Suzuki said.
   The university is also considering disciplinary action against
two teachers and may turn over the findings of its investigation to
the district attorney's office, Ms. Salisbury said.
   She said interviews with 30 students enrolled in the courses led
to the probe.
   The two teachers being investigated were Eleazu S. Obinna, a
17-year faculty member, and William J. Bellamy, a first-year
lecturer, campus officials said.
   The raffle tickets were allegedly being sold on behalf of United
Crusade Foundation Inc., a non-profit, charitable organization
founded by Obinna.
   ``I have done nothing wrong,'' the Nigerian-born Obinna, 54,
said Thursday. ``I believe this is something concocted by the
administration, not from complaints by students.''
   Obinna said he required 45 hours of course work and graded
students on their participation in minority community affairs.
   Bellamy declined comment.
   Student Laural Isles, 18, said Obinna told her to sell 20
tickets at $5 each for an A grade in his class.
   ``I personally didn't know who was even in charge of the
class,'' said Trey Whitaker, 18, another student in Obinna's class.
``My understanding was that the proceeds were going to charity and
the grade was contingent on how much we sold.''
   Suzuki's statement said the university also was looking into the
legal status of United Crusade Foundation Inc.
   Obinna said the organization has sponsored summer youth job
programs and holiday meals for the homeless. He said it recently
lost its non-profit status, but he renewed it with the state
Thursday.

<TEXT>
   U.S., Cuban, South African and Angolan officials
will meet here next week for a two-day conference on troop
withdrawal from Angola and independence for South-West Africa, the
Foreign Office said today.
   The U.S. delegation will be headed by Chester Crocker, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for African affairs and Washington's
chief diplomatic troubleshooter in southern Africa, the U.S.
Embassy said.
   The talks will be held at a secret location in London Tuesday
and Wednesday, British and U.S. officials said.
   The other delegates were not identified, but a South African
Foreign Ministry statement said the participants would not be of
Cabinet rank.
   ``Discussions between the United States, Angola, South Africa
and Cuba, on troop withdrawal from Angola and independence for
Namibia, will take place on May 3 and 4 in Britain,'' a British
Foreign Office spokesman said.
   ``We are pleased to have facilitated and welcome this further
step in the negotiating process.''
   Crocker was in London this week and had talks with his Soviet
counterpart, Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin.
   South-West Africa, or Namibia, is ruled by South Africa in
defiance of a 1966 U.N. demand to give it independence.
   South Africa has said it is willing to give Namibia
independence, but insists Cuba withdraw its estimated 40,000 troops
from neighboring Angola.
   The United States, which has been trying for nine years to
mediate an agreement, backs South Africa's demand that the first
move be a Cuban withdrawal.
   Angola demands that South Africa and the United States stop
backing pro-Western rebels fighting to overthrow its Marxist
government. It says South Africa has 9,000 troops with heavy
artillery in Angolan territory, while South Africa says it has not
had more than 3,000 men there at one time since May 1987.
   South Africa has been waging a 21-year war with Namibian
independence fighters based in Angola, while Angola has been
wracked by civil war since 1975.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
South Africa's ally in the Angolan civil war, got U.S. aid worth
$15 million last year, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.
   In the past few months, most of the heavy fighting has been
around the strategic southeastern city of Cuito Cuanavale.
Cuban-backed Angolan forces still hold the city, although it has
been under regular attack by South African and UNITA troops. The
fighting appears to have reached stalemate in the past two months.
   The town, 190 miles north of the border with South-West Africa,
has a strategic airstrip and is used as a staging post for Angolan
army operations against UNITA.

<HEAD>USSR Pursuing Massive Underground Shelters Program, Pentagon Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has been pursuing an
``enormously expensive'' program of constructing huge underground
bunkers and subways to protect its leaders and allow them to fight
a protracted nuclear war, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Friday.
   While the existence of such complexes has been known for years,
``only recently have we been able to do the full analysis of the
enormous extent of this program _ hundreds of meters deep, with
subways under several cities,'' Carlucci added.
   ``To have something comparable, we'd have to have facilities
where we could put every governor, mayor, every Cabinet official
and our whole command structure underground with subways running
here and there. There's just no comparison (with U.S. shelters
built in the 1950s).''
   Carlucci highlighted the Soviet Union's so-called passive
defense program as he released the 1988 version of ``Soviet
Military Power,'' an unclassified study of what the Russian
military has been doing over the past year.
   The defense secretary cited the underground work as just one
example of how Soviet actions paint a different picture than the
public statements of Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, with his
emphasis on arms control initiatives and improving the economy.
   Without elaborating, Carlucci also made it clear the United
States was developing a means of threatening the undergroud bunkers.
   ``Although the (Soviet) program strikes at the very basis of
deterrence, we have a number of initiatives underway that will
provide us an effective response to this program at a fraction of
the cost that it must have taken the Soviets to undertake it,'' he
said.
   Last year, Defense and Energy Department officials acknowledged
work had begun on a new family of ``earth-penetrating'' nuclear
warheads for U.S. missiles.
   ``There can be only one purpose for these shelters _ to provide
the Soviet leadership the ability to fight a protracted, nuclear
conflict,'' Carlucci declared. ``These facilities contradict in
steel and concrete Soviet protestations that they share President
Reagan's view that nuclear war can never be won and must never be
fought.''
   The 1988 review, the last to be prepared by the Reagan
administration, is the seventh such assessment of Soviet forces.
This year's 175-page glossy publication differs substantially from
the earlier reports, though, in that it tries harder to gauge who's
leading whom in various technologies and regions of the world.
   The report does still focus on some new weapon developments,
though. Among them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Soviets will soon deploy operational units of their new
Blackjack long-range bomber. Deployment of the new rail-mounted
SS-24 nuclear missile has begun, and production should start soon
for a more accurate version of the huge SS-18 intercontinental
ballistic missile.
   Carlucci said the deployment of the SS-24 was significant,
because it means the Soviets now have two operational ICBM's that
are mobile ``while we're still arguing in the Congress about
whether we should have one ...''
   _Two new attack helicopters, the Havoc and Hokum, ``are expected
to enter serial production soon,'' and the Soviets have begun
fielding ``a new tank derived from the T-72, exhibiting improved
protection, better mobility and ehnahcned firepower.''
   _``The Soviets are on the verge of deploying a variety of
sophisticated cruise missile systems,'' and continue to lead the
West in the pace of their activities in outer space.
   _In the area of Star Wars, the Soviets _ like the United States
_ are unlikely to develop small ``kinetic kill'' rockets that could
be placed in space to shoot down nuclear missiles at long range.
The Soviets could, however, ``deploy a short-range, space-based
system for space station defense or close-in attack by a
maneuvering satellite in the near future.''
   In Europe, the Soviets continue to improve their already large
advantage in conventional weapons and troops. But the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is strong enough to deter attack
primarily because the Soviets believe the Western allies would
resort to nuclear weapons if in danger of being overrun, the
Pentagon said.
   That ability to deter an attack may depend, however, upon
success in developing new types of conventional weapons ``and the
West's current technological lead is threatened by an extensive
Soviet commitment to surpass the United States and its allies.''
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a response written by Washington
correspondent Oleg Polyakovsky, criticized the administration
Friday for continuing to publish the Pentagon review.
   ``The stirring up of the myth about the Soviet military menace
is a traditional method of the U.S. politics, particularly at a
time when the budget is being drafted,'' Polyakovsky said. ``Such a
publication can do nothing but harm to Soviet-American relations.''

   Israeli troops on Friday raided two villages in
southern Lebanon to interrogate residents about guerrilla attacks,
and Moslem worshipers protested on Jerusalem's sacred Temple Mount
and chanted, ``Jews leave!''
   The protest came after underground leaders of the Arab uprising
called for marches and symbolic funerals on Friday, the Moslem
sabbath, to honor 175 Palestinians killed in five months of unrest
in the occupied territories.
   In a new underground leaflet, Palestinian leaders called for
more commercial strikes and protests against the Israeli
occupation. But the West Bank and Gaza Strip remained mostly quiet
on the Sabbath, the second during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
   In southern Lebanon, two militiamen from the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army were killed when their vehicle ran over a land
mine on a side road in Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone,''
which stretches from six to 10 miles north of the border, the army
command said.
   Israel radio said troops entered the villages of Kfar Hamam and
Rachaiya El Foukhar, respectively four and six miles north of the
Israeli border, to interrogate dozens of residents about two
guerrilla infiltrations into Israel Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Two Israeli soldiers and five Palestinian guerrillas were killed
in clashes following the infiltrations.
   Security sources in Lebanon said the troops, aided by their
Lebanese militia allies, focused the searches on the rocky terrain
east of where the guerrillas infiltrated.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were
told five Lebanese villagers had been detained. The military
command would not comment on the report.
   Military officials have linked the recent guerrilla raids to the
5-month-old uprising in the occupied lands and said they expect
more raids aimed at supporting the protesters.
   In Jerusalem, several hundred Moslem worshipers emerged from
noon prayers on the sacred Temple Mount waving outlawed Palestinian
flags and chanting: ``Jews leave! The prophet Mohammed's army is
coming.'' A police helicopter hovered above.
   Another chant glorified Khalil Wazir, the PLO military leader
who was gunned down April 16 in Tunis. Israeli sources have
implicated Israel in the killing but the government has refused
comment.
   Military police, who were stationed on nearby rooftops, did not
intervene and the protest dispersed peacefully.
   Inside the Al Aqsa mosque, a Moslem prayer leader called on
Arabs to ``attack the enemies, attack the non-believers.''
   ``More martyrs for God and the homeland!'' Sheikh Mohammed Siam
told about 7,000 worshipers. ``Our only weapon is Islam. Millions
of eyes are watching us.''
   In the walled Old City in Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinian
shopkeepers opened their stores promptly at 2 p.m., the hour that
underground PLO leaders have instructed shops to open during
Ramadan.
   Israeli police, trying to thwart the PLO instructions, have
tried forcing Arab merchants to open all day or preventing them
from opening at all. Fourteen shopowners are awaiting trial for
violating army orders to open. They could receive two-year jail
terms.
   In the Gaza Strip, small disturbances were reported following
noon prayers in several areas. Initial reports said there were no
injuries.
   The latest underground leaflet, signed as usual by the ``United
National Leadership of the Uprising,'' called on Arabs to practice
civil disobedience and form self-governing bodies to replace
Israeli-appointed Arab officials.
   ``The road to civil disobedience lies through the formation of
more local committees,'' the leaflet said. It called on
Palestinians to strike ``the severest blows'' at Arab officials
viewed as collaborators with Israel.
   The leaflet also called for more commercial strikes, days of
tribute to victims of the uprising and ``days of Palestinian
anger.''
   This week's relative calm in the territories led Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to proclaim that the ``intefadah'' _ Arabic for
uprising _ was fading.
   But an unidentified defense official was quoted in the daily
Jerusalem Post Friday as saying the army did not expect the
uprising to die out soon.
   ``Despite the enormous pressures we have been putting on the
inhabitants of the territories, despite the unprecedented mass
arrests and despite the death toll ... the inhabitants still feel
the uprising is on,'' the official was quoted as saying.
   ``And what matters more than anything else is their own feelings
about it.''

   A mysterious explosion ripped open an
Aloha Airlines jet ``like a convertible'' at 24,000 feet, injuring
60 people and throwing or blowing a flight attendant to her death
before the pilot landed safely.
   ``There was big bang when it happened and everybody looked up
and we were looking at blue sky,'' said passenger Bill Fink of
Honolulu.
   The Boeing 737, with one of its two engines aflame and about 15
to 20 feet of its cabin exposed behind the cockpit and down to the
level of the passenger seats, flew for 25 miles after the blast and
made an emergency landing at Kahului Airport at 2 p.m. Thursday (8
p.m. EDT), airline officials said.
   The cause of the blast on Aloha Flight 243 was unknown Thursday
night, said Kevin Morimatsu, a spokesman for the state Department
of Transportation.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was sending
investigators to the scene and FBI agents were sent from Honolulu
to determine whether the blast was caused by a bomb, said FBI
spokesman Robert Heafner.
   However, sources close to the federal investigation in
Washington said investigators were focusing most heavily on a
possible structural failure that may have been caused by a rapid
decompression and that the force of strong wind at 24,000 feet may
then have ripped away the huge section of fuselage. The sources
spoke on condition they not be identified.
   George Harvey, Federal Aviation Administration area coordinator
for Honolulu, said today he could not confirm whether federal
investigators suspected that a structural failure caused the
fuselage to tear away from the airplane.
   ``It stands to reason that they're checking everything _
structure failure, explosive devices,'' Harvey said. NTSB
investigators will hold their first news conference later today, he
said.
   Another passenger, Alice Godwin of Boulder City, Nev., said she
put on a life jacket and put her head between her knees. ``I sang
all the hymns I knew,'' she said. ``That kept me busy.''
   ``Everybody screamed,'' said Dan Dennin, also of Honolulu.
``However, it was very brief _ the panic. ... The rest of the plane
was intact, and we did not go into any unusual attitudes or
anything like that. I think that people realized the plane was
still flying and they quickly went about the business of doing
whatever they could do to save their lives.''
   Passenger Daniel Westfall, of Novato, Calif., said the plane
``jerked around, up and down.''
   Mark Eberly, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he dropped
to his knees in shock as he watched the plane land with one of its
engines smoking and the section of fuselage missing. ``I saw hair
flying in the wind and arms dangling,'' he said.
   Craig Nichols of Pocatello, Idaho, said after the plane came to
a stop on the ground, he saw ``some really mangled people,''
including one with an arm almost severed.
   ``It looked like a normal landing with the whole top of the
plane gone,'' he said.
   ``It looked like a convertible,'' said Joe Ronderos of Los
Angeles.
   ``It was like somebody had peeled off a layer of skin. You could
just see all the passengers sitting there,'' said George Harvey,
area coordinator for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Honolulu.
   Officials at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the primary subsidiary
of Boeing Co., said there were no fuel lines or other potential
sources for an explosion in that part of the plane.
   ``The fuel is in the wing, the engines are in the wing and the
fuel lines are all right there,'' Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said in
Seattle.
   ``To have it just explode in the air is just unheard of,'' Cole
said. ``I think this is a very unusual circumstance that is not
related to any other accidents we have had.''
   Even in the extremely unlikely event that a turbine blade tore
loose from an engine and ripped into the fuselage, it could not hit
forward from the wing, and the effect would be nothing like what
happened to the Aloha plane, he said.
   The plane was one of nine 737-200s delivered to Aloha in the
late 1970s, said Boeing spokesman David Jimenez. The first 737-200
was put into service in April 1968.
   At a news conference in Honolulu, Maurice Myers, president of
Aloha Airlines, said nothing is stored in the area of the the blast.
   Myers cited the ``extraordinary performance'' of pilot Robert L.
Schornstheimer in bringing the 737-200 in safely. Schornstheimer
has flown for the airline for 12 years.
   ``I give credit to the pilot. He brought that plane down so
smoothly. It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said passenger
John Lopez, 40, of Hilo.
   ``I've had worse landings in normal aircraft,'' Dennin said.
   Sixty people were taken to Maui Memorial Hospital and 12 were
admitted, two in critical condition and four serious, said Dr.
Charles Mitchell, emergency room director. Injuries included burns,
bruises and cuts, he said.
   The missing flight attendant, identified as Clarabelle B.
Lansing of Honolulu, was probably either ejected by the blast or
blown out of the plane by the wind, said Clifford Hue, another FAA
area manager.
   ``I think the stewardess (Mrs. Lansing) had just picked up the
microphone to start talking'' when the explosion occurred, Fink
said.
   Fink and Dennin said some of the passengers hung on to another
standing flight attendant so she would not be sucked out of the
plane, and they praised the cabin crew for helping calm the
passengers.
   The U.S. Coast Guard mounted a search that included a cutter, a
C-130 search and rescue aircraft and two helicopters, said Coast
Guard spokesman Petty Officer Jeffrey Crawley.
   However, searchers found no trace of Mrs. Lansing, a 37-year
employee of the airline, or the missing section of the plane, he
said.
   The explosion occurred southeast of Maui while the plane was at
an altitude of 24,000 feet, the airline said. It said the 110-mile
flight from Hilo on Hawaii Island to Kahului carried 89 passengers,
five crew members and an air traffic controller from Hilo Airport.

   An Auburn University student was
arrested Friday in connection with an incident last month in which
a woman was repeatedly raped and left unconscious at a Florida
State University fraternity house, authorities said.
   Jason J. McPharlin, 19, of the Albama school's Pi Kappa Alpha
chapter, was charged with one count of accessory to a felony and
one count of failure to report a sexual battery, said Florida State
University police spokesman Jack Handley.
   ``The warrants charged McPharlin with having helped carry an
unconscious sexual battery victim from the Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity and leaving her in the hallway of the Theta Chi
fraternity house,'' said Handley.
   McPharlin was to be booked into the Leon County jail under a
$6,000 bond.
   Meanwhile, a three-member Florida State committee met for the
third day to discuss what punishment will be handed out to the
fraternity, two of whose members were charged earlier this week
with raping and brutalizing the 18-year-old woman.
   The fraternity was suspended April 22 pending the hearing.
   An interim grand jury report issued last week said the victim
was raped by more than one person and was found at the Theta Chi
fraternity early March 5 ``intoxicated to a life-threatening
degree.''
   She suffered multiple scratches and abrasions, had crude words
and a fraternity symbol written on her thighs and had a .35 percent
blood-alcohol level, more than three times the legal limit for
driving.
   Byron L. Stewart, 21, of Orlando and Daniel G. Oltarsh, 23, of
Fort Lauderdale, both Pi Kappa Alpha members at Florida State, were
freed on $10,000 bond Wednesday after being charged with sexual
battery in the case. Each could face up to life in prison if
convicted.
   University spokeswoman Annette Lee said the committee
considering permanent sanctions against the fraternity will pass on
its recommendation to Dean of Students James Hayes.
   On Wednesday, the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity at Stetson
University in Deland was suspended for a year following rape
allegations. Stetson officials said there was not enough evidence
to determine if there was probable cause for legal charges.
   The school suspended five students, including two seniors, and
ordered 27 members to move out of their fraternity house because of
sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse at a party.

   In 1933 when the Marx Brothers made the
movie ``Duck Soup'' with its setting in the mythical kingdom of
Freedonia _ with two E's _ Fredonia Mayor Harry B. Hickey
complained to Paramount Pictures.
   ``The name of Fredonia has been without a blot since 1817,''
Hickey said. ``I feel it is my duty as mayor to question your
intentions in using the name of our city in your picture.''
   The Marx Brothers fired back this reply:
   ``Your excellency,'' they wrote. ``Our advice is that you change
the name of your town. It is hurting our picture. What makes you
think you are mayor of Fredonia? Do you wear a black moustache,
play the harp, speak with an Italian accent or chase girls like
Harpo? We are certain you do not. Therefore, we must be the mayor
of Fredonia, not you.''
   Thus began the historic connection between the zany brothers and
this western New York college town, a link to be honored Saturday
in the second annual Freedonia Marxonia Film Festival and Symposium.
   About 1,000 people wearing Groucho glasses and noses are
expected at Fredonia State College for a group picture in the
afternoon. But that's not all.
   There will be a serious speech by Marx Brothers expert Paul G.
Wesolowski and a non-serious duck soup competition. How
non-serious? Well, last year's winning entry was by student Karen
West, who submitted a pet mallard duck paddling around in a washtub
among turnips and carrots.
   The Post Office has thrown itself into the spirit of things and
will be canceling stamps with a postmark that shows Groucho, Harpo
and Chico and has the extra ``e'' in Fredonia.
   Postmaster Robert Kaus says he's gotten about 150 requests for
the cancellation, some from as far away as Belgium, Italy, and the
Soviet Union.

``Treaty Beer'' is nothing but ``hate and prejudice in a can.''
   Gov. Booth Gardner, Sen. Dan Evans, church groups and other
critics on Thursday denounced plans to market the brew in
Washington and called for a boycott.
   The first 2,500 cases of the beer are scheduled to arrive in
Pierce County next week. Profits are to be earmarked for challenges
to Indian treaty rights.
   Dean Crist, president of Stop Treaty Abuse, the group that
created the beer, said his home state of Wisconsin and perhaps 40
other states are having disputes over treaties giving Indians
rights to fish, hunt game and use other natural resources.
   Treaty Beer was test-marketed in Wisconsin and sold more than
70,000 cans in the first week, Crist said. Crist said he expects a
million cases _ 24 million cans _ to be sold every year in
Washington.
   The headline on advertising being run in Washington newspapers
says ``Vote with your mouth.''
   Some of the profits will be used to press for implementation of
Initiative 456, said Steve Arbaugh, president of the Puget Sound
Gillnetters Association, a group of commercial fishermen in
Washington.
   Washington state voters approved the initiative in 1984, calling
for Congress to rescind old treaties that were interpreted by
federal judges as guaranteeing Indian fishermen in Washington the
right to half the fish in their usual and accustomed fishing
grounds.
   In separate actions Thursday, the governor issued a denunciation
and called for a boycott of the beer, and other critics staged a
joint press conference in Seattle.
   ``Treaty Beer is not welcome in Washington and I ask all
citizens to join me in renouncing the effort to market it in our
state,'' Gardner said.
   The governor said ``cooperation, not confrontation'' has finally
been achieved in the wake of the court action as the state has
developed peaceful, joint management of fisheries.
   Gardner added: ``There is very little the state can do to
legally stop the sale of this product _ except to strongly
discourage people to buy it.''
   The Seattle press conference featured comments from Evans,
Indian rights activists, and representatives of the Church Council
of Greater Seattle, the forest industry and environmentalists.
   Evans, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs, said he was ``saddened to think that outside agitators see
our state as fertile ground for their message of hate.''
   Stuart Bledsoe, head of the Washington Forest Protection
Association, blasted the ``rascist mentality,'' and added, ``We
recognize this brew for what it is: hate and prejudice in a can.''
   In a separate press conference later, Crist and Arbaugh denied
they were racist. Crist, who called himself an ardent sports
fisherman, said his group thinks treaties that give special fishing
rights to Indians are unfair to other fishermen.
   ``I don't see it as a Ku Klux Klan issue,'' said Arbaugh. ``I
don't see it as an issue to deprive someone of something. ... I
don't understand why people try to point this out as a racist
issue. Racism is when people get special rights.''
   But Bill Frank Jr., chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries
Commission, called it ``an effort by anti-Indian extremists to
violate treaties.'' He called the beer's promoters ``fringe-element
radicals who consider Indian land and resources fair game to fill
their own pockets.''
   Officials at Schoenling Brewing Co. Cincinnati, which is making
the beer under contract for Stop Treaty Abuse, did not return
telephone messages left Thursday seeking comment.

<HEAD>Report: State Falling Short of Quota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State corrections officials are
consistently falling short of a self-imposed quota of releasing
3,000 inmates a month to ease prison crowding, according to a
published report Friday.
   Despite record high parole approval rates, the quota system
which began in September has hit its goal only one month during a
six-month period, the Houston Chronicle said.
   An examination of Board of Pardons and Paroles records showed
that 3,083 inmates were paroled in October, the only month the
parolee total exceeded the monthly quota.
   In September, 2,668 convicts were paroled, 2,057 were released
in November, 2,441 in December, 2,241 in January and 2,422 in
February.
   During the same six-month period, officials approved parole for
inmates under consideration for the first time at a rate ranging
from 59 percent in January to 80 percent last September. The rate
for February, the most recent month for which figures were
available, was 70 percent.
   The ``revolving-door'' plan was instituted last fall as a
quick-fix to make room for the projected 36,000 new inmates in the
coming year. The numbers represented an almost 100 percent criminal
population turnover.
   The catch was that only so-called ``non-violent'' inmates _
serving time for passing bad checks, theft, credit-card abuse, drug
possession and burglary _ would be eligible for early release under
the plan.
   Parole officials have been predicting in recent months that the
pool of eligible inmates in those categories soon would dry up, a
situation that would force Gov. Bill Clements to invoke a state law
that allows an award of good-conduct credit to inmates.
   Parole board member Chris Mealy said the quota system may be on
the verge of running its course. Mealy said he will push a plan
next week in which parole officials could contract private concerns
for vacant space to house parole violators.

<HEAD>Biochemical Basis For Baldness Found, Miami Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida researcher said Friday that baldness
is caused by a biochemical change in cells that stop hair growth,
but it will be five to 10 years before a possible cure is ready for
testing.
   Dr. Marty E. Sawaya, a researcher at the University of Miami
School of Medicine, said she and colleagues have determined that
hair follicles that cease growing hair have a high ratio of a
single-molecule protein that is able to carrying the male hormone
testosterone into the cell nucleus and ``short circuit'' hair
growth.
   Ms. Sawaya told a news conference at a meeting of the Society
for Investigative Dermatology that the discovery was made after she
was able to separate out cells from scalp plugs from men at
different stages of hair loss.
   The physician said cells vigorously growing hair contain a high
ratio of a protein she called a tetramer, which has four molecules
closely bound together.
   But in scalp cells growing hair weakly or not at all, she said,
the tetramer ratio is very low and a type of protein she called a
monomer, or a single molecule of protein, was dominant.
   Ms. Sawaya said it appears the monomer is able to penetrate the
nucleus of the hair cell and affect the genetic pattern of the cell
that directs the growth of hair. The tetramer protein, however, is
unable to enter the cell nucleus.
   Also, she said, the monomer is four times more able to bind with
testosterone than is the tetramer.
   In other studies, a Miami research team was able to isolate an
inhibitor protein that tends to block binding of the male hormone
and the monomer, Ms. Sawaya said. This binding is thought to be an
important step in the process that leads to a halt in hair growth.
   Ms. Sawaya said she now is attempting to purify and eventually
synthesize this inhibitor protein. This protein possibly could be
administered to men who are starting to go bald and thereby stop
the process, she said.
   ``I would hope we could have something like that in the next
five to 10 years,'' she said. ``There'll be nothing any sooner than
that.''
   Ms. Sawaya said her research group has found a way to change the
protein ratios in the cells and that this technology might
eventually be applied to assist in the permanent removal of
unwanted hair, such as on the face of a woman.
   Dr. Vera Price, a clinical professor at the University of
California, San Francisco, praised the work by Ms. Sawaya as
``tremendously interesting. She has carried it (explanation of
baldness) a little bit further. It is an important next step.''
   Ms. Price said the research clearly shows how the balance of
protein types changes in hair follicles as they become
progressively shorter.
   Normal, hair-growing follicles are long and filled with a thick
hair shaft. But follicles become progressively shorter and the hair
shaft thinner as the protein ratio shifts.
   Dr. David A. Norris, a dermatology researcher at the University
of Colorado in Denver, said Ms. Sawaya's work has been examined by
a peer review group and found to be ``well founded.''
   ``It is an important extension of our understanding of the local
effects that cause male pattern baldness,'' he said.
   About 70 percent of all men over age 60 experience some form of
male pattern baldness, and for many the hair loss starts in the 20s
and 30s. Hair loss is also a problem with 10 percent to 15 percent
of the adult female population.
   The Society of Investigative Dermatology is a 50-year-old
organization of scientists specializing in rersearch of skin
disorders.

   Actor James Garner was discharged from
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Friday, eight days after undergoing
coronary bypass surgery, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``The surgery went very smoothly, his recovery has been
outstanding and he was released at 9:30 a.m.,'' said spokesman Ron
Wise.
   Garner, 60, the Emmy-winning star of the old television series
``The Rockford Files'' and ``Maverick,'' underwent five hours of
surgery April 21.
   Garner entered the hospital for tests April 18. Doctors had
planned to perform surgery for an aneurysm on his aorta, the main
artery carrying blood from the heart. But after reviewing test
results, doctors recommended the quintuple bypass operation first.
Surgery for the aneurysm will be scheduled later, hospital
officials said.
   Garner has blamed his heart problems on cigarettes.
   People magazine once called the ruggedly handsome Garner ``the
last real man'' in America, and he is a spokesman for the beef
industry's $30 million ``Beef, Real Food for Real People''
advertising campaign.

   Senate Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd said
today he had tentatively decided to open debate May 11 on a
U.S.-Soviet treaty to ban medium-range nuclear missiles, but only
if the two superpowers could clear up differences on verification
and other issues.
   The State Department, meanwhile, urged the Senate ``to move
forward expeditiously'' and said the treaty's anti-cheating
provisions were effective.
   Charles E. Redman, the department spokesman, said the Soviets
had taken a ``restrictive'' view of the right of U.S. monitors to
inspect containers for missile components as well as access to
Soviet facilities.
   He said the State Department had raised the issue with the
Soviets at a senior diplomatic level and was waiting for a reply.
``So we will see what we get,'' Redman said.
   The State Department official called the Soviet interpretation
of the verification procedures unacceptable.
   Byrd made clear that debate would not begin on May 11 _ less
than three weeks before President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev meet in Moscow _ if areas of concern were still
unresolved.
   Reagan administration officials are urging the legislators to
approve the pact before the May 29-June 2 summit to enhance
prospects for the two nations agreeing to other weapons restraints.
   The majority leader said he is especially concerned by published
reports quoting ranking Soviet military leaders as appearing to be
back away from mutual understandings on what would be permitted
under treaty provisions allowing on-site verification inspection. s
Byrd called on both Washington and Moscow to quickly deal with that
question as well as others, including a treaty ambiguity on what
constitutes a weapons delivery system and whether or not such
``Star Wars'' weapons as those using laser beams or particle ray
generatiors are covered by the pact.
   Earlier, a U.S. arms control official said the embassy in Moscow
has been in touch with Soviet officials to resolve the differences
they raised on how to verify compliance with the treaty.
   ``We anticipate that it'll be cleared up,'' the official of the
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said Thursday, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``We don't think this will be a big
problem.''
   Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a closed
session this week, voted sharp cuts in the budgets for intelligence
agencies because of irritation at the administration's failure to
seek improved surveillance systems for use in verifying the treaty,
the New York Times reported today.
   Committee chairman Sen. David L. Boren, D-Okla., said in an
interview that he is prepared to filibuster the treaty unless the
White House requests the money the intelligence panel believes is
needed for monitoring, the Times reported.

   Panamanian exiles on Friday blasted a
U.S.-sponsored deal that would allow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
resign as defense chief, calling the change purely cosmetic and one
that could create an anti-American backlash.
   The U.S. attorney's office, meanwhile, said drug indictments
against the Panamanian strongman remain in force.
   In Washington, sources reported Friday that Noriega had agreed
to step down from his powerful post as head of Panama's military,
but would not leave his country immediately as U.S. officials had
initially demanded.
   The reports did not say whether dismissing Noriega's
cocaine-trafficking charges in Miami and Tampa was part of the
deal, but such offers have reportedly been made in the past.
   ``This sounds like a surrender with cosmetics,'' said Roberto
Eisenmann, exiled publisher of the closed independent newspaper La
Prensa. ``This is the same mistake all over again _ the United
States intervening in Panama, ignoring totally the political forces
of the country.''
   Gilberto Mallol, exile representative here of the Panamanian
opposition umbrella group, the Civic Crusade, agreed.
   ``This cosmetic solution will only take the country down the
road to disaster,'' said Mallol. ``The Reagan administration has no
right to decide Noriega can remain in Panama.''
   Mallol disputed U.S. contentions that Noriega will be out of
power as soon as he is out of uniform. ``Obviously, this deal shows
Noriega is making conditions. He will continue to interfere and
continue the militarization of Panama.''
   Mallol warned that the deal could backfire on the United States,
causing a wave of anti-American sentiment among Noriega opponents.
   Eisenmann said the opposition will not let up because of the
deal, noting the latest outbreak of anti-Noriega demonstrations
Thursday. Hundreds of people demonstrated in Panama City, burning
barricades and chanting against the military leader.
   Both Mallol and Eisenmann agreed that Noriega should remain in
Panama only if he agrees to submit to Panamanian justice.
   They also said the nation must move toward a true democracy and
break the Panamanian Defense Force's stranglehold on power.
   ``The problem isn't Noriega,'' said Mallol, ``It's the military.
If the militarization of Panama is not ended, what looks like a
short-term solution will lose Panama in the long term.''
   Meanwhile, the U.S. attorney's office in Miami said it had not
been notified of any change in the status of Noriega's indictment,
which accuses him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from the
Medellin Cartel to protect its cocaine-smuggling operations in
Panama. He is also under indictment in Tampa on separate drug
charges.
   ``The only two people who can dismiss an indictment are the
Attorney General of the United States or the U.S. Attorney for the
district in which the indictment was brought,'' said Richard
Gregorie, chief assistant U.S. attorney and lead prosecutor in the
case. ``As far as we are concerned, no dismissal has been entered
here.''

   The apparent arrest of an underground Christian
preacher comes during a time of unusual tolerance by the Communist
government toward China's illegal ``house churches.''
   Another underground minister in Beijing said authorities
recently have not stopped him and other preachers from holding
weekly services in their homes for dozens and even hundreds of
people even though they violate China's ban on preaching outside
state-sanctioned churches.
   The minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity, painted a
picture of an underground movement toughened by past harsh
repression and confident it can survive any setbacks.
   ``I was in prison more than 20 years _ I'm experienced,'' the
74-year-old minister said grinning broadly. ``If I am arrested
again and die for the Lord it is glorious.''
   He and Xu Yongzhe, who disappeared April 16 and is believed to
have been arrested, are among thousands of Protestant ministers and
Catholic priests and nuns who refuse to join the official churches.
Instead, they preach at home.
   About 8 million people belong to the official Protestant and
Catholic churches in China, and nearly as many are believed to
belong to the house churches.
   The believers make up a tiny fraction of China's more than 1
billion people.
   Although some house church preachers and members remain in
prisons and labor camps _ the minister said there were 500 in
custody _ the government is more tolerant of their activities than
ever before in nearly four decades of Communist rule.
   The minister said authorities have not bothered him even though
he remains under probation after being freed from jail in 1979, and
holds two services each Sunday. Forty people crowd into his
one-room home _ something impossible to hide from neighbors in
Beijing's tightly packed residential areas.
   Xu's arrest, however, was no surprise. He had been a fugitive
since 1982, when he escaped from a jail in Henan in central China,
hopped on a bicycle and peddled into hiding. He ran an underground
seminary but was not especially prominent among house church
preachers, his fellow minister said.
   Xu, believed to be about 50, had been in jail only a few months
charged with illegal proselytizing. The other minister said he did
not know Xu's sentence.
   He said he'd been expecting Xu to visit the day he disappeared.
   Instead, Xu's sister came alone and reported that Xu disappeared
while visiting the Beijing Zoo with two friends, the second day
after he left his hiding place in northern China to hear visiting
American evangelist Billy Graham preach in Beijing.
   He said Xu's sister received no confirmation from authorities
that he had been arrested, but it appeared certain. The Ministry of
State Security refused to answer queries about Xu.
   Graham said Friday in Hong Kong at the end of his 16-day Chinese
tour that he asked high-level Chinese officials about the reported
arrest but received neither confirmation nor denial.
   The renowned Southern Baptist minister said he prayed for Xu and
told Chinese officials his reaction to the report, but could not
otherwise intervene.
   ``Our hope is from the Lord, not from Billy Graham,'' Xu's
colleague said.
   The minister said he studied theology under Western missionaries
in the 1930s, but Xu and younger house preachers learned through
self-study and informal training by house church preachers. Funds
and thousands of Bibles are smuggled in each year from religious
groups outside China.
   The minister said the house churches have no central
organization and do not oppose the government.
   ``We have no time to mess with the things of the world,'' he
said.
   ``I believe politics and religion should be separate. The
(official) churches have become a tool of the government. They
preach to ... serve the modernization policy.''
   Indeed, China's Catholic church does not recognize the Vatican.
   During the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution all churches
were closed and religious activity was banned.
   Although some churches have been reopened since Deng Xiaoping
came to power in 1978, ministers and priests are closely
circumscribed. They cannot give religious instruction to anyone
under 18, and must support government campaigns.
   Preaching on themes such as diligence, honesty and respect for
parents is considered to have social value. But the Christian
belief that Jesus Christ will come again at the end of the world is
discouraged as likely to undermine hard work.
   ``We are free _ but only inside the circle,'' the minister said,
running a finger around the rim of a rice bowl in illustration.

   The Marine Corps today declared two officers
missing from last week's fighting in the Persian Gulf ``killed in
action'' and disclosed that they reported a hostile radar had
locked on their helicopter gunship before it disappeared.
   The corps, in a statement, refused to say the AH-1T Cobra
gunship flown by Capt. Stephen C. Leslie and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill
had definitely been shot down by Iranian forces, as Iran has
claimed.
   But the statement said: ``After reviewing the circumstances, (a
Marine) fact-finding body determined the disappearance was a direct
result of hostile action, sustained in combat or relating thereto.
   ``In making its recommendation, the fact-finding body provided
the following explanation: `While being vectored to identify an
unknown surface contact, Captains Hill and Leslie reported a fire
control radar lock-on. The USS Wainwright lost communication and
radar contact with Captains Hill and Leslie.'''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people gathered for a
march through downtown Panama City today to support strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega after reports that he had agreed to resign
as defense chief.
   Many government offices closed at midmorning, and employees were
told to join the march called by the Front for Popular Unity.
   A U.S. official in Washington said that under an agreement with
the Reagan administration, Noriega would stay in Panama after
resigning. Initially, the United States had insisted that he leave
the country.
   ``It is they (the United States) that are now seeking a
face-saving maneuver,'' said a Panamanian government official who
spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Michael Kozak, an aide to Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams, met with Noriega this week and was back in Washington
today, the U.S. official said.
   There was no official comment here on the reported talks.
Panamanian government officials have not confirmed that they were
being held.
   As commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, Noriega has
been the power behind the civilian government.
   But the U.S. official said that Noriega, once he steps down,
would be like a ``cop out of uniform'' and would cease to be the
dominant political force in Panama.
   The government official said he saw nothing new in the
Washington reports.
   On Thursday, security agents arrested at least 30 people in a
crackdown on Noriega opponents, and authorities issued arrest
warrants for opposition leaders.
   Riot police and plainclothes officers fired birdshot into the
air from 12-gauge shotguns and lobbed tear gas canisters to
disperse small groups of protesters in Panama City.
   Hundreds of demonstrators set up burning barricades and taunted
police and riot troops, who patrolled in trucks.
   The protesters chanted, ``Get Out, Noriega!'' ``Justice!'' and,
in a derogatory reference to Noriega's pockmarked face, ``Down With
Pineapple Face!''
   Journalists saw police arrest several people in the city of
David near the Costa Rican border. A church source in David said at
least two people were wounded when demonstrators began throwing
rocks at police.
   Police refused to comment on the reports.
   Before the demonstrations, Attorney General Carlos A. Villalaz
told a news conference that the 30 people arrested were planning a
three-day campaign of violence which he said may have included
tampering with two Panama Canal locks.
   Villalaz said arrest warrants had been issued for 35 directors
of the National Civic Crusade, an umbrella organization of civic
and professional groups that has organized anti-Noriega protests
since June.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater signaled a shift in U.S.
policy Thursday when he said the administration, while not
insisting that Noriega leave Panama, wants him at least to ``leave
power.''
   The Washington Post today quoted a source as saying Noriega
would leave after a ``face-saving'' transition and was known to
favor the Dominican Republic.
   The agreement also provides that Noriega would not be
extradicted to the United States, according to the Post. Noriega is
under U.S. indictment on drug charges.
   Reagan administration officials reportedly have been seeking
more subtle ways to get Noriega to step down after failing to
dislodge the general with the economic sanctions, which have
created a severe cash shortage in Panama.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma told a gathering of
international labor organizers Thursday that Panama will continue
to resist U.S. pressure to oust Noriega.
   Noriega won a legal battle Thursday when a federal judge in
Miami ruled he could challenge one of two drug-trafficking
indictments without surrendering to U.S. authorities.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler gave the general's
attorney, Neal Sonnett, 10 days to submit challenges to the Feb. 4
indictment and said he would set a hearing date after the
government responded.

   Jesse Jackson stepped up his attack on
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis Friday, accusing him of
being either ignorant or wrong about issues involving southern
Africa.
   Specifically, Jackson complained that Dukakis had expressed
opposition to providing weapons to Mozambique's Marxist-led
government for use against a rebel movement that is brutalizing the
country.
   Dukakis, he said, ``either has a lack of understanding about the
options in the region or he supports a policy that's inconsistent
with the progressive and democratic thrust in the world.''
   Jackson made the comments to reporters following a speech to
about 2,500 students at Euclid High School, where he received a
cordial reception but one that was less enthusiastic than he
usually gets at schools.
   He portrayed Dukakis as being to the right of President Reagan
on Mozambique, stating that even conservative British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher sends arms to Mozambique. He said Reagan
wanted to do so also but was thwarted by congressional
conservatives.
   Throughout the campaign, Jackson has made attempts to bring
southern Africa into the campaign debate, and he has been making a
renewed and more intense push to do so as Dukakis' lead in the
delegate race has widened.
   In the face of the growing likelihood that Dukakis will be the
Democratic nominee, Jackson says he wants to delineate the
distinctions between himself and the Massachusetts governor, while
also trying to focus attention on issues he considers important.
   The approach is in contrast to the posture Jackson maintained
through most of the campaign in which he avoided singling out
Democratic opponents for criticism.
   Campaigning Friday in search of votes for Tuesday's Ohio
primary, Jackson also repeated his charge that Dukakis has no plan
to reverse Reagan administration economic policies, but wants only
``to manage Reaganomics.''
   He said Dukakis' stance on Mozambique ``exposes a lack of
understanding of foreign policy. ... The front line states (around
South Africa) need to be able to defend themselves from South
Africa.''
   South Africa denies it supports the Mozambican rebel group,
known as Renamo, but the State Department has said there is
evidence to the contrary.
   Jackson in recent days has called on Vice President George Bush,
the likely Republican presidential nominee, and Dukakis to join him
in calling for South Africa to be treated as a terrorist state
because of its support for Renamo.
   ``It does not take much to class South Africa to be a terrorist
state,'' he said. ``If one does, however, you must then trigger
anti-terrorist policies. We must then put on full trade and arms
embargoes against South Africa and engage our allies with whom we
trade arms'' and insist they not sell arms to South Africa.
   On Friday Jackson also addressed an outdoor rally under chilly,
gray skies in downtown Cleveland. A few hundred people braved the
wind and cold to attend.
   At the predominantly white Euclid High School, Jackson's usual
crowd-rousing ``I am somebody'' chant drew halfhearted audience
participation.
   When the crowd weakly repeated the words after him, the
candidate joked, ``You're all so pitiful.''
   Eventually he warmed them up by shouting, ``Euclid _ No. one!''
But afterward, student Maren Lueersen, 17, said she felt his
presentation was ``too much like church,'' with the students being
asked to recite chants and stand when he asked how many people knew
someone who was killed or jailed because of drugs.

   It's a boy, girl, girl, girl and girl for Max
and Terry Simunich.
   The first-time parents said Friday they're ``five times happy''
with their quintuplets, born three months prematurely earlier this
week.
   ``I think it's wonderful. You get a whole family at once,'' Mrs.
Simunich, 26, said from a wheelchair after visiting her babies in
the neonatal intensive care unit of Magee-Womens Hospital. ``I
don't want to do this again, but it's worth it.''
   Mrs. Simunich, a registered nurse, learned she was expecting
quintuplets about a month after she became pregnant last fall after
taking a fertility drug. Even so, she and her husband are still not
over the shock.
   ``You have to deal with this. This is what you have. This is
what God has given you,'' said Simunich, 28, a buyer for a
wholesale grocery company.
   The babies were delivered by Caesarean section during a
five-minute span beginning just before midnight Wednesday.
   Bradley Andrew came first, followed by Emily Marie. After
midnight, Allison Nicole, Rachel Lauren and Kathryn Elizabeth were
born, giving them a birthday a day after their older siblings. The
babies ranged from 1 pound, 8 ounces, to 1 pound, 10 ounces.
   They were listed in critical but stable condition Friday.
   ``We do feel they have a reasonable chance and at this point are
optimistic,'' said Dr. Robert D. Guthrie, the hospital's chief of
pediatrics. The next week will be the most crucial, he said.
   Quintuplets occur naturally once per 6 million to 7 million
births, according to the hospital, but use of a fertility drug ups
those odds. The only other set of quintuplets born at Magee-Womens
Hospital, in 1966, all died within days of birth.
   During the pregnancy, the Simuniches didn't go on a buying spree
or make major changes at their four-bedroom home in Greenville, a
small community in northwestern Pennsylvania.
   ``We've tried as much as possible to keep a normal attitude
about the things that we do from day to day,'' Simunich said. ``We
don't have a choice, and to worry about it just causes more
anxiety.''
   Mrs. Simunich was hospitalized about a month ago as a precaution
and went into labor several times but was given a drug that stopped
it. Wednesday night, doctors decided they could wait no longer, and
a 33-member medical team delivered the babies by Caesarean section.
   The quintuplets are expected to remain in the hospital until
late July.
   Mrs. Simunich said her career plans are up in the air but she
hopes eventually to return to nursing part-time. In the meantime,
she's going to go home and wait for the babies to join her.
   ``I'm going to sit on my deck and have a drink,'' she said,
laughing.

Report</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new defense secretary, Frank Carlucci, on
Friday put his own moderate stamp on the Pentagon's annnual review
``Soviet Military Power.''
   The book has generated a host of critics and at least two
imitations since then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger issued
the first edition in 1981, at the outset of the Reagan
administration's $1 trillion defense buildup.
   The Soviet Union has its own version, ``Whence the Threat to
Peace.'' And Tom Gervasi, a critic of the U.S. military, this
spring published what he calls ``an annotated and corrected''
version of ``the Pentagon's propaganda document.''
   Now austerity has put a crimp in the Pentagon budget, and time
and Carlucci have removed some of the book's more jagged edges.
   Early editions of ``Soviet Military Power'' drew criticism from
many analysts on Capitol Hill and outside government because of
alleged innaccuracies and failure to compare overall capabilities
of the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The 1988 edition released at a news conference on Friday, the
first since Carlucci became replaced Weinberger as defense
secretary last Nov. 5, addresses those criticisms by including more
comparative text and graphs. It also acknowledges that the West
leads in such areas as naval power and high technology.
   The book has shed the warlike red cover of previous years in
favor of calmer gray background and a photograph of Kremlin leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the deck of a Soviet Typhoon nuclear
ballistic missile submarine.
   Also, the publication devotes most of its first 30 pages to
Gorbachev's overall national security policy before turning to
military spending and hardware.
   ``You'll note we have taken a somewhat different approach this
year than in previous years,'' Carlucci told reporters.
   ``During my testimony (before Congress) earlier this year, I
received a number of requests for an assessment of how Soviet
military capabilities relate to our national interests, our
military capabilities and those of our allies,'' he said.
   ``Furthermore, I believe it is especially important to share
with the public as comprehensive a view of the trends and
implications of Soviet military power as possible. And so this year
the scope of the book has been expanded ...'' said Carlucci. ``We
welcome criticism.''
   The latest 175-page volume is nearly double the 99 pages of the
first edition, and for the first time contains an index to weapons
and photographs.
   In 1981 Weinberger, in a presentation beamed by satellite to
Europe, issued the first edition together with a declaration that
the Soviet Union was stronger militarily than the United States.
   Weinberger billed the book as a compendium of ``scrubbed''
intelligence reports on Soviet defense, but analysts outside
government called it a rehash of information already available
publicly.
   It contained colorful maps, charts, photographs and artists'
renditions of Soviet weaponry. The Pentagon published a
Russian-language version, which diplomats in Moscow circulated
among Soviet contacts.
   The Kremlin was not pleased.
   The Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda published a lengthy
front-page editorial describing the Pentagon book as a ``big lie''
designed for ``simpletons.''
   ``It is to be hoped that the foreign public will be able to
judge the worth of the latest rotten fruit of Pentagon
propaganda,'' Pravda said on Oct. 17, 1981.
   A few years later, the Kremlin weighed in with its own effort,
``Whence the Threat to Peace,'' drawing largely on Western
publications to back Soviet claims that Washington was the chief
instigator of the arms race.
   In his version issued this spring, U.S. author Gervasi was no
less harsh than the Kremlin.
   Gervasi wrote that in editions as recent as last year, ``even
the most basic facts are distorted'' as part of Reagan
administration efforts to prove that the United States is on the
losing end of a military gap.
   Gervasi's version includes the 1987 edition of the Pentagon
book, overlaid with his own commentaries, in large part corrections
of the range and capabilities of Soviet and American weaponry.
   ``In almost every case, the Americans have taken the lowest
estimate for U.S. capabilities and the highest for the Soviets,''
Gervasi said in his book and in a telephone interview.
   Military expert David Isby says that Gervasi, too, plays with
the numbers.
   Gervasi, he said, ``believes that the Soviet Union, no matter
what its flaws, is never as bad as the United States. He looks for
any figure that shows a Soviet weapon to be less capable.''

<HEAD>Dukakis' Plant Closing Law Doesn't Apply in Possible Cullinet
Layoff</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>By JOHN DIAMOND</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts-based company reported to be
planning major layoffs has failed to notify the state at a time
when Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis has been
touting a state law on the subject.
   A state official says the law wouldn't apply in the case.
   Dukakis wants President Reagan to sign a federal trade bill that
requires companies to warn workers 60 days before a major layoff or
plant shutdown. He has emphasized that Massachusetts was one of the
first states to impose its own plant-closing law.
   The issue has been of particular importance to the Massachusetts
governor as he campaigns in industrial sections of Ohio and
Indiana, which have primaries Tuesday.
   Dukakis administration officials said it was only this week that
they saw press reports that Cullinet Software Inc. planned to lay
off 400 of its 2,400 workers Monday and that half the layoffs would
occur at the company's Westwood, Mass., plant.
   Cullinet spokeswoman Frances Wheeler termed reports of the
layoffs ``rumors.'' She said she was familiar with the state
plant-closing law, but ``we don't have any set, bound company
policy about notifying.''
   ``Of course we would always prefer advance warning,'' said Rick
Gureghian, spokesman for Dukakis' Executive Office of Economic and
Manpower Affairs.
   However, unlike the federal proposal, the Massachusetts law
requests but does not require companies to provide advance warning
of plant closings. Dukakis defends it as effective and says there
are sanctions to make companies comply. ``In many ways,'' he said
of the state's law, ``it goes beyond this (federal proposal) and in
other ways it doesn't.''
   Gureghian said the state defines a plant closing as laying off
90 percent of the work force at a plant. A ``partial closing,''
Gureghian said, is ``a permanent cessation of a major, discreet
portion'' of a company or division.
   The reported plans for Cullinet layoffs would not apply to
either definition, he said.

<TEXT>
   The biggest burger maker in the free world wants
to find out if it can cut the mustard in Moscow, but only after it
goes Hungary.
   McDonald's announced Friday it will open the first of a string
of eateries in downtown Moscow next year.
   It may not mean golden arches in Red Square, but it will mean
Muscovites can munch fries, slurp shakes and gobble ``Big Maks''
just like their Western counterparts, courtesy of McGlasnost.
   ``I think the McDonald's in Moscow will be the highest volume
McDonald's in the world,'' predicted George A. Cohon, president of
McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd., after signing a joint pact
with the Moscow city government.
   Meanwhile, the first McDonald's in a Soviet bloc country opens
its doors Saturday in Hungary. The Budapest burger emporium was
dedicated on Friday.
   Last month, McDonald's opened a restaurant in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, its first in a communist nation. Impatient customers
waiting in line on opening day became so unruly that police were
called.
   Although five more restaurants are planned for Belgrade, Moscow
could be the big enchilada for McDonald's, which had worldwide
sales of $14.3 billion last year.
   Cohon and Vladimir I. Malishkov, chief of food services for the
Soviet capital, signed an agreement for the creation of up to 20
fast-food eateries in Moscow and the building of a commissary to
process beef, potatoes and other foods McDonald's uses.
   ``A Big Mac, our world-famous sandwich, will taste the same in
Moscow as it does in Toronto, or Tokyo, or Rio, or New York,''
Cohon vowed at a news conference in Moscow's city hall.
   The agreement, which gives McDonald's of Canada a 49 percent
share in the Soviet-controled joint firm, is the latest business
venture concluded by the Soviets with a foreign company, and th
first with a Canadian firm.
   Last year, the Kremlin enacted a new law on joint ventures in a
bid to woo capital, technology and expertise from abroad. The
reform is part of changes enacted under Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev designed to improve the quality and quantity of consumer
goods.
   Pepsico Inc. last September signed a contract to open two Pizza
Hut restaurants in Moscow in a joint venture. A New Jersey company
called AstroPizza brought a van into the capital this month to
serve pizza to Soviets and foreigners, and plans to open a joint
venture restaurant in Moscow later this year.
   Malishkov and Moscow Deputy Mayor Valery A. Zharov said the
Soviets want to draw upon the expertise of the U.S.-based
McDonald's to improve service in their country's food industry.
   And the Moscow restaurants are only the beginning.
   ``We're not thinking of just opening 20 McDonald's in this
country,'' Cohon said. ``There will be many more.''
   Soviets will be able to buy a Big Mac, the chain's double-patty
hamburger sandwich, for about 2 rubles, or roughly $3.
   The first McDonald's in the Soviet capital is expected to open
on Gorky Street next year, Cohon said. But nobody will say where.
   ``We don't want to create any lines,'' Zharov said with a smile.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of employees struck for higher
pay at a heavy machinery plant Friday, capping a week of Poland's
worst labor trouble since the Communist authorities suppressed
Solidarity more than six years ago.
   Warsaw police detained Jacek Kuron, a senior adviser to the
outlawed union. A member of his household said three
plainclothesmen arrived as Kuron was being interviewed by telephone
by a Western radio station.
   Strikes began Monday with bus and streetcar drivers at Bydgoszcz
in the west. Workers at the huge Lenin steel works at Nowa Huta in
the southern industrial belt followed suit Tuesday, and on Friday
it was the machinery plant at Stalowa Wola, about 65 miles east of
Nowa Huta.
   Another job action was threatened for over the May Day holiday
weekend. Solidarity activists in Krakow's municipal transport
company said in a statement they were calling a strike for 6 a.m.
Saturday to support the Nowa Huta workers.
   Workers demand pay increases of 50 percent or more. Prices rose
42 percent in the first three months of 1988 because the government
reduced subsidies on many consumer items.
   The government has both threatened dismissals and promised to
improve wages. At Bydgoszcz, the 2,800 drivers won a 60 percent pay
increase with an 11-hour strike.
   Officials of Solidarity threatened more strikes if authorities
use force against strikers. They said workers in at least four
other cities had declared support for the Nowa Huta action and
issued strike alerts.
   In West Germany, the newspaper Bild quoted Solidarity founder
Lech Walesa as saying in an interview the strike ``has to spread
because the economic situation is bad. We really didn't want to
strike because strikes have never filled a bread basket, but the
government leaves us no choice but to fight for our rights.''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said an attempt to start a
strike failed at the 18,000-worker Stalowa Wola heavy machinery
plant, but the official news agency PAP said later at least one
department was shut down.
   A Roman Catholic priest in Stalowa Wola, the Rev. Jan Niemiec,
said about 7,000 strikers were occupying three department and the
strike began when about 5,000 first-shift employees quit working.
He said management tried to lock out most of the second-shift
workers but some broke in.
   Niemiec said the number of strikers could be as high as 9,000,
but he could not confirm the figure. He said the information came
from a member of the strike committee.
   In Poland, strikers customarily go to their places of employment
but do not work. Often they hold meetings or pass out leaflets.
   About 12,000 workers were striking for a fourth day at the Lenin
plant in Nowa Huta, which means New Steel Mill and was built as a
model city in the 1950s just outside Krakow.
   Management representatives met with the plant's
government-sanctioned union but refused to deal with the unofficial
committee that claims to represent at least half the plant's 32,000
workers.
   The Nowa Huta strike is the biggfest in Poland since those that
swept the country after food price increases in 1980, bringing down
a government and giving birth to Solidarity. The independent union
federation was suppressed, then outlawed, after martial law was
declared in December 1981.
   Urban said there had been ``preventative detentions'' in Poland
this week, but did not say how many. Kuron, the Solidarity adviser,
said by telephone before his detention that 25 people had been
picked up around the country in the past two days.
   Bronislaw Geremek, an adviser to Walesa, said police stopped his
car Thursday in Stalowa Wola and detained him, Solidarity spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz and Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak. He
said Onyszkiewicz and Bujak remained in custody.
   Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Solidarity spokesman in Warsaw, said
many police were in Stalowa Wola and at least four Solidarity
activists were detained.
   Demands at Nowa Huta are representative: recognition of their
union rights, release of detained Solidarity activists and an
immediate 50 percent increase in monthly pay that averages the
equivalent of $105.
   The strike committee said it had sent a letter to Pope John Paul
II, who was Krakow's archbishop before becoming pope, that began:
``We address you with our words of devotion and respect. We are
sending those words from the place of our work and struggle for
decent payment.''
   Urban told a news conference in Warsaw: ``The situation in
Poland is not dramatic, with only one strike in Nowa Huta and an
attempt to organize a strike that failed in Stalowa Wola.''
   He said the Nowa Huta management had decided to fire striking
workers.
   Labor Minister Ireneneusz Sekula said the government would
announce tax law changes and other measures in a few days allowing
enterprises to grant higher pay. He said he could not be more
specific.
   Trybuna Ludu, the Communist Party newspaper, attacked ``Mr.
Walesa and company ... who are trying to use the uneasy situation
for their own political goals.''
   It said demands for higher wages were ``calls for anarchy, to
start unrestrained inflation, to create a situation in which we
would once again have empty store shelves and the creditors would
lose their growing confidence in us.''

<HEAD>Unpaid Parking Fines Down Sharply After Britain Gets Tough</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new government policy that threatens to turn
diplomats' unpaid parking tickets into airplane tickets expelling
them from Britain has foreign envoys rushing to pay their fines.
   The Foreign Office said Friday that 18,000-member diplomatic
community ran up only 14,437 unpaid fines last year, compared with
108,845 in 1984.
   Foreign Office Minister Timothy Eggar told Parliament in a
written statement that the number was down 35 percent from 1986.
   Diplomats, under international conventions, are immune from
prosecution for offenses committed in the host country, but the
host can have the offender expelled.
   The Foreign Office says that in 1985 it began issuing expulsion
threats against repeat parking offenders, but has not yet ordered
anyone out. It said it sent out a dozen such warnings last year.
   Many diplomats complain they have to park illegally because
their missions are in the congested heart of London.
   Egypt, with 799 unpaid fines, topped Eggar's list.
   Rounding out the top five were the Soviet Union with 622, China
with 551, France with 513 and Spain with 435.
   The United Nations and 10 countries had no fines unpaid last
year: Angola, Australia, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Malta,
New Zealand, Switzerland, Tonga and the Vatican.
   The U.S. Embassy had 77 unpaid fines, only 17 of them in the
second half of the year. Canada had 130, including 36 in the second
half.
   ``We decided in 1985 that we were going to take a very tough
line and insist that diplomats paid their fines,'' Eggar told a
reporter.
   ``We can't force them to pay,'' he said, ``but we regard it as
an abuse of diplomatic immunity, and we make it quite clear that,
if they are persistent offenders and they don't pay, they can't
stay in the United Kingdom.''
   The Foreign Office has no figures for fines paid, but Eggar
said: ``Up to 1984, the number of unpaid fines was rising
dramatically. It is now falling even more dramatically.''
   He said he would thank missions which pay their fines, and
demand improvements from those that don't. He added he was
confident that all British diplomats abroad paid their fines.
   In New York, Philip Goldberg of the city's Commission for the
United Nations and the Consular Corps said British diplomats do
have outstanding, unpaid parking tickets and, like most nations'
diplomats, generally do not pay them.
   But, he added, British diplomats get relatively few tickets.
   ``They have one of the best records for violations per
vehicle,'' he said.
   In another Commons reply, Eggar reported 43 alleged ``serious
offenses'' by foreign diplomats in 1987, resulting in 18 diplomats
being ousted.
   The offenses included 26 cases of drunken driving, 13 of theft
and shoplifting, and one each of forgery, driving without
insurance, possession of drugs and indecent assault.

<HEAD>Judge Moves To Free Multiple Personality Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Friday that a man found
innocent by reason of insanity on rape charges because he had
multiple personalities is now well, apparently clearing the way for
his release.
   William Milligan has been confined in various mental
institutions around the state for much of the time since the
original ruling in 1977.
   Judge C. Howard Johnson said psychiatric and psychological
reports show Milligan's multiple personalities have fused, and that
he is well.
   Milligan, who was charged with rape and abduction in three
attacks in the Columbus area, once had more than 20 personalities,
according to the book ``The Minds of Billy Milligan.''
   As a result of the judge's ruling, Milligan was transferred from
the maximum security section of the Timothy Moritz Forensics Center
here to the Central Ohio Psychiatric Hospital.
   Milligan had been confined at the Moritz center since he was
captured in December 1986 after escaping from the Central Ohio
Psychiatric Hospital on July 4, 1986.
   Officials say it will take about a month to place him in private
housing and help him try to find a job.
   During his court appearance Friday, Milligan pledged to obey the
law and said he wants to be a tax-paying citizen. He said he wants
to continue his work as an artist, or find a job involving
computers.
   Milligan still must undergo therapy twice a week for the next
year, according to the judge's ruling.
   Milligan also was charged in a November 1984 shooting at a barn
on property owned by a worker at a mental health facility where he
was a patient.
   No one was injured in the shooting, and the case was dismissed
after defense attorneys claimed that Milligan's constitutional
rights were violated when a jailer recorded his side of a phone
conversation with his attorney.

   Delegates committed to Albert Gore Jr. and
Paul Simon are beginning to defect to Democratic front-runner
Michael Dukakis, whose presidential campaign is gently pursuing
them.
   ``We don't consider it raiding,'' said Susan Brophy, a delegate
tracker for Dukakis. ``We consider it a re-introduction.''
   ``It's definitely a soft sell,'' she said.
   Gore and Simon have both suspended their campaigns but have not
formally dropped out of the race. They hold a combined total of
just over 600 delegates.
   Tad Devine, director of field operations for Dukakis, said,
``We've seen some come in in the last few weeks and we expect to
rack up some more with another couple of wins, which has been the
case since New York and Pennsylvania.''
   The number of public converts to other campaigns is still small.
   One of them, Jack Burson, was among 23 delegates in Louisiana
pledged to support Gore based on the results of the state's March 8
presidential primary. But he has recently switched to Dukakis.
   ``Gore was my first choice, but as I see it, he's no longer in
the race and I had to choose between the people who are,'' Burson
said Friday.
   Burson is one of more than 3,500 ``pledged'' delegates to the
Democratic National Convention who were being picked because of
their support for a particular presidential candidate. Party rules
say those delegates ``shall in all good conscience reflect the
sentiments of those who elected them.''
   Party leaders say that means they are free to change their minds.
   Louisiana Democratic Chairman James Brady said Tennessee Sen.
Gore's decision to put his campaign on hold makes his delegates
``Gore delegates'' in name only. Brady said he's fielded questions
from a number of them since the campaign was suspended on April 21.
   ``The main question is: `Are we still going?''' Brady said. ``We
had a number of the Gore people who thought that since Gore was no
longer there that they may be bumped.''
   ``They will go to the convention as Gore delegates,'' Brady
said. ``They'll vote for somebody other than Gore; that's for
sure.''
   That's not how the Gore campaign prefers to see it.
   ``Our preference is at this point in time that the Gore
delegates remain Gore delegates,'' said Rick Hutcheson, Gore's
delegate tracker, who was not aware of Burson's defection. ``I
think there remains a great deal of affection and loyalty to Al and
that's what we're going to continue to see.''
   But David Carle, a spokesman for Simon, said the Illinois
senator expected that some of his delegates would go elsewhere when
his campaign was suspended on April 7.
   ``He made clear to his delegates and other supporters around the
country that he remained a candidate and intended to go to the
convention but also expressed understanding for any individual
decisions that his changed status prompted with his supporters and
delegates,'' Carle said.
   However, Carle said later that he was wrong about the Simon
campaign being resigned to losing delegates. He said the campaign
was staying in contact with the delegates by telephone and letter
to encourage them to stay with Simon.
   Simon is considering a meeting after June 7 to ``consult with
his delegates about what they would prefer to do at that point.''
Carle said.
   So far, Simon has lost one delegate to Dukakis _ Rep. Barbara
Boxer of California _ although she is one of the ``super
delegates,'' a special class reserved for party leaders and
politicians who are free to support whomever they please.
   Kathleen Vick, who chairs the Democrats' Rules Committee, said
two recent developments in the party have contributed to the
phenomenon of defecting delegates: the suspended campaign that is
neither active nor abandoned and a rules change.
   ``We've got a new fuzzy area of the law, as it were,'' Ms. Vick
said.
   Eight years ago, a Democratic delegate was bound to support his
candidate, no matter what, and the rules were changed specifically
to soften that, she said.
   ``I think the operative word here is `in all good conscience,'''
she said. ``In 1980 people were calling the delegates automatons.''

   Sikh militants holed up in the Golden
Temple attacked para-military troops on Friday and at least 24
people were killed in other parts of Punjab in separatist violence,
police and news reports said.
   The slayings raised to 862 the number of people killed this year
in attacks blamed on the radical movement for a Sikh homeland.
   At least six people were killed and 80 injured when five bombs
exploded on Friday afternoon in the crowded main market of Batala
town, the United News of India said. It said police clamped an
indefinite curfew on the town, 25 miles northeast of Amritsar,
after the explosions.
   At least two of the victims were reported to be militants. Three
people who were believed to have placed the explosives were
arrested, UNI said.
   Merchants around Amritsar's Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest
shrine, closed their shops when militants fired at a patrol of the
Central Reserve Police on Friday, said police superintendent Baldev
Singh.
   The attack started when the troops attempted to arrest a wanted
militant as he was heading for the shrine, Baldev Singh said. The
troops returned the fire but the militant escaped in the confusion.
   One woman was injured in the 20-minute firefight, he said. The
attack prompted authorities to place the city's police force on a
``red alert'' although security forces did not attempt to enter the
temple.
   Security forces have entered the temple previously but usually
avoid doing so because of Sikh sentiment. Police estimate that at
least 100 militants, armed with automatic rifles, are hiding in the
shrine.
   In other militant attacks Thursday night, at least seven Hindus
were shot and killed in two villages near Amritsar. Five Sikhs were
killed in a raid on a farmer's home, also near Amritsar.
   At least six other people, including four Sikhs and two
unidentified victims, were shot and killed in other attacks through
the state.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 800 million people but make up a
majority in Punjab. The militants have been agitating for an
independent homeland since 1983, claiming discrimination by the
Hindu majority.

<HEAD>Navy Opens Two More Ships to Female Sailors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy said Friday it had begun opening
additional sea-going combat support jobs to women, selecting a
group of 24 for deployment on two ships later this summer.
   ``Two women officers and 22 women enlisted personnel will report
for duty aboard the fleet oilers USS Cimarron, homeported in Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii, in August and USS Monongahela, homeported in
Norfolk, Va., in September,'' the Navy said in a statement.
   ``The two ships were selected because they require the least
modification to accommodate women.''
   The upcoming assignments are being made under a decision
announced last Dec. 21 by then-Navy Secretary James H. Webb
following a special internal study on the role of women in the Navy.
   Webb adopted what he described as the first clear, concise
definition of ``combat missions'' to help determine on which ships
women could serve. Unless a ship or aircraft has as its primary
objective the goal ``to seek out, reconnoiter and engage the
enemy,'' the jobs on that ship or aircraft should be open to women,
he said.
   That policy, when fully implemented, will almost triple the
number of sea-going jobs open to women _ to a new total of almost
15,000 _ by opening billets on so-called Combat Logistics Force
ships like the Cimarron and Monongahela.
   All told, 27 logistic ships are being opened to female sailors.
   ``Further assignments of women to CLF ships will continue at a
measured pace from December 1988 through July 1991, based on
completion of ship alterations and ship operational requirements,''
the Navy said.
   The Navy has about 54,000 women on active-duty, or about 9
percent of the force. Of that total, about 5,200 are serving on 86
Navy and Military Sealift Command vessels _ many of them small
ships, including tugs, tenders and auxiliaries of various types.

<HEAD>Calls Made For Wider Arab And Islamic Rupture Of Ties With Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Saudi Arabian newspaper on Friday
called for the expulsion of Iran from the 46-nation Organization of
Islamic Conference and a Kuwaiti newspaper urged Arab countries to
sever ties with the Persian state.
   The calls in the pro-government newspapers followed Saudi
Arabia's rupture of its diplomatic ties with Iran on Tuesday. The
Saudis said they ended relations because of Iran's ``terrorism and
subversion.''
   The Saudi statement referred to riots by Iranian pilgrims at
Mecca last year during the Haj, the annual pilgrimage to Islam's
holiest shrines. More than 400 people died in the violence July 31.
After the riots, Iranians attacked the Saudi Embassy in Iran and
Iranian Revolutionary Guards conducted strikes on commercial
shipping in the Persian Gulf region.
   Urging all Moslem states to follow the Saudi example and sever
their ties with Tehran, the newspaper Al-Yawm said the Islamic
conference ``should also expel Iran and turn over its seat to the
Iranian opposition.''
   Former Iranian leaders Shahpour Bakhtiar and Abolhassan Bani
Sadr, who are living in exile, were among the first to express
support for the Saudi diplomatic break with Tehran.
   The paper noted that the last ministerial conference of the
Islamic organization, held in March in Jordan, had backed the Saudi
condemnation of the Iranian action at Mecca and its determination
to accept only 45,000 Iranian pilgrims at the upcoming Haj as
compared to 150,000 last year.
   The Saudis have asked all Islamic countries to reduce the
numbers of pilgrams because of ongoing renovations at Mecca. The
Iranians have refused.
   ``When the Iranian government refuses to abide by the decision
to limit the numbers of pilgrims, this means it rejects Islamic
unanimity and breaks off from Islamic ranks,'' the paper wrote. It
also accused Iran of being a ``source of terrorism to all
throughout the world.''
   Iran accuses the Saudis of aiding Iraq, its enemy in the
7{-year-old gulf war. The Iranians regularly attack neutral ships,
including Saudi vessels, in retaliation for Iraqi air raids on its
tankers.
   Iran frequently calls for the overthrow of the Saudi government.
   On Thursday, Tehran radio quoted the Martyrs' Foundation, which
helps the families of slain soldiers, as saying: ``It will not be
long before the sacred shrines will be free from the blood-dripping
claws of the corrupt and dependent sheiks.''
   The Martyrs' Foundation said the decision to limit the number of
pilgrims to Mecca was ``grossly impudent and contrary to the
Koran,'' Islam's holy book.
   In Kuwait, the country closest to the Iraq-Iran war and a target
of systematic acts of sabotage by pro-Iranian elements as well as
Iranian missile strikes, the newspaper Al-Anbaa said the government
and other Arab states should follow the Saudi example.
   Iran has also been accused of collusion in the recent hijacking
of a Kuwait Airways jetliner. The hijackers, who killed two
hostages, had demanded the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists
jailed in Kuwait.
   ``As we praise Saudi Arabia's firm and correct decision, we
demand that this decision be turned into a pan-Gulf and even
pan-Arab one because Iran has opted for being an enemy of the Arabs
and it does not conceal its enmity, threats and ambitions but
declare them in a flagrant manner,'' Al-Anbaa wrote.

<TEXT>
   A hundred photographers fanned out across
California on Friday, using thousands of rolls of film for an
everyday portrait of the state.
   It was just another day in Chinatown, where inside a Catholic
school, children began with the pledge of allegiance, a prayer and
a song. Seny Norasingh, one of the photographers for the planned
book ``A Day in the Life of California,'' also was there.
   Norasingh watched the first-graders as they chanted a phonics
lesson, then began to use his camera, crouching near the small
desks. Several other photographers took photos of Norasingh or of
their colleagues taking pictures of him.
   Meanwhile, 99 other men and women with cameras were on
assignment in Chico, Stockton, the Silicon Valley, Fresno, Yosemite
and other places between Crescent City and El Centro for the book.
   The volume, set for fall publication, is part of a series of
books containing photographs taken in a certain place in a single
day.
   ``The concept is extremely easy to grasp and elegantly simple.
That is, you're creating a visual time capsule, a family album,''
said David Cohen, who with Rick Smolan, began the series seven
years ago.
   The books have focused on Australia, Hawaii, Canada, Spain,
America and the Soviet Union.
   Cohen, formerly managing editor of Contact Press Images in New
York, and Smolan, a former Contact photographer, have published
most of the books themselves, but they didn't achieve great
commercial success until the book on America came out in 1986.
   Cohen said he believes a market for another book on California
exists, despite a glut of coffee-table books filled with photos of
the state, because most are filled with cliches of beauty spots
``or they go completely in the other direction and you see a freak
show.''

<HEAD>Mother Removed From Trust Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of teen rocker Tiffany has been
replaced as trustee of the singer's $100,000 trust fund in the
latest development of legal wrangling between the two.
   Janie C. Williams of suburban Norwalk said in an interview
published Friday by the Los Angeles Times that she was removed as
her 16-year-old daughter's trustee Wednesday by Superior Court
Judge Kenneth Black.
   All court documents filed in the dispute have been sealed, and
all hearings have been closed.
   Black named the Bank of California and the accounting firm of
Prager & Fenton as new trustees; boosted the percentage of
Tiffany's record earnings that must go into the trust fund from 30
percent to 50 percent; and authorized the new trustees to make
income tax payments out of the account.
   Tiffany hired attorney John Frankenheimer three weeks ago to act
on her behalf in freeing her finances from both her mother and
manager George Tobin.
   Tiffany has three Top 10 singles, including ``I Think We're
Alone Now,'' and sold more than 4 million copies of her first
album, meaning her royalties should amount to more than $2 million,
according to Tobin's contract with MCA Records, the Times reported.
   Ms. Williams told the Times and alleged in court documents that
Tiffany and Tobin were working toward a break between the singer
and her immediate family, beginning on March 9 when Tiffany's
mother reported her missing because she failed to return home from
Tobin's North Hollywood recording studio.
   The rock star, who does not use her last name, told the Norwalk
Sheriff's Station she was not a runaway, and later filed in court
for status as an emancipated minor, meaning she would have adult
rights in contractual matters.
   ``I felt that George wanted all the control and Tiffany went
along with it because she had her dream of being a star and he
(Tobin) could give it to her,'' Ms. Williams told the newspaper.
``I was never introduced as Tiffany's mother. I was never
introduced to anybody of any great importance. George didn't want
anybody to know I was Tiffany's mother.''
   In late March, Tiffany's aunt, Julie Abbas, was appointed
temporary guardian pending the outcome of the emancipation
proceedings. No hearings have been scheduled on the matter, which
is being handled by a court-appointed mediator.
   Tobin's production contract with Tiffany gives him 50 percent of
her royalties, and a management agreement grants him 20 percent of
her concert earnings.
   Along with those earnings, Tiffany has a $350,000 merchandising
deal with Winterland Productions for Tiffany clothing and
souvenirs, said Ms. Williams' attorney, Neal Goldstein.
   He claimed Tobin ``is attempting to kidnap her through the
court. It's a judicial kidnapping.''
   ``That statement is not worthy of a response,'' Frankenheimer
said. ``We believe the proper forum for deciding this matter is the
court and not the press.''
   Ms. Williams told the newspaper she believes Tobin now could
gain control of the trust, even though Black handed its control
over to neutral third parties.
   Goldstein said Ms. Williams would seek a reconsideration of the
decision, or appeal it.

   A woman convicted of stealing money from the
law firm of a man who recently withdrew as the nominee for deputy
U.S. attorney general was sentenced Friday to 18 months in prison
and fined $5,500.
   Denise Sinner had claimed during her trial that John C.
Shepherd, a partner in the law firm who was nominated to be the No.
2 man in the Justice Department, had authorized her to write checks
to herself because they were having an affair.
   Shepherd denied the accusations under oath, and Sinner never
presented any evidence to show that there had been an affair.
   Sinner, 29, of St. Peters, was sentenced to 12 months in prison
and fined $5,000 for stealing $147,000 from Shepherd, Sandberg &
Phoenix while she worked as a bookkeeper for the firm for several
months beginning mid-1986. She was alleged to have used the money
for personal expenses and to purchase luxury items such as a BMW.
   Sinner was sentenced to an additional six months and fined $500
for making a false statement to the government. The prosecutor said
she had falsely claimed in a doctor's letter to have terminal
cancer.
   Sinner's attorney said the convictions would be appealed. She is
free on $10,000 bond.
   On April 5, Attorney General Edwin Meese chose Shepherd to
become the No. 2 man in the Justice Department in the wake of the
March 29 resignation of Arnold Burns.
   But two weeks later, Shepherd withdrew from consideration for
the job, citing the public scrutiny he was undergoing and the
pressure it was putting on his family.

<TEXT>
   Taiwan and U.S. trade officials wrapped up
four days of negotiations Friday without reaching any agreement as
Taiwan toughened its stand against further liberalization of its
trade practices.
   ``We had hoped to launch a bilateral trade liberalization action
plan,'' U.S. Trade Assistant Peter Allgeier, who heads the U.S.
delegation, said at the end of the talks. ``Unfortunately, we have
fallen short of that ambitious goal.''
   The Taiwan delegation bluntly refused to reduce tariffs on about
60 agricultural products or lift import bans on peanuts, poultry
and animal organs.
   Another U.S. request to renew a five-year bilateral agreement
next year that limits Taiwan's rice exports was also turned down.
   Taiwan called for the scrapping of a 1986 agreement that allows
Taiwanese magazines to advertize American cigarettes, claiming it
promotes smoking and also causes hardship for local tobacco
growers. U.S. officials rejected the request.
   ``We would not consider reducing tariffs on agricultural
products because we did not protect our farmers more than your
country did,'' Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien, who heads
the Taiwan delegation, said at the closing ceremony.
   Taiwan officials, however, promised to review a U.S. proposal
for tariff cuts on about 110 industrial products to help reduce
Taiwan's massive trade surplus with the United States, which
totaled $16 billion last year.
   Hundreds of farmers staged a protest in Taipei on Tuesday,
calling on the government not to concede to any U.S. demands. The
farmers claimed Taiwan's earlier tariff cuts on fruits and other
agricultural products have already hurt their livelihood.
   Taiwan reduced tariffs on 3,500 foreign products in February,
including 480 agricultural products, with import duties dropping to
an average rate of 22.6 percent from 35 percent.
   In the latest talks, Taiwanese negotiators agreed to take
measures to curb the rampant infringement of U.S. copyrights but
differed with their U.S. counterparts on major details.
   Taiwan officials agreed in principle that translations of U.S.
works require the permission of their authors, but opposed making
the agreement retroactive.
   Allgeier said U.S. companies lose ``tens of millions of U.S.
dollars'' every year because of pirated U.S. works in Taiwan.
   Taiwan agreed in 1985 to extend protection to all original U.S.
copyrighted works published after 1975, but pirated books are still
available at many book stores. That agreement does not extend to
translations.
   Taiwan also agreed tentatively to give either patent or
copyright protection to U.S. semiconductor products.

<TEXT>
   Soviet presence has wrought little
change in this city of dusty streets and mud huts, but hatred of
the Kremlin forged an alliance among tribal enemies that lasted 10
years.
   Whether the Moslem guerrillas will revel in their rout of the
Soviets after the Red Army leaves or press on with the fight to
oust President Najib and his Communist government is an open
question.
   The patchwork of tribes and nationalities that joined forces,
more or less, after the Communist coup in April 1978 have a much
longer history of strife and infighting.
   Few of the merchants, farmers, students and government workers
biding their time in the relatively safe capital display much
emotion when asked what they expect to happen when the 115,000
Soviet soldiers are gone.
   Few hold out much hope for Najib, a former head of the secret
police chosen by the Kremlin two years ago to President Babrak
Karmal. The Soviet military forces are to begin leaving by May 15
and be out in nine months.
   Equally few expect a unified opposition to emerge.
   For ordinary Afghans, replacing the peril and loss of the civil
war with the familiar troubles of the past would be welcome.
   ``Afghanistan has always had problems,'' a young taxi driver
observed in broken English. ``What will happen after the Russians
leave, we will see.''
   Dislike of the Soviets and nostalgia for the monarchy ousted by
the military 15 years ago are strong among Afghan civilians.
   They seem eager to return to their former lives, when battles
were as numerous but dealt with land and water instead of ideology.
   Mohammad Mir, an English-speaking antique dealer who parks his
blue Mercedes outside a cluttered shop on Chicken Street, says
business is good despite the war, but he would be happy to leave it
all behind for his native city of Ghazni.
   ``My house there was destroyed twice, so we came to Kabul'' in
the 1970s, he said. The attackers were a neighboring tribe that
coveted his fertile land, not political opponent.
   Mir said he would like to see the king return and the Soviets
leave.
   ``I don't do business with the Russian dogs,'' he told an
American visitor. ``I send them to the Indian next door.''
   Just then, three Soviet soldiers with automatic rifles passed
the shop, looking uncomfortable as they patrolled the shopping
street.
   At the Brezhnev market, a warren of low-roofed hovels in central
Kabul named for the late Soviet leader, there is a brisk trade in
Soviet machinery and spare parts. One merchant said he would leave
soon for his home in western Afghanistan because Soviet troops
there were packing up to leave.
   How will he make a living after a decade of dealing in Soviet
hardware? He shrugged and said: ``We made our business in other
ways before the Soviets came and we will make it in other ways when
they leave.''
   About 2 million people live in Kabul. It crouches in dun-colored
poverty in a broad basin ringed by high mountains, which the
guerrillas control.
   Women wearing full-length pleated silk veils sort onions,
carrots and geens for sale in their market stalls, as others did
for generations before the Soviets came.
   Crowds of shoppers and traders throng the narrow walkways
between open troughs carrying waste water. The smell of raw sewage
from the Kabul River mingles with exotic scents from the spice
shops.
   Rocket fire occasionally reaches the city from the mountains.
Car bombs have become more frequent, like the one that killed six
passersby and wounded 49 other people on Wednesday, the 10th
anniversary of the Communist coup.
   Mohammad Masum said he believes fewer than 20 percent of Afghans
are concerned with politics and even he, a member of Najib's party,
is ready to cope with whatever political situation develops.
   He and other Afghans are just tired of war.
   ``I think if there was a true coalition government, including
the king, we would all be happy,'' Masud said.
   Najib has offered the guerrillas a coalition but they have
refused.
   At a news conference Thursday he suggested a role in the
government for former King Sahir Shah, who lives in Italy, but did
not say what it would be.
   ``I just want to go to my home as soon as they will let me,''
said Masum, an interpreter with the party Committee for Peace,
Solidarity and Friendship. He and his wife fled their village
outside Kabul in the early days of the war.
   ``I'm not afraid of either side,'' he said. ``Now I interpret
for the government. Maybe later I will interpret for someone else.''

<TEXT>
   Disgruntled truckers are queuing up into
50-rig convoys and creeping along Indiana interstates to protest a
new state law that has boosted the gasoline tax and lowered the
speed limit for large vehicles.
   The convoys are a new wrinkle in a month-old protest by truckers
boycotting Indiana truckstops, gas stations and restaurants to call
attention to regulations that hurt their business.
   State police have tracked 12 convoys since Tuesday night, when
the first was reported, Lt. Ken Hollingsworth said Friday.
   The lined-up trucks were moving about 40-55 mph, staying in one
lane for the most part, and not interfering with regular vehicular
traffic, said Hollingsworth.
   The convoys averaged about 50 semi tractor-trailers, and most
were reported on Interstate 70, which passes from Ohio to Illinois
through Indianapolis.
   The truckers are unhappy with a state law that went into effect
April 1 lowering the speed limit for heavy trucks from 65 mph to 55
mph on rural sections of interstates. For light trucks and cars,
the speed limit remains 65 mph.
   Indiana also boosted its gasoline tax by 1 cent per gallon
earlier this month.
   Ron Vernon, a trucker from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said the lowered
speed limit would take money out of his pocket.
   ``If I slow down, I lose $2 or $3 per hour,'' said Vernon, who
had stopped Friday to eat at the Indy 500 Truck Plaza in
Whitestown, just south of Indianapolis. ``We're the only occupation
in the country that gets penalized for working overtime.''
   Truckers weren't the only ones complaining.
   Dave Martin, owner of the Stop 1 Truck Plaza in Cambridge City,
said the boycott had cut his food and fuel sales by 30 percent.
   Martin said although he thought the truckers have a legitimate
complaint, he does not approve of their methods.
   ``I agree the state is doing the wrong thing, but why don't they
go to the Legislature and circle the wagons?'' Martin asked.
   The boycott was the brainchild of Cincinnati disc jockey Dale
Sommers, whose ``Interstate 700'' show is broadcast nightly on
WLW-AM.
   Sommers, who goes by the name ``Truckin' Bozo'' on the air, is
one of the founders of the four-month-old North American
Professional Truckers Association, which represents about 2,000
truckers. He said he drove an 18-wheeler for one week in 1968.
   ``Their votes are in another state and don't count in Indiana,''
Sommers said of his trucker listeners and why he urged the boycott
of truckstops, gas stations and restaurants in the state. ``You
have to make the voters in Indiana pay attention.''
   Indianapolis independent contractor James Walden said the
Indiana protest may be the start of a nationwide movement.
   ``This thing's going to grow. It's starting here, but it's going
coast to coast,'' said Walden.

<HEAD>No Breakthrough In Sight For Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 40-nation Geneva Conference on Disarmament
wound up its spring session Friday with no breakthrough in sight on
a global ban on chemical weapons even though many delegates agree
the ban is more urgent than ever.
   Negotiations on a convention prohibiting the development,
production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons and providing for
their destruction dominated the three-month meeting.
   However, early pronouncements that a text could be finalized
this year clashed with the reality of the complexities involved,
delegates said.
   Hungary's David Meiszter, president of the conference for April,
told a press conference that he was optimistic that agreement will
come ``in the near future.''
   But other conference sources, while acknowledging further
progress, simply said many unresolved problems make any predictions
impossible.
   At the same time, addresses to the conference have stressed that
the continued use of chemical weapons in the war between Iraq and
Iran have added urgency to the 20-year-old negotiations.
   The latest addition to the potential stumbling blocks is
France's insistence on provisions allowing ``security stocks'' of
chemical weapons for eight years after the convention enters into
force.
   France argues that such a possibility is needed in view of the
``very large disproportion'' between existing chemical stocks. This
is an evident reference to the Soviet arsenal.
   The Soviets say they have 50,000 tons of chemical weapons, but
Western intelligence sources say that is a gross understatement.
   Obsolete U.S. chemical weapons stockpiled in West Germany are to
be removed in 1992 under an informal understanding between
Washington and Bonn. This would leave the Soviets with the only
chemical weapons left on European territory.
   Diplomatic sources who insisted on anonymity said no other
delegation supports the French proposal because in effect it would
give countries that do not have chemical weapons the go-ahead to
start production of the arms the moment the convention is ratified.
   ``It is the top issue now,'' said one Western source. ``I can't
see any treaty if France sticks to its position.''
   The chief U.S. representative, ambassador Max Friedersdorf, was
quoted in an interview as saying that the negotiations are getting
to the point ``where we are going to have one (a ban) or not going
to have one.''
   Friedersdorf said the problems with the treaty range from
details of anti-cheating provisions to monitoring the civilian
industry to make surce that chemicals are not diverted to hostile
uses.
   The interview was printed in the U.S. Mission's Daily Bulletin.
It did not include any mention of the French proposal.
   Up to now, the Soviet Union and the United States are the only
member countries that have admitted possession of chemical weapons.
The United States has not officially disclosed its reserves but
they are generally reported to total less than 30,000 tons.
   Western sources estimate at least 15 other countries may have
chemical weapons.

<HEAD>Operation Planned To Separate Twins Joined At Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical team plans a
marathon, high-risk operation to separate 16-month-old Siamese
twins joined at the head, doctors said Friday.
   Doctors at Baragwanath Hospital, the main hospital in the black
township outside Johannesburg, performed two preliminary operations
in October in preparation for Tuesday's surgery. The procedure is
expected to take at least nine hours.
   The twin girls, Mpho and Mphonyana, were born Dec. 7, 1986, to
Sophie Mathibela, an unmarried, 33-year-old black domestic worker
who earns about $60 a month.
   The girls share a major blood vessel in their heads. Doctors
partially clamped the vein in the earlier operations in hopes that
lesser blood vessels would take over its functions.
   Dr. Robert Lipschitz, head of the medical team, said the chances
for success were not high, but that doctors would not sacrifice one
of the girls to save the other.
   ``This is going to be a long, lengthy, intricate operation which
carries many dangers with it,'' Lipschitz told a news conference
Friday. ``The prognosis is still very grave.''
   ``Though the chances are still not in both the children's favor,
at this moment they appear to stand the best chance that we can
give them under the present state of the art,'' he said.
   The girls have a combined weight of 33 pounds. Mpho appears to
be developing normally and recently began to speak, while Mphonyana
is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as advanced, the
hospital said.
   The Baragwanath doctors have received advice from Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore, where in September doctors separated West
German twins joined at the head. Both boys survived and were sent
home in March, but they reportedly are suffering physical and
mental problems.
   Ms. Mathibela was asked to make a $5 contribution to the costs
of the operation, which otherwise are being covered by the hospital
and the University of the Witwatersrand medical school.

   The seconds are ticking down for the castle that
once kept the world running like a clock, a victim of changing
times.
   Herstmonceux Castle, the home of the Royal Greenwich
Observatory, went on sale Thursday for an estimated $11.2 million
to $18.7 million.
   The observatory, where Greenwich Mean Time was once calculated
as the reference point for the world's time zones, is expected to
move into Cambridge University in 1990.
   Time, apparently, has passed the operation by.
   ``The reason for the move from Herstmonceux Castle is that most
of the observatory's observational work is now done overseas,
atmospheric conditions abroad being far more favorable than
anywhere in the British Isles,'' said Bill Yates, a London real
estate agent.
   ``As a result, a new home base more suited to the requirements
of modern astronomy is to be built at Cambridge.''
   Astronomers were up in arms two years ago when the government
said it would sell the castle in southern England, 21 miles
northeast of Brighton in the county of East Sussex, and move the
observatory.
   Greenwich Royal Observatory clocks, first at Greenwich and then
at Herstmonceux, once calculated Greenwich Mean Time for the world.
But in the past decade, Britain has only been a minor contributor
to a Paris-based international time service that uses 250 clocks
around the world.
   The observatory said in 1985 that for financial reasons it would
let its six atomic clocks stop after 101 years of calculating
Greenwich Mean Time. The clocks contain the atomic element cesium,
which must be replaced every few years at a cost of nearly $200,000.
   The observatory's main functions now are confined to supporting
its new telescopes in the Canary Islands and in Hawaii, where clean
air permits observation, but Britain's astronomers still opposed
the move to Cambridge.
   They said it would scatter the observatory's archives and rare
books and end three centuries of independent excellence.
   The observatory was founded in 1675 by King Charles II. It moved
to its present location _ a 20th century copy of the original
Herstmonceux castle _ in 1946 because pollution interfered with
stargazing at its Greenwich location in southeast London.
   The buildings at Greenwich, along with the brass strip marking
longitude zero, the Prime Meridian from which the world measures
its time zones, remain open as a museum.
   Yates predicted the sale of the castle, which stands on 368 lush
acres, will generate inquiries from around the world.

<HEAD>President Signs Measure On International Child Custody Disputes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Friday
designed to make it easier for parents to recover children who have
been wrongfully abducted across international borders in domestic
custody disputes.
   The measure implements the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil
Aspects of International Child Abduction, to which the United
States is a party. The convention creates a treaty obligation for
the prompt return of such children.
   The convention was written to cover instances such as one in
which an American marries a German while stationed in West Germany
with the armed forces, they have a child and settle in the United
States, and the German partner then returns to Germany with the
child.
   Supporters of the measure said current law provides no way to
assure speedy determination of custody rights in such a situation.
   The administration supported the bill, although the Justice
Department objected to one provision giving federal and state
courts concurrent jurisdiction to hear cases brought under the
convention. The department contended that federal courts never have
been, and should not be, involved in custody matters.

<TEXT>
   Mexican physicist Marcos Moshinsky and
Spanish physicist Manuel Cardona shared the 1988 Prince of Asturias
Prize for Science, it was announced Friday.
   A 10-member jury unanimously chose the two men for the prize,
citing their ``respective contributions to physics and quantum
physics.'' The jury was chaired by Severo Ochoa, the Spanish Nobel
laureate in medicine.
   The prize consists of $8,000 and an original sculpture by
Spanish artist Joan Miro.
   Moshinsky, 67, a native of the Ukraine and a naturalized
Mexican, heads the department of theoretical physics at the
National Autonomous University in Mexico City, where he also
studied. He received his doctorate from Princeton University in
1949 and has published four books.
   The jury recognized ``his decisive contributions to the study of
the (mathematical) symmetries of the basic laws of nature that have
permitted a better understanding of quantum physics, which explains
the behavior of elementary particles.''
   Cardona, 54, a native of Barcelona, is the director of the Max
Planck Institute for Solid State Science Research in Stuttgart,
West Germany, and has taught at Brown University in Providence,
R.I. He graduated from the University of Barcelona, Spain, and
Harvard University.
   The jury cited the Spaniard for his ``important discoveries in
the study of materials that serve as the basis of many of the new
technologies, and because his work combines significant
contributions to basic science with key ideas for their use in
later applications.''
   The Prince of Asturias Foundation is based in Oviedo, the
capital of the northwestern region of Asturias.

   Two Marine helicopter pilots missing since
U.S.-Iranian fighting in the Persian Gulf on April 18 were declared
``killed in action'' Friday after the corps disclosed that a
hostile radar had targeted their copter before it disappeared.
   A Marine fact-finding board, ``after reviewing all the evidence
in this case, determined that there was sufficient evidence to
conclude that these Marines had been killed as a result of hostile
action, sustained in combat or relating thereto,'' the corps said
in a statement.
   The corps refused to say the AH-1T Cobra gunship flown by Capt.
Stephen C. Leslie and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill had definitely been
shot down by Iranian forces, as Iran has claimed.
   But the statement conceded: ``In making its recommendation, the
fact-finding body provided the following explanation: `While being
vectored (directed) to identify an unknown surface contact, Capts.
Hill and Leslie reported a fire control radar lock-on. The USS
Wainwright lost communication and radar contact with Capts. Hill
and Leslie.'''
   The term ``surface contact'' is normally used to refer to a
radar signal indicating the presence of a boat. A fire control
radar is used to track targets for a gun or missile.
   The Wainwright, a cruiser from which the two Marines were
flying, was attacked at one point during last week's fighting by an
Iranian patrol boat, suggesting other Iranian boats could have been
in the area.
   Leslie, 30, of New Bern, N.C., and Hill, 33, of Thomasville,
N.C., were assigned to Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 167
at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.
   During the day of fighting between U.S. Navy ships and Iranian
vessels, the two were sent up on what the Pentagon has described as
a routine patrol after the Wainwright helped destroy an Iranian
offshore platform.
   During the fighting, the Navy sank or crippled six Iranian
vessels without any of its ships being hit. With the exception of
the two missing Marines, no Americans were injured or killed in
those battles. Forty-four Iranians were reported killed.
   On April 20, when the two Marines were formally declared
missing, the Pentagon disclosed it was investigating a radio
challenge to the Cobra heard before it disappeared.
   Friday's statement, disclosing Leslie and Hill had themselves
reported a hostile radar contact, provided the first indication the
helicopter had become a target.
   Pentagon officials until Friday had played down Iran's claims to
have destroyed the Cobra, noting the Iranians did not begin making
the claim until after the Defense Department itself announced the
helicopter was overdue.
   But in its new statement, the Marine Corps said its fact-finding
board had concluded there was ``sufficient evidence to conclude
that these Marines had been killed as a result of hostile action
... (even though) neither the helicopter nor the remains of the
pilots have yet been recovered.''
   ``... It is not necessary to have recovered the remains to make
a determination of `killed in action,''' the service added.

   Thousands of black and
mixed-race students near Johannesburg and Cape Town boycotted class
Friday, protesting the detention of teachers and restrictions on
anti-apartheid activity.
   One foreign photographer was arrested at one demonstration and
detained for more than an hour.
   Eight secondary schools in Tembisa, a black township northeast
of Johannesburg, were deserted for a second straight day to protest
the detention of an English teacher, education department officials
said
   The teacher, Themba Mohambi, was detained Monday and released
Thursday, officials said.
   No official reasons for his detention were given, but The
Sowetan, a black-oriented daily newspaper, said it was believed to
be related to Mohambi's involvement in anti-apartheid political
activity.
   A boycott also was reported at a high school in Soweto because
of the detention of a teacher there.
   In Athlone, a mixed-race township near Cape Town, several
hundred students demonstrated outside their high school Friday,
protesting actions by the security forces, the suspension of
teachers and restrictions on anti-apartheid activity.
   News photographer Eric Miller, who was working for Reuters, the
British news agency, was arrested during the demonstration outside
Alexander Sinton High School.
   Miller was taken to a police station where he was held for more
than an hour before being released, other photographers said.
Police told Miller he was under investigation for allegedly
violating state of emergency regulations which prohibit journalists
from being at the scene of unrest.
   The demonstration was the latest in a series of protests and
boycotts in the Cape Town area in two weeks in one of the most
extensive outbreaks of political unrest in the schools since a
nationwide classroom boycott ended in 1986.
   Police said one Athlone school was set one fire Thursday and
extensively damaged. In nearby Bonteheuwel, police said, a bus was
firebombed and a private vehicle stoned.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says He Made Progress With Reagan On Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney told Parliament on
Friday he made some headway in Washington toward curtailing U.S.
acid rain emissions reaching Canada, but opposition parties taunted
him for the lack of results.
   ``The tables have turned and we have a greater opportunity to
arrive at a valid treaty with the United States,'' Mulroney said
after returning from talks with President Reagan and congressional
leaders.
   Both the opposition Liberal Party and New Democratic Party
slammed the Conservative prime minister, who has emerged from four
annual summits with Reagan claiming progress on acid rain, only to
be disappointed by a lack of U.S. action.
   In a heated exchange in the House of Commons, New Democratic
Party leader Ed Broadbent ridiculed Mulroney's latest claim and
described Reagan as ``the only head of government in the modern
world who believes that trees cause pollution.''
   Reagan once said birds and trees contribute to air pollution and
has refused to order costly acid rain controls.
   ``The prime minister, in four years of talks, four years of
buttering up to Reagan telling him everything he wanted to hear,
hasn't got one bit of progress on acid rain,'' Broadbent said.
   But Mulroney and Foreign Minister Joe Clark noted that Reagan
asked Secretary of State George Shultz to begin priority talks with
Clark on an eight-point proposal Mulroney delivered with respect to
an acid rain treaty.
   Clark termed the Washington talks ``a significant new chapter
opened.''
   He noted that during the summit, U.S. negotiators at United
Nations-sponsored talks in Geneva dropped their demand for the
right to emit 20 percent more nitrogen oxides.
   At a news conference in Washington late Thursday, Mulroney said
he would remain persistent on the issue, but not become belligerent.
   ``What do you do? Do you declare war? Interrupt relationships?''
he asked rhetorically.
   Mulroney added that leading members of congress also reacted
favorably to his call for a 50 percent reduction in the U.S.
smokestack emissions causing at least of Canada's acid rain.
   ``A treaty is inevitable between the two countries,'' he said.
   The major causes of acid rain are nitrogen oxides from motor
vehicle exhausts and sulfur dioxides from power plants.

<TEXT>
   A fund drive has raised most of the $5.6 million
needed to buy a 17th century masterpiece by Georges de la Tour, and
the government said Friday it will provide the rest so the painting
will remain in France.
   The austere portrait ``St. Thomas'' is the last work of de la
Tour (1593-1652) still in private hands.
   With the campaign closing Saturday, about $4.2 million of the
necessary 32 million has been raised from bequests, corporations
and visitors to the Louvre Museum.
   The final contribution from Finance Ministry will allow the
Louvre to buy the painting from the Knights of Malta, an
international charity group founded in the 11th century.
   It has been on show at the Jeu de Paume, a Louvre annex, since
the campaign began March 22 and has attracted thousands of
visitors, many of whom put dropped modest donations into the tall
black urn at the entrance, said Louvre spokeswoman Sylvie Poujade.
   When the fund drive began, Finance Minister Eduoard Balladur
said the government would pay a substantial share to keep the
painting in France. Ministry officials confirmed Friday that state
funds would put the campaign over the top.
   The Knights of Malta acquired the painting in 1985 in the will
of Anne de Ruille, an unmarried countess who lived alone in her
castle in central France. The masterpiece, which she was said to
keep under her bed, was a family heirloom, Ms. Poujade said.
   Rules of the order, a non-profit group specializing in hospital
work, require it to sell such valuable possessions and use the
money for its charities.
   Officials of the organization said several foreigners offered to
buy the painting but it preferred to give France an opportunity to
add it to de la Tour paintings already in the Louvre, including the
famous ``Tricheur'' (Cheater).
   Proceeds from the sale will help build a hospital in France for
the mentally and physically handicapped, the order said.

<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products in April
were unchanged, on average, for the second month in a row but were
still 4 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   ``Prices were higher for soybeans, cattle, hay and oranges, and
lower for lettuce, eggs, milk and strawberries,'' the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
   New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet
expenses were up 1.8 percent from January and averaged 3.7 percent
more than in April 1987.
   ``Higher prices for feeder pigs, fertilizer, agricultural
chemicals, tractors and other machinery contributed most to the
increase from January,'' the report said.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers set a
record in 1987 of about $57 billion. This year's net _ the
difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the
range of $50 billion to $55 billion.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.1 percent average increase in 1987.
   According to the preliminary April figures, based mostly on
mid-month averages, the index for livestock and livestock products
was unchanged from March but was up 0.7 percent from a year ago.
   ``Higher prices for cattle, calves and broilers were offset by
lower prices for eggs, milk and hogs,'' the report said.
   Crop prices overall were up 0.9 percent from March and averaged
9.9 percent more than a year ago.
   The price index for oil-bearing crops, which consist mainly of
soybeans, was up 3.3 percent from March and averaged 22 percent
more than in April 1987. Soybeans prices, at $6.36 per bushel, were
up 30 cents during the month.
   Prices paid to commercial vegetable growers, overall, dropped
4.4 percent from March and also were down 4.4 percent from a year
ago.
   The prices of most individual vegetables rose from March to
April, but those increases were more than offset by a sharp drop
for lettuce and a seasonal decline in asparagus prices.
   April farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base
used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures, the same
as in March and February. A year ago the April index was 125
percent.
   The quarterly parity ratio was reported at 51 percent in April,
down two percentage points from the revised January reading of 53
percent. The revised parity ratio for April 1987 also was 51
percent.
   Although many economists say the old parity standard is outmoded
because it doesn't take into full account changes in farm
productivity, others contend the ratio is useful in comparing
year-to-year changes.
   Under the parity formula, prices farmers get for commodities are
compared with prices they pay to meet expenses. It then uses a
1910-14 measurement to express what happened. At 100 percent, the
indicator would theoretically mean farmers had the same buying
power as they had in 1910-14.
   For example, the average price of wheat in April was $2.81 per
bushel, according to the preliminary figures. That was 40 percent
of the parity price of $7.07 per bushel.
   The report also said:
   _Cattle averaged $68.90 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $68.30 in March and above the $62.60 reported
for April 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as
beef.
   _Hogs averaged $41.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $42.20 in
March and $50.80 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $1.85 a bushel, was down from $1.86 in March, but was
up from the average of $1.52 a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.81 per bushel, compared with $2.74 in March and $2.63 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $8.41 per 100 pounds, compared with $8.79 in
March and $3.63 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $6.36 per bushel, compared with $6.06 in March
and $4.90 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 57.3 cents per pound, compared
with 57.7 in March and 50.4 cents in April 1987.
   _Eggs were 45.5 cents per dozen, compared with 50.8 cents in
March and 54.8 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $11.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $11.90 in March
and $12.20 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 28 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
27.5 cents in March and 29.2 cents a year ago.

   Spattered by blood and buffeted by debris
after their plane's roof blew off high over the Pacific, the
frightened passengers aboard Aloha Airlines Flight 243 helped one
another into life jackets and waited calmly.
   A stewardess was blown out of the Boeing 737, and 60 of the 89
passengers and remaining crew of four were injured before the plane
made a safe emergency landing here Thursday.
   ``I heard a loud explosion and I saw my bag from under the seat
in front of me fly right out of the aircraft,'' said David Kupihea,
who was in the first-class section at the front of the plane.
   A piece of conduit ripped loose from the plane and punctured
Kupihea's arm.
   ``I kept my head down; I pulled out my life vest; I used it as a
cushion. You can see the wind blowing in your face,'' he said.
   Kupihea said he noticed that the passenger next to him, John
Lopez, was bleeding so he covered him with a seat cover.
   ``When I looked out of the aircraft and saw the island of Maui,
I told him, `Hang on, John, hang on, we're going to Maui.''
   Lopez, 40, of Hilo, needed seven stitches to close a cut on his
head.
   The passengers were frightened but calm, some of them reported
after the severely disabled plane made a safe emergency landing
here, about 15 minutes after the plane was ripped apart during a
flight from Hilo, on Hawaii Island, to Honolulu.
   Dan Dennin, a salesman from Honolulu, was reading in a window
seat near the back of the plane when the jet was rocked by the
blast. At first he thought his window had blown out, but he looked
up and saw a gaping hole just behind the cockpit.
   ``A third of the roof was gone ... I looked up and saw blue
sky,'' he said.
   The intercom system no longer worked, but oxygen masks dropped
in front of passengers where the roof was still intact.
   ``But the wind just blew them away. We couldn't use them,'' said
passenger Mae Kagihara.
   The passengers helped each other don life-jackets and tuck their
heads down between their legs, according to several passengers. As
the plane landed, passengers applauded and cheered, they said.
   The uninjured then helped those who were hurt.
   ``There was debris all over the place,'' said Kagihara. ``When
that thing ripped open, there was all that debris flying around.
   ``The guy sitting next to the aisle got hit and there was blood
all over,'' she said. ``It was all over the place. We are lucky to
be alive,'' Kagihara said.
   Alice Godwin of Boulder City, Nev., said she had put on a life
jacket and placed her head between her knees.
   ``I sang all the hymns I knew,'' she said. ``That kept me busy.''
   Rick West, a banker from Hilo, said the passengers remained very
calm.
   ``It was just a matter of waiting to see what would happen,'' he
said. ``It was a long wait.''
   ``Everyone was calm. Everyone was trying to help each other,''
said Stanford Samson, a Honolulu PBX supervisor.
   Kagihara and Samson said they didn't think the plane would be
able to land.
   ``I thought we were going to hit water. I thought, `This is
it,''' Samson said.
   ``At first I thought we were going to crash in the ocean,''
Kagihara said. ``Then when we got close to land, I thought at least
I could swim.''
   The passengers appeared calm after they landed on Maui, said
Kevin Hildebrant, a tour driver who helped take the injured to Maui
Memorial Hospital.
   ``They were overly calm, I guess, to compensate for what they
went through,'' he said.

   Senate Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd said
Friday he will call up the medium-range missile treaty for debate
on ratification May 11, but only if the White House and Kremlin
quickly resolve disputes over on-site inspection and other issues.
   The State Department said the treaty's anti-cheating provisions
are effective but branded as unacceptable a new Soviet
interpretation of how they should work in practice.
   The department renewed its call for quick Senate action to
ratify the treaty before President Reagan meets with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Moscow summit next month.
   However, Charles E. Redman, the department spokesman, said the
Soviets had taken a ``restrictive'' view of the right of the United
States to inspect containers for missile components as well as to
inspect Soviet medium-range missile facilities.
   The State Department has raised the issue with the Soviets at a
senior diplomatic level and is awaiting a reply, Redman said.
   Byrd said the Soviet statement indicates to him that Moscow is
``backing away'' from the mutual understanding the two sides had of
how on-site inspection would work.
   He and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said the treaty cannot be ratified before the
issue is resolved.
   ``I believe the Soviet Union should understand it is not a good
thing to start off by challenging a couple of the key points of
on-site inspection,'' Nunn said.
   ``It is enormously important that we go into this treaty with
good faith on both sides,'' he said. ``We don't need any clouds of
bad faith hanging over it.''
   Byrd emphasized that his decision to call up the treaty is
tentative and debate will not begin on May 11 _ less than three
weeks before the Moscow summit _ unless all areas of concern are
resolved.
   Byrd called on both Washington and Moscow to quickly deal with
on-site inspection problems as well as other issues.
   These include an ambiguity in the treaty regarding a precise
definition as to what constitutes a weapons delivery system and
whether or not such Star Wars weapons as those using laser beams or
particle-beam generators are covered by the pact.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said another area of concern involves the White House
rather than the Soviets.
   The problem, Boren said, is whether the administration is
backing away from a commitment to an expanded long-range investment
in spy satellites and other technical means used to verify Soviet
compliance with the terms of arms control treaties.
   The intelligence panel has said that Soviet compliance with any
treaty making deep cuts in long-range strategic weapons will be
difficult unless such an investment is made.
   ``Hopefully we will be able to say all of these problems have
been resolved and we will be able to go ahead full speed from there
and these loose ends will be tied down,'' Boren said.
   Byrd said he had no idea how long the ratification debate will
take once it begins.
   ``We have to be absolutely certain this is a good treaty,'' he
said. ``If we get our fingers burned on this, it isn't going to
augur well for future arms control.''
   The treaty would require the destruction of U.S. and Soviet
medium-range missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles.

<HEAD>Dukakis Twice Attacked on Foreign Policy Issues</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Dukakis aide's quote, subbing last graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis absorbed twin attacks on
foreign policy Friday, as Vice President George Bush accused him of
``waffling all over the field'' when the administration attacked
Iranian gunboats and Jesse Jackson called his views on southern
Africa misguided.
   Bush, the certain Republican nominee, also previewed a second
likely campaign issue for the fall, saying he favors the death
penalty for convicted drug kingpins. Dukakis, the likely Democratic
nominee, opposes the death penalty in all cases.
   The Massachusetts governor focused on trade issues as he
campaigned in Ohio in advance of next week's presidential primary,
renewing his call for President Reagan not to veto legislation that
would in part require companies to give advance notice before
shutting down factories.
   ``These people are our neighbors.'' he said of factory workers
who would be affected. ``They deserve better from their employers.
They deserve better from America,'' he said.
   As Dukakis campaigned in Ohio, his aides said they were
beginning to court delegates won by exiled campaign rivals with a
``soft sell'' campaign. Dukakis aides have expressed confidence in
recent days that the governor will have the 2,081 delegates needed
to assure his nomination by the end of the primary season on June 7.
   He now has more than 1,250 delegates in the Associated Press
total, and enjoys a lead of roughly 400 over Jackson.
   Bush's remarks uttered in a trip through Indiana provided a
preview of what a fall campaign against Dukakis might sound like.
Jackson's remarks to an audience in Cleveland showed he was far
from ready to give up his efforts to compete through the end of the
Democratic primaries.
   The vice president, who already has clinched enough delegates to
assure his nomination, criticized Dukakis on economic, law and
order and foreign policy grounds.
   The vice president said Dukakis wavered initially when asked to
respond to the administration's military retailiation against Iran
earlier this month.
   ``The president's different than anything else. You can't wait
around, hold your finger in the wind and see what the polls show,''
said Bush.
   Bush, who is expected to make Dukakis' relative lack of
experience in foreign affairs an issue in the fall campaign,
concluded:
   ``You can't do that when you're president. You can't wait around
to see which way the wind blows.''
   Dukakis initially said he didn't have enough information to
judge the administration's actions, and said he shouldn't comment
while he was concentrating on his New York primary campaign.
   Bush also dismissed comments from Dukakis and Jackson on the
importance of fighting drugs as mere campaign rhetoric.
   ``I haven't heard them talk about how tough they want to be in
changing the laws so we at least put some muscle into the law. ...
I strongly favor the death penalty for the narco-traffickers,'' he
said.
   On the plant-closing issue that Dukakis has been campaigning on
in recent days, Bush said his likely Democratic rival is more
concerned about ``pink slips and plant closings'' than in creating
new jobs.
   ``I don't feel that it's midnight in America,'' he said. ``I
want to talk about the fact that ... there are more Americans at
work than any time in the history of the country.''
   Jackson, who has been increasingly critical of Dukakis in recent
days following a string of primary defeats, assailed his rival for
not wanting to classify South Africa as a terrorist state for
allegedly supporting rebels battling Mozambique.
   ``It exposes a lack of understanding of foreign policy,'' he
said. ``Either (he) has a lack of understanding about the options
in the region or he supports a policy that's inconsistent with the
progressive and democratic thrust in the world.''
   Dukakis has rejected Jackson's call to provide arms to
Mozambique's Marxist government to fight the rebels. Campaign aide
Leslie Dach said Dukakis favors diplomatic steps and economic
sanctions against South Africa that the Reagan administration has
not taken, but ``doesn't rule out possibly down the road arming
front-line states'' in their struggle with South Africa.

<HEAD>INS Chief Lauds Congressional Refusal to Extend Amnesty Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top immigration official
expressed satisfaction Friday that Congress refused to extend the
12-month amnesty program for illegal aliens which ends at midnight
Wednesday.
   Alan Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, also said that a program of sanctions against employers
who hire illegal aliens is being imposed gradually and that
companies should not anticipate a ``crackdown'' by the INS.
   In opposing an extension of the amnesty program, Nelson told
reporters in an interview that the purpose of the
year-and-a-half-old law of which the amnesty program is a part ``is
to stop illegal immigration.''
   ``We wouldn't want to send a message below the border that it's
still OK to come here illegally and then if you do there still
might be amnesty,'' said Nelson. ``Congress made it clear, `One
time only' and stuck to their guns.''
   Nelson said legalization offices will be open Saturday and
Sunday. Offices also will be open until midnight Wednesday and
amnesty candidates standing in line at that time will be processed.
   The Senate on Thursday night blocked a seven-month extension of
the amnesty program for undocumented immigrants.
   Although amnesty requests have soared in recent weeks as the
deadline approaches, applications are running significantly behind
initial projections. Amnesty requests total 1.29 million with
another 440,000 people applying under a program for agricultural
workers. The INS had estimated as many as 2 million would apply.
   Nelson said ``nobody knows'' how many illegal aliens might
qualify for the amnesty program and he downplayed the 2 million
figure. He said applications are falling somewhat below initial
estimates partly because non-profit groups and other non-government
community groups overestimated the number of applications they
would help the INS handle.
   Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, aliens who
came to this country illegally before Jan. 1, 1982 and who have
lived here continually since then may apply for amnesty.
   The program also contains a system of fines for employers who
knowingly hire undocumented workers.
   Starting June 1, the INS has the discretion to issue warning
citations or to levy fines against employers who violate the law.
Currently, the INS must initially issue warning citations.
   Nelson stressed the agency would remain flexible, saying there
won't be a ``crackdown'' with fines starting June 1.
   ``The purpose of sanctions isn't to penalize employers,'' said
Nelson. ``The purpose is to keep employers from hiring illegal
aliens and if you can do it with a positive twist you're a lot
better off.
   ``Be sure they're educated, be sure they understand why it's
good business for them'' to not hire cheap illegal labor, said
Nelson.
   ``We can always tighten the screws to the employers and we're
doing that,'' but he said the sanctions portion of the program
would proceed through a ``gradual, deliberate building process.''
   The agency is to hire 900 additional investigators through the
beginning of next year and one of their prime duties will be to
participate in the employer sanctions program.
   To date, the INS has issued 2,000 citations to employers and
levied 80 to 90 fines.

   Actor Burt Reynolds and longtime companion
Loni Anderson were married Friday at a private ceremony in a
specially built white chapel at his 160-acre horse ranch, spokesmen
said.
   Reynolds, the 52-year-old star of ``Deliverance,'' ``Smokey and
the Bandit'' and ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'' announced
his marriage intentions two months ago in a magazine article, but
he refused to say when or where he would marry his girlfriend of
five years.
   Peggy Gossett, spokeswoman for the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theater,
said the ceremony was completed at midafternoon Friday and the
reception was under way. Mickey Freeman, publicist for Ms.
Anderson; and David Gershenson, Reynolds' personal manager, also
confirmed Friday that the ceremony was set for the afternoon in the
chapel at Reynolds' ranch here.
   The marriage is the third for the 41-year-old bride, best known
for her role as the not-so-dumb blonde secretary in the TV series
``WKRP in Cincinnati.'' It's Reynolds' second marriage.
   Officiating was the Rev. Jess Moody of California, and guests
included singer-actress Ann-Margaret and her husband, Roger Smith;
Ms. Anderson's daughter from a prior marriage, Diedra Hoffman; Ms.
Anderson's sister; Reynolds' parents and sister; actor-singer Jim
Nabors; and Perry Como; as well as numerous other celebrities,
Gossett said.
   Nabors was to sing at the ceremony, Freeman had said in a
telephone interview from his Los Angeles office.
   Ms. Anderson wore a knee-length, strapless white jersey dress
fitted with a beaded lace jacket, he said.
   Freeman said he understood the newlyweds planned to leave by
helicopter for a Bahamas honeymoon after a reception at Reynolds'
second Palm Beach County home, on the Intracoastal Waterway in
Jupiter.
   Before the wedding, local companies scurried to deliver
champagne, ice, flowers and party supplies to Reynolds' ranch,
which is behind a barrier of 10-foot-high metal gates.
   Reynolds, the son of the former police chief of West Palm Beach,
played halfback for Florida State University on the 1953-54
Seminole team.
   Although he never graduated, Reynolds treated the school well
after he achieved fame, setting up an intern program for students
at his Burt Reynolds Dinner Theater and giving FSU $600,000 to
endow a theater professorship. In 1981, FSU gave an honorary degree
to Reynolds.
   His first marriage was to onetime ``Laugh-In'' star Judy Carne.

<HEAD>House Panel Defeats Bid To Make States Ante Up for Super Collider</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee Friday refused to require
states seeking the super collider atom smasher to put up at least
$500 million in cash or services to land the eagerly pursued
research installation.
   On a 20-11 vote, the Space, Science and Technology Committee
rejected the minimum-funds amendment offered by Rep. Ron Packard,
R-Calif., for the $4.4 billion superconducting super collider.
   Just before that, members voted 16-14 against an alternative
that would have required the secretary of energy to report to the
committee in six months his recommendations for what the winning
state should pay.
   The amendments were offered to the $3.1 billion Energy
Department research authorization bill.
   As it stands, the bill would authorize $1.6 billion over the
next three years for the collider, of which $148 million would be
for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ but with no construction
funds until Oct. 1, 1989.
   The bill would set a limit of 25 percent on any foreign
contributions and require that no more than 33 percent of the
equipment be of foreign manufacture. The administration has said it
believes it can get foreign countries to contribute at least 25
percent of the cost. But so far there have been no foreign
commitments, and only Italy has agreed to explore collaboration.
   Several amendments to the bill remain to be considered,
including measures that would sharply reduce the super collider
authorization or eliminate it altogether, and to make a 25 percent
foreign contribution a requirement for proceeding with the giant
atom smasher.
   The department sought $363 million for the new fiscal year, a
large part of it to begin construction after site selection. That
selection is to be made in November and confirmed in January.
   Since the department actually needs no authorization and could
proceed under its general authority to conduct scientific research,
the bill would be important for the collider only as a statement of
congressional intent and limit on later appropriations, which the
department does have to have.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., chairman of the House Appropriations
energy subcommittee, has told the Illinois delegation his panel
will approve no more than $60 million.
   Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee, Colorado, Arizona
and Texas are finalists to host the super collider, which comprises
a 53 miles-around tunnel and associated experimental facilities for
smashing beams of protons into each other at energies 20 times the
maximum possible today.
   Current law forbids the states from offering cash contributions
during the selection process. The Energy Department is insisting on
donation of the land, and the states may undertake site
improvements _ which may be substantial.
   Illinois officials figure the state's land purchase, tunneling,
road and other work is worth $590 million, and several states have
submitted sealed bids that are to be opened only if that state is
chosen.
   Before the vote on Packard's amendment, Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr.,
R-N.M., said Tennessee officials had claimed they would have to
drop out of the competition if a minimum-funds requirement were
imposed.
   Others were skeptical that a $500 million requirement would
deter anyone. ``Whoever wins ... is winning a $50 billion economic
development program,'' said the chairman, Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J.

   The House overwhelmingly turned down attempts
Friday to order U.S. troops brought home from Western Europe and
Japan unless America's allies spend more for defense.
   The decisions came as the chamber worked its way through a bill
authorizing the Pentagon budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   First, the chamber rejected, 240-120, a proposal by Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas, to bring 30,000 troops a year back from Europe,
and 7,000 troops annually from Japan, starting in 1991.
   Then, a 332-21 vote shot down an amendment by Rep. Tommy
Robinson, D-Ark., to withdraw 70,000 troops a year from Europe.
   Moments later, the House voted 359-0 approval of a proposal
saying the Reagan administration should begin talks with U.S.
allies about defense burden-sharing. A similar call was approved by
Congress last year, but the proposal is not binding and only
suggests that the negotiations should start.
   Both Bryant and Robinson tied their reduction requirements to
demands that Japan and the other 15 North Atlantic Treaty
Organization nations should spend a bigger portion of their budgets
for alliance defense.
   The House votes came as the Pentagon released its annual
assessment, mandated by Congress, on ``Allied Contributions to the
Common Defense.''
   The report was accompanied by a personal pledge from Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci ``to press at every opportunity for
progress in improving allied defense capabilities and in sharing
equitably the roles, risks and burdens of the alliance.''
   Carlucci said U.S. allies ``make a substantial contribution to
the common defense _ considerably more than they are often given
credit for.'' But, he said the United States ``in some areas is
doing more than most of its partners.''
   ``What is very clear is that there are substantial variations in
performance among individual allies,'' Carlucci said.
   The report says that in 1986, the latest year for which complete
figures are available, the United States allocated 6.8 percent of
its gross national product to defense.
   Greece, which ranked second among the allies, allocated 6.1
percent. England was third with 5.1 percent, followed by Turkey at
4.8 percent and France at 3.9 percent. The remaining nations had
shares of 3.2 percent or less.
   Legislators in both the House and Senate have repeatedly
criticized NATO nations for not doing more. But they have rejected
several attempts in the past three years to order U.S. force
reductions in Europe, where 326,000 U.S. troops are stationed, and
in Japan, where there are about 63,000 American service personnel.
   ``Let's get smart and begin to tell our allies that we expect
them to pay their fair share,'' said Bryant. ``We are subsidizing
their defense.''
   Robinson was even more blunt. ``The real purpose of this
amendment is to demonstrate to our allies that we've had it. These
people are stealing our jobs because we have been suckered into
paying for their defense.''
   But Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., called Robinson's plan ``a
dangerous and irresponsible effort to bring troops home to deal
with the (U.S.) trade problem.''
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., opposed both plans, saying, ``this
would be entirely counter-productive ... it is simply not possible
to maintain the viability of a voluntary alliance of free countries
if one of those countries tries to impose standards on the others.''
   Rep. Douglas Bereuter, R-Neb., said, ``this would send the wrong
message'' at a time when the United States is trying to urge NATO
countries to spend more for non-nuclear weapons in the wake of the
U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear weapons.
   But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said, ``it's time Uncle Sam quit
being taken for uncle sucker.''
   The bill authorizes Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion in the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which is the same amount proposed by
the separate bill that will be considered next month by the Senate.
   Differences between the bills that pass each chamber will
eventually be reconciled by a House-Senate conference committee.

   A man whose first name is John mounted his third
annual protest Friday and called on Johns of the world to wrest
their good names away from toilets, customers of prostitutes and
John Doe anonymity.
   John Brooks, armed with a well-thumbed paperback dictionary and
a battered sign proclaiming April 29 ``National John Day,'' stood
on a windy downtown corner, seeking to draw attention to his claims
that the proper name of John has been abused.
   ``I'm defending the name John,'' he yelled, drawing amused
stares from lunchtime crowds.
   Brooks, 45, freely admits there's nothing official about his
cause and doesn't expect to make a name for himself with the annual
protests, which he said would stop after this year. But he says
years of name-calling prompted him to take action.
   ``A major complaint, in the dictionary, is John being used as a
prostitute's client or a toilet,'' he said. ``It makes a swear word
out of our name, doesn't it?''
   He said the seedy first definition isn't even accurate.
   ``Over the last year also, the Johns aren't the ones (who've)
been seeing the prostitutes. The customers (have been) Jimmies,''
Brooks said, making an oblique reference to recent television
evangelist scandals.
   Brooks also is upset about ``putting John Doe on the toes of
people who've died and they don't know who he is.''
   As part of his efforts, Brooks, a self-employed carpenter in
Dallas, has created a fictitious lawsuit against society, seeking
$12.5 trillion. Restitution could be handled by giving all Johns
the day off on April 29, a date he said he picked for no particular
reason.
   At least one John who joined Brooks' demonstration said he took
advantage of that idea: John Malmqvist, 20, a carpet technician,
said he talked his boss into giving him a half-day off.
   Malmqvist said he's also irked at the way ``John'' is used in
hypothetical situations such as ``Why Johnny Can't Read.''
   ``If you're in school, they always use Johnny for this, Johnny
for that. When they're giving examples over the speakers, talking
about bad kids, they always say, `Well, Johnny went home and did
this and that ...'''
   Passer-by Bobby Mullins, 22, said he sympathized with the Johns'
plight, although he didn't expect to stop using John as a generic
term.
   ``I probably still will, but I'll think about that guy over
there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ag Department Says Trees Being Planting at Healthy Pace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tree-planting in the United States hasn't gone
to the dogs, by any means, an Agriculture Department report showed
Friday.
   Last year more than 3 million acres were reforested with 2.3
billion tree seedlings, an area about the size of Connecticut,
Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson said.
   About 87 percent of the 1987 tree plantings was on private
lands, mostly in the South, he said.
   More than 1 million acres of the seeding involved land enrolled
in the department's Conservation Reserve Program authorized in the
1985 farm law, he said. Under the program, farmers get federal aid
to plant trees or grass to protect highly erodible land, plus
annual rental payments for 10 years to keep the land out of crop
production.
   Robertson said tree planting has set annual records since 1981
when more than 2.37 million acres were reforested.
   By comparison, he said, the Civilian Conservation Corps planted
about 2.33 million acres in trees over a 10-year period in the
1930s and early 1940s. More than 2 million acres were planted under
the Soil Bank program in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

<HEAD>Ax-Wielding Rapist Reportedly Visited Tampa-Area Relative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawrence Singleton, the convicted
rapist-mutilator who was the target of protests from towns
mentioned as possible homes after his parole last year, visited
Tampa area relatives earlier this week, authorities said Friday.
   Sheriff's Maj. John Cacciatore said a relative of the
60-year-old Tampa native told him Thursday by telephone that
Singleton paid a short visit earlier this week and left.
   ``I don't know where's he's gone,'' Cacciatore said. ``It's not
that we're not concerned. We just don't know.''
   He was convicted in California of raping a 15-year-old
hitchhiker in 1978, then chopping off her forearms with an ax and
leaving her to die. He served eight years of a 14-year sentence,
getting out early for participating in a prison work-credit program.
   His presence in Tampa was unpublicized and provoked no outcry.
Officials have said that obscurity is probably the best approach he
can take to try to offset public resentment.
   Officials said they were unsure if Singleton was still in the
state. One of eight siblings raised in the Tampa area, Singleton
has other relatives in Florida.
   Singleton's parole officially ended Monday, so he no longer is
required to tell officials where he goes or settles, according to
Bob Gore of the California Department of Corrections.
   Controversy has dogged the former merchant seaman since his
release last year. Outraged Californians mounted campaigns when
their communites were mentioned as possible homes during his
year-long parole.
   He spent weeks being shuttled among apartments and motels along
the California coast and wound up in a mobile home on the grounds
of San Quentin Prison until the parole expired.

<HEAD>Tower Tape Reveals Cool Heads Prevailed During April 15 Crash At
Sea-Tac</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The crew of a Horizon Air commuter plane and
controllers at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport remained cool
even as the aircraft caught fire and made a crash-landing, a tape
released Friday showed.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials praised the calm
response of pilot Carl Carlson and co-pilot Mark Hilstead to the
April 15 emergency. They also singled out the work of Steve
Boniberger, a controller for seven years who was working his second
day at Sea-Tac since transferring from New York's La Guardia
Airport.
   ``Our people performed outstanding ... above and beyond the call
of duty,'' said Wes Hamilton, an FAA official and manager of the
Sea-Tac tower.
   The plane touched down safely but then went out of control,
ramming three passenger boarding ramps before coming to rest just
feet in front of a passenger concourse. All 40 people aboard
survived. Nineteen were injured and two remain hospitalized in
stable condition.
   The tape of conversation between the de Havilland Dash 8 and
Sea-Tac controllers was played for reporters at the control tower
Friday.
   ``We're going to have to return to the airport,'' said a calm,
measured voice from the cockpit of Flight 2658 about a minute after
its takeoff on a scheduled trip to Spokane. The plane was less than
three miles from the airport.
   ``Do you have a problem?'' the tower asked.
   ``Yes,'' the Horizon crew responded. ``... Reduced power in the
right engine.''
   The tower noted that the Horizon commuter had not officially
declared an emergency and asked, ``Do you want (emergency safety)
equipment?''
   ``Yes,'' the crew replied, adding that the plane was carrying 40
people and 2,800 pounds of fuel.
   FAA officials did not identify which crew member made each
comment.
   Controllers then warned other aircraft on the ground to stay
clear of the runway.
   As the Horizon plane made its approach, Boniberger reported
seeing a puff of white smoke come from the right engine.
   Then a voice from another airplane broke into the tape: ``You've
got a fire going on that airplane.'' The voice said the fire was in
the right engine.
   ``From then on we knew it was something serious,'' Hamilton said
Friday.
   After touchdown, the plane veered toward the airport terminal
and the cockpit crew said the craft was ``out of control ...
leaving the runway.''
   The controller then shouted urgently, ``He's out of control .. .
he's out of control.'' It was the most excited response of the
five-minute incident and came seconds before the plane crashed into
the passenger ramps.
   The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board expect their
investigation into the crash to take at least a month.

<HEAD>Strong Thunderstorms Across Texas, Heavy Rain In New England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms battered parts of Texas on Friday, with at
least one tornado, and parts of New England had rain heavy enough
to flood highways. Sections of the drty Northwest also got rain,
with snow at higher elevations.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widespread across central and
southeastern Texas during the morning, some accompanied by brief
heavy rain and hail. Thunderstorms also extended north into parts
of Oklahoma and Kansas.
   A tornado destroyed a building and damaged trees during the
afternoon near Columbus, Texas, in Colorado County, but no injuries
were reported, the National Weather Service reported.
   Thunderstorms produced hail three-quarters of an inch in
diameter in Texas' Colorado County and Bexar County, and knocked
power out at Rock Island, Texas.
   A thunderstorm dropped a quarter of an inch of rain in just five
minutes at Fort Worth, Texas.
   Galveston, Texas, got 1.62 inches of rain in the six hours up to
2 p.m. EDT, and 1.13 inches fell in the same period at Bergstrom
Air Force Base near Austin.
   Showers and isolated thunderstorms were numerous across the
Northeast, with rain extending from western Pennsylvania and New
York state through Maine.
   In the 24 hours up to 8 a.m. EDT, rainfall amounts included 4.40
inches at North Conway, N.H.; 4.15 inches at Pinkham Notch, N.H.;
3.43 inches at Rochester, Vt.; 3.41 inches at Berlin, N.H.; and
3.40 inches at Lincoln and Ludlow, Vt.
   Some northern New Hampshire highways were blocked by high water,
police reported.
   Rain was scattered across the Pacific Northwest with showers
extending from western Washington and Oregon into northern
California. Showers and a few thunderstorms spread across much of
northern Idaho.
   Up to 6 inches of snow was expected by morning in the passes of
the Oregon Cascades.
   Temperatures pushed into the 60s and 70s across the upper
Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes, but chilly air moved
along the central and southern Appalachians and a frost warning was
issued overnight. A frost warning also was issued for much of South
Carolina.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Du Bois, Pa., to 89 at Harlingen and Kingsville, Texas.
The low for the day was 24 degrees at Hibbing, Minn., and
Marshfield, Wis.
   For Saturday, numerous showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the lower Mississippi Valley through the Gulf Coast region,
with showers widespread from the eastern Great Lakes through New
England. Widespread showers also were forecast across the northern
Pacific Coast and the northern Rockies.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted from the Pacific Northwest into
northern sections of the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah,
and from the upper Ohio Valley into New England; in the 80s across
New Mexico into western and southwest Texas, plus the southern half
of Florida; in the mid 90s over the Arizona deserts; and in the 60s
or 70s across much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Peace Conference Will Consider Angola and South-West Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A conference next week will bring the United
States, Angola, Cuba and South Africa together for the first time
to discuss troop withdrawals from Angola and independence for
South-West Africa, the government said Friday.
   The conference, to be held Tuesday and Wednesday at a secret
London location, follows intense diplomatic activity aimed at
ending the 13-year-old Angolan civil war and achieving independence
for neighboring South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, which is
controlled by by South Africa.
   Announcement of the talks by the Foreign Office followed a
meeting Friday between Anatoly Adamishin, a Soviet deputy foreign
minister, and Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state
for African affairs.
   U.S. officials said Crocker would lead the U.S. delegation to
the talks but the delegates of the other nations were not
identified. A statement from South Africa's Foreign Ministry said
none of its representatives would have Cabinet rank.
   Adamishin told a news conference the Soviet Union, although not
a participant at the meeting, supports the ``political dynamism''
that led to the new attempt at a political settlement in southern
Africa.
   The United States seeks a timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000
Cuban military personnel in Angola. Angola and the Soviet Union
want South Africa to withdraw its forces from Namibia and comply
with a 1966 United Nations demand to give it independence.
   Angola's Marxist government, with Cuban help and Soviet backing,
is fighting rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, which is supported by South Africa and the
United States.
   Previous efforts at a settlement have stalled, in part because
of U.S. support for South Africa's demand that the Cuban troops
leave before it gives independence to Namibia.
   South Africa captured the mineral-rich territory from Germany in
World War I and controls it under a League of Nations mandate
abrogated by the United Nations in 1966. The South-West Africa
People's Organization, which has bases in southern Angola, is
fighting a guerrilla war for independence for the territory.
   The Angolan government has refused to talk directly with UNITA
and the rebels are not included in the London conference. Adamishin
said the Soviets and Angolans consider UNITA ``like an arm of South
Africa.''
   In its statement announcing the meeting, the Foreign Office
said: ``Discussions between the United States, Angola, South Africa
and Cuba, on troop withdrawal from Angola and independence for
Namibia, will take place on May 3 and 4 in Britain.
   ``We are pleased to have facilitated and welcome this further
step in the negotiating process.''
   In Cape Town, South Africa, Foreign Minister R. F. Botha said:
``As far as South Africa is concerned, the talks are going to be
about Cuban withdrawal from Angola and it will be useful if
representatives of the Cuban government could be present.'' He did
not elaborate.
   Botha said the talks could collapse if Angola seeks
implementation of a U.N. resolution condemning South Africa for
having troops in southern Angola. In December, the U.N. Security
Council voted to demand withdrawal of South African troops.
   Angola claims South Africa has 9,000 soldiers with heavy
artillery on its territory but South Africa says it has not had
more than 3,000 men there at one time since May 1987.

<HEAD>Labor Unrest Spreads After Nigerian Price Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Minister Abubakar Umar met with
leaders of 22 unions Friday as labor unrest spread throughout
Nigeria following a rise in the price of gasoline, Lagos radio
reported.
   It said the union officials asked the government of President
Ibrahim Babangida to reconsider the gasoline price increase, to
lower prices for food and other basic commodities, to raise
salaries and to release labor leaders detained since a series of
strikes began about two weeks ago.
   The broadcast said other representatives of Nigeria's 42 trade
unions did not show up for the meeting, including those
representing striking civil service and bank workers.
   On April 10, the government raised gasoline and diesel fuel
prices by 3 percent and that was expected to be the first of a
series of price increases. The action followed recommendations by
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to increase
petroleum prices to help cut Nigeria's $1.5-billion deficit.
   Since the oil-boom days of the mid-1970's, Nigerians have
regarded cheap gasoline as one of their rights. Even with the
increases Nigerian gas sells for about 40 cents a gallon.
   Many Lagos banks remained closed for the second day and others
operated with skeleton crews because of striking workers, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported. Banks in Kano, Makurdi, Calabar and
Ibadan also were affected.
   Planes were grounded throughout Nigeria for most of Friday when
air traffic controllers joined the strike.
   Aviation Minister Anthony Okpere later reopened the Lagos
international airport and denied any strike took place. He blamed
the closure on saboteurs who he said ``disrupted the function'' of
control tower equipment.
   Medical and health workers in Lagos walked off the job Friday,
the news agency said.
   Six people were killed in April 13 riots that began as a protest
by university students and led to the government's closing more
than 20 colleges and universities.
   Labor unions then joined in the protests.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said Friday
that Democrat Michael Dukakis is more concerned about ``pink slips
and plant closings'' than creating new jobs.
   He also said Dukakis waffled on whether to support President
Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iran in the Persian Gulf, and
he accused both Dukakis and Jesse Jackson of being soft on
penalties for drug-pushers.
   He defended Reagan administration efforts to cut off the supply
of drugs, but told reporters, ``I'm taking a look now at changing
the whole structure of how the government is set up'' to wage the
drug fight.
   Bush defended Reagan's opposition to the trade bill that would
force factories to give workers advance notice of closings.
Referring to Reagan's threat of a veto, he said, ``It will get
one.''
   The vice president, after touring a Magnavox plant that makes
radios and other gear for the military, said notices of plant
closings should be left to management and labor unions to work out,
not Congress.
   Advance notice does not protect jobs, he said. ``All that does
is guarantee misery. ... I'm for plant openings.''
   Dukakis had challenged Bush to spell out whether he opposes the
trade bill, the product of two years of bipartisan work in Congress.
   At a breakfast for 325 GOP supporters here, Bush said that while
the Massachusetts governor ``is talking about pink slips and plant
closings, I want to talk about the fact that ... there are more
Americans at work than any time in the history of the country.''
   ``There's some big drug problems in this country. I hear a lot
of campaign rhetoric. I hear both Jackson and Dukakis assailing the
administration on this and thus denigrating those men and women in
the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) ... trying to staunch the
flow of drugs coming in and catch the criminals,' he said.
   ``But I haven't heard them talk about how tough they want to be
in changing the laws ... (to) put some muscle in,'' he said. ``I
strongly favor the death penalty for the narco-traffickers, those
kingpins that are pushing the poison on our kids.''
   The certain Republican nominee said front-runner Dukakis was
``waffling all over the field'' on whether to support Reagan's
strike against Iranian oil platforms and boats after a mine nearly
sank a U.S. Navy frigate. It took the Massachusetts governor most
of a day to formulate a response to the strike earlier this month.
   ``The president's different than anything else. You can't wait
around, hold your finger in the wind and see what the polls show,''
he said.
   Bush told the Magnavox workers, ``We can compete. Let's remember
who we are. We're the United States of America. We rolled back the
frontiers and battled the deserts and the shows.''
   Bush, in interviews with local reporters, said he is girding for
a close race in the fall. `I think I have to get my message out, my
passions, what my heartbeat is,'' he said.
   Asked whether Attorney General Edwin Meese III should resign
because of on-going investigations into his activities, Bush said,
``Let the system work it out. ... Let the system make that
deterrmination.''
   Asked if he would hire Meese in his administration, Bush said,
``If he proves innocent, I certainly would hire him.''
   But he said that was a theoretical question. ``We're going to
have change, new people'' in the entire Cabinet, he said.
   In Indianapolis, Bush told reporters ``we will have some fun,
too,'' if the Democrats try to taint him with the so-called sleaze
factor, a reference to alleged wrongdoing by high-ranking Reagan
administration officials.
   Bush, asked if he was hurt by Meese's problems, said, ``I think
Democrats are fair. I know the Democrats. I hear them talking about
it. But there is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a
guilt-by-association mode where we can find in Massachusetts
politics or campaign staff or things of that nature. I hope we
don't have to do it.''
   He added, ``We will have some fun, too, trying to look into what
is going on in Illinois or Massachusetts depending upon which one
wins the Democratic nomination. You know we've got some cannon
fodder, if you want to get into that.''
   Leslie Dach, a spokesman for Dukakis, responded, ``I guess his
support for Ed Meese is making the vice president nervous. The vice
president knows that the vast majority of Americans have serious
questions about his commitment to ethics in government.''

<HEAD>Bill Requires Drug-Free Workplaces for Energy Department
Contractors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee voted Friday to permit the
Energy Department to withhold payments to some of its contractors
until they demonstrate they are trying to maintain drug-free
workplaces.
   The measure was attached as an amendment to the $3.1 billion
Energy Department research authorization bill being considered by
the House Space, Science and Technology Committee.
   Approval came on a 20-7 show of hands.
   Opponents said the amendment likely would prove to be
counterproductive and inappropriate. Rep. Jimmy Hayes, D-La., a
former prosecutor, said if he were a contractor, he would defend
arrested employees in court to avoid interruption of his income
from the department.
   Supporters said it was time for Congress to get serious about
the nation's drug problem.
   ``Have any hearings been held?'' said Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y.
   ``We have had hearings,'' said Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas.
``Hearings are going on right now in the juvenile courts, in the
jails and in the cemeteries.''
   Walker's provision would require all contracts authorized under
the bill to contain a provision permitting the contracting agency _
most often the Energy Department _ to withhold payments ``upon
proof of use, possession or possession with the intent to
distribute of any controlled substance in violation of any federal,
state or local law, by an employee in the workplace, as evidenced
by the conviction of such employee in a court of competent
jurisdiction'' until the contractor ``demonstrates to the agency
that it has taken sufficient action to restore a drug-free
workplace.''
   Convictions arising out of an employer's good-faith efforts to
enforce a drug-free workplace ``shall be considered substantial
evidence that the employer is taking sufficient action,'' Walker's
amendment said.
   Jeff Sherwood, spokesman for the Energy Department, said he was
unable to reach any officials in a position to comment.
   The Energy Department provides funds to universities and others
that operate laboratories which undertake a wide variety of
research, ranging from the most secret nuclear weapons to
environmental projects.
   Prospects for the drug provisions were not immediately clear,
since the science authorization bill for the department has failed
to get through Congress for the past severl years.
   The department has permanent, general authority to conduct
scientific research, and does so with money provided by
appropriations committees.

   A Nicaraguan airliner with 23 people
aboard made an emergency landing Friday in San Jose after a window
blew out at 20,000 feet, an airport controller said.
   No injuries were reported among the 16 passengers and seven crew
members.
   The Aeronica Boeing 720 left San Jose for Panama at 8:15 a.m.
(10:15 a.m. EDT) and was over Costa Rica's Caribbean port of Limon
when a window blew out in the left forward part of the aircraft,
said the controller, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The pilot advised us that the plane was losing pressure and
would return to Santamaria airport,'' he said. ``About 15 minutes .
.. (after takeoff) the plane landed without problems.''
   It had left Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, at 7 a.m. (9 a.m.
EDT).
   The flight was canceled and an investigation begun, the
controller said.
   Costa Rica's 39 regular air traffic controllers have been on
strike for eight days demanding higher pay and and equipment
improvements. The source was one of 11 substitutes.

   President Reagan said Friday he will continue
to apply economic sanctions against Nicaragua to counter the
``unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and
foreign policy of the United States'' posed by its Sandinista
regime.
   In a semi-annual report required by law, Reagan said trade
sanctions ``complement the diplomatic and other aspects of our
policy toward Nicaragua.''
   ``The policies and actions of the government of Nicaragua
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States,'' he
said. ``I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to
apply economic sanctions against Nicaragua as long as these

   The crippled submarine USS Bonefish was
towed into its home port Friday, five days after a fire and
explosion rocked the vessel off the Florida coast and killed three
crewmen.
   The Bonefish, assisted by four tugboats, tied up next to the USS
Frank Cable, a submarine auxiliary ship, at the Charleston Naval
Base at midafternoon.
   Three crewmen were killed and 22 others from the 92-man Bonefish
crew were injured in Sunday's fire. Lt. Cmdr. John Tull, a
spokesman for the Charleston Naval Base, said an investigation of
the accident is continuing.
   Several sailors from the Bonefish in white Navy uniforms stood
on top of the sub as it was towed up the Cooper River toward the
base. The crews of the Cable and the nearby guided missile
destroyer USS MacDonough stood at attention as the Bonefish, an
American flag flying from its conning tower, tied up.
   The sailors went out to meet the submarine at the harbor
entrance when the tugs took the Bonefish from the salvage ship USS
Hoist, which had towed the sub for two days from the site of the
accident.
   Tull said the investigation will be headed by Capt. Robin White,
the commander of the Charleston-based Submarine Squadron 18. No
deadline exists for completing the probe, he said, adding, ``You
take as long as you need to thoroughly investigate it.''
   Ronald Larsen, the chief electrician's mate on the Bonefish, had
told The Associated Press that most of the crew members believe the
ship won't be returned to service.
   But Tull said there's been no decision on what will be done with
the 30-year-old submarine, which is one of the Navy's last
remaining diesel-electric submarines.
   ``That will have to be evaluated,'' said Tull.
   Meanwhile, Tull said, three doctors from the Portsmouth Naval
Hospital in Virginia are in Charleston to counsel Bonefish crewmen.
   The accident killed Lt. Ray Everts, 30, of Naoma, W.Va.; Petty
Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr., 39, of Willis, Texas; and
Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren, 21, of Pisgah Forest,
N.C. The three bodies were recovered from the sub Wednesday and
Thursday.
   The funeral for Bordelon will be held Saturday, and the funerals
for the other two victims will be held Sunday. A memorial service
for all three is scheduled Saturday at a church in downtown
Charleston.

   Soviet television began broadcasting in the
Armenian language Friday to Nagorno-Karabakh, the territory that
has caused conflict in the neighboring Caucasus republics of
Azerbaijan and Armenia, Tass reported.
   The broadcasts are part of the government's eight-year plan to
improve the cultural and economic life of Nagorno-Karabakh, which
has a predominantly Armenian population but was assigned to
Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Last month, the government refused demands by Armenia and
demonstrators in Nagorno-Karabakh that the area be annexed to
Armenia.
   Demonstrations began in mid-February in Armenia and Azerbaijan,
and riots began Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait.
   At least 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis were killed in three
days of violence and about 200 people were hurt, officials reported.
   Nagorno-Karabakh now receives the Armenian-lanaguage programming
on one channel in addition to two national channels broadcasting in
Russian and one in Azerbaijani, the official news agency said.

<HEAD>Over 500 Vehicles Seized In Latest Drug Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Customs Service said Friday it has seized
over 500 vehicles, ranging from 18-wheelers to boats, from people
caught carrying drugs into the country in the last five weeks.
   The new confiscation policy is part of the Reagan
administration's ``Zero Tolerance'' anti-drug strategy announced
last month.
   People caught bringing drugs into the country are arrested,
their passport seized as evidence and the vehicle used to transport
the drugs or drug paraphernalia is seized.
   In one instance, agents seized a $120,000 18-wheel
tractor-trailer because the driver was carrying a single marijuana
joint.
   ``If he's the owner of the truck, it's gone, he probably won't
get it back,'' said Michael Lane, the No. 2 Customs Service
official, in an interview.
   In most cases, the government will have the vehicles sold at
auction and the proceeds will go into the Treasury.
   If the driver caught carring drugs isn't the owner, the vehicle
will be turned over to the owner for a price that includes paying
the Customs Service's costs involved in confiscating the vehicle.
   ``There's no question that Zero Tolerance is working,'' Customs
commissioner William von Raab said in a statement. ``The message is
simple. We cannot tolerate any drugs in our society, and if you get
caught, you will be punished.''
   A total of 542 cars, trucks, tractor-trailers and boats had been
seized as of Tuesday under the new program. Four boats were seized
in Alaska and four in Miami.
   ``We hope the reaction is that they're shocked into reality,''
Lane said. ``Their cars are being taken away, they're being
fingerprinted, photographed, taken before a magistrate and charged
with an offense. We've had a lot of positive reaction from local
communities.''
   Federal criminal law allows the Customs Service to seize and
dispose of vehicles involved in transporting drugs into the country.
   Some legal experts have criticized the portion of the policy
that calls for seizing passports. They question the
constitutionality of restricting a person's freedom to travel
before the person has been convicted of a crime.

   Officials on Friday denied reports of
an agreement with the Reagan administration that would have Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega quit as commander of the military but not
leave Panama.
   An estimated 10,000 people marched Friday in a demonstration of
support of Noriega, the head of Panamaa's 15,000-member Defense
Forces and the dominant force in the civilian government.
   ``That agreement does not exist,'' Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter
told a news conference. ``You can hardly reach an agreement when
relations with the United States are at the point they are.''
   Ritter confirmed that Michael Kozak, an aide to Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, met with Noriega this week.
   ``Mr. Kozak was in Panama talking with different groups, with
leaders of the opposition,'' Ritter said. ``He also talked with the
general but did not reach any agreement, because they simply were
not negotiating.''
   Noriega was indicted in Florida in February on drug trafficking
charges. The United States subsequently demanded he resign from the
military and imposed economic sanctions on Panama. Noriega has
denied the narcoatics allegations.
   Government officials said privately the proposal on Noriega
quitting was a ``face-saving move by the United States.'' They said
Noriega has already offered to resign subject to the establishment
of a ``national dialogue'' with opposition forces.
   Opposition leaders were not immediately available for comment.
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader of the anti-Noriega
forces in Washington, accused the United States of going beyond its
authority in trying to negotiate Panama's political future.
   In Miami, anti-Noriega exiles called the U.S. proposal a
surrender with cosmetics.
   ``This cosmetic solution will only take the country down the
road to disaster,'' said Gilberto Mallol, exiled representative of
the Panamanian opposition umbrella group, the Civic Crusade.
   A U.S. official said in Washington Friday that the Reagan
administration reached a tentative agreement with Noriega under
which he will step down as chief of the Defense Forces and de facto
leader of the government but remain in Panama.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kozak met
with Noriega this week. But he said the agreement was ``less than
ideal'' because it did not include the general's departure from the
country.
   The march Friday was called by the Popular Unity Front, which
includes some labor groups that support the government and some
parties in the governing coalition.
   One of the speakers at the rally, Alvaro Munoz of the National
Council of Workers, said: ``The problem of Noriega must be solved
through an agreement among Panamanians and within the laws of the
Defense Forces.''
   Noriega in mid-March offered to resign as commander of the
Defense Forces before the May 1989 elections.
   Panama is suffering a cash shortage because of the U.S. santions.
   The Reagan administration has refused to make scheduled payments
to Panama for Panama Canal operations. It also has set up accounts
in the United States under the name of ousted President Eric Arturo
Delvalle for tax and other payments by Americans and American
companies to this country.
   Washington continues to recognize Delvalle, who was deposed by
pro-Noriega legislators on Feb. 26, a day after he tried to fire
the general. But opposition leaders have said they will not
recognize Delvalle if Noriega leaves.
   Noriega has said the U.S. actions are the result of his refusal
to help the Reagan administration overthrow Nicaragua's leftist
government and of efforts by rightists in the the United States to
prevent the scheduled turnover of the Panama Canal to Panama at the
end of 1999.

<TEXT>
   The legal requirements for using an
unprecedented volume of government secrets in court will deprive
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and three Iran-Contra co-defendants
of a fair trial, the defense said Friday.
   Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) requirements that
the defense serve notice of any plans to disclose classified
information in court will give the prosecution an unfair advantage,
the defense said in a motion filed in U.S. District Court.
   The requirement ``imposes burdens on the defense unprecedented
in American criminal law,'' lawyers for the fired National Security
Council aide and his three co-defendants said in a joint motion.
   ``In the circumstances of this singular case involving an
unprecedented volume of classified documents'' the requirement is
``clearly unconstitutional,'' the defense said.
   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter,
busisinessmen Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
V. Secord are accused of conspiring to defraud the governent by
diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   Under the law, the defense would be barred from using classified
evidence in the trial unless it notifies the prosecution before the
trial of all government secrets it plans to disclose.
   The requirement ``forces the defendants to furnish the
prosecution virtually every detail of the defense case, including
the defendants' anticipated testimony at trial, the testimony of
other defense witnesses'' and the contents of all classified
documents the lawyers intend to introduce as evidence or use to
cross-examine prosecution witnesses, the defense said.
   ``This sweeping notice requirement ... violates the defendants'
fundamental constitutional rights, including such basic guarantees
as the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, the right to
effective assistance of counsel, the right to cross-examine adverse
witnesses and the right to due process of law,'' the defense said.
   The requirement also deprives the defendants of the right to
decide during the trial whether they want to testify in their own
defense.
   ``If the defendants do not include the substance of their
anticipated testimony in their notice, then they run a grave risk
that the court will preclude large portions of their testimony,''
the defense said.
   ``On the other hand, the defense lacks the information necessary
to make an informed decision that the defendants will testify,
since the defense does not know how the prosecution's case will
fare at any trial,'' the brief said.
   The problem is particularly acute because the indictment, as
described by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, ``alleges a
course of conduct carried out using classified materials in
classified channels from a highly classified site.''
   The difficulty is compounded by the large volume of documents.
Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has said as many as 50,000
pages of classified documents collected during his investigation
are relevant to the case.
   And Gesell has ruled that the defense should have an opportunity
to examine relevant portions of another 250,000 pages.
   ``The defense can reasonably predict that hundreds of thousands
of pages of classified material not yet inventoried, and volumes of
classified testimony, will ultimately be involved in the case,''
said the joint motion by lawyers for the four defendants.
   The defense motion illustrated the difficulty of applying the
disclosure rule to cross-examination.
   ``Armed with the defendant's notice,'' Walsh can tailor his case
``to blunt the force of the defense cross-examination. The notice
may alert the prosecution to specific areas of vulnerability of
which it had been not aware.''

<TEXT>
   The guided-missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts,
badly ripped by a mine in the Persian Gulf two weeks ago, will be
repaired at the shipyards of the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine,
the Navy announced Friday.
   The service said a damage assessment of the ship was still under
way in the United Arab Emirates port of Dubai, where the Roberts
was towed after the April 14 mining. No estimate could be made as
to when the frigate could sail for the United States.
   But the service said the Bath Iron Works had been selected to
make repairs ``because of its proximity to Newport, R.I., the home
port of the ship, and because the shipyard has both the capability
and capacity for doing the restoration.''
   ``The Samuel B. Roberts was built at Bath and was commissioned
there in April 1986,'' the Navy said in a statement. ``The cost of
the repairs has not yet been determined, and will not be known
until a full assessment can be made of the damage.''
   The Navy said no decision had been made on whether temporary
repairs could be performed in Dubai that would allow the ship to
steam home on its own power. A Navy source said, however, the
damage to the vessel was so severe that it ``almost certainly''
would have to be towed.
   Navy officials have said the Roberts almost certainly would have
sunk had it not been for the performance of its crew.

   Thousands of workers struck for higher pay
at a heavy machinery plant Friday, capping a week of Poland's worst
labor trouble since communist authorities suppressed the Solidarity
union more than six years ago.
   Warsaw police detained Jacek Kuron, a senior adviser to the
outlawed Solidarity federation. A member of Kuron's household said
three plainclothesmen arrived at his home in Warsaw as Kuron was
being interviewed by telephone by a Western radio station.
   Strikes began Monday with bus and streetcar drivers leaving
their jobs in the western city of Bydgoszcz. Workers at the huge
Lenin steel works at Nowa Huta, outside Krakow in the southern
industrial belt, struck Tuesday and on Friday came the strike at
the machinery plant at Stalowa Wola, 65 miles east of Krakow.
   Solidarity activists in Krakow's municipal transport company
said in a statement they were calling a strike for 6 a.m. Saturday
to support the Nowa Huta action.
   Workers demand pay increases of 50 percent or more. Prices rose
42 percent in the first three months of 1988 because the government
reduced subsidies on many consumer items.
   Sunday is May Day, the international Labor Day traditionally
celebrated by the government and used by Polish workers to air
their grievances publicly. Streets were festooned in advance with
red Communist Party banners, red-and-white Polish flags and posters
saying ``Workers of All Lands Unite.''
   The government has both threatened dismissals and promised to
improve wages. At Bydgoszcz, the 2,800 drivers won a 60 percent pay
increase ater an 11-hour strike.
   Officials of Solidarity threatened more strikes if authorities
use force against strikers. They said workers in at least four
other cities had declared support for the Nowa Huta action and
issued strike alerts.
   Lech Walesa, Solidarity's founder, said in a statement: ``I
appeal to authorities to maintain reason. I am warning against the
return to the policy of terror, which is apparently supposed to
defend reforms, while in reality it defends the way of governing
which has led Poland to ruin.''
   He said statements by government officials indicated they might
use force and urged Poland's workers ``to show solidarity'' with
the strikers ``in case violence takes place.''
   An aide read the statement by telephone from Walesa's apartment
in Gdansk, where the 1983 Nobel Peace laureate works as a shipyard
electrician. The aide, who asked that his name not be used, said
Walesa instructed regional Solidarity leaders to organize protests
and strikes if the government uses force.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said an attempt to start a
strike failed at the 18,000-worker Stalowa Wola heavy machinery
plant, but the official news agency PAP said later at least one
department was shut down.
   A Roman Catholic priest in Stalowa Wola, the Rev. Jan Niemiec,
said about 7,000 strikers were occupying three department and the
strike began when about 5,000 first-shift employees quit working.
He said management tried to lock out most of the second-shift
workers but some broke in.
   Niemiec said the number of strikers could be as high as 9,000,
but he could not confirm the figure. He said the information came
from a member of the strike committee.
   In Poland, strikers customarily go to their places of employment
but do not work. Often they hold meetings or pass out leaflets.
   About 12,000 workers were striking for a fourth day at the Lenin
plant in Nowa Huta, which means New Steel Mill and was built as a
model city in the 1950s just outside Krakow.
   Management representatives met with the plant's
government-sanctioned union but refused to deal with the unofficial
committee that claims to represent at least half the plant's 32,000
workers.
   The Nowa Huta strike is the biggfest in Poland since those that
swept the country after food price increases in 1980, bringing down
a government and giving birth to Solidarity. The independent union
federation was suppressed, then outlawed, after martial law was
declared in December 1981.
   Urban said there had been ``preventative detentions'' in Poland
this week, but did not say how many. Kuron, the Solidarity adviser,
said by telephone before his detention that 25 people had been
picked up around the country in the past two days.
   Bronislaw Geremek, an adviser to Walesa, said police stopped his
car Thursday in Stalowa Wola and detained him, Solidarity spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz and Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak. He
said Onyszkiewicz and Bujak remained in custody.
   Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Solidarity spokesman in Warsaw, said
many police were in Stalowa Wola and at least four Solidarity
activists were detained.
   Demands at Nowa Huta are representative: recognition of their
union rights, release of detained Solidarity activists and an
immediate 50 percent increase in monthly pay that averages the
equivalent of $105.
   The strike committee said it had sent a letter to Pope John Paul
II, who was Krakow's archbishop before becoming pope, that began:
``We address you with our words of devotion and respect. We are
sending those words from the place of our work and struggle for
decent payment.''

   U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt urged the
NATO allies Friday to do more for Western defense.
   ``Europeans must do more for and among themselves to contribute
to their own defense, in Europe and beyond,'' he told an American
Chamber of Commerce meeting in Hamburg.
   ``Europe's stake in the international arena is often equal to or
greater than that of the United States, for example in questions of
access to raw materials such as oil and international markets.''
   U.S. legislators have spoken in recent months of a growing
belief among Americans that Europeans do not contribute enough
toward Western defense.
   Rupert Scholz, who takes over as West German defense minister
next month, was quoted by the newspaper Die Welt as saying in an
interview: ``It is not a matter of money alone. It is ability and
performance as well.''
   He said West German and U.S. defense interests cannot not be
separated.

   The bunny suits are retired now _ some replaced
by pinstripes. But the women who found success in ears and
cottontails still love to lead a cheer for the bygone lifestyle.
   ``I think probably it is a lost era,'' said Sandi Meehan, 49, of
Manhattan, who joined other former bunnies planning a Saturday
night reunion. ``When someone says Playboy bunny, it brings images
of maybe Ziegfeld Follies `girls' or the Rockettes.''
   Mrs. Meehan, who worked at Playboy clubs from 1961 to 1974 and
recruited other women during ``bunny hunts,'' now invests in real
estate and owns a Manhattan bakery with another former bunny.
   Bunnydom, she said, gave her valuable training in business and
public relations.
   ``We (former bunnies) are very successful businesswomen and we
are not feminists,'' said Mrs. Meehan. ``Feminists are the ones who
attacked us. I don't think it's fair. I know so many successful
`girls' who came from Playboy.''
   One successful girl _ uh, woman _ invited to the reunion was Ms.
magazine founder Gloria Steinem, who once took a job as a bunny to
write an expose.
   Steinem won't attend the reunion, which will raise funds for
Cancer Care Inc. ``When we have a dinner where former bunnies feel
able to tell the truth, it will make a lot more money. And then
I'll come,'' she said.
   But perhaps the feminist leader could strike a common chord with
ex-bunny Anna Lederer, 37, who left her native Trinidad at 17
because ``they thought I was pretty and too young to be involved in
politics.''
   ``It was a man's world _ it still is,'' said Mrs. Lederer, who
went on to earn a degree in international relations at the
University of Geneva and open an import business.
   Before that, she worked from 1968 to 1971 in the old Manhattan
Playboy club, which closed in 1982.
   ``I was brought up in a convent,'' she explained. ``I wanted to
get a job where I wouldn't be so shy anymore.'' She said a club
manager's advice to stand tall and be proud of herself ``did more
for me than a psychiatrist could have done.''
   Lorraine Muscara, 28, rode the cottontail of the era. Her
employer, the Empire Club in Manhattan, opened in November 1985 and
closed in June 1986.
   Miss Muscara, director of sales for a Manhattan computer
maintenance company, hurried from her office three nights a week,
trading her business clothes for a bunny costume.
   ``It was a release. I couldn't wait to walk into the bunny
room,'' she said. ``It got me through the day sometimes.''
   Mrs. Lederer said she organized the reunion of ex-bunnies who
live in the metropolitan area at the suggestion of her 13-year-old
son.
   ``Years ago, we were teen-agers _ young and foolish,'' she said.
``Now, we've lived life, matured.''
   ``Some are bringing up babies on their own. Most of my
(ex-bunny) friends are in business; one is a doctor; one runs a
shelter; they have gone on to do incredible things with their
lives, for society,'' she added.

<HEAD>Dukakis Files State Financial Disclosure Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis filed state financial disclosure
forms Friday that show, in addition to his $85,000 gubernatorial
salary, three family trusts, stocks and a Brookline home.
   The Democratic presidential front-runner and his wife, Kitty,
own at least $1,000 in stock in Automatix Inc., a Billerica, Mass.,
company that makes industrial robots. The couple also owns at least
$1,000 in U.S. Treasury notes.
   The governor's home in Brookline has a value of at least
$100,000.
   Other than the interest earned from the trusts, the only family
income reported on the financial disclosure forms required by state
law stems from Dukakis' official salary.
   Kitty Dukakis is a trustee, director or board member of several
philanthropic and cultural groups, but she reported no income from
them. The groups include the Wang Center for the Performing Arts,
the Boston Ballet, Lesley College, a prison rehabilitation project
and the Public Space Partnerships Project.
   The governor's disclosure form lists three trusts: one set up in
1974 by his father in the name of his wife and children; another
created in 1949 under the will of Kitty Dukakis' grandmother, Mabel
Williams, to be distributed to Mrs. Dukakis' father, Harry Ellis
Dickson; and one created in 1972 by Dickson.
   It was the trust set up in by Dukakis' father, Panos Dukakis,
that drew attention last year when a report filed by Dukakis with
the Federal Election Commission revealed that until 1986, the trust
included stocks in companies doing business in South Africa. The
trust was valued last year at $1 million.
   The Mabel Williams trust was valued at $50,000 as of last year,
and the Dickson trust $60,000.
   Up-to-date and detailed information on the trusts is expected to
be available later this month when Dukakis is scheduled to file
disclosure forms with the federal commission and to make public his
1987 income tax returns.
   The state disclosure forms do not require reporting precise
incomes or values of assets.
   Dukakis reported no real estate transactions, mortgage holdings
or loans on his state disclosure form.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis turned aside
sharpened criticism from rival Jesse Jackson on Friday and said it
would be a ``tragedy'' if President Reagan vetoes legislation
requiring companies to give notice before closing factories.
   He said workers ``deserve better from America.''
   Dukakis criticized the Reagan administration on issues ranging
from homelessness to problems with the nation's airlines under
deregulation as he began campaigning toward Ohio's Democratic
presidential primary next Tuesday.
   Campaigning on the one-year anniversary of his formal entry into
the presidential race, Dukakis urged supporters to ignore polls
showing him far ahead.
   Dukakis did not mention his remaining Democratic rival, Jackson,
nor did he respond with criticism when asked about Jackson's sharp
comments in Ohio that Dukakis would merely ``manage'' Reagan's
economic program rather than change it.
   ``I just don't talk about these things _ I have a record,''
Dukakis said. ``... Not only that, I balance budgets, and that's
something that hasn't been a feature of Reaganomics.''
   Dukakis mentioned disagreements he has with Jackson on the
Middle East and other issues and said, ``I think you'll continue to
see us conduct this campaign with a lot of mutual respect and
genuine friendship, and the fact that we disagree on some issues I
don't think will change that.''
   Appearing before labor leaders at a local union hall in
Columbus, and later before a lunchtime crowd in downtown Dayton,
the Massachusetts governor pointed to his own state's law requiring
companies to make public their plans to close plants. He said it
had saved jobs by giving workers and local governments the chance
to prepare or find alternatives.
   ``I hope the president will take the time to think about the
three million American workers who lose their jobs in this country
every year through plant shutdowns,'' Dukakis said. ``In at least
half those cases, those plants shut down with little or no notice
to those most affected _ their own employees.
   ``These people are our neighbors,'' he said. ``They deserve
better from their employers. They deserve better from America.''
   Reagan has said he would veto trade legislation passed
overwhelmingly by the Senate this week because of a provision
requiring 60-days' notice on plant closings.
   ``I hope he will reconsider,'' Dukakis said.
   Speaking to reporters later in Youngstown, Dukakis said: ``I
think it would be a tragedy if it was vetoed. ... I think he might
reconsider.''
   Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee after big wins in New
York and Pennsylvania, is battling Jesse Jackson for Ohio's 159
Democratic delegates at stake Tuesday. After flying around Ohio
Friday and Saturday, he also planned to visit Indiana, where 79
delegates are also at stake in that state's primary Tuesday.
   Before leaving for Ohio, Dukakis released copies of letters sent
to Reagan and congressional leaders urging enactment of the trade
bill and said he would make the bill a major part of his attack on
Vice President George Bush, the certain GOP nominee, if the measure
is vetoed by Reagan.
   Dukakis appeared in Columbus with Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, who
last year had flirted with the idea of running for the presidency.
Celeste spoke warmly of Dukakis but later said he was taking no
stand in the race.
   ``It's a desire to ensure an open, enthusiastic primary in the
state in which Reverend Jackson knows he's as welcome as Governor
Dukakis at every place, including the governor's office, and his
supporters know we expect them to be part of a unified effort in
the fall,'' Celeste said.
   Dukakis did not cite Bush by name but referred to him in saying
the Republican Party ``is going to be asking Americans to keep
things as they are. But I say we have to change.''
   Repeating his call for reinvestment in American jobs, Dukakis
said: ``I'm not running for president to overthrow governments in
Central America. I want to create jobs in middle America.''

   A car ferry undergoing repairs
hit a dock Friday and tipped over, temporarily trapping 21 crewmen
and workers, but no injuries were reported, police said.
   Port authority officials said the cause of the accident was
being investigated.
   Harbor police said the accident occurred at 3:15 p.m. when the
600-foot ferry crashed into the Seebeck dock in this northwestern
port.
   Police spokesman Peter Gusovius said all 21 crewmen and workers
aboard were rescued by helicopters and boats.
   ``They were all taken from the ferry,'' he said. ``No one was in
the water.''
   Gusovius said the ferry Kattegat is registered in the
Philippines and was in Bremerhaven for repairs. Crews were working
Friday evening to right the vessel, he said.

<TEXT>
   Since the prison disturbances by Mariel Cuban
detainees last fall, the government has released more than 1,000 of
the detainees into halfway houses or with family sponsors in
communities, the Justice Department announced Friday.
   One of the triggers to last year's uprisings at federal prisons
in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., was the fact that the government was
taking so long to place them in halfway houses once they were
deemed eligible for release, according to legal advocates for the
detainees. Federal officials said they were having trouble finding
halfway house space for the detainees.
   From last June until the time the prison riots erupted in
November, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had released
106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A total
of 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances.
   INS has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since last
June, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots.
   Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of the
denials have been decided since the uprisings.
   When the riots broke out, there were about 7,600 Cuban detainees
in various facilities.
   The Justice Department also announced it plans to repatriate 14
Mariel Cubans, the first group of detainees designated for return
to Cuba since the prison disturbances.
   The 14, in federal custody since completing prison sentences for
crimes committed in the United States, have been notified that the
INS intends to send them back, the Justice Department said.
   Those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted of
crimes including voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, attempted
first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape.
   The repatriation process will include a review of their cases by
a Justice Department review panel under an agreement which ended
the rioting at Atlanta and Oakdale.
   Those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity to
submit additional information on their behalf to the Justice
Department review panels, which specifically exclude immigration
officers.

   The Senate Ethics Committee criticized Sen.
David Durenberger on Friday for discussing an espionage case in
public last year, but stopped short of recommending disiplinary
action against the Minnnesota Republican.
   The committee said the remarks by Durenberger, the immediate
past chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had
``jeopardized the mutual confidence which must exist between the
Congress and the intelligence community.''
   ``The ethics committee has determined that your statements gave
the appearance that you were disclosing sensitive national security
information,'' Durenberger was told.
   The Ethics Committee investigation centered on comments
Durenberger made at an event sponsored by the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee in Palm Beach, Fla., on March 15, 1987.
   Some members of the Senate were said to have been angered by
Durenberger's reported disclosure to the group that then-CIA
Director William J. Casey in 1982 had ``changed the rules'' under
which allies did not spy on each other by recruiting an Israeli
military officer to spy on Israel for the United States.
   Durenberger later denied he had revealed any classified
information.
   In its letter to Durenberger, the Ethics Committee said:
``Because the committee has concluded that your actions were not
intentional, deliberate, nor attended with gross negligence, and
because of the particular facts of this case, we will not recommend
that the Senate take institutional action against you. However, the
committee wants to make it clear that it does not condone your
actions.''
   The letter was signed by Sens. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., David
Pryor, D-Ark, Terry Sanford, D-N.C., Warren Rudman, R-N.H., Jesse
Helms, R-N.C. and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   Durenberger said Friday he was ``gratified by their findings
that no action is warranted.''
   But he added: ``I respectfully disagree with the ethic
committee's conclusion that my statements gave an appearance that
may have put at risk the mutual confidence that must exist between
Congress and the intelligence community.''
   Sources present at the Palm Beach meeting who said they took
careful notes reported that Durenberger said the CIA recruited its
Israeli spy after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The spy passed
along sensitive information about the invasion, Durenberger
reportedly told the group.
   Durenberger's comments were said to be aimed at giving context
to the case of Jonathan Jay Pollard, an American convicted of
spying on the United States for Israel.
   In a statement issued later, Durenberger said he had not been
seeking to justify Israel's recruitment of Pollard, but ``rather to
shed light on how it may have occurred'' and give it
``perspective.''
   In his statement Friday, Durenberger repeated his previous
assertions that he had not disclosed anything classified, but was
only referring to newspaper accounts at the time whose content led
to speculation that there may have been U.S. intelligence sources
in the Israeli government.
   ``I believe that I exercised due care in preparation for this
speech,'' Durenberger said. ``I respectfully disagree with the
ethic committee's conclusion that my statements gave the appearance
that I was disclosing sensitive information.''
   ``To the contrary, I expressly indicated that the source of my
remarks was newspaper articles, and I said nothing to leave the
impression that I was relaying confidential information,'' he said.
   ``Director Casey was a strong leader, loyal to his own view of
the public interest, but his belief that Congress should play
little or no role in intelligence oversight led to a lack of mutual
confidence long before March 1987,'' Durenberger said.
   In a separate statement Friday, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., said Durenberger ``was an excellent chairman during one of
the most demanding and crucial periods for intelligence oversight.
I had just as much confidence in Dave before the Ethics Committee
examination as I do right now.''

<HEAD>Chemical Plant Partially Closed As Public Health Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Friday shut down some production
facilities at a chemical plant in Armenia after environmentalists
contended the equipment increased cases of cancer and other
diseases.
   Soviet television said two units producing chloroprene rubber
were taken out of production Friday morning at the Nairit
Scientific Production Association in Yerevan because they caused
``irreparable harm to the city's ecology and people's health.''
   The decision was made due to ``multiple demands of residents of
Yerevan about a complicated ecological situation,'' an announcer
said.
   A correspondent for the television news program Vremya reported
from Yerevan that the two units sent 3,500 tons of pollutants into
the air annually.
   The report showed workers turning off valves on the units, built
in the late 1930s. The plant will continue to produce other items,
including anti-corrosive paint, according to the report.
   The shutdown was an example of how Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, has made
authorities more responsive to citizens' complaints.
   The Soviet news media has carried a number of reports about
industrial pollution as a threat to public health. Many cities are
reported to be in violation of national air pollution standards. In
January, the government formed a State Committee for Environmental
Protection.
   At least 3,000 Armenians marched in Yerevan Oct. 17 to demand
the shutdown of Nairit and a nuclear power station.
   Soviet television said the national Cabinet, known as the
Council of Ministers, in December ordered an end to production of
chloroprene at Nairit using old technology.
   In March 1986, activists in Armenia sent Gorbachev a petition
demanding that the plant be relocated. They said it was
contributing to a massive increase in stomach cancer, cardiac and
respiratory disease and congenital defects. They claimed that over
the past 15 years the number of leukemia cases in and around
Yerevan quadrupled.

<HEAD>Mayor: City Has the Money, But Squabble Stalls Payroll Checks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Carl E. Officer said Friday
that his cash-strapped city has come up with the money for its
biweekly payroll, but that workers still won't get paid on time
because of a City Hall squabble.
   City Treasurer Charlotte Moore, whose elective job includes
authority to sign city payroll checks, posted a brief note Friday
afternoon advising city workers that they would not receive their
checks until Monday. Friday was payday.
   On Thursday, she had said that city coffers were about $70,000
short of meeting the $230,000 payroll. But Officer charged that the
city had the money on Friday and said Mrs. Moore was withholding
the money deliberately.
   ``This is a case of protest by the city treasurer because of
recent layoffs in her office,'' Officer said in a telephone
interview.
   Twenty-five of the approximately 275 city workers were laid off
Monday _ including all of Mrs. Moore's regular staff _ and the city
expects to cut another 25 in the next week or two, Comptroller
LaMar Gentry said.
   Mrs. Moore did not return numerous telephone calls to her office
Friday.
   Officer said he also had tried unsuccessfully to reach her.
   ``She's the most wanted person in town right now,'' Officer
said, adding he had heard many complaints from city workers.
   The withholding of the paychecks ``doesn't make any sense,
especially when you have over a half a million dollars in cash in
the bank.''
   Officer said Friday that the money had been transferred from
other accounts _ mostly revenues collected for the city by the
state or county _ in plenty of time to cover the paychecks.
   Gentry agreed with the mayor's charge that the payroll shortage
was trumped up by Mrs. Moore because of the layoffs.
   ``There is no problem with the payroll, only in the treasurer's
eyes,'' he said.
   East St. Louis has been on a financial roller coaster for
decades. Sixty-one percent of the city's 55,000 residents receive
some kind of public assistance and about 40 percent of its citizens
are unemployed.
   Officials say the depressed city's financial problems show no
sign of subsiding.
   On May 17 _ two days after its next payroll is due _ the city
must make a $54,000 payment on a court judgment it owes a Granite
City man, Walter DeBow. DeBow was seriously injured in a 1985
beating at the city jail. Attorneys for his family last month
obtained a temporary freeze of the city's assets to force payment
of the settlement, which totals about $4 million.
   But Gentry said he expects the city to be able to cover its
upcoming payrolls and the payments on the DeBow judgment by
shuffling funds around in the ``day-by-day, week-by-week process''
of trying to keep the city afloat.
   ``I've been doing it (the comptroller's job) since '84 and we
haven't missed one (payroll), but we've had to do some juggling
acts,'' he said.
   Gentry also said the city was in no greater danger of bankruptcy
Friday than it was four years earlier.

<HEAD>FDA Announces Recall Of Humco Ipecac Syrup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Friday
announced a nationwide recall of one-ounce bottles of Humco brand
ipecac syrup because some bottles instead contained toxic
eucalyptus oil.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young urged parents to check medicine
cabinets for the product and said no parent should administer the
product, which is used to induce vomiting after a poisoning.
Immediate medical help should be obtained if eucalyptus oil is
swallowed, he said.
   Eucalyptus oil can be extremely dangerous if ingested, causing
epigastric burning, nausea, vomiting, convulsions and coma. As
little as a teaspoon of the oil can cause death. It normally is
used in minute amounts for vaporizers or in products such as nose
drops.
   All bottles should be returned to their place of purchase, the
FDA said.
   The manufacturer, Humco Laboratory of Texarkana, Texas,
undertook the recall Friday after Thrift Drug Co. in Pittsburgh
reported to the FDA that seven bottles labeled as ipecac had been
found to instead contain eucalyptus oil.
   The recall includes all lots of Humco brand ipecac syrup. The
bottles have screw-on caps. It is the second recall of ipecac syrup
within the past week due to a labeling mix-up.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's top
counter-terrorism expert on Friday predicted a probable surge in
Palestinian terrorism as a result of the uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories and the killing of a Palestinian
guerrilla chieftain.
   Ambassador L. Paul Bremer also said Libya continues to plan
international terrorist attacks, but is looking for such surrogates
as the Japanese Red Army ``to do its dirty work.''
   In an interview, Bremer said, ``There is a possibility of a
measurable increase of Palestinian terrorism'' in the coming months.
   He cited as reasons the five-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the
killing of Khalil Wazir, the second-in-command of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. The killing of Wazir, known as Abu Jihad,
was carried out by Israeli agents in Tunisia almost two weeks ago.
   The rapprochement between PLO chief Yasser Arafat and Syrian
President Hafez Assad following Abu Jihad's assassination also may
contribute to a terror campaign, although it is too soon to assess
the impact of the thaw, he said.
   Abu Nidal, the nom de guerre for Sabri Bannah, continues to plan
terror attacks from his headquarters in Libya where he maintains
300 to 400 operatives, Bremer said. Abu Nidal heads a Palestinian
faction which broke away from the Arafat's Fatah branch of the PLO
and which has carried out some of the bloodiest terror attacks in
the world over the past few years.
   The organization also maintains eight training camps in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, he said. Assad,
in an attempt to win U.S. support, expelled Abu Nidal from Syria
last summer.
   But Bremer said the group's presence in the Bekaa Valley is a
continued irritant in U.S.-Syrian relations.
   Abu Nidal operatives were apprehended in the Philippines over
the past six months, said a U.S. official who asked not to be
named. Also in the Philippines, Libya has links with the Filipino
Moro guerrilla group on the southern island of Mindanao, he said.
   Several minor bombings in Jordan over the last few months may
have been the work of Abu Nidal, said the official.
   Having been intimidated by the U.S. bombing raid on Libya two
years ago, Col. Moammar Gadhafi has been ``casting about looking
for surrogates'' to carry out terror attacks, Bremer said.
   Among the candidates are Abu Nidal and the Irish Republican
Army, Bremer said. Libya is believed to have shipped the IRA
hundreds of tons of Soviet-made weapons over the past three years.
   Gadhafi also ``sent out feelers'' to the Japanese Red Army and
the Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, he said. The
Japanese Red Army claimed responsibility for a bombing earlier this
month at a USO club in Naples, Italy, where a U.S. servicewoman was
killed.
   Bremer noted that the attack was carried out a day before the
April 15 second anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Libya. He also
said a Japanese Red Army member was caught April 12 by state
troopers in New Jersey with two bombs in his car.
   The man is not cooperating with police, but he may have planned
to use the bombs on the anniversary date, Bremer said.
   In general, terror attacks in 1987 rose by 5.9 percent over the
1985 record _ from 785 to 832, according to figures compiled by
Bremer's office. The increase reflects the surge in bombing attacks
in Pakistan, most of which are attributed to the Soviet-backed
Afghan secret police.
   After Afghanistan, Iran is the second largest sponsor of
international terrorism, with 40 attacks to its name in 1987,
compared with 34 in 1985, according to the figures.

   Eight of OPEC's 13 member nations
tentatively agreed early Saturday to a small cut in oil production
for May and June in an effort to prop up sagging prices, cartel
leaders said.
   Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, told reporters
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates ``reserved
their position'' until OPEC's next meeting, which he said was set
for Saturday night.
   Iraq, which has not joined OPEC's existing production-sharing
system, was not expected to particiopate in the proposed new cuts,
said Venezuelan Oil Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti.
   Hernandez said the proposal was made by Algeria.
   ``This proposal had the support of eight countries,'' he said.
   The four gulf Arab oil ministers were to consult with their
governments and report a final decision at the next session,
Hernandez told reporters.
   The production cuts would take effect May 1.
   It was not immediately clear how the proposed cut of 300,000
barrels a day, if adopted, would be divided among the 13 members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The proposal calls for oil export cuts by OPEC in conjunction
with a group of independent oil producers. The non-OPEC group was
invited to discuss strategy at OPEC headquarters in Vienna earlier
this week.
   The aim is to raise prices to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel,
from the current range of $14 to $16, by tightening supplies.
   Nervous traders sent oil prices lower on European markets, where
Brent crude oil from the North Sea tumbled 66 cents, to $16.54 a
42-gallon barrel, after having lost 30 cents on Thursday.
   Later, prices continued slumping at the New York Mercantile
Exchange, dropping as much as 43 cents per barrel before rallying
toward the close and ending largely unchanged, analysts said. June
contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
settled at $17.99 per barrel, up 1 cent from Thursday.
   The non-OPEC group, comprised of Mexico, China, Malaysia,
Angola, Egypt and Oman, on Tuesday offered to reduce their oil
exports by 5 percent if OPEC did likewise. The cuts would be for
May and June only.
   OPEC leaders initially welcomed the offer, which marked the
first such proposal from a group of outside oil producers since
OPEC was founded in 1960. Some called it a historic first step
toward creating a global oil alliance.
   Once the cartel leaders sat down to discuss the proposal,
however, sharp differences emerged, officials said after an initial
session that ended early Friday.
   The early discussions focused on whether supplies were far
enough out of balance with demand to require a cut in production,
said Fernandos Santos, Ecuador's oil minister. In an attempt to
resolve this question, a team of technical experts from the 13
cartel member countries met Friday afternoon.
   The experts group failed to reach a unified view, however a
majority of the experts said some form of additional production
restraint was needed in order to get prices higher, according to
sources speaking privately.
   Saudi King Fahd appeared to signal on Thursday that he would not
accept any further reductions in OPEC production. He said prices
would go up if OPEC simply stuck to its existing output quotas,
which often are violated.
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest oil producer, injected added
tension into the Vienna talks with its decision Tuesday to break
diplomatic relations with Iran, citing what it called a hostile
Iranian attitude.
   Iran, fighting a 7{-year-old war with Iraq, has attacked neutral
shipping in the Persian Gulf, including Saudi ships, in retaliation
for Iraqi attacks on Iranian-chartered ships in the waterway.

   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered a
close inspection of the upper skin of older-model Boeing 737s last
October because of cracks near where sections of sheet metal
overlap, warning such cracks could cause rapid cabin decompression.
   The twin-engine Aloha Airlines jetliner that ripped open at
24,000 feet was among the early-model Boeing 737s subject to the
FAA directive as well as to a series of service bulletins by Boeing
outlining the inspection programs, officials said Friday.
   The FAA's concern had been raised last year because routine
inspections turned up cracks near fasteners that join sections of
sheet metal in three aircraft. The same inspections also found
metal strips on the fuselage coming loose on some early-model
Boeing 737s because the lamination was no longer holding.
   Stephanie Ackerman, manager of public relations for Aloha, said
Friday, ``We are in full compliance with the October directive. We
did receive the directive, the inspections were carried out and we
are in compliance.'' She would not elaborate on what the
inspections revealed, but said nothing was found that caused alarm.
   Investigators have yet to determine the cause of Thursday's
incident in which a huge upper section of the Aloha jetliner tore
away, leaving passengers exposed to the open skies at 24,000 feet.
The pilot made an emergency landing within 15 minutes, but a flight
attendant was swept out of the plane to her death and 60 passengers
were injured, two critically.
   Sources who asked not to be identified said that investigators
are focusing on a possible structural failure that could have
caused a rapid depressurization of the aircraft cabin.
   One theory is that a structural failure such as a tear in the
cabin skin might have caused an initial loss of cabin pressure and
then the force of the strong winds may have ripped away the huge
upper section of the fuselage from just behind the front entry door
to within a few feet of the wing.
   Investigators, however, also are examining the cabin
pressurization system to determine whether it might have
malfunctioned.
   The airworthiness directive issued by the FAA last Oct. 5
required that operators of older Boeing 737s inspect the extreme
upper sections of the planes' outer skin from just behind the front
entry door to the tail section for cracks and metal strips that may
be coming loose.
   ``Failure to detect and repair cracks could result in rapid
depressurization of the airplane,'' the directive warned.
   Jim Boynton, a Boeing spokesman, said in Seattle that the
manufacturer has issued a series of service bulletins on the need
for periodic inspections on the aircraft skin of the older Boeing
737s for possible cracking or structural weakening because of
corrosion.
   The last bulletin was issued two weeks before Thursday's
incident, he said. Unlike FAA directives, the bulletins from the
manufacturer do not require mandatory compliance.
   The FAA directive last October also outlined a detailed schedule
of future periodic inspections to protect against cracks or
loosening of metal strips which reinforce the fuselage where
sections of sheet metal overlap.
   The directive covered the first 291 Boeing 737s manufactured.
Later aircraft had a stronger bonding and fastening system for the
sheet metal and were not the subject of concern, the FAA said.
   The Boeing Co. has built 1,109 Boeing 737-200 series aircraft
such as the one involved in Thursday's incident.
   According to Boeing, the Aloha plane involved in Thursday's
incident was No. 152 off the assembly line. It was delivered to a
leasing company in April 1968 and leased to Aloha in December of
that year, according to Boeing and the FAA.
   FAA records showed that the plane had extensive repair work done
to mend cracks and corroded metal on two occasions in 1983, but
most of that work involved problems with the lower half of the
plane which seemed not to be related to Thursday's incident.
   Extensive work also was required in 1983 and several other times
since then on cracks and corrosion on the plane's wings, according
to FAA records. A section of the plane's right wing was replaced
last year when cracks were found in the wing.
   Many of those repairs were required by another FAA directive in
1982 which stemmed in part from an investigation into the 1981
crash of a Boeing 737 in Taiwan which had similarities to the
incident Thursday in Hawaii, according to aviation experts.
   On Aug. 22, 1981, a Boeing 737 belonging to Far East Air
Transport crashed after the top of the cabin's metal skin tore from
the plane at about 22,000 feet. In both the Taiwan and Aloha
accidents, about the same section of the plane ripped away.
   Charles O. Miller, an aviation consultant familiar with the 1981
crash, said a big difference was that in the Taiwan accident the
structural weakness was linked to corrosion in the forward baggage
compartment below the cabin floor.
   In Thursday's incident, however, the Aloha jet remained intact
below the cabin floor and the control cables were not damaged,
allowing the pilot to maintain control and bring the jet in for a
safe landing.

<HEAD>Cuban Art Official Refusing To Quit Over Auction Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A museum official, under fire from Cuban exiles for
including in an auction works by artists they consider sympathetic
to the Cuban government, accused his detractors of using the type
of totalitarian tactics they oppose.
   ``I have been subject to extreme pressure,'' said Ramon Cernuda,
vice president of the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture.
   Cernuda has ignored requests to resign, though he says he has
received so many threatening telephone calls that he had to have
his phone number changed.
   The flap began over an April 22 auction that earned the museum
$50,000 in commissions from the auction of 173 paintings by various
Cuban artists, some of whom live or lived in Cuba and some of whom
live elsewhere.
   Some of the works were by artists considered by the strongly
anti-Communist Cuban exile community to be sympathetic to Fidel
Castro.
   The privately funded museum's governing board of directors,
which had narrowly approved the auction, met in emergency session
Friday to discuss the dispute, but there was no immediate word on
whether the board would announce any decision. Cernuda said he
would resign only if the 54-member board asked him to do so.
   Mignon Medrano, a museum founder and its former president, is
among those accusing Cernuda of tinkering with the museum's
ideological slant in what Medrano considers a misguided pursuit of
artistic freedom.
   ``We are a museum created and sustained by Cuban exiles,''
Medrano said. ``As long as we have a voice, we will never be a
propaganda vehicle for those artists who collaborate with the
communists.''
   Museum president Nunzio Mainieri, who says he has asked Cernuda
to quit because of the flap, has also canceled a planned showing
next month of work by Cuban artist Amelia Pelaez. One of Cuba's
foremost painters, she died on the island in 1986.
   She recently has been accused by some anti-Castro activists as a
collaborator of that government.
   That accusation is absurd, said art expert Jose Gomez-Sicre,
founder of the modern art museum at the Organization of American
States in Washington, D.C.
   ``They're imbeciles when they say that. She was the best painter
we ever produced,'' he said. ``She never got involved in politics.
All she had to do was paint.''
   The artist's 85-year-old sister, Elena Pelaez of Miami, also
denied the collaboration charge.
   ``She hasn't been a collaborator of any government, much less
this one,'' Ms. Pelaez said of Cuba. ``She just painted and painted
and painted.''

<HEAD>Two Accused of Smuggling Pelts Of Endangered Animals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former candidate for U.S. Senate and the husband
of a former state revenue commissioner have been indicted by a
federal grand jury in Nevada for allegedly smuggling the pelts of
endangered animals into the United States.
   The grand jury issued a 14-count indictment Thursday against two
wealthy physicians, Dr. Constantine Hampers, who has homes in
Weston, Mass., and Dublin, N.H.; and Dr. Edward B. Hager of
Lyndeborough, N.H.
   Hampers is the husband of former Massachusetts Revenue
Commissioner Joyce Hampers. Hager finished fourth in the Republican
primary for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire in 1980.
   U.S. Attorney Frank L. McNamara said Friday that the endangered
animals, which were hunted in Mexico, were two ocelots, a mountain
lion and two jaguars. It is legal to kill jaguars and ocelots in
Mexico with proper permits, but it is illegal to return them to the
United States.
   The ocelot and the jaguar are on the endangered species list.
The mountain lion is on the protected species list.
   ``If the reports are true, it shows a shocking insensitivity to
these endangered species which cannot be countenanced,'' McNamara
said.
   Robert Keefe, a lawyer for Hampers, said his client ``maintains
his innocence. He will enter a plea of not guilty and expects to be
vindicated at the end of trial.'' Hager's home and office have
unlisted telephone numbers, and he could not be reached for comment
Friday evening.
   McNamara's office reportedly obtained search warrants for
Hampers' and Hager's homes and offices and confiscated three
mounted ocelots, two jaguars and a mountain lion. Chief Assistant
U.S. Attorney L.J. O'Neale of Nevada said the trophies will be used
as evidence.
   Hampers founded National Medical Care, a Waltham-based company
that was a pioneer in the artificial kidney field. His wife, who
was revenue commissioner in 1979-82, ran unsuccessfully against
Massachusetts State Treasurer Robert Crane two years ago.
   Hager is a former president of the New England Conservative
Action Committee.
   Hampers and Hager each is charged with two counts of conspiracy
to smuggle wildlife, two counts of smuggling, six counts of illegal
importation of wildlife and four counts of unlawful transportation
of wildlife.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to five years in prison
and fined $100,000 each.
   The indictment said Hampers and Hager knew they were acting
illegally when they paid Antonio Rivera, a Mexican national who was
their hunting guide, to bring the pelts into the United States.
   Hampers and Hager allegedly arranged to have the pelts stuffed
by a taxidermist in Colorado, who sent the mounted trophies to the
men's homes in New Hampshire. The indictment charges that Rivera
met the men in Las Vegas to deliver the pelts.
   The taxidermist, James Bensley, reportedly cooperated with
authorities, allowing his telephone calls with Hampers and Hager to
be recorded by federal agents.

   Passengers on Friday praised the Aloha
Airlines pilot who safely brought down a jetliner blown open at
24,000 feet, with one man saying the landing was ``just like riding
in a Cadillac.''
   ``It came down so smooth, it was better than a regular
landing,'' said Mae Kagihara, who had thought the plane was going
to crash Thursday.
   The Boeing 737, piloted by Robert Schornstheimer, landed at
Kahului Airport on Maui Island, 15 to 20 feet of its upper fuselage
_ just behind the front passenger door _ torn away to the floor.
Witnesses said one engine was on fire. One attendant apparently was
sucked from the cabin to her death, and 61 people were injured, two
critically.
   ``I give credit to the pilot. He brought that plane down so
smoothly. It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said John Lopez,
40, one of 89 passengers aboard Flight 243 from Hilo, on the Hawaii
Island, to Honolulu.
   A structural failure is suspected of having caused the cabin to
blow open. Investigators have ruled out a bomb blast, sources said.
   Schornstheimer, a 42-year-old former Air Force pilot, realized
there was a hole in fuselage but was not aware of the extent of the
damage until after the landing, said his father, also named Robert.
   ``He says it was just something else _ all of a sudden there was
this noise, and the plane's flying funny and there's a big drag on
it, so he immediately decided to change the flight plan to land at
the Maui airport, which was closest, and he was able to get it in
and land it,'' the elder Schornstheimer father said from his home
in Marietta, Ohio.
   The pilot was taken to an undisclosed location by Aloha for
questioning by investigators from the Federal Aviation
Administration and National Transportation Safety Board, officials
said.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley telephoned and
congratulated him for the landing, said a spokesman for the
department.
   ``Because the upper structure was gone, there was a possibility
of the plane buckling,'' said Dale Bringelson, owner of Island
Aeromotive, who watched the landing from his company hangar at
Kahului Airport. ``If he hadn't been real careful, it could have
busted in two. The man was highly skilled and it speaks well of the
profession.''
   Mark Eberly, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he and a
friend dropped to their knees as they saw the plane land, its cabin
exposed.
   The jetliner was weaving as it headed in, he said. ``You could
tell his plane was on one engine,'' Eberly said. ``One engine was
on fire and smoking.''
   ``I have to give the pilot credit. He brought it in good,''
Eberly said.
   ``I can't believe the airplane was still flying or that people
sitting in that area survived,'' said F. Emmett Miller, an Aloha
pilot who has flown 737s for 20 years. ``I think it's a statement
probably any pilot would make looking at it. I just think that Bob
Schornstheimer did a wonderful job.''
   The elder Schornstheimer said his son sounded calm when they
spoke by telephone Thursday night.
   ``He's pretty calm under pressure. He said he was calm and did
what needed to be done, just like any other pilot would have. They
were talking about it on TV like (he was a hero), but he said he
just did what any other pilot would have done in the same
circumstance,'' the father said.
   Schornstheimer's wife, Mary, said she learned of the explosion
and safe landing from friends. ``I wasn't worried,'' she said. ``I
have a lot of confidence in his ability as a pilot.''
   The elder Schornstheimer said his son was in the Air Force from
1967 to 1974, serving as a flight instructor and then as an air
traffic controller at Vance Air Force base in Enid, Okla.
   Schornstheimer then worked as a civilian air traffic controller
at Kaneohe Marine Air base on Oahu from 1974 until joining Aloha as
a pilot in 1977, his father said.
   Schornstheimer is secretary-treasurer of the local council of
the Air Line Pilots Assocation and just made captain status this
year, said his stepmother, Nancy Schornstheimer.

   Clarabelle Lansing, the Aloha Airlines
flight attendant presumed dead after a jet blew open at 24,000
feet, was a 37-year employee who wore a tropical flower in her hair
and appeared in ads for the airline.
   ``She was very personable. She reminds you of the
top-of-the-line flight attendants you see on the major carriers,''
said Dale Randles, a Honolulu resident who flies Aloha to Maui once
a week. ``She was very attractive, a beautiful woman. You could ask
her anything and she'd answer your questions.''
   Mrs. Lansing, 57, apparently was sucked out of an Aloha jet
carrying 95 people Thursday after a third of the Boeing 737's
fuselage tore away during a Hilo-to-Honolulu flight, officials said.
   The jet safely at Kahului Airport 15 minutes later. Sixty-one
people were injured. Air and sea crews searched the Pacific Ocean
for Mrs. Lansing without success.
   Mrs. Lansing, who was known to friends as C.B., was born on the
island of Kauai, called the Garden Island for its unspoiled beauty.
She joined Aloha after high school and was among the its first
flight attendants.
   ``She was a wonderful employee, a great lady,'' said Stephanie
Ackerman, a spokeswoman for Aloha Airlines. ``Our passengers loved
her.''
   Mrs. Lansing's husband, Robert E. Lansing, works for the
University of Hawaii in Honolulu. The couple had no children.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet official on Friday criticized NATO's
decision to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the issue would
be discussed at the superpower summit in Moscow next month.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin told a news conference
the action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization diminished the
significance of last year's U.S.-Soviet pact to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   NATO defense ministers agreed at their Nuclear Planning Group
meeting in Brussels Thursday to develop a replacement for the
short-range Lance missile and a new air-launched missile for
bombers.
   Adamishin called the NATO decision serious and said, ``We are
against modernization. We want to reduce the level of nuclear and
other armaments and not to raise it.''
   He was asked if the issue was serious enough to be discussed at
the May 29-June 3 meeting of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
President Reagan and replied:
   ``They have to discuss this problem. It's one of the key
problems of the situation.
   ``As soon as we have some result in reducing arms, immediately
there is a tendency _ and it's a negative tendency _ to try to
compensate, to try not to give the full development to this
disarmament tendency.''
   Adamishin said it was a ``rather interesting coincidence'' that
in Brussels America asserted the Soviet Union was conducting tests
to shorten the range of some intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs), so they could be targeted towards Europe, and then NATO
agreed to develop new missiles.
   He said: ``Let's consider for a moment that the Americans are
right and we are making ICBMs to hit targets in Europe, although
experts would say this is absolute nonsense, ... why not appeal to
the Soviet Union to demand clarification, to discuss this situation?
   ``No, at the moment the news breaks out, the decision has been
adopted (by NATO).''
   Adamishin said he still hoped U.S. and Soviet negotiators would
reach agreement on cutting long-range nuclear missiles by 50
percent before the summit.
   ``If we fail in climbing this mountain, then the task would be
to go as high as possible on the way toward the top and to create a
situation which would make it impossible to go back,'' he said.
   ``We are working in this direction.... There are very serious
and large efforts on our side to make this agreement a reality.''
   He added the United States should be ``a little bit more
persistent'' in trying to resolve outstanding issues, and listed as
examples a ceiling on sea-launched missiles and a verification
system.
   Both sides have agreed to those points, he said, but Washington
has not specified a ceiling or responded to Soviet proposals on
verification.
   In the case of ICBMs and submarine-launched missiles, Adamishin
said ``there is more or less a clear picture emerging as to how the
agreement would work.''
   But with sea-launched cruise missiles and some other weapons
where the United States has ``a considerable superiority over us''
there is no agreement, he said. He did not specify what other
weapons he was referring to.

   The Justice Department on Friday cleared one
of its former prosecutors, best-selling novelist Scott F. Turow, of
allegations that he may have obstructed justice in a criminal
investigation.
   The allegations were contained in a federal appeals court
opinion which raised ethical and legal questions over the fact that
Turow, while an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago in the early
1980s, used a criminal defense lawyer as an informant against his
own client.
   Turow, who wrote the book ``Presumed Innocent'' about a Midwest
prosecutor falsely accused of murder, ``did not hinder or obstruct
the administration of justice in any way,'' Justice Department
official John Keeney wrote in a one-page letter to Turow's attorney.
   All decisions by Turow were approved by his supervisors and
``there is no evidence that any of the actions taken by Mr. Turow
or his superiors violated any federal criminal statute,'' said
Keeney, the acting criminal division chief in the Justice
Department.
   Turow said in a statement that he was gratified by the decision.
   ``As I have said from the outset, I am convinced that the
conduct in question was proper, and necessary for effective law
enforcement,'' he said.
   The public integrity probe was launched after the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta refused to dismiss a drug case
in which Turow was marginally involved as a prosecutor. Federal
agents arrested a Miami man after finding more than 4 pounds of
cocaine in his house, and the man retained two Miami lawyers, one
of whom later became a target in ``Operation Greylord,'' an
investigation of corruption in Cook County, Ill.
   The target, Marvin Glass, contacted the U.S. attorney's office
in Chicago and offered to provide drug-related information in
exchange for favorable treatment of his case. His offer was
accepted and he met periodically with Turow.
   When Glass informed Turow he was representing the Miami man,
Ronald Ofshe, in the drug case, Turow encouraged him to proceed as
an informant and Turow obtained permission to place a microphone on
Glass to secretly record conversations between him and Ofshe,
according to the federal appeals court. Turow warned him not to
reveal any privileged attorney-client conversations.
   When Ofshe and his other lawyer discovered that Glass had been
acting as an informant, they tried unsuccessfully to have the case
dismissed.
   The appeals court rejected the request for dismissal last June,
but said that ``we do not condone the government's use of criminal
defense attorneys as informants against their clients.'' Last
November, a three-judge panel of the appeals court rejected Turow's
request to delete from the record its previous rebuke, saying it
was troubled by ``the ethical ramifications'' of his conduct and
that ``we believe that Turow may have committed an obstruction of
justice.''

   Scientists from around the globe gathered
Friday to plan for International Space Year in 1992 and were called
the spiritual descendants of Christopher Columbus.
   ``You are explorers who know of enduring hardship ... to triumph
over great natural obstacles,'' said Harvey Meyerson, president of
the U.S.-ISY Association, which is supervising the planning.
   The organization is orchestrating a series of space projects to
commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage to the
New World in 1492.
   ``This effort unites the universal themes ... that have powered
the human spirit in the past and continue to point to a future of
unlimited horizons,'' added James C. Fletcher, the chief of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Nearly 90 scientists from 17 space agencies, including those of
the Soviet Union, China and Western European, opened the three-day
meeting at the University of New Hampshire.
   The scientists are planning projects that will use space
satellites to research global problems including acid rain, ozone
depletion and the apparent gradual warming of the Earth's climate,
known as the greenhouse effect.
   Images of the planet from space, Fletcher said, have ``triggered
an awareness of Earth as a fragile and most precious life support
system, one made even more precious because ... it is the only body
in our solar system to harbor and nourish life.''
   The space year will include TV specials, expositions and trade
fairs. The events will help persuade people and governments that
space technology is worth its high cost, said Philip Goldsmith of
the European Space Agency, a consortium of several western European
nations.
   ``It's easy to convince the public and political masters of the
glamor projects like space travel ... but harder to maintain the
enthusiasm and funding levels for the long period needed to observe
Earth,'' Goldsmith said.

<HEAD>Survey: 4 Out Of 10 American Professionals Say Japan's Economy
Threatens U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four out of every 10 American professionals
surveyed believe Japan's economic power is a threat to the United
States and only 1 percent said U.S.-Japanese relations are very
good, according to the Foreign Ministry.
   The survey involved 1,550 politicians, lawyers and other
professionals and indicated most believe Japan has failed to
fulfill its international responsibilities commensurate with its
stature as an economic power, said the report released Thursday.
   The survey, widely carried in Japanese newspapers Friday, was
conducted by the U.S.-based Gallup Organization for the Foreign
Ministry. The professionals were selected randomly from ``Who's Who
in America.''
   Asked if they considered Japan's growing economic power to be a
benefit or threat to the United States, 40 percent of the
respondents said it was a threat, up from 37 percent in 1987 and
the highest level since the Foreign Ministry began the annual poll
of prominent Americans in 1972.
   About 47 percent said they thought Japan's growing economic
strength benefited the United States, down from 52 percent last
year and a record low, the Foreign Ministry said.
   About 70 percent of respondents said they felt Japanese high
technology presented a serious challenge to the United States.
   Only about 1 percent said they felt relations between the United
States and Japan were ``very good,'' while about 35 percent rated
them as ``good,'' 52 percent said they were ``normal'' and 11
percent called them ``not good.''
   The survey showed 61 percent of those questioned believe Japan
has done ``nothing at all'' to assume its share of world
responsibilities, despite its strong economic performance.
   Twenty-eight percent said Japan has assumed its due duties ``to
some extent.'' Only eight percent of the respondents said Japan has
``fully'' played up to its role as the second largest economic
power in the Western world after the United States, according to
the report.
   It said those who considered Japan an important country for
``the development and stability of the Asian and Pacific region''
totaled 43 percent, up from 41 percent in the 1987 survey. China
took second place with 35 percent of those surveyed in the poll.
   Regarding agricultural trade, 25 percent said Japan should
immediately open up its markets to U.S. farm products, up eight
points from 1987. Fifty-eight percent said Japan should disband its
farm market barriers on a gradual basis.

   Soup kitchens and shelters in the San
Francisco Bay area are serving mouth-watering red salmon steak
courtesy of government agents who had seized the fish caught
illegally near Taiwan.
   The Food Bank of Santa Clara County received 52,000 pounds free
and sold it it for 10 cents a pound to cover their costs to
agencies that serve the needy in Santa Clara, San Mateo and San
Francisco counties.
   Salmon steaks at one local supermarket chain Friday were selling
for $8.99.
   ``I sure hope they think it's wonderful,'' said Colleen Lukoff,
development coordinator for the Food Bank. ``We're just delighted
to have it. We don't usually get food like this here.''
   Federal officials impounded 372,000 pounds of salmon in early
1987 at the Port of Oakland and in cold storage plants in Riverside
and Watsonville. Federal inspectors approved the fish for human
consumption.
   Robert Taylor, an attorney with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said the government sold off most of
the fish to cover the costs of the investigation and litigation.
   The rest was donated to Second Harvest of Chicago, a national
food bank network.

   The rebels on Friday removed a major
obstacle to agreement in their talks with the government to work
out details of a cease-fire pact signed last month.
   The top rebel leader announced that the insurgents, known as
Contras, will not insist that their fighters be resupplied with
weapons and ammunition when they gather in seven cease-fire zones
during a permanent truce that is being considered.
   ``We have desisted from receiving replacements of weapons and
ammunition in the zones and we accept the concept of sovereignty
and indivisibility of national territory,'' Adolfo Calero told a
news conference.
   Previously the Contras insisted that the cease-fire zones be
autonomous.
   But Calero also said the Contras rejected the Sandinista
government's demand that all humanitarian aid to the rebels be
channeled through the International Red Cross. The rebels expect
$17.7 million in humanitarian aid already approved by the U.S.
Congress.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco told reporters
earlier Friday that the rebels have suffered deep internal
divisions and some segments have rejected disarming and returning
to civilian life.
   The rebels on Friday rejected a government proposal to extend by
30 days a 60-day cease-fire that began April 1. They said the
extension showed ``a lack of good will to fulfill the agreements.''
   The cease-fire agreement was signed on March 23.
   Sandinista officials said the rebel refusal to agree to an
extension showed the Contras were more interested in a truce than a
permanent peace.
   The interim cease-fire accord calls for the Contras to move into
cease-fire zones while talks continue on a long-term accord.
   Contra leaders insist the sides agree upon just how much freedom
the rebels will have within those zones.
   As the two sides continued their talks in the Nicaraguan
capital, police used rubber truncheons to break up a demonstration
at the headquarters of the General Workers Confederation, an
umbrella group for anti-Sandinista unions, and detained seven
people.
   Carlos Huembes, chairman of the Democratic Coordinate, a
coalition of unions and parties opposed to the government, said
four workers were arrested outside the Social Democratic Party
headquarters.
   He said they were en route to the demonstration in front of the
confederation building. Both the construction workers and the
Social Democratic Party belong to the coordinate.
   The arrests came five days after 38 construction workers and
auto mechanics began a hunger strike for higher salaries.
   Police cordoned off the entrance of the union headquarters where
about 150 people, including the hunger strikers, huddled behind the
metal grates of the building. A banner strung across the building
said: ``We prefer to die of hunger fighting with dignity than to
die working as slaves.''
   About 1,500 workers from both industries have staged wildcat
strikes since Feb. 25 demanding higher wages.
   Jose Castillo Osejo, head of privately-owned Radio Corporation,
which broadcast the news of the police actions, said Interior
Minister Tomas Borge punched him in the mouth when he was summoned
to the minister's office on Friday. He said Borge apologized later.
   Castillo is also a leader of the opposition Conservative Party
and the Permanent Commission on Human Rights, a private watchdog
group.
   The weapons issue has been a major one in the Contra-Sandinista
talks, particularly whether the rebels can keep their arms.
   The rebels say they will disarm when Nicaragua is on the
``irreversible road to democracy.'' The Sandinistas say disarming
is fundamental to the pact.
   But Tinoco said an apparent split among Contra leaders made such
negotiations more difficult. The rebels deny the split.
   The rebels had been supplied arms and weapons since 1981 through
CIA-operated air drops that stopped earlier this year when Congress
rejected President Reagan's request for renewed military aid.
   Government newspapers on Friday quoted President Daniel Ortega
as saying that $17.9 million in U.S.-approved aid for children
orphaned or injured in the war would be permitted only if channeled
through neutral organizations.
   Ortega was quoted as saying his side understood the ``good
intentions'' involved in Congress' approving the money, ``but we
cannot allow it to arrive through political organisms that are
clearly against the revolution.''
   The aid, part of a nearly $48 million Contra aid package, was to
be funneled to Nicaragua through the U.S. Agency for International
Development.

<HEAD>Rey Prendes Gets Governing Party Nod To Be Next President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The governing Christian
Democrats on Friday named Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes their candidate
in next year's presidential elections, ignoring warnings that the
party may split.
   The party chief and former Cabinet minister was acclaimed by an
overwhelming majority of the delegates in a raucous congress
punctuated by insults and derisive whistles.
   No other name was proposed. Supporters of Fidel Chavez Mena, Rey
Prendes' bitter rival in the centrist party fight, boycotted the
nominating congress, claiming it was stacked in favor of Rey
Prendes.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte, the party's honorary president,
did not attend. He had urged both Rey Prendes and Chavez Mena to
step aside and let Abraham Gonzalez, an elderly party leader, be
the unity candidate. Both candidates rejected that suggestion.
   Under law, Duarte could not run for a second five-year term. He
won the presidency in the midst of a leftist civil war against the
U.S.-supported conservative government that began in 1980 and
continues.
   The number of delegates eligible to vote was 1,099. Some had
left the Sheraton Hotel auditorium by the time the vote was taken,
but hundreds of delegates raised their credentials when Rey
Prendes' name was put to the vote.
   Those opposed, including some of the party's top leaders,
mustered only 56 votes in favor of postponing the decision on a
candidate.
   The National Convention comprising about 180 delegates later
unanimously ratified Rey Prendes' nomination.
   ``If this congress makes a decision today, this party is not
going to divide, it is going to shatter,'' said Aquilino Duarte, a
member of the party's 10-member Political Committee, or
directorate. He is the minister of commerce and the president's
nephew.
   He and three other committee members urged delaying a decision
to give party leaders time to heal deep rifts caused by the rivalry.
   Roberto Viera of the Political Committee said the Christian
Democrats were dooming themselves to defeat in the March election.
   He was booed as he warned, ``If we make this decision and the
party splits, the people will not have a democratic option in the
presidential election.''
   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, defeated
the Christian Democrats last month in legislative and municipal
elections, putting Arena in a good position to win the presidential
election.
   Arena's detractors accuse it of being authoritarian. The party
rejects the charge, likening its ideology to that of the U.S.
Republicans.
   Arena will choose its presidential candidate in September.
   When Rey Prendes, a wealthy businessman and full-time
politician, mounted the podium to accept the nomination, most of
those who had supported postponement walked out.
   ``I'm sure that once tempers cool, we'll all be together again
in the struggle,'' Rey Prendes told the delegates. ``Let the anger
end today.''
   ``My arms are open. There is no need to exclude anyone,'' he
said in what was taken as a reference to Chavez Mena.
   But Guillermo Guevara Lacayo, a Political Committee member,
predicted Chavez Mena would try to have the congress and convention
annulled.
   Rey Prendes controls most of the party bureaucracy. He is a
former minister of communications, former mayor of San Salvador and
a member of the Political Committee. He and Chavez Mena helped
found the party in 1960.

   A 10-year-old girl hit by a car that careened
across a crowded schoolyard died Friday, bringing the death toll
from the accident to three.
   A 4-year-old and a woman waiting for her grandchildren were
killed Thursday in the accident at the Cyrus H. McCormick
Elementary School. Seven other children were injured.
   On Friday, grieving children and teachers gathered quietly at
the school. Many of the 800 students stayed home, said kindergarten
teacher Argelia Vera, tearful as she hugged a parent on the
sidewalk before classes began.
   ``We are very sorry. We don't know what to think. It's
horrible,'' she said.
   ``It was awful. I didn't even want to come to school today. I
thought the car would still be there,'' said Sam Galarza, 12, a
sixth-grader.
   Galarza said he saw the accident that occurred just after the
school bell signaled the end of classes. A woman's car jumped the
curb, crashed through a chain-link fence and slammed into the
entrance of an annex as children were leaving.
   ``I seen the lady fly up in the air when the car hit her,'' the
boy said, adding he watched Principal Jim Crowe and others lift the
car to free people trapped underneath.
   The third person fatally injured in the accident, 10-year-old
Maria Moya, who had suffered head and chest injuries, died at Cook
County Hospital Friday afternoon, said night administrator Don
Trotter.
   Six other children, ages 5 to 9, remained hospitalized Friday in
good or fair condition, while a 29-year-old woman who was at the
school to pick up her son was treated and released Thursday.
   The driver of the car, Isabel Fuentes, 37, was charged with
leaving the scene of an accident and negligent driving, according
to Police Officer Terry Pickens. She was released after posting
$100 cash bond and her driver's license.
   Police said they believe Mrs. Fuentes was driving above the 20
mph speed limit. There was no evidence of intoxication or other
drug use, they said.
   An examination of the car revealed no evidence of mechanical
malfunction, Sgt. Thomas Reynolds said Friday. ``It's apparent
driver error,'' he said.
   Mrs. Fuentes' attorney, Lawrence Morrissey, said the facts in
the case would emerge eventually, but declined further comment.
   Eighth-grader Paul Reyna, 15, whose younger cousin attends the
school, was waiting there for his bus as usual Friday morning.
   ``It feels like a nasty nightmare. The little kids _ they're all
scared,'' he said.
   Third-grade teacher James Bailey, who helped pull people from
underneath the car, said he himself was grieving as he contemplated
trying to help youngsters get over the trauma.
   ``You do the best job you can,'' he said. ``You're not God and
you can't bring them back and heal them.''
   The dead woman was identified as Dolores Torres, between 60 and
65, who suffered severe leg injuries, said Mount Sinai hospital
spokeswoman Diann Smith.
   Crowe said Mrs. Torres, whose grandchildren attended the school,
``waits there every day faithfully to make sure her kids get home
safety.''
   The dead child was Veronica Marquez, 4, who suffered head and
abdominal injuries, said Cook County Hospital spokeswoman Wanda
Robertson.

   The Labor Department proposed Friday making
employers put warning tags or locks on machinery as it is being
cleaned or serviced _ nine years after unions requested the
regulation and more than 1,000 deaths later as a result of its
absence.
   The proposed regulations, which the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration estimates will save 122 lives and prevent
60,000 injuries annually, had languished at the White House for
nearly a year.
   Their publication in the Federal Register on Friday occurred
just one week after Senate Labor Committee Chairman Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., cited them in congressional hearings as an
example of the Reagan administration's ``decision to let workers
die while waiting on a standard.''
   Employers under the proposal would have to adopt uniform
procedures to ``lock out'' or ``tag out'' switches, valves or other
controls to prevent the start up of machines while they are being
cleaned or serviced.
   OSHA officials estimated about 7 percent of all occupational
fatalities and 2 per cent of accident-caused injuries in the
workplace occur now because such equipment is inadvertently
restarted while someone is working on it.
   ``This rule would mean safer working conditions for millions of
employees in general industry,'' Assistant Labor Secretary and OSHA
Administrator John A. Pendergrass said Friday.
   ``Very simple lockout, tagout measures, which take only a few
minutes, can prevent up to 10 percent of all the serious injuries
in some major manufacturing industries,'' Pendergrass said.
   The agency said the regulations will apply to some 1.6 million
employers and cover an estimated 39 million workers at an estimated
total annual cost of $135 million to businesses.
   They are aimed chiefly at machine operators and laborers who
work around packaging and wrapping equipment, conveyors and
printing presses, which are associated with the highest proportion
of the accidents, OSHA officials said.
   As an example, the agency cited one worker who had leaned his
head into a flour batch mixer and whose neck was crushed when
another worker inadvertently turned the machine on.
   The so-called ``performance-oriented'' regulations would require
employers only to follow certain steps in turning off equipment and
``minimize'' the potential for inadvertently reactivating it.
   Unions that began petitioning the agency for the regulations in
1979 had wanted it to mandate as law specific procedures developed
by the American National Standards Institute in 1982.
   However, OSHA said it would include the ANSI standards only as
``detailed voluntary guidelines'' in an appendix to the
regulations. The agency noted that business groups had wanted the
ANSI standards eliminated entirely from the appendix out of fears
that a court might later interpret them as mandatory.
   John Molovich, a safety specialist for the United Steelworkers
Union, predicted employers will ignore the voluntary guidelines and
``take the cheapest way out'' by using cardboard warning tags
instead of locks to prevent a machine from being turned on.
   ``There will be no positive means of assuring that the equipment
won't start,'' Molovich said of the proposed regulations. ``They
would be better off cutting it into four-inch squares and putting
it in the outhouse.''
   The proposal also exempts millions of companies and workers in
agriculture, oil and gas drilling, electric utilities, the maritime
industry and construction.
   OSHA officials said protections for them will be included in
other regulations to be proposed later.
   James Scully, an OSHA official who worked on the regulations for
more than a decade, testified at the Senate Labor Committee
hearings last week that the agency had first seen a need for them
back in 1977.
   But OSHA took no serious action until 1979, when the United Auto
Workers Union, reacting to the deaths of 22 of its members in
related accidents the previous five years, formally asked the
government for emergency action.
   OSHA denied that request and similar pleas in 1982 and 1986 from
other unions. And Scully told the Senate panel that officials in
the agency were taken off any work on them at all in 1981 and 1982.
   However, OSHA promised in 1983 to issue in 1984 what was
published Friday. Copies of the agency's regulatory agenda showed
similar promises in 1984, 1985 and 1986.
   OSHA officials said Friday that the proposed regulation was sent
to the White House Office of Management and Budget in May 1987 for
approval but was not acted on there until last month.
   The agency estimates it will be a minimum of another year before
the regulations are actually enacted.

<HEAD>Fauci Praises Scientists, But Says Staff Shortages Have Delayed
Drug Trials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the federal agency researching
AIDS drugs said Friday he is basically satisfied with the job
scientists are doing, but acknowledged that some human trials have
been delayed due to lack of money.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House subcommittee on
human resources that about 3,500 AIDS patients are involved in some
30 clinical trials financed with National Institutes of Health
grants.
   ``We're never satisfied, but we think we've done a pretty good
job under the circumstances,'' Fauci said under questioning from
Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., the panel chairman, and other committee
members.
   Pressed by Weiss, Fauci estimated that some trials of AIDS drugs
that could have been started this year were delayed for a year,
pending the new budget cycle, due to staff shortages.
   Fauci said that lack of personnel was ``almost exclusively'' the
reason why still more experimental drugs have not yet entered
clinical trials.
   He said his institute _ one arm of the National Institutes of
Health _ had requested 127 additional staff members for the current
fiscal year, but had received only 11 new slots in the budget
approved by Congress.
   ``The dimension of the shortfall is such that you can't possibly
meet your needs,'' concluded Weiss.
   A bill passed overwhelmingly by the Senate on Thursday would
authorize up to 300 new full-time employees to work on AIDS at the
NIH during the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   However, the level of funds actually appropriated in any budget
hinges on recommendations from the House and Senate appropriations

   Gov. Rose Mofford filed amended
financial-disclosure forms Friday to cover transactions omitted
from sworn documents she filed over the past 10 years, and she
apologized for what she called an honest mistake.
   Mrs. Mofford's predecessor, Evan Mecham, who was impeached and
removed by the Legislature earlier this year, is under criminal
indictment on charges of omitting a $350,000 campaign loan from his
disclosure forms.
   Questions about Mrs. Mofford's forms had been raised a week
earlier by an Associated Press story detailing discrepancies
between her filings and other state and county records, and
Attorney General Bob Corbin began an investigation Monday.
   Failure to file a complete disclosure statement can be a felony
or a misdemeanor under Arizona law.
   The amended forms covered land, loan and partnership
transactions omitted from earlier forms filed by Mrs. Mofford.
   ``I now believe that these items should have been disclosed
earlier,'' she said at a news conference. ``I made an honest
mistake.''
   As secretary of state for 10 years before becoming governor upon
Mecham's impeachment, Mrs. Mofford was in charge of the office
where disclosure forms are filed, and she said that aspect was
especially embarrassing.
   ``I'm very sorry,'' she said. ``I want to emphasize that it was
never my intent to hide anything from anybody.''
   Asked how her position differed from that of Mecham, who said he
made ``an honest mistake'' in failing to list the $350,000 loan and
had not meant to hide anything, Mrs. Mofford replied, ``Mine are
very small amounts of money.''
   As recently as Monday, Mrs. Mofford described reports about the
undisclosed transactions as ``nitpicking.''
   On Friday, however, she said was turning over 150 pages of
documents about transactions to Corbin's office together with
copies of her income tax returns.
   Mrs. Mofford declined to make her tax returns available to
reporters but distributed some papers on all the properties, loans
and partnerships the AP had cited. She also disclosed an interest
in one additional partnership.
   ``On the investigation of the allegations against Rose Mofford,
I have no comment because the matter is under investigation,''
Corbin said.
   Mrs. Mofford said she had decided not to list the items because
her interest in them was linked to T.R. Mofford, whom she divorced
in 1967 but with whom she remained on good terms with until his
death from cancer in 1982.
   She said that her former husband had given her an interest in a
number of properties before his death and that she had paid his
hospital bills ``in excess of $30,000.''
   ``I have never made any profit,'' she said. ``I was paying my
husband's bills.''
   Mrs. Mofford and her aides acknowledged, however, that she had
not listed her former husband's gifts under a reporting section
that requires disclosure of gifts above $500 or, alternatively,
listed the money she advanced to his estate for hospital bills in a
section covering amounts of more than $1,000 owed to or by the
officeholder.
   ``Its a bad judgment call. I admit it. I'm sorry. I hope that I
haven't embarrassed the state,'' she said.
   Mecham did not immediately return messages left at his home and
office.
   Nancy Puffer, founder of a group Mecham supporters known as
Concerned Arizona Voters, said she saw little difference between
Mrs. Mofford's problems and Mecham's, especially given Mrs.
Mofford's 10 years as head of the office that administers
disclosure laws.
   ``You would hope that she would know them backwards and
forwards,'' Ms. Puffer said. ``If anyone is in a position to know
them, it would be her.''
   ``It leaves a little doubt in my mind if she can handle the
office _ how well prepared she is,'' she added.

   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered a
close inspection of the upper skin of older-model Boeing 737s last
October because of cracks near where sections of sheet metal
overlap, warning such cracks could cause rapid cabin decompression.
   The twin-engine Aloha Airlines jetliner that ripped open at
24,000 feet was among the early-model Boeing 737s subject to the
FAA directive as well as to a series of service bulletins by Boeing
outlining the inspection programs, officials said Friday.
   The FAA's concern had been raised last year because routine
inspections turned up cracks near fasteners that join sections of
sheet metal in three aircraft. The same inspections also found
metal strips on the fuselage coming loose on some early-model
Boeing 737s because the lamination was no longer holding.

   While the existence of such complexes has been known for years,
``only recently have we been able to do the full analysis of the
enormous extent of this program _ hundreds of meters deep, with
subways under several cities,'' Carlucci added.
   ``To have something comparable, we'd have to have facilities

   Time, apparently, has passed the operation by.

   A Soviet space shuttle, awaiting its
first test flight, looks remarkably like a clone of its American
predecessor, but there are significant differences.
   To start with, the maiden launch of the Russian vehicle will be
unmanned. When the U.S. shuttle made its debut in 1981, two
astronauts were at the controls.
   Other major differences: The main engines of the Soviet craft
will be on the Energia booster rocket instead of on the orbiter;
the Soviet craft has jet engines that allow it greater
maneuverability on landing and it may have an ejection escape
capsule; the Soviets will not use solid-fuel booster rockets like
the one that destroyed Challenger.
   Defense Department estimates, based on reconnaissance photos,
show a Russian orbiter with dimensions that are within a few feet
of the U.S. vehicle's. The length is calculated at 125.5 feet and
the wingspan at 76 feet, compared with 122.2 feet and 78 feet.
   A 1986 report of the Defense Intelligence Agency showed
side-by-side drawings of the NASA shuttle and the Soviet copy.
Outwardly, they were identical down to the paint trim.
   The Pentagon, in its 1987 report on Soviet military power, said,
``Soviet orbiter development has been heavily dependent on U.S.
orbiter propulsion, computer, materials and airframe design
technology.
   ``By using U.S. technology and designs,'' the report said, ``the
Soviets were able to produce an orbiter years earlier, and at far
less cost, than if they had depended on their own technology. Money
and scientific expertise could thus be diverted to other areas.''
   Alexander I. Dunayev, head of the Soviet space agency
Glavkosmos, said recently the Russian shuttle would be launched
``in the nearest future.''
   ``We are now working quite energetically on testing on land, on
the surface, of the components,'' he told a news conference in
Moscow. ``We are working literally around the clock.''
   Dunayev said the flight would be unmanned and computerized.
   NASA's decision to fly its first shuttle with a crew reflected
the confidence of the agency's design engineers that the orbiter
would work the first time, but only if there were humans aboard.
   Flying the shuttle without astronauts would have required
extensive alterations in the flight computer software so that the
automatic pilot would respond to radio beacons along the route.
   With the program running three years behind schedule and with
financial pressures rising, NASA opted for a manned mission.
Spacecraft in the earlier Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs
underwent extensive unmanned testing before man was committed to
fly them.
   The Soviet shuttle will be boosted by the new Energia
superbooster, which can hoist a 220,000-pound payload into orbit,
equaling the power of America's huge Saturn 5 rocket that was
scrapped after the Apollo moon-landing program.
   The huge rocket passed its first test-launching last May, but
some small problems will have to be overcome on one or two more
launchings before it can carry the shuttle.
   Energia has a central core fueled by hydrogen and four strap-on
liquid-fuel rockets. Either the shuttle or an unmanned cargo vessel
can be carried piggy-back on the rocket.
   The U.S. shuttle has three main hydrogen engines that are part
of the vehicle. They ignite at liftoff along with two solid-fuel
rockets. A faulty solid-fuel rocket joint was blamed for the
explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed its seven crew
members Jan. 28, 1986.
   A disadvantage of the Soviet design is that the engines are not
reuseable because they are jettisoned after liftoff, while NASA
uses shuttle engines repeatedly. An advantage of the design is that
it permits the orbiter to lift more cargo, about 66,000 pounds,
compared with about 55,000 for the U.S. shuttle, and it provides
for installation of landing engines.
   After descending from space, the American shuttle must fly a
steep, high-speed final approach as a powerless glider. If it ever
completed its re-entry without enough energy to reach the runway or
were forced into an unsatisfactory final approach because of
crosswinds or other factors, the crew would have to crash-land the
vehicle.
   The jet engines of the Soviet craft would enable it to make its
final approach at a safer, shallower angle. It would also allow
more maneuvering flexibility in the event of a misalignment with
the runway and permit a second go-around attempt if the first is
unsatisfactory.
   NASA considered the use of jet engines for landing, but cost and
technical tradeoffs early in the program forced abandonment of the
idea.
   Although there is no evidence in Soviet liturature, Jim Oberg, a
Houston aerospace engineer and long-time observer of the Russian
space program, believes the Soviet orbiter may have a blow-away
escape capsule.
   The U.S. shuttle Columbia was fitted with two ejection seats,
like those on jet fighter planes, for its first four test flights.
But those missions had only two-man crews and when the number of
astronauts per flight rose to as many as eight, it was not possible
to provide escape systems for each. The existing two were then
dropped.
   When American shuttle flights resume later this year, the
vehicles will be equipped with a system that would allow the crew
members to bail out if the spacecraft were making a bad landing
approach and had to be ditched. The system includes a rapid blowout
hatch and a telescoping pole that would enable the astronauts to
slide past the potential hazard of striking the wing and then
parachute to safety. The system would not help in a Challenger-like
explosion.
   The Defense Department says the Russians also are developing a
small two-man reuseable spaceplane for swift access to orbit. At
least five subscale models have been tested in orbit and the full
craft is expected to make its first test flight about 1990. It
would be boosted by a SL-X-16 rocket, smaller than Energia, now
undergoing testing.
   In its assessment of Soviet military power, the Pentagon said
this craft could be used for, among other things, ``reconnaissance
missions, satellite repairs and maintenance, crew transport, space
station defense, (and) satellite inspection.''

   Tabatha Foster is organ transplantation's
endearing wonder child, the first person in the world to survive
half a year with virtually all new insides.
   And she's not just surviving, but making her presence felt.
   The 3{-year-old recipient of a record-setting five transplant
organs ignores doctors and nurses after they do something she
dislikes, shows her displeasure by pitching her Pampers to the
floor, and yanks out her intravenous tubes when her mother steps
out of sight.
   She throws tantrums when she's not lifted out of bed as soon as
she demands and resists being undressed by stiffening her arms.
She's not keen about trying different kinds of blended food and,
when she does, always spits out the peas.
   ``She's been spoiled since the day she came into the world. A
lot of her bad habits are going to have to be broken,'' said
Tabatha's mother, Sandra Foster.
   Still, Mrs. Foster and doctors agree that trait is ``what's kept
her, her spunk, her stubbornness.''
   The 36-pound pigtailed toddler from Madisonville, Ky., had most
of her abdomen replaced in experimental surgery at Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh. In the 15-hour operation that ended Nov. 1,
she received a new liver, small intestine and pancreas and parts of
a stomach and colon.
   Similar procedures had been performed only twice before in the
world, both times unsuccessfully.
   A multiple transplant has since been done at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. The
10-month-old patient, Michael Steward of Rockford, Ill., is
reported in good condition. He received a new liver, small
intestine, pancreas and part of a stomach Feb. 9.
   Despite her feistiness, Tabatha's recovery has been far from
smooth. She's been beset during the past six months by a series of
liver problems, a threatening virus and a mysterious three-hour
lapse of consciousness.
   Her latest setback, a buildup of bile in her liver, prompted
doctors in mid-April to insert a drainage tube and downgrade her
condition from fair to serious.
   ``As many small things go wrong, you have to be worried. But I
think on the whole, these two cases certainly indicate the
feasibility of the whole thing,'' said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl,
director of transplant surgery at Children's Hospital and
affiliated Presbyterian-University Hospital.
   ``They're cutting-edge cases, and I'm sure there will be more.''
   Three days after Tabatha was born, doctors removed 95 percent of
her small bowel because of a potentially fatal intestinal
deformity. She was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet,
which damaged her liver.
   Doctors at Children's Hospital determined it would be easier to
replace the entire five-organ group than just Tabatha's liver and
small intestine. The hospital's Human Rights Committee granted
permission Oct. 23 for the risky surgery on humanitarian grounds.
   ``There was no protocol established for this type of
procedure,'' said hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon. ``The
statistics worldwide for people who had undergone similar
operations were not very encouraging.''
   The Fosters needed only a day to make up their minds.
   ``We really didn't have much of a choice,'' said Mrs. Foster,
29. ``I had seen the downfalls (at home) and she bounced back from
them. She's been on death row so many times, and I just knew that
we'd made it this far, there's no sense giving up.''
   On Oct. 31, Tabatha went into surgery to receive the organs of a
7-week-old Virginia girl who had died in an auto accident. She
emerged from the operating room the next day with glowing, healthy
skin, previously yellowed by her malfunctioning liver.
   ``She hadn't been like that for years,'' said her father, Roy
Foster, 36, who has two children from a previous marriage.
   Now, too, she can consume solid food _ baby cereal, vegetables
and fruits and yogurt _ in addition to the liquid diet she receives
intravenously and through a stomach tube.
   Confined to a hospital all but seven weeks of her life, Tabatha
rather likes the attention there, according to her parents.
   Mrs. Foster spends virtually every minute with Tabatha, often
sleeping in a pull-out vinyl chair in the child's private room. Her
husband comes up as much as his job allows.
   ``I think she enjoys being at the nurses' station more than she
does being in the playroom,'' Foster said.
   The feeling is mutual.
   ``Of any kid I've met in or out of this hospital, I think she's
an exceptional child. She's so pleasant, so lovable,'' said Roz
Peck, 23, a registered nurse who regularly surprises Tabatha with
presents. ``I want her to go home. But someone said today, `What
are you going to do when she leaves?''' Nurses aren't the only ones
who have been touched by Tabatha's tale.
   The Fosters, quiet-spoken factory workers, have been overwhelmed
by gifts sent to their daughter _ enough toys to fill 19 big boxes,
two boxes' worth of cards, including notes and drawings from
schoolchildren. Two teddy bears were so huge they had to be sent
home by bus.
   ``It's a shock to me. I just thought we'd get the transplant and
that would be it,'' Mrs. Foster said. ``It's a funny thing.
Everybody knows you and you don't know them.''
   What's even more astounding to the couple is the $355,000 in
donations they have received to help cover Tabatha's medical
expenses. Contributors include President Reagan, Frank Sinatra,
Geraldo Rivera and the rock group Earth, Wind and Fire.
   About 40 percent of the money has come from black churches
throughout the country, according to Joseph K. Williams III, a
Pittsburgh attorney who is serving as trustee of the Tabatha Foster
Fund. Tabatha is black.
   ``We feel that it's the job of the human race to get behind
Tabatha and to support her in her endeavor,'' said the Rev. Gerald
Chapman, chairman of the Pennsylvania State Baptist Association's
fund-raising drive for Tabatha.
   Williams estimates more than $350,000 still is owed the hospital
and bills keep mounting, but officials have indicated the hospital
likely will absorb any unpaid costs since the operation was
experimental and therefore uninsurable.
   The Fosters don't expect Tabatha to be discharged as an
outpatient much before her fourth birthday on June 10. They realize
their worries about infection and organ rejection won't vanish once
they're all back home.
   ``It's a touch-and-go situation,'' Mrs. Foster said, ``and it's
going to be that way for the rest of Tabatha's life.''

<HEAD>Forgery Murders Inspire Rash of Books and TV Movies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One not-yet-published book about the Mark
Hofmann forgery murders has been sold to television and another to
film, but that doesn't bother authors Linda Sillitoe and Allen
Roberts.
   They believe their own volume, ``Salamander: The Story of the
Mormon Forgery Murders,'' is the one that will be read by the
Mormon community which Hofmann betrayed.
   ``The Mormon Murders: A True Story of Greed, Forgery, Deceit and
Death,'' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith and published by
Weidenfeld and Nicolson, is scheduled for August release. It has
been sold to CBS as a possible miniseries.
   ``A Gathering of Saints: A True Story of Money, Murder and
Deceit,'' by Robert Lindsey, has a September publishing date. Film
rights were purchased by 20th Century Fox.
   Roberts, a writer and architect, was a friend of Hofmann's first
victim, a fellow history buff. Sillitoe was a newspaper reporter
who used Roberts as a source early in the Hofmann story.
   Their collaboration began as an effort to explain Hofmann to the
Mormons. Two years and 556 pages later, Signature Books of Salt
Lake City, is seeking to beat two New York publishers out of a
share of the national market.
   ``I think both of us were motivated by a need to know and to
communicate with our own subculture,'' Roberts said, but they
decided later to write for non-Mormon readers as well.
   For six years that unstructured Mormon subculture of about 3,000
scholars, writers, artists and historians had been dazzled and
intrigued by Hofmann's finds of supposedly historical documents
that forced a sometimes painful re-examination of Mormon origins.
   The enigmatic Hofmann's success gave him ready access to the
high church officials numbered among his most avid customers. He
had begun to forge lucrative American historical and literary
documents when, under pressure to produce promised documents that
didn't exist, he turned to murder to cover his tracks.
   His first bomb on Oct. 15, 1985, killed a young Mormon bishop,
Steve Christensen, who had bought and donated Hofmann's most famous
creation, the so-called ``Salamander Letter,'' to the church.
   The ``Salamander Letter'' was purported to have been written by
Martin Harris, an early associate of church founder Joseph Smith.
It gives an account of Smith's finding of gold plates _ from which
he said he translated the ``Book of Mormon'' _ which is contrary to
the official church version. The letter said an ``old spirit''
directed Smith to the plates, then transformed itself into a white
salamander. The official church version has it that an angel named
Moroni directed Smith to the plates in 1827.
   A second bomb, intended to divert suspicion from Hofmann, killed
Kathy Sheets, wife of a former Christensen business partner.
   But a third bomb the next day _ which Hofmann called a suicide
device _ seriously injured its maker and exposed him as the likely
killer. Fifteen months later, in a controversial pre-trial plea
bargain, Hofmann admitted his guilt, detailed his forgeries and was
sentenced to five years to life in prison.
   ``Hofmann was such an equal opportunity rip-off artist ...
because he took everybody for what they were worth,'' said
Sillitoe, who quit her job at the Deseret News in order to work on
the book.
   ``It's not just that he exploited the (Mormon Church's) secrecy
or the paranoia that people criticize, but he also exploited the
faith, and the values and the trust and the belief. Whatever people
had to give, he exploited,'' she said.
   But ``Salamander'' is not merely an indictment of a master
manipulator and forger. The authors sought in their interviews with
some 200 sources to explain who and what had shaped a man for whom
deceit was the means and the end.
   ``I think he had a double difficulty,'' Roberts said. ``His
parentage was first-generation German and very authoritarian. And
then you add to that the fact they were orthodox, conservative
Mormons, which carres another layer of authoritarianism.''
   An inquisitive boy, Hofmann couldn't raise questions in that
environment, Roberts said. Thus, he was a secret agnostic while
serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints and, more than a decade later, fooled a lie detector about
the bombings.
   ``He comes right out of the heart of the culture in every way,''
Sillitoe said. ``And that's what was so fascinating to me about the
story is that everything fed into it _ the history, the theology,
the polygamy, everything. And you've got it right there on the
doorstep of the Church Office Building.''
   The authors sought to interview Hofmann, 33, at Utah State
Prison, where the state Board of Pardons recently told him he will
spend the rest of his life. But the inmate refused.
   Sillitoe and Roberts were somewhat more successful with three
church leaders who figured in the Hofmann story. They provided
written answers to a dozen typed questions. Their reticence was
understandable; Hofmann had cast them, as he had friends and
family, in the role of dupe.
   ``I think there was a strong instinct to protect the
institution,'' said Sillitoe, who regrets that the Hofmann case
seems to have invigorated the faith's ``traditional,
anti-intellectual segment.''
   For Signature Books, ``Salamander'' is unique. The company,
founded in 1981 to publish Mormon-related works, produced just six
titles in 1987 and never has spent more than $15,000 to promote any
one book.
   The Roberts-Sillitoe work has up to $100,000 in advertising. A
publicist has been hired, the authors are touring and there is a
first printing of 15,000 copies, more than double Signature's
previous high.

<HEAD>Breaching the Acting Barrier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daniel J. Travanti, no longer the
tight-lipped Furillo of ``Hill Street Blues,'' is entering a new
phase in his campaign to breach ``that mythical, mystical,
invisible barrier'' that separates television from movie actors.
   Travanti can be seen in theaters this month in ``Midnight
Crossing,'' a mystery thriller from Vestron Pictures. He plays the
husband of Faye Dunaway, who is blinded with glaucoma, and both
embark on a Caribbean yacht cruise that becomes enmeshed in stolen
treasure and murder.
   Travanti discussed his life after ``Hill Street Blues'' at his
Pacific Palisades home where his neighbors are John Forsythe and
Arnold Schwarzenegger. The series has obviously provided Travanti
with prosperity. But it also left him with a new challenge.
   ``The problem for many actors,'' he said, ``is that mystical,
mythical barrier that you have to cross through a misty field.
You're on this side of it and you're called `a television actor.'
Or you're called `a theater actor.' On the other side is the cinema
_ motion pictures, feature films.
   ``Somehow they see you coming and they don't want you to cross
over. I don't know why. Nobody has been able to explain it. They
used to say: `People don't want to pay to see someone when they can
see him free.' That's all changed.
   ``And so you face that strange phenomenon of crossing over that
foggy field and coming out the other side and becoming a `movie
actor.' It has nothing to do with ability necessarily, or how you
look or how you sound. Some make it, and some don't.
   ``Since I finished the series last year, I've done what I wished
I could do. I went from `Midnight Crossing' to a play, `I Never
Sang for My Father,' which had a successful six-month tour. And now
I'm doing another movie with Kris Kristofferson and Cheryl Ladd,
`Millennium.' So by summer I will have done two feature films and a
successful play tour. And my next television appearance will be an
American Playhouse version of the play in June.''
   The actor doesn't worry about escaping the persona of Frank
Furillo.
   ``I did that in the first season of `Hill Street Blues,''' he
said, ``by playing totally different characters in television
movies, `Adam' and `A Case of Libel.' And I also played Edward R.
Murrow on television.
   ``Not all of the characters have been straight-arrow like the
captain. The guy I played in `A Matter of Libel' was ... complex.
... The guy in `Midnight Crossing' is maybe a less-controlled
cousin of that fellow, so to speak. Ed Murrow, one of the heroes of
our time, was also a complicated man, though we couldn't show much
of that in a two-hour movie.''
   Daniel J. Travanti is a late bloomer as an actor.
   ``I charged through college (University of Wisconsin) in three
years with Phi Beta Kappa and every other honor. I knocked my
brains out. I don't know what ... I was rushing toward. No matter
how fast I ran, it turned out I couldn't get there any faster than
I was supposed to.
   ``In New York, it all screeched to a crawl,'' he said. ``Many
actors, who are told they are talented in school or regional
theaters, get to New York City and get stonewalled _ not frozen
out; I worked all the time. I was just so confused and so neurotic
that I drove myself crazy. And I drove others around me crazy.
   ``For a long time I limped along and bumped along and hiccupped
along. I always made a living _ this fall will mark 25 years as an
actor, never having to work as anything else. The big turning point
came 15 years ago when I found sobriety,'' he said, referring to
his alcoholism.
   ``I don't want to belabor that, because I don't want it to be an
overpowering identity of mine. But I am willing to mention it and
talk about it privately.
   ``Since then it's been a matter of patiently trudging, chugging,
moving steadily along and hoping for a break.''

<HEAD>Yugoslavia at Critical Crossroads Amid Severe Economic Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavs are at a crossroads, and
the way they turn could mean profound changes in the route Josip
Broz Tito mapped out for them when he founded the communist state
after World War II.
   The road Yugoslavia takes is likely to depend on the outcome of
a fierce public struggle between Communist Party hardliners and
reformers demanding changes, including market-oriented economic
policies, pluralistic politics and greater links with Western
Europe.
   But right now, political disarray is paralyzing decision-making
at a time of deep economic crisis, the worst ever in Yugoslavia's
postwar history.
   The nation is grappling with an inflation rate of 170 percent,
Europe's highest, and a $20 billion foreign debt.
   Living standards for a people once well off by East European
standards have declined by a third since 1980 and about 1.1 million
people, about 15 percent of the work force, are looking for jobs.
   The outcome of the clash between hardliners and reformers could
have deep meaning not only for 23.2 million Yugoslavs but also for
other East European nations, some of which face similar, but less
pressing, decisions in the era of reform laid down by General
Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Union.
   Yugoslavia is officially a non-aligned nation that functions
independently of Moscow's East bloc and has closer links to the
West than the Soviet allies.
   Hardliners here are contending that reformers' demands would
mean a restoration of capitalism in Yugoslavia, although the
reformers say they remain socialists.
   Dobrica Cosic, a reformer and former prominent communist who is
now Yugoslavia's best-selling author, has described the country as
``a gravely ill Balkan patient with an uncertain future.''
   ``The fate of Yugoslavia will be decided in a struggle between
repressive and conservative authorities ... who will use all
available means to defend the existing regime'' and forces ``that
strive for an enlightened, civilized, pluralistic socialism _ for a
modern society and democratic Yugoslavia,'' he was quoted by the
official news agency Tanjug as telling a group of Serbian writers.
   Cosic did not specify what he meant by ``all available means,''
but many Yugoslavs took him to mean the use of police or even
military repression to keep public criticism and dissent from
spreading.
   Cosic, a World War II partisan who was purged from the Communist
Party's Central Committee in the late 1960s, spoke at a Serbian
writers meeting during which proposals were made for amending the
constitution adopted in 1974 while Tito was alive and the nation's
sole leader.
   The constitution granted wide autonomy to the country's six,
often fractious republics and two provinces.
   The document is generally blamed for the today's problems. It
created a virtual confederation in which each constituent region
has power to veto important decisions. The result is endless
arguments and deadlocks on key issues. Even the nation's presidency
is rotated among the regions.
   According to Tanjug, Cosic maintained that the existing system
is ``only a semblance of a socialist society _ in reality it is a
state of organized chaos, which has antagonized our peoples and
republics ... and which has caused our economy to slide into total
unprofitability.''
   A joint statement by unions of Serbian writers, philosophers and
sociologists, adopted at the meeting, called for an end to the
Communist Party's monopoly in Yugoslavia, a one-party state like
other East European countries.
   Recently, a number of leading intellectuals in Serbia, the
largest republic, and Slovenia, the most economically developed
region, called on the Communist Party to permit some degree of
political pluralism as one way of overcoming economic and political
problems.
   It was the first time that official groups had issued any
written statement of that kind.
   The state-run press and Communist Party officials assailed the
intellectuals' statement and Cosic's speech, charging that they
represent an attempt to subvert the government.
   The authorities reacted even more sharply to criticism in
Slovenia's media of the army and the state security service.
   A number of articles published in the Slovenian press,
particularly in the liberal youth periodical Mladina, had denounced
the army as an undemocratic, pro-Soviet institution prepared to
stage a military coup.
   Defense Minister Branko Mamula and several high-ranking military
officials had previously voiced concern about what they saw as a
deterioration in the economic and political situations.
   The communist leadership responded to the attacks on the army
and security forces with sharp warnings against such criticism and
called for legal action against it.
   The official reaction culminated in early April when a
parliamentary commission responsible for state security denounced
the critical articles as part of an international conspiracy to
overthrow the government.
   Jelena Lovric, a prominent political columnist for Danas, widely
considered the most liberal state-run periodical, rejected that
official claim.
   She said the real danger for the government stemmed from the
domestically triggered economic crisis and that the claim of
foreign-backed conspiracies ``is creating chaos and sowing fear
among the already frightened populace.''
   ``Are such panicky assertions about anti-socialist conspiracies
not in fact aimed at creating the conditions for use of all
available measures?'' she wrote in a commentary, apparently
alluding to Cosic's remarks.
   At a recent meeting Milan Kucan, leader of the more liberal
Slovenian Communist Party, contended that Yugoslavia's
``unvanquished crisis'' is jeopardizing the country's communist
system.
   ``Changes, radical ones, are more than necessary,'' Tanjug
quoted Kucan as saying.
   Communists in Slovenia have been the most outspoken in offering
unorthodox proposals for the country's problems, including a more
market-oriented economy and closer ties with Western Europe.
   In April, Slovenia's Parliament began a procedure to force
Premier Branko Mikulic's federal government out of office on
grounds that its economic policies were ineffective. The action was
the first of its kind in postwar Yugoslavia.
   Communist Party officials in other Yugoslav republics maintained
that the Slovenian legislative action would mean a return of
capitalism.
   Responing in an interview to that contention, Slovenia's
president-elect, Janez Stanovnik, said: ``Those who follow events
in Slovenia from the outside see enemies and counterrevolutionaries
everywhere, while we here are feeling ... the enthusiasm of a
democratic reform.''

<HEAD>Conspiracy Between Father, Son Led to Rural Bankers' Murders, Book
Concludes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BAENEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When two bankers were gunned down in a 1983
ambush on an abandoned southwest Minnesota farm, some speculated
that bitterness about the farm crisis was behind the violence.
   But a new book contends that a conspiracy between a failed dairy
farmer whose marriage had crumbled and his militaristic teen-age
son _ not the rural economic crisis _ triggered the killings.
   ``I look at the killings as being the final outcome of a broken
family and broken identities,'' said Joseph Amato, 49, the book's
author and a history professor at Southwest State University in
Marshall.
   ``When Father and Son Conspire: A Minnesota Farm Murder''
concentrates on the relationship between James Jenkins and his
18-year-old son, Steven, and discounts the farm crisis of the 1980s
as a major factor in the murders.
   Amato said in an interview that he became intrigued by the case
because ``it just seemed to be very peculiar that a father and son
would get together and ambush a man.'' His journalistic account of
the killings took 2{ years to research and write.
   Published in March by Iowa State University Press, the 226-page
book is now in a second printing of 3,000 copies after selling out
a first run of 2,500, according to Neelum Chaudhry, the publisher's
advertising and publicity manager.
   As former director of Southwest State's rural studies program,
Amato said he was familiar with the problems facing farmers. He
also knew the terror that swept the Minnesota prairie the night of
the killings.
   ``Doors that hadn't been locked in memory were locked. People
who really didn't like neighbors slept over at their house that
night,'' he said.
   On the morning of Sept. 29, 1983, Rudolph Blythe Jr. and Deems
``Toby'' Thulin were shot to death on a 10-acre abandoned dairy
farm near the small town of Ruthton in the southwest corner of
Minnesota.
   Blythe was president of Buffalo Ridge State Bank in Ruthton,
which had taken over the farm abandoned by James Jenkins in 1980.
Thulin was Blythe's chief loan officer. The two were lured to the
deserted farm by a telephone caller who said he was interested in
the property.
   Two men were seen fleeing the farm in a white pickup truck, and
a search began for James Jenkins and his son. Three days later,
Steven Jenkins surrendered to authorities in Paducah, Texas. He led
authorities to an abandoned farm where his 46-year-old father was
found dead of a shotgun blast. The death was ruled a suicide by
Texas authorities.
   Amato portrays the two men as frustrated by lost dreams, working
each other into a rage.
   The elder Jenkins' marriage had recently collapsed and he had
declared bankruptcy. Amato speculates that the younger Jenkins, a
high school dropout, was upset that a spleen injury suffered in an
accident might end his dream of joining the military.
   ``This father worked this son up and this son either used his
father or exploited his father,'' Amato said. He maintains that
tension between the two men was the cause of the killings. ``I
think this father brought out the aggression in the son.''
   For the two, Amato said, the crime may have been the ``last lie
they shared together. And the lie was, `I'll have a farm and you'll
be a soldier.'''
   Amato argues that the farm crisis played a minor role. He notes
that James Jenkins failed as a farmer in 1980, several years before
the farm crisis reached its peak. Though a hard worker and clever
handyman, Amato said, the elder Jenkins failed ``when just about
anyone would have made it farming.''
   Amato's theories differ markedly from those of a previous book
on the killings.
   ``Final Harvest: An American Tragedy,'' published in 1986, links
the killings to the farm crisis. That book's author, Andrew H.
Malcolm of The New York Times, declined to comment on Amato's book.
   Steven Jenkins' mother, Darlene Abraham, and sister, Michele
Schewe, issued a statement about the book:
   ``Mr. Amato did a fairly credible job of gathering the facts
available, along with opinions and misinformation and weaving them
into `a story' to support his Greek tragedy.
   ``In the `conspiracy' chapter he tells us in detail and depth of
Steven and James' innermost thoughts and feelings. How can an
accurate description of either be possible when he's never met nor
spoken to the father or the son? We strongly disagree with the
portrayal of Steve. Steve is innocent.''
   Steven Jenkins himself declined to be interviewed about the book.
   Amato speculates that James Jenkins lured the banker to the farm
to either kidnap or terrorize him. The bank president and his loan
officer apparently surprised the father and son by arriving earlier
than expected.
   According to the prosecution's scenario at Steven Jenkins' 1984
trial, the teen-ager fired his M-1 carbine at Thulin, killing the
loan officer, then chased Blythe across the yard and cut him down
with a second volley.
   The prosecution argued that Steven Jenkins, who liked
Marine-type haircuts, camouflage fatigues and tattoos, was the
triggerman. The younger Jenkins was obsessed with guns, explosives
and the military, and slept with the murder weapon in his room. His
father was unfamiliar with guns, had poor eyesight and wasn't fit
enough to have chased Blythe, the prosecution contended.
   A Lincoln County jury agreed that Steven Jenkins pulled the
trigger. He was convicted of first- and second-degree murder and
sentenced to life in prison. He becomes eligible for parole in
2001, when he will be 36.

<HEAD>`Necessity' Great Opportunity for Fans of Unintentional Humor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With just a touch-up here and there,
``Necessity'' could be a fine satire on the made-for-TV movie genre.
   ``Necessity'' stars Loni Anderson as a model named Lauren
LaSalle who is living an idyllic life with husband and darling baby
girl when, suddenly, after several years of marriage, she realizes
that her husband is a cocaine dealer.
   Apparently she has never asked why he has a helicopter and
several hit men hanging around their fabulous upstate New York
house.
   While this woman is clearly no mental giant, she does figure out
how to swipe $2 million of hubby's drug money, establish a new
identity in California and launder the funds through stock market
transactions.
   But ``Necessity'' does intend to be taken seriously. Just to
double check, CBS calls it a ``drama of shattered illusions.''
Luckily for those involved, the movie airs Tuesday night, CBS'
black hole of ratings, so no one, neither friends nor colleagues
nor relatives, nor anyone else for that matter, need ever know.
   Back to Lauren, who, once ensconced in Los Angeles, takes flying
lessons. Is she going to forget the kid and start a new life as a
commercial airline pilot? No way! She's going to go back to New
York and swoop down and pluck her child from the evil influences of
her husband, who is busy obsessing in artful double exposures about
the wrong she has done him.
   Which brings us to the subject of bizarre casting.
   James Naughton, who plays the ``dese-and-dose'' drug dealing
husband, most recently starred in Paul Newman's film of ``The Glass
Menagerie.'' No flies on him.
   John Heard, who plays Charlie, the lovable flying instructor,
can currently be seen in Robert Redford's film ``The Milagro
Beanfield War.''
   Both are fine stage actors. Are their agents telling them they
better grab this turkey while they can, since they might never work
again? A really dumb made-for-TV movie starring Loni Anderson?
Sure, sign us up!
   Well, maybe at least they thought it was a satire.
   Anyway, Charlie must tell Lauren, who is quite good at
high-speed car chases, that she's nevertheless just too darn dumb
to operate an airplane.
   Since Charlie has a kid of his own, and can use $50,000, he
agrees to pilot the baby-napping plane himself.
   The getaway goes awry, of course, so Lauren slaps baby in a car
seat and takes off on a high-speed truck-helicopter chase through
the hills and vales. Lauren apparently believes it is better to
risk Baby's neck stunt-driving over brushy cliffs and mowing down
fences than leave her to grow up on daddy's drug money.
   All this set-up is just so wonderfully kitsch, it's hard to
believe the ending is even better. In fact, it's so good, it's
worth taping, just for the slow-mo dialogue and 12 gunshots pumped
into a victim who stands up and grabs his shoulder.
   This is serious, isn't it?

   YES, WE HAVE NO SWEEPS ORIGINALS _ In lieu of the May 2-6 trip
to London that was quashed by the writers' strike, the
still-in-repeats ``Late Night with David Letterman'' will spend the
first week of the important May ratings period reprising shows that
featured Dave in suits made of odd substances such as velcro,
sponges, magnets and Alka-Seltzer. Who says television is a
wasteland? ...
   `M&W' DOES NOT STAND FOR `MONEY AND WEAPONS' _ Fawn Hall, former
secretary to Lt. Col. Oliver North and who was a smash hit at last
year's Iran-Contra hearings, becomes a TV star of a different kind
when she makes her debut as co-host of ``M&W,'' an ABC special
examining ``our contemporary world.'' The special is set to air in
June. Hall's segment is a visit to a European heiress who gave up
her inheritance to marry a Masai warrior and live in Kenya. Jane
Seymour and Katie Wagner also are featured. The show is based on
``M'' and ``W'' magazines and is produced by Don Mischer. ...
   HULK REDUX _ Old TV series don't die, they come back as
made-for-TV movies, and the latest is ``The Incredible Hulk.'' Bill
Bixby and Lou Ferrigno reprise their roles from the 1978-82 series
for a two-hour movie May 22 on NBC, in which Dr. Banner (Bixby) has
finally got that pesky temper that turns into the Hulk (Ferrigno)
under control. Unfortunately, while working in his lab, another
scientist accidentally channels the spirit of the Viking thunder
god, Thor. Thunder gods being what they are, the Hulk is
re-awakened. No, we don't make these things up.

   Ancient custom permits one woman in Kenya
to take another as a ``wife,'' but a divorce case involving two
such women has thrown up a challenge to Kenya's Western-style legal
system.
   The case involves Wanjiru Gutu, a barren widow, who 10 years ago
took Mary Njeri Macharia as a ``wife'' to bear her the children she
desperately wanted.
   The relationship went sour and the women have asked a
Western-style divorce court to sort out their broken marriage,
including the question of alimony, child support and property
settlement.
   ``We don't have a precedent for this case,'' said Paul Mberi,
Ms. Macharia's lawyer.
   ``The problem we have is that our legal system as practiced in
the courts is changing to the Western legal system. But at the same
time, in the village we are living with people whose arrangements
are based on customary law concepts.''
   Marriage between women is not uncommon in Kenya and neither is
divorce.
   But this case is unique because the couple has turned to Western
laws, instead of adhering to custom and letting tribal elders
decide the issue.
   Barren women, such as Ms. Gutu, often take one or more fertile
women as ``wives'' to bear children, which the female ``husband''
then claims as her own. Even married women make such arrangements,
with the husband of the barren woman fathering children by his
spouse's wife.
   Barren women often are ostracized in Africa, where wealth and
prestige still are measured by the number of children a couple has.
   Since both Ms. Macharia and Ms. Gutu were single, Ms. Macharia
was entitled to choose the man to father the children.
   For the surrogate mother, such an arrangement offers the
security of a home and income.
   Ms. Macharia, in her late 20s, was a single mother of two
children, aged 12 and 10, when she married Ms. Gutu and took her
surname. She brought them to Ms. Gutu's home and had two more
children, now 7 and 5.
   After a fierce quarrel in January 1986, Ms. Gutu chased her
``wife'' from their matrimonial home in the western Kenyan town of
Nakuru, according to court records.
   Before turning to the Western-style courts, Ms. Macharia twice
went to a court of tribal elders, asking for alimony and child
support or a share of Ms. Gutu's property, including a small
grocery store.
   Ms. Gutu, about 60, complained that Ms. Macharia beat her,
threatened her life and stole from the business.
   Both times the elders ruled that Ms. Macharia could keep the
children but should receive nothing else.
   ``This was not a hardship in the past, as the woman would go
back to her father and his community, which jointly owned and
shared land and resources,'' explained Gibson Kamau Kuria, a
Nairobi lawyer who specializes in family law.
   Ms. Macharia did return to her father, a peasant farmer near
Nakuru. But when she felt that she and the children were a burden,
she sued her former ``husband'' for divorce in the district
magistrate's court, again demanding alimony and child support or a
share of Ms. Gutu's property.
   She filed suit in August 1986, but the case has been delayed by
a backlog and is expected to be heard soon.
   Ms. Gutu had told the tribal courts Ms. Macharia had no money or
property when they married, and that the relationsip gave her
status and a comfortable lifestyle.
   Odhiambo Ochieng', Ms. Gutu's lawyer, argues in an affidavit
that because the marriage is recognized only by customary law, only
a traditional solution is possible: for Ms. Macharia to return to
her father's family with nothing.
   Kenya's very diversity is at the root of the now-budding legal
problems.
   The East African nation's 22 million people are divided among
dozens of ethnic groups who abide by Islamic, Hindu and various
tribal customary laws in addition to the statutory Western laws
inherited from British colonizers at independence 25 years ago.
   A case last year pitted the widow of a prominent lawyer, S.M.
Otieno, against his Luo clansmen in a tussle over whether the widow
or the tribe should bury him. The High Court ruled that in the
absence of written law, customary law prevails.
   Otieno's widow lost.
   ``These problems are going to have to be tackled and will not go
away until Kenya is lived in by an overall younger and more modern
generation,'' Ochieng' said.

<HEAD>Congressional Pay Amendment Creeps Toward Washington</HEAD>

   A 199-year-old proposed constitutional amendment that would
delay pay raises that members of Congress give themselves until
voters have a say is being spurred toward Washington by a college
student who says he's tired of the ``sneaky'' way the pay hikes now
come about.
   The amendment has been approved by 23 state legislatures. Asked
what will happen if the required three-fourths majority of states
ratify it, a congressional researcher replied, ``I don't know.''
   ``It's a sleeper,'' said West Virginia legislator David
McKinley, who this year added his state to the roll call of those
ratifying the amendment. Georgia also approved it in 1988.
   The amendment, first proposed in 1789 by the framers of the
Constitution as part of a 12-amendment Bill of Rights, states: ``No
law varying the compensation for the services of the senators and
representatives shall take effect, until an election of
representatives shall have intervened.''
   By 1791, six states had ratified it: Maryland, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Delaware, Vermont and Virginia. The bandwagon
stalled until 1873, when Congress bestowed on itself a whopping
raise and Ohio ratified the amendment. Wyoming approved it 1978.
   Then, in 1982, along came Gregory Watson, a University of Texas
student who was researching a term paper on the death of the Equal
Rights Amendment when he was sidetracked ``by this little book that
said five or six amendments never had been ratified.''
   In the dustbin with the congressional pay proposal were
amendments allowing slavery, prohibiting U.S. citizens from
accepting titles of nobility and outlawing child labor.
   ``With the December 1981 fiasco still fresh in my mind _ when
Congress gave itself a special tax break which no other American
would enjoy _ I thought, `Gregory, why don't you try to get this
ratified?'''
   Watson mailed letters to state legislators. In Maine, then-state
Sen. Melvin Shute wrote back.
   The next year, Shute introduced a resolution ratifying the 1789
amendment. ``Boom, it passed,'' Watson said.
   Excited by success in Maine, Watson sent more letters and found
more legislators willing to propose resolutions backing the
amendment.
   Colorado joined in 1984, followed by South Dakota, New
Hampshire, Arizona, Tennessee and Oklahoma in 1985. New Mexico,
Indiana and Utah ratified in 1986, and Montana, Connecticut and
Wisconsin in 1987 _ when Congress gave itself two pay raises.
   Ratification resolutions have been introduced in every state but
Arkansas, Watson said.
   ``I think the average American feels the way I do,'' Watson
said. ``You shouldn't begrudge a member of Congress from getting a
fair wage. What I object to is the sneaky, tricky, cutesy way they
hide these raises.''
   He referred to last year's maneuvering, in which the Senate and
then the House made token votes refusing $12,100 pay raises and
then pocketed the money. Consumer advocates attacked House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, for delaying the vote until its results no
longer mattered.
   Congress had already given itself a 3 percent increase last
year, to compensate for inflation. Members of Congress now make
$89,500.
   ``I think people are disgusted with the Congress,'' said Georgia
state Sen. Paul Coverdell, who helped ratify the amendment in his
state this year. ``Greg Watson has made an obsession out of
rectifying the situation.''
   Not everyone feels so strongly.
   Even James Madison, who made the pay stricture part of his
proposed Bill of Rights, argued for it somewhat half-heartedly _
possibly a reason why it isn't among the 10 amendments that became
the Bill of Rights.
   ``I do not believe this is a power which in the ordinary course
of government will be abused,'' Madison said, ``... but there is a
seeming impropriety in leaving any set of men without control to
put their hands in the public coffers.''
   West Virginia legislator James Humphries, calling the resolution
``frivolous,'' tried to kill it in committee.
   ``It's as moldy as 6-month-old bread!'' he contended.
   Kansas state Rep. Robert H. Miller has refused to let the
resolution out of his Federal and State Affairs Committee.
   ``We consider tinkering with the U.S. Constitution pretty
serious stuff. I'm not going to do it based on the word of some guy
from Texas,'' said Miller, who called the amendment a ``non-issue.''
   Opposition to the amendment is fueled by self-interest, said
Georgia's Coverdell. Before this year's success, his attempts to
achieve ratification were blocked in committee for three years.
   ``I guess the committee members all hoped to be in Congress,''
he said.
   Nonetheless, he said, ``It's like apple pie and motherhood.
Nobody was willing to oppose it. But I can tell you I got no
support.''
   What happens if Watson's amendment wins ratification in the
required 38 states and gets to Washington?
   ``I don't know,'' said David Huckabee, a Congressional Research
Service analyst. But the amendment, which has no deadline, is bound
to be a sore spot, he said.
   ``If Congress chooses to not accept the ratification because
it's so old, there's a question of whether you could get enough
legal footing to get it into court. It's possible that the courts
might not want to enter into the fray,'' Huckabee said.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., backs the issue,
``but I have some question as to whether the courts would uphold
such an old amendment since some of the ratifications are so
ancient.''
   If need be, Byrd said, he will re-introduce the measure to
ensure courts uphold it.
   Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., is trying to do just that in
the House, but his amendment remains in the House Judiciary
Committee, said his aide, John Doherty.
   ``I think it's basically self-interest,'' Doherty said of the
opposition. ``It's amazing how little support there is for this,
but nobody (publicly) opposes it.''
   Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., who chaired the House committee
endorsing the last raise and who was quoted as saying the raise was
``too damn little,'' remains silent on the amendment.
   ``I'm not certain if he cares to say anything on this,'' said
his aide, Tom Joyce.
   Although Watson, now 25, said he received a ``C'' on his term
paper from a professor who didn't think the amendment was much of
an issue, Huckabee saw a broader meaning in the student's efforts.
   ``This is quite a civics lesson,'' he said, ``that one person
can make a difference.''

<HEAD>The Pulitzer Collection of Modern Art on Exhibit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN J. MULLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Joseph Pulitzer Jr. was an
undergraduate at Harvard University in 1935, he bought a striking
painting by Modigliani, beginning an extraordinary collection of
modern art.
   The collection grew to more than 250 paintings, drawings and
sculptures in the ensuing half-century. Pulitzer recently returned
to Harvard for the opening of an exhibit featuring 86 of his those
works.
   More than 40 artists are represented in the exhibit, which will
be at Harvard's Fogg Museum until June 12 when it moves to the
Saint Louis Art Museum in Missouri from July 8 through Aug. 28.
   ``There are perhaps only three or four museums in the country
who could put together, from their own collections, a display to
match the depth and breadth of this one,'' said Edgar Peters
Bowron, director of the Harvard University Art Museums.
   Included are 12 works by Picasso, four each by Monet, Klee and
Miro; three each by Degas, Matisse, Lipchitz and Lichtenstein; and
pieces by Cezanne, Brancusi, Pollock and Warhol.
   ``I wanted to buy creative art that would have a validity and
vitality that would transcend fashion,'' said Pulitzer, whose
grandfather's will established the Pulitzer Prizes in journalism
and the arts.
   ``I was much more interested in the living rather than going
deeply into the past,'' he said, explaining why he chose to collect
modern art.
   A fine arts major at Harvard, Pulitzer graduated in 1936 and
joined the staff of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He became its
editor and publisher and now is chairman of the Pulitzer Publishing
Co.
   He has been generous with his purchases, giving pieces to
museums, including the Fogg and the Saint Louis Art Museum, which
has that first Modigliani, ``Elvira Resting at a Table.'' Some
remain at his home.
   ``Joe started (collecting) from the purest of reasons _ love of
art,'' said Michael Shapiro, chief curator of the Saint Louis Art
Museum.
   ``And, he's not cashing in his chips,'' Shapiro added, referring
to collectors who sell for profit.
   Shapiro, Bowron and Judith Weiss-Levy, curator of prints,
drawings and photographs at the Saint Louis Museum, made the
selections from the Pulitzer collection to put in the exhibit.
   ``It was intended to demonstrate the quality and range of the
collection,'' Bowron said of their choices, and noted that Pulitzer
also had a say.
   ``We made the initial selection, but then Joe, with his unerring
eye, said, `You must put in this one and that one,''' Bowron said.
   Installing the exhibit was difficult because the works were so
varied in size, media and style.
   One perspective on the exhibit, said Shapiro, is that Pulitzer
bought the Modigliani four years before Richard Serra, who has a
painting, a drawing and a sculpture in the show, was born.
   ``The collection is very much a synopsis of mainstream modernism
and its evolving,'' Shapiro said.
   ``In a certain sense we distilled them (the selections) out of
Joe's distillation, a summary history of modern art in Europe and
America. It is a history of modern art.''
   The exhibit also marks the publication by the Harvard University
Art Museums of the fourth volume of the catalog of the Pulitzer
collection.
   It was written by Angelica Zander Rudenstine, a curator and
scholar and, as a member of the visiting committee, an adviser to
Harvard's fine arts department.
   ``I have said ... to Angelica, if she ever departs from, her
profession as art historian, I would like to hire her for the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch as an investigative reporter,'' Pulitzer said.

   If current corporate earnings were the only
determinant of trends in stock prices, the market would surely be
thriving right now.
   Companies in a wide variety of industries, big names and small,
have lately posted strong profit gains for the first quarter.
   And most analysts agree that the earning outlook remains bright
for the balance of the year.
   Standard & Poor's Corp. calculates that the several hundred
companies included in its industrial index chalked up a 39 percent
increase in profits last year. For 1988, it estimates a further 21
percent gain.
   The earnings picture has been much stronger than would be
suggested by the pace of overall economic growth in the United
States, which has been moderate at most.
   As Robert S. Salomon Jr. at the investment firm of Salomon
Brothers Inc. observed: ``Recent cost-cutting and streamlining have
produced earnings increases that have oustripped the economy's
sluggish pace.''
   A weak dollar has helped industrial America gain a better
competitive position in world markets.
   Prominent companies like DuPont and Johnson & Johnson, to cite
two examples from the past few days, have accompanied their latest
reports with announcements of dividend increases.
   But while the earnings trend may be causing great cheer in
executive suites around the country, it has met with a chilly
reception on Wall Street, where stock prices continue to drift
around aimlessly on low volume.
   ``The market hasn't yet rewarded positive surprises, but has
punished disappointments,'' said Melissa Brown at Prudential-Bache
Securities.
   This is hardly the first time, of course, that the stock market
has been seemingly out of synch with the producing and consuming
economy.
   The question investors have to grapple with is not how earnings
are doing now, but what they will look like six months, a year or
more in the future.
   Just how far ahead the market, in its collective vision, can
``see'' is a matter of long-standing debate.
   It can be argued that many of the gains now being posted in
corporate profits were ``discounted,'' or foreshadowed in stock
prices, during the great bull market of 1982-87.
   In early 1987, notes Standard & Poor's in its advisory
publication The Outlook, the S&P industrial stocks traded at prices
as much as 23 times their current earnings.
   Recently, the P-E ratio has been running at a much more
conservative 12 to 1, depressed by the crash last fall and more
recent worries about rising interest rates and inflation.
   Even if P-Es merely hold at their recent levels, a continued
rise in earnings would theoretically translate into high stock
prices.
   ``A 20 percent increase in 1988 earnings (of companies in the
Dow Jones industrial average) would be enough to support a Dow
industrial average of 2,800,'' argues John Dessauer in his advisory
letter Dessauer's Journal. ``And there is at least the possibility
that earnings gains this year will exceed 20 percent.''
   More pessimistic observers contend earnings don't carry much
weight in times of high or rising interest rates.
   ``Even as the threat of recession recedes and strong corporate
earnings are reported,'' say analysts at Wright Investors Service
in Bridgeport, Conn., they believe ``stock-price earnings multiples
will be trending lower over the course of 1988.''

   Karl Malden says ``My Father, My Son'' is the
story of a close-knit family rather than a story of Vietnam and the
tragedy of Agent Orange.
   Malden plays Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., who ordered the use of
the chemical defoliant Agent Orange to cler the jungle away from
Vietnam's rivers to protect Navy patrol boats. Keith Carradine
plays his son, Elmo R. Zumwalt III, a former patrol boat skipper,
who believes his cancer was caused by the defoliant.
   ``I think what you're going to see is a terrific family love
story,'' said Malden. ``I've never seen a family so tight.''
   The two-hour film is based on the book the Zumwalts wrote about
their experiences. The movie, which CBS will televise Sunday, May
22, was shot in Georgia.
   ``It's a fascinating story,'' said Malden. ``When the admiral
was assigned to Vietnam, his son wanted to go, too. And when the
admiral gets there he realizes the Viet Cong are knocking off the
boat crews left and right because the jungle goes right down to the
river. It was giving them protection.
   ``The admiral heard they were using Agent Orange in Missouri and
Kansas to kill weeds on some farms. He looked into it and then
ordered its use. The irony is that his son was captain of one of
those little river boats, and his son was the only one on his boat
to get sick.''
   Elmo III was afflicted with two kinds of cancer, lymphoma and
Hodgkin's Disease, which both Zumwalts believe was caused by Agent
Orange. He has undergone chemotherapy, radiation and bone marrow
transplants.
   ``The admiral did some investigating later and found the
government had led him astray about Agent Orange,'' said Malden.
``The government knew there was a higher rate of cancer in those
areas where it was used as a defoliant and withheld the
information.''
   In addition, the younger Zumwalt has a son with a learning
disability.
   ``Elmo and his wife came with their two children when we were
shooting the boat scenes,'' said Malden. ``They built a little
village in the swamp. The boy was so excited. I was in uniform and
wearing the admiral's name badge. Elmo told his son, who's about 10
or 12, `This is grandpa.'
   ``All that day I was grandpa to the boy and he kept kissing me.
On the boat going back he sat next to me. His affection was so
touching. I had to look the other way. I think the admiral feels
he's the cause of Elmo's and the boy's problem. I think he feels
guilty.''
   This was not Malden's first military role. He played Gen. Omar
Bradley in ``Patton.'' He was in ``Winged Victory,'' the Army Air
Corps stage show in World War II that was also filmed as a movie.
   ``After the war, I was in every kind of war movie,'' he said.
``I was a private, a corporal and I was the good sergeant to
Richard Widmark's tough sergeant in `Take the High Ground.'''
   Malden, who had made his movie debut before the war, won an
Oscar as best supporting actor for ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
Three years later, he teamed up with Marlon Brando again for ``On
the Waterfront.''
   Most recently, he co-starred in the Barbra Streisand movie
``Nuts.''
   Malden, well-known to television audiences for his 15 years as
spokesman for American Express travelers checks, played Lt. Mike
Stone in the TV series ``Streets of San Francisco.'' His co-star,
Michael Douglas, just won an Academy Award as best actor for ``Wall
Street.'' Malden's only other series was ``Skag,'' in which he
played a steel mill worker. That was a role he played in real life
in his hometown of Gary, Ind., before he became an actor.
   ``My father was an amateur actor in Europe and after he came to
this country he organized 30 church choirs,'' he said. ``He was
president for six years of the Serbian Singing Society of the U.S.
and Canada. He was a milkman and did that when he had time off.
   ``I decided to become an actor because I wasn't getting anywhere
in the mills. I had friends at the Art Institute in Chicago and
decided to go there. When I told my father he said, `Are you crazy?
You want to give up a good job in the middle of the Depression?'
Thank God for my mother. She said to give it a try.''

<HEAD>Mineral Mining Limited To Brazilian Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a victory for Brazil's left,
lawmakers re-writing Brazil's authoritarian constitution have voted
overwhelmingly to limit mineral mining to domestic companies.
   The Thursday night vote came on the heels of a Wednesday vote to
give special protections to certain domestically-owned enterprises,
a move that foreign businessmen indicated may discourage the influx
of foreign capital to Brazil's beleaguered economy.
   Legislators doubling as a constituent assembly sang the national
anthem Thursday night after voting to prohibit foreign companies
from mining for minerals or drilling for hydraulic energy.
   The constitutional article would give foreign companies such as
subsidiaries of British Petroleum, bauxite mining companies such as
Alcan and Alcoa and South Africa's Anglo-American Company a
five-year grace period to adapt to the new legislation.
   Foreign-owned companies control 20 percent of mining rights or
requests for mining rights in Brazil. Private domestic companies
own 52 percent and state-run companies own 18 percent.
   Also on Thursday, legislators voted 303-156 to maintain present
legislation allowing foreign participation in petroleum
distribution.
   A radical proposal that was rejected would have barred Royal
Dutch Shell, Atlantic Richfield, Texaco and Exxon from selling
gasoline in Brazil. Foreign companies now hold 55 percent of the
market here.
   The Thursday votes followed Wednesday's equally radical
decisions making it harder and less inviting for foreign companies
to operate in Brazil. In a bipartisan agreement, law-makers voted
to define what constitutes a ``Brazilian company'' and a
``domestic-capital Brazilian company.''
   The key distinction is that domestic-capital companies will
enjoy as yet-undetermined ``protection and special benefits'' and
will be allowed to develop the also yet-undetermined ``strategic or
essential'' areas of the economy.
   Legislators decided that a domestic-capital company must have a
majority of its voting capital and its decision-making power
belonging permanently to residents of this country. A Brazilian
company would be simply any company established under Brazilian law.
   The congress is expected to finish Brazil's eighth constitution
late this year.
   Rep. Sandra Cavalcanti, of the conservative Liberal Front Party,
said the new laws prevent multinationals from being considered
national, that is Brazilian, concerns.
   ``It's not fair that, say, a General Motors has the right and
the access to Brazilian savings,'' she said. ``This way, they can
come in but with their own investments and own foreign savings.''
   But the new statutes were widely considered nationalistic, and
the initial reaction of foreign businessmen was negative.
   ``The red flag is up for foreign capital,'' said Christopher
Lund, president of the Sao Paulo American Chamber of Commerce in a
telephone interview. ``It is unfortunate because they made it more
difficult to do business in Brazil.''
   Lund, a businessman who has lived in Brazil since 1962, said the
law will be harmful to the Brazilian economy by limiting the vital
influx of foreign capital.
   Brazil is strapped with a huge foreign debt of $121 billion,
inflation of over 16 percent monthly and one of the world's most
unequal distributions of wealth. About two-thirds of the nation's
143 million people earn less than $40 a week.
   ``Brazilians have the right to change their own laws, but if
their true objective is to change the life of millions of
Brazilians, you first have to have an economy that will generate
wealth,'' said Lund. ``You can't do that by limiting foreign
capital.''
   Wolfgang Sauer, a West German-born naturalized Brazilian who is
president of Autolatina, the local holding group for Ford and
Volkswagen, said ``discrimination will not resolve the economic
problems of this country.''

   The dollar turned in a mixed performance in Europe
early today as traders awaited release of economic data from the
United States and Britain.
   Gold prices dipped below $450 a troy ounce.
   The dollar drifted within a narrow range in the first hours of
European trading.
   Late month commercial dealings kept the market moderately
active, but many players were staying to the sidelines prior to the
release later today of the U.S. index of leading economic
indicators for March.
   In London, the pound was quoted at 1.8765 dollars, up slightly
from 1.8755 dollars late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning, compared with late
Thursday, were: 1.6675 West German marks, down from 1.6705; 1.3865
Swiss francs, up from 1.3832; 5.6680 French francs, down from
5.6685; 1.8700 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8715; 1,241.20 Italian
lire, up from 1,240.50; 1.2295 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2297
   Japanese markets were closed for Emperor Hirohito's birthday.
The dollar was quoted 124.65 yen in London, fractionally down from
124.82 yen at the close of business in Tokyo on Thursday.
   London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price of
$449.75 dollars a troy ounce at midmorning, down from $451 late
Thursday.
   A trader said buying interest began to wane in New York on
Thursday as hopes faded that an oil-price stabilization pact would
emerge from the meeting in Vienna of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $449.70, down from $452.
   Earlier, closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $451.17, down from
$453.54.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid of $6.47 a troy
ounce, down from $6.50.

   Share prices moved higher Friday when Britain's
unexpectedly good trade figures for March briefly energized the
market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Excahnge 100-share index was up 1
point, or 0.06 percent at 1,805.4, at about noon (1100 GMT).
   The market jumped about 5 points immediately after the release
of the trade data.
   Volume was a modest 273.3 million shares, with investors
disinclined to take major positions ahead of a three-day holiday
weekend in Britain. Monday is a bank holiday.
   By the same time Thursday, volume was 276.8 million shares.
   Although the market moved upward following the government's
release of its trade report, share prices fell back when little
follow-through buying appeared.
   ``The figures were good but we didn't see any substantive buying
because it's in front of a long weekend,'' said Jim Young, a trader
at Alexanders Laing and Cruickshank Ltd.
   Britain's merchandise trade balance narrowed unexpectedly
sharply in March to a seasonally adjusted 854 million pounds, or
$1.61 billion, from 1.32 billion pounds, or $2.48 billion, in
February, the government said.
   Private economists had predicted a merchandise trade deficit of
1.1 billion pounds, or $2.07 billion.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. announced it was recalling
nearly 26,000 1988-model cars to fix possible problems with a
transmission cable that could cause false readings in the gear
shift indicator.
   Included in the recall were about 17,500 Buick Regals and about
8,400 Pontiac Grand Prix models, GM said Thursday in a written
statement.
   Both models have potential problems with the transmission cable
that could cause the cars to be in a gear other than that displayed
on the shift indicator, GM said.
   Some Regals also may have a faulty stoplamp switch, which could
make the brake lights inoperative when the brake pedal is
depressed, GM said.
   In addition, the secondary hood latch of some of the cars may
not engage properly, presenting the danger of the hood opening
unexpectedly if the primary latch were to malfunction.
   GM said it was unaware of any accidents or injuries due to the
potential problems. Owners were being notified to take the cars to
dealers, who will make repairs at no cost.

<HEAD>No Progress in Beef-Orange Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese officials have reported no
progress after a third day of meetings to break a deadlock over
lowering Japanese trade barriers against American beef and oranges.
   They agreed to meet again today, but no one on the U.S.
delegation was optimistic about the outcome, said Gary Holmes,
spokesman for the chief American negotiator, Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter.
   The differences between the two sides ``have not been
narrowed,'' said Hidero Maki, spokesman and economic affairs chief
for Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato, Japan's negotiator. The
negotiations are going to take longer than anticipated, Maki told
reporters Thursday.
   Adding to the gloom, U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker told
a gathering of Washington visitors, ``chances are not as bright as
I'd like to see,'' that Japan will further open its market to beef
and oranges.
   Baker repeated warnings that the U.S. government will try to
have the Japanese import quotas declared illegal under the rules of
GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The United States had been requesting that Japan end the quotas
that the two countries agreed to in a four-year pact that expired
at the end of March with the collapse of an earlier round of
Sato-Yeutter negotiations.
   U.S. officials said ending the quotas was still the demand. They
declined to comment on Japanese reports that a compromise was under
discussion.
   The talks have been centering on ``the timing of
liberalization'' of imports into Japan, said Japanese Embassy
spokesman Toshiyuki Takano.
   According to Maki, four specific topics are covered in the
negotiations.
   They are: improvement of access to the Japanese market; future
role of Japan's Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation, the
semigovernment body that now handles 80 percent of beef imports;
interim measures pending liberalization and measures to follow
lifting of the quotas, he said.

<HEAD>North Carolina's Duke Power Agrees to Run California Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Duke Power Co. has tentatively agreed to
operate the troubled Rancho Seco nuclear plant in California,
company officials said.
   The deal is dependent on approval by Sacramento voters to
restart the troubled facility, idled since an emergency shutdown in
December 1985, said Bill Lee, Duke's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   ``If the Sacramento voters approve, we are confident that we can
operate Rancho Seco in a safe and efficient manner,'' Lee said in
announcing the agreement Thursday at the company's annual meeting
in Charlotte.
   ``Competition is increasing and the shackles of regulation seem
to be loosening in some quarters,'' Lee told shareholders. ``There
is risk, but also great opportunity.''
   Three of Duke's seven nuclear units have the same Babcock &
Wilcox Co. reactor design as the Rancho Seco plant.
   Details of the agreement in principle with the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District were not disclosed.
   Lee said operating Rancho Seco, about 25 miles south of
Sacramento, would enable the Charlotte-based utility to diversify
and market its engineering and technical services _ and thus
increase diversified earnings.
   A negotiating team headed by Doug Booth, Duke's president and
chief operating officer, met for several hours Wednesday in
Charlotte with Richard Byrne, SMUD's genera manager, and other SMUD
officials to discuss an operating arrangement, Duke officials said.
   The plant currently is the object of two competing local
initiatives on June 7 in California and one, offered by SMUD and
supported by Duke, would authorize an 18-month test operating
period. The other would close the plant permanently.
   Ed Smeloff, one of SMUD's five directors, attended Duke's annual
meeting and accused Duke of interfering with SMUD's internal
affairs and ``meddling'' with the ballot measure.
   Smeloff criticized Duke for contributing $100,000 to the
campaign to keep the plant running and pleaded with shareholders:
``Please let us make that decision ourselves.''
   In a subsequent interview, Smeloff said, ``I don't have a
problem with Duke wanting to come out and run a plant efficiently.
I don't have a problem with Duke wanting to make some money in
Sacramento. My problem is the integrity of the Sacramento political
process.''
   Duke abandoned its interest in owning the plant after it failed
to find a California partner.
   But Lee, in an interview Thursday, said, ``We think we're doing
what's in our interests and the interests of those consumers.''
   ``The plant hasn't run well,'' he conceded. ``But they have
invested $1 billion in it. The incremental cost of running it, now
that they've already got that investment, is very little and lower
than any other source of electricity in California.''

   Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed
unexpectedly and sharply in March to a seasonally adjusted $1.61
billion from $$2.48 billion in February, the government said Friday.
   However, the deficit was much wider than the deficit a year ago,
which came to $703 million.
   Britain's total trade deficit also narrowed sharply. That
figure, which includes merchandise, services, overseas investment
earnings and transfer payments, showed a $478 million deficit in
March compared with a $1.35 billion deficit in February and a $556
million surplus in March 1987, the Department of Trade and Industry
said.
   Private economists had predicted a merchandise deficit of $1.1
billion and a total deficit of $1.02 billion for March.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade talks ended in deadlock Friday
between Taiwan and the United States, and officials of the island
toughened their stand on further liberalizing its import and export
policies.
   ``We had hoped to launch a bilateral trade liberalization action
plan,'' U.S. Trade Assistant Peter Allgeier, who heads the U.S.
delegation, said at the end of a four-day negotiation session.
   ``Unfortunately, we have fallen short of that ambitious goal,''
he said.
   The Taiwan delegation refused to reduce tariffs on 60
agricultural products, or to lift import bans on peanuts, poultry
and animal organs.
   Another U.S. request to renew a five-year bilateral agreement
next year that limits Taiwan's rice exports was also rejected.
   Taiwan called for scrapping a 1986 agreement that allows local
magazines to advertize American cigarettes, claiming it promotes
smoking and also causes hardship for local tobacco growers. U.S.
officials rejected the request.
   ``We would not consider reducing tariffs on agricultural
products because we did not protect our farmers more than your
country did,'' said Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien, who
heads the Taiwan delegation.
   Taiwan officials, however, promised to review later a U.S.
proposal for tariff cuts on about 110 industrial products to help
reduce Taiwan's massive trade surplus with the United States, which
totaled $16 billion last year.
   Hundreds of farmers protested in the capital Taipei earlier in
the week, exhorting the government to resist any U.S. demands. The
farmers claimed Taiwan's earlier tariff cuts on fruits and other
agricultural products have already hurt their livelihoods.
   Taiwan reduced tariffs on 3,500 foreign products in February,
including 480 agricultural items. Import duties dropped to an
average rate of 22.6 percent from 35 percent.
   In the latest talks, Taiwanese negotiators agreed to take
measures to curb what the Americans called the rampant infringement
of U.S. intellectual property rights, but differed with their U.S.
counterparts on major details.
   Taiwan officials agreed in principle that translations of U.S.
works require the permission of their authors, but opposed making
the agreement retroactive.
   ``The discussion of a bilateral copyright agreement was very
disappointing,'' Allgeier said. ``Taiwan's positions are
out-of-step with more positive trends elsewhere in the region.''
   He said U.S. companies lose ``tens of millions of U.S. dollars''
every year because of pirated U.S. works in Taiwan.
   Taiwan agreed in 1985 to extend protection to all original U.S.
copyrighted works published after 1975, but pirated books are still
available at many book stores. That agreement does not extend to
translations.
   Taiwan also agreed tentatively to give either patent or
copyright protection to U.S. semiconductor products.
   Taiwan, however, refused to allow American banks to set up
branches outside of Taipei or ease restrictions on their credit
services.
   ``We know the modernization of our financial businesses can help
with our economic development, but this has to be taken step by
step,'' Wang said.
   Officials said more negotiation sessions will be held in June
and August to settle these differences.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds USG's Poison Pill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that USG Corp. can use
a ``poison pill'' strategy in defending itself against Desert
Partners L.P.'s hostile $1.6 billion takeover bid.
   U.S. District Judge James F. Holderman refused Thursday to grant
a preliminary injunction sought by Desert Partners against the use
of the defensive tactic.
   USG's poison pill would make it prohibitively expensive for
Desert Partners to acquire an 85 percent stake in the company even
if shareholders tendered the 39 million shares the Texas-based
partnership is seeking.
   Under the plan, USG shareholders would have the right to buy a
new series of preferred stock if suitors, like Desert Partners,
acquire more than 20 percent of USG stock.
   Holderman said he based his decision on the corporate laws of
Delaware, where many major companies are incorporated.
   ``Once the board decides to maintain the company's independence,
Delaware law does not require a board of directors to put their
company on the auction block or assist a potential acquirer to
formulate an adequate takeover bid,'' Holderman said.
   USG Chairman Robert J. Day said he was pleased with the decision.
   Desert Partners, headed up by two Texas oilmen, says it has
lined up financing commitments totaling $1.9 billion, including a
$1.4 billion bank facility and $500 million in subordinated debt.
   Desert Partners has offered $42 a share in cash for up to 39
million USG shares. In addition, they would offer about $600
million in debt securities and warrants, or rights to buy stock,
also valued at $42 each, for the balance of the deal.
   Desert Partners now owns 9.9 percent of USG shares.

<HEAD>Texas Railroad Commissioner Says OPEC Shows Interest In Visiting
Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC's president is interested in either visiting
Texas or sending representatives to learn better ways of monitoring
the cartel's oil production, Texas Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance
says.
   In a telephone interview Thursday with The Houston Post from
Vienna, Austria, Hance said he met for about 90 minutes with
Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC president and oil minister of Nigeria.
   ``We discussed the monitoring procedures we use at the
commission to know what everyone is producing,'' Hance was quoted
as saying. ``He expressed interest in coming to Texas or at least
sending some of his staff to see how we do that.''
   The Texas Railroad Commission regulates oil production in the
state, which was devastated economically by a collapse in world oil
prices two years ago.
   Alleged quota cheating by some members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has been blamed for the current
global oil glut and the weak prices. Members of the cartel have
been meeting with non-member nations in Vienna to discuss ways to
stabilize prices.
   Hance did not participate in the meetings, but came to hold
private talks with participants. His presence received widespread
attention and incited speculation of a possible strategic
relationship between OPEC and Texas, which would be the cartel's
fourth-largest oil producer if it were a member.
   Non-OPEC producers attending the meeting have suggested both
OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers agree to 5 percent oil production
cuts in order to boost prices.
   ``They've never really asked about Texas making cuts,'' Hance
said. ``But I told them we could not, would not consider making
cuts because we consume more than we produce.''
   Earlier this week, Hance said he saw his mission as `opening a
dialogue'' with the cartel.
   ``We're not in love with OPEC, but we need to have input'' into
decisions by an organization that controls about 35 percent of the
world's oil supplies, he said.
   ``I look at what's happened to our Texas economy'' since oil
prices crashed in 1986, he said. ``No one else is going to be
speaking up for the state of Texas, and someone had to do
something.''

   Consumer-products giant Colgate-Palmolive Co. is
putting the Kendall Health Care unit up for sale as part of a

   Colgate-Palmolive's decision to sell Kendall, which had sales of

divisions of Kendall for approximately $200 million.
   The company said in a statement Thursday that the sale of
Kendall's remaining operations would ``provide Colgate with

   Prospective buyers or a sale price were not disclosed. But
industry analysts have said Kendall could bring in at least $1
billion.
   Kendall makes hospital supplies and home health-care products,
including medical bandages, intravenous solutions and respiratory
therapy devices.
   Based in New York, Colgate-Palmolive is one of the largest
consumer-product and personal care companies, with sales of $5.6
billion in 1987.
   Its home cleansing products include Fresh Start, Fab, Dynamo and
Ajax; personal-care products include Colgate and Ultra Brite
toothpastes, Irish Spring and Palmolive soaps and Curad bandages.
   Other operations include Princess House crystal and Hill's pet
products.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The main negative influence was the unusally large number of
notices posted Thursday at the exchange of intent to deliver wheat,

   Corning Glass Works, the nation's leading
maker of cookware, said Friday it has signed a definitive agreement
to purchase Revere Ware Inc., the second-largest manufacturer of
range-top cookware.
   Corning said the acquisition would be made in cash, but
spokesman Eugene Saunders would not comment on a report that the
price was $120 million.
   Revere Ware, a Clinton, Ill.-based maker of stainless steel and
copper cookware, is a subsidiary of the privately held Revere
Copper and Brass Inc., founded by Paul Revere in 1801.
   ``The sale was very good for our company,'' Revere Ware
President Peter Cameron said Friday from his Illinois office. ``The
two companies are very well alligned. There's little redundancy.''
   About a quarter of Corning's $2.1 billion in annual revenue
comes from consumer products made of glass or glass-ceramics sold
under the Pyrex Corning Ware Visions and Corelle trademarks,
Corning said.
   The acquisition, to be completed by the end of June, would add
more than 10 percent to Corning's consumer products sales. The
company's consumer products division reported sales of $547.9
million in 1987.
   Corning Chairman James R. Houghton said the acquisition ``offers
us a strong brand name and a business that complements our own,
affording us added value in the consumer marketplace.''
   He said the deal will not dilute earnings in the first 12 months
of operation and after that period, would be a contributor to
earnings.
   ``We know that Revere will substantially strengthen Corning's
position in department stores, and that Corning can significantly
broaden Revere's position in other markets,'' Houghton said.
   In addition to consumer housewares, Corning manufactures
automobile pollution control devices, fiber optics and specialty
glass and ceramics. It also operates a network of clinical testing
labs.
   Corning recently was outbid by pharmaceutical giant SmithKline
Beckman Corp. in an attempt to purchase International Clinical
Laboratories Inc. of Nashville, Tenn.

<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Dutch consortium has signed a
contract with the government here to explore for and produce oil in
Ecuador's eastern Amazon River basin, the government said.
   The agreement calls for a four-year exploration stage and a $58
million investment, the government said in a press release issued
after a signing ceremony presided over by President Leon Febres
Cordero on Thursday.
   The consortium is composed of Unocal Corp. and a subsidary of
Union Pacific Resources Co. of the United States and Ned Lloyd
Energy BV of Holland.
   More than a dozen foreign oil firms or consortiums have begun
working in Ecuador since Febres Cordero, a pro-business
conservative, took office four years ago and embarked on a policy
of attracting oil companies through risk investment contracts.
   Ecuador, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, currently produces 300,000 42-gallon barrels of oil a
day and exports about half of that.

<HEAD>Dull Days in the Marketplace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compared to other periods over the past two
decades, these are dull days in the marketplace.
   ``There are no new issues on the economic front,'' says a report
from Data Resources Inc., supplier of economic numbers and
projections to government and industry.
   About the only thing new, it says, is that the allegedy
overextended recovery is simply one month older. Next month, it
seems to suggest, the news is likely to be that the recovery is
older by still another month.
   Everyone is watching for a rise or fall of interest rates, but
the rates don't respond. Inflation seems to be safely tucked away,
for the moment at least. The dollar has stopped moving. The stock
market seems tired of it all.
   Congress and the White House aren't doing much to stir things,
since it is well known that any brief period of calm can be
destroyed by one ill-timed proposal or careless comment. Besides,
it's an election year.
   Even the trade bill, once thought of as landmark legislation,
isn't likely to make a very big difference in the economy. The
consumer seems neither very bullish nor bearish. Investors hang
around the sidelines. Quiet pervades.
   Every now and then there is an attempt to produce a little
action. A report hints at inflation, but the next one buries the
thought. Interest rates jiggle higher, but then fall back almost
all the way.
   Concern develops that the expansion is turning into boom or
bust, but the latest gross national product figures neutralize the
fears, showing that growth is in the non-inflationary,
non-recessionary range of 2.5 percent and steady.
   Such intervals have been rare in the past, and usually brief,
and always have preceded movements one way or the other. This
knowledge is a factor in the current quiet; it makes investors
observers, waiting for cues to develop.
   Consider the contrast with the 1970s, when prices, interest
rates and most other economic elements were out of whack. People
knew then that prices and interest rates would continue to soar, so
a wild enthusiasm was generated.
   Real estate hucksters appeared everywhere, selling desert land,
swamp land and land that wasn't even theirs to people who bought
from a brochure and then went looking for it later.
   Get-rich-quick seminars roamed the country, with financial
evangelists mesmerizing folks with tales of how they were down, out
and broke a few years ago, but how they, just ordinary folks like
you, learned to make a fortune.
   Believing them, ordinary folks went out and borrowed big amounts
of money and invested it, mainly in real estate, certain that they
could repay the bank with cheaper dollars while their assets soared
in value. For many, it was true.
   Tax shelters were the rage; you might recall your neighbor
bragging about how much in taxes he saved by getting into cattle
feeding, and you knew that it didn't turn out the way he said it
would when he never spoke about it again.
   It's very much different now. Nobody knows which way the economy
is going to head. The big dreams have been tucked away for another
day, and if there is any prevailing mood it is probably one of
bearishness.
   Battered by the Oct. 19 crash, last year's outspoken stock
market bulls morosely search for bearings. Small-investor
conventions, once foot-stomping revivals for folks who dreamed of
quick fortunes in coins, gold and odd stocks, are now like prayer
meetings.
   Everyone waits for the economy to make a move one way or
another, knowing that whenever it does there will be action again
and plenty of those ingenious, creative, old-fashioned and often
exploitive opportunities.

   Northwest Airlines said today it has reached
a tentative four-year contract agreement covering its 10,000
mechanics and ground service employees.
   The company also signed a contract today with the union
representing 6,700 flight attendants. The union announced earlier
today that its members had ratified the tentative agreement.
   The agreement with the International Association of Machinists
District Lodge 143 unifies three contracts covering former Republic
Airlines workers and Northwest workers. The two Minneapolis-based
airlines merged in 1986.
   Terry Erskine, the airline's vice president of law and labor
relations, said the agreement was reached Thursday night after two
weeks of negotiations.
   The agreement will bring former Republic workers to parity with
their Northwest counterparts by increasing wages an average of 20
percent for ramp-service employees and 13 percent for mechanics and
related personnel, Erskine said.
   Guy Cook, president and general chairman of IAM District Lodge
143, announced the tentative agreement from Atlanta at the same
time Erskine made the announcement at a news conference in Eagan.
   It was not immediately known whether the union was recommending
approval or rejection of the contract.
   Erskine said the ratification process will begin next week and
take a month or six weeks to complete.
   In addition to equalizing wages, the proposed agreement would
include an average pay increase of about 3.2 percent a year for all
employees covered by the contract.
   Erskine said the agreement also unifies work rules, pensions and
benefits, all modeled after the Northwest mechanics' contract.
   The proposed contract also includes a 5-year, new-hire pay scale
with entry level wages 17 percent lower than current rates for
unskilled and semi-skilled jobs.
   The tentative contract agreement with the flight attendants was
reached on March 22, ending a strike threatened for March 29.
   Suzanne Balzer, a spokeswoman for Teamsters Local 2747, said
this morning that 61 percent, or 2,854 attendants, approved the
contract, which 1,829 or 39 percent voted against.
   ``We're pleased that it was that strong a ``for'' vote
considering the group of people who were trying to run a ``no''
vote campaign,'' Ms. Balzer said.
   A simple majority of the attendants voting was needed to ratify;
6,646 were eligible to vote.
   The Teamsters bargaining committee passed the contract proposal
to union members without recommending approval or rejection. Union
officials had said they expected it to be ratified.
   The pact would take effect June 1 and expire Dec. 31, 1992, but
would not be retroactive to the contract starting date of Jan. 1,
1987.
   The pact merges two labor agreements to provide common wages,
fringe benefits and work rules for all flight attendants.
   Under one section of the proposal, flight attendants who worked
for the Minneapolis-based Republic Airlines before it merged with
Northwest in 1986 will receive pay raises averaging 18 percent,
effective June 1. This will raise them to the highest wage rates of
original Northwest attendants.

<HEAD>Thousands of Firms Fail To Get Full Approval Under New Securities
Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sweeping law to protect investors took effect
Friday in Britain, but the new rules are so cumbersome that
thousands of financial firms failed to get approval to stay in
business and needed temporary reprieves.
   Widely criticized by the British securities industry, the
government granted interim approval to about 7,000 firms until they
could complete the complex paperwork and reporting requirements
imposed by the law.
   About 30,000 other firms obtained approval prior to the deadline
Friday, dubbed ``A Day,'' short for Appointed Day, the first day
that key provisions of the Financial Services Act of 1986 were
enforced.
   ``People are working very hard to get as many people through the
hoop as quickly as possible,'' said Robin Dix, spokesman for the
Securities and Investments Board, which is responsible for
enforcing the new law.
   It was passed in response to the so-called ``Big Bang''
deregulation of October 1986, which liberalized Britain's stodgy
securities practices and was designed to make London the world's
leading financial center.
   While the liberalization boosted Britain's securities industry
into a $43 billion-a-year business, lawmakers and consumer groups
lobbied for the new law to guard against unethical practices that
victimize investors.
   Under the new law, the Securities and Investments Board oversees
five self-regulatory organizations responsible for policing the
financial markets and enforcing provisions that ensure firms have
enough capital to operate.
   Brokers and investment professionals operating without
authorization face criminal sanctions ranging from fines to
imprisonment.
   The new law also requires investment advisers to become more
knowledgeable about client finances, investment goals and
willingness to take risk.
   Many in the industry have complained that the new system is a
hodge-podge of regulations that are difficult to understand,
expensive to enforce and a threat to Britain's international
attractiveness as a securities market.
   Some say the enforcement cost will run into the hundreds of
millions of dollars and drive business elsewhere.
   ``We think that is a very real fear,'' said Robin Hutton,
director general of the British Merchant Banking and Securities
Houses Association. He also claimed the law would not be as
effective as many of its supporters believe.
   ``It is wrong to think that the new measures will prevent fraud
and do what the politicians want, which is to catch crooks more
quickly,'' Hutton said.
   But some consumer advocates claim the regulations don't go far
enough and fear the cost will be passed to investors. Some have
complained because provisions for compensating customers who have
lost money through the collapse of firms won't go into effect for
months.
   ``What we're saying to investors is, `Don't be lulled into a
sense of security,' '' said Helena Wiesner, a research manager at
Britain's Consumers Association.
   Under Britain's financial deregulation, brokers were allowed to
make markets in stocks, an activity previously restricted to firms
called jobbers. The deregulation also abolished minimum commissions
and allowed banks to enter the securities business.
   But less than two months afterward, several embarrasing
securities scandals surfaced, inciting criticism that London's
financial district was not properly policed. The biggest scandal by
far has involved stock manipulation allegations surrounding brewery
giant Guinness PLC.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
Europe on Friday, reflecting a belief among traders that the
American economy is strengthening and U.S. interest rates are
rising. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the announcement that the March
U.S. index of leading indicators rose 0.8 percent, together with
other signs of upturn, gave a positive picture of the U.S. economy.
   They said the announcement that the Riggs National Bank of
Washington increased its prime lending rate to 8.75 percent from
8.5 percent further convinced the market that U.S. interest rates
are rising. Higher interest rates make the dollar more attractive
to foreigners.
   The day's dramatic moves appeared in British sterling trading,
following the announcement of better-than-expected British trade
data. Dealers said the Bank of England intervened to smooth the
pound's rise.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly in
March to a seasonally adjusted $1.61 billion from $2.48 billion in
February, the government said Friday.
   In late trading, the pound was quoted at $1.8785, slightly more
expensive for buyers than $1.8755 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe late Friday compared with late
Thursday included: 1.6725 West German marks, up from 1.6705; 1.3910
Swiss francs, up from 1.3832; 5.6805 French francs, up from 5.6685;
1.8745 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8715; 1,242.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,240.50; 1.2280 Canadian dollars, down from 1.22965.
   Japanese markets were closed for Emperor Hirohito's birthday.
The dollar was quoted at 124.80 yen in London, fractionally down
from 124.82 yen at the close of business Thursday in Tokyo.
   Gold prices in London late Friday were quoted at a price of
$449.25 a troy ounce, down from $451 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $449.00, down from $452.00.
   Earlier, gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid $451.17, down from
$453.54.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid $6.45, down from
$6.50.

   Japan called Friday for raising the
Asian Development Bank's capital but faced opposition from the
United States, in what appeared to be a struggle for influence over
the financial institution.
   In a speech to 1,500 bankers and finance officials from 47
countries, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita said his country wants
to recycle up to $30 billion in trade surplus funds. One way is by
increasing its stock in the 21-year-old development bank, Sumita
said.
   He said the bank, established to hasten economic development of
poor Asia-Pacific countries, has to expand technical assistance to
developing countries and increase loans not only to governments but
also to private businesses to reduce poverty in the region.
   ``If ADB is to respond to these issues and to achieve growth, it
is imperative that the bank's own financial base be strengthened,
for it is upon this foundation that all operations rest,'' he said.
``And I believe that a general capital increase is urgently
needed.''
   The bank currently has an authorized capital of $22.8 billion.
   Sumita told the annual meeting of the bank's board of governors
that Japan wants to increase its share in the bank's capital from
15 percent at present to at least 16.41 percent. ``And I hope the
governors will give this request their favorable consideration,''
he added.
   But M. Peter McPherson, deputy U.S. Treasury secretary, opposed
any capital increase, saying, ``Financially, the bank remains in
excellent shape.''
   ``At this time, my government does not foresee agreement on a
(general capital increase) before early 1990, and clearly our
position on these negotiations will be much influenced by our
perceptions of the bank's plans for using its resources,'' he said.
   Sources at the bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Japan is trying to expand its influence over the bank by increasing
its shareholdings and thus have the most votes at a time when the
United States is faced with budgetary difficulties and cutting back
on expenses.
   The bank, set up in 1966, is owned and controlled by the
governments of 18 developed states and 29 developing Asian and
Pacific countries. Policy is formulated by the board of governors,
which meets every year and is composed of the 47 member-countries'
finance ministers or central bank chiefs.
   The bank's annual report for 1987 shows that Japan had a slight
edge over the United States, controlling 15 percent of total shares
and 12.4 percent of total voting power, against 14.7 percent and
12.2 percent for the United States.

<HEAD>London Share Prices End Almost Unchanged</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange ended
almost unchanged Friday as a fickle market shrugged off some good
news about the nation's trade outlook.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at
1,802.2, off 2.2 points, or 0.1 percent.
   There was a slight, short-lived rally after the government
reported an unexpected sharp drop in Britain's merchandise trade
deficit in March, to a seasonally adjusted 854 million pounds, or
$1.61 billion, from 1.32 billion pounds, or $2.48 billion, in
February.
   Private economists had expected a deficit of 1.1 billion pounds,
or $2.07 billion.
   ``There was a reasonable bit of euphoria after the trade
figures, but the main institutions didn't buy with any
follow-through,'' said one equity salesman, adding that when Wall
Street opened lower, it added pressure to the London market.
   Around midafternoon, share prices continued their slump after
news that a U.S. regional bank, Riggs National Bank of Washington,
D.C., raised its prime lending rate to 8.75 percent from 8.5
percent, troubling market players about the outlook for U.S.
interest rates.

   Stock prices were broadly lower today, extending
Thursday's slow-motion decline in continued quiet trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.63 points on
Thursday, dropped 14.92 to 2,026.36 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outpaced gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall count
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 450 up, 979 down and
485 unchanged.
   Riggs National Bank of Washington raised its prime lending rate
from 8{ to 8} percent. Analysts said the move came as no real
surprise, given the recent rise of open-market money rates that
help determine banks' cost of funds.
   In fact, interest rates in the credit markets showed signs of
steadying today after rising on Thursday.
   Still, analysts said stocks were still suffering from a dearth
of buying interest among both individual investors and professional
money managers.
   The market showed little reaction to the Commerce Department's
report that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.8
percent in March. The figure came in close to advance estimates.
   Ford Motor dropped \ to 47] despite the company's report
Thursday of record first-quarter profits.

   Soybean futures prices rallied in the last hour
of trading to close sharply higher Friday on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Grain futures were mixed.
   No single factor sparked the runup in soybean futures but
revised weather forecasts, predicting less rain in the Corn Belt
than previous reports played a role, said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Government estimates for a low carryover of U.S. soybean stocks
into the next marketing year have put the market on edge,
Lespinasse said.
   ``The soybean market is extremely sensitive to weather because
if we don't have a good crop this year they're going to cut that
carryover down to the bone,'' he said.
   Overall support stemmed from persistently bullish underlying
fundamental and technical factors, he said.
   ``First and foremost, you've got to remember that we're in a
bull market and in a bull market, prices go up,'' Lespinasse said.
   Wheat futures closed mixed while corn futures finished slightly
higher.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.04{ a bushel; corn was } cent to

<HEAD>Australian Tycoon Sells His Empire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Robert Holmes a Court, whose
fortune dwindled from billions to millions in October's market
crash, sold most of his stake in his Bell Group Ltd. business
empire Friday.
   Two investor groups said they paid a total of 333 million
Australian dollars, or about $253 million, for a nearly 40 percent
interest in Bell Group, which has interests in a variety of
industries.
   The sale reduced Holmes a Court's stake in Bell Group, which
controls 43 percent of Bell Resources Ltd., to about 3 percent.
   The announcement ended days of speculation about the future of
the once-feared corporate raider and also tolled the end of an era
in Australian business.
   Holmes a Court, who at the peak of his success was one of
Australia's wealthiest men, earning an estimated $43 every second,
is reported to have become tired of corporate life, particularly in
the wake of the stock market crash.
   The companies he controlled lost about $380 million, the biggest
corporate loss in Australian history, due to investment writedowns
in the wake of the global market collapse.
   Under the deal announced Friday, the Western Australian State
Government Insurance Commission and Alan Bond, a brewing and media
magnate who won the America's Cup in 1983, each purchased 19.9
percent stakes in Bell Group.
   The commission said it paid the equivalent of $1.90 a share for
its stake, or about $122 million. Bond, who made his purchase
through Bond Corp., paid $2.05 a share, or about $131.5 million.
   Both parties said they regarded their holdings as investments
only and noted that they did not collaborate in purchasing Bell
shares.
   SGIC Chairman Wyvern Rees said the government authority would
not interfere with Bell Group's management.
   Holmes a Court is expected to remain chairman and chief
executive of Bell Group, said Peter Mitchell, Bond Corp.'s
executive director.
   Calling Holmes a Court's decision to sell most of his Bell Group
holdings ``undoubtedly difficult,'' Mitchell said Bond Corp. was
satisfied with its investment and had no plans to try to acquire
the rest of the company.
   Since the market crash Holmes a Court has been selling assets to
help ease his cash crunch. Bell Group and Bell Resources have sold
off assets valued at about $3.42 billion.
   In November, Holmes a Court sold Bell's 12.3 percent stake in
U.S. oil giant Texaco Inc. to takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn for
$795.5 million, taking an esimtated $96 million loss on the
transaction.
   Earlier that month he also sold a 2.5 percent stake in Broken
Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest company, to other
interests for nearly $200 million. He sold some of his properties
in Perth for about $140 million.
   Broken Hill, which has major interests in the United States,
South America and elsewhere, had been threatened in recent years by
Bell Resources, which amassed an 11 percent stake in the company
through several takeover bids. Mitchell said Bond Corp. approved of
Bell Group's asset sales so far but did not want the company to
divest its West Australian Newspapers Ltd.
   Bond Corp. owns one of Australia's three commerical national
television networks. Its stake in Bell Group could raise questions
as to whether Bond Corp. is in violation of the government's media
cross-ownership laws, which limit the size of investments in
television and newspaper concerns in the same city.
   Separately, Holmes a Court dropped his plan to merge Bell Group
with Bell Resources, giving way to a pair of corporate raiders
bidding for Bell Resources.
   Bell Resources, a mining and investment concern, is the subject
of a $684 million takeover bid by Sir Ronald Brierley's Industrial
Equity Ltd. and Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd.
   The merger proposal was seen by many analysts as a move to
simplify Holmes a Court's corporate structure after the October
stock market crash, to put togther Bell Resource's cash and
investments with Bell Group's industrial operations, and therefore
to reduce Bell Group's heavy borrowings.

<HEAD>Leading Index Posts Second Big Monthly Gain</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS New 8th graf, At the ..., with White House comment.
A
version moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge recorded its second big monthly gain in March, a 0.8 percent
increase that economists said should spell good news for Republican
presidential election chances.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that the March increase in
the Index of Leading Economic Indicators followed a revised 1.3
percent February advance, which was the biggest gain in 14 months.
   In other good economic news, the government said sales of new
homes, which had fallen for three consecutive months following the
October stock market crash, posted a 4 percent increase in March to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 655,000 units.
   Those reports followed word Tuesday that the overall economy, as
measured by the gross national product, expanded at a healthy 2.3
percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. It was a
far better performance than the recession many had expected in the
aftermath of the 508-point stock market plunge last October.
   ``The big worry at the beginning of the year was that a
recession would derail the Republicans, but the leading indicator
is just one more sign that this isn't going to occur,'' said David
Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., called the
string of upbeat reports ``terrific news on the future state of the
economy.''
   ``From the point of view of the administration, the news on the
economy could hardly be better,'' he said.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the advances in the leading index were ``significant and good news.
They suggest that the economy remains on a steady course and that a
healthy climate for prosperity will continue.''
   The unexpectedly strong growth has raised some fears that
inflation may become a problem, forcing the Federal Reserve Board
to hike interest rates in an effort to cool off demand.
   But analysts said that while they expect both inflation and
interest rates to pick up modestly in the next six months, they
don't expect either to increase so quickly that they will raise
voters' concerns.
   ``The strong economy will be more of an ally to Republicans than
a rise in inflation and interest rates will be an adversary,'' said
Donald Straszheim, chief economist of Merrill Lynch.
   Straszheim said he did not look for interest rates to increase
by more than one-half to one full percentage point between now and
Election Day, which he called too small of an increase to be
worrisome to voters.
   The February rise in the leading index hd initially been
reported as a smaller 0.9 percent gain. With the revision, it is
now the strongest monthly increase since a 2.2 percent rise in
December 1986.
   The February and March strength represented a significant
turnaround in the forecasting gauge, which is composed of 11
forward-pointing business barometers designed to predict economic
activity six to nine months into the future.
   Following the market collapse, the index posted three
consecutive monthly declines in October, November and December, the
traditional signal of an impending recession. However, with the
latest revisions, two of those declines have now been eliminated,
although a 1.2 percent drop in November and a 0.7 percent fall in
January remain.
   Lawrence Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, said the
initial declines exaggerated the economy's weakness, but he
cautioned against getting too optimistic based on the big February
and March advances in the index.
   ``The economy is still growing. We won't have a recession this
year, but we won't have a boom either,'' he said.
   The March increase in the index reflected widespread strength as
six of the nine available indicators showed gains.
   The biggest gain came from a rise in stock prices, followed by a
drop in weekly unemployment claims.
   The government said Thursday that weekly unemployment claims had
dipped to their lowest level in almost 15 years, fueling
speculation that the April unemployment report, due out next
Friday, will show the jobless rate declining to 5.5 percent. It
fell to a nine-year low of 5.6 percent in March.
   Other barometers showing strength last month were a slowdown in
delivery times for businesses, an indication of rising demand; an
increase in building permits; faster growth of the nation's money
supply; and an increase in raw materials prices, which the index
views as a positive sign that demand for these products is
increasing.
   Three indicators held the index back. The biggest negative
factor was a drop in the length of the average work week, followed
by declines in orders for plant and equipment and demand for
consumer goods.
   Analysts said the drop in the work week should be viewed as a
positive sign that employers are adding more workers to their
payrolls rather than trying to get by with a smaller workforce and
more overtime.
   The various changes left the index at 193.3 percent of its 1967
base of 100.

   The dollar finished higher against most major
currencies Friday, boosted slightly by fresh data indicating the
U.S. economy remains healthy.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National ~ank quoted bullion at
$450 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, unchanged from late Wednesday.
   Traders said the dollar firmed on a government report that the
Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.8 percent in March.
   The announcement that the Riggs National Bank of Washington
increased its prime lending rate to 8.75 percent from 8.5 percentZfurther
convinced the market that U.S. interest res are rising.
Higher interest rates make the dollar more attractive to foreigners.
   But despite the apparent {trength of the U.S. economy, investors
are shying away from aggressive dollar-buying because of|the
implications strong indicators have on the trade picture.
   ``A good U.S. economy is not good for the trade deficit''
because it means Americans are continuing to buy foreign goods,
said Stephen Flanagan, an assistant vice president at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   Much of the day's activity occurred in her currencies.
Investors bought the British pound following the announcement of
better-than-expectedpFritish trade data.
   The government announced that Britain's merchandise trade
deficit narrowed une~pectedly in March to a seqsonally adjusted
$1.61 billion from $2.48 billion in February.
   Dealers said the Bank of England intervened to smooth the
pound's rise. ``Sterling weakened a bit on profit-taking, which
encouraged the dollar to move up a bit higher,'' Flanagan said.
   Overall, however, the dollar traded in a narrow range. ``There
still is not enough reason to get out of the trading range,'' said
Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in
Chicago.
   ``There is   ...   to buy or sell dollars at
this point,'' he said.
   Japanese markets were closed for Emperor Hirohito's birthday.
Traders said activity was light, particularly because of the
absence of Japanese investors.
   In European dealings, the dollar rose against most major
currencies.
   In late trading, the ...  was quoted at $1.8785, slightly more
expensive for buyers than $1.8755 late Thursday. In New York it
cost $1.8755 to buy one pound, more expensive than Thursday's
$1.87385.
   In London the dollar was quoted at 124.80 Japanese yen,
fractionally down from 124.82 yen at the close of business Thursday
in Tokyo. In New York the dollar closed at 125.135 yen, up from
124.515 yen on Thursday.
  `her late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.6773 West German marks, up from 1.6694;
1.39775 Swiss francs, up from 1.38425; 5.6965 French francs, up
from 5.6710; 1,248.00 Italian lire, up from 1,242.375, and 1.22895
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2302.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday: 1.6725
West German marks, up from 1.6705; 1.3910 Swiss francs, up from

   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $451 a troy

<HEAD>Northwest Parent, Pan Am Post First-Quarter Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. and the parent of Northwest Airlines on Friday
reported losses for the first quarter which they blamed on higher
costs.
   New York-based Pan Am, the eighth-largest airline, said its
first quarter net loss narrowed to $83.3 million from $93.6 million
a year earlier.
   Revenue jumped 18 percent, to $900.8 million from $763.1 million
in the first three months of 1987.
   St. Paul-based NWA Inc., which operates Northwest, said it had a
first quarter net loss of $43.5 million, widened from a loss of $35
million in the first three months of 1987.
   The loss occurred despite an increase in first-quarter revenue,
to $1.24 billion from $1.17 billion a year earlier.
   Pan Am said an improved performance by its Northeast shuttle
service and Pan Am World Services helped narrow its loss from a
year earlier. The air shuttle links New York, Boston and
Washington, while Pan Am World Services provides ground services to
other carriers in airports around the world.
   The company's main subsidiary, Pan American World Airways,
posted an operating loss of $62 million in the first quarter,
widened from a $51.1 million loss a year earlier. The deterioration
was blamed on increases in the costs of fuel, advertising, aircraft
rentals and other expenses.
   The loss at Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, was
attributed to rising costs and a strike threat by flight
attendants. The company said its earnings also were affected by a
$10 million one-time writedown of accounts receivable from a travel
wholesaler.
   ``Higher fuel, payroll, travel agent commission and maintenance
costs combined with the threat of a flight attendant strike
contributed to the increased operating loss,'' said Steven G.
Rothmeier, NWA's chairman and chief executive officer.
   He said that compared with the first quarter of 1987, the price
of fuel for the airline jumped by 7.3 cents a gallon to 59.2 cents,
payroll expenses increased 7.4 percent to $407.8 million, and
commissions paid to agents were up 22.1 percent to $192 million.
   Maintenance salaries and material expenses rose as the airline
accelerated its overhaul of spare engines, NWA said.
   The company reached a tentative contract agreement with its
6,700 flight attendants on March 22, averting a strike set for
March 29. The Teamsters union local representing the attendants
announced earlier Friday that the contract had been ratified
through a mail-in vote.
   Pan Am also said it was informed Friday by its flight attendants
union that the attendants had voted to reject a new contract
calling for $90 million in wage cuts and other labor concessions.
The contract has been ratified by the unions representing pilots
and flight engineers at the airline, and negotiations are ongoing
between management and the Transport Workers Union.
   The company underwent a major management shakeup in January in
which the chairman and other top executives were replaced. To
ensure its financial recovery, Pan Am would need labor concessions
totaling around $540 million over three years, analysts and company
sources estimate.
   The concessions agreed to by the pilots and flight engineers
represent about $240 million over three years, while the Teamsters
union has informally accepted $35 million.

   Some late buying of smaller ``secondary'' issues
enabled the stock market to finish mixed Friday in another
slow-motion session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.95 to
2,032.33, closing out the week with a net gain of 17.24 points.
   Advancing issues and declines were evenly balanced in the daily
tally on the New York Stock Exchange, with 748 up, 738 down and 491
unchanged. Declines had earlier predominated by as much as a 5-2
ratio.
   Big Board volume came to 135.62 million shares, just a bit above
the 1988 low of 128.68 million recorded Thursday. The NYSE's
composite index lost .46 to 147.87.
   Riggs National Bank of Washington raised its prime lending rate
from 8{ to 8} percent. Analysts said the increase came as no real

   Japan's agriculture minister will remain in
Washington until next week in efforts to break the deadlock in
negotiations over barriers against the sale of more U.S. beef and
oranges in Japan, a spokesman said Friday.
   Takashi Sato, minister of agriculture, fisheries and forestry
and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter met for the third
consecutive day Friday and decided to continue their talks Monday,
said Sato's spokesman and economic director, Hidero Maki.
   Maki told reporters many points were covered and there were
differences between the two sides that were difficult to bridge,
especially in the case of beef. He would not say if there was any
progress.
   The United States has been demanding that Japan end the quotas
that the two countries agreed to in a four-year accord that expired
at the end of March with the collapse of an earlier round of
Sato-Yeutter talks.
   Japanese beef and citrus producers have argued that removal of
the quotas would threaten their livelihood. U.S. exporters counter
that Japanese consumers are being deprived of meat and fruit
costing less than half the prices charged for the protected
domestic products.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Soar On Weather Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasts for dry weather in the western Corn Belt sparked a
buying binge among soybean futures traders Friday, sending prices
soaring to new contract highs on the Chicago Board of Trade. Grain
futures were mixed.
   On other futures markets, livestock and meat were mixed, energy
futures were mostly lower; precious metals were mixed; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   Government estimates for a low carryover of U.S. soybean stocks
into the next marketing year have focused the market's attention on
the weather as soybean planting begins.
   Forecasts earlier in the week had predicted nearly ideal
planting conditions this weekend in the western Corn Belt followed
by rain early next week, which would get the newly planted seeds
off to a good start.
   But new forecasts issued Friday painted a different picture for
the coming week. The National Weather Service predicted warmer and
slightly drier weather than normal conditions for the region in
both its 30-day and 90-day forecasts.
   ``The soybean market is extremely sensitive to weather because
if we don't have a good crop this year they're going to cut that
carryover down to the bone,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat futures closed mixed while corn futures finished slightly
higher.
   Wheat settled 2 cents lower to { cent higher with the contract
for delivery in May at $3.04{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2{ cents
higher with May at $2.02\ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1} cents
lower with May at $1.59\ a bushel; soybeans were 11\ cents to 13}
cents higher with May at $6.89{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures settled steady to slightly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in light trading that reflected nervousness
about last week's government reports showing larger-than-expected
numbers of cattle being fattend for slaughter.
   ``Based on the cattle-on-feed report, we should see substantial
fed cattle marketings coming out,'' said Tom O'Hare, an analyst in
New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``If that happens
and the market can't handle it, we'll see prices break.''
   Pork futures were mixed to lower due to an increase in the
average daily slaughterhouse kills this week, he said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .30 cent higher with June at
70.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .22 cent higher
with May at 78.67 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .05
cent higher with June at 48.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .12 cent to .35 cent lower with May at 51.35 cents a pound.
   Crude oil futures fell sharply in early trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid pessimism about the ability of OPEC
members to agree on production cuts, but the market recovered and
settled nearly unchanged.
   Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries met Friday in Vienna, Austria, to discuss an
export-reduction proposal offered by six independent oil-producing
countries.
   Friday's expiration of the May heating oil contract spurred
light buying of heating oil futures late in the session, which
helped support crude oil, said Jim Ritterbusch of Carson Petroleum
Co., a Chicago-area oil distributor.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 1
cent higher with June at $17.99 a barrel; heating oil was .08 cent
lower to .82 cent higher with May at 51.79 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .16 cent lower with May at 51.67 cents a
barrel.
   The lower oil prices weighed on precious metals futures at New
York's Commodity Exchange, where gold finished nearly unchanged and
silver advanced slightly.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 40 cents higher with June at $452.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 3.2 cents higher with May at
$6.498 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2.4 points lower at 261.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda announced a voluntary recall Friday of
1988-model 626 and MX-6 cars, saying a throttle defect may prevent
the engine from slowing when the accelerator is released in cold
weather.
   The recall covers all 1988-model 626 and MX-6 cars sold in the
mainland United States, but excludes cars sold in Hawaii, said
Mazda spokesman Fred Aikins.
   Of the 72,883 cars in the throttle recall, 42,810 of the 626
models are also being recalled to replace defective automatic
shoulder belt mechanisms.
   There have been no reports of accidents or injuries caused by
either problem, the company said.
   Cars should be returned to a Mazda dealer.
   The throttle problem is caused by frost that may accumulate when
the car is driven at highway speeds in cold weather. The
accelerator pedal becomes hard to press, and when the driver takes
his or her foot off the pedal, the engine continues to run at the
same speed, Aikins said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were pushed and pulled by
speculation over interest rates and rumors of a stock-bond swap
Friday before ending the session narrowly lower.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 3-16 point, or about $1.87 per
$1,000 in face value, while its yield was unchanged at 9.10 percent.
   Riggs National Bank of Washington raised its prime lending rate
from 8.5 to 8.75 percent. Analysts said the increase came as no
real surprise, given the recent rise of open-market money rates
that help determine banks' cost of funds, and no large money-center
banks moved to match it.
   But the move was enough to jostle the bond market, which began
to speculate that the Federal Reserve Board would tighten credit,
thereby sending interest rates higher. When interest rates rise,
bonds lose value.
   However, the credit markets didn't stay down for long.
   ``There was speculation that money has been moving out of
equities and into bonds,'' said Sun Wong Sohn, chief economist with
the Minneapolis bank holding company Norwest Corp.
   Bond prices rallied sharply, but then settled back as the rumors
died. Analysts said there was little conviction in the market.
   ``The bond market is likely to mark time until more economic
statistics come out,'' said Marshall B. Front, an economist at the
Chicago investment and mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe &
Farnham.
   Traders were looking in particular toward the Labor Department's
report on April unemployment, due out on Friday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments ranged 1-32 point higher to 1-32 point lower,
intermediate maturities were unchanged to 3-32 point lower and
20-year issues were off 1-16 point, according to the financial
information service Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.13 to 110.23. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 0.36
to 1,151.80.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 0.21 to 278.14.
   Tax-exempt municipal bonds were down 1-16 point.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 5.99
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 1 basis point to 6.35 percent and one-year
bills were up 2 basis pointsto 6.67 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, fell to 7 percent from 7 1-16 percent late Thursday.

   Nervousness about the outcome of talks between
OPEC and non-OPEC producers has sent oil futures prices lower for a
second straight day.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, contracts for June
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell
29 cents to close at $17.98 a barrel. The contract lost 33 cents on
Wednesday.
   Among May contracts for refined products, wholesale unleaded
gasoline fell 0.53 cent to 51.83 cents a gallon, and wholesale
heating oil fell 0.80 cent a gallon to 50.97 cents.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to take strong positions
before the completion of OPEC meetings going on in Vienna, Austria.
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
were faced with a Wednesday offer by six non-cartel producers to
cut their output by 5 percent for two months, if OPEC did likewise.
   The move would be intended to reduce world supplies and bolster
prices.
   Talks among the cartel members over the proposal adjourned with
no decisions and were to resume late today.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said traders remained skeptical ``about whether these
meetings will accomplish anything,''
   Accordingly, Thursday's market was dominated by ``a lot of
profit-taking by traders who believed the market had come up too
quickly'' in recent week, he said.

   Italy's second largest bank remains committed to
acquiring a large stake in Irving Bank Corp. but acknowledges its
chances have dimmed given strong shareholder reception of the rival
hostile tender offer by Bank of New York.
   Bank of New York disclosed Thursday that nearly half of Irving's
outstanding shares had been tendered so far under its $1.08 billion
buyout offer of roughly $64 a share in cash and stock.
   Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, which is offering to acquire a
45 percent stake in Irving for $75 a share, has no immediate plans
to raise its offer but still believes it is the better deal, Lino
Benassi, BCA deputy general manager, said Thursday.
   Irving stock fell $2 to $60.62{ a share Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   ``We believe that our (current) offer is the best offer because
we provide a lot of cash ...,'' Benassi said in an interview.
   He also conceded, ``I don't think our chances are extremely
good'' of winning Irving shareholder approval of BCA's proposal.
   The Italian bank's stock purchase is part of a complex
restructuring proposed by Irving. Banca Commerciale also would have
the right to buy an additional 10 percent of Irving stock on the
open market after the deal was consummated.
   Bank of New York, which holds a 5 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of
Irving's 18.5 million shares outstanding. The tender offer, which
has been extended three times, was set to expire today.
   Bank of New York said that at the close of business Wednesday,
9.03 million of Irving's outstanding shares had been tendered.
Those, along with the 888,634 shares Bank of New York already owns,
give it 53.96 percent of Irving's shares, the company said.
   ``We feel we're right on track, but we don't want to become
overconfident. We're still engaged in a proxy fight,'' said
spokesman Owen Brady.
   The bank is running a slate of 16 nominees to Irving's board of
directors. The Irving shareholders' meeting is scheduled for May 6.
   Banking experts noted that the shareholders who had tendered
their stock to Bank of New York still could change their minds
should another, better proposal surface, but said another offer
appeared unlikely.
   ``I think they (Bank of New York) are definitely in a strong
position. They have the inside track, so to speak,'' said Michael
Starr, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc.
   Irving spokesman Hal Phillips said his company has no comment on
Bank of New York's latest announcement.
   Irving's proposed restructuring includes the sale of assets,
such as its 50-story Wall Street headquarters, cost-cutting
measures, and a $10-a- share special cash dividend. Banca
Commerciale values the entire Irving plan at around $69.50 a share.
   The Banca Commerciale proposal still needs regulatory approval
from both U.S. and Italian authorities. Some analysts say that
could work in Bank of New York's favor because it already has
received conditional approval from the Federal Reserve and New York
State Banking boards for its merger plan.
   Benassi said he was confident Banca Commerciale would receive
all the necessary approval, although he admitted it could take a
few months to achieve. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
recently noted in a four-page internal memorandum that it would
have to ``revisit'' the policy issues posed by the fact that 62
percent of the Italian bank is owned by the government agency
Instituto per la Recostruzione Industriale.
   There are no clear-cut policies for foreign government-owned
banks seeking to merge with domestic banks.
   The last time the Fed examined such issues was in 1982, when
Banca Commerciale acquried Long Island Trust Co. The Fed took 15
months to approve that application.

   Lucky Stores Inc.'s attempted escape from
an unwanted suitor through a $2.2 billion leveraged buyout by a New
York investment firm may not be the end of the takeover battle,
some analysts say.
   Lucky, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket chain, said
Thursday it had agreed tentatively to go private in a cash and
stock leveraged buyout led by Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd.
   Earlier Thursday, Lucky again spurned friendly merger proposals
by American Stores Inc., of Salt Lake City, which said it was
prepared to acquire Lucky for $60 a share. American launched the
bidding a month ago with a $45 a share tender offer that still is
outstanding, but Lucky rebuffed that offer and a later proposal by
American to pay $50 a share in a friendly merger.
   ``I think we could easily see the bidding war continue,'' said
Jeff Siegel of Pershing & Co. in New York
   American officials declined to return repeated telephone calls
on Thursday.
   Lucky shares jumped $5.37{ to $61.50 in heavy trading Thursday
on the New York Stock Exchange, as speculation of a bidding contest
heated up. American Stores rose $1.12{ to $61.50 a share.
   Under the agreement with Gibbons Green, the firm will launch a
$61 a share cash tender offer for 35.7 million Lucky common shares,
about 92 percent of its 38.6 million common shares outstanding.
   The remaining 2.9 million shares would be exchanged for
preferred stock with a stated value of $7 each, according to a
joint announcement by the two companies.
   So as a whole, Lucky shareholders would receive $56 a share in
cash plus $7 in stated value of preferred stock for each of their
Lucky shares. Assuming the preferred stock trades at slightly less
than its face value, as analysts believe is might, the entire
package could be worth about $2.18 billion in cash and stock.
   The buyout was conditioned on financing being obtained, a
majority of Lucky shares being tendered and other conditions.
Gibbons Green said it expected bank financing to be committed
shortly.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid with the company's cash flow or with
money raised by the sale of its assets.
   Gibbons Green said it would retain current Lucky management and
employees and maintain its corporate headquarters in Dublin, 25
miles east of San Francisco.
   ``We believe it (Lucky) is the pre-eminent supermarket company
in the areas of its operations,'' said Leonard Green, a partner in
the firm.
   Analyst Carol Palmer of Duff & Phelps in Chicago questioned
whether American Stores would renew its bid, although she said it
could afford a new offer of as high as $65 a share.
   But Jonathan Ziegler, of Sutro & Co. Inc. in San Francisco,
said: ``I don't know if we've heard the last from American Stores.''
   A merger of American Stores and Lucky would create the nation's
largest supermarket chain, surpassing Kroger Co.
   American Stores' initial offer for Lucky in late March came
about 1{ years after Lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt by
New York investor Asher Edelman by undergoing a major restructuring.
   American Stores, the third-largest U.S. operator of grocery and
drug stores, has about 1,620 outlets in 40 states.
   Lucky employs 39,000 people and has 480 outlets, including 340
stores in California.

<HEAD>A-Day Regulation Hits City of London</HEAD>

   Today is A-Day in the City of London _ the
appointed day that the core of a sweeping new system for regulating
the financial services industry takes effect, touching almost
everyone involved in the $43 billion business.
   The new regulations, imposed under the Financial Services Act of
1986, are aimed at better protecting investors.
   But industry critics call the new system a confusing hodge-podge
of vague regulations that could cost hundreds of millions of pounds
to implement, are hard to comply with and could drive business out
of Britain and into other financial centers.
   ``We think that is a very real fear,'' said Robin Hutton,
director general of the British Merchant Banking and Securities
Houses Association.
   Consumer advocates claim the regulations don't provide enough
protection for investors and that their costs will be passed on to
consumers.
   While the act's major protections take effect today, the
long-awaited rules are being introduced piecemeal and some have
been postponed.
   The system replaces a former combination of government
regulation, self-regulation, and in some areas _ such as the giving
of investment advice _ no regulation at all.
   ``It plugs quite a few gaps,'' said Barbara Conway, a
spokeswoman for the new regulatory system.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government,
criticized for its alleged laissez-faire attitude toward financial
fraud, has been trying to determine how best to protect investors
while overseeig the financial services industry, which it
deregulated under the so-called ``Big Bang'' in October 1986.
   The government has transferred responsibility for industry
regulation to the 17-member Securities and Investments Board, a new
non-government watchdog body with statutory powers.
   The board in turn has approved five self-regulatory
organizations covering different financial services sectors, which
will authorize firms and individuals to operate. These so-called
``SROs'' will police the approved firms, which will be required to
comply with tough capital-adequacy regulations.
   The rules require investment advisers to be more knowledgeable
about their clients' finances, investment goals and willingness to
take risks.
   Failure of firms and individuals to obtain SRO authorization
constitutes a criminal offense carrying a maximum sentence of two
years in prison and unlimited fine.
   Under the Big Bang deregulation _ most of which took place Oct.
27, 1986 _ brokers were allowed to make markets in stocks, an
activity previously restricted to firms called jobbers.
   Deregulation also abolished minimum commissions and allowed
banks to enter the securities business, among other things.
   But less than two months after Big Bang, stock market scandals
involving Guinness PLC and others broke, prompting criticism that
the City _ London's financial district _ was not being policed
properly.
   In the Guinness scandal, seven men including Guinness' former
chairman and chief executive officer were charged after Guinness
disclosed that its former management manipulated the company's
stock price to make a 1986 cash-and-stock offer for Distillers Co.
more attractive than a rival bid.
   Hutton, of the industry association, said ``It is wrong to think
that the new measures will prevent fraud and do what the
politicians want, which is to catch crooks more quickly.''
   There are other gaps. For example, the act doesn't cover Lloyds
of London, the self-regulating insurance market.
   Furthermore, provisions for compensating clients who have lost
money through the collapse of firms won't go into effect for months.
   ``What we're saying to investors is `Don't be lulled into a
sense of security,''' said Helena Wiesner, a research manager at
Britain's Consumers Association.
   More than 5,000 of the industry's players, or more than 10
percent, have not yet obtained SRO approval to operate. The
approval process was so cumbersome that SROs have granted interim
authorization to firms to meet today's deadline.
   Hutton said: ``If and when we get the financial services regime
up and running...we should have a very advanced system of
regulation in this country that will provide an increased measure
of protection for investors.
   How long could that take?
   ``Something like two years,'' he said.
