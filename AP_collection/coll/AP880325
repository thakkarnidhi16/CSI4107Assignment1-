   Vice President George Bush, far ahead of Sen. Bob
Dole in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, said
Friday he will stick to his game plan in the White House campaign
and declared, ``It's too early for me to start thinking about any
running mates.''
   With the latest Associated Press tally showing Bush with 788
delegates to Dole's 178, Dole was downbeat as he told the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce in Washington, ``I think it's probably a
foregone conclusion what's happening on the Republican side.''
   The Kansas senator, telling reporters, ``I can read the numbers
and I know probably what's going to happen,'' suggested he was
re-evaluating his campaign, but his spokesman said the candidate
isn't ready to abandon the race.
   Bush, after a speech at the University of Denver, said, ``I
don't see any reason to change any game plan that we have.'' The
vice president added: ``This doesn't say it's over. So I'm going to
just keep going right down to the wire and not speculate on
somebody else's campaign or on the Democratic side.''
   Asked whether he would consider Dole as a running mate, Bush
said, ``It's too early for me to start thinking about any running
mates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that I
don't want to do.''
   He commented after addressing an estimated 1,000 supporters who
went to a fieldhouse to see Bush and his family and have a lunch of
chili, crackers, brownies, iced tea and lemonade.
   Meanwhile in Washington, White House chief of staff Howard H.
Baker Jr. was asked on Cable News Network's ``Evans & Novak'' if he
would accept the vice presidency if Bush turned to him.
   ``It's not just going to happen. That isn't going to occur,''
Baker said. ``George Bush needs to find someone who will bring
strength to the ticket on a regional and political basis, and I
think that is not going to be me.''
   He mentioned former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, California
Gov. George Deukmejian, and New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean as good
choices for the vice presidential slot.
   Despite this, when pressed as to whether he would refuse the
position if it was offered, Baker said, ``I didn't say that. Nobody
says that who spent 20 years in politics.
   ``You know, most of my adult life I've spent in public service,
and if someone asked me to do it, I would have a very difficult
time trying to figure out what I was going to say,'' he said.
   ``But I do not wish that to happen. I do not think that will
happen, and I do not expect it.''
   Earlier in the day, Bush arrived at the Colorado Springs
Municipal Airport where he spoke briefly to about 300 people before
flying to Buckley Air National Guard Base in Aurora and going by
motorcade to Denver.
   Bush stopped in Colorado in a search for support in the state's
April 4 GOP caucuses.
   The Democratic and Republican presidential nominees will
represent the ``difference between night and day,'' Bush said at
the university. ``The country does not want to swing left to that
Democratic gloom-and-doom liberal philosophy, and we're not going
to do it,'' he said.
   Bush told reporters he is unsure whether the cease-fire
agreement in Nicaragua will work. ``I am skeptical,'' he said. ``I
hope it works. I hope peace can come and with it, democracy and
freedom. Those two have to be together.''
   ``You can't have a peace that ends up with the Soviets ending up
with a base in Central America. The American people are not as
supportive of our initiatives with the Contras as I'd like to think
the facts dictate. But they are strongly supportive of the concept,
overwhelming so, that the Soviets should not have another
stronghold in this hemisphere,'' he said.
   In Colorado Springs, Bush pledged strong support for the
Strategic Defense Initiative or ``Star Wars'' space defense
program, which is being developed in that city.
   ``Isn't it better to put weapons at risk rather than human lives
at risk?'' he asked. ``We can do it technologically.''
   Bush also brushed aside questions involving the Iran-Contra
affair and what impact it would have on his political future,
saying Americans are not concerned about that issue.
   ``The Democrats are short of real issues, bringing it up over
and over again. No one is even suggesting I have done anything
wrong,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Linkletter Preparing for Brisbane Expo</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top American representative at Brisbane's
Expo '88 will be one of the few Americans who can claim to be a
specialist in both world's fairs and in Australia.
   Art Linkletter is preparing to travel Down Under to play his new
role of commissioner general of the American pavilion, with the
rank of ambassador.
   ``I have a background of half a dozen years in world's fairs,
which is really very unusual, because it's not what you might call
a regular profession,'' the veteran radio and television
entertainer said at a news conference Thursday.
   A half century ago, he said, he left a comfortable job at a
California radio station to spend ``a very happy seven or eight
months'' organizing radio events at the San Diego-Pacific
International Exposition. That led to a similar job at the Texas
Centennial in Dallas and finally to more than two years at the San
Francisco World's Fair on the eve of World War II.
   Linkletter started acquiring his Australian expertise with a
``great fiasco,'' he said, participating in a rice-growing venture
in the bush near Darwin that became a kitchen for millions of
crop-devouring geese.
   But he stayed on to operate sheep and cattle stations that took
him to Australia annually for the past 30 years. ``I know Australia
quite well,'' he said, ``I am very, very fond of Australians and
the whole country.''
   The April 30-Oct. 30 Brisbane exposition will ``give a fresh
look to world's fairs'' with its theme of leisure and technology,
he said. This is especially appropriate, since Australians spend
the most of any country on sports, equipment ``and the fun of
sports,'' Linkletter said.
   The theme of the U.S. pavilion is sports and sports science.
   Linkletter, 75, said his own devotion to fitness and daily
exercise further qualifies him for the Brisbane post. He said he
skis six weeks a year, swims and plays tennis but has not yet taken
up golf because ``I'm not old enough.''
   In show business he directed or appeared in a series of
successful radio and tv programs including ``People are Funny,''
``Art Linkletter's House Party,'' and ``Kids Say the Darndest
Things.''
   He has written several books, including ``Linkletter Down
Under,'' about Australia, and the most recent, ``Old Age is Not for
Sissies.'''
   In addition to sports industry exhibits, and daily
demonstrations of gymnastics and smaller team sports at Brisbane,
``we are going to have such things as deaf basketball players and
wheelchair'' athletes in demonstrations of sports for the
handicapped plus continuous workshops in many areas of amateur and
professional sports and recreation, he said.
   Arrangements may be made for some U.S. stars of the Seoul
Olympics to appear at Brisbane on their way home from South Korea,
Linkletter said. Also there will be a modern health club, along
with marching bands and many U.S. groups ``who are raising their
own money and paying their way,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Real' Price Of Wheat Lowest Since Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department economist says
farmers could be forced to accept the squeeze between costs and
prices as a permanent way of life if wheat price trends are an
indicator of how the farm economy may develop in the future.
   Clark Edwards of the department's Economic Research Service says
farmers ``make more money when they become more efficient, they
expand, or their terms of trade improve.''
   Advances in technology have boosted yields of crops and
livestock. Farms have gotten larger because of people leaving the
land. But prices farmers get in relation to costs have tended
downward over the years.
   Thus, Edwards said, two of the three ingredients for
profitability have been working for farmers. But the third _ prices
_ has worked against them. That results in the ``cost-price
squeeze'' that has chewed on the farm economy for generations.
   Edwards, who is economics editor of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, examined the price history of a single commodity _ wheat
_ since 1800.
   Rising prices reflected growth in domestic and export demand
from the beginning of the 19th century through the Civil War, which
included inflated prices triggered by shortages during the 1861-65
war years.
   ``From then on, for more than a century, U.S. agriculture has
shown a capacity to grow faster than its markets, and the trend in
real wheat prices has been downward, with cycles from wars and
depressions,'' Edwards said.
   In economic parlance, the ``real'' price of a commodity includes
an adjustment for inflation. The ``nominal'' price does not include
an inflation adjustment.
   During World War I, wheat prices spiked higher, but still were
below the Civil War peak. In the 1920s, wheat prices declined as a
farm depression took hold. Further downward pressure came in the
Great Depression of the 1930s.
   Wheat prices rose again in World War II but were still below the
levels of World War I.
   ``The real price (of wheat) fell from its World War II high
throughout most of the 1950s and 1960s,'' Edwards said. ``There was
a gradual downtrend in the nominal price, and inflation picked up,
particularly since 1965.''
   But prices received by farmers in the '50s and '60s were
steadied by ``massive government programs'' which boosted the U.S.
domestic price of wheat above the world price, he said.
   As fears of global hunger and grain shortages developed in the
early 1970s, wheat prices were driven up to record levels and
heralded a return to wide annual fluctuations, Edwards said. Even
so, the real price of wheat at its 1973 peak was below the World
War II high point.
   Wheat prices dropped in 1986, reflecting changes in federal
supports authorized by the 1985 farm law, he said. That allowed
lower market prices to induce more export and domestic use, while
maintaining farm income through direct payments to growers.
   ``The price is edging up a little this year,'' Edwards said.
``Even so, the real price of wheat is well below what it was at the
depth of the depressed 1930s, and the lowest it has been since
Revolutionary times. At the same time, wheat yield per acre now is
about three times what it was in the 1930s, and the wheat acreage
per farm growing wheat is 10 times what it was.''
   Edwards acknowldged that wheat accounts for ``a small percentage
of total food outlays'' by American consumers and that the margin
between the farm value of wheat and the final food product has been
growing as a result of higher transportation, processing, packaging
and other costs.
   ``Therefore, a stable consumer price is consistent with a
decreasing wheat price,'' he said. ``Even so, wars, depressions and
food crises are reflected in the price of wheat, and the price of
wheat may be a useful proxy for long-run farm and food price
trends.''
   If that is the case, Edwards said those who think that farm
prices in the coming decades will rise relative to costs ``are
calling for a fundamental change in the long-run trend.''
   He added: ``It would appear more reasonable to expect farmers
(and help them when necessary) to continue to find ways to make a
living in the face of prospective long-run cost price squeeze, as
they have done for the last century.''

   Existing organizations and private funds could
help the federal government move ahead in rural development, says
Bob Bergland, executive vice president and general manager of the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
   A partnership between private and public interests is necessary
because rural communities must not be left behind as the U.S.
economy continues to change and grow, he told the Senate Budget
Committee on Thursday.
   ``Unfortunately, many of these communities have experienced
rapid declines during the last several years,'' Bergland said in
his statement.
   Loss of population, sluggish job growth, high unemployment or
underemployment, poverty and an education gap were cited as major
problems.
   Bergland, who was secretary of agriculture in the Carter
administration, said the association he represents is an example of
existing networks that can be used to help with rural development.
The NRECA, he said, provides service to 25 million people in 2,600
counties in 46 states.
   ``Today, the problems facing many rural communities have spurred
electric cooperatives to increase their initiatives and activities
in community and economic development,'' he said.
   Bergland recommended that the Rural Electrification
Administration in the Agriculture Department be authorized to make
financing available to REA borrowers for rural development of
business, industry and public works.
   REA is the federal government's chief lending agency for the
rural electric and telephone cooperatives.
   The financial assistance could take the form of guarantees,
loans, grants and the ability to create private revolving funds, he
said. REA borrowers then could be encouraged to put together
financial packages that would ``leverage federal funds with private
capital.''

<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special sweep of railroad traffic is
credited with rescuing illegal aliens from possible suffocation in
airtight boxcars, Border Patrol agents say.
   ``We feel that at least some of them would not have made it to
Houston,'' Silvestre Reyes, chief of the Border Patrol's McAllen
Sector, said Thursday.
   The 46 aliens, some of them dehydrated, had been crouched in a
four-foot-high space in the boxcar about seven hours when
discovered with the aid of dogs, Reyes said.
   ``Many of them were happy that they were finally out of that
place, and said they were concerned that they were going to die in
there,'' he said.
   Agents this week have been searching nearly every train car at a
stop about six miles north of Harlingen. By Thursday the crackdown
had netted 370 undocumented aliens and 120 pounds of marijuana, the
patrol said.
   ``We identified three particular (smuggling) organizations out
of this,'' Reyes said.
   In discovering the dehydrated group in the sealed car, along
with 16 more in two other cars, he said agents probably averted a
tragedy similar to the incident last summer in the West Texas town
of Sierra Blanca.
   Agents there found 18 aliens suffocated to death inside a sealed
boxcar.
   Although temperatures in the lower Rio Grande Valley have ranged
in the 50s this week, the temperature inside the boxcar with 46
people in it was around 90 degrees, and would have become hotter,
Reyes said.
   The group rescued Monday was dehydrated, but did not require
hospitalization, Reyes said.
   More than 100 aliens escaped during the train raids, agents
reported.

   Joe Garagiola lost his 1946 World
Series ring and other jewelry in a break-in at his home two days
after the baseball announcer pressed the Town Council to allow
security gates.
   Garagiola, 62, and his family were home at the time Wednesday
night but heard nothing, they said.
   The burglar got in by breaking a window in the closet of the
master bedroom and took $200,000 in jewelry from a chest in the
closet, said police Sgt. Ron Warner.
   The items stolen included the former St. Louis catcher's Series
ring from 1946, the year the Cardinals beat the Boston Red Sox,
Warner said.
   On Monday night, Garagiola pressed officials of this affluent
Phoenix suburb to amend rules against security gates at subdivision
entrances.
   Paradise Valley and two unincorporated luxury communities within
it have been hit by at least 15 similar burglaries since January,
police said.
   The Council agreed to study the proposal.

<HEAD>Dukakis Working To Lay To Rest Talk Of Brokered Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis, with a widening edge in the delegate race, is working to
lay to rest talk of a brokered Democratic National Convention.
   As the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination moves
into a springtime series of Northern and Midwestern state contests,
aides to the Massachusetts governor are laying plans to drive the
rest of the Democrats out of the race.
   ``It's conceivable we could have a nominating majority by the
day after California,'' which is among the states to vote on the
last day of the primary season June 8, says Tad Devine, a senior
campaign aide. More optimistic aides paint a scenario that would
effectively clinch the nomination earlier.
   Dukakis' rivals concede his superior organization, finances,
fresh endorsements and other advantages. ``There's no state that's
life and death for Dukakis,'' says Terry Michael, a spokesman for
Sen. Paul Simon, adding that most of the other contenders face
make-or-break elections in the next few weeks.
   But, they quickly add, Dukakis and his message of managerial
competence in the Massachusetts statehouse have yet to stir the
emotions of Democrats around the country, and a few bumps might be
all it takes to shatter his candidacy.
   ``I think his lack of a message of what a Dukakis administration
would do is catching up with him,'' says Mark Johnson, spokesman
for Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   ``They haven't captured the hearts of Democrats. All they've
been able to do is convince many that they're a safe bet,'' says
Simon aide Michael. ``They have been moving along picking up
delegates on tactics, not on message.''
   Dukakis' aides insist their candidate has a sound campaign
message.
   But they also argue tactics, saying that Vice President George
Bush's apparently secure Republican nomination is cooling the
enthusiasm for a brokered Democratic convention.
   ``The fear of giving George Bush a head start is eventually
going to help somebody, and if we do our job right, that person is
going to be Michael Dukakis,'' says Leslie Dach, communications
director.
   Dukakis' blueprint for the nomination calls for defeating
Gephardt in Saturday's Michigan caucuses and driving him from the
race. Next, aides seek a victory over Simon in Wisconsin on April
5, driving him from the race. They hope to follow up with victories
in New York or Pennsylvania that cripple Sen. Albert Gore Jr., even
if he remains a candidate.
   That would leave Jesse Jackson, but Dukakis' aides believe he
isn't likely to win more than 900 or so delegates, out of 2,082
needed to gain the nomination. They say Dukakis is prepared to
outline differences over policy issues with Jackson later in the
year, particularly over the Mideast and defense spending.
   During the period between New York's primary on April 19 and
Pennsylvania a week later, Dukakis' aides hope that many of the 645
``super delegates'' to the convention _ the party leaders, members
of members of Congress and governors _ will swing to their side.
   There is no disputing the strides Dukakis has made since he fell
to third place in Illinois:
   _ He has 533.55 delegates according to a count by The Associated
Press, an increase of 69 in the past week. Jesse Jackson, his
nearest pursuer, has 511.55, an increase of 51. But Gore, who has
360.8 overall, has added only six in that time, while Gephardt, at
154, has added only nine. Simon, the Illinois winner, has 171.5
delegates, 141 of them from Illinois.
   _ Dukakis has been endorsed since the Illinois primary by five
senators, 10 congressmen and a governor. The biggest prize, Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, has been mentioned prominently as a
possible compromise candidate in case of a deadlocked convention
this summer. Dukakis and the other contenders continue to vie for
support from New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   _ Recent national public opinion polls show Dukakis running
strongly against Bush. A nationwide survey conducted for ABC and
the Washington Post showed Dukakis leading the vice president 50
percent to 45 percent. Bush led Jackson, Gore and Gephardt in
similar matchups.
   _ He won the Kansas caucuses a few days after Illinois voted,
his first triumph in a predominantly agricultural state.
   However, Dukakis' rivals say his finish in Illinois _ where he
got 17 percent of the vote behind favorite sons Simon and Jesse
Jackson, and no delegates _ is symptomatic of a failure to attract
widepsread support to his candidacy.
   They say he has particularly failed to demonstrate appeal among
blue collar workers and conservative Democrats who will be
essential to Democratic chances of capturing the White House.
   Dukakis also stands accused of flip-flopping on a key issue,
belatedly embracing trade legislation to make himself more
appealing to the United Autoworkers Union members who will
participate in Saturday's Michigan caucuses.

   The armed forces that keep Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega in power went unpaid Friday and the broke and
beleaguered government ordered businesses closed in the general
strike to reopen.
   In a decree issued under a week-old state of emergency, the
civilian government that does Noriega's bidding said it would take
away the commercial licenses of any businesses ``offering goods and
services to the public'' if they remained closed.
   The decree specifically mentioned grocery stores, pharmacies,
transportation companies and gasoline stations.
   An estimated 90 percent of Panama's industry and businesses have
shut down in the strike that began Monday in an effort to force
Noriega's removal as the head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces
that includes the military and police.
   The government's inability to pay the Defense Forces kindled
hopes in the opposition that loyalty for him will wane.
   Several members of the Defense Forces, including a secretary at
military headquarters, said army, navy, police and air force
personnel did not receive their semi-monthly paychecks as scheduled
Friday.
   ``We did not receive our wages and we were not told when we
would receive them,'' said the secretary, who declined to give her
name. Soldiers questioned by reporters also said they had not been
paid.
   In mid-March, most of the 130,000 public employees were given
partial payment of at least $75 on their salaries. Those employees
whose monthly salaries are $1,000 or more were not paid. Social
security checks have been postponed.
   Demonstrators at the Roman Catholic cathedral protested the
church's failure to issue a denunciation of Noriega as expected.
   Pilots who guide ships through the Panama Canal and claimed they
had been harassed by soldiers in Panama City demanded protection
and met with the Panama Canal Commission. Some pilots had spoken of
a strike, but commission spokesman Frank Castrellon said the
situation was resolved at the meeting. He did not elaborate.
   John Maher, president of the Panama Canal Pilots Association,
said: ``There is no problem now.''
   Noriega remained obstinate.
   He was asked at a military ceremony about President Reagan's
renewed call for his departure and he replied:
   ``My president is called (Manuel) Solis Palma and my geographic
space is called Panama. I don't take orders from
extra-terrestrials.''
   Solis Palma was named chief executive by the legislature when
President Eric Arturo Delvalle was ousted on Feb. 26, the day after
he tried to fire Noriega.
   Two members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Reps. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y., and Peter H. Kostmayer, D-Pa., ended a two-day
visit Friday and told a news conference they thought the Reagan
administration should increase economic pressure on Noriega.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on narcotics
charges. The Reagan administration has cut the flow of money to
Panama, which uses the U.S. dollar as its currency.
   The order for businesses to reopen was in Decree No. 16 issued
under the state of emergency that enables the government to act as
it deems necessary ``to secure public order,'' including suspending
civil liberties.
   The decree also said any establishment that had been closed for
the past five days and sold food, meats or canned goods ``cannot
reopen unless it is first inspected by the Health Ministry.''
   It said store owners who do not comply face ``temporary
suspension of their licenses or, in case of repeated violations,
the cancellation of their commercial licenses.''
   The strike began Monday and was called by the National Civic
Crusade, a broad alliance of Noriega's opposition. Crusade leaders
said it would continue until Noriega was ousted.
   Panama Canal employees have worked throughout protests and
general strikes against Noriega that began last June. The canal
continues to operate normally while the nation around the waterway
is at a virtual standstill.
   Most of the canal's 230 pilots are American citizens.
   Soldiers man roadblocks around the capital and they demand
identification from drivers, search cars and rummage through
personal belongings. Some pilots complained about those actions.
   About 100 people stalked out of the cathedral after Archbishop
Marcos G. McGrath opened a special Mass by telling worshipers and
observers the church would not issue the anticipated anti-Noriega
statement.
   ``We don't know how this mistaken rumor originated,'' McGrath
said. ``We are sorry, but it is not our fault.''
   Civic Crusade leaders and Ackerman had said they had been
assured the church would issue a strong condemnation of Noriega.
   Those who walked out stood on the steps of the gray stone
cathedral chanting, ``Justice! Justice!'' and ``Noriega must go!''
   McGrath told those remaining inside that he and Noriega had a
``preparatory meeting'' Thursday. He did not explain and said he
could not discuss the conversation.

   Democrats and Republicans on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee are trying to settle the one major
dispute left before the panel approves the U.S.-Soviet treaty
eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles.
   ``I think we'll be able to agree on something,'' said Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., leader of a group of Republicans who are
seeking a compromise on the issue of how treaties are legally
intepreted.
   ``That is the only major question left and I would expect that
we can solve it by next week,'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
chairman of the committee, said Thursday.
   The panel spent three days this week rejecting a series of
challenges by conservative Republicans to the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty and has set Tuesday afternoon for a final
vote on the pact.
   Pell and other Democratic leaders have predicted overwhelming
approval, both in the committee next week and by the full Senate
next month when the Democratic-controlled chamber returns from an
Easter recess. Ratification requires the approval of 67 of the 100
senators.
   The remaining fight centers on the dispute between the
legislative and executive branches over the authority to interpret
treaties. The disagreement arises from President Reagan's assertion
that his administration can unilaterally change the intepretation
of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, a contention the Senate
disputes.
   Pell and other Democrats want some type of condition on the INF
treaty that would block a future administration from changing the
U.S. interpretation of the pact.
   Lugar said one compromise being considered is attaching an
amendment to the ratification resolution which says the INF treaty
cannot be reinterpreted by a future administration without prior
consent of the Senate.
   ``That is one ay to solve it and remove the fight from this
treaty without coming to a final answer on the intepretation
issue,'' said Lugar.
   The treaty was signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev. It requires the elimination within three years of all
missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. Anti-cheating
provisions _ the strictest in arms control history _ include
provisions for on-site inspections by each superpower in the other
country.
   In the Senate, the treaty has been criticized chiefly by
conservative Republicans, including Sens. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina and Larry Pressler of South Dakota.
   Senate officials are preparing for an unusual secret session of
the Senate early next week to examine sensitive intelligence
information about the number of SS-20 medium-range missiles
possessed by the Soviet Union.
   A total of 650 were declared by the Soviets and those will be
destroyed after the treaty takes effect. But Helms claims there are
conflicting estimates by U.S. intelligence agencies about the
number of missiles, including one report by the Defense
Intelligence Agency that the Soviets may have up to 300 more SS-20s
than they have declared.
   The Foreign Relations panel voted 15-2 Thursday to reject Helms'
amendment requiring new intelligence analyses of the SS-20
question. Only Helms and Pressler supported his proposal which
would have required Reagan to certify the accuracy of the Soviet
claims that they only have 650 SS-20s.
   The closed-door session will take place in the Capitol's Old
Senate Chamber, according to Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va.
   The small, historic room is normally maintained as a museum, but
Byrd said it is better for the meeting than the current Senate
chamber. The new Senate is laced with a variety of cables that make
it more difficult to protect security, Byrd explained.
   Later, the committee also rejected, 15-2, Pressler's plan to
block implementation of the treaty until Reagan certifies that NATO
won't be jeopardized by the Soviets' advantage in a variety of
non-nuclear weapons.
   Helms originally had 36 amendments, but dropped the majority of
them after only Pressler supported his proposals. Pressler also
dropped some of his challenges in the face of widespread rejection.

<HEAD>Industry Says Southwestern Thrifts Have Caused Heavy Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heaviest savings institution losses since
the Great Depression underscore the need for federal regulators to
begin cleaning up the mire of insolvent institutions in the
Southwest, savings and loan lobby groups say.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Thursday that the nation's
3,147 savings institutions lost $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter
of 1987, pushing red ink for the year to $6.8 billion, the worst
loss since the agency began keeping track in 1934.
   ``I hope it's the worst we'll ever see,'' said James W.
Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings
Insitutions, the industry's largest trade group.
   The bank board said S&L losses were heavily concentrated in
states like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, which are dependent on
the ailing oil and gas industry.
   The worst 20 institutions _ most of them in the Southwest _ lost
a total of $2.1 billion in the final quarter of last year,
accounting for two-thirds of the overall industry loss.
   ``The No. 1 item on the agenda is to stop the bleeding in the
Southwest,'' Christian said. ``That's in the bank board's lap. ...
And we hope they do it sooner rather than later.''
   Until recently, the bank board has been forced to keep insolvent
institutions open because it lacked the money to pay off depositors
or entice a healthier S&L into merging with the sick institution.
   The bank board said 345 S&Ls were insolvent at the end of the
year, 109 in Texas alone. An S&L is considered insolvent when its
loans and other assets are worth less than what it owes to
depositors and other creditors.
   By the tougher accounting standards the bank board will be using
next year, 510 would be considered insolvent.
   Yet, regulators closed only 17 institutions in 1987 and provided
assistance for the merger of 26 others.
   Now that money has begun flowing from a three-year, $10.8
billion recapitalization enacted in August, bank board Chairman M.
Danny Wall has pledged to pick up the pace.
   Last month, he announced a plan to spend $6 billion to $7
billion in Texas over the next several years, but the bank board
said Wednesday it expected no announcements on specific
institutions before early April.
   Martin A. Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of
Savings Institutions, warned that the bank board must move swiftly.
   ``On balance, next year will be not quite as bad, but that
depends on how quickly you get rid of these institutions'' in the
Southwest, he said.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said he believed
the industry's problems have ``plateaued out'' and that ``there is
some light at the end of the tunnel'' in the Southwest.
   Industry losses in 1987 were nearly 50 percent greater than the
previous post-Depression record of $4.6 billion, set in 1981, when
the prime lending rate soared above 20 percent.
   Insured S&Ls lost $1.8 billion in the third quarter of last year
and $1.9 billion in the spring. They earned $100 million in the
first three months of the year and had a modest $132 million profit
for all of 1986.
   In contrast, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said earlier
this month that the nation's 13,700 federally insured commercial
banks earned $3.7 billion in 1987. Still, it was their lowest
profit since 1933.
   Despite the overall loss for the S&L industry, 66 percent of the
S&Ls earned money in the fourth quarter. The $1.3 billion earnings
of 2,089 S&Ls partly offset the $4.5 billion losses of the
remaining 1,058 institutions.
   The percentage of institutions earning a profit has declined
steadily for two years, from 81 percent in the first quarter of
1986 to 66 percent at the end of last year.
   Barth said part of the overall industry loss in 1987 can be
attributed to a decrease in the corporate tax rate. He said some
S&Ls decided to push profits into 1988, when the top tax rate is 34
percent, rather than take them in 1987, when the rate was 40
percent.

   Israeli troops stormed a West Bank hospital and
a mosque and killed two Palestinian demonstrators and wounding 18
in a new outbreak of clashes in the occupied lands. Most media
coverage was barred.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir met with U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Pickering to express his ``dissatisfaction'' about today's
scheduled meeting in the United States between Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and two members of the PLO's legislative arm.
   Also Friday, an Arab-American advocate of non-violent resistance
to occupation called for the establishment of a ``parallel''
Palestinian government in Israel's occupied territories.
   The army closed key areas of the occupied Gaza Strip and West
Bank to the media, including the West Bank's Hebron area, where the
most of Friday's violent clashes occurred.
   In Washington, meanwhile, the State Department urged Americans
to stay away from the West Bank and Gaza. Easter and Passover are
approaching, Christian and Jewish holidays that usually attract
tourists to the Holy Land.
   About 50 Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets into
Hebron's Alia Hospital compound Friday to subdue about 100
protesters who were hurling stones and bottles, hospital officials
and Arab reports said.
   Later, soldiers stormed the hospital to arrest six Arab youths
who barricaded themselves on the roof, the army said.
   Reporters saw troops surround Hebron's Al Haras mosque after
Friday's Moslem prayers, firing live ammunition and tear gas from
the rooftops of nearby houses at several dozen stone-throwing Arab
youths on the mosque's roof.
   Four Palestinians were wounded, hospital officials and Israel
radio reported.
   After a two-hour confrontation, soldiers stormed the mosque,
yanked down Palestinian flags raised by the protesters and lined up
dozens of Arab teenagers against a wall. The army said 50 Arabs
were arrested.
   The army said it was forced to break in when the stone-throwers
refused to surrender. Television said it was the first time
soldiers had stormed a mosque since unrest began Dec. 8 in the
territories Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Another Arab was wounded in the village of Idna, Israel Radio
said.
   In the village of Tarqumia near Hebron, troops killed two
Palestinians and wounded 13, witnesses and the radio said. The army
said it was checking the reports but could not confirm them because
relatives took the bodies.
   Troops entered Tarqumia at about 4 a.m. and took over the
school, said Naim Odeh, a 52-year-old teacher. The army has
converted a number of schools into military bases since the unrest
began and is using about half a dozen as temporary detention
centers.
   ``Then about 500 youths marched out to the school and started
throwing rocks and broken bottles,'' Odeh said in an interview.
   Khaled Hassan Ahmed Murktan, 18, died of a gunshot wound to the
stomach and Walid Abdul Fatatta, 18, was shot in the heart,
villagers and Alia Hospital officials said.
   Friday's fatalities brought to 111 the number of Palestinians
killed by U.N. count in the anti-occupation unrest since Dec. 8.
One Israeli soldier has been killed.
   Meanwhile, 72 percent of the Israelis questioned said they want
harsher measures in the occupied territories. The Dahaf nstitute
poll published in the daily Yediot Ahronot said 7 percent of the
606 Israelis questioned this week supported less severe measures
while 21 percent did not want policy changes.
   Also, 49 percent of those questioned said Shultz' Middle East
peace plan _ essentially an exchange of land for piece with the
Arabs _ should be accepted. Forty-three percent were against it and
8 percent had no opinion.
   Israeli officials, however, reacted angrily to Shultz' plans to
discuss the peace initiative with two American citizens who belong
to the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   Shamir expressed his ``dissatisfaction'' during Friday's meeting
with Pickering, Israel TV said.
   Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner said Shultz's meeting with Edward
Said, a professor at Columbia University, and Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, a
Northwestern University professor, violates a U.S. commitment not
to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In another development, Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American advocate
of non-violent resistance to Israeli occupation, called for forming
a ``parallel'' government in the occupied territories.
   ``We should start thinking what kind of a Palestinian state we
are going to have, what to do with Jerusalem, where are the
borders,'' he told Israel TV.
   Israeli authorities confiscated Awad's U.S. passport and Israeli
identity card last year and ordered him expelled last November when
his tourist visa expired. Awad stayed following strong U.S.
pressure.

<HEAD>A Noriega Departure Could Mean Political Free-for-All</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
leaves, it could start a political free-for-all in Panama, where 20
years of military rule with a civilian facade have given opposition
parties little chance to mature.
   ``No dictatorship ever prepared a people for democracy,'' said
editor Winston Robles of La Prensa newspaper, which the
Noriega-controlled government shut down last month.
   Many political observers, including opposition party leaders,
predict a ``free-for-all, no holds barred'' if Noriega goes.
   The general, who heads the 15,000-strong Defense Forces, says he
isn't leaving. He has defied a huge opposition campaign and
crippling U.S. economic pressure and even indicated he might run
for president.
   The government-controlled news media have started referring to
Noriega as ``the undisputed leader of the political majorities'' of
Panama. His predecessor, Gen. Omar Torrijos, abolished political
parties in 1968 after taking power in a coup.
   In 1977, when he and then-President Jimmy Carter signed the
Canal Treaties, Torrijos founded his own party. He let other
parties campaign in 1984, but his Revolutionary Democratic Party
won in what the opposition called robbery.
   Most parties here revolve around a single personality _ like
87-year-old Arnulfo Arias Madrid of the Authentic Panamanian Party,
deposed three times as president by the military, and the leader of
the Christian Democratic Party, Ricardo Arias Calderon, who
returned Thursday from exile.
   Others parties are what Panamanians call ``stationery.'' They
exist on paper, issuing statements and communiques, but have no
popular following.
   Political parties have not been in the forefront of the campaign
against Noriega. The drive has been led by the National Civic
Crusade, a coalition of business, private organizations and
professional groups and some labor unions.
   ``We do not have any political leadership. We are being led by
businessmen,'' said a young man collecting food for residents of a
Panama City slum.
   While the Civic Crusade was organizing national strikes and
issuing calls for Noriega to resign, most politicians applauded
from the sidelines. Arias Calderon and some other Christian
Democratic officials have been an exception.
   Last month, the Civic Crusade and most of the opposition parties
formed an alliance and agreed that if Noriega goes, they will work
under a transitional government with deposed President Eric Arturo
Delvalle as its head. The next election is scheduled for May 1989.
   The Authenic Panamanian Party, however, refused to join the
alliance. Party leaders say they will never recognize Delvalle
because the party he represents robbed them of victory in the 1984
election.
   Arias Madrid is a populist first elected in 1940 and first
deposed late the following year. He was elected again in 1950 and
deposed in 1951. He was elected president a third time in 1968 and
deposed after 11 days in office.
   The Authentic Panamanians see Arias Calderon _ Arias Madrid's
vice presidential running mate in 1984 _ as a threat.
   The Christian Democrats, the nation's largest opposition party,
gave Arias Madrid the top spot on the 1984 coalition ticket because
Arias Calderon was seen as something of an egghead with little
popular appeal.
   But since then, Arias Calderon's close cooperation with the
Civic Crusade has positioned him for a presidential bid in a
post-Noriega Panama.
   When Arias Calderon returned Thursday, Aurelio Barria, the head
of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture and
a founder of the Civic Crusade, stood next to him as he greeted
cheering well wishers.
   Arias Calderon has also been busy building bridges with other
political parties, particularly the Liberal Republican Nationalist
Movement, in what is seen as an attempt to forge a new coalition.
   Some politicians say they do not expect the Crusade to survive
long after Noriega because its leaders are mostly business people
without political affiliation.
   Typical of the Crusade leaders are Ernesto Gonzalez de la
Lastra, general manager of an insurance company, and Barria.
Neither is affiliated with a political party.
   Other politicians, however, say the strong role people like
Barria and Gonzalez de la Lastra have assumed in the Crusade could
make them forces to be reckoned with if they remain active in
public life.

<HEAD>Pat Robertson Says He'll Do Some Muscle-Flexing At GOP Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson says his lagging campaign
for the Republican presidential nomination is being revived in
caucus states that will strengthen conservatives' hand at the party
convention in New Orleans.
   Beyond that goal, Robertson said Thursday night, he is looking
not only to lay the groundwork for another presidential campaign in
1992, but to help build GOP strength in state houses and Congress
for the 1990s.
   Although Robertson was beaten by George Bush in his home state's
non-binding primary on Super Tuesday, he told 700 supporters at
Falls Church High School that they can still capture most of the
state's delegates by turning out in force at local precinct
meetings.
   ``A few days from now we're going to be celebrating the most
important event in the entire Christian calendar,'' said the former
religious broadcaster, referring to Easter, which falls on April 3.
   He said the press wrote his candidacy off as dead after Super
Tuesday, ``but I don't think they're aware of the resurrection.''
   He said his campaign swept county convention delegates in Wake
County, N.C. on Tuesday, and had picked up other delegates in
Charleston, S.C., as well as Georgia, Washington, Nevada, Alaska,
Hawaii, Texas and elsewhere.
   ``All over this country, when June comes around and it's all
over ... our people should be in significant places of
responsibility in something like 15 or 20 of the state Republican
parties,'' he said.
   ``We are going to put together a coalition that will go to New
Orleans strong, speaking with one voice, and having enough
political weight to make sure that some of the things we hold very
dear ... are embodied in the platform of the Republican party,'' he
said.
   ``In the next few weeks, as these caucuses unfold in Virginia,
we are going to win the majority in the Republican Party,'' he
predicted.
   Asked as he left the rally if he was giving up in Colorado, a
caucus state where his campaign pulled the plug on a bank of 32
phones, Robertson said, ``We're going from paid phone banks to
volunteer phone banks. The operation is still under way. I'm going
out there for a series of meetings a week from Saturday.''
   In his speech, Robertson attacked the Civil Rights Restoration
Act that Congress passed Tuesday over President Reagan's veto, as
``a horrible bill. It was a federal power grab ... a blot on the
U.S. Congress.''
   Many of America's worst problems, including crime and drugs,
stem from erosion of morals, he said, adding, ``If we're going to
restore the greatness of America, we've got to go back to a sense
of personal, individual responsibility.''
   ``We must be No. 1 in our ethics, No. 1 in our morals, No. 1 in
our lifestyles, No. 1 in our adherence to freedom, No. 1 in our
trust and faith in God almighty,'' he said.
   ``We cannot allow the radical Democrats to institutionalize
aberrant behavior which is part of the destruction of America,'' he
said.
   A Falls Church High School freshman, Debbie Weisshaar, 14, of
Annandale, Va., said afterwards that she was discomfited by
Robertson's repeated references to God and Christianity.
   ``I wasn't sure if he meant freedom for everyone, or freedom for
the people who believed in what he believed in,'' said the
teen-ager, who is Jewish.
   Robertson has just 17 delegates in the latest Associated Press
count to 788 for Bush and 178 for Dole.

<DATELINE>RMEILEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the chaos and intolerance that is
Lebanon, Rmeileh is an oasis of liberty, a haven for people fleeing
political and social persecution and assassination.
   This coastal town, 19 miles south of Beirut, is what Lebanon
used to be before 13 years of civil war, sectarian hatreds and
religious fanatacism turned it into a wilderness.
   Leftists and other refugees from Beirut and the south have fled
to Rmeileh following a campaign of assassinations by Shiite Moslem
fundamentalists against communists, pro-Iraqi Baath socialists and
other leftists.
   One of the things that makes Rmeileh different from just about
everywhere else in south Lebanon is that alcohol is sold openly at
the side of the road.
   Alcohol is banned in most areas of the region, dominated by
Shiite Moslem factions, and in Beirut's southern slums, the Shiite
stronghold in the capital.
   Islamic religious laws also ban mixed parties, mixed bathing and
the consumption of pork.
   But in the summer, Rmeileh's eight restaurants and three miles
of Mediterranean beaches and hillside picnic areas are packed with
males and females having a good time. Pork also is sold.
   Hamza, 35, comes from the staunchly Shiite town of Nabatiyeh in
the south.
   ``We can't buy drinks in Nabatiyeh any more, so we come to
Rmeileh,'' he said. ``In summer women have to come here to swim
because it's the one of the very few places they can do that.''
   Because he lives in a Shiite area, where such activities are
forbidden, Hamza declined to disclose his full name.
   Rmeileh was a mainly Christian town, with about 5,000 Maronite
Catholics, until 1985, when Moslem forces overran the coastal
plain. Now only about 60 Maronite families are left.
   But Rmeileh now is protected by Communist Party militiamen, most
of them Christians, who are allied to neighboring Druse and Sunni
Moslem forces who help keep the Shiites out.
   The Syrian army also has a checkpoint just south of Rmeileh on
the Awali River which also acts as a deterrent for Shiite gunmen.
   Abu Rim, a leftist official in the town, said 500 refugee
families _ Moslems, Christians and Palestinians _ live in Rmeileh
with the local Christians.
   ``Our aim is to get rid of the sectarian atmosphere and
implement co-existence,'' he said.
   Elias Tabet, director of the town's government school, said
ethnic mix gives Rmeileh a non-sectarian nature, where people from
different areas and religions ``feel safe and free.''
   Samih Germanos, 57, a Christian who fled Beirut's
Shiite-controlled southern slums, said: ``We're very happy and hope
things will stay this way.''
   Acting Mayor Halim Kleib, said the tourist influx last summer
was even better than pre-war times.
   ``People in the south prefer Rmeileh to other places because
it's the closest resort to them that provides restaurants and
private beaches as well as drinks,'' Kleib added.
   Ali Hujeiri, 40, a father of nine, who works at a Pepsi Cola
plant in a nearby town, said he sells alcohol on the street to earn
extra money and that most of his customers are from the Shiite
south.
   ``I'm the only one to sell pork in this area,'' said Abu Elie, a
32-year-old shopowner.``I started bringing it from Mount Lebanon
last week and in four days, I sold around 40 kilograms (88
pounds).''
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal movement and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah (Party of God) have been blamed for many
of the assasinations of leftists in south Lebanon.
   But since many of those who have fled to Rmeileh _
``self-deportees,'' Amal calls them _ are skilled or professional
people, the Amal recently asked them to return to their villages.
   Wafiq Rihan, a 33-year-old Shiite school teacher, didn't sound
as though he is ready to return. He said that after he fled
Nabatiyeh last year the Communists and the leftist Druse ``helped
us find places to stay and in the beginning we relied on Red Cross
supplies.''
   ``I'm teaching at the school now,'' he added. ``I was originally
a teacher. But most of the other deportees here are also working in
their particular fields, medicine, the law, and so on.
   ``One doctor who fled Nabatiyeh even has some of his old
patients come here to see him for treatment.''
   Rihan said he wants to go back to his own village but only when
it's safe.

<DATELINE>ARURA, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Palestinians on night guard
duty, masked and armed with clubs, sprinted down the main village
road passing the word: ``Israeli soldiers are coming!''
   Behind them, about 20 more moved in the dark with the speed of
practice to block the road in a half-dozen places. They dragged
stockpiled boulders and twisted metal onto the pavement to slow the
12 jeeps in the Israeli patrol.
   Palestinians whose faces were hidden by checkered keffiyeh
headdresses whistled shrilly to each other across the rocky hills,
tracking the army's progress on the narrow road.
   The overnight citizen patrol was in action, witnessed in this
case by a journalist. The patrol at Arura was one of dozens
organized after the army started nighttime raids, arresting
hundreds of alleged agitators in an effort to quell nearly four
months of violent anti-Israeli protests.
   Jamal, 30, stood watch atop a ridge on the outskirts of Arura, a
village of 2,200 Palestinians that sprawls over hills of the
occupied West Bank about 20 miles north of Jerusalem.
   ``Because of these patrols, we are ready for an attack from
anywhere,'' he said. ``But there is more than that. The guard duty
makes us unified as a people. Everyone feels he has a part in the
uprising.''
   Arab patrols are clandestine and all those interviewed would
agree only to the use of their first names.
   Riots began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel
has occupied since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war. More than 100 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier
have been killed.
   The patrols are a sign of the changing nature and steady
escalation of the ``intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising. They
illustrate growing sophistication in a rebellion that began
spontaneously and, for that reason, worry Israeli officials.
   ``Illegal local organization could lead to illegal regional
organization, all of it directed against us,'' a military man said
privately.
   On this night the army jeeps stopped short of Arura, parked for
about half an hour, then drove away.
   Why the soldiers approached and left in the latest cat-and-mouse
game was not clear, but the villagers viewed called it a retreat by
the enemy and a victory for themselves.
   Residents said soldiers had approached Arura on three occasions
since the patrols began, but stopped each time when guards alerted
villagers and about 1,000 people gathered in the streets, chanting
and throwing stones.
   Patrolling in Arura, as witnessed on two evenings, is a
methodical and sometimes tense business.
   Men carrying clubs and rocks, their faces covered, stop each
passing car. Strangers are ordered out of their vehicles until they
are determined to be friends and not Israeli soldiers in
plainclothes or Jews from the nearby Ateret settlement.
   Between cars and sightings of soldiers, the sentinels often
engage in mutual pep-talk. They encourage each other to continue
the fight against Israel, make optimistic predictions about the
uprising and sometimes ward off the night cold with a shared glass
of sweet herb tea.
   Tahir, 23, said he would stand guard until 5 a.m. then leave for
his job in an Israeli factory, where he packs oranges.
   ``I'm one person at night and another in the day,'' he said.
``In Israel, they have no idea that I am taking my turn, once a
week, on patrol.''
   Nightly patrols were organized in Arura about a month ago after
the army had made four raids in a six-week period, arresting 21
young men.
   Israeli soldiers have rounded up more than 700 Palestinians in
the past week in an effort to end the rebellion, and about 3,000
have been detained since the violence began.
   Soldiers are ordered to make arrests overnight, when most people
are sleeping, to avoid causing violent protests.
   ``They won't catch us sleeping here and they won't be able to
arrest us. We are watching for them every night,'' said Salah, 22,
one of 250 men of Arura aged 16 to 45 who take turns on guard duty
from about 8 p.m. until dawn.
   Boys under 16 are not taken for the patrols, but many children
are eager to do their part.
   Four boys huddled for warmth over smoldering embers in a small,
smoky cave beside the road to the village.
   They said they would remain until 2 a.m., and if a man came
running with word of approaching soldiers they would race through
the rocky hills helping wake the villagers.
   ``I feel like a man because I am doing something to resist the
Israelis,'' Yassin told a reporter with a solemnity far beyond his
11 years. ``This is in the interest of our homeland. It is the duty
of everyone to help.''

Crisis</HEAD>

   Fund-raisers for Lyndon LaRouche were ordered to
tell people they owed the political extremist money because he was
preventing Soviet aggression and global economic collapse, a former
LaRouche aide testified.
   The fund-raisers also were told that LaRouche needed the money
to pay for security to protect him from assassins, former aide
Charles Tate testified Thursday at the federal trial of LaRouche,
six aides and five LaRouche political groups.
   Tate said LaRouche followers were treated as soliders and warned
repeatedly that falling short of daily quotas was ``the moral
equivalent of treason'' and would result in the immediate collapse
of Western civilization.
   Tate testified that LaRouche's top fund-raising operative, Will
Wirtz, said prospective donors should be told LaRouche prevented a
Soviet takeover, was the only Democratic presidential candidate not
under KGB influence and the only man on earth who could prevent
global economic disaster.
   The warnings were given in late 1983 and 1984, when LaRouche
followers were under stringent fund-raising quotas because of his
campaign and the pending move of organization headquarters from New
York to Leesburg, Va., Tate said.
   LaRouche, a candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination, is charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand
jury investigation into allegations that his followers raised more
than $2 million through credit card and loan fraud.
   Four LaRouche organizations, including his two 1984 campaign
committees, are charged with fraud. Those organizations and a fifth
LaRouche group are charged in the alleged obstruction, as are the
six aides.
   Prosecutors, through Tate, are attempting to show that intense
pressure from LaRouche led followers to solicit loans by falsely
promising they would be repaid and by submitting unauthorized
charges to the credit card accounts of past donors to LaRouche
causes.
   LaRouche and defense lawyers have conceded some Boston
fund-raisers might have committed credit card fraud but contend
LaRouche and top aides relieved those fund-raisers of their duties
when allegations of impropriety surfaced.
   LaRouche contends the allegations of nationwide fraud were
concocted as part of a Reagan administration plot to ruin him
because he opposed Contra aid and because his fund-raising competed
with former White House aide Oliver North's private effort to
resupply the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when Congress had halted
government aid.
   The 125-count indictment against LaRouche and the other
defendants, however, charges that three Boston fund-raisers were
ordered by LaRouche to destroy records and flee the country to
avoid being called before the grand jury. The three were indicted
but are fugitives.

   The slaughter of Kurdish civilians in
Iraqi poison gas attacks and Iranian warnings of retaliation
underscore the growth of the chemical warfare arsenals of major
Middle East powers.
   Despite efforts to curb such weapons, their spread has added a
dangerous new dimension to conflicts in the volatile Middle East.
Their use, but not their production, is banned under a 1925 Geneva
agreement.
   The London-based Jane's Defense Weekly noted in a recent study
that the use of poison and nerve gases since 1984 in the
7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war has ``changed the rules of war in the
Middle East.''
   Tehran charges that Iraqi warplanes have dropped chemical bombs
on several villages in northwestern Iraq after Iranian forces
overran the Kurdish area in a round offensive.
   Western correspondents in Iran have reported evidence to
substantiate Iranian claims that 5,000 Iraqi Kurds were killed and
another 5,000 injured when Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs
on towns captured by the Iranians in northeast Iraq last week.
   Nicholas Beeston of The Times of London reported from Halabja,
one of the towns, that ``hundreds and possibly thousands'' of the
Kurds, who have been rebelling against Baghdad for years, were
killed.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's Parliament and Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's representative on the Supreme Defense Council,
warned Thursday that Iran will be forced to use chemical weapons in
retaliation if the Iraqi attacks continue.
   The intensity of Tehran's accusations against Iraq in recent
days has heightened fears that the Iranians may be seeking to
justify using chemical weapons of their own.
   U.S. State Department Spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday
there was evidence Iran may already have fired chemical artillery
shells into Iraq. He declined to elaborate.
   ``It's entirely likely that the Iranians could do so,'' said Don
Kerr of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London
in a telephone interview.
   ``They've had these weapons used against them for a long time.''
   Iraq, a signatory to the 1925 agreement, has been condemned by
the United Nation four times since 1984 for using chemical weapons.
   The Iranians claim the Iraqis have launched around 100 chemical
attacks in that period, mainly against Iranian troops.
   Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas fighting the Baghdad regime
for autonomy have claimed scores of such attacks on their villages
in the last year. But last week's bombing appears to have been the
worst chemical attack in the Persian Gulf conflict.
   Germ warfare dates back to the 14th Century, when the Tartars
catapulted the rotting corpses of plague victims into the besieged
Crimean city of Kaffa in a bid to spread disease.
   Modern chemical warfare began at on April 22, 1915, at 5 p.m.
when the Germans released 180 tons of chlorine gas at Ypres on the
Western Front in World War I.
   Within an hour, 5,000 French soldiers were dead or dying from
the wind-blown gas rolling a few fet above their trenches.
   By the end of the war, gas had killed 100,000 men and affected
more than 900,000 others. Modern nerve gases are far more lethal.
   Iraq has the biggest chemical weapons armory in the region, with
sizable stocks of poison and nerve gases produced at three
top-secret plants, Western military analysts told The Associated
Press.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymnity, said Iraq is
now producing Sarin, a highly lethal nerve gas that can kill in
less than 10 minutes.
   They said there are indications that the Iraqis are also working
on germ warfare weapons.
   The sources estimated that Iraq can now produce 60 tons of
mustard gas a month and four tons each of Sarin and Tabun, another
highly lethal nerve agent.
   Tabun, first developed by Nazi Germany before World War II but
never used, is a colorless gas that attacks the body's muscular
centers and causes asphyxiation within 15 minutes.
   The sources said the Iraqis' main production plant is at
Samarra, a heavily guarded 10-square-mile complex ringed by
Soviet-supplied Sa-2 anti-aircraft missiles 70 miles north of
Baghdad.
   On the other side, Iran's chief military spokesman, Kamal
Kharrazi, has said his country is producing chemical weapons.
   The analysts and diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Iranian chemical weapons are believed to be mainly
mustard and phosgene gases.
   Kerr noted: ``These are relatively simple to manufacture from
readily available industrial components, as is hydrogen cyanide.
Only the more complex nerve gases are likely to pose a chemical
challenge to the Iranians.''
   The Syrians, Moscow's main Arab ally, also have developed their
own chemical weapons industry over the last few years, intelligence
and diplomatic sources said.
   The Israelis allege the Syrian chemical warfare capability is a
serious threat and say Syria has the means to deliver nerve agents
with Soviet-supplied SS-1 Scud-B missiles and combat aircraft.

<TEXT>
   In the uphill climb to the Moscow summit, the
United States this week made a couple of proposals to the Soviet
Union on a new treaty to sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons.
   One was the exemption of spy satellites from treaty
restrictions. The other was that U.S. and Soviet negotiators make a
supreme effort to define space-based testing and deployment.
   The Soviets seemed taken with the satellite proposal, but
sharpening definitions of space tests and space deployments could
be very difficult. There's always been a question whether
technology sent into space is part of a permissible test or is a
tricky step toward an illicit anti-missile deployment.
   In any event, with the Moscow summit meeting only nine weeks
away, the outlook for completing the new U.S.-Soviet treaty is not
bright.
   The biggest problem is verification _ making sure cutbacks are
carried out.
   Two types of long-range weapons are especially hard to monitor.
One is the land-based mobile missile. The other is the sea-launched
cruise.
   Experts assisting Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze were unable to resolve the
problem during three days of talks here.
   And yet, the two sides apparently still intend to try to include
the weapons in the accord with all bombers, submarines and missiles
having a range in excess of 3,000 miles.
   The Soviets proposed a joint experiment next month to see
whether monitors could determine if an American ship was carrying
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.
   The United States rejected the proposal as unlikely to solve the
detection problem.
   On another front, a little headway was made.
   The U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, probably the biggest
obstacle to the treaty, and the Soviet space defense program will
be dealt with separately by the negotiators.
   The Soviets claim the U.S. program, known popularly as Star
Wars, violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. They have
threatened at various times to hold up a new accord to reduce
strategic nuclear weapons unless the U.S. program to develop a
defense against ballistic missile were curbed.
   That ``linkage'' has not been removed.
   Shultz told reporters Wednesday night ``the two things move in
parallel.'' In other words, the Soviets are retaining the right
suddenly to halt progress on arms reductions unless the United
States slows down SDI.
   ``Both sides have worked hard and some progress has been
realized in a number of areas, but much more needs to be done,''
the two sides said in a communique winding up three days of talks.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze will meet again in Moscow on April 21.
Meanwhile, U.S. and Soviet negotiators will keep trying to agree on
three drafts for the treaty. One deals with the elimination of
weapons, another with verifying the cutbacks and the third with the
size and location of U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals.
   Before flying home, Shevardnadze called the rejected Soviet
proposal to verify sea-launched cruise missiles a breakthrough in
verification. He said the Soviets had similar ideas for monitoring
mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles and air-launched cruises.
   ``I hope that at the April round we will find solutions for a
number of these problems,'' the Soviet foreign minister said.
   But he was not all that optimistic about concluding a treaty
before the June 29 summit meeting.
   ``I can't guarantee that a treaty will be signed in Moscow, but
it is a possibility, given enough effort,'' he said.

   For 58 hours after a toddler tumbled into
an abandoned well, hundreds of rescuers worked together to free
her, but now an effort to bring their heroism to television has
divided them.
   Two groups _ one mostly volunteer rescuers and the other city
officials _ are negotiating separately with different TV producers
for a movie of the story that captured the nation's attention as it
unfolded live on television.
   Both groups are awaiting the endorsement of Chip and Cissy
McClure, whose 23-month-old daughter Jessica became stuck in a
22-foot-deep well for 58 hours in October.
   One volunteer rescuer, Bruce Peeler, said he is remaining
neutral in the dispute. But he said he wonders whether the story
could be told properly in any case.
   ``I am wondering if a unified group got together ... if a really
true, accurate picture of what took place could ever be put on the
screen,'' said Peeler, president of Midland's Airmaster Equipment
Corp., which contributed drilling materials for the rescue.
   The effort brought praise and a spotlight to Midland, an oil
town of 97,400 people in western Texas.
   ``It was a special event. There was so much effort, and everyone
had their own story. Maybe it should be kept special like that,''
he said Thursday.
   The Jessica McClure Rescuer's Association, a group of about 30
volunteers, is committed to a movie deal with Los Angeles producer
Larry Spivey, president of Highland Communications Group Inc. The
group has asked all rescuers to join them.
   The association's president, Kragg Robinson, said 33 members
have signed a contract that includes an initial $200,000, plus
future payments, to be divided among the membership.
   The other group, the McClure Rescue Association, has narrowed
its selection to an unidentified producer but has not signed any
commitments. The association, comprising 11 municipal officials
including Police Chief Richard Czech, Fire Chief James Roberts and
paramedic Robert O'Donnell, wants nothing to do with Spivey.
   ``We found that he was going around to individual members of our
association offering each member side deals that the others didn't
know about,'' said Martin Allday, a lawyer representing the group.
   Spivey says everyone was offered the same deal _ a chance to
consult in the production or to act in it.
   Either group or neither group could end up actually making a
film. Spivey still needs a commitment from a network for his
project.
   ``My advice to anyone is if they have not signed with the
producer to not do so until the McClures say who they want the
movie to be made by,'' said Allday.
   The McClures have said they don't want to profit by their
daughter's story, but do not want to stand in the way of the story
being told.
   Peeler said Thursday he is concerned that the group of municipal
workers will not allow others to help negotiate a movie deal.
   He said he and other neutral volunteers are working to bring the
groups together ``so that the same type of unity and spirit as
depicted last October can return.''
   ``I'm sad about this problem,'' he said. ``My concern is that
there were several hundred people out there and it is not right
that maybe the lady that brought us hamburgers at three in the
morning, or the guy who brought the sanitary privvies down _ how do
you say they should not be in the movie, too?''

<HEAD>Officials Examining Travel Records Of Couple In HHS Positions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Health and Human Services is
trying to determine whether a couple employed by the agency and
earning more than $100,000 a year improperly billed it for more
than $3,600 in personal expenses.
   HHS spokesman Chuck Kline said Thursday that department general
counsel Ron Robertson is heading the ethics board inquiry, which is
not expected to take more than a few days.
   The review was started after a Washington newsletter _ the Child
Protection Report _ obtained copies of travel vouchers for Paget W.
and Terry A. Hinch under a Freedom of Information Act request.
   Paget Hinch is associate commissioner of the family youth
services bureau of HHS. Her husband, Terry, is director of the
Social Security office of communications technology. Both are
political appointees who began working at HHS in 1985.
   The newsletter said the couple flew to the San Francisco area,
near the Hayward, Calif., home of Terry Hinch's family for a
one-week stay over Thanksgiving 1985, apparently taking their child
with them.
   They billed the government a total of $2,224 for that trip.
Paget Hinch's voucher said her purpose was to visit shelters for
runaway youth in the area. Terry Hinch said he attended a
conference and met with a video company in connection with a film
on the government's disability insurance program.
   The newsletter said Paget Hinch charged the government $1,410
for a 1987 Thanksgiving trip to the same area.
   Neither of the two people under investigation could be reached.
Officials in the branches where they work said it would be
inappropriate for them to comment while the matter was under review.
   Paget Hinch is paid about $57,000 a year and her husband about
$55,000.

   Brochures besmirching the legend of
Robin Hood were ordered publicly burned by an unlikely defender of
the medieval hero, the sheriff of Nottingham.
   Sheriff Royce Young told councilman Brian Marshal, chairman of
the city's tourism committee, to get rid of the glossy color
leaflets that took a skeptical view of the hero of Sherwood Forest.
   A pile of the brochures, which had been on display at the
Nottingham Information Center, were burned publicly on Thursday.
   Royce, whose medieval predecessor was Robin's enemy, said
earlier this month that he would like to see the researchers who
wrote it ``locked in the dungeons of Nottingham Castle.''
   The brochure caused a storm by claiming Robin Hood and Maid
Marian never met, Friar Tuck did not exist and Robin never robbed
the rich to feed the poor but was a highwayman in business for
himself.

   Comedian Bob Hope, buoyed by best wishes from
President Reagan, went home four days after prostate surgery.
   Hope, who will be 85 on May 29, was released from the University
of Southern California Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital on
Thursday morning, said hospital spokesman Gordon Cohn.
   Hope spokesman Frank Liberman wasn't available Thursday and it
was unclear whether the comedian would continue recuperation at his
desert home near Palm Springs or at his Toluca Lake estate 10 miles
northwest of downtown.
   Among well-wishers was Reagan, who telephoned Hope at the
hospital Wednesday, said Cohn.
   Hope had the scheduled surgery Monday. Doctors said he was
referred to a physician who practices at the cancer hospital,
adding that the entertainer doesn't have cancer.

   The legal battle between Playboy publisher
Hugh Hefner and ex-girlfriend Carrie Leigh escalated when she and
famed ``palimony'' attorney Marvin Mitchelson filed a slander suit
seeking $15 million each.
   The suit, filed Thursday in Superior Court, alleges that Hefner
damaged the reputations of Mitchelson and Miss Leigh when he called
a news conference to denounce a ``palimony'' suit they had filed as
a ``criminal misuse of the judicial system.''
   Hefner made the statement March 9 in response to the $35-million
suit filed by Miss Leigh, 24, a former model who alleged that the
61-year-old bachelor had reneged on a promise to marry her, father
her child and support her.
   ``I'm not going to sit still for it, that's all,'' said
Mitchelson, who gained fame representing the women friends of
celebrities in suits seeking divorce-style settlements from their
former live-in lovers.
   ``I think Mitchelson needs to go back to law school,'' Hefner
responded in a statement. ``What he is calling slander are the
charges in our legal response and countersuit _ and we fully intend
to prove them in court.''
   Hefner filed a cross-complaint to Miss Leigh's original suit,
denying he made promises to her and seeking $1 million _ the value,
he said, of jewels, furs and other gifts he gave her.

do a little sidewalk sweeping, but found out after he had moved a
fair amount of dirt that he was cleaning the wrong spot.
   The star of ``Beach Blanket Bingo'' and other surf and sun
movies appeared Thursday at the Academy of Music to plug the
Philadelphia Music Foundation's ``Hall of Fame'' ceremonies next
week.
   Avalon and 10 other native Philadelphian entertainers will be
honored at the $150-a-plate dinner. Brass plaques engraved with
their names also will be installed in the foundation's ``Walk of
Fame.''
   After ceremoniously sweeping a section of the sidewalk in front
of the academy, the actor and singer learned his plaque would be
placed down the street.
   The discovery failed to dampen Avalon's enthusiasm.
   ``This city is what I am. Philadelphia has been home forever,''
he said.
   Avalon said he looked forward to being immortalized in cement
along with such music legends as Pearl Bailey, Chubby Checker,
Bobby Rydell, Dizzy Gillepsie and Dick Clark.
   Avalon, 48, was born Francis Thomas Avallone in south
Philadelphia. He now lives in Hidden Hills, Calif.

   Jazz vocalist Ethel Ennis says she and her
husband have sold their struggling nightclub, bowing to another
club owner in the effort to book top jazz performers in her native
Baltimore.
   ``We just didn't have deep enough pockets to keep it going,''
Earl Arnett, Mrs. Ennis' husband, said at a news conference
Thursday.
   Mrs. Ennis and Arnett have tentatively agreed to sell the club
to Blues Alley Inc., which runs a similar nightclub in Washington.
   Four years in the planning, Ethel's Place was an ambitious,
first-class restaurant and nightclub, booking top jazz acts at its
downtown location. It also served as a home base for Ennis, famed
in the jazz world for her silky vocal stylings.

   Singer Dean Martin was released from the
hospital Thursday, but his doctor ordered him to stay off the rest
of the spring leg of the ``Rat Pack'' reunion tour with pals Frank
Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr.
   Cedars-Sinai spokesman Ron Wise said Martin left the hospital
around 10 a.m. Thursday to continue his recuperation at home.
   The entertainer was hospitalized Monday for treatment of what
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center officials said was an old kidney
ailment that flared up shortly after he, Sinatra and Davis had
embarked on a reunion concert tour.
   Wise said Martin's physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, wants the
entertainer to remain at home for three to four weeks before going
back to work, however.
   The tour of the so-called ``Rat Pack'' buddies, who appeared in
Las Vegas and films together during their careers, will continue
this month and next without Martin, but resumes July 7 in Los
Angeles.

   Every week or so, Patty Ludwin lugs a
rifle out to the back yard, casually aims at a pile of jeans on the
ground, then fires once, twice, so many times she loses count.
   ``It's putting bullets to a good use, rather than going around
killing people with them,'' the fashion designer said, blasting
holes into a pair of blue denims.
   The 33-year-old entrepreneur sells her bullet-riddled Calamity
Jeans for $45 a pair. Her trademark is a leather bull's eye
stitched to the right hip pocket and a spent .357-caliber Magnum
cartridge that dangles from the patch.
   She also creates Calamity Jewels: earrings, necklaces, belts,
boot bracelets, key chains and just about anything else she can
make with dull, lead bullets and the shinier brass and nickel
casings.
   Her jewelry, which ranges in price from $4 to $65, triggered
intense interest at specialty stories from Pittsburgh to Hawaii.
   ``You couldn't wear it with a business suit or a nice dress.
That would be kind of strange,'' said Debbie Bragle of Pittsburgh's
trendy J. DeStefino Cosmetique shop. ``But with the right outfit,
it's great.''
   There are those who wouldn't be caught dead packing the
``loaded'' look.
   ``I wish I were there. I'd picket her. I think it's sick. I
honestly think it's sick,'' said Mr. Blackwell, a Los Angeles
fashion designer and creator of the annual 10 Worst Dressed List.
   Still, the acerbic arbiter of haute couture isn't surprised by
the appeal.
   ``There's a certain amount of fashion madness that will be
bought,'' he says. ``If Seventh Avenue would come out with greasy
paper bags, you'd have every woman (in Manhattan) wearing a greasy
paper bag.''
   In a townhouse in a quiet, woodsy complex 350 miles from New
York City, Ms. Ludwin is taking her best shot at breaking into the
fickle fashion market.
   She took up designer jeans in 1986 after a friend invited her
over for target practice on a roving boyfriend's treasured
possession.
   ``She said he was cheating on her and she was going to take his
favorite pair of blue jeans and shoot holes in them,'' Ms. Ludwin
recalled, laughing.
   Afterward, when the women pulled the tattered trousers down from
the tree, Ms. Ludwin liked what she saw.
   So did the boyfriend.
   And a style was born.
   The next step was to stock up on bullets.
   ``I had to go to these gun shops and these guys looked at me
like I was a space alien,'' Ms. Ludwin says. ``I'd say, `Do you
have anything in silver?' And they're like, `What? What do you mean
silver?'
   ``I was looking at them appearance-wise. They were looking at
them as functional.''
   Once she got the ammunition home, Ms. Ludwin carefully pried
open the .22-caliber cartridges and dumped out the gunpowder. She
then faced the problem of detonating the primer in the shell that
explodes and ignites the gunpowder.
   Being rather gun-shy, she fried the casings in a skillet. ``I
covered it, then I ran because I didn't know what was going to
happen,'' she said. It was ``like popcorn,'' and it worked.
   She forged the de-activated casings with bullets into jewelry,
then peddled her wares from store to store and at craft shows. The
jewelry eventually made its way into shops around the country.
   Buoyed by her success, Ms. Ludwin borrowed a friend's
.22-caliber rifle and branched into jeans last year, using her back
yard or occasionally a friend's farm as her shooting range.
   So far, she has shot and sold more than 200 pairs of jeans,
mostly to folks in their teens, 20s and 30s.
   She has orders for dozens more as well as for skirts, vests and
jackets peppered with small, frayed holes.
   Requests come from as far away as Europe, where people have read
about her efforts.
   Demand is so great she's begun ordering generic clothes in bulk.
   ``A lot of hunters like them because they're into their guns,''
Ms. Ludwin said. ``The teen-agers want to be different.''
   Although she's sold more than $21,000 worth of merchandise, the
divorced mother of one barely is breaking even, due largely to
business start-up costs. Still, she believes hers will be a genuine
``rags to riches'' story.
   ``I totally think this is a great idea and it's going to go,''
she says.``And if it doesn't, I'm sure one day, I will think of
something.''

<HEAD>Nail Salon Can Refuse AIDS Victim, Judge Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A West Hollywood nail salon may refuse an
AIDS victim a pedicure because there is no conclusive evidence on
how the deadly disease is spread, a judge ruled.
   A West Hollywood ordinance banning AIDS discrimination ``fails
to respect the right not to be involuntarily exposed to a risk of
personal harm,'' Superior Court Judge Lawrence Waddington said
Wednesday.
   Paul Jasperson, 36, had sued Jessica's Nail Salon for canceling
his 1986 appointment after employees overheard him telling an
acquaintance he had AIDS. The suit didn't seek damages, only a
court-ordered pedicure.
   ``It is a health issue, not a civil rights issue,'' Paul
Geragos, an attorney for Jessica's, said Thursday. ``The ordinance
is still in place, but the city of West Hollywood took the shotgun
approach and made the ordinance so broad it has to be interpreted
case-by-case.''
   Jasperson's attorney, Gloria Allred, called the decision ``a
slap in the face for the city of West Hollywood, which led the way
in the country with this ordinance.''
   ``This decision leads us into days of darkness and years of
fear,'' she said. She said there isn't ``one documented case in the
United States of anyone getting AIDS from a manicure or pedicure.''
   Lawyers for Jessica's Salon had argued that refusal was
justified because experts aren't positive how AIDS is transmitted.
   ``Is it necessary to maintain your livelihood to expose yourself
to the danger of death?'' Geragos asked during the non-jury trial.
``We're talking about self-protection and self-defense.''

   The mother of two soldiers was
relieved, a shoe store owner was hopeful and opposition leaders
welcomed the Contra-Sandinista cease-fire agreement, but all were
skeptical about whether it will bring peace.
   ``Every mother, even though she doesn't have sons in service,
should be happy about peace,'' said Auxiliadora del Carmen Acevedo,
whose two sons had been drafted into the army. ``Nicaraguans must
not continue dying.''
   ``We urgently need peace in Nicaragua,'' said Mrs. del Carmen
Acevedo, who sells cosmetics in the Roberto Huembes market. ``All
these eight years have been ones of horror.''
   More than 40,000 people have died since the fighting began in
November 1981, two years after the Sandinistas overthrew the
rightist regime of the late President Anastasio Somoza. The economy
is a shambles.
   Representatives of the leftist Sandinista government and Contra
rebels signed a 60-day cease-fire agreement Wednesday night that
promises the Contras a role in Nicaragua's political process.
   Talks beginning April 6 in Managua will seek a permanent peace.
   Alonso Moreno, a 57-year-old shoe store owner, said he hoped the
accord ``improves the economy and business and that everyone
dedicates themselves to producing to put this country back on its
feet.''
   ``This is the most important thing that has happened since 1979
when the Somoza dictatorship was overthrown,'' said Moreno, who has
three nephews in military service.
   ``I believe that those who are most happy with these announced
measures are the thousands of mothers who have sons in the war, the
thousands of prisoners in the country and thousands of exiled
Nicaraguans,'' said Ramiro Gurdian, an opposition leader and
president of the Nicaraguan Agricultural and Livestock Producers'
Union.
   But Gurdian said it should not create false hopes.
   ``The people should not believe that the problem is totally
resolved,'' he said. ``It's not that way. I would like to see in
the short term an adequate solution to the political-military
problem to bring the economy out of bankruptcy.''
   ``One hopes this will occur before May, when land is prepared
for next year's crops _ 87 percent of the country's exports come
from agriculture,'' he added.
   The war and a U.S. trade embargo have cost the country $3.8
billion in lost income, according to government figures.

<TEXT>
   The last surviving commander of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising said he was not invited and had no plans to take
part in government observances marking the 45th anniversary of the
Jewish anti-Nazi revolt.
   Dr. Marek Edelman, 66, a former commander of the Jewish
fighters, said Thursday he will organize a ceremony at Warsaw's
Jewish cemetery April 17 to dedicate a monument to two Polish
Jewish socialist leaders executed by the Soviets during World War
II.
   Edelman, a staunch supporter of the outlawed Solidarity free
trade union, said he has invited Lane Kirkland, chairman of the
AFL-CIO, and Western Europe leaders.
   Several thousand Jews from the United States, Israel and other
countries are expected to come for the weeklong official
observances that culminate April 19 with a ceremony at the Warsaw
monument to heroes of the uprising.
   Edelman said he was not invited to attend the official
celebrations.
   ``They didn't invite me, but I wouldn't have taken part in it
anyway,'' said Edelman, a cardiologist in the central city of Lodz.
   ``I have never taken part in it because I think this government,
which is a totalitarian government, has no right to act in such
matters,'' Edelman said in a telephone interview.
   He had refused an invitation from authorities to participate in
the April 1983 observances of the 40th anniversary of the uprising.
   In the uprising, several hundred poorly armed Jewish fighters
fought a desperate battle resisting the final Nazi drive to
liquidate the ghetto's 60,000 remaining Jews. About 360,000 Jews
had already been deported from the ghetto to Nazi death camps.
   This year, Edelman has invited Poles and foreign guests to join
him at the ceremony at the Jewish cemetery. He said Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa was expected to attend.
   Edelman plans to unveil a stone monument honoring Henryk Erlich
and Wiktor Alter, two leaders of the Bund, a Jewish socialist labor
organization in Poland, who were sentenced to death and executed in
the Soviet Union in December 1941.
   ``It is important for me personally because I was connected with
those people,'' said Edelman, who as a leader of the Bund's youth
organization in the Warsaw ghetto was given a command post in the
uprising led by Mordechai Anielewicz.
   Edelman escaped through the sewers when the Nazis finally
crushed the uprising.
   In addition to Kirkland, Edelman says he has invited members of
the Socialist International including its chairman, former West
German chancellor Willy Brandt, and officials of the European
Parliament.
   Edelman said the invitations were sent a week ago and he had not
yet received any responses.
   In his letter to Kirkland, Edelman recalled that U.S. labor
leaders had unsuccessfully intervened with Soviet authorities to
seek the release of the two Bund leaders.
   ``Your presence shall be an expression of solidarity with all
unionists and workers fighting for their rights and freedom,''
Edelman wrote to Kirkland.
   Edelman invited the Socialist International members to show by
their presence that ``the struggle for freedom, equality and
brotherhood has not ceased, that you solidarize with all those who
are repressed, and that this remains the superior ideal of
socialism.''

   The dollar closed slightly lower against the
Japanese yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market Friday, while
stock prices also fell during the day's trading.
   After opening at 125.68 yen, down 0.62 yen from its close
Thursday, the dollar edged up marginally in midday trading before
closing the week at 125.74 yen, down 0.56 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 113.95-point loser Thursday, closed at 25,626.71
points, down 154.57 points, or 0.59 percent.
   The dollar declined after the overnight setback in New York.
   ``Profit-taking dollar buying stopped the dollar from falling
further,'' said an official of a major commercial bank, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   There were also reports the Bank of Japan bought an estimated
$200-300 million to prop up the sagging currency.
   Commenting on stock exchange dealings, Tadaaki Uehara of Wako
Securities said ``the decline mirrors setbacks of both the dollar
and stock markets overseas.''
   He said, however, trends on the overseas markets did little to
affect Tokyo as investors remained confident about the condition of
the Tokyo market.
   On Wall Street Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Stock Average
lost 43.77 points, closing at 2,023.87.
   Institutional investors were sidestepping the market to watch
for movements, Uehara said.
   Tokyo shares on the first section plunged over 250 points early
in the session as the dollar's declined below the 126 yen-level and
following sharp losses in New York stock trading overnight.
   Trading volume on the first section at the close of the morning
was estimated at a light 370 million shares.

   The Transportation Department is taking steps
that could exempt farmers and their families from a new law
requiring special licenses to drive trucks.
   Much to the relief of the agricultural community, the agency
said Thursday it will consider excluding farmers and firemen from
proposed truck licensing regulations scheduled to take effect in
July.
   Unless changed, the rules will require a commercial license for
anyone to drive a truck weighing more than 26,000 pounds or any
vehicle with a hazardous cargo.
   The regulations are to implement provisions of a 1986 law to
improve highway safety by establishing a uniform system of truck
and bus driver licensing.
   Farmers have complained that the law could cover some large
trucks used to transport grain and hay or even pickups carrying
bulk fuel tanks and some fertilizers.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., chief sponsor of the licensing law,
welcomed the department's announcement, calling it ``an important
step toward ensuring that the 1986 act ... does not necessarily
burden farm families that operate trucks in the course of daily
business.''
   Congressmen have also been deluged with mail from associations
representing many of the nation's 225,000 paid and 900,000
volunteer firefighters who see costly new rules being imposed on
their members.
   The law gives the secretary of transportation the power to
exempt categories of vehicles from the licensing provisions, which
in general would require an extensive written and road test for a
commercial driver.
   The department, which has not issued its final licensing
regulations spelling out those standards, said it would open a
special proceeding to consider waivers for some classes of farm
vehicles and some firefighting trucks. This regulatory step is
necessary before the agency can grant an exemption.
   ``I can't imagine opening up a comment period ... and then not
granting an exemption for farmers and firemen,'' said Rep. Pat
Roberts, R-Kan., ``It's my interpretation that they will be
exempted.''
   Contending that the regulations would burden these drivers,
rural lawmakers like Roberts have introduced legislation to exclude
locally used farm trucks and firefighting vehicles from the new
regulations.
   Transportation Secretary James H. Burnley IV has indicated that
the Federal Highway Administration would move ``as expeditiously as
possible towards resolution of this issue'' after it receives
comments.
   The law, which takes effect this year, is being phased in to
give the states time to adjust their licensing systems to meet
federal minimum standards of large commercial trucks.
   Truck drivers generally will have until April 1992 to obtain a
commercial license which complies with the federal standards
although states may set earlier deadlines.

   After more than a year and a half perched
atop two 43-foot poles to raise money for cancer research, Mellissa
L. Sanders came down to earth to a place in the record books and
the fiance she has never dated.
   ``Everything looks so small, so different from here,'' Miss
Sanders, 19, said Thursday after a fire truck's bucket brought her
down from the three-story-high shack where she spent 517 days with
her feline companion, Pole Cat.
   ``My knees are wobbly but I feel great,'' said Miss Sanders, who
was embraced by her mother, Mauri Rose Sanders.
   ``Without the cat, I would never have made it,'' she said. ``It
was pretty cramped quarters, but it wasn't so bad. I'll miss it.''
   Miss Sanders' shack in the sky measured 6-by-7-by-9 feet. It had
a plastic kiddie pool for bathing, a chemical toilet, television
and a telephone that resulted in regular $300 phone bills.
   Among the 1,000 people waiting on the ground for Miss Sanders
was her fiance, 25-year-old Keith Seal of Monterey, Calif.
   ``She's kind of hesitant,'' Seal said. ``She's wondering what's
going to happen and knows she'll miss all the attention.''
   The pole sitter thanked her sponsors, and accepted bouquets and
contributions. Then she climbed into a stretch limousine for a
drive around town. Miss Sanders said she was looking forward to ``a
good long walk and a real shower.''
   She raised $10,000 for cancer research, but had hoped her effort
would bring $100,000. Her sister, Rebecca, has cancer and has been
in remission for four years.
   The Tucson, Ariz., native broke the world pole sitting record
Feb. 26 when she overtook the 488-day mark set by Mark Sutton of
Victoria, British Columbia, winning her a place in the Guinness
Book of World Records.
   Pole sitting runs in the family. Her mother set a record in 1959
by spending 211 days in the air.
   ``I'm sure she'll look back on this with fond memories,'' said
Miss Sanders' aunt, Tanya Bowles of Indianapolis. ``Maybe she saved
a life by doing this. And that's about all you can ask for.''
   Firefighters were on hand to make sure Miss Sanders got down
safely.
   ``She's going to look up and be lonely when she passes by here
next,'' said Perry Township Fire Chief David Betzner. ``It's been
her home and when you take someone out of their home _ no matter
how much they want to go _ they're going to look back with
longing.''
   However, Seal said Miss Sanders was not coming down a moment too
soon. ``I've been waiting a year for this,'' he said.
   Mrs. Sanders agreed it was time for her daughter to return to
earth.
   ``All this doesn't seem real,'' said Mrs. Sanders. ``We want her
back with us, but honestly it seems like only yesterday that she
went up there.''
   Before coming down, Miss Sanders said there ``were some real sad
times, times that were real hard.''
   ``But I always knew I would make it, even when I was scared or
going through hard times,'' said Miss Sanders, who rode out 70 mph
winds during a February snowstorm.
   Miss Sanders plans to return to Arizona in May, and hopes to go
to a trade school there.
   Seal first contacted Miss Sanders after reading a newspaper
story about her in November 1986. They communicated, but did not
meet in person until November 1987.
   ``Now that she's getting down, we have to start dating,'' said
Seal. ``I mean we're already engaged and we haven't even gone on a
date.''
   He predicted that the next time the couple passed by the
intersection where they first met, ``I'll probably look up, then
over to her and say she was crazy for spending a year and a half of
her life up there.''

   Trumpeter Al Hirt missed a charity concert after
being hospitalized with an infection in his playing hand, but
doctors said his prognosis was excellent.
   ``I'm OK,'' Hirt said Thursday. ``I had this infection or
something in my hand. It's like blood poisoning. It looks like it's
from a bite or something. It's all swollen and has red streaks.''
   Hirt, 65, flew from his home in New Orleans Thursday and was
admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital after consulting with his
longtime friend, famed heart surgeon Michael DeBakey.
   Doctors said the infection spread throughout his right hand and
arm. Hirt was being given antibiotics intravenously.
   Hirt said doctors think the problem may be related to his
trumpet playing and a growth that has developed on one of the
fingers of his right hand.
   ``I've never had anything like this before in my life,'' he
said. ``I've been playing for 59 years and I want to keep playing
... I'm going to be OK as long as I can keep blowing the trumpet.''
   Hirt missed a charity concert Thurday night to benefit New
Orleans' symphony. He also said he would miss a weekend appearance
in Fairfield, Conn.

<HEAD>Robertson Folds Colorado Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Americans for Robertson campaign has folded in
Colorado just when the organization's telephone bank was beginning
to build momentum for the April 4 precinct caucuses, says one of
the candidate's supporters.
   Former campaign coordinator Clarence ``Arch'' Decker said
Thursday the directive to close the operation came more than a week
ago from Robertson officials in Chesapeake, Va.
   Decker said the order surprised him, adding: ``We were on a
course to take more than half the caucuses in the state.''
   He said the action was ``probably a decision that Colorado
doesn't rank high on the priority scale. We had a bank account, but
they ordered it closed and directed that the records be sent to
them.''

   Barbara Bush says she shuns watching
television coverage of the presidential campaign so she can avoid
the criticism her husband, Vice President George Bush, attracts as
a candidate.
   ``I don't watch it on television; I don't read about it,'' Mrs.
Bush said. ``In order to be able to survive what a campaign does to
you, you have to sometimes stick your head in the sand like an
ostrich and block it out.''
   Mrs. Bush, campaigning Wednesday in Cincinnati, said she spends
her spare time on the campaign trail reading novels or watching
movies. Mrs. Bush said she reads ``about a book a day, more than

   New Orleans police are threatening to strike

   Sgt. Ron Cannatella, president of the Police Association of New
Orleans, said efforts to win a raise have gotten nowhere thus far.
   ``We are the lowest-paid police department in the country,'' he
said. He offered no figures to support that claim.
   Cannatella said Wednesday the union _ with a membership of 900

   ``Unless something happens, this city will see some kind of job

<HEAD>Cyclosporine Used in Cadaver Skin Grafts on Burn Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY McDONALD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A potent anti-rejection drug can safely be
administered orally to severe burn patients, and appears to help
skin grafts from cadavers last longer, says a leading burn
specialist.
   ``I think it's a good first step, but it needs a lot more
work,'' Dr. A. Richard Grossman, who used the immunosuppressant
drug cyclosporine on 13 patients, said in an interview Thursday.
   Grossman, a plastic surgeon and director of the Southern
California Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital in Los
Angeles, was to report his findings today at the American Burn
Association's annual meeting here.
   Cyclosporine has been used in injection and oral form to prevent
rejection by the body's immune system of newly transplanted hearts
and other organs.
   Grossman said his work over the past year and a half showed that
oral doses of the drug are also safe for skin transplants.
   He said it also appears that cyclosporine enables cadaver skin
to ``take'' to the body's skin longer, reducing the need for
several expensive cadaver skin grafts and providing a more
attractive appearance than laboratory-grown skin.
   Without cyclosporine, cadaver skin is rejected within a week to
10 days, he said. Cadaver skin is mainly used to buy time for a few
weeks until the patient has enough skin of his or her own to be
transplanted. Repeated cadaver skin grafts are made until that time.
   Dr. David Herndon, chief of staff at the Shriners Burn Institute
in Galveston, Texas, has not seen Grossman's study, but said the
prolongation effect appears to represent ``tremendous potential.''
   Grossman said more studies comparing cadaver skin transplants
with and without the drug need to be done.
   Grossman is not the first burn specialist to use cyclosporine on
severe burn patients. Dr. Bruce Achauer of the University of
California at Irvine used injections of the drug with poor results,
and later used an oral dose on one patient, who survived, Grossman
said.
   Grossman said he decided to try lower, oral doses.
   Because of concern over kidney failure in burn patients, the
Grossman study on nine patients referred to in his paper and on
four subsequent patients used increasingly lower doses.
   ``Our original purpose was to let the cadaver skin stay on a
while until we could reharvest the patient's own skin,'' Grossman
said. ``But we found after about three or four weeks that it was
staying on for good.''
   The first patient in the study was kept on cyclosporine for two
months after his discharge from the hospital, Grossman said. ``But
with each successive patient we found they needed less and less''
cyclosporine.
   With the last patients in the study, the medication was
discontinued before discharge, within six weeks of the injury.
   ``I don't believe that using cadaver skin with a possibly
dangerous drug is the be-all and end-all,'' Grossman said. ``I
think we're plugging a dike until the right thing comes along.''
That, he said, would be improvements in the use of laboratory-grown
skin.

   Corrupt city health inspectors doubled and
tripled their annual salaries by extorting hundreds of thousands of
dollars from restaurants, federal officials said after the arrest
of more than two dozen employees.
   ``The restaurant owners would dread seeing these inspectors pull
up in their Cadillacs and Rolex watches,'' said James Fox,
assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office. ``They
turned the Department of Health into their own Department of
Wealth.''
   City health-code inspections of restaurants will be temporarily
suspended while the Department of Health reorganizes.
   ``The revelations of widespread and longstanding corruption
among restaurant inspectors are particularly repellent and painful
because of the importance'' of public health, Health Commissioner
Stephen Joseph said.
   Twenty-eight people, including health inspectors, their
supervisors and former Health Department employees who acted as
middlemen, were charged Thursday with extorting money from
restaurateurs. The Health Department employees earned annual
salaries of $25,000 to $30,000.
   If convicted, each could face a maximum penalty of 20 years in
jail and a fine of $250,000.
   The charges contained in the complaint represent about one-third
of the employees responsible for enforcing the city's health code,
U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said.
   Inspectors allegedly secured the extortion money by threatening
to cite restaurants for health-code violations.
   About 300 of the city's 15,000 restaurants were victimized,
ranging from fast-food establishments to little ethnic places to
some tony Manhattan spots. A chart released by the FBI showed that
the restaurants were in all five boroughs, with the largest
concentration on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
   The names of the restaurants were withheld because the owners
are considered victims and because the information could hinder a
grand jury investigation, Maloney said.
   The city's Department of Investigations and the FBI combined
separate investigations, dubbed ``Kitchen Net'' and ``Operation
Sanisweep'' respectively, in 1986. They used a combination of
confidential informants, undercover agents and physical and
electronic surveillance.
   Fox said if a restaurant owner refused to give an inspector a
payoff during a regular inspection, the inspector would claim to
find mouse droppings or dead flies in the restaurant and threaten
to issue violations or, in some cases, close the restaurant.
   In one case, on-site inspectors demanded $1,400 from a
restaurant owner to prevent the establishment from being closed for
serious health violations, authorities said. In another, inspectors
charged a Queens restaurant $1,200 to allow it to reopen despite
serious code violations.
   A confidential informant told authorities that he and another
inspector made up to six stops a day and collected $500 to $1,000
in payoffs from owners at each restaurant, according to Fox.
   The extortion payoffs were shared with inspectors' supervisors,
authorities said. One senior inspector was called ``Hungry Joe'' by
his fellow inspectors because he made so many demands.
   In addition, he said, former Health Department inspectors and
others established ``consulting'' companies that would advise
restaurants on how to pass inspections and would act as middlemen
for the extortions.
   Supervisors allegedly would recommend these consulting services
to restaurants and then take a percentage of the consultation fee,
authorities said.

   Before his arrest on fraud charges, a
high-living 23-year-old investment adviser lured customers by
falsely telling them that his other clients included the
Rockefeller family and Bill Cosby, authorities say.
   Those allegations were contained in criminal charges against
David Bloom filed Thursday in U.S. District Court. Bloom is
expected to plead guilty at a court appearance next week, according
to his lawyer, Peter Morrison.
   Bloom, who was not licensed as an investment adviser, allegedly
lied to clients by telling them their funds were invested in the
stock market when he was actually pouring the money _ more than $10
million worth _ into private purchases.
   Among his purchases were works of art totaling $5.5 million; an
$830,000 Manhattan apartment; a beach house in East Hampton worth
$1.9 million; two cars _ an Aston-Martin convertible and a
Mercedes-Benz _ worth $200,000; and home furnishings that cost
$800,000.
   Bloom also bought ``numerous items of expensive jewelry; and
deluxe trips to Europe and the Caribbean for himself, his family
and friends,'' according to the federal charges of mail fraud and
securities fraud.
   The charges say that Bloom ``falsely told investors that he
managed money for prominent individuals and investors, including
the Rockefeller family, the Sultan of Brunei (and) Bill Cosby.''
   In a brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Barbara Lee, Bloom
waived his right to have his case heard by a grand jury. After he
entered a plea of innocent, Ms. Lee assigned the case to U.S.
District Judge David Edelstein.
   Bloom apparently was ready to plead guilty before Edelstein, but
the judge was unavailable and the case was scheduled for next
Thursday.
   If found guilty of the two charges against him, Bloom faces a
maximum sentence of five years in prison on each count and a
maximum fine of twice the amount lost by investors.
   Bloom was arrested Jan. 14 on a federal complaint charging him
with fraud. He had begun investing money for friends while at Duke
University and had 130 clients at his Greater Sutton Investors
Group Inc. in Manhattan at the time of his arrest.
   Morrison has said many of the items Bloom purchased would be
sold and his clients could recover their money and a profit. The
assets were turned over to a court-appointed receiver.

<HEAD>Wedtech Witness Says He Gave $30,000 to D'Amato Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Wedtech Corp. executive says the
scandal-plagued defense contractor contributed to numerous
political campaigns, not because of ideology but ``for favors we
expected to get.''
   Former Wedtech vice chairman Mario Moreno also testified
Thursday that he gave under different names, about $30,000 to Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., to evade election law contribution limits.
   Federal election law limits individual campaign contributions to
$1,000 per election and bars corporate contributions.
   A D'Amato spokesman branded Moreno's testimony ``ridiculous.''
   Moreno's claims came during defense cross-examination at the
racketeering trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others.
   Prosecutors have said D'Amato will testify for the government.
   The prosecution contends Biaggi enlisted the help of D'Amato and
other politicians to help secure no-bid contracts for Wedtech, then
extorted millions of dollars in Wedtech stock as a payoff.
   He and his co-defendants are accused of turning Wedtech into a
racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes
for government contracts and other favors.
   Moreno is among four former Wedtech executives cooperating with
the government in return for leniency on state and federal charges
to which they pleaded guilty.
   Defense attorney Maurice Nessen got Moreno, who was on the
witness stand for the eighth day Thursday, to admit he and other
Wedtech executives contributed to D'Amato and other public
officials who have not been charged with wrongdoing.
   ``Now D'Amato, Sen. D'Amato. There were contributions to his
campaign that you in fact hid and put under different names so you
could violate the limits on campaign contributions. Isn't that
correct,'' Nessen asked.
   `Yes,'' said Moreno.
   When Nessen asked Moreno if he had given D'Amato close to
$30,000, the witness said it might have been more than that.
   ``And all the while, the senator from New York was helping you
get contracts with the government?'' Nessen asked later.
   ``Yes,'' said Moreno, later saying that D'Amato ``was one of the
most important people'' in helping Wedtech secure a
multimillion-dollar Navy contract without competitive bidding.
   Ed Martin, the D'Amato spokesman in Washington, said, ``We have
no knowledge of any secret contributions.''
   He said prosecutors told D'Amato staffers there was ``a lot of
false name-dropping going on'' at the trial. ``This is an example.''
   Moreno said he and Wedtech officials contributed to the
campaigns of Mayor Edward I. Koch, Gov. Mario Cuomo, city
Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and state Sen. John Marchi, none of
whom has been charged with wrongdoing.
   He said contributions were made to the Democratic, Republican
and Conservative parties, not because of political ideology but
``in exchange for favors we expected to get.''
   Asked what favors Wedtech expected from the Republican state
committee, Moreno said, ``We expected to get the Republican Party
in our pocket.''
   ``By giving a check for $2,500?'' Nessen asked incredulously.
   ``By giving a lot of checks,'' Moreno said without elaborating.
   ``What he refers to, I have no idea,'' Ed Lurie, executive
director of the GOP state committee, said in a telephone interview
from his Albany office.
   ``If their (Wedtech officials') purpose was to get some sort of
hook into us, God, we didn't know it,'' Lurie said. ``I didn't know
certain people gave to us until I saw it in the newspapers.''

<HEAD>GM, Government Differ On How To Fix Emission Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is being ordered to
recall nearly 500,000 1985 vehicles for failure to meet federal air
pollution standards, but the automaker and the government are at
odds over how to fix the problem.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, which announced the recall
order Thursday, said a faulty thermal vacuum switch was part of the
reason the vehicles' exhaust contains excess carbon monoxide and
evaporated gasoline.
   GM spokeswoman Jane Mott said the automaker told the EPA it
believed replacing the switch on the vehicles would be sufficient
to bring emissions into compliance with federal standards.
   The EPA, however, said its tests showed that ``replacement of
the (switch) alone will not completely remedy the problem and that
additional repairs may be necessary.''
   GM has 45 days either to request a public hearing to contest the
order, or to submit a repair plan for EPA's approval before notices
are mailed to owners.
   The vehicles affected by the recall are equipped with 5.0 liter
(305 cubic inches) and 5.7 liter (350 cubic inches) engines, the
EPA said.
   They were sold as the Chevrolet Impala, Caprice Classic, Camaro,
Monte Carlo and El Camino; the Pontiac Firebird, Bonneville, Grand
Prix and Parisienne; and the GMC Caballero, EPA said. Models sold
in California, which are built to stricter standards, are also
included.

   The FCC on Thursday proposed to extend compatibility

action was not tough enough and that legislation still is needed to

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people marched in
memory of a slain archbishop while the man accused of ordering the
clergyman's assassination defended his far-rightist party's
nationwide election victory.
   About 10,000 people joined in Thursday's march, which was called
by student, labor, rights and church groups on the eighth
anniversary of Monsignor Oscar Romero's death. The bishop was shot
through the heart by a sniper as he celebrated Mass at a chapel in
San Salvador.
   The marchers carried flowers, large portraits of the
bespectacled bishop and banners saying ``Monsignor Romero did not
die in vain.'' They chanted calls for the prosecution an punishment
of those responsible.
   In the weeks prior to his assassination, Romero called on
members of the security forces to disobey orders to torture, kidnap
and murder their countrymen.
   The late 1970s and early 1980s were a time of intense activity
of Salvadoran death squads. In 1980, when Romero was killed, the
squads of soldiers, police and extremist anti-leftist civilians
were blamed for killing more than 500 suspected leftists a month.
   No one was indicted in Romero's slaying, but President Jose
Napoleon Duarte late last year publicly accused Roberto
d'Aubuisson, a right-wing legislator and former army major, of
masterminding the slaying.
   ``The case is solved. We know who did it, who ordered it, who
drove the getaway car,'' Duarte told the country on nationwide
television in November.
   He accused d'Aubuisson of issuing the order, and said testimony
from the driver of the killer's car backed up his claim.
   D'Aubuisson, the founder and a legislator for the far-rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, denies the charge. He
says it is politically motivated slander.
   Duarte's government has asked the United States for extradition
of a Salvadoran army captain, Alvaro Saravia, who allegedly hired
the sniper. Saravia, arrested for a traffic violation, is in jail
in Miami pending resolution of the extradition request.
   Local authorities say it could be granted in the coming months.
   But whether the case will ever reach court is not clear. As a
legislator, d'Aubuisson enjoys broad immunity from prosecution. His
party was the big victor in Sunday's elections for all 60 members
of the unicameral National Assembly and municipal officials across
this nation of 5 million.
   It is unlikely an Assembly controlled by d'Aubuisson's party
would strip him of immunity to allow him to stand trial as an
alleged conspiritor in Romero's assassination.
   Early returns indicated Arena would hold an outright majority in
the Assembly and most town and city posts nationwide.
   But on Wednesday, Arena leaders charged the governing Christian
Democrats with manipulating returns in an effort ``to steal'' the
right's parliamentary majority. D'Aubuisson and other Arena chiefs
said violence could erupt if the vote count was flawed.
   The Christian Democrats, who had 33 seats in the outgoing
Assembly but are expected to have fewer than 25 in the new one,
deny the charge.
   Arena had 13 seats in the old legislature.
   Talking with reporters Thursday, D'Aubuisson was calmer than the
previous day. But he insisted his party would not permit maneuvers
to erode its electoral result.
   ``The people's will cannot be subverted,'' he said. ``By
tomorrow (Friday) afternoon we believe the Central Elections
Council will be in a position to announce definitive official
results that will confirm the triumph of our party.''
   But there was no promise from the Council that final results
would be ready today.
   Council president Mario Samayoa told reporters: ``We will take
as long as is necessary to make sure the electoral law is
fulfilled, whether certain parties or individuals like it or not.''

   An 18-year-old anti-nuclear activist
charged today he was tortured for two days at the headquarters of
President Corazon Aquino's security force and his companion was
murdered.
   A spokesman for Mrs. Aquino said he was unaware of the
allegations. Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said he
was willing to have authorities investigate the charge.
   Hilario Bustamante recounted his ordeal to reporters who
interviewed him at a government hospital. He was recovering from a
deep wound in the back of his neck doctors said must have been
inflicted with a machete or an ax.
   The injury was similar to that which killed Bustamante's
companion, Rey Francisco, whose body was found by police Monday
night in a field on the outskirts of the capital. The field is near
where a private security guard found Bustamante's near-dead body
hours earlier.
   Speaking in a low voice and unable to move his body, Bustamante
said an unidentified woman was also hacked that same night. Police
have not reported finding any female body in the field.
   Bustamante said he, Francisco and five other members of the
leftist Youth for Democracy and Nationalism were pasting up posters
against nuclear arms and U.S. military bases Saturday when about
six armed men in a jeep chased them.
   He said the men, in civilian clothes, claimed they were police
``authorized by Malacanang (presidential palace)'' to arrest the
youths. The men caught Bustamante and Francisco a few blocks away,
but the others escaped.
   Bustamante claimed he and Francisco were taken to a military
compound behind the presidential palace, where he said they where
they were handcuffed, blindfolded, interrogated and tortured.
   The compound houses the headquarters of the Presidential
Security Group.
   ``They wanted us to admit we were members of the Sparrow Unit,
that we were NPA,'' Bustamante said, referring to the communist New
People's Army and its assassination unit. ``They kept asking us
whether we killed such and such policeman or soldier.''
   ``They beat us with iron rods and burned us with cigarettes,''
he said.
   Late Monday, Bustamente said three men drove him, Francisco and
the woman to the field and hacked them.
   Deputy presidential spokesman Danilo Gozo said he was unaware of
Bustamante's charges.
   ``We will ask the Presidential Security Group, but it sounds
odd,'' Gozo said. ``We will have to check if it is a fact.''
   De Villa called on Bustamante to provide evidence to back up his
charge.
   ``I'm willing to have all these kinds of incidents
investigated,'' he told reporters. ``We do not tolerate, we do not
condone the use of torture. We are willing to subject our people to
genuine investigation.''
   Earlier this month, Amnesty International charged in a report
released in London that the Philippine military was using torture
and murder to fight the 19-year communist insurgency. Mrs. Aquino
called the report one-sided.

<HEAD>Tornado, Large Hail Pound Lower Mississippi Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms pelted parts of Texas and Arkansas early today
with large hail and destructive winds, while a tornado damaged
houses and injured a man in Missouri.
   Showers and thunderstorms lined a cold front that extended from
eastern Wisconsin through the middle Mississippi Valley into
Louisiana. The strongest thunderstorms were scattered from Arkansas
into Louisiana.
   The tornado tore through Texas County, Mo., Thursday evening,
damaging 10 houses and injuring a man when the side of his home
blew out. He was treated for cuts in Texas County Memorial
Hospital, an ambulance official said.
   Officials said the tornado cut a 12-mile path through the
south-central Missouri county, trapping a family in their home
until rescue workers freed them unharmed.
   Jim and Barbara Maples of rural Nixa, Mo., said they jumped out
of their mobile home just minutes before winds tore off the top.
``I just hung on to the pickup and (Jim) said, `there goes the
roof,''' said Mrs. Maples.
   Thunderstorms produced large hail and damaging winds across
Arkansas and northeast Texas late Thursday and early today. Hail 1}
inches in diameter pelted Clarksville and Fannin County, Texas,
while 1-inch diameter hail hit Mena, Ariz., near Checotah, Okla.,
and near DeSoto, Sherman and Dallas, Texas.
   Dierks, Ark., was pounded by wind gusts to 60 mph along with
1-inch hail, and hail of a similar size covered the ground at Tom,
Okla. Texarkana, Ark., had 1-inch hail, heavy rain and winds
gusting to 50 mph.
   Strong thunderstorm winds destroyed a barn and damaged several
houses Thursday night west of Fayetteville, Ark., while a porch
blew off a house near Murray, Ark. Wind damage was also reported in
west-central Illinois.
   Rain fell across much of Minnesota and Wisconsin on Thursday
evening, flooding streets in some sections.
   Rainshowers were scattered Thursday evening across the Pacific
Northwest. Snowshowers were reported at Kalispell, Mont.
   Today's national forecast predicted scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Great Lakes across the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys, the central and southern Appalachians and the central Gulf
Coast to the southern tip of Texas; light snow from upper Michigan
to northern Minnesota; mixed rain and snowshowers in eastern North
Dakota and southern Minnesota; and light rain in coastal sections
of Washington and Oregon.
   Highs temperatures were expected to be in the 30s in northern
Minnesota; in the 40s or 50s in New England, northeast New York,
from Michigan across the upper Mississippi Valley, the northern
half of the Great Plains and northern and central Rockies to the
Pacific Northwest; in the 80s in central and southern Florida and
southern Texas; and in the 80s and 90s from the desert Southwest to
the coastal valleys of Southern California. Elsewhere, highs were
predicted in the 60s or 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 15
degrees at Yellowstone Lake, Wyo., to 75 degrees at Los Angeles.

<HEAD>`The Gospel at Colonus,' A Musical, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs with other critics; no PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   When ``The Gospel at Colonus'' sings, it soars,
raising the roof of Broadway's cavernous Lunt-Fontanne Theater and
the spirits of everyone within shouting distance.
   There isn't a more joyous expression of song on Broadway, and
that may be enough for some people. It's when the production stops
to tell its tale that the show sags, marking time until the next
musical explosion.
   This overlong gospel celebration, which opened Thursday, offers
a sketchy and an often confusing version of Sophocles' ``Oedipus at
Colonus,'' set within the framework of a rousing black Pentecostal
church service. What little is left of the Greek tragedy in Lee
Breuer's adaptation is overwhelmed by religious fervor.
   Oedipus, in this version, comes to Colonus seeking redemption
but is rejected at first by its citizens. When his prayers for
forgiveness are heard by Theseus, king of Athens, Oedipus and his
two daughters Antigone and Ismene are welcomed back to the holy
city.
   The daughters are seized by Creon, king of Thebes, but then
released after the intercession of Theseus. Oedipus then prepares
for a happy death.
   Breuer, according to program notes, sees the show as a sermon or
series of parables on fate, and much of the story is delivered
between songs by a minister, played by Morgan Freeman. He's a
commanding figure on stage but must muddle through the rudimentary
narrative that rarely clarifies its characters.
   The real passion comes from the singers, many of them gospel
music veterans, led by Clarence Fountain and the Five Blind Boys of
Alabama. They all sing different facets of the role of Oedipus.
   Fountain has an ingratiating, swivel-hipped stage presence, a
booming voice and sass to spare. He gets ample support from several
other soloists and gospel groups including Jevetta Steele and the
J.D. Steele Singers and J.J. Farley and the Soul Stirrers.
   The entire production is backed up by the Institutional Radio
Choir, a Brooklyn-based church group. Its 30 members, dressed in
colorful African robes, sit on bleachers that climb high above the
stage. Large Greek columns, designed by Alison Yerxa, rise behind
them.
   The choir shouts its affirmation to much of Freeman's preaching,
and their enthusiasm is infectious. The choir is the focal point of
the evening's two show-stopping numbers _ ``No Never,'' a rousing
hymn of welcome, and ``Lift Him Up,'' a song of redemption after
Oedipus has gone peacefully to his death.
   The music by Bob Telson is melodic, just right for hand-clapping
and toe-tapping, while Breuer's lyrics are simple without being
simplistic.
   Breuer also directed the musical, and he could have trimmed the
show without diluting its impact. As it stands, ``The Gospel at
Colonus'' is often a long wait between the hosannas.
   In other reviews:
   ``This is a show that never stops advertising its
high-mindedness, whether in its program notes or on stage,'' writes
Frank Rich in The New York Times.
   ``But happily, there is the music, too, and it is so rousing ...
that the considerable spoken text ... can never completely upstage
it. ... Even a cynic may feel that the tidal wave of music is
lifting him to some higher, ecstatic plane.''
   In the Daily News, Don Nelson called the conception ``innovative
and brilliant,'' although the show itself ``seemed somewhat longer
than it should be ...''
   But, he said, ``the power of this production cannot be denied.
There is no Broadway musical _ none _ that attains the rarefied
heights that `Gospel' does at its best.''

   Leslie Anne Monk of England won the
less-than-coveted ``Red Lantern'' award, finishing last in the
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and eight days after winner Susan
Butcher.
   The rookie musher crossed the finish line in the 1,150-mile
Anchorage-to-Nome race at 10:22 p.m. Thursday, in 45th place at 19
days, 13 hours, 22 minutes and 55 seconds. Fifty-two teams started
the 16th annual Iditarod on March 5.
   Butcher crossed the finish line on March 16 to claim her third
straight Iditarod victory.
   Monk said she walked 11 of the last 22 miles until a lead dog
that had run in a previous Iditarod recognized the trail and got
the other six moving again.
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior Alaska, draws its inspiration from a 1925
relay of diphtheria serum to Nome, which was hit hard by an
outbreak of the disease.

<HEAD>Former GM President Dies At 72</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elliott ``Pete'' Estes, an engineer who rose
through the ranks at General Motor Corp. to retire as president,
has died after apparently suffering a heart attack, officials said.
He was 72.
   Estes, who lived in Paradise Valley, Ariz., served as GM's 15th
president and chief operating officer from 1974 until his
retirement in 1981.
   He collapsed Thursday outside O'Hare International Airport while
waiting for a ride, police said. He was on his way to a meeting of
the Kellogg Co. board of directors. He was pronounced dead on
arrival at Resurrection Hospital.
   ``Pete Estes was one of GM's brightest stars. In whatever role
he assumed for the corporation, he performed at peak capacity,'' GM
Chairman Roger B. Smith said in a statement.
   A native of Mendon, Mich., Estes began a lifetime relationship
with GM in 1934 when he enrolled at General Motors Institute in
Flint, Mich. He joined GM Research Laboratories as a cooperative
student while at the institute.
   In 1939 he became a research engineer and later worked in the
company's Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Chevolet divisions.
   Estes was named executive vice president for operations staff in
1972 and was elected president by the company's board of directors
in 1974.
   Estes is survived by his wife, Connie, and three sons, Thomas,
Edward and William.

<HEAD>Researchers Identify Problems That Lead To Dangerous Pregnancies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Women who let sexually transmitted diseases go
untreated run the risk of dangerous pregnancies, researchers say.
   Medical investigators at the national Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta explored 22 possible problems they thought might
lead to ectopic or tubal pregnancies, in which the fetus develops
outside the womb.
   Their study is reported in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Ectopic pregnancies occur tens of thousands of times annually,
and account for 10 percent of all U.S. maternal deaths and are a
major cause of infertility, the researchers said.
   They examined 274 cases of ectopic pregnancy diagnosed from 1935
to 1982 in Rochester, Minn., and compared the cases with 548
live-birth deliveries during the same period among similar women.
   One of four problems researchers identified more often among
women with ectopic pregnancies was previous pelvic inflammatory
disease, an infection of the upper genital tract that can result
from untreated diseases of the lower tract.
   The study's lead authors, Polly A. Marchbanks of the CDC, said a
history of venereal disease alone does not appear to increase
ectopic pregnancy risk, but appears to increase risk if it advances
to the upper genital tract.
   That means women have another good reason to seek medical help
if they think they have a sexually transmitted disease, she said.
   Other problems in women with ectopic pregnancies were previous
infertility for at least one year and having undergone reproductive
surgery of the Fallopian tubes, the researchers said.
   And they found a strong association between conception while
using an intrauterine birth control device and ectopic pregnancies.
Women who had an ectopic pregnancy were 13.7 times more likely to
have been using IUDs at the time of conception than women in the
comparison group, the study said.
   A CDC researcher not involved in the study, Dr. Nancy Lee, said
that figure is inaccurate because it compares two groups that
shouldn't be compared: women using birth control and women using no
birth control.
   In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg lodges somewhere in
the abdomen besides the womb. In 97 percent of cases, the site is
in the Fallopian tubes, where as the fetus enlarges, it can rupture
the tubes or cause severe bleeding.
   Though ectopic pregnancy is dangerous, it can now be detected
early and the pregnancy ended surgically before damage makes a
woman infertile, wrote Dr. Robert N. Taylor, in an editorial
accompanying the study.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Softball players would break considerably fewer
bones if breakaway bases replaced anchored bags on recreational
league diamonds, says a study published today.
   ``No system is foolproof, because poor technique can defeat a
lot of safety measures,'' Dr. David Janda, one of the study's four
authors, said Thursday. ``But this is one place where we can do
something almost immediately.''
   Breakway bags could reduce injuries by more than 90 percent,
according to the study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   The study even contains some good news for baseball purists
worried that using breakaway bases would detract from the game's
tradition.
   ``We did not have a single problem about an out call from either
a player or an umpire in the more than 600 games we looked at,''
said Janda.
   ``Not only was there not one complaint, but we had a meeting of
managers after the season, and virtually everybody said we had to
have breakaway bases on the rest of the fields,'' he added.
   Janda, two colleagues from the orthopedic surgery section at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and a director of the city's
softball league gathered data from 633 softball games on diamonds
that used breakaway bases and 627 games on stationary-base fields.
   Stationary bases usually are anchored with a nut-and-bolt type
arrangement in a tube driven into the ground. A set of three
breakaway bases costs $295 vs. $150 for stationary bases.
   The breakaway bases used in the study had two parts: a rubber
plate mounted flush with the ground and a base secured on top with
suction and small rubber grommets that can pop loose.
   There were 45 sliding injuries, or about 7.2 per 100 games, on
the stationary-base fields compared to two, or about 0.3 per 100
games, on the breakaway field _ a ratio of nearly 23-to-1.
   Medical costs for the 45 injuries totaled more than $55,000.
   Dr. Jeffrey Sacks of the Atlanta-based federal Centers for
Disease Control, took the numbers from the study and extrapolated
them nationwide.
   ``If all games were played on stationary bases _ and we know
they're not _ we could expect 1.7 million sliding injuries and
medical costs over $2 billion,'' Sacks said.
   ``Put those same people on fields with breakaway bases and the
numbers are just over 70,000 injuries and $24 million in medical
costs,'' he said.
   Janda said his study revealed that most of the injuries resulted
from ``things like not knowing how to slide, poor conditioning,
late decision-making on when to slide, and even alcohol
consumption.''
   Janda, who described himself as ``a no-hit, no-field'' second
baseman, declined to say how frequently alcohol figured into the
equation.
   ``Nobody on our team drinks,'' he said, ``but we've played teams
where everybody does.''

   Delays in Illinois Medicaid payments could force
private residential-care facilities to evict hundreds of mentally
retarded patients in the coming months, officials say.
   ``If nothing changes, we will see 50 to 1,500 people discharged
from community residential centers throughout the state,'' said
Peter Mule, director of the Riverside oundation, a home for
retarded adults in Lincolnshire.
   Earlier this week Riverside received a reimbursement check from
the state Department of Public Aid for December, but is still owed
at least $250,000 for care provided since then, Mule said.
   Another non-profit agency, Clearbrook Center in suburban Rolling
Meadows, will have to close within three months if $446,000 owed by
the state can't be found elsewhere, center president Guerin Fischer
said.
   Reimbursements are slow now, and they're bound to get worse,
said Edward Duffy, state public aid director. ``I'm not choosing to
do this, I'm running out of money,'' he said.
   Duffy said because the General Assembly underfunded the Medicaid
program by $159 million last year, reimbursement money will run out.
   Requests received after April 15 won't be paid until July, Duffy
said.
   ``We're working along with banks to help these agencies get
credit lines,'' Duffy said. ``But the only real solution is more
money.''
   If the private homes are forced to evict their residents, the
state would have to make room for them in already crowded
facilities.
   ``We would have to put these people up on cots in gymnasiums,''
said David Devane, a spokesman for the Department of Mental Health.
``They would be without programs, without any treatment that is not
life sustaining.''
   Gov. James R. Thompson's proposed $22.2 billion budget for
fiscal 1989 includes a $342 million increase for the Public Aid
Department to pay past-due bills and reduce the delays in Medicaid
reimbursements.

   What do you get when you take a jacket and
combine it with batteries, loudspeakers and a cassette or compact
disc player?
   The Sonic Jacket, which Toshiba America Inc. sees as the logical
next step from portable cassette and CD players.
   ``People are taking their music with them, so forward-thinking
designers thought, `Why not build them into our clothing to keep
the hands free?''' said David Shoults, Toshiba's national sales
promotion manager.
   The Sonic Jacket, developed at Toshiba's Wayne offices, is made
of cotton and twill and has pockets in the front that house four
C-size batteries and a cassette or CD player.
   Five feet of wires sealed by Velcro into the jacket's lining are
connected to four speakers _ two low-frequency speakers in the
lining of chest pockets and two ``tweeter-type'' speakers on the
shoulders, Shoults said.
   The jacket, currently available in limited supplies, has
detachable sleeves, comes in three sizes in white and black, and
sells for $199.95.
   As clothing goes, the Sonic Jacket is not loud, Shoults said.
   ``This is intended to be personal electronics,'' he said. ``You
can't really turn these things up so loud. They just don't play
that loud.''
   Shoults said that if the Sonic Jackets prove to be a success,
sound systems could turn up in a variety of clothing.
   What's next? Sonic Shorts?

   A burglar who stole a computer from
a tax preparer's office turned out to be a user-friendly thief _ he
mailed tax return information on 150 clients back to his victim.
   He also called Elizabeth Savano to apologize, she said Thursday.
   The $9,000 computer and a printer were taken from her office in
this city near Oakland on March 5.
   When Savano opened her office the same day, she found a note
from the thief saying he would return the hard disk containing the
program for calculating taxes and other information. He also called
that day.
   ``I'm still haunted by it,'' Savano said.
   Four days later, Savano received a package in the mail. It
didn't contain the hard disk, but there were 20 floppy disks and a
note from the burglar explaining how he had transferred the
information onto the floppies.
   ``It's just weird,'' Savano said.
   The tax preparer said she was glad the information was returned.
``That helped, but I'm still out the computer.''

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz and his girlfriend
attended the opening of a murder trial of a woman who claims she
stabbed her abusive boyfriend to death in self-defense.
   ``This trial should not be happening,'' Goetz said after opening
arguments in state Supreme Court, the state's trial-level court, in
Manhattan on Thursday.
   Damian Pizarro is accused of killing her boyfriend, Emerson
Gaylor, on Aug. 19, 1986. Her attorney, Peter Neufeld, said Gaylor
began abusing Ms. Pizarro after she became pregnant with his child
in 1984.
   Goetz' girlfriend, Lisbeth Theisen, said the couple decided to
attend ``to show support'' for Ms. Pizarro.
   Goetz is free on bail while appealing his conviction in the
shooting of four teen-agers on a subway train in December 1986.
Goetz, who maintained he fired because he felt threatened, was
convicted last June on a weapons charge.

   More Americans are learning about the causes of
AIDS and discussing it with their kids, according to a new federal
report.
   The National Center for Health Statistics, which launched its
AIDS awareness interviews in August, reports that children are
getting more education about AIDS at school and at home.
   The most notable changes between the November survey results _
the latest available _ and those from one month earlier ``were in
the proportion of adults who reported having discussed AIDS with
their children and who stated that their children had received AIDS
education at school,'' the center reported.
   In November, 68 percent of those surveyed said they had
discussed AIDS with their children ages 10-17. That was up 5
percent from October, and up 8 percent from August, according to
the report, released Thursday by the center's parent agency, the
federal Centers for Disease Control.
   Also in November, 51 percent of the adults surveyed said their
kids had received AIDS instruction in school; that was up 6 percent
from October, and 15 percent from August.
   Throughout the surveys, about one-third of the adults questioned
did not know if their children had learned about acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in school.
   The center also reported that public awareness about AIDS
increased noticeably over the first four months of surveys.
   For example, in August, only 61 percent of the Americans
surveyed by the center believed it very unlikely or impossible to
get AIDS from shaking hands with a patient; in November, the
percentage had risen to 70.
   And only 53 percent of those surveyed in August believed it very
unlikely or impossible to get AIDS from working near someone who
has it; by November, it was up to 61 percent.
   AIDS experts say the disease is not spread through such casual
contact. AIDS, which had struck 57,024 Americans and killed 31,836
as of March 21, is spread most often through sex or shared drug
needles.
   The 3,333 adults questioned in November were not the same group
interviewed in previous months. The survey is designed with a
margin of error no more than 1 percent.

   A new non-profit group is saving old
computers from the scrap heap and shipping them to Third World
countries.
   ``Equipment which is outdated here is often state-of-the-art in
Africa, Asia and Latin America,'' said Phillip Friedman, executive
director of Global Technology Foundation.
   The group based in Boulder hopes to improve the quality of life
in the Third World, create new markets for advanced equipment and
provide tax breaks for donors of old computers.
   It has filed for tax-exempt status with the Internal Revenue
Service so corporations would be able to claim the book value of
donated equipment, while individuals could deduct fair market
value, Friedman said.
   The Philippines is targeted for a pilot project because a
distribution system is already established there through another
non-profit group, he said.
   ``We will focus on sending equipment into communities, rather
than government bureaucracies,'' Friedman said.
   More than $80,000 in equipment already has been donated,
officials said.

<TEXT>
   The research nuclear reactor at the center
of a debate over whether Taiwan has an atomic weapons program has
been closed temporarily, but not because of U.S. pressure, a top
government official said today.
   Liu Kuang-chi, secretary general of the government Atomic Energy
Council, told The Associated Press the reactor is being converted
to a system that no longer requires heavy water, which is used to
control the splitting of atomic nuclei.
   Local newspapers have reported the military-run Chungshan
Institute of Science and Technology shut down the reactor at Lung
Tan, 25 miles southwest of Taipei, after the U.S. government
suspended delivery of heavy water.
   The New York Times reported Wednesday that the Reagan
administration pressured Taiwan to close the reactor and stop work
on a secret installation that could have processed the reactor's
spent fuel to extract plutonium, a key component of nuclear weapons.
   ``The reactor was not closed because of U.S. pressure,'' Liu
said during a brief interview as he left a meeting with lawmakers.
He declined comment on the report of a secret installation to
process spent fuel.
   Liu said plans to convert the reactor are four years old and
designed to make the facility compatible with the island's three
nuclear power plants. He refused to elaborate.
   The reactor was closed in January for the remodification,
according to Liu, who would not say when the facility will restart.
   He said Taiwan reported the plans to the Vienna-based Atomic
Energy Agency last week. He refused to explain why the notification
was made two months after the closure.
   Chang Kuo-lung, professor of physics of the National Taiwan
University, said the remodification plan was uneconomical.
   ``This is like buying a car and replacing its engine with one
from another car,'' he said.
   Local newspapers, without disclosing their sources, have said
the U.S. government learned from Col. Chang Hsien-yi, former deputy
director of the institute's Nucleary Energy Research Center, that
Taiwan had plans to make nuclear weapons.
   Chang has been missing since January, and local newspapers have
claimed he is working for the CIA and living in the United States.
Taiwan officials say they do not know his whereabouts but are
investigating the case.
   Government officials have reiterated Taiwan's position that it
has not developed any nuclear weapons. Communist China has said
Taiwanese production of atomic weapons would be a reason for
invading the island, which Beijing views as a renegade province.
   Lawmaker Jaw Shau-kong of the ruling Nationalist Party today
asked the government to lodge the ``strongest protest'' to
Washington if the United States is found to be involved in Col.
Chang's disappearance.
   ``The United States can have nuclear weapons. Many other
countries have their nuclear weapons,'' Jaw said at the Legislative
Yuan, Taiwan's highest lawmaking body. ``We may not want to develop
nuclear weapons, but we cannot give up our high-technology research
work because of this.''
   Jaw said Taiwan ``can never tolerate the Central Intelligence
Agency to recruit one of our colonels and then get him to the
United States.''
   A day earlier, Jaw urged the government to ask the United States
to resume supplying heavy water so the Lung Tan reactor could
continue production of isotopes used in certain X-ray techniques,
cancer treatments and scientific research.

   Police arrested 23 people in connection with a
mob-controlled betting operation that netted $75 million a year
from wagers on college basketball, a spokesman said.
   Authorities seized two satellite dishes, 33 telephones, four
shotguns, a stolen handgun, ammunition and $25,000 in cash while
making arrests Thursday night in Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens,
said police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   The betting ring was controlled by the Genovese crime family,
O'Donnell said. He said police were not sure how long it had been
in operation.
   All 23 people arrested were charged with promoting gambling,
possession of gambling records and possession of gambling devices,
all felonies, the spokesman said.
   The arrests and seizures followed a six-week investigation
involving city police and state police from New York and New
Jersey, O'Donnell said.

   A Philadelphia teen-ager whose parents and
brothers were found slain in a bathtub was arrested by Tennessee
state troopers at a truck stop.
   Jose Enrique Hernandez, 17, was scheduled to appear today in a
detention and extradition hearing in Charlotte. Philadelphia police
were in Tennessee to escort him back to Pennsylvania to face four
counts of murder.
   Hernandez was arrested early Thursday at Reed's Truck Stop near
Interstate 40 after he had bought a cup of coffee.
   ``When he got out of the car, he looked real surprised to see
us. Then he looked like he made every attempt to act like he didn't
notice us. He kept his head down,'' Trooper Joel Deal said.
   Deal and Trooper Richard Austin checked the Honda's Pennsylvania
license plate number with the National Crime Information Center.
   ``It was kind of shocking,'' Deal said.
   The troopers found Hernandez was wanted in connection with the
deaths of his 4-year-old stepbrother, Frankie; 9-month-old
stepbrother, Jonathon; his father, Catalino Hernandez, 34; and
pregnant stepmother, Carmen Hernandez, 23.
   The bodies had been dead six days when Hernandez's aunt found
them in the family's apartment Monday. The bodies were stacked and
covered in a bathtub.
   Hernandez did not resist arrest and said nothing to the
troopers, Deal said. The youth slept as he was driven to the
Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center in Nashville.
   ``There was really no emotion from him at all,'' Deal said.
   Investigators searched the Honda for clues to the killings, but
nothing was found, Deal said.
   Officers have failed to find the .22-caliber handgun that killed
Hernandez's father and stepmother. Frankie was strangled with a
bandage and Jonathon was beaten to death with a blunt object,
possibly a baseball bat, police said.
   The killings followed an argument between Hernandez and his
father, police said.

   Police fears that a movie about Southern
California gangs might spark new violence when it is released next
month show how out of control the problem is, its director says.
   ``I live in a gang area. I live in Venice (Beach),'' Dennis
Hopper, director of ``Colors,'' said recently.
   The film, starring Robert Duvall and Sean Penn as policemen
fighting gang drug dealing and street crime, drew fire from real
law enforcement officers who were given a preview.
   The movie, scheduled for release in mid-April, features graphic
depictions of gang violence, including a gang drive-by shooting and
the killing of a police character by gang members.
   Several detectives said the film glamorizes the gang lifestyle
and could trigger violence among gang audiences. Assistant Police
Chief Robert Vernon suggested it be banned.
   Hopper, best known for his acting in such films as ``Easy
Rider,'' ``Apocalypse Now,'' ``Hoosiers,'' and ``Blue Velvet,''
said the official reaction shocked him.
   He said banning the movie would be ``like burning books ... And
they wanted to burn it before it could even be seen or read.''
   ``What they're basically saying is that they have a police
problem and they can't handle it,'' Hooper said. ``The gang thing
is out of control.''
   Hopper defended his use of real gang members as extras and the
realistic presentation of gang dominance in many Los Angeles
neighborhoods, using some statistics in the film to show what
police are up against.
   ``At the beginning we point out that there are 250 men and women
in law enforcement working against 600 gangs with over 70,000
members,'' he said. ``How can they possibly handle it?''

   Rep. Richard Gephardt predicted today that
his struggling presidential bid would be revitalized by a Michigan
victory and dismissed reports that he would opt to run for
re-election to the House if he loses here.
   ``I think we're going to turn this race back around here in
Michigan,'' Gephardt said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' show.
``We're going to get back in the middle of this thing and I'm going
to go ahead and win.''
   Asked why he was planning to file for re-election to his House
seat by Missouri's Tuesday deadline, Gephardt replied: ``No
decision on that at all. ... I'm going to be the nominee. I'm going
to be the next president.''
   But before a crowd of laid-off auto workers, enthusiastic about
his call for tough foreign trade policies, Gephardt on Thursday
acknowledged his presidential candidacy is in need of extraordinary
help from Michigan Democrats.
   ``This Saturday we're going to have a miracle in Michigan _ the
Michigan miracle,'' Gephardt said, mimicking Michael Dukakis and
his description of Massachusetts' economic turnaround during his
three interrupted terms as governor.
   Gephardt is running third in the polls in Michigan, behind
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson. After suffering major losses across the
South and elsewhere on Super Tuesday two weeks ago, Gephardt
launched a major effort to climb back into contention with the
Michigan contest.
   Aside from winning his home state of Missouri on Super Tuesday,
his only other victories have been in the South Dakota primary and
Iowa's lead-off caucus.
   Aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gephardt was
making plans to file for re-election to his House seat in Missouri
by the deadline Tuesday if Michigan does not give him the victory
he seeks.
   ``That's right. He will be out if doesn't win in Michigan,''
said a campaign aide who would not be quoted by name.
   Asked about the aide's comment, Gephardt said: ``No. I'm running
for president and I've doing very well here in Michigan. ... I'm
going to win in Michigan. I'm going to continue and do well.
   ``My mother always told me to cross one bridge at a time. That's
what I'm trying to do,'' he said.
   His wife Jane reinforced the notion that Michigan was a
do-or-die state for Gephardt.
   ``I think Dick has to come in first or a real strong second to
remain in the race, because at some point if you don't do well
here, it becomes difficult to raise money,''' she said. ``Dick's
message will be very popular in the industrial states, but if we
don't do well here, we will not be able to continue.''
   In Flint, Gephardt spoke in a roped-off street between a union
hall and the General Motors' Fisher Body assembly plant that GM
shut down last December, leaving an already reduced work force of
3,500 workers without jobs. The plant manufactured large,
rear-wheel drive GM autos.
   Many of the several hundred people present carried signs saying
they were unemployed auto workers. A billboard above the union hall
said, ``There is hope,'' and was signed by the UAW 581 Bible Group.
   ``While it may be cloudy and a little gloomy here today, what
we're going to do in 1988 is we're going to win an election for the
presidency and we're going to bring the sun back out in the
American economy,'' Gephardt said.
   He repeated his familiar call for tough trade sanctions against
countries that do not open markets to U.S. products, and resumed
his attack on Dukakis for changing positions on trade policy.
   He said he welcomed Dukakis' recently announced support for
Senate legislation that would toughen trade policies, and then
added: ``I just hope he doesn't change his trade policy again after
leaving Michigan.''

<HEAD>Mistakenly Towed Car Found in Junkyard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motorist whose car was mistakenly
towed from a service station searched frantically for three days
before he found his prized Chevy _ in a junkyard pile.
   ``It was squished, just like a little metal cube,'' John Geraca
said Thursday. ``All the wheels and the doors were gone. It was
about 20 inches high.''
   Geraca took his last ride in the 1975 Chevrolet Monte Carlo on
March 11, when he went to the service station to pick up the
Cadillac he had dropped off for a tuneup, police said.
   After paying the bill for the work, Geraca drove away in the
Cadillac and left his red Chevy behind in the parking lot,
intending to pick it up later, police said.
   But it was gone when he returned after two hours. Another red
Chevy, this one a 1976 Impala, was still in the parking lot,
however.
   The owner of that car had asked that it be junked, and no one at
the station noticed when the tow truck picked up the wrong car.
   ``I guess he just pulled up, hooked up on a Chevy and away he
went,'' said station attendant Richard Logan. ``He didn't ask
anybody about it.''
   Sam Parisi, owner of Southern Auto Parts junkyard, said it was
an honest mistake because the description of the two red Chevys was
identical.
   ``Right about now, they're probably making Toyotas out of it,''
said Parisi, one of four people arrested on racketeering and theft
charges last week at the culmination of a Fort Lauderdale and
Pompano Beach police investigation of suspected chop shops.
   ``We're completely honest here, and all we're trying to do is
make an honest buck,'' Parisi said. ``We don't steal cars.''
   Scrap cars fetch about $25 at a junkyard. Police said Geraca's
car was worth about $1,000.
   Investigators have told Geraca, who says the car held $16,000
worth of marine electronics equipment, that the case is a civil
matter, Coral Springs police Sgt. Jim Hanrahan said.

<TEXT>
   Rescue workers struggled through the night to
free victims trapped in the crushed cars of two passenger trains
that crashed head-on outside Shanghai, killing at least 28 people
and injuring 109.
   Chinese officials said today that 27 Japanese high school
students and one Chinese passenger died in Thursday's accident.
   A spokesman for the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office said by
telephone that 37 students from Gakugei High School in southern
Japan's Kochi prefecture and 72 Chinese passengers remained
hospitalized.
   Ten other Japanese from the 193-member school tour group were
treated for injuries and released, said Fu Yatao, a Foreign Affairs
spokesman.
   It was China's fourth fatal train collision this year, bringing
the total death toll to 169.
   Fu said the cause of the crash was still under investigation.
   Bundo Takagi, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Second
Consular Division, said a team of three Japanese doctors will leave
for Shanghai Saturday morning to assist in the treatment of injured
students.
   The school group arrived in China on March 21 for a tour of the
Shanghai area and the nearby city of Hangzhou.
   The crash occurred at 2 p.m. Thursday when train No. 311,
carrying the Japanese group, ignored a stop signal as it left
Shanghai station for Hangzhou and smashed into the southbound train
No. 208 arriving from Changsha, in the Shanghai suburb of Fengban.
   The Japanese group was traveling in the first-class cars in the
front of No. 311. The cars were knocked off the track along with
the baggage car of No. 208.
   Fu said the trains were not traveling at high speeds at the time
of the crash.
   Chinese officials responded last month to the string of
transportation disasters by demanding greater attention to safety.
China's railway minister was forced to resign to take
responsibility for three fatal train accidents in January.

<TEXT>
   Efforts to educate minorities about AIDS
have failed to stop the deadly disease because they have largely
ignored differing customs and languages, witnesses told a
presidential commission.
   Most black men with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in San
Francisco are homosexual or bisexual, yet have been nearly
untouched by efforts to halt the spread of the disease among white
gay men, said Amanda Houston-Hamilton, chairwoman of San
Francisco's Black Coalition on AIDS.
   ``We believe these men have fallen through the cracks,''
Houston-Hamilton told members of the Presidential Commission on the
Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic.
   ``They are dying alone, frequently coming for medical services
when they are too sick to walk, incontinent, demented,'' said
Houston-Hamilton, one of a panel of Asian, Hispanic, Native
American and hemophiliac leaders who testified Thursday as the
commission began a three-day visit here.
   ``There are 32 distinct Asian ethnic groups, with different
languages, cultures, traditions and customs. These differences have
been been largely overlooked by AIDS education programs,'' said
Davis Y. Ja, of the San Francisco-based Asian AIDS Project.
   The group represents the Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and
Vietnamese communities and runs the only Asian AIDS education
program in the nation with $230,000 in federal funds and a staff of
six.
   Lillis Stephens, of the Sacramento-based Hemophilia Council of
California, told the panel that of the state's 2,300 hemophiliacs,
at least 1,600 are infected with the virus, an infection level
exceeding that of gay and bisexual people in the state.
   An estimated 10 to 20 percent of sexual partners of infected
hemophiliac men infected are also infected with the AIDS virus,
according to surveys by the organization.
   Although the Centers for Disease Control estimate 53 cases of
AIDS among Native Americans nationally, Phil Tinsley, a community
leader, contended the number is much higher and will mushroom as a
result of a 20.8 percent teen-age pregnancy rate and the nation's
highest levels of drug abuse.
   John Wahl, a San Francisco gay activist and former co-chair of
the National Mobilization Against AIDS, told the commission it
should use its influence against those who claim the virus
justifies discrimination against homosexuals.
   ``The AIDS epidemic will not destroy our liberation movement,
but attempts to misuse the fear of AIDS to suppress us will be very
destructive to social peace,'' he said.
   The testimony will be considered by the full 14-member
commission, which is about two-thirds of the way through its
national tour. The commission will deliver its recommendations for
a national strategy to stop AIDS to the White House by June 24,
said spokesman Tom Brandt.

<HEAD>Acting Premier Calls For Reform At Annual Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting Premier Li Peng today told delegates to
the annual session of the National People's Congress that China
must emphasize reform as it continues on its path of economic
development.
   Li's report to the 2,970 delegates of China's legislature also
said that in the next five years, China will maintain its policies
of market-oriented reforms, opening itself to the outside world and
making its political system more democratic.
   Li, 59, is expected to be confirmed as head of government at the
legislative session, which will last 20 days. With his report, Li
displayed his full support, at least publicly, for the reforms set
in motion by his protege, senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   In the next five years, Li said, China must ``put reform at the
center of all our undertakings and integrate it more closely with
economic development so that the two are coordinated and promote
each other.''
   Veteran military leader Yang Shangkun, 81, an ally of Deng, is
likely to replace Li Xiannian, 79, in the largely ceremonial post
of president.
   Deng, 83, who entered semi-retirement last fall at a major
Communist Party meeting, sat on the podium between Li and Zhao
Ziyang, the former premier who now heads the Communist Party.
   The delegates also are expected to pass laws giving greater
authority to factory managers.
   Li, a Soviet-trained technocrat regarded as being cautious
toward reforms, also sounded several conservative themes on
economic problems in his speech, the keynote address of the
congress.
   Among those problems, he said, are rising prices, ``the
outstanding problem in our economic and social life today,''
inadequate investment on agriculture, and economic crimes committed
by those seeking personal gains.
   In the past five years, reforms have brought China an annual
growth rate of 11.1 percent, provided jobs for 37 million people,
substantially raised living standards and opened China to foreign
investment and trade, he said.
   Li outlined 10 objectives for the next five years, led by the
need for further reforms in agriculture. Chinese leaders have been
concerned about stagnating grain production as farmers switch to
more lucrative cash crops, and Li stressed that more money and
effort must be spent to ``mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for
agricultural production.''
   Li also stressed that China must revitalize its enterprises by
instituting contract systems for managers and reducing government
interference in factories. Heading the legislation to be passed at
the congress is an industrial enterprise law to guarantee the
rights of managers to operate their factories without interference.
   He hit hard on the problem of rising prices and said inflation
must be fought by reforming the irrational, heavily subsidized
pricing system and expanding supplies while controlling some prices.
   Officially, inflation was 7.3 percent last year, but prices in
most larger cities rose at double-digit rates.
   Li mentioned March 5 anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital
of Lhasa, saying the Buddhist monk-led demonstrators ``violated the
law and undermined the unity of the motherland. The rioters must be
severely punished.''
   Congress officials have promised that the session will be the
most open ever, with foreign journalists allowed to attend some of
the legislature's discussion groups as well as the opening and
closing sessions.
   Access to the discussions is part of the government attempt to
show the outside world that the congress, long belittled as a
rubber-stamp body for policies set by the party, has become more
democratic and influential.
   All major decisions are still made by the party Politburo and
its standing committee, but under outgoing congress chairman Peng
Zhen, 86, the body has gained some stature as a forum to debate,
and sometimes revise, policies handed down by the party.

   A federal prosecutor has alleged that
former Mayor Lee Alexander, sentenced 10 years in prison for
running a $1.5 million extortion-kickback scheme, did not surrender
all of his illegal profits.
   Alexander, one of the most visible U.S. mayors of the 1970s,
also was ordered to repay the city $100,000 in lieu of a $100,000
fine recommended by prosecutors.
   ``We're satisfied. It's what we requested and recommended and
what we felt was appropriate,'' U.S. Attorney Frederick J. Scullin
said after the sentencing Thursday.
   But Scullin said he still doesn't think Alexander has been
truthful about surrendering all his assets, as stipulated in the
plea bargain the former mayor made with the government Jan. 6.
   Alexander has turned over $1.4 million to the government, but
Scullin alleged during Thursday's hearing that Alexander is hiding
$200,000 and has lied about other kickbacks.
   Alexander, 60, who spent 16 years as mayor of New York's
fifth-largest city, had faced up to 30 years in prison for his
admission to charges of racketeering, conspiracy to obstruct a
government investigation and tax evasion. But U.S. District Judge
Thomas J. McAvoy followed the sentencing recommendation made by
prosecutors.
   ``I've brought great pain to my loved ones and the people of my
city and stand here now ready for my punishment,'' Alexander said
at the close of a 10-minute statement he gave before his sentence
was pronounced.
   ``The punishment you are about to impose on me ... pales against
the pain and remorse I feel.''
   Alexander was indicted July 16, 1987, by a special grand jury
empaneled 18 months earlier to investigate public corruption in
Syracuse.
   Alexander initially denied the charges. But he sought a plea
bargain after being faced with evidence the government had
gathered, including testimony from Alexander's bagmen and other
co-conspirators.
   He admitted running the extortion-kickback scheme during his
four terms as Syracuse mayor between 1970 and 1986. A 40-count
federal grand jury indictment charged that Alexander extorted
kickbacks of up to 25 percent from businessmen, professionals and
consultants doing work in the city.
   Alexander will be eligible for parole after about 40 months, but
Scullin said he believes Alexander will serve at least five years.
He must surrender by April 14.
   Also Thursday, seven co-conspirators were sentenced to terms
ranging up to 2{ years.

<HEAD>Mubarak Warns Against Israeli Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak has warned that an
Israeli attack on Saudi Arabia's new intermediate-range missile
launchers would ``blow up the entire peace process'' in the Middle
East.
   Mubarak said Thursday he had sent an urgent message to President
Reagan urging him to ``use his influence with Israel and urge it to
stop threatening Arab states in this irresponsible way.''
   He said he also sent a verbal message to Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir via Egypt's ambassador to Israel, Mohammed
Bassiouny. The Egyptian president said other senior Israeli
officials also had been contacted.
   Mubarak's remarks to local reporters was Egypt's second sharp
response to Israeli warnings about Saudi Arabia's Chinese-supplied
CSS-2 missiles.
   On Wednesday, an unidentified Egyptian official said Cairo would
consider any Israeli attack on the installations an attack on Egypt
itself.
   Mubarak's comments were distributed by the state-owned Middle
East News Agency.
   ``I warn against any attack on ... Saudi Arabia, which is a
sister and friendly country,'' Mubarak said. ``This is a grave,
grave matter. If an attack on Saudi Arabia occurred, it would blow
up the entire peace process.''
   Jordan and Syria also have said they would regard an Israeli
attack on Saudi Arabia as aggression against them.
   The Egyptian warning, however, appeared to carry greater weight
because of its 1979 peace treaty with Israel, the only one between
an Arab country and the Jewish state. Egypt also is the Arab
world's strongest military power.
   Saudi Arabia recently acquired the missiles, which have a range
of 2,200 miles, enough to reach Iran and Israel. The missiles are
capable of carrying nuclear warheads, but both China and Saudi
Arabia have given assurances they will be fitted only with
conventional warheads.
   After disclosure of the missile deal, Shamir was reported to
have told U.S. officials that the Saudis must get rid of them.
   On Sunday, Israeli Radio quoted close Shamir aide Yossi Ben
Aharon as referring to Israel's reputation not to let potential
dangers become actual ones, an apparent reference to Israel's 1981
air raid on a nuclear reactor being built in Iraq.
   Shamir said later that Ben Aharon denied making the statement,
but the premier said Tuesday that Israel and the United States were
``making efforts to deal with ... the grave development.''

   Two defense contractors and five executives
are facing charges of defrauding the Pentagon, one by faking test
results on electronics for a missile system, the other by selling
reconditioned aircraft parts as new.
   Consolidated Aeronautics Corp. of North Hollywood and its top
two officers were charged Thursday with one count of conspiracy and
four of submitting false claims about hydraulic parts provided
under a $1 million contract beginning in 1984.
   Another indictment accused Genisco Technology Corp. of Rancho
Dominguez and one current and two former executives of conspiracy
and falsely certifying that sensing devices used in air-to-ground
missiles and helicopters had been tested.
   ``Fraud in defense procurement and in the production of
strategic and military hardware is the No. 1 `white collar' crime
priority of the U.S. Attorney's office,'' said Gary Feess, chief
assistant U.S. attorney.
   The parts in the Consolidated contract were destined for use in
the steering systems of A-7, F-4 and F-104 jet fighters, the B-52
bomber and the C-141 transport plane.
   The hydraulic parts were certified by the company as new but
actually had been refurbished, the indictment alleged. All the
parts that have been tested failed, and flight crews could have
been endangered had the parts been used, officials said.
   Consolidated could be fined $3.5 million if convicted.
   Also charged were Gordon Strube, 65, of Beverly Hills,
Consolidated president and chief executive officer, and Ronald Guy,
42, of Granada Hills, vice president of sales.
   Telephone calls to the company went unanswered Thursday.
   If convicted, Strube could be sentenced to up to 7{ years in
prison and fined up to $1.25 million; Guy faces up to 15 years in
prison and a $750,000 fine.
   The Genisco contract was worth several hundred thousand dollars
a year, Feess said. Genisco faces a maximum $7.5 million fine.
   Genisco attorney Tom Holliday suggested that any wrongdoing was
the fault of officers and former officers of the company's
transducer products division in Simi Valley, and he called
indictment of the company unwarranted.
   Also charged were Werner Brinkschulte, 50, of Simi Valley,
former general manager of the division; Danny K. Evans, 34, of Simi
Valley, former division supervisor, and Robert L. Kersnick, 51, of
Sepulveda, quality assurance manager of the division.
   The three face up to five years in prison and fines of up to
$250,000 on each count.
   The transducers, the size and shape of small cigars, measure
pressure in liquid or gas. They are used to help guide the
High-Speed Anti-Radar Missile, which is fired from planes; to
measure oil pressure in the Coast Guard's HH-65A Dolphin
search-and-rescue helicopter, and to operate a Navy torpedo test
device.

<HEAD>One Year Later, Heidnik To Go To Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago today, police discovered three
half-naked women chained in a north Philadelphia basement and limbs
of another in the house's freezer.
   A grisly tale unfolded of how they were kept prisoners, one for
four months. The trail led to a New Jersey forest where the naked
body of another woman was found.
   The man who lived in the house, Gary Michael Heidnik, 41, faces
trial April 4 on rape and murder charges in a case that has already
attracted the attention of authors and could lead to a movie.
   Any profits from such a venture cannot go to Heidnik if he is
convicted, and at a federal bankruptcy court hearing Wednesday,
attorneys debated what should be done with the money.
   Heidnik's attorney, A. Charles Peruto Jr., said two-thirds of
the profits should be assigned to the estates of Heidnik and a sect
he started, United Church of the Ministers of God. If Heidnik were
convicted, the money would then go to his victims.
   Both Heidnik and the church are in bankruptcy.
   ``If I bring in money to enhance the estates, I get one-third of
what I enhance,'' Peruto said. ``The estates would get
two-thirds.'' As part of the agreement, the lawyer would not get
any legal fees for defending Heidnik.
   Assistant District Attorney Harriet Brumberg argued the state's
victim compensation law provides that 100 percent of such book or
movie profits goes to the victims.
   ``If anything in the book contains any thoughts, feelings,
impressions of Mr. Heidnik, that belongs to the victims,'' she said.
   At least two of the women are undergoing psychiatric treatment.
   Josephine Rivera, 27, a prostitute who police say was held by
Heidnik the longest _ four months _ and who escaped to notify
police, still is undergoing periodic counseling.
   Lisa Thomas, 20, another captive, continues to undergo weekly
psychiatric counseling.
   Cyril ``Tony'' Brown, Heidnik's retarded friend who is charged
with assisting him in the house, recently got married. Brown, 32,
who is free on bail and has been cooperating with police, on Nov.
13 married Gail Lincow, 37, a mildly retarded woman who had been a
friend and, police say, a temporary prisoner of Heidnik's.

   This U.S. Navy frigate found and
retrieved an armed power launch apparently abandoned by the
Iranians in the Strait of Hormuz.
   The craft, with a twin-barrel 25mm anti-aircraft gun mounted on
its bow and protected by a canvas, was brought alongside the USS
Reuben James in a tense, three-hour operation hampered by high seas
Thursday.
   The find could advance American knowledge of how the Iranians
operate in the Persian Gulf, Navy officials said. ``I'm not sure
what all this is going to lead to in the way of intelligence,''
said Cmdr. John J. Kieley III, skipper of the Reuben James. ``But I
think it will go a long way in helping us to understand the kind of
thing that goes on out here.''
   The captain repeatedly tried to approach the boat late Thursday
with his 443-foot frigate when it was found about 12 miles off the
coast of Oman at the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz. But seas up
to 10 feet and strong winds made maneuvering difficult, and the
Irananian boat disappeared into the darkness until it was relocated
two hours later.
   Two seamen was finally lowered onto the deck of the Iranian boat
from a helicopter hovering overhead.
   ``I was scared,'' said eight-year Navy veteran Tony Santos, 24,
of Bozeman, Mont., one of the lowered seamen. ``I didn't know what
to expect, whether it was booby trapped or whether to look for
someone lying down on the boat or what.''
   Lines were attached, and the Iranian craft was tied to the
frigate's stern for towing.
   Its rusty but functioning anti-aircraft gun had ammunition boxes
attached and was ready for firing. Spent shells littered the floor
of the boat, along with several sealed boxes of ammunition, cans of
diesel fuel and other items.
   The area where the ship was found is close to main shipping
lanes where tankers and other commercial vessels are frequently
attacked by Iran's naval frigates and armed patrol boats.

<DATELINE>EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suicides of three teen-age boys in
two weeks have shocked students and faculty at a high school here,
but they are trying to avert further tragedies with a vigorous
counseling program, including teen advisers.
   ``It's a scary situation,'' said Patty L. Kelly, 18, one of
several students receiving training as a peer group counselor at
Reitz High School after the suicides. ``Even people who didn't know
them are affected by it.''
   More than 600 parents and students attended a meeting at the
school auditorium Thursday night to talk about the deaths, the
latest of which occurred Wednesday morning.
   ``We're concerned about the families it happened to,'' said Judy
G. Elfreich, whose daughter is a freshman at Reitz. ``I'm not
really worried about more (suicides), but you just can't predict
things like that.''
   Along with the peer counseling groups, Reitz Principal Christine
Settle said the school would begin a ``buddy system'' to pair
newcomers with older students.
   In addition, six school psychologists and two counselors were
sent to the school of 1,350 students on Wednesday to assist the
four counselors normally assigned to Reitz.
   ``I hope all this helps,'' Miss Kelley said. ``People have come
to me to talk, but they're afraid to tell their parents because
they know they'll get sent to get help. And then they'll have to
come back (to school) and have people tell them, `Well, we know
you're crazy now.' So it's a lot easier for them to talk to us.''
   Vanderburgh County Sheriff Clarence C. Shepard told the audience
that an investigation had turned up no connection between the
deaths and satanism or cults, despite rumors to that effect.
   Shepard said before the meeting that ``all three were immediate,
personal, emotional problems with the young men. One was a
boyfriend-girlfriend problem, and the others were family problems.''
   The three victims were boys who knew each other and were in the
same year in high school, the sheriff said. Two were Reitz
sophomores, and the third was a former student who transferred to
another school.
   The latest victim, Larry E. ``J.J.'' Orth, 15, was found dead of
a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday. Orth left a
note indicating he was having family problems.
   Eric G. Sanders, 16 and also a Reitz student, died March 10; and
Steven R. Schaefer, 15, who left last year, died March 13. Both
Sanders and Schaefer also shot themselves.
   The school system began a weeklong spring vacation today, and
school officials hoped the break would help settle the students.
   ``They will still see their friends, but they won't be together
in one building and rumors won't be spreading as much,'' said Susan
G. McDowell, head of psychological services for the
Evansville-Vanderburgh School Corporation.
   ``We think that will help,'' she added.
   The suicide rate for those ages 15 to 24 more than doubled, from
5.2 per 100,000 in 1960 to 12.5 in 1984, according to the national
Center for Health Statistics.

   Red Army troops patrolled the tense Armenian
capital today to enforce a ban on public demonstrations by
Armenians locked in a violent territorial dispute with neighboring
Azerbaijan.
   The Kremlin took a series of decisive steps to quell the ethnic
violence, which has claimed more than 30 lives and posed a serious
challenge to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Soldiers and helicopters were deployed to Yerevan, the Armenian
capital, to prevent the kind of massive demonstrations staged by
Armenians to demand the return of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh
region that is now part of Azerbaijan.
   Demonstrations had been planned for Saturday, but Armenian
activists reported they had been called off.
   Armenian activists reported that authorities have ordered
disbanded an Armenian committee that spearheaded the drive to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.
   The government on Thursday announced an eight-year plan to build
more housing, roads, schools and social services in the disputed
region, where nearly 75 percent of the population of 160,000 is
Armenian.
   The Kremlin has accused the demonstrators of being extremists
and demanded an end to the Armenian protest actions as
``intolerable.'' The demonstrations led to retaliation aganst
Armenians in Azerbaijan, where at least 32 people were killed and
nearly 200 injured.
   Sources in Armenia told The Associated Press by telephone that
the atmosphere was tense, but they reported no outbreaks of
violence. Western reporters have not been allowed to visit the area.
   Hovik Vassilian, an activist in the protest, said the Armenian
Literary Gazette newspaper announced today that the committee to
annex Nagorno-Karabakh was being disbanded ``because it was working
against the people's interests.''
   Vassilian said the planned demonstrations Saturday ``won't
happen.'' He said they have been called off ``considering the
situation.''
   Armenians, who are predominantly Christian, have been demanding
that the Nagorno-Karabkh region, which is smaller than Delaware, be
annexed to the neighboring Armenian republic, though there is no
common border. Azerbaijan is overwhelmingly Moslem.
   The Kremlin plan for Nagorno-Karabkh also assures the local
population that television transmission will be upgraded so they
can receive broadcasts in Armenian as well as the national network
and Azeri programming.
   Other assurances, such as better supplies of Armenian-language
books and preservation of historical and cultural monuments,
address issues that incited Armenians to demand annexation for the
mountainous region, which has been part of Azerbaijan since 1923.
   In Azerbaijan, Radio Baku reported today that public assemblies,
meetings and street demonstrations will be allowed only by permits,
which must be applied for at least 10 days in advance. Those
violating the order face criminal penalties, according to the
broadcast monitored in London.
   Armenia instituted a similar ban on unsanctioned demonstrations
earlier in the week, according to Radio Yerevan.
   It was not immediately clear whether the government plan would
succeed in pacifying Armenians worried that Nagorno-Karabakh is
losing its ethnic identity. But one official source in Armenia
reported a generally quiet, though tense, atmosphere today.
   A duty officer at the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs,
responsible for police operations, told The Associated Press by
telephone from Yerevan that the city was ``fairly quiet.''
   The officer, who declined to give his name or detailed
information, confirmed Red Army helicopters and security troops
were patrolling the capital to keep order.
   Calls to Azerbaijan did not go through today.
   Moscow-based dissidents reported Thursday that the atmosphere in
Armenia was ``filled with tension.''
   On Wednesday, the Soviet government rejected as ``intolerable''
the Armenian campaign for annexation, indicating it would not bend
to pressure brought on by mass demonstrations and strikes in the
republic last month.
   The unrest brought an unusual personal appeal from Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for calm and reason in dealing with the ethnic
dispute. Gorbachev also promised the leadership would review
Armenia's claims to Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Gorbachev's address calmed the demonstrators in Yerevan. But on
Feb. 28, ethnic extremists went on a rampage of murder, rape,
robbery and other crimes in the Azeri city of Sumgait.

<HEAD>West Virginia Town Selected For $4 Million Cardiovascular Health
Study</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WELLSBURG, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This small, Ohio River town has been
chosen as the focus of a $4 million, two-year, privately funded
study aimed at reducing heart attacks, strokes and high blood
pressure, officials said.
   Sponsors of the pilot program said they chose Wellsburg because
of its small population _ 4,000 _ and because West Virginia
registered the highest obesity rate in the country at 24 percent in
a 1986 federal study that also found 31 percent of West Virginians
smoke cigarettes.
   West Virginia trails only Iowa in the annual death rate from
heart disease, according to state Health Director Dr. David
Heydinger.
   ``Education, especially health education, is lacking in West
Virginia,'' said John W. Bertram, administrator for the Brooke
County Health Department and a member of the program's advisory
board.
   The program, one of the first privately funded public health
education programs aimed at rural areas, is sponsored by The Bayer
Co., an aspirin and over-the-counter drug manufacturer, and
Glenbrook Laboratories, Bayer's New York-based parent.
   However, aspirin, recently linked to the prevention of heart
attacks and strokes, will not be part of the program, said Robin D.
Mills, president of the Bayer Co.
   ``We already have ongoing research into that,'' Mills said.
``What we want to develop is a health program that we can offer to
rural Americans.''
   The program will begin in May when 1,000 volunteers will be
checked for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and
other cardiovascular risk factors.
   Participants must be at least 21 years old and willing to return
for checkups every three months over a two-year period.
   Health professionals will attempt to lower the weight,
cholesterol and blood pressure of participants and eliminate other
risk factors through education and behavior modification.
   Some aspects of the study, including nutrition seminars, weight
reduction techniques and smoking clinics will be available to all
of the town's 4,000 people, Mills said.
   The company will also sponsor walks, runs and other exercise
activities for the town, which is about 40 miles southwest of
Pittsburgh.
   ``If people listen, it will be a good thing,'' said Nora
Hartley, 46, owner of Nora's Novelty Nook, as she smothered a
cigarette in a full ashtray.
   ``I'd go crazy if I had to quit smoking and I don't have to lose
weight, but I'll probably check it out,'' she said.
   Cardiovascular disease _ the leading cause of death in the
United States _ kills nearly a million Americans each year,
according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Nearly
one-fifth of those deaths occur in people under the age of 65.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers fired on
Palestinian demonstrators who hurled rocks and broken bottles in
the occupied West Bank today, killing two and wounding six,
hospital officials and witnesses said.
   The army said five protesters were wounded in the attack on a
makeshift army headquarters in Tarqumia and in a clash in the
nearby city of Hebron. It said it was investigating the reports
that two were killed.
   Officials close to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir protested a
meeting planned Saturday between Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and two Palestinian-Americans tied to the PLO.
   As part of a campaign to crack down on leaders of recent unrest,
the army arrested a prominent Gaza lawyer under special laws
allowing detention for up to six months without trial.
   Israel radio quoted an unidentified military source as saying
the military had evidence that the attorney, Raji Sourani, was
linked to the organization of the uprising. The army has not
commented.
   More than 4,000 Palestinians have been detained since the unrest
began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and 3,000
remain in jail. But unlike previous roundups, which focused on
stone-throwers, the current one has zeroed in on the underground
leadership.
   In Tarqumia, a village of 9,000 near Hebron, hundreds of
stone-throwing youths set out before dawn to attack a school that
troops had turned into makeshift headquarters, said Naim Odeh, a
52-year-old schoolteacher.
   ``The troops came into the village at 4 a.m. and took over the
school,'' Odeh said. ``Then about 500 youths marched out to the
school and started throwing rocks and broken bottles.''
   Troops responded by opening fire, Odeh said, and the
confrontation lasted several hours. He said two youths were shot
and killed.
   Villagers and an official at Hebron's Alia hospital identified
the dead as Khaled Hassan Ahmed Murktan, 18, who was shot in the
stomach, and Walid Abdul Fatatta, 18, who was shot in the chest.
   Odeh said the bodies were buried in the town's cemetery. There,
villagers pointed out to a journalist two freshly dug mounds of
earth, with an inscribed rock beside them.
   In Hebron, soldiers surrounded Al Haras mosque following noon
prayers on the Moslem Sabbath when 20 youths took up positions on
the roof and began throwing stones and waving a Palestinian flag,
which is outlawed in Israel.
   As a reporter watched from a nearby vantage point, troops fired
tear gas and the sound of shots also could be heard.
   Three protesters were shot and critically wounded, the
Arab-owned Palestine Press Service said.
   Later, three Arab teen-agers were seen sitting on the ground
with their hands tied behind their backs. A soldier was seen
kicking one of the young men, who was wearing a blue sweater.
   The army said an empty passenger bus headed for the Jewish
settlement of Qiryat Arba near Hebron was surrounded by residents
of an Arab village, who beat the driver and set the vehicle on fire.
   Israel radio said the driver was hospitalized with two broken
arms.
   Israeli officials reacted angrily to Shultz's plans to meet with
two Palestinian-American members of the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   The officials said the meeting violated a U.S. commitment not to
talk to the Palestine Liberation Organizaton.
   Edward Said, a professor at Columbia University in New York, and
Ibrahim Abu Lughod, a professor at Northwestern University in
Chicago, were to discuss the latest American peace initiative with
Shultz.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Shamir, said the prime minister
planned to raise the issue today with U.S. Ambassdor Thomas
Pickering.
   Ehud Olmert, a senior legislator from Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc, said he was ``very upset about this because they are not just
Americans; they are members of a group the U.S. government has
promised not to talk to.''
   Israel refuses to deal with the PLO, which it views as a
terrorist group. The Palestinian death toll in the violence is 109,
according to U.N. figures. One Israeli soldier has been killed.

   In the heady days following his Southern
victories, Democratic presidential candidate Albert Gore Jr.
depicted rival Michael Dukakis as having the electoral appeal of
George McGovern and Walter Mondale.
   Two weeks later, the harsh rhetoric is gone. With recent polls
showing Dukakis _ not Gore _ as the only Democrat running even
nationwide with GOP front-runner George Bush, Gore is having a more
difficult time pinning his rival with the image of the Democrats'
landslide losers of 1972 and 1984.
   Gore, the Tennessee senator who needs a victory in the North to
remain a top contender, has hardly mentioned Dukakis, Jesse Jackson
or his other rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination as
he campaigns in Michigan and Wisconsin. Instead, he is focusing on
Bush and the Reagan administration in a slight retooling of his new
populist message.
   His silence on Dukakis has caused some to speculate about Gore's
intentions _ whether he is holding his fire against a candidate who
could, as nominee, offer him the second spot on the ticket. Gore
maintains he has ``no interest'' in the vice presidential
nomination _ a statement that stops short of ruling it out.
   There are also suggestions Gore may be awaiting a better
opportunity to engage Dukakis, when the field has narrowed and Gore
can find a state where he does not speak from a position so far
behind Dukakis that his remarks seem born of desperation.
   Gore catapulted to the top tier of Democratic presidential
contenders through his victories in the South and West on Super
Tuesday, March 8. Two days after that, campaigning in Chicago
toward Illinois' primary, Gore delivered a strong assault on
Dukakis as representing the Democrats' past losing formula.
   ``For those who want another election blow-out, and see the
Democratic Party losing 49 out of 50 states, vote for Michael
Dukakis,'' Gore said then.
   ``How long will it take for us to learn the approach that
Michael Dukakis represents does not sell to the American people?''
he asked.
   Campaigning this week across Michigan's sparsely populated Upper
Peninsula, Gore was asked why he is not continuing that language,
and did he no longer think Dukakis would be a ``blow-out'' loser.
   ``I said that the approach he represents runs that risk,'' Gore
responded. ``I'm not going to say any of my opponents are not
electable.
   ``I think the recent history suggests there are only two kinds
of elections in modern history _ Republican landslides or
Democratic squeakers. This is going to be a Democratic squeaker.''
   When he was pinning his hopes on appeal among the South's
independent and conservative-minded Democrats, Gore argued that he
is the most electable Democrat.
   Two polls this week _ one by CBS News and The New York Times,
the other by The Washington Post and ABC _ both showed Dukakis and
Bush in a virtual dead heat. Gore, meanwhile, was far behind Bush
when paired against the likely GOP nominee.
   Gore now refers to the ``electability'' issue as one of
importance primarily to the Democratic ``super delegates,'' the
nearly 650 elected officials who will get delegate berths and be
free agents at the convention, unbound by primary or caucus results
in their states.
   He still contends he has demonstrated an appeal to swing voters
that Dukakis and Jackson have not. But he usually couples it with
an acknowledgement that it is more an issue for party insiders than
average voters.
   ``Many Democrats, particularly the so-called super delegates,
are interested in finding a candidate who has the best chance of
winning in the fall, the best chance of appealing to the
independently thinking voters who hold the balance of power, the
best chance of carrying areas like the South, West and Midwest,
where we have lost overwhelmingly these last several elections,''
Gore said.
   ``I think it's a legitimate question to ask _ who can best win.''
   Gore disputed the answer presented in the recent polls, saying
it is too early to measure such sentiment accurately.
   ``Hypothetical matchups of that kind ... are entirely
meaningless,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Socialist Labor leader Joe Bossano, a staunch
defender of independence for this British colony, was declared the
victor today in local elections.
   Bossano, who rejects a competing Spanish claim of sovereignty
over the fortress colony at its southern tip, received 8,128 votes,
or 58 percent of the votes cast Thursday.
   Incumbent Chief Minister Adolfo Canepa was next with 4,442
votes, or 29 percent, in the most lopsided victory ever by a
Gibraltar party.
   The incumbent leads the Advancement of Civil Rights party, which
had long dominated Gibraltar politics.
   The party of Bossano, branch officer of the 7,000-member
Transport Workers General Union, won eight seats in the 15-seat
House of Assembly. Canepa's party won the other seven.
   The conservative Independent Democratic Party led by former
civil servant Joe Pitaluga got 13 percent of the vote, but none of
its candidates won enough votes to gain a seat.
   In his first comments to reporters after the victory, Bossano
asserted that most of Gibraltar's 29,000 residents reject a 1984
British-Spanish accord known as the Brussels agreement. Under that
accord, Britain for the first time said it would discuss the
question of sovereignty with Spain.
   Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht
following its defeat in the War of Succession. The treaty
stipulates that Spain recover sovereignty over the territory if
Britain relinquishes it.
   Canepa is a protege of longtime party leader and Gibraltar Chief
Minister Joshua Hassan, who governed the colony for 40 of the last
43 years.
   In campaigning for Canepa, Hassan accused Bossano of being a
radical who would harm Gibraltar's relations with Britain and
Spain. But Bossano said he intended to better relations with both
countries.
   Presiding senior election officer Eugene Howes said 13,473 votes
were cast, representing just over 76 percent of the colony's 17,500
registered voters. The highest previous turnout had been 74 percent
in 1984 elections.

   Iran said today it hammered Iraq's
southern port of Basra with missiles and shellfire and repulsed an
Iraqi counterattack in the northern Kurdistan mountains, killing or
wounding 500 men.
   Both sides claimed to have shot down four jets, and Iraq claimed
it attacked two ships off Iran's coast in the Persian Gulf.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Revolutionary
Guards in northeast Iraq pushed back four infantry battalions and a
brigade _ about 7,200 troops _ that Iraq moved up from its southern
7th Army Corps to reinforce the northern front.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the fighting centered
around the Rishan mountains east of the town of Sayyid Sadiq.
   Iranian forces, estimated at around 30,000 men, were reported
Thursday to be five miles east of the town, a strategic transport
hub, after punching 10 miles into Iraq in an offensive launched
March 16.
   Tehran Radio reported four Iraqi fighter-bombers were shot down
by ground fire today and the pilots killed.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said four
U.S.-built Iranian F-5 jets were shot down by Iraqi anti-aircraft
fire over the battle zone.
   It said Iraqi fighters destroyed four Iranian helicopters on the
ground. IRNA, quoting military communiques, said Iranian jets
carried out 14 attacks on Iraqi troop concentrations in the
northeastern battle zone and around al-Amarah in the south. It said
all the planes returned safely to their bases.
   Baghdad's al-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Arab
Baath Socialist Party, said Iraq's air force flew 224 combat
missions Thursday.
   That was one of the highest one-day totals in the last year and
underlined the growing intensity of the current fighting. The
newspaper said the planes dropped nearly 200 tons of bombs and
destroyed three Iranian jets and two helicopters.
   IRNA said six missiles were fired during the night into the
strategically important city of Basra and the border town of
Mandali, 80 miles east of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
   The agency said long-range artillery also pounded ``military,
economic and industrial centers'' in Basra and the border town of
al-Gharbi farther north.
   There was no immediate word on casualties. In recent weeks,
hundreds of civilians on both sides have been killed or wounded in
missile, air and artillery attacks in the so-called ``war of the
cities.''
   The Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi fighter-bombers attacked two
``large maritime targets,'' which usually means tankers, off the
Iranian coast during the night. It reported ``accurate and
effective hits.''
   There was no immediate independent confirmation of the ship
attacks.
   Iraq said 13 people were killed and 68 wounded Thursday when two
Iranian missile crashed into downtown Baghdad.
   Among the victims was a woman, killed in a hospital bed while
breast-feeding her newborn baby, INA reported. The infant was found
alive in his mother's arms several hours later.
   Iraq said it fired six long-range missiles into Tehran, a city
of 6 million. IRNA said 10 civilians were killed and 100 wounded
when the missiles hit two schools, two mosques and two hospitals as
well as shops and houses.
   Both sides have fired more than 250 missiles into each other's
cities since Feb. 29, when Tehran was hit by long-range Iraqi
missiles for the first time in the war.
   Iran said Thursday that its troops advanced further into Iraq's
northeastern Kurdistan province. It claims to have killed or
wounded 11,000 Iraqis, captured 4,500 and destroyed 200 tanks and
armored vehicles in the 10-day offensive. Iraq claims it has killed
thousands of the invaders but has admitted losing several towns.
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei, meanwhile, intensified a
propaganda campaign against Iraq for allegedly dropping chemical
bombs on three towns captured by the Iranians.
   IRNA quoted Khamenei Thursday night as calling on international
organizations, including the United Nations, to expel Iraq for
using chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 Geneva agreement.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani earlier in the day that
Iran may use chemical weapons itself unless the United Nations
takes action against Iraq.

<TEXT>
   An American soldier has been
convicted of smuggling more than 37 pounds of cocaine into Puerto
Rico from Panama aboard a military transport plane.
   The soldier, Pvt. 1st Class Bruce Maurice Mack, 20, of Gary,
Ind., was arrested Jan. 30 along with three others upon arrival at
the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on the east coast of this U.S.
commonwealth.
   A 12-member jury deliberated 2{ hours before convicting Mack on
Thursday of three counts of importing and possessing cocaine with
the intent to distribute.
   U.S. District Court Judge Hector Laffitte set sentencing for
June 16. Mack faces terms ranging from 10 years to life.
   Mack testifed Wednesday he had nothing to do with the others
arrested on drug charges and denied two drug-filled duffel bags
were his.
   The others detained Jan. 30 were U.S. soldiers Darrin Taylor,
19, of Chicago, Ill., and Franklyn Milton Browne, 19, of the New
York City borough of Queens, and Rafael A. Valladares, 29, a
Panamanian civilian dressed as a U.S. soldier who was carrying
false military documents.
   Officials said Mack and Valladares were working independently of
each other and of the others. Partially sealed indictments alleged
Taylor and Browne were working together with four other people,
including two arrested in Ft. Worth, Texas, who were to receive the
drugs.
   Another U.S. soldier working with the group, Richard Mark
Williams, was brought to Puerto Rico from Panama last month and
charged with smuggling and possession with intent to distribute 17
pounds of cocaine.
   The cocaine was found in a routine customs check during a
refueling stop on a flight from Howard Air Force Base in Panama.

Risk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Women who began taking birth-control pills as
teen-agers and used oral contraceptives over several years do not
face an increased, long-term risk of breast cancer, according to a
study published today.
   Previous studies have disagreed over whether the use of
birth-control pills increases the risk of breast cancer for women
through middle age. Some researchers have suggested the conflicting
conclusions might be the result of a long-term latent effect from
early use.
   ``But we found no direct human evidence for such a latent
effect,'' said Dr. Bruce Stadel, one of four authors reporting on
the study of more than 9,000 women in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Early and prolonged use of birth-control pills was defined as
using oral contraceptives for at least six years before the age of
25, according to Stadel and his colleagues, who were from the
Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences at Bethesda,
Md.
   Researchers collected case histories and interviewed 4,714 women
through age 54 who developed breast cancer, then matched them with
a control group of 4,540, breaking the subjects into comparable
sub-groups depending on how long they had used oral contraceptives.
   ``This was a very, very large study ... and these data are
immensely reassuring,'' said Stadel who was at the National
Institutes of Health when the study was conducted and now is with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Bethesda, Md.
   The study also gave reassurances about different dosages in
birth-control pills, Stadel said today on CBS' ``This Morning''
show.
   ``The work you're seeing in this paper reflects the experience
of birth control pill use during the 1960s up through the mid '70s,
when doses tended to be higher than they are now,'' he said. ``The
fact that we find no increased risk from that type of pill use, has
implications that the lower dose should not be even that much
concern.''
   Despite the results of the study, Stadel said researchers
believe additional large studies should be conducted in the 1990s,
``when the women we interviewed will be in their mid-60s.''
   ``More than 50 million women around the world are on the pill
and the cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer is about one in
10. When you consider those two things together, you can understand
why we'd want someone to take another look,'' Stadel said.

   Striking unions representing people who perform
in commercials have agreed to meet with a federal mediator in two
weeks, while fallout from the scriptwriters' walkout builds in the
television industry.
   Television production companies said they have laid off more
than 1,000 people because of the writers' strike, costing workers
more than $4 million in salaries and benefits.
   Union actors who appear in radio or television commercials
walked off the sets March 21 in a dispute over payments from ads
run on cable television.
   But Thursday, negotiators for the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists agreed to meet
with advertisers and a federal mediator in New York City on April 6.
   Performers' unions and representatives for the American
Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National
Advertisers said no preconditions were attached to the planned
talks.
   The Writers Guild of America went on strike March 7 when talks
broke down with producers over rerun payments and creative control
on the set. No new talks are scheduled, and representatives from
both sides expect a long strike.
   About 125 writers and producers have had to suspend TV
development deals at a cost to them of about $1.5 million a week,
according to the Alliance of Movie and Television Producers.
   Some prime-time TV shows ended production early when scripts ran
out, and several projects in the works had to be shelved. Talk
shows like Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show'' and ``Late Night With
David Letterman'' are broadcasting reruns until the strike is
settled.
   SAG and AFTRA represent more than 100,000 actors and announcers
working on commercials, while the WGA represents more than 9,000
script writers coast to coast.

<HEAD>Terrorist Suspect Released for Insufficient Evidence, Source Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigating magistrate has released a Lebanese
man held in a series of Paris bombings because of insufficient
evidence, a well-informed source said today.
   Mohamed Mouhajer, who was arrested last March in a police sweep,
was freed Thursday by magistrate Gilles Boulouque, according to a
source in the magistrate's office. Seven Tunisians also were
arrested in the sweep.
   Mouhajer was released ``because there was not sufficient
evidence to keep him in temporary detention'' any longer, according
to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Boulouque has been in charge of investigating a series of Paris
bombings in 1985 and 1986 that left 13 people dead and 250 injured.
   French authorities have said Mouhajer, a former philosophy
student at the Sorbonne, was an ideologist for the Committee for
Solidarity with Arab and Middle East Political Prisoners, a group
which claimed responsiblity for five of the violent attacks.
   The source said Mouhajer was held while police investigated his
relationship with Fouad Ali Saleh, a Tunisian immigrant described
by authorities at the time of his arrest as the leader of a
pro-Iranian terrorist network. Saleh has been charged in several of
the bombings, including a Sept. 17, 1986, attack at the Tati
department store that killed six people and injured 51 others.
   Mouhajer still faces charges of criminal association and illegal
possession of arms and has been forbidden to leave the country.
Neither charge is related to the terrorist bombings, the source
said.
   A French newspaper today implied that Mouhajer's release might
be connected to Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac's hopes for the
upcoming presidential election. Four Frenchmen are missing and
believed to be held captive in Lebanon.
   The daily Liberation said, ``In this electoral period, Jacques
Chirac would not be displeased with the release of some French
hostages in Lebanon.''
   Earlier this week, Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet, national secretary
of Chirac's party, the Rally for the Republic, visited Damascus
where he met with a number of Syrian officials.
   Syria is the main powerbroker in Lebanon and maintains troops in
west Beirut.
   On his return to Paris, Kosciusko-Morizet told the French news
agency Agence France-Presse that the meetings were not related to
the French hostages in Lebanon.
   In all 22 foreigners are missing and believed to be held captive
in Lebanon. The longest held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   A robbery suspect who lived in a cave was
lured into custody with promises of cigarettes and a hot meal,
police said.
   The man who allegedly put the suspect in a cave was later
arrested as well, and apparently tried to commit suicide, police
said.
   Joseph E. Steffani, 24, had long, dirty hair and apparently had
not shaved for at least a week when he was arrested Wednesday night
for investigation of robbery, according to Sgt. Dan Mercado.
   He said Steffani was addicted to tranquilizers and was put in
the cave by Kenneth Hawtin, 37, of El Cerrito, who was arrested
Thursday.
   In what police say may have been a suicide attempt, Hawtin
jammed a key into an electrical outlet at a police station and was
knocked unconscious. He was taken to a hospital and booked for
investigation of robbery.
   Steffani was held at the Oakland City Jail.
   Steffani, who told officers he had been addicted to
tranquilizers since he was was 14, admitted at least 15 robberies
in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, Mercado said.
   Police said Steffani had lived with Hawtin until last week, when
Hawtin took him to the cave in the hills above the community of
Canyon.
   Steffani has a history of emotional problems and ``was afraid to
be around people,'' Mercado said.
   Hawtin and a few other friends knew of Steffani's hiding place,
Mercado said. They would drive to the area with food and other
supplies, and honk to let Steffani know they were there.
   When the two undercover officers following a tip drove to the
area Wednesday night and honked, all they could see at first was
``eyes in the bushes,'' Mercado said.

   More than 1,000 Vietnam veterans
involved in the spraying of the herbicide Agent Orange show no
unusual health problems to date, according to updated results of a
government study.
   In a statement Thursday, U.S. Air Force medical officials called
``reassuring'' the findings that the chemical defoliant hasn't
caused disease in Vietnam veterans, but warned that the results
weren't conclusive.
   ``This is the definitive study on Agent Orange in Vietnam
veterans, and so far it shows that disease is not related to
apparent exposure, that there is no increased incidence of major
long-term health effects,'' Dr. William Wolfe, senior investigator
in the government's 20-year Agent Orange probe, was quoted as
saying in the statement.
   ``These results are reassuring,'' said Wolfe, chief of
epidemiology at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at
Brooks Air Force Base in Texas.
   The findings reflect the latest tests of 2,309 veterans in the
government's investigation into Agent Orange and its impact on
soldiers who handled the dioxin-containing herbicide. The study
will conclude in 2002.
   Some Vietnam veterans are seeking compensation for ailments they
say are tied to exposure to the toxic chemical.
   ``No matter how good this study is, it will never lay to rest
the issue for people who argue they were hurt,'' said Dr. Arnold
Gass, head of the Agent Orange registry operation at the La Jolla
Veterans Administration Medical Center.
   He said the study is scientifically sound but handicapped by its
focus on Operation Ranch Hand, Air Force servicemen involved in
handling and dropping the herbicide from aircraft.
   ``It doesn't answer the question about what happened to the man
in the field,'' he said. ``The Ranch Handers flew in, flew out. The
men in the field were there for days. They didn't take showers.''
   Ranch Handers are used because they are assumed by the
government to have had the greatest amount of exposure to the
chemical.
   The study, begun in 1982 and conducted for the past four years
at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, examined
1,016 men involved in Operation Ranch Hand and 1,293 Air Force
veterans not involved in the operation.
   Scripps Clinic physicians assessed each participant for general
health, malignancy, and the neurological, psychological,
gastrointestinal, dermatological, cardiovascular, hematological,
renal, endocrine, immunological, pulmonary and nervous systems.
   ``These examinations found no evidence of a relationship between
Agent Orange exposure and adverse health,'' the statement said.
   ``A number of minor medical differences were seen but they
appear to be unrelated to exposure to dioxin. They will be
monitored and re-evaluated during the next scheduled examinations
in 1992.''
   Last year, a Veterans Administration study found increased
deaths due to lung cancer and certain lymph cancers among Vietnam
veteran Marines, providing what veterans' groups called the first
clear scientific data implicating Agent Orange.
   The Scripps Clinic statement cautioned that the latest results
are not conclusive because the study used estimated levels of
herbicide exposure based roughly on amount of contact, not by
actual bloodstream dioxin levels.
   Scientists have recently discovered a way to detect dioxin
levels in blood even years after exposure. Analysis of blood
samples from 2,010 veterans is expected to be completed within two
years.
   Thursday's findings were released three days after an Air Force
report admitted that an often-cited 1984 government study had been
flawed because it didn't make clear that it couldn't exonerate the
chemical from veterans' health problems.

   An attacker shot and wounded the captain of
an Italian jetliner today after the plane landed at Bombay's
airport and tossed two grenades at pursuers before he was captured,
authorities said.
   The assailant fired four shots from an automatic pistol at
Vittorino Sanataniello, who had landed the Alitalia airliner a few
minutes earlier after a flight from Australia. Police said
Sanataniello and 12 other crew members were climbing onto an
airport bus bound for a city hotel when they were attacked.
   Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
attacker, identified as Abbas Mohammed Ali Shahadi, was believed to
be a member of the Abu Nidal Palestinian terrorist group. They said
he apparently had intended to attack a French airline crew.
   An Air France flight was due to land at Bombay about 40 minutes
after the Alitalia plane set down. The sources said police had
received warnings of a possible attack on Air France targets.
   Abu Nidal is the pseudonym of Sabri Al-Banna, who broke with
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974. His
group has since claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks around
the world aimed at Israel and other targets.
   The attacker was overpowered by two off-duty policemen who
chased him as he fled the bus, said Police Commissioner Vasant
Saraf. The two grenades he lobbed failed to explode.
   Sharaf said a second attacker may have escaped in the confusion.
   The captain was hurt in the thigh and waist, but his life wasn't
in danger, said an Alitalia official in Bombay.
   The police sources discounted early reports that Shahadi, 35,
was Iranian. They said he claimed to be a Lebanese national but
carried no travel documents. He appeared in court today and was
being held in a Bombay jail.
   Initial reports described the attack as an attempted hijacking,
but police later discounted that theory because the crew had
already left the airplane and passed through the airport terminal.
   Police were investigating whether the attack was linked to the
discovery of unexploded grenades in the visitors' lounge of the
Saudi Arabian Consulate Wednesday in Bombay.
   Hundreds of police converged on the airport and Saraf ordered a
red alert throughout Bombay, sealing city exits. Foreign consulates
and airline offices in Bombay were asked to increase security.
   At the airport, visitors were banned and security strengthened
with the deployment of reserve police.
   Shahadi was being interrogated by police for motives in the
attack, the police commissioner said. Police seized a handbag,
which contained clothes and two loaded magazines.
   The airplane had landed at Bombay after a flight from Sydney
with stops at Melbourne and Singapore. It left Bombay about two
hours after the shooting and was bound for Rome.

   A U.N. relief agency today appealed to
the kidnappers of British journalist Alec Collett to free him on
the third anniversary of his abduction.
   Collett, a New York-based journalist, was kidnapped in Beirut's
Moslem sector on March 25, 1985 while on assignment for the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency.
   A group calling itself the Revolutionary Organization of
Socialist Moslems claimed responsibility. The group is believed to
be linked to the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a radical Palestinian
faction led by Abu Nidal.
   ``We call on those who unjustifiably kidnapped the innocent Alec
Collett to let him return to his family immediately,'' said Per
Olof Hallqvist of Sweden, director of UNRWA in Lebanon.
   ``Our recent experience of the kidnapping of William Jorgensen
and Jan Stening has reminded us about the inhuman horrors and
anxieties which the families of the kidnap victims have to go
through,'' Hallqvist said in the English-language statement.
   Stening, 44, a Swede, and Jorgensen, 58, a Norwegian, were
kidnapped by Palestinians near the southern port city of Sidon on
Feb. 5. Both worked for UNRWA. They were released March 1 after
UNRWA, which takes care of Palestinian refugees, threatened to cut
its services in Lebanon.
   Collett's kidnappers have demanded the release of three Fatah
Revolutionary Council members imprisoned in Britain for the
attempted 1985 assassination of Israel's ambassador to London at
that time, Shlomo Argov.
   The kidnappers claimed April 23, 1986, that they had killed
Collett,66, in retaliation for British support for U.S. air raids
on Libya several days earlier.
   The group later issued a videotape showing a body it said was
Collett's hanging from a makeshift scaffold. But Collett's body has
never been found.
   In all, 22 foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. The longest-held foreign captive is Terry Anderson, 40,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped in west Beirut March 16, 1985. The pro-Iranian Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, claims to hold him.

   A passenger train today struck a bus
carrying nursery school pupils home for the Easter holidays,
killing 15 people, including 10 children, a government spokesman
said.
   The victims included six boys and four girls, said Francisco
Castillo, a spokesman for Lerida province. The bus driver and four
teachers also were killed, he said.
   Eighteen children were injured, four of them seriously. The
children, who attended the Los Angeles nursery school in Juneda,
were between the ages of 1 and 6.
   The accident occurred at a rail crossing between the towns of
Juneda and Puigvert, 11 miles southeast of the city of Lerida in
northeastern Spain.
   The state-owned railway RENFE said the bus driver apparently
ignored a clearly marked stop sign and moved to go over the rail
crossing at the same time a RENFE passenger train passed by.
   Railway officials said no injuries were reported among
passengers of the train, which was headed for the coastal city of
Tarragona from Lerida.
   It was the second fatal train accident in Spain in a month. On
March 3, eight people died when one RENFE train rammed into a
second standing in a railway yard in a station in the northern city
of Valladolid.

   Affidavits released today show that
authorities found a skeleton buried in the police chief's yard
after being told the man died during a fight with the chief, who is
now married to the victim's ex-wife.
   Authorities on March 14 found the skeleton of Russell Bean about
20 feet down after they were told to dig in Police Chief Robert
Chambers' front yard.
   Chambers, who has since resigned as the part-time chief, has not
been charged in connection with the death. His lawyer has said
Chambers had nothing to do with it.
   An autopsy showed that Bean, 25, died 10 years ago of severe
blows to the head and chest.
   Affidavits unsealed in District Court today paint a picture of
wife swapping, brutality and alcohol abuse by Bean and Chambers,
who was a logger at the time.
   The statements allege that Chambers told his father 10 years ago
that he had accidentally killed a man in a fight and that father
and son buried the body.
   The affidavits allege that Chambers, now 36, and Bean, who were
considered close friends, had been drinking together in Marlow and
got into a fight, and that Bean fell and hit his head and died.
   The affidavits, used to obtain a search warrant to excavate the
yard, contained statements by Melissa Chambers, Lorrie Chambers and
Louis LaCourse. Melissa is Chambers' sister, Lorrie is her
daughter, and LaCourse is married to Chambers' sister Susan.
   Melissa said her father, Clifton, 61, told her about the
incident twice, but made her promise not to say anything until
after his death.
   The elder Chambers died March 9 of natural causes. Melissa went
to police the next day.
   Lorrie's affidavit confirmed Melissa's story.
   State Police Sgt. Clayton Young was quoted as saying that he
learned from the family that Bean's wife, Sylvia, telephoned Bean's
mother in September 1978 to say he had disappeared. Sylvia told
Bean's mother that she had learned from Chambers that Bean had
borrowed money, and Chambers had given him a ride to the Vermont
state line and dropped him off.
   Mrs. Bean won a divorce in June 1979, and she and Chambers were
married in September 1979.
   LaCourse's affidavit said Chambers initiated a conversation
about Bean shortly after the man was last seen.
   LaCourse said Chambers told him that ``he hit him so hard, no
one would ever see him again.
   ``Robert Chambers told Russ to hit the road and Russ did.''
   LaCourse said Chambers also told him that he, Bean, Sylvia and
Chambers' then-wife, Debbie, were swapping partners for sex.
   Melissa's statement was similar. She said the relationship
between the two couples ``was weird. ... I know Robert always beat
Debbie, that was why she ran off. (She) couldn't take it any
longer.''
   In addition to his Marlow job, Chambers has taken a leave of
absence as part-time chief in nearby Gilsum and has been suspended
as a trainee with the Winchester police department.

   Dr. Frank Calabro glanced out a window just
in time to see his beach house trundling down the street on a truck.
   ``I looked out the window and my house went by with a police
escort. I ran onto the street and said `Where are you going with my
house?''' Calabro said today.
   Calabro already had planned to move the two-bedroom,
960-square-foot beach house, which he valued at $12,000.
   ``I guess he (the thief) walked by, saw a house he liked on
moving stilts and decided he was going to take it,'' said Calabro.
   Calabro was visiting a real estate office Thursday when he saw
the traveling house and ran out and told the police escort it was
his house.
   ``He thought I was crazy,'' said Calabro. ``How often do you
stop a police escort and say, `This is my house'? He stopped the
truck. We were standing out there laughing hysterically. I had the
contract in my car for the house.''
   The thief, who was in a separate car behind the convoy, fled.
   ``Had I not seen it go by, we would have never found it. How do
you report a stolen house?'' said Calabro.
   John Williams, spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney
Patrick Henry, said an arrest was expected.
   Calabro, a physician with a family practice in Mastic Beach,
said he already had accepted a deposit to sell the house to someone
else. ``They didn't know they were going to get a famous house,''
he said.

   About 40 minutes after Willie Brown
walked out of prison, he married the woman who fought for five
years to get him off death row.
   ``I search for words to describe what I'm feeling. So far the
proper words to describe it haven't surfaced,'' Brown said Thursday
after he and Esther Lichtenfels exchanged vows on the lawn of the
Clay County Courthouse.
   ``I feel like I'm getting out of prison myself,'' his bride said
before they left for their new home in Springfield, Mass. ``I feel
wonderful. I'm so happy I can't tell you.''
   Brown, 37, was on parole from a Massachusetts prison when a
Pinellas County judge sentenced him to 20 years for armed robbery
in 1976. On July 7, 1981, while he was serving the time at Union
Correctional Institution, fellow inmate Earl Owens was stabbed to
death.
   Brown and another prisoner were charged with the slaying after a
third inmate, Frank Wise, said he saw them leaving Owens' cell
shortly before the murder was discovered. The two were convicted
and condemned.
   Ms. Lichtenfels met Brown on Christmas 1983 when she was with a
group visiting condemned prisoners who had no holiday visitors.
   ``He was the saddest face I'd ever seen when I met him. It was a
spiritual love right from the start,'' recalled Ms. Lichtenfels,
54, a divorcee with three grown children.
   It was at her prompting that defense lawyers pursued and won an
appeal on technical grounds in November that overturned the
convictions of Brown and co-defendant Larry Troy.
   Ms. Lichtenfels then she hired a private investigator and
tracked down Wise. They agreed to meet and she was given a hidden
microphone, with which Wise was recorded admitting that Brown was
innocent and asking for $2,000 to recant his testimony.
   Wise was arrested on bribery charges in December and Assistant
State Attorney Harris Tobin said in February that he would not to
prosecute Brown and Troy again because Wise's credibility was
damaged.
   Brown said that while Ms. Lichtenfels was fighting for the
appeal, he considered her optimism unrealistic. He tried to talk
her out of it, he said.
   But ``I didn't know what kind of person she was,'' he said.
``She believes in action.''
   Brown must complete his parole term in Massachusetts.

   Gallagher said a man carrying a gun entered the back of the

   About 100 firefighters from western
states were sent to the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee today
to fight fires which have broken out there, authorities said.
   Fires, abetted by strong shifting winds and dry weather, have
burned more than 1,300 acres in Tennessee since Wednesday. Five
separate fires were burning today.
   ``Even if it does rain it will probably be less than an inch,''
said Wilma Marine, a spokeswoman at Cherokee National Forest, where
a 300-acre fire had been contained.
   The U.S. Forest Service crews of about 200 firefighters from
Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona arrived Thursday.
   The largest blaze in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park has
grown to 500-plus acres about two miles west of Chilhowee Lake.
   A colony of red cockaded woodpeckers, an endangered species, was
threatened by that fire, said Misty Seagle, a clerk in the park
superintendent's office.
   No homes have been damaged by any of the fires.

<TEXT>
   An opposition leader returned to
Panama vowing to rid the nation of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and
sources today said the Roman Catholic church would issue its
harshest denunciation yet of the military strongman.
   It was the fifth day of a general strike that has paralyzed the
economy.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, head of the Christian Democratic Party,
arrived Thursday to find Panama in the midst of the anti-Noriega
general strike, which has shut down more than 90 percent of
business and industry.
   The government refused to allow Arias Calderon into the country
when he tried to return from a business trip to the United States
on Feb. 25, the day President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire
Noriega. Delvalle was in turn ousted by Noriega supporters.
   There was no reason given for blocking Arias Calderon's return,
and there was no reason given for his being allowed back. A
spokesman for the Christian Democratic Party, William Cochez, said
without elaborating that ``the government backed down.''
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said local U.S. officials warned
Arias Calderon to be prepared for a ``longer haul'' before Noriega
is forced from power. ``Nobody's talking about hours, nobody's
talking about days,'' said Ackerman, who is on a fact-finding tour
with Rep. Pete Kostmayer, D-Pa.
   Noriega is the country's de facto leader by virtue of his
influence as chief of the Defense Forces.
   Ackerman said he had been assured that the church soon would
release a statement carrying a ``strong message'' against Noriega.
   Sources from the opposition National Civic Crusade, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the message would be the church's
strongest statement yet against Noriega.
   Panama's Episcopal Conference of Bishops, led by Archbishop
Marcos G. McGrath, has sharply criticized Noriega in the past but
fallen short of calling for his ouster.
   McGrath met with Noriega on Thursday. McGrath had refused to
discuss the talks, saying only that he was not negotiating
Noriega's departure.
   Today was payday for the 15,000-strong Defense Forces. On
Monday, Noriega must come up with money for retirees already forced
to wait an extra week for their pensions.
   A banking source who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Thursday the government had pleaded with local banks to hand over
an estimated $70 million in their vaults. But the banks said the
money belonged to their depositors and they could not legally give
it up.
   In an attempt to force Noriega into exile, the United States has
frozen Panamanian deposits in U.S. banks and withheld payments for
use of the Panama canal. The U.S. dollar is Panama's currency.
   The country has been in an increasingly chaotic state since
Noriega was indicted on U.S. drug traffickng charges last month.
   Arias Calderon arrived on a commercial flight from Miami and
told a cheering crowd that Noriega must go.
   His return had ``but one objective _ to get rid of Noriega,''
Arias Calderon said. He was accompanied by Christian Democratic
leaders from Venezuela, Costa Rica and West Germany.
   Arias Calderon, a likely presidential candidate in scheduled May
1989 elections, said he would meet with other opposition leaders to
plan a strategy for ousting Noriega.
   The government stepped up its propaganda attacks Thursday
against the United States and its military presence along the
Panama Canal. The state radio station again urged Panamanians _
particularly soldiers and youth _ to be on guard against ``any
aggression by the United States.''
   The Foreign Relations Ministry denounced a background briefing
for journalists at the U.S. Southern Command headquarters on
Saturday. The Ministry accused the U.S. military of ``instructing''
reporters that they ``must help remove'' Noriega.
   The last of 670 military police and support personnel arrived
Thursday at U.S. bases to beef up security.
   Southern Command officials had said earlier the reinforcements
were ``simply good planning in view of the current unrest in
Panama.''
   President Reagan told high school students in Vienna, Va.,
Thursday he had no plans to take military action to get rid of
Noriega.
   ``We're not going to be the big colossus of the North once
again, coming in to ... our smaller neighbors' places of living and
business and trying to guide and direct them,'' Reagan said.

   A temporary cease-fire between the
Sandinistas and Contra rebels held today, and the army pulled out
of jungle war zones across the country to avoid clashes that would
imperil a new peace accord.
   Radio Liberacion, the Contras' radio station, has reported no
combat since Monday, the first day of cease-fire talks between the
government and Contras at the border town of Sapoa.
   An international verification commission was in its second day
of an inspection of the northern border with Honduras. The group
was asked by the Sandinista government to prove that its troops
were not across the border.
   The cease-fire talks ended Wednesday with the peace accord
between the government and the U.S.-supported Contras.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada today ran a special edition
about the pact. A front page editorial said, ``The Yankee
warmongers fail to give the final blow.''
   The four-page extra said the reaction of Nicaraguans was that
``Reagan and the Contras should comply.''
   The editorial called on the United States to open talks with the
Nicaraguan government. With the end of American aid to the Contras,
the ``Reagan administration has been disarmed, without pretexts to
ask for more funds for its warriors.''
   Both sides had called the Sapoa talks Nicaragua's last chance
for peace, and civilians greeted word of the pact with hope. One
critic of the leftist Sandinista government called it a miracle.
   Vice President Sergio Ramirez, in Mexico City to brief Mexican
President Miguel de la Madrid, called Thursday night for direct
talks with the Reagan administration to ensure the truce holds.
   The White House has rejected previous Sandinista calls for such
talks, saying the Sandinistas had first to negotiate with the
rebels.
   In Nicaragua, Sandinista troops withdrew Thursday from a jungle
war zone in central Chontales province, said a state security
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The province has been
a hot spot in the 6-year-old war that has cost more than 40,000
lives.
   To celebrate the accord, dozens of women gathered in the main
square of the Chontales city of Juigalpa and ``lit candles to the
Virgin Mary,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman said.
   As part of the agreement, Contra and Sandinista leaders extended
the informal cease-fire to April 1, when a 60-day truce takes
effect and they will meet in Managua to seek a permanent peace.
   Provisions of the agreement meet requirements of the regional
peace plan signed Aug. 7 by five Central American presidents _
ending the fighting, granting political amnesty and restoring
democratic freedoms.
   The opposition says the Sandinistas promised democracy when they
overthrew rightist President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979, but
instead established a Marxist regime.
   Enrique Bolanos, president of the Private Enterprise Council and
staunch critic of the government, called the pact ``a miracle.''
   In Costa Rica, President Oscar Arias said it offers ``a new and
firm hope that all Central Americans can live in peace.'' Arias won
the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the regional peace plan.
   On Monday, Sandinista and Contra negotiators will meet to
designate areas inside Nicaragua to which rebels will go during the
first two weeks of April.
   Nothing is said in the agreement about the Contras laying down
their weapons, so that may be taken up in next week's meetings. In
past negotiations, the rebels insisted on keeping their weapons
until provisions of any accord were carried out.
   The pact provides a gradual amnesty for Nicaragua's 3,300
political prisoners that starts on Sunday. It also also guarantees
``unrestricted freedom of expression,'' a condition demanded by the
rebels, and permits all exiles to return home and participate in
the political process.
   Once rebel fighters have moved into the truce zones, the Contra
leadership can send up to eight delegates to participate in
national reconciliation talks under way as part of the regional
peace plan, the agreement says.

   Jurors in the case of a man accused of
strangling a young woman during a Central Park tryst began their
ninth day of deliberations today after a tumultuous day during
which one juror reportedly asked to be dismissed.
   Jurors were expected today to begin rehearing medical testimony
that state Supreme Court Justice Howard E. Bell estimated would
take a day and a half to two days to complete.
   But shortly before noon, the jury had yet to hear a single word
of testimony and had not appeared in the courtroom. It was not
clear if the panel was deliberating the fate of Robert E. Chambers
Jr. as they awaited the readback of testimony.
   On Thursday, a juror asked Supreme Court Justice Howard E. Bell
to be dismissed because of an argument over the meaning of medical
testimony in the case, said a source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Chambers, 21, is accused of second-degree murder in the death of
18-year-old Jennifer Levin on Aug. 26, 1986. He could be convicted
of the lesser crimes of first- or second-degree manslaughter or
criminally negligent homicide.
   Bell, defense attorney Jack Litman and prosecutor Linda
Fairstein met in the judge's robing room. Despite requests from
lawyers for the New York Post and Newsday, the judge refused to
divulge what was discussed.
   Litman and Fairstein referred to ``that matter discussed in your
honor's robing room'' without providing details.
   One of the 12 jurors _ who have heard eight weeks of testimony _
could be replaced by an alternate at this point only with the
consent of both sides, and a mistrial could result if a juror
wanted to leave.
   Jurors were expected back in the courtroom today to begin
rehearing medical testimony that Bell estimated would take 1{ to
two days to complete.
   The prosecution contends Chambers strangled Miss Levin in a
rage. The defense has argued he killed her accidentally when he
yanked her backward to stop her from hurting him during rough sex
in Central Park.
   At jurors' request, Bell on Thursday instructed them on several
points of law, including burden of proof, circumstantial evidence,
reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence.
   The jury's request for a rereading of most of the medical
testimony by key defense and prosecution witnesses means lawyers
must go through about 1,500 pages of transcripts.
   The jury asked to hear testimony that bears only on the facts on
Miss Levin's injuries, not experts' theories on how they occurred.

   President Reagan said today he welcomes the
cease-fire in Nicaragua but ``there is reason to have caution'' as
to whether the couantry's leftist government will observe it.
   ``Of course we look forward to this and hope it continues, but I
think we should keep in mind that, just as in some other meetings
that have gone on in which I have been involved, I think that we
should keep in mind that both parties must be dedicated to the
things that are said and agreed to in those meetings,'' the
president said.
   When a reporter said that it sounded as though he were
suspicious that this would not be the case with the Sandinistas,
Reagan replied, ``I think there is reason to have caution; they
have a past record that indicates that we should be.''
   The president did not say who he was talking about, but he
supports the Contra rebels and has often said that he considers the
Sandinista government unreliable.
   The exchange with reporters took place as Reagan was preparing
to meet with visiting president Joaquin Belaguer of the Dominican
Republic.
   Earlier, Secretary of State George P. Shultz raised the
possibility that the administration will seek legislative authority
for a quick vote on military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels if the
cease-fire there breaks down.
   Shultz said Thursday night that the prospect of additional
military assistance to the rebels would be added insurance that
Nicaragua's leftist government will abide by promises it makes
under its cease-fire agreement with the Contra rebels.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., indicated that he would
oppose any effort by the administration to have an ``expedited
procedures'' provision for military aid included in a Contra
humanitarian assistance package the Congress will take up next week.
   ``I want to emphasize positive things, and not anticipate
failure,'' said Wright, who was interviewed with Shultz on PBS'
MacNeil@Lehrer ``NewsHour.''
   The reaction of both the administration and the Congress was
generally positive to the agreement reached by the Sandinistas and
the Contras, which calls for a 60-day cease fire during which talks
on a final settlement will take place.
   There is agreement among the administration and the lawmakers
that the United States should provide humanitarian aid to the
Contras _ permitted under the agreement _ but the comments of
Shultz and Wright indicate the military aid issue is not dead.
   ``I do think there is great merit ... to have in it (the
humanitarian aid package) a mechanism for a fast track vote,''
Shultz said. He said there should be a guaranteed early vote on
``whatever the president might ask for.''
   Wright said such a provision in the humanitarian aid package is
tantamount to having a discussion of terms for divorce during a
wedding ceremony.
   ``I think it's inappropriate at this time to be anticipating
failure,'' he added.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a longtime Contra aid supporter, said
he thought that any differences over an expedited procedure
provision could be ironed out.
   The agreement ``reduces the requirement, in our view, for lethal
aid,'' McCain said, adding that he believes real compromise is now
possible with Wright on that issue. ``Our differences of opinion
are not major,'' he said.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a critic of administration policy,
said he hopes the agreement will encourage the administration to
turn its attention away from ``a military approach, and will begin
to work in the context of this agreement for a lasting peace in
Nicaragua.''
   Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said: ``The U.S.
government now has a profound responsibility not to do anything
except what is in strict conformity with the precise terms of the
cease-fire, neither more nor less. We must not tinker with what the
Nicaraguans themselves have agreed to.''
   Shultz said he welcomes the agreement but that the Sandinistas
have a ``history of broken promises.''
   ``We have to maintain strength to go with negotiating efforts,''
he said.
   He added that the real issue in Nicaragua is democracy and not
whether the Sandinistas are in or out of power.
   ``If there is an open system and an election that's truly a
democratic election, and the people now in the government get
elected, we have no objection to that,'' he said. ``It's the
process that's the key.''

   The Democratic presidential candidates could have
stifled all that derisive early campaign talk about being ``the
seven dwarfs'' by simply playing along with the gag, says Professor
Joseph Boskin.
   ``If they were smart they would have labeled themselves _ `I'm
Grumpy, I'm Doc' _ and that would have undercut it. Whatever
happened to play in America?'' said Boskin, who is writing a book
about the connection between humor and social change.
   The Boston University history professor is disturbed that this
year's presidential candidates generally seem about as funny as a
doorknob.
   He labels Vice President George Bush the most sanctimonious in a
field full of self-righteousness and calls former candidate Gary
Hart ``a clear example of a dour approach to life.''
   The other men who would be president are no better when it comes
to humor, he said. ``They're basically a sterling bunch but I don't
hear the humanity of humor in them.''
   Boskin, 58, believes candidates need humor to prove they are
human, quick-thinking and slightly self-effacing _ ``not humor as a
form of oppression or a weapon but as a means of liberation or
perspective.''
   He links a demise of lightness with the rise of electronic
media, starting with radio. Until the 1930s, storytelling was an
art form, and public figures could rise a long way with a knack for
spinning good yarns.
   Now, with television time so precious and expensive, Boskin
said, ``Politicians think they have to get everything in in a
minute instead of seeing things in a larger contextual way.''
   The candidates do manage an occasional jab, an occasional jibe,
he admits. Bushy-browed Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
recently joked that Rep. Richard Gephardt had ``eyebrow envy'' _ a
line fed to him by an aide.
   ``You don't hear them spontaneously making things up as they go
along,'' Boskin said. ``What I've often argued is Dukakis needs a
levity adviser. The story about him is he's so straight he even
lines up his socks in his top drawer.''
   So who among recent U.S. leaders had a light touch? Boskin
admired John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey.
   Asked why he appointed his brother attorney general, Kennedy
once replied ``because he needs the experience.'' Boskin said
Humphrey ``would poke fun at himself for talking too long. He would
say `I should shut up now, but I can't.'''
   And which of this year's candidates are featured in the jokes
that criss-cross the nation and sometimes connect with pop culture
via television comedians?
   ``I hear jokes about Bush and Hart and nobody else,'' Boskin
said. ``And a continuance of Ronald Reagan jokes and how ridiculous
he is. He's fallen in prestige. You can tell through the humor.''
   According to Boskin, President Reagan is a ``throwback'' because
he tells stories. Reagan displayed an ability to laugh at himself
after he was shot in 1981, quipping that he hoped the doctors were
Republicans and quoting Winston Churchill about being shot at
``with no apparent effect.''
   ``If you can't laugh at youself and laugh at a situation it
bespeaks an inflexibility,'' Boskin said.
   ``I think one of the problems in America is we separate humor
out from seriousness. Politicians who are obviously concerned about
getting elected are more hypersensitive to this than others. They
think if they use humor they can't be taken seriously.''
   On the contrary, Boskin argues, if candidates show a sense of
humor the public is more likely to warm to them when talk turns to
weightier issues.
   To counter the Seven Dwarfs talk, the Democrats ``should have
gone to the five and dime and bought masks and gone before the
cameras,'' Boskin said, in all seriousness.

   Surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould has asked for twice-a-week visitation with Baby M,
while the child's father wants to block all visitation, according
to court briefs.
   ``... Only a suspension of visitation will ensure that Melissa
is provided with a loving, supportive, nurturing and peaceful
environment, free from interference, at the critical stages of her
development,'' said Gary Skoloff, a lawyer for the girl's father,
William Stern.
   In legal papers released today by Superior Court Judge Birger M.
Sween, Skoloff said he will present testimony at a visitation
hearing Monday that will show the child's psychological welfare is
at stake.
   ``Indeed it is contended that the proofs will indicate that the
emotional and psychological burden which Melissa will have to
sustain in establishing a relationship with Mrs. Whitehead will be
significantly more damaging than any benefit which might occur to
her as a result of visitation at this time,'' Skoloff said in the
25-page brief.
   The visitation hearing was ordered by the state Supreme Court in
its landmark ruling Feb. 3 that restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
parental rights while awarding custody of the baby, now known as
Melissa, to Stern and his wife, Elizabeth.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has been allowed to see Melissa once a
week, for two hours, under supervision at a youth center here.
Court papers released Thursday by Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney
called that schedule ``insufficient.''
   The East Brunswick housewife, who gained notoriety by refusing
to turn over the child she agreed to bear under a $10,000 contract,
says in court papers that she wants her visits with the child to be
expanded eventually to half the summer and some holidays.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould also rejected a request by Stern to
terminate contact between mother and child for at least six years.
She contends that a break in visitation could be harmful to the
child.
   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationship
with Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing
and productive relationship,'' her attorney argued.
   Legal briefs from both sides were filed with Sween earlier this
week. The judge released them today after he had time to review
them. However, Harold Cassidy, an attorney for Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould, released his brief Thursday.
   ``The warm, satisfying relationship which has come into
existence over the past two years would be lost to Melissa if
visitation were suspended,'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys said.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould requested that the visits be expanded
immediately to two days a week, eight hours each time, at her home
for the next six months.
   She also requested the scheduled be expanded to allow her to see
Melissa overnight every other week, alternate weekends when Melissa
is 3, and half the summer and one week of Christmas vacation when
the child is 5.
   The court papers say that when Melissa is 12 she may ``voice a
desire for more or less visitation.''
   Skoloff has said the Sterns want to delay visitations ``as long
as possible.''

   About 142,200 individuals or their families
will be eligible for a new military medal honoring American
prisoners of war, the Defense Department said Friday.
   ``The medal will be issued at no cost to any person who was
taken prisoner of war and held captive after April 5, 1917,'' the
Pentagon said in announcing it was ready to begin issuing the
award, which Congress authorized two years ago.
   ``To qualify, an individual must have been taken prisoner during
an armed conflict; i.e., World War I, World War II, Korea and
Vietnam, and must have rendered honorable service during the period
of captivity,'' the Pentagon statement said.
   The medal can be awarded posthumously to legal next-of-kin, but
the Pentagon said the criteria established by Congress would not
allow relatives of servicemen ``who are listed as missing in
action, but for whom there is no evidence of captivity as a POW,''
to receive the medal.
   The Defense Department estimated that 142,200 individuals or
their next-of-kin were eligible for the medal, which features an
eagle surrounded by barbed wire and bayonet points and includes the
inscription, ``For Honorable Service While a Prisoner of War.''
   ``The public law establishing the POW medal specifies that it
will be displayed immediately following decorations awarded for
individual heroism, meritorious achievement or meritorious service,
and before any other service medal, campaign medal or service
ribbon,'' the Pentagon said.
   A toll-free 800 telephone number has been set up for qualified
individuals to request an application form for the medal, the
Pentagon said. The application forms will also be distributed by a
number of veterans organizations and public service agencies.
   Using the form, an applicant will be expected to provide his
full name, service number, Social Security number, Veterans
Administration claim number, date and place of birth, branch of
service, unit of assignment when captured and dates of confinement
and release.
   Processing of the applications will take anywhere from 45 days
to 90 days because of the need to verify military records, the
Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon said it would prefer individuals to use the
application form, but would accept a personal letter mailed to the
proper military records center providing the same information as
that sought on the form.
   ``Applicants may also submit their requests through a third
party, such as a veterans organization or public official, who will
agree to receive the medal and present it to the requestor,'' the
Pentagon said.
   The phone number for requesting an application form is
800-873-3768.
   Personal letters requesting award of the medal or more
information should be sent to one of these three addresses:
   _For former Army prisoners of war: U.S. Army Reserve Personnel
Center, Attn.: DARP-PAS-EAW, 9700 Page Blvd., St. Louis, Mo.

   Yugoslav workers cheated West
Germany of up to $60 million in unemployment funds, authorities
said Friday.
   Bavarian police spokesman Gerhard Hoppe said 74 Yugoslavs had
been arrested in the past two weeks in the case. He said more
arrests were possible.
   Those arrested were suspected of fraudulently obtaining jobless
compensation worth $303,000. But he said other Yugoslavs apparently
bilked the West Germany government of $30 million to $60 million.
   The suspects had formerly worked in West Germany and applied for
unemployment compensation after losing their jobs, according to
Hoppe. They later moved back to Yugoslavia but made regular trips
to West Germany to continue collecting unemployment funds, he said.
   West German law stipulates only residents of the country are
eligible for unemployment payments.
   About 590,000 Yugoslavs live in West Germany. Most are employed
as ``guest workers'' who remain citizens of their home countries.

   A man linked to a leftist opposition group
probably died from police torture, but no one can be charged
because the authorities' own inquiry was substandard, a judge ruled
Friday.
   Njenga Karanja, 42, was held without charge and incommunicado
for three weeks before he died in February 1987 with injuries
consistent with beatings, according to testimony at the High Court
Inquest.
   Government Special Branch officers, who are responsible for
internal security, arrested Karanja at a coffee shop he owns in
Nakuru, 100 miles northwest of Nairobi, on Feb. 7, 1987. They
accused him of links with Mwakenya, a clandestine Marxist group.
   The group opposes the one-party state run by the
Western-leaning, capitalist government of President Daniel arap
Moi's Kenya African National Union.
   Ooki Ooko-Ombaka, a lawyer for Karanja's family, told the
inquest Karanja's death was the result of officials ``gone crazy
with unchecked power.''
   Amnesty International, a London-based human rights group, said
in a July report on Kenya that Karanja reportedly was tortured by
Special Branch officers.
   Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango said he suspected the prisoner had
indeed been tortured. However, he said the Special Branch's own
investigation into Karanja's death was ``not up to standard'' and
conducted ``with some kind of fear.''
   He recommended that Attorney General Matthew Muli's office
further investigate the case, but Muli wasn't bound by Mango's
ruling.
   Karanja, also a well-known road rally driver, is one of six
people who have died in police custody in Kenya in the last 14
months.

   Angry Palestinians on Friday buried six
of the eight women guerrillas killed in an Israeli air raid, and
they vowed to avenge their death by continuing the fight against
the Jewish state.
   ``Allahu Akbar (God is great), we shall avenge your death!''
chanted the mourners, many with their eyes brimming with tears.
   ``We shall kill all those who killed you! Your blood will not go
cheap!'' shrieked the mother of one of the dead women.
   The coffins, draped in Palestinian flags, were driven to Beirut
in ambulances from the southen port city of Sidon, where the eight
were killed Wednesday in an Israeli air strike on bases manned by
guerrillas of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council.
   About 3,000 Palestinians, men, women and children, carrying
Palestinian and Lebanese flags marched in the funeral procession
from west Beirut's Mar Elias refugee camp to the cemetery.
   Children carried wreaths from various Palesitnian and Lebanese
leftist factions. A wreath, signed Fatah-RC, led the procession
ahead of a contingent of armed Palestinian guerrillas.
   Many mourners carried placards proclaiming the Palestinians'
determination to continue the fight to liberate Palestine.
   Women ululated as the procession marched slowly to the
accompaniment of Palestinian revolutionary songs blared from
loudspeakers.
   Only six of the women were buried in Beirut's Martyrs' Cemetery.
The bodies of the other two were buried in refugee camps elsewhere
in Lebanon.
   Helmeted Syrian soldiers in charge of security in west Beirut
fired their Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifles in a final salute as the
six coffins were lowered into the ground.
   The Fatah Revolutionary Council group is led by convicted
terrorist Abu Nidal, who broke away from Yasser Arafat's mainstream
Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, tops the wanted
lists in the United States and Europe.
   In addition to the eight girls killed in Wednesday's raid,
another 15 people were wounded.
   An Israeli air raid Thursday against Fatah-RC bases in the same
three villages of Bekesta, Majdelyoun and Salhiyeh south of the
port city of Sidon left nine people dead and five wounded.

   Members of a condominium
association say they were mistaken in refusing to let a blind man
rent an apartment.
   ``We're hoping he's going to move in and be a neighbor. If he
moves in, he's going to be two doors from me. We're hoping this can
end up a positive thing from a negative thing,'' said Morris
Barnett, director of the Keswick B Condominium Association at

   He said he wanted to be sure ``all hostilities have cooled,
calmed down, that I feel comfortable and everybody feels
comfortable.''
   ``I think it looks optimistic,'' said Tomecek, a part-time
musician who says he has lived on his own the last four years in
Pennsylvania. ``It's probably the first time they met a blind
person.''
   If Tomecek accepts, his discrimination claim would be dropped,
said his attorney, Larry Corman.
   The president of the condominium in a letter to the owner of the
unit Tomecek was planning to rent said he was rejected because he
``unfortunately is blind.''

<HEAD>San Diego Zoo Animals Expose Employees To Tuberculosis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four San Diego Zoo employees tested positive
for tuberculosis after being exposed to infected monkeys, and a
state health official blamed improper quarantine procedures.
   Three of six endangered Tibetan macaques have died of
tuberculosis since arriving last March from the Chengdu Zoo in
China, officials said Thursday. The other macaques remain
quarantined although they tested negative for the disease.
   None of the four workers has tuberculosis so far, though one is
under medication, The San Diego Union quoted an unidentified source
as saying.
   A veterinarian who inspected the zoo for the state last spring
said Thursday he found several deficiencies that could have led to
the infection.
   Edmond Bayer, a consultant with the state Department of Health
Services, said employees did not regularly wear masks or gloves
while around the infectious macaques and were not told to wash
their hands before leaving the quarantine area.
   Don Janssen, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine, said
those safety procedures weren't in effect at that time. A memo
shows Janssen implemented changes last May to comply with Bayer's
findings.
   Among those infected with tuberculosis was Debbie Hewitt, 27, a
senior hospital keeper.
   ``I was upset and I'm still upset because we didn't have any
policy about quarantine procedures at the time,'' Hewitt said.
``I'm working there and I expect my employer to protect me about
things I don't know about and that wasn't being done.''
   In another incident, the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration recently fined the zoo $1,060 for two violations
stemming from improper animal and keeper contact.
   Zoo officials say the facility is contesting the citations and
declined comment.
   OSHA officials said their inspection was prompted by a complaint
and not related to the tuberculosis infection or the state
inspector's findings.
   OSHA cited the zoo for failing to protect its employees from the
possibility of contracting infectious diseases from animals, and
because keepers failed to use such protective equipment as boots,
gloves, aprons, pants, and protective eye wear or face shields.
   Tuberculosis, a bacterial disease, once was a leading cause of
death in the United States. It now is rarely fatal. Those who test
positive for the disease don't necessarily develop active cases,
said Nancy Bowen, TB control officer for the county.

   Two prisoners escaped from the Concordia
Parish jail and left a note thanking deputies for the tools they
used, officials said.
   George Hunter III, 28, and Ronnie Batteaste, 28, escaped late
Wednesday or early Thursday, authorities said.
   Deputies said the men used a hammer, srewdriver and hacksaw to
dismantle a light fixture in their cell block and crawl through a
ventilation shaft.
   ``Thank you for leaving the escape route and a box of tools,''
the note said. ``See you later, suckers.''
   Batteaste was being held on charges of burglary and escape
stemming from earlier incident. Hunter escaped the same jail in
1984 while he was being held on armed robbery charges. He was
caught more than a year later in California.
   Hunter was convicted on the armed robbery charges Wednesday in
District Court and was to have been sentenced Friday. He faced a
possible maximum of 99 years in prison for each of two counts.

<HEAD>Republican Congressmen Wary of Accord; To One It's `Disguised
Surrender'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Republican members of Congress are
wary of the cease-fire pact in Nicaragua _ one calls it a
``disguised surrender'' _ and say the United States will have to
continue pressuring the Sandinistas until they install a truly
democratic system.
   At the same time, the congressmen _ attending a GOP retreat here
_ say it was American pressure and American aid to the Contras that
forced the Sandinistas to deal with the Contras.
   The result was this week's dramatic turn of events: a 60-day
cease-fire agreement signed by representatives of the Nicaraguan
government and the guerrilla leaders, and a Sandinista promise to
institute democratic reforms.
   ``The goal has never been just a cease-fire,'' said Rep. Dick
Cheney, R-Wyo., one of six dozen GOP lawmakers at the retreat.
   The provisions on democratic reforms in the cease-fire pact are
``weak,'' he said, and the United States should try to keep the
Contras alive as a fighting force ``as a spur to continued good
faith on the part of the Sandinistas.''
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said it was ``reasonably
implausible'' that the Sandinistas would live up to their promises
for reforms. But if they do, it would have made the years of
supporting the Contras a successful policy.
   ``The values of the West will have won,'' he said. ``Our goal
was to have freedom, not to have a war.''
   Gingrich said one of the reasons he had doubts about the pact
was because the Contras were negotiating from a weakened state,
their U.S. aid having been cut off by Congress a month ago.
   It's too early to tell, he said, ``to what degree this is a true
negotiation and to what degree this is a disguised surrender'' by
the Contras.
   Cheney acknowledged that the Contras were ``in difficult
straits'' but said they ``still have some potential.''
   Rep. Rod Chandler, R-Wash., who has co-sponsored a plan to renew
military aid to the Contras, said the Sandinistas had ``failed
miserably'' when they crossed over into Honduras recently in what
he said was an attempt to ``deal a knockout blow to the Contras.''
   Chandler said the Sandinistas were under pressure not only
because of the Contras but because of their war-torn economy that
has resulted from the insurgency. ``If we had never supported the
Contras, they'd have never been a factor,'' he said.
   But if the Contras fold their tents and it is ``back to the
usual Sandinista behavior'' of totalitarian rule, he said, the
United States will have to ``take some action with external forces
... external, including the United States.''
   ``It's down to that,'' he said. ``It's definitely a new era.''
   In the meantime, Chandler said, he expected Congress to rapidly
approve some new humanitarian support for the Contras with the
option of adding military aid if things turn sour.
   Democratic leaders have been discussing with the White House and
with congressional Republicans a $48 million, year long package of
non-lethal aid. The plan would allow expedited consideration of
arms shipments if President Reagan requested them.
   Rep. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said that he felt the Contras ``were
not put in a very good bargaining position by the United States
Congress.'' He said he hopes that democracy takes root, but added:
``I'm a cynic.''
   DeWine said he feared ``this is just the beginning of the end
for the Contras.'' He said he wouldn't be surprised if the
Sandinistas over the next six to nine months tightened up their
authoritarian rule and at that point the United States is left with
``very little leverage.''
   ``It's a containment policy at that point'' with the U.S. trying
to help neighboring countries such as El Salvador and Costa Rica
maintain democracy.
   DeWine said he supported peace but, he added, ``Is it the peace
of slavery? Is it the peace of Eastern Europe? Is it the peace of
North Korea? Is it the peace of Cuba?''
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said he was more optimistic.
   ``If they really live up to their commitments, then it really is
a good deal,'' he said. If not, however, ``then we've got really
big problems.''

   The Reagan administration today launched its
final effort before leaving office to remove four-decade-old
prohibitions on industrial homework in five industries.
   The Labor Department said it will publish proposed regulations
next week that would allow employers to contract work from people
in their homes in producing gloves and mittens, embroideries,
buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry.
   Unlike the administration's two earlier attempts to deregulate
industrial homework, officials said this time they will not try to
remove the ban on women's apparel.
   Assistant Labor Secretary Fred Alvarez acknowledged that the
exclusion of women's apparel, an area in which investigators have
found about half of the violations of the current law, was aimed at
defusing opposition from the 210,000-member International Ladies
Garment Workers Union.
   The proposed revisions also do not attempt to overturn state
bans on the same type of work at home in Hawaii, California,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island
and New Jersey.
   The ILGWU, other unions and employer associations in California
and New York led a firestorm of attacks on the administration's
last two efforts to repeal the bans in 1981 and 1986.
   As a result, only the ban on knitted outerwear was lifted in
1984.
   Alvarez said the latest proposal will be open for 30 days of
public comment after it is published in the Federal Register next
week.
   Despite expected challenges from unions and anticipated court
appeals, he said the administration hopes to have the prohibitions
removed before Reagan leaves office next January.
   ``It seems to me we ought to be able to get a final rule
sometime this summer,'' he said.
   All of the current prohibitions were adopted from 1941 to 1943
under the Fair Labor Standards Act in response to what then was
perceived as rampant exploitation of mostly immigrant home workers
paid on a piecework basis.
   ``The recommendations of this administration demonstrate that it
has learned nothing from history,'' said the AFL-CIO. ``The record
shows that industrial homework has brought nothing but unfair
competition, long hours and low wages for our poorest and most
disadvantaged workers.''
   Alvarez, however, said unions have not yet had a chance to study
the latest proposal, which includes what he called a new set of
``enforcement teeth'' such as requiring bonds from employers with
records of paying less than minimum wages or other labor law
violations.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham's son testified today that
the family auto dealership was in ``very strong'' shape and that an
$80,000 loan from the governor's protocol fund was intended to
provide higher interest for the fund.
   Dennis Mecham, general manager of Mecham Pontiac, testified at
the governor's impeachment trial that his father called him in
mid-July 1987 and ``asked if I could use $80,000 in the dealership
operations.''
   The governor was expected to take the stand later today.
   Dennis Mecham said his father told him ``they were looking to
generate additional interest'' for the protocol fund.
   The prosecution has contended that the dealership was in dire
financial straits and needed the loan to meet its payroll.
   However, Dennis Mecham, asked by defense attorney Jerris Leonard
to describe the dealership's general financial condition at the
time, said, ``It was very strong.''
   About $6,000 of the loan was repaid to the protocol fund in
early October, and the governor's son said he was asked Oct. 22 by
Mecham then-chief of staff Jim Colter to repay the balance ``since
there was a political question.'' The repayment was financed by
family members, he said.
   On Thursday, former Mecham special assistant Sam Steiger said he
did not consider the protocol fund to be public money and thus the
loan was legal.
   ``I think we have a politically stupid thing that was done, but
not an illegal thing,'' Steiger said. ``I think it's a very clear
demonstration that here was a man, Governor Mecham, who had total
confidence that he was going to be able to repay this.
   ``He did not sense the public perception of what that might
appear to look like to other people because he was so convinced of
the correctness of his own approach,'' Steiger said. ``Now that's
the man that I knew as governor.''
   Steiger is scheduled to go on trial Monday on a charge of theft
by extortion for allegedly trying to influence the vote of a state
Parole Board member.
   Mecham is accused of misusing the protocol fund, which was
created with inaugural proceeds and intended to pay for gifts for
visiting dignitaries.
   Prosecutors claim the money became public funds when it was
turned over to the governor's office and that Mecham tried to cover
up the loan.
   However, the defense contends the protocol fund was private
money and that the loan was a good business deal because it earned
a higher interest rate for the fund.
   Mecham agreed Thursday in Tucson that borrowing from the
protocol fund ``was a dumb thing to do politically,'' but he
insisted it ``wasn't illegal.''
   He accused House prosecutors of having ``to make some kind of a
devious program out of this in order to have any fabric to say
anything about us.''
   ``They would be laughed out of any court in the country,
really,'' Mecham said. ``The only place they've got any standing is
because this is a political issue; it's really kind of a tragedy,
but I think our case will take care of that very easily.''
   The Senate already has heard testimony on the first impeachment
allegation that Mecham tried to thwart an investigation of an
alleged death threat by a state official against former top Mecham
aide Donna Carlson.
   The third allegation charges him with concealing a $350,000
campaign loan.
   A conviction would remove Mecham from office, although the trial
could continue on whether to bar him from holding any future office.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict
Mecham. He is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six
decades and the first ever in Arizona.
   Mecham is scheduled to go on criminal trial April 21 on six
felony charges of hiding the $350,000 loan and faces a May 17
recall election.

<TEXT>
   Choreographer Robert Joffrey, who founded a
dance troupe on a shoestring and built the Joffrey Ballet into one
of the nation's top companies, died this morning. He was 57.
   Joffrey, who had curtailed his duties at the company because of
illness, died at 6 a.m. at New York University Hospital, said
Pennie Curry, a spokeswoman for the company.
   He had suffered from a liver ailment caused by medication he was
receiving for asthma and a muscle condition, and had been in
intensive care for two weeks, she said.
   A lifelong asthmatic, Joffrey suffered severe asthma attacks in
August and had been working from his home since then, she said.
   Joffrey became ill in April 1986 and was diagnosed as having
severe myositis, which causes deterioration of the muscles,
enlarged liver and asthma. Earlier this month, he announced a
three-person advisory group to help Gerald Arpino, the company's
associate director, run the company.
   ``He had a passion and a love for dance. He respected dancers so
much. He loved to bring dance to parts of thew world that had never
seen it,'' said Gary Chryst, a former member of the Joffrey who
dance with the company for 11 years.
   In 1956, Joffrey borrowed a station wagon and sent his fledgling
dance company _ six dancers, one of whom could double on piano _
out to tour the United States. He stayed in New York, where he held
a job to pay for the tour.
   Today, the Joffrey Ballet ranks with the New York City Ballet
and American Ballet Theater as one of America's big three ballet
companies.
   Joffrey built by far the most far-ranging repertory. Nobody had
ever tried to recreate Vaslov Nijinsky's 1913 ``The Rite of
Spring,'' but Joffrey engaged two dance historians to see whether
they could recreate the ballet. The Joffrey version opened last
September in Los Angeles.
   Joffrey brought into the company ballets of strong classical
base and flowing quality by the British Royal Ballet's Frederick
Ashton; the 1932 stylized anti-war masterpiece, ``The Green
Table,'' by Kurt Jooss; a group of ballets created for Serge
Diaghilev; John Cranko's full-length ``Romeo and Juliet,'' dances
by American choreographers from Agnes de Mille to the avant-garde.
His own ballets include ``The Nutcracker'' in 1987 and his striking
1967 ``Astarte,'' where a couple dance in front of a billowing
white silk curtain on which a movie of them dancing is projected.
   Joffrey was the first artistic director to invite experimental
modern-dance choreographers to work with a major ballet company. He
brought Twyla Tharp to ballet in 1973. Arpino, one of the original
six dancers, is resident choreographer.
   Money was always a problem for the company, and Joffrey was
innovative in solving it. He decided that two bases were better
than one and announced a bi-coastal company, with boards and
fund-raising in both New York and Los Angeles.
   Last summer, he worked on his $1.5 million production of ``The
Nutcracker'' in Iowa City, Iowa, with one-third of the money coming
from New York, Los Angeles and the University of Iowa, where it
premiered.
   Joffrey was born Abdullah Jaffa Anver Bey Khan, in Seattle, Dec.
24, 1930. His father was a native of Afghanistan and his mother was
Italian. He had asthma as a child and a doctor suggested that he
take dance classes, for the breathing exercises.
   He started dance classes in Seattle, studied at the School of
American Ballet in New York and later with two modern-dance
teachers. His short performance career began with a solo concert of
his own works in Seattle. He danced with Roland Petit's Ballets de
Paris in 1949 and from 1950-52 danced sometimes in the concert
group of one of his modern-dance teachers, May O'Donnell.
   The Robert Joffrey Ballet Concert performed at New York's YMHA
in 1954 but Joffrey dated the founding of his company from 1956,
when he taught six dancers four pieces he had choreographed and
sent them out in a station wagon to 23 cities. Tours were annual
through 1964.
   Joffrey taught at the High School of Peforming Arts and
choreographed for the New York City Opera and other opera
companies, including choreographing ``Alcina'' in Dallas in which
Joan Sutherland made her American debut.
   By the spring of 1962, the company had 38 dancers and 21
ballets. That fall, the government sent the Joffrey Ballet on a
15-week tour of the Middle East. It was co-sponsored by the Rebekah
Harkness Foundation. The foundation sponsored the Joffrey Ballet
until March 1964 when Rebekah Harkness Kean decided to use the
money for a new Harkness Ballet, keeping dancers, costumes, sets,
scores and choreography from the previous two years.
   The Ford Foundation made a grant to get the Joffrey Ballet going
again. Joffrey did intense fund-raising and re-established the
company,which became the resident dance company at the City Center
in New York.
   Joffrey did not do much choreography in recent years. He
choreographed part of a new production of ``The Nutcracker Suite''
that was performed this year; his last full production,
``Postcards,'' was performed during the 1970s.
   He left no immediate survivors.
   Ms. Curry said a memorial service would be scheduled at a later
date. A viewing was planned for Frank B. Campbell's Funeral Home on
Sunday and Monday.

<TEXT>
   A young Irish woman, who came here to visit a
sweetheart but found him jailed on murder charges, was struck by a
car on St. Patrick's Day and lapsed into a coma, say her family and
friends.
   ``The girl is a beautiful looking girl. When I first saw her
lying there in the hospital, I thought to myself, `It's Snow White
in a trance,''' said Gerry Archbold, a director of the city's
Irish-American Heritage Center.
   Margaret Hanley, 22, was listed in critical condition today at
Weiss Memorial Hospital, where her parents are keeping a vigil at
her bedside.
   Stephen and Ann Hanley left their 13 younger children behind in
Coolock, a suburb of Dublin, and flew to Chicago to be with her.
Neighbors collected money to help pay for their trip.
   Miss Hanley's father said he was against his daughter's trip to
the United States earlier this month. ``But she wanted to travel
the world, you know,'' he said. And she had a special reason for
her trip.
   Last year she met a man named Danny Stokes, the brother of a
girlfriend, who'd returned to Ireland for a visit. She was
attracted to him.
   ``He took her out, and they must have communicated (when he
returned to Chicago),'' Archbold said. ``She was infatuated with
him.''
   So Miss Hanley, an aspiring actress who dreamed of traveling the
world, left her home for a three-week vacation and a visit to
Stokes.
   When she arrived in Chicago, she learned that Stokes was in
jail, charged with murder, Archbold said. He said he did not know
the details of the case against Stokes, but officials at the Cook
County Jail confirmed Thursday night that a Daniel Stokes was held
there on murder charges.
   Stokes said today in a telephone interview from jail that Miss
Hanley knew he was in custody before she came and wanted to help
him.
   ``It was very hard to accept, the emotional stress of seeing me
behind bars,'' he said.
   A disillusioned Miss Hanley called her family, telling them
she'd decided to return home and was planning to leave last Friday.
``She said she'd explain it all to us later,'' her father said.
   But the day before she was to leave, Miss Hanley was struck by a
car as she crossed a street on the North Side.
   Her leg and hip were broken, but she was conscious as she was
taken to a hospital emergency room, where she slipped into a coma
apparently induced by a blood clot, doctors said.
   Her parents spend their days at their daughter's bedside and
their nights at a room given to them by priests at the St. Patrick
Fathers home.
   ``All we can do is wait,'' Hanley said. ``There is nothing we
can do for her. Where there is life, there is hope.''

<HEAD>Sales Of Existing Homes Up 3.8 Percent In February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes, after declining for
three straight months, posted a modest increase of 3.8 percent in
February, a real estate trade group reported Friday.
   The National Association of Realtors said that existing
single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.29 million units in February. While this was 11.3 percent
below the sales level of a year ago, it was the first advance since
a 1.2 percent rise in October.
   Sales fell 2.9 percent in November, 1.2 percent in December and
4.8 percent in January as the housing market was rocked by volatile
mortgage rates and consumer worries sparked by the October stock
market collapse.
   The February increase in sales was credited to better economic
news, falling interest rates and renewed consumer confidence.
Fixed-rate mortgages, which stood at 10.61 percent at the beginning
of the year, have fallen into single-digits, standing at 9.92
percent currently.
   ``Lower interest rates have brought the consumer back into the
market,'' said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the association.
``February's existing home sales numbers indicate good health on
the part of the housing sector, which, in the sixth year of
expansion, is far from dead.''
   Tuccillo predicted the lower mortgage rates would help boost
sales even further in the months ahead.
   The rise in home sales was accompanied by a slight increase in
home prices. The median or mid-point price of a home increased to
$88,300, up from $87,400 in January.
   The increase in sales was led by a 12.8 percent jump in sales in
the South, which rose to an annual rate of 1.23 million units,
still 4.7 percent below the level of activity a year ago. This
region has been hard hit by depressed conditions in the oil
industry.
   Sales were also up in the Northeast, climbing 8.2 percent to an
annual rate of 660,000 units.
   Sales fell 5.4 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of
870,000 units, but analysts blamed this decline on unusually severe
weather in the region during February. Sales dipped a small 1.9
percent in the West to an annual rate of 520,000 units.

   President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican
Republic met with President Reagan today, declaring that his island
nation is ``as peaceful and tranquil as it can possibly be in
today's world.''
   Balaguer was expected to seek increases in aid and sugar quotas
during the meeting, according to a senior administration official
who spoke on condition he not be identified.
   The official said the United States was ``looking for ways to be
helpful.''
   As the two leaders posed for photographers before their meeting,
Balaguer was asked if everything was calm and peaceful in his
country, which has seen violent uprisings in the past.
   ``Yes, everything is calm and peaceful,'' he said. ``As peaceful
and tranquil as it can possibly be in today's world.''
   Reagan, asked if the same could be said of the United States,
replied, ``I would say that the situation is normal.''
   Balaguer, elected to his fifth term as president of the
Caribbean island nation in 1986, arrived in Washington on Thursday
and was meeting with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci as well as Reagan today.
   Reagan's meeting with Balaguer follows a visit Thursday to a
high school in the Washington suburb of Vienna. Appearing with
Education Secretary William J. Bennett, Reagan praised a trend
toward ``free-market principles'' in education that provide
incentives for teachers who achieve superior performance.
   The United States has sharply reduced aid to the Dominican
Republic in recent years and has lowered its quotas on imports of
sugar, a major Dominican crop.
   ``Their economic difficulties, and they have economic
difficulties, are largely the product of our sugar policy,'' said
the senior official, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified.
   ``Our imposition of lower and lower sugar quotas every year has
diminished their ability to sell sugar to the United States and
that has been a really crippling blow to the Dominican economy,''
the official said.
   The Reagan administration has pressed Congress unsuccessfully
for changes in U.S. sugar policy.
   Inflation is running at around 30 percent and unemployment at
close to that figure in the Dominican Republic, the official said.
   ``We are very appreciative of the efforts of President Balaguer
to keep the economy of his country on an even keel,'' the official
said. ``I don't think there is anybody in the Dominican Republic
who is appreciative of our aid cuts or cuts in the sugar quota.''
   Although the Dominican Republic has received substantial U.S.
aid in the past, it is down for nothing in either economic support
funds or military assistance in the fiscal 1988 budget. The figure
for development assistance is a relatively modest $18.7 million.
   The sugar quota declined about 27 per cent this year and is ``on
a downward trend,'' the official said.
   In 1983 the United States bought 500,000 tons, or $188 million
worth, of Dominican sugar. This year the total was 125,000 tons,
valued at about $50 million.
   ``They will ask for additional aid, either direct financial aid
or other forms of assistance,'' the official said.
   ``We are looking for ways to be helpful,'' he added.

   Soviet Armenia's government ordered the
dissolution Friday of a committee agitating for annexation of a
region in neighboring Azerbaijan. Soldiers and helicopters
patrolled tense Yerevan, the capital, in case of trouble.
   The Kremlin declared this week that the campaign for annexation
of the Nagorno-Karabakh region was ``intolerable.''
   Public protests had been called for Saturday in Yerevan, but
radio broadcasts in Armenia and Azerbaijan warned citizens of both
Caucasus republics Friday against illegal demonstrations.
   The broadcasts announced new regulations requiring permits 10
days in advance of all public gatherings.
   Hovik Vassilian, an Armenian activist reached by telephone, said
the Saturday demonstrations ``won't happen.'' Vassilian said they
were called off, ``considering the situation.''
   He also said activists had learned that Armenian nationalist
Paruyr Arikyan was arrested Thursday night. He said they did not
know the charges, but Arikyan had provided information about the
protests to foreign reporters in Moscow.
   An Armenian Communist Party newspaper reaching Moscow on Friday
said the republic ``remains tense and explosive.'' It spoke of
``unpredictable consequences'' if the demonstrations were held.
   Activists and official sources in Yerevan most Armenians
appeared to be wary of illegal protest because of the crackdown.
   A duty officer at the police ministry described the security
precautions by telephone and said Yerevan was ``fairly calm.'' He
would not give his nam.
   Vassilian said groups of three to five soldiers of the internal
security forces were patrolling with police and that helicopters
had been circling over the city for three days.
   Repeated attempts to telephone Azerbaijan on Friday were
unsuccessful.
   On Thursday, the national party's governing Politburo issued an
eight-year plan for dealing with complaints about discrimination
against ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, where they are more
than 75 percent of the population.
   Pravda and Izvestia, the party and government newspapers, gave
prominent display Friday to letters from readers urging reason and
patience in resolving the territorial dispute between Armenians,
most of whom are Christians, and the predominently Shiite Moslem
population of Azerbaijan.
   The letters, and official commentaries, had the apparent purpose
of portraying the leadership's approach to the sensitive ethnic
issue as a wiser course than strikes and demonstrations.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the Politburo's eight-year
plan provides for more housing, roads, schools and social services
in the disputed region, and more Armenian television programming
and literature.
   Concern that Nagorno-Karabakh was losing its traditional
Armenian character was among the reasons prompting calls for
annexation.
   Armenian residents of the area began protests in mid-February
after the national party Central Committee rejected a request from
the the Nagorno-Karabakh government for union with Armenia. The
region, slightly smaller than Delaware, was part of Armenia until
1923.
   Official media described the annexation drive as an extremist
action, and hundreds of thousands of Armenians demonstrated in the
streets of Yerevan. The mass unrest abated only after Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for calm and reason.
   On Feb. 28, extremists in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, went on a rampage
to protest the Armenian demands, and officials said at least 32
people were killed. The official reports said 197 were injured and
about 400 arrested for murder, rape, robbery or other crimes in the
industrial city.
   Armenian supporters of the annexation proposal, including some
prominent officials in the southern republic, formed a committee to
press the Nagorno-Karabakh issue and called the protests for
Saturday.
   The committee withdrew the appeal for protests, but nonetheless
became a target of authorities.
   Wednesday's issue of Kommunist, the Armenian party daily that
reached Moscow on Friday, accused the committee of blackmail,
threats and anti-party attacks.
   It said officials were ordered to ``take measures necessary to
avert meetings on March 26'' and party organizations were told to
``neutralize activities of Nagorno-Karabakh `committees' because at
present their actions are politically harmful.''
   Vassilian, the activist, also said the committee was ordered
``closed'' Friday.
   Prominent officials and literary figures appealed on radio and
television for patience and an end to protests and strikes, he said.
   Pravda said it was suspending an Armenian journalist who
contributed to a report on the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute but
denounced it after publication Monday.
   The party newspaper said it had handwritten copies of the
information submitted by the journalist, identified as Y.
Arakelyan, and his report conformed with the published article. It
did not give details of his original material.

   The head of the nation's largest teachers'
union today proposed that every state designate a school district
as a ``living laboratory'' for experiments aimed at producing
better educated students.
   National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell
said she will ask her state affiliates to work with governors,
state legislators and state school officials to bring about such
experiments on a broad scale.
   She told a news conference that teachers, parents and others in
the experimental districts would have the union's blessings to
``turn their school systems upside down or inside out'' in pursuit
of improvements.
   In response, Secretary of Education William J. Bennett said in a
statement:
   ``It's rather ironic to hear a call for reform from the
organization that has done the most to resist meaningful education
reforms in recent years. But if they are serious, it will be a
welcome and refreshing change to have NEA begin supporting real
education reform.''
   Each state should have at least one district operating ``as an
experimental, living laboratory for education reform,'' Futrell
said.
   ``In these 50 school districts, school employees, working
through their local association, would join with school boards,
parents, civic leaders and business to develop whatever innovative
or creative program they deem appropriate to improve education,''
she said.
   ``Those 50 local communities would be free to turn their school
systems upside down or inside out,'' she said.
   ``They would be free to open their school doors to 4-year-olds,
or end the arbitrary division of class periods into 50-minute
chunks, or experiment with alternatives to student tracking,'' she
said.
   Futrell said the idea must still be approved by delegates to the
NEA's annual convention in New Orleans in July.
   Futrell told the news conference that if a laboratory school
district decided to adopt a merit pay plan, the national union
would not object.
   She also said the NEA was prepared to provide some financial
support for the experiments and said that bold action is needed to
revive what she called lagging efforts to improve America's schools.
   ``Five years after `A Nation At Risk,' lack of funding is
strangling education reform in state after state,'' she said,
referring to the landmark report on the state of education.
   She said Secretary of Education William J. Bennett ``wants
America to believe that excellence costs nothing, that just talking
about reform _ and blaming people _ will substitute for money. It
won't.''
   State and local governments have poured more money into public
schools, she said, ``but they can't do the job without help from
the federal government.''
   The federal share of the public school budget has slipped from
9.2 percent in fiscal 1980 to 6.2 percent in fiscal 1988, she said,
and education's share of the overall federal budget has dropped
from 2.5 percent in fiscal 1979 to 1.8 percent in fiscal 1987.

   An oil rig explosion unleashed a ``big
ball of fire'' that injured 12 people, including several women and
children, who were celebrating a new well, authorities said.
   Ten people were still hospitalized today, including a 5-year-old
boy and a 32-year-old man reported in critical condition with
burns, hospital officials here and in Wichita said. One man was
listed in serious condition, and the others were in fair condition.
   The men, women and children were gathered in front of the oil
rig shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday and were ``supposedly bringing
in a new well'' when it exploded, Ness County Sheriff Gary O'Brien
said.
   Flames engulfed the building before firefighters could control
the fire, O'Brien said. Crews extinguished most of the fire by
11:30 p.m. The cause of the fire and explosion has not been
determined.
   O'Brien said he did not know the name of the company that owned
the well, about 3{ miles northwest of Ness City in western Kansas.

   King Birendra of Nepal called for
solidarity among the globe's 650 million Hindus Friday as he opened
the World Hindu Conference.
   About 1,200 participants from 19 countries attended the opening
ceremony of the four-day meeting in Katmandu.
   Representatives from Bangladesh, Canada, Fiji, Guyana,
Indonesia, India, Kenya, Mauritius, Nepal, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Spain, the United
Kingdom, the Soviet Union and West Germany paraded through the
conference venue at National Stadium.
   King Birendra, in his inaugural speech, said the conference
would ``succeed in establishing unity and solidarity among Hindus
wherever they be showing the ideal way of life.''
   Hindus live in significant numbers in at least 80 countries
worldwide, with the vast majority in India. Their religion grew
from a synthesis of indigenous beliefs with culture brought to
India by the Aryan people around 1500 B.C.

   Japanese monopolies on trade in tobacco and
beef must be eliminated because they are barriers to U.S. exports,
a former Agriculture Department official said Friday during his
confirmation hearing for the post of top U.S. negotiator on farm
trade.
   ``The monopolies must go,'' Daniel G. Amstutz, a former
undersecretary of agriculture, told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``They are barriers to trade just as sure as import
quotas are. ... They are a kind of marriage between industry and
government.''
   He said the U.S. government is insisting on elimination of
Japanese quotas on beef imports.
   ``I think we'll be successful,'' he added.
   Amstutz agreed with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who urged U.S.
negotiators to push international sales of cigarettes and other
tobacco products.
   ``This is not the place to make moral judgments,'' Amstutz said
after the hearing.
   The official U.S. campaign against smoking was not discussed at
the session itself. McConnell said moral judgments about practises
in other countries are ``not up to us.''
   McConnell estimated that the U.S. share of Japan's cigarette
market rose from 2 percent to 11 percent in two months after U.S.
pressure succeeded in easing restrictions on Japanese imports. He
urged Amstutz to be aggressive in getting restrictions eased in
South Korea too.
   He said that despite the popularity of Turkish tobacco, many
Turkish workers acquired a taste for American tobacco as ``guest
workers'' in West Germany and created a demand for it when they
returned home. Smoking in Turkey is on the increase and the United
States should take advantage of the opportunity, he said.
   Amstutz declined to say what priority he would give to pressing
cigarette sales.
   ``Everything is first,'' he said.
   He explained that at the big international trade discussions in
Geneva, Switzerland, known as the ``Uruguay round,'' an effort is
being made to keep the negotiations away from particular products.
   On farm products, the emphasis has been on reducing government
subsidies. The Reagan administration has proposed that all
government farm subsidies be phased out by the year 2000. Other
governments have called the goal unrealistic.
   The committee is expected to approve Amstutz's nomination next
week.

   A judge sentenced 20 taxi drivers to jail
Friday after they defied the city's new anti-smog ban.
   The new rules, which allows taxis and private cars in a
5-square-mile area of downtown only on alternate weekdays and on
weekends, are aimed at dispelling the acrid cloud that hovers over
the city in still weather. The cabbies say they are not at fault
and the ban hurts their business.
   The 20 taxi drivers were sentenced to five weeks in jail.
Another 35 cabbies were fined $150 each, said a judiciary spokesman
requesting anonymity.
   The 55 cabbies drove into the banned area on Monday and Tuesday
during protests organized by their union, which seeks daily access
for all the city's 15,000 taxis.
   The spokesman said all 20 cabbies were freed after appealing the
sentences.

   The chancellor of Fayetteville State
University is so sure he can raise the quality of the school's
education students that he will offer a warranty on every teacher
graduating after 1993.
   If a teacher fresh from FSU, or the school district where he or
she is employed, can identify weaknesses in the teacher's
preparation, a team of FSU specialists ``will make their product
good,'' Chancellor Lloyd Hackley said.
   The specialists will make recommendations on course work,
consultation or counseling, and establish a baseline to document
the teacher's improvement.
   Hackley announced the warranty Thursday as part of a sweeping
plan for improvements.
   Hackley said the school's development has been retarded by a
lack of adequate state and federal funding during most of its
existence, plus low financial support from alumni.

<TEXT>
   Three boys removed from a religious
commune by court order and returned to their fathers, at least
temporarily, had been physically and emotionally abused by cult
leaders, the fathers say.
   Deputies surprised devotees of the Tony and Susan Alamo
Foundation communes in Saugus on Thursday, reuniting the children
with their fathers before a custody hearing in Orange County
Superior Court.
   ``There was a lot of confusion and cries of anguish from the
adults,'' Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. Larry Brakebush said.
``There were people everywhere, people running around the grounds
shouting.''
   The boys' mothers weren't at the Alamo Holy Christian Church
commune when the raid took place.
   Alamo gained notoriety when he vowed that his wife Susan, who
died of cancer in 1982, would be resurrected. He kept her embalmed
body on display for six months while followers prayed.
   The custody dispute involves brothers Carey and Robert Miller of
Orange, who were banished from the commune after 15 years as
members following a disagreement over control of a trucking firm
they operated in Arkansas.
   ``My wife is absolutely and completely brainwashed by Tony Alamo
to the extent that she has now consented to live with another man
as husband and wife,'' Carey Miller, 34, said in a sworn statement.
``I am given to understand that I was now an outsider and would be
prevented from seeing my wife and children.''
   The men filed court statements contending the children were
abused, physically and emotionally, by their mothers and cult
leaders, and that they feared their sons would soon be taken to
Canada if they didn't act to regain custody. Both have begun
divorce proceedings.
   They also said they were wrongly separated from their families
after a business dispute with church leaders, contentions the
commune's founder denied.
   ``They abandoned their wives and children, embezzled money from
the church and lied in court about it,'' Alamo said Thursday in a
telephone interview from New York.
   The foundation has sued the brothers for allegedly emptying the
trucking company's bank accounts when they left the commune. Alamo
said commune members agree to sign over all property to the church,
something the brothers balked at doing with their trucking company.
   Judge Ronald Owen granted the Millers temporary custody of the
boys, ages 11, 9 and 4, until an informal mediation session April 6
and a court hearing five days later to hear arguments about
permanent custody.
   Attorneys for the two mothers, Carol Ann and Susan Miller, and
the church said the women were in New York City selling clothes
made at the commmune northwest of Los Angeles.
   The Miller brothers said they fled the commune in fear of their
lives in September after an altercation with Alamo and church
officers.
   ``I never threatened anybody,'' said Alamo.
   Alamo and his wife started preaching on Hollywood's Sunset Strip
in 1966. They attracted numerous young followers and formed a
commune in Saugus, later moving it to Arkansas. Recently they moved
their headquarters back to California but still have centers in
Chicago, Miami, Arizona and Arkansas.

<HEAD>Health Advisory Issued On Egg Contamination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health authorities have warned that eggs
from two farms near the site of a chemical fire last year contain
toxic dioxin at levels 100 times greater than in normal eggs.
   Officials of the state Health Services Department said Thursday
they advised about about 45 familes living near the Koppers Wood
Treatment Plant not to eat eggs or chicken from the two family
farms.
   Koppers was the site last April of a fire and explosion that
left residues of a toxic wood preservative used at the plant.
   Dioxins are a class of toxic chemicals found in a variety of
chemical compounds, including some preservatives. Minute levels are
also generally found in all animal products.
   While there is no proof that dioxin has ever killed anyone, a
1980 report by the Environmental Protection Agency said immediate
effects of exposure to dioxin can include burning in the eyes,
nose, and throat; headaches; itching, swelling and redness of the
face; dizziness; nausea and vomiting.
   There is also increasing evidence of an association between
occupational exposure to dioxins and a rare form of tumor called
soft tissue sarcoma, according to the national Centers for Disease
Control.
   The eggs and chickens may have been contaminated as a result of
the Koppers accident, but an investigation is continuing to pin
down the source, said state Health Services Director Ken Kizer.
   ``If we knew the cause of the contamination, we would say so,''
said Bob Borzelleri of the department's toxics division.
   Samples taken from the two affected farms last May showed dioxin
levels of 10 parts per trillion, compared with levels of 0.1 parts
per trillion found in eggs a few miles away.
   Samples taken this month show dioxin levels ranging from 15 to
30 parts per trillion.
   Eating one contaminated egg a day over a 70-year lifetime would
increase a person's chances of developing cancer from 250-in-1,000
to 253-in-1,000, the department's scientists estimate.
   Herb Lightle, who owns one of the farms, said he was angry that
the state testing took so long.
   ``One of my daughters loves to eat eggs. ... I'm worried for my
kids,'' Lightle said. ``The state told us after the fire it was OK
to eat our eggs and stuff out of the garden. They should have
issued an advisory from the very start. I would rather have buried
the eggs or thrown them out.''

<HEAD>Li Endorces Reform, But Sounds Note of Caution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Acting Premier Li Peng declared Friday that
economic reform was irreversible but cautioned against hasty change
as he opened the National People's Congress.
   The 59-year-old technocrat is expected to be confirmed as
premier during the legislature's 20-day session.
   In the 2{-hour speech, Li resoundingly endorsed the nation's
reform goals. But he stayed true to form by sounding repeated notes
of caution against expecting rapid prosperity or making changes
faster than people can accept them.
   ``We must not rush headlong into mass action, issue arbitrary
orders and spoil things by excessive enthusiasm,'' Li warned. ``We
cannot succeed if we are too impatient for quick results.''
   The new National People's Congress, which sits for five years,
is expected to approve key measures giving legal underpinning to
the market-style economic reforms that have doubled Chinese incomes
over the past decade.
   The congress itself is intended to be a showpiece of the
reforms. Its 2,970 delegates were elected by provincial
legislatures and the military using multiple candidate balloting
for the first time.
   Several working meetings are being opened for the first time to
foreign reporters, in addition to the ceremonial opening and
closing sessions. Before the start of Friday's session, reporters
were allowed to mix freely with delegates as they drank tea at
small tables in the cavernous entry room of the Great Hall of the
People and watched ``Tom and Jerry'' cartoons on a small TV at one
end.
   In his speech, Li applauded the achievements of China's economic
decentralization and said the state's role in the economy gradually
will be reduced from that of planner to indirect market regulator.
   Li generally is regarded as more cautious than his predecessor,
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who has become the leading
architect of all-out economic and political decentralization.
   However, he echoed Zhao's words by declaring that increased
productivity must be ``the criterion for judging all our work.''
   At a major party congress in October at which he was named party
general secretary, Zhao said development must take precedence over
ideology if China is to end its chronic poverty.
   ``We should continue to put reform at the center of all our
undertakings,'' Li said in agreement. ``It has become an
irreversible trend for the masses and cadres alike to take an
active part in the reform.''
   Zhao, who sat behind Li on the stage, appeared restless during
the long speech. On his left, senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 83, the
initiator of the reforms, followed the text closely while
chain-smoking.
   He said price increases were China's No. 1 economic and social
problem, but for the first time in public endorsed continuing the
gradual decontrol of prices long distorted by stae subsidies.
   However, he said workers will be given direct subsidies for some
staple foods, on which price ceilings will be imposed. Inflation
was 7.3 percent nationwide last year but hit 19 percent in some
cities during the summer.
   Li said that in the next five years, China must increase grain
production, encourage scientific development, revitalize the
bureaucracy and reduce controls on enterprises.
   One of the few specific goals he set was to raise grain
production by about 8 million tons, or 2 percent, per year. Grain
production hit a record of 407 million tons in 1984 but since has
declined, causing shortages of livestock feed and pork rationing.
   Delegates interrupted Li's speech with applause 17 times,
generally at natural pauses in the text. When he finished, applause
was brief and perfunctory and the huge hall emptied within five
minutes as top officials rushed to their chauffeur-driven Mercedes
Benzes and ordinary delegates to their buses.
   Li, grinning widely, was congratulated by his colleagues in the
party and government leadership as he walked back to his seat and
gulped tea.
   The congress will hold four more plenary sessions to hear
reports from top officials before gathering April 13 to vote on
proposed legislation and elect top officials.
   The congress also is expected to name Gen. Yang Shangkun as
successor to outgoing President Li Xiannian.
   Although the congress long has served as a rubber-stamp body for
Communist Party decisions, in the past few years it has taken a
more active role in debating and even amending party proposals.

   Bob Dole conceded today that George Bush was almost certain to
win the Republican presidential nomination, saying, ``I can read
the numbers.'' On the Democratic side, Richard Gephardt denied
reports that his candidacy was near an end and declared ``we're
going to turn this race back around'' in Michigan's caucuses.
   Dole, the Senate Republican leader, indicated he was in the
process of re-evaluating his presidential campaign and would likely
``have something to say about that'' before the April 5 Wisconsin
primary.
   ``I've been saying now for some time as a candidate all the
things I thought we should focus on and nobody really seems to
care,'' Dole told his audience. ``I think it's probably a foregone
conclusion what's happening on the Republican side.''
   ``But I still have some things to say,'' he added. ``Lo and
behold, as your candidacy weakens, you find more people willing to
listen.''
   Still, he said, ``I can read the numbers and I probably know
what's happening.'' Bush has won a huge lead in delegates in the
past month.
   All five Democratic presidential candidates were in Michigan
today, scouring the state for votes on the eve of Saturday's
caucuses with 138 delegates up for grabs.
   Gephardt clearly had the most at stake in Michigan, a state his
own aides described as a do-or-die situation for his once vital
presidential campaign. The Missouri congressman mimicked rival
Michael Dukakis' claim of an economic miracle in Massachusetts,
saying he looked forward to a ``Michigan miracle'' to revive his
candidacy.
   ``I think we're going to turn this race back around here in
Michigan,'' he said on CBS' ``This Morning'' program. ``We're going
to get back in the middle of this thing.''
   His aides said Thursday that without a win this weekend, the
Missouri congressman would end his presidential bid and run for
re-election to his House seat. The filing deadline for the House
seat is Tuesday.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, a Democratic rival, said today at a
Lansing airport news conference, ``My hope is that Dick can stay in
the race.''
   As for the possibility that he himself would win no delegates in
Michigan, Simon said, ``I recognize that's a possibility but it's
not fatal to my campaign.''
   Fellow Democrat Jesse Jackson campaigned in Detroit's county
jail today, telling inmates they must take control of their lives
and shun the ``short-term thrill, long-term chill'' of drugs. He
urged the inmates at the Wayne County Jail to ask for absentee
ballots and vote in Saturday's caucuses.
   Bush campaigned Thursday in Connecticut, where he was expected
to cruise to an easy win in Tuesday's primary. He grew up in the
state, and his father was a U.S. senator from Connecticut.
   Bush has been under fire in recent days for supporting President
Reagan's veto of a sweeping civil rights bill. Congress overrode
the veto this week.
   The vice president said he favored the basic premise of the
bill, but didn't want to go against the president on the matter.
Besides, he said, the legislation was flawed. Jackson has scoffed
at that, saying Bush lacks leadership.
   ``Perhaps Rev. Jackson was talking when he should have been
listening,'' Bush retorted Thursday. ``If he's the nominee, we'll
have a chance to discuss civil rights records and I'll lay my
record on the ground with anybody.''
   Bush suggested Jackson's Democratic rivals were too timid about
criticizing him. ``It's not that I'm afraid to do what some
Democrats are afraid to do _ go after him,'' he said.
   At a news conference, the vice president also expressed
admiration for former White House aide Oliver North, who pleaded
innocent Thursday in Washington to criminal charges in connection
with the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``I think anybody who sheds his blood for his country and wins a
Purple Heart _ three of them _ and a Silver Star deserves whatever
accolades one gets for that kind of stellar heroic performance,''
he said.
   Bush said he did not expect the arms-for-hostages affair to hurt
his campaign.
   ``The Democrats will be trying to raise it and make an issue out
of it,'' he said, but added: ``I don't think anyone has ever
implicated me or suggested any wrongdoing.''
   For the second time this week, a poll suggested Bush would have
a tough fight on his hands if he were running against Democrat
Michael Dukakis. A CBS-New York Times poll indicated 46 percent of
all registered voters polled favored Bush and 45 percent backed
Dukakis. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   A survey by ABC News and The Washington Post also put the two
neck and neck, with Dukakis polling the best against Bush among the
Democrats.
   Dukakis had a round of appearances today in Michigan. On
Thursday, he was replenishing an already impressive campaign
treasury with fundraisers in California.
   In Los Angeles, the Massachusetts governor fielded questions in
English and Spanish. Asked whether he would consider a Hispanic
running mate, he answered ``Vamos a ver'' _ we'll see.
   Republican Pat Robertson, who was crushed in the big round of
Super Tuesday contests earlier this month, said no matter what the
press or anyone else says, his candidacy isn't dead.
   ``I don't think they are aware of the Resurrection,'' the former
television evangelist told supporters in Falls Church, Va.
   At recent appearances, however, Robertson has acknowledged he
has little chance to win the nomination and is concentrating on his
role at the convention and his impact on the party.

   President Reagan said Friday the record of
Nicaragua's Marxist-led government indicates ``there is reason to
have caution'' that it may not live up to the cease-fire agreement
reached with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   It was the first time Reagan had commented in any detail on the
60-day nationwide cease-fire, effective April 1, that was announced
Wednesday after negotiations in Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   ``Of course we look forward to this and hope it continues, but
... just as in some other meetings that have gone on in which I
have been involved, I think that we should keep in mind that both
parties must be dedicated to the things that are said and agreed to
in those meetings,'' the president said.
   When a reporter said that it sounded as though he were
suspicious that this would not be the case with the Sandinistas,
Reagan replied, ``I think there is reason to have caution _ they
have a past record that indicates that we should be.''
   The exchange with reporters took place as Reagan was preparing
to meet with visiting president Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican
Republic.
   During his daily White House news briefing earlier, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters ``we are having
discussions with the resistance leadership'' about the new
cease-fire plan.
   ``We're very hopeful that it works,'' Fitzwater said. ``We want
to do whatever we can to see that it works.''
   But at the same time, the spokesman said the administration is
``very hopeful'' that a package of humanitarian assistance to the
Contras can be approved by the House and Senate before Congress'
Easter recess.
   He said that while the administration remained somewhat
skeptical of the Sandinista intentions, a mutually agreed
cease-fire between the Marxist regime and the Contra rebels ``was
the No. 1 item on the agenda'' in the joint peace plan that Reagan
offered last August in coordination with House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas.
   Fitzwater also said Friday the United States had no intention of
entering into direct discussions with the Sandinistas _ as
suggested by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   ``We have never envisioned bilateral talks. ... We have said
that once a cease-fire was reached ... we would be willing to talk
on a multilateral, regional basis'' involving the leaders of
Central American democracies.
   Fitzwater declined to speculate on what motivated the resistance
fighters to enter into a cease-fire agreement, although he did say
``it's certainly understandable that they would find the Congress
less than supportive,'' given the defeat of new aid packages on
Capitol Hill.
   The spokesman reiterated administration statements urging the
Soviet Union to lower the level of military assistance it has been
sending to Nicaragua.
   ``We have talked to the Soviets. We have made our views,
publicly as well as privately,'' Fitzwater said. But he also said
``we believe it's very important to have an (U.S.) aid package (for
the Contras) ... as a means of keeping pressure on the
Sandinistas'' to institute Democratic reforms.
   Senate conservatives were voicing some muted criticism of the
agreement, but appeared willing to put the Sandinistas to the test
and wait to see whether pledges of amnesty and political pluralism
are fulfilled.
   ``They've gained something,'' Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said
of the rebels, but added: ``It's an agreement that's shaded on the
bad side... What they're after is a pluralistic government with
human rights, and they have none of that.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said ``a sense of euphoria is not in
order. The Sandinistas promised all of this (the pledges in the
agreement) at the time they took power. I don't believe I've ever
heard of a leopard changing his spots.''
   Helms said the agreement removes the United States, at least for
the moment, from any influential role in Nicaragua. ``We are in a
position of wait and see,'' he said. ``The only improvement is that
the heat will really now be on the Sandinistas to put up or shut
up.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said ``I don't have any real
problems with this agreement if it's kept,'' but he was skeptical
about whether that could occcur.
   ``It's incumbent on us now to find out what other pressure we
can keep on the Sandinistas. We can't afford not to be players. The
end product of what they've agreed to still leaves a Soviet puppet
state in Central America,'' receiving large amounts of weaponry.
   ``That worries me in terms of our relationships with the nations
that surround Nicaragua. I view Nicaragua as being more worrisome
for our future than Cuba.''

   Police and firefighters today agreed to
end their day-and-a-half bout of ``blue flu'' and return to work
after city officials promised to set up a committee to discuss
their salary complaints, a police representative said.
   ``Apparently, the mayor is appointing a committee this afternoon
comprised of members of the City Council,'' said Cpl. Dave Dickens,
adding that the committee would meet with police officers Monday.
   He said police and firefighters would return to work this
afternoon as part of an agreement that included creation of the
committee.
   Mayor Chuck Gardner this morning ordered police and firefighters
to end their sick-out, saying there's a strong possibility those
who refused to return to work would be fired.
   On Thursday, officers ignored similar back-to-work orders from a
circuit judge and the City Council, forcing city officials to call
in state police, shut down two fire stations and declare a civil
emergency.
   This morning, 119 of 144 police officers remained off the job
for the second consecutive day to protest a 2 percent pay raise,
but 30 of 44 firefighters reported for work, said Ed Esposito, a
City Hall aide.
   ``They seem to be recognizing the concern that firefighters who
had been on duty since 8 a.m. Wednesday were exhausted,'' he said,
adding there was no indication the firefighters were ending their
sick-out. Most of the firefighters held over when the job action
began were sent home this morning to rest.
   At a press conference today, Gardner said that Thursday was ``a
grace period, allowing cooler heads to review this situation.''
   ``I believe the last 24 hours have given police and firefighters
enough time to obey the court order and return to work, and in
keeping with uniformed services policy I am ordering all police
personnel to report for duty by 2 p.m. this afternoon, and all fire
personnel to report for duty by 6 p.m.''
   When asked what would happen if the officers remained defiant,
he said there was a ``strong possibility'' that those who ignored
his order would be fired.
   The job action in this state capital of 63,000 people, West
Virginia's largest city, began after city officials announced a 2
percent pay raise for city employees effective July 1. Police and
firefighters say the raise is inadequate.
   Gardner said today he will not meet with police and firefighters
until they return to work, and that there is no money for larger
raises.
   ``Let them come forward and show me where the money is,'' he
said.
   Firefighters and police who return to work today face no
punishment, Gardner said, but must have a doctor's excuse.
   Gardner, appearing on television Thursday night, read a
statement announcing that two fire stations in outlying areas of
the city were being closed temporarily because of manpower
shortages.
   ``At this time I am again asking the police and the firefighters
to return to duty at the earliest time or on their next shift,''
Gardner said on WSAZ-TV.
   Earlier in the day, Gardner _ after declaring a state of
emergency _ warned absent workers that ``if you don't come back to
work, you are in contempt of court.''
   Less than an hour before an emergency city council meeting
Thursday, Kanawha County Circuit Judge Patrick Casey issued a
temporary injunction ordering police and firefighters to return to
duty.
   The order was ignored, with 42 of 44 firefighters not reporting
and about a dozen policemen out on a shift that normally has 16 or
17 officers, Gardner said.
   At most, three patrol cars cruised the city Thursday, police
chief Ed Garnett said. ``We're at skeleton now,'' Garnett said, but
the public was ``helping out quite a bit'' by not making
unnecessary calls to dispatchers.
   In addition, two state police cruisers patrolled Charleston
because of the sick-out, state police Sgt. Don Cook said.
   Two fire trucks were taken out of service Thursday evening
because of a manpower shortage and officials said an additional
fire station could be shut down today if the protest continued.
   The city council Thursday unanimously suspended the city's
sick-leave policy, meaning those who called in sick would have to
have a doctor's excuse to get paid for any additional absences.
   The sick-out had the ``potential effect of rendering the city
unable to maintain public order,'' Gardner told the 26 council
members.
   About 20 police officers' wives picketed City Hall on Thursday.
Passing motorists honked their horns in support, and some _ aware
that patrols were down _ took the opportunity to run red lights.
   Many of the wives denied their husbands were striking. ``Mine is
sick. I don't know about everybody else,'' Vicki Robinson said.
``There's no strike.''
   The 2 percent raise averages $438 per employee annually, mayoral
aide Ed Esposito said. He said the uniformed services got a 3
percent raise in the last fiscal year and raises totaling 8 percent
over the past five years, he said.
   The city budget, approved Monday night, includes appropriations
for 165 policemen, 147 firefighters and 10 paramedics.
   Police salaries range from $18,589 for a patrol officer at three
years to $27,673 for a captain with 20 years' experience.
Firefighters pay ranges from $18,409 for a first-year firefighter
to $27,673 for an assistant fire chief with 20 years' experience.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz today
arranged to meet with two members of the Palestine National Council
and discouraged Americans from traveling to the Israeli-held West
Bank and Gaza.
   The travel advisory cited ``continuing disturbances'' in the
areas. In nearly three months of Palestinian protests, 111
Palestinian Arabs and an Israeli soldier have been killed.
   ``We are not issuing am advisory for Israel itself,'' Phyllis
Oakley, the State Department's deputy spokeswoman, said. ``Israel
is safe for American travel.''
   Shultz will hold the meeting with Edward Said, a professor at
Columbia University, and Ibrahim Abu-Lughud, a professor at
Northwestern University, on Saturday ``to discuss our approach to
the Middle East peace process,'' the announcement said.
   Mrs. Oakley stressed that Said and Abu-Lughud are U.S. citizens.
She said the 13-year-old U.S. policy of not dealing with the
Palestine Liberation Organization remained intact.
   ``There is no change in U.S. policy on negotiating with or
recognizing the PLO,'' she said. ``That policy remains as it has
been since 1975.''
   The council is the legislative arm of the PLO. The brief
announcement identified Said and Abu-Lughud only as ``prominent
Americans with an intimate knowledge of contemporary Middle Eastern
politics.''
   The United States, in persuading Israel to relinquish territory
to Egypt and Syria, promised in 1975 it would not deal with the
PLO, which is committed to dismantling the Jewish state. The pledge
subsequently was incorporated into U.S. law.
   Asked if the PLO had given Said and Abu-Lughud permission to
meet with Shultz, the U.S. official said, ``I have nothing on
that.''
   Mrs. Oakley said Shultz initiated the meeting. ``He will discuss
the Palestinian point of view,'' she said. ``They have an intimate
knowledge of Middle Eastern politics.''
   The travel advisory cautioned Americans to avoid going to the
West Bank and Gaza ``until further notice.'' It said Americans
living there ``should exercise particular caution.''
   The situation in East Jerusalem, which was held by Jordan until
1967 and is now part of Israel's capital, was described as
``unpredictable.'' The advisory said Americans should check with
U.S. diplomats in the city before entering the area.
   ``Under all circumstances, Americans should avoid demonstrations
and other situations that have the potential to lead to violence,''
the advisory said. ``American travelers should carry their U.S.
passports at all times.''
   Moshe Arad, the Israeli ambassador, telephoned M. Charles Hill,
an assistant to Shultz, on Thursday to protest the meeting as a
violation of the pledge.
   Said and Abu-Lughud could not be reached immediately to be asked
what they intended to take up with Shultz and whether they had
sought PLO approval for the meeting.
   Earlier this year, Shultz met here with two Palestinians from
the West Bank and Gaza. Their visit was arranged with Israel's
cooperation.
   Shultz had excluded the PLO from his proposal to open
Arab-Israeli negotiations on May 1. His plan calls for Palestinians
approved by the PLO to participate in a joint delegation with
Jordan.
   During a Mideast shuttle last month, Shultz tried to arrange a
meeting in Jerusalem with 15 Palestinian Arabs. Apparently under
PLO orders, none of them showed up.
   Shultz went to a hotel in east Jerusalem, stood in the floodlit
courtyard and read a statement suggesting the Palestinians were
fearful of working with the United States.
   ``Opportunity knocks loudly on your door,'' he said then. ``Now
is the time to get to work. We have a workable plan, and we are
ready to commit our efforts to it. The time is right, together, to
make decisions of historic proportions.''
   Some 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs live on the West Bank of the
Jordan River and in Gaza, along the Mediterranean. The lands were
held by Jordan and Egypt until they were lost to Israel in the 1967
Six-Day war.

<TEXT>
   The chief of Libya's forces in Chad has
joined a group opposed to Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the opposition
group said Friday.
   The National Front for the Salavation of Libya reported the
defection of Col. Khalifah Abu el-Kassem Haftar, a participant in
Gadhafi's 1969 revolution against the Libyan monarchy, in a
statement distributed to Cairo news agency offices.
   Considered the strongest Libyan exile opposition group, the
National Front's headquarters are in the Egyptian capital.
   Telephone calls to Mohamed Yusef al-Magariaf, the Front's
secretary general and Gadhafi's former Libyan ambassador to India,
went unanswered.
   The Front statement quoted Haftar as saying that hundreds of
Libyan officers in Chad agree on ``the necessity to struggle
together with their brothers in the NFSL ... to save the country
from Gadhafi's terrorist and dictatorial rule.''
   The statement did not indicate where Haftar is or say when he
was supposed to have defected. A National Front spokesman known by
the nom de guerre Abu el-Nour said the man was a prisoner of war in
Chad before his defection.
   Libyan claims to a large zone of northern Chad along their
border have been the object of a long-running war between the two
north African nations. Gadhafi backs rebel forces against the
current central government in N'Djamena.
   If the National Front statements were true, Haftar's defection
apparently would be the first of such a high-ranking officer among
Libyan forces in Chad. Colonel, Gadhafi's rank, is the highest
attainable in the Libyan armed forces.

   Brake failure caused two passenger trains to
collide head-on outside Shanghai, killing 28 people and injuring
99, officials said Friday.
   Among the dead were 27 members of a Japanese high school tour
group.
   The two trains crashed head-on Thursday in a Shanghai suburb,
crushing and derailing several front cars. About 400 rescue workers
were dispatched to the scene.
   The crash injured 99 people, 17 of them seriously, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency quoted officials as saying at a Shanghai news
conference.
   Most of the survivors from the 193-member Japanese tour group
boarded a chartered plane in Shanghai on Friday night to return
home. Dozens of relatives of the Japanese dead and injured,
meanwhile, arrived in Shanghai.
   Xinhua quoted Mu Kaixiang, deputy director of the Shanghai
Railway Administration, as saying the No. 311 train from Nanjing to
Hangzhou tried to halt at a station as scheduled.
   But its brakes failed and it continued 460 feet into the path of
train No. 208 arriving from Changsha. The driver of No. 208 applied
his emergency brakes but was unable to prevent the collision,
Xinhua quoted Mu as saying.
   Both trains were moving slower than 25 mph, he said.
   The Japanese students and teachers were in the two first-class
cars of train No. 311, which were derailed and badly crushed.
   Acting Premier Li Peng sent a telegram to Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita on Friday expressing ``deep sympathy'' to
the families of the Japanese victims.
   Japan's vice minister of foreign affairs, Hamada Takujiro, also
arrived to take charge of arrangements for the Japanese involved,
Xinhua said.
   The school group, which included 11 teachers and 182 students,
had arrived in China on Monday to visit Shanghai and nearby
Hangzhou.
   The nationally televised evening news said rescue workers
labored until 3 a.m. Friday to free passengers trapped in the
crushed cars.
   It showed the baggage car of one train resting partially on top
of the other train's engine and passengers being passed out of
train windows on stretchers.
   The collision, China's fourth fatal train accident this year,
came one day before Li convened a session of the legislature, the
National People's Congress, at which the Railways Ministry is
expected to be reorganized.
   A derailment Jan. 24 killed 88 people, a train collision on Jan.
17 killed 19 and a train fire Jan. 7 killed 34.
   Railways Minister Ding Guangen resigned this month in disgrace
because of the earlier train crashes, and no replacement has been
appointed.

   A jury awarded two nurseries $1.5 million

in a case that could set precedent.
   A circuit jury returned its verdict Thursday night in a trial to
set damages.
   Mallory Horne, representing the state Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services, had argued that $600,000 would be a fair
settlement for the loss of 280,000 trees at Mid-Florida Growers
Inc. and Himrod & Himrod Citrus Nurseries.
   The nurseries had received $248,000 from the state and federal
governments as compensation after their stock was destroyed. That
amount will be deducted from the $1.5 million judgment.
   Richard Polk has a similar suit pending for the destruction of
510,000 trees.
   Statewide, more than 20 million nursery-stock or newly planted
trees were burned after inspectors discovered what they thought was
a virulent strain of incurable citrus canker in August 1984. It
later was found to be a much less threatening form of disease and
some nursery owners sued, claiming the burning unnecessary.
   The Florida Supreme Court determined that state officials acted
properly to protect the state's multibillion-dollar industry, but
ruled that owners should receive full compensation for destroyed
propery.
   Pete Packett, spokesman for the Florida Department of
Agriculture, said Friday he expected the state to appeal.

<HEAD>Police Seize Biggest Haul of Cocaine Ever in Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police seized 880 pounds of cocaine worth
about $45 million and arrested 12 people Friday in what they
described as the largest seizure of the drug in European history.
   Authorities believe the find could be linked to the ``Cartel de
Medellin'' ring of Colombia, the alleged supplier of 80 percent of
the cocaine to the U.S. market, according to Madrid drug
enforcement chief Florentino Gomez.
   Among the suspects arrested in Madrid were four Colombians,
three Ecuadorians and a Spanish woman. The others were not
identified.
   Police on Friday were still gathering the drug hidden inside
prefabricated housing panels inside a warehouse in the Madrid
suburb of Fuenlabrada. The total weight of the seizure could
eventually surpass 880 pounds, Gomez said.
   Gomez said the seizure capped an eight-month investigation.
Authorities made a breakthrough when they tracked a container sent
from Ecuador to the port of Barcelona, which was later trucked east
to the Fuenlabrada warehouse, he said.
   The chief of the National Plan to Combat Drugs, Miguel Solans,
said the drug haul represented a major blow to international drug
traffickers. Mainly South Americans dealers have converted Spain
into a gateway to the European drug market.
   On Nov. 11, British and Dutch drug agents claimed the previous
largest seizure in Europe after they found 550 pounds of cocaine
aboard a Colombian freighter in Britain.

<TEXT>
   An attempt by townspeople to protect
mating salamanders from being killed by cars was thwarted when all
but one of the amphibians ignored tunnels installed for them
beneath a busy street.
   The 50 people who turned out in drizzle Thursday night to watch
the first salamander crossing of the year ended up barricading the
street and carrying about 40 of the yellow-spotted salamanders
across to a breeding pond.
   The animals spend the winter hibernating in woods and try to
reach the pond every spring with the first warm rain.
   Shouts went up when one salamander was discovered crawling along
a fence leading to one of the tunnels under Henry Street. The
salamander made it through in five minutes, 20 seconds, said
Shutesbury teacher Ken Lindsay.
   ``It was an historic event,'' Lindsay said Friday. ``It was the
first salamander to go through a tunnel all on its own.''
   The world's first salamander tunnels were installed after a
public outcry over the amphibians' plight.
   Many salamanders faced certain death when they slithered across
the road. Local naturalist Robert Winston persuaded town selectmen
to close the street last year until all the salamanders, members of
the mole salamander family, made the trek, which usually takes a
week.
   The salamanders are not on the state's endangered species list,
although the Henry Street population is the last in town.
   The three 19-inch-high tunnels were donated by ACO Polymer
Products of Cleveland and installed in November for about $2,000.
Volunteers erected fences in January to guide the salamanders to
the tunnels.
   The fences failed their first test, but townspeople said it was
too early to tell how the whole experiment would fare.
   Lindsay said there were very few salamanders out Thursday night.
   Winston's wife, Janet, said the salamanders may have changed
their usual migration pattern to start at a spot beyond the fence.
   Lindsay said they might have been hibernating between the fence
and the road. Richard Minear, chairman of the board of selectmen,
said the tunnels might not be wet enough for the discriminating
amphibians.
   In any event, the salamanders took townspeople by surprise, said
Mrs. Winston, one of the flashlight-toting helpers at the crossing.
``They came a little sooner than we were quite prepared for,'' she
said.
   The town's superintendent of public works said he hadn't yet
hung the ``Salamander Crossing'' signs designed by Shutesbury
fourth-grader Rachel Mackintosh.

   Faced with a financial crisis,
legislators are on the verge of handing Gov. Buddy Roemer more
power than any Louisiana chief executive has had since the days of
Huey Long.
   Bills nearing passage in a special session would give Roemer
authority to slash spending and close state institutions, and state
agencies would be free to hike fees without public hearing or
legislative review.
   Another bill would permit the state to float bonds to pay off an
operating debt that has grown to $1.3 billion since 1982.
   ``All of them just say `give it to the governor and ' We may as well
have passed just one bill and said the
Legislature is hereby abolished,'' said C.W. ``Bill'' Rlet him
decide.oberts, a
top aide to former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards.
   Roemer took office March 15. Edwards decided to retire after
three terms rather than contest a runoff election against the
former congressman.
   At the beginning of a 10-day special session on Monday, Roemer
said the state was in a ``terrifying financial crisis'' and asked
for temporary authority to slash spending until the Legislature
meets in regular session April 18.
   Roemer said the state faces a $210 mia much less threatening form of
disease and
some nursery owners sued, claiming the burning unnecessary.
   The Florida Supreme Court determined that state officials acted
properly to protect the state's multibillion-dollar industry, but

<HEAD>Ogden YWCA May Lose Charter For Admitting Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OGDEN, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ogden YWCA has been warned that its
national charter may be revoked and a reprimand issued over its
decision to allow men as full members, the organization's director
says.
   However, Director Gaye Littleton said no sanctions by the
national YWCA in New York would force her organization to reverse
its decision.
   ``We're holding fast on this,'' Littleton said. ``We're not
going to rescind our action.''
   ``I became the first woman member of the Ogden Rotary Club
recently,'' Littleton said. ``Wouldn't it be tacky of me to become
the first woman member of Rotary, then tell members of Rotary they
could not belong to the YWCA because they're men?''
   The chapter's members voted unanimously Feb. 23 to extend full
memberships to men. Littleton said she knows of no other among
several thousand YWCAs to admit men.
   Since then, Littleton has been contacted by national officials
and told ``as soon as they receive the official notice of what
we've done, they will begin official action against us.''
   The national executive director of ther YWCA, Gwendoline Baker,
was the only person at the group's headquarters who could comment
but she was out of the office Friday, said her assistant, Lorraine
Papasavas.
   The pending battle comes nearly a year after a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that Rotary Clubs International could not revoke the
charter of local clubs that complied with state laws by extending
memberships to women.
   Since the Ogden YWCA extended full membership to males, about 30
men have joined, bringing total membership to about 400, Littleton
said.
   The private, non-profit agency has numerous community programs,
including literacy classes, a crisis center for battered women,
treatment centers for abused children and pregnant teens and
support groups for divorced or widowed people.
   ``We have about 300 volunteers in this organization and about 75
of them are men,'' Littleton said. ``We couldn't run this
organization without men.''
   The opposition to male membership is based ``on old fears that
men dominate women, that women will defer to men, and that we will
lose control,'' she said. ``But that's old stuff. Nobody dominates
anybody anymore. We're all working together much better _ men and
women _ and the sexes don't have to be afraid of each other
anymore.''

<HEAD>NEA Chief Proposes Creation Of Experimental Districts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the National Education Association
proposed Friday creating at least one experimental district in each
state with no holds barred on school reforms.
   Teachers, parents, school boards, local businesses and others
involved in these 50 districts would have the union's blessings to
``turn their school systems upside down or inside out'' in pursuit
of improvements, said NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell.
   ``What we're proposing will say, `Let's look at everything,'''
she told a news conference.
   Asked if that would extend to merit pay plans, which her 1.85
million-member union has bitterly opposed, Futrell said, ``I can't
imagine that they would do that, but if they decide that's an
experiment that they would like to try and they bring us a
reasonable proposal, we would certainly consider that.''
   Futrell said she will ask her state affiliates to work with
governors, legislators and state education officials to reach a
consensus on designating ``at least one entire school district in
every state as an experimental, living laboratory to fundamentally
restructure America's schools.''
   Bold action is needed to revive a school reform movement that
has started to flag from insufficient funding, she said.
   Her proposal drew qualified praise from a persistent critic of
the NEA, William J. Bennett, the U.S. secretary of education.
   Bennett issued a statement from Houston saying: ``It's rather
ironic to hear a call for reform from the organization that has
done the most to resist meaningful education reforms in recent
years. But if they are serious, it will be a welcome and refreshing
change to have NEA begin supporting real education reform.''
   Futrell's counterpart at the American Federation of Teachers,
Albert Shanker, has already scheduled a speech at the National
Press Club on Thursday to unveil what his union calls ``a new and
practical plan for teachers to begin radically restructuring
America's public schools.''
   The AFT said Shanker will outline ``a proposal that teachers be
able to `opt out' of traditional responsibilities to create, run
and administer innovative `mini-schools' within schools.''
   Bella Rosenberg, an assistant to Shanker, said Futrell's idea
sounded like ``more of the same old thing'' and ``an example of the
top-down kind of reform we and others are trying desperately to get
away from.''
   AFT affiliates in Rochester, N.Y.; Dade County, Fla.; Hammond,
Ind., and Toledo, Ohio, are already embarked on experiments giving
local teachers more say in running schools. Toledo has a peer
review system to improve poor teachers or get them out of the
classroom.
   Futrell also announced the NEA will decide April 28 which
Democratic presidential candidate to endorse, if any. Like most
other unions, it has stayed on the political fence until the
crowded field of candidates sorted itself out.
   Futrell said her experimental school district idea must still be
approved at the NEA's annual convention in New Orleans this July.
But she already got a green light from the NEA's powerful board of
directors and has created a union committee on restructuring.
   ``In these 50 school districts, school employees, working
through their local association, would join with school boards,
parents, civic leaders and business to develop whatever innovative
or creative program they deem appropriate to improve education,''
she said.
   ``Those 50 local communities would be free to turn their school
systems upside down or inside out. They would be free to open their
school doors to 4-year-olds, or end the arbitrary division of class
periods into 50-minute chunks, or experiment with alternatives to
student tracking,'' she said.

   Seven bandits burst into a hospital Friday, disarmed
four guards and took about $565,000 in cash from the payroll
office, police said.
   No injuries were reported in the holdup at the Centro
Traumatologico Hospital.
   Police said they did not exclude the possibility that the
bandits, who were armed with pistols and a submachine gun, were
terrorists seeking cash to finance their activities.
   It was the second holdup at a Rome hospital in two days.
   On Thursday, five gunmen disguised as doctors held up a bank
inside the Santo Spirito hospital and fled with about $685,000 that
had just arrived by armored car to pay employees' salaries.
   Wearing white doctor's jackets, the bandits pistol-whipped a
guard and a radiologist before fleeing on motorscooters, police
said.

<HEAD>USDA Milk Giveaways Coming Back for One Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government distribution of surplus milk to
needy families will resume on a temporary basis in June following a
one-month suspension, the Department of Agriculture announced
Friday.
   ``At this time, we do not know if distribution of non-fat dry
milk can be continued beyond June,'' Assistant Secretary for Food
and Consumer Services John Bode said in a statement.
   USDA announced last month it would suspend milk and cheese
distributions under the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance
Program. USDA officials said the suspension was necessary because
of dwindling inventories of the goods. The program began on orders
from President Reagan in 1981 when surpluses were piling up.
   The suspension announcement had drawn immediate fire from
Capitol Hill.
   Bode said Friday that a new upturn in USDA inventories prompted
the June distribution of 8 million pounds of non-fat dry milk
through local food banks. He said the department would monitor its
inventories ``and keep states informed of availability.''
   ``The same is true for cheese,'' he said. ``If we get more,
we'll give it away.''
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said he was ``pleased that there's an additional
temporary supply for the month, but this does not address the
long-term problem.''
   Leahy has been calling for renewal of the TEFAP program, and he
scheduled a grocery-bagging session in a downtown Washington food
bank on Monday morning in an effort to focus the spotlight on the
hunger issue.
   The food giveaway program has distributed more than 5 billion
pounds of surplus food worth more than $5 billion since 1981, the
department said.
   Seven types of food have been provided: cheese, butter, non-fat
dry milk, honey corn meal, flour and rice.

   The spoils of the drug business went up for
auction, with everything from sweat socks to a white fur coat
available for bidding.
   Hundreds of people showed up Thursday looking for a steal among
about 300 items, worth an estimated $50,000. Up for sale were gold
chains, a motor scooter, a vacuum cleaner and something no one
quite recognized.
   ``Whatever it is, let's go for it,'' said a police department
auctioneer, holding up a metal box with a bunch of long wires
hanging down from the sides.
   It brought $50.
   Proceeds go to the police forfeiture fund, used by the Narcotics
Division, said Lt. Martin Rosenau.
   Nick Rubino of East Detroit plunked down $905 for a heavy gold
necklace.
   ``It's a big silly gold chain,'' he said, adding he hopes to
have it melted down. ``I hope it's worth more than $905.''

<TEXT>
   The toddler who was trapped for 58 hours
in an abandoned well celebrates her second birthday Saturday
without the cameras and reporters that greeted her rescue last fall.
   Jessica McClure and her parents, Reba and Chip, plan a quiet
observance at home, said a spokesman, Pete Snelson of Midland.
   But a controversy between rival associations of rescuers over
telling the tale for televison is far from quiet.
   The rescuers were among more than 200 firefighters, law
enforcement officers, cave explorers, construction workers,
drillers, welders and others who worked for three days to free
Jessica from the 8-inch well shaft.
   ``Personally, I hope it doesn't get to the point where you're
embarrassed to say you were involved in the rescue,'' said Richard
Galle, a caver who assisted at the well site.
   Galle, Odessa's recreation superintendent, handled climbing
harnesses for dusty workers who repeatedly descended a newly dug
parallel shaft and bored horizontally through solid rock to reach
the girl, 22 feet down.
   The two rescuers' groups _ one mostly volunteers and the other
city officials and employees _ are negotiating separately with
producers for a television movie.
   The Jessica McClure Rescuer's Association, a group of more than
30 volunteers, is committed to a movie deal with Los Angeles
producer Larry Spivey, president of Highland Communications Group
Inc. The group has asked all rescuers to join them.
   Kragg Robinson, the association's president, said members have
signed a contract that includes an initial $200,000, plus future
payments, to be divided among the members. Spivey has yet to
negotiate a deal with a network.
   The other group, the McClure Rescue Association, comprises 11
municipal officials and has not yet committed to work with a
producer.
   The rescuers' gatherings started calmly enough. Some, in the
spirit of solidarity and friendship, agreed to meet regularly for
reunions and an informal group was created, said David Lilly, a New
Mexico mining expert.
   Jessica's parents have not yet signed any movie agreements, said
Snelson.
   ``It's a beautiful, heart-warming story'' that needs to be told
in the right way, he said. The McClures are ``appreciative of
everyone and haven't measured one group against the other.''
   Police Cpl. Jim White, a member of the municipal workers' group,
said its members harbor no animosity toward the volunteers'
association.
   ``We just don't agree on movie producers,'' said White.

<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. says it will dismantle a
3.4 million-gallon petroleum storage tank it was building with
18-year-old steel at an Ohio River terminal.
   Ashland stopped construction on the tank Jan. 6, just four days
after a 4 million-gallon tank built with 40-year-old steel
collapsed at its terminal in Jefferson, 27 miles south of
Pittsburgh on the Monongahela River. About 730,000 gallons of
diesel fuel spilled into the Monongahela and Ohio rivers.
   Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum said the company decided to tear
down the tank, which was 90 percent completed, because ``we decided
we didn't want to use a used tank at that location.''
   Dismantling will begin within a week, he said.
   Skinner Tank Co. of Yale, Okla., which erected the failed tank
in Jefferson, was reassembling the tank in Midland. The partially
erected tank, 56.5 feet tall and 100 feet in diameter, is about
1,000 yards from the Ohio River in a tank farm purchased from
Pennzoil Inc. about a year ago, the company said.
   The tank was being constructed with steel from a Shell Oil Co.
tank built in Cincinnati in 1970. It was one of 11 tanks, and one
of two that were to be reconstructed from used steel, Ashland
planned to build at the Midland terminal. Schrum said construction
had not begun on the other tanks.
   ``We still have plans to build a good, first-class terminal in
Midland, but we still haven't totally decided how many tanks we
will build up there,'' he said Thursday.
   Schrum said the company's report on the Jefferson tank collapse,
and one being done at Ashland's expense by the Battelle Institute,
won't be completed for several more weeks.

   A judge ruled that 80 children held by a
masked gunman last month at a private school will not have to
testify at a preliminary hearing next week.
   An attorney for James Harvey Jr., charged with 84 counts of
kidnapping in the daylong ordeal, had sought to subpoena the West
End Christian School pupils for Tuesday's preliminary hearing.
   At a brief hearing Thursday, District Attorney Charles Freeman
accused defense attorney Michael Cornwell of trying to ``create a
circus atmosphere.''
   Cornwell said the prosecutor ``is trying to create a lynch-mob
atmosphere.''
   ``I think some people have concluded that Mr. Harvey is guilty
and all this is a waste of time,'' Cornwell said. ``Thelevision and read
the papers. Everybody knows he's guilty.''
   Harvey is expected to be bound over to a Tuscaloosa County grand
jury at next week's hearing.y saw him on
te
   Harvey and another man, both wearing ski masks, allegedly
entered the Tuscaloosa school Feb. 2 and took the 80 pupils and
four teachers hostage.
   The other man, John Rhodes, gave up a few hours later and
charges eventually were dropped against him when authorities
determined he had been tricked into the abduction.
   Twelve hours after the ordeal began, Harvey laid down his
weapons and was arrested after watching a videotape of Gov. Guy
Hunt signing a phony pcouch-potato economy'' that will be marked by low
unemployment, more savings and rising productivity, economists and
population experts say.
   The dawning of a couch-potato economy is the best thing that
could happen to the United States after years of yuppie splurging,
says Edward Yardeni, the economist who coined the term.
   ``Yuppies are slowing down. We're all getting older, a little
less frivolous,'' Yardeni, 38, director of economics and
fixed-income research for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said
this past week.
   Exhibit No. 1 in Yardeni's case is the shift noted last year in
consumer-spending priorities after the go-go years of 1985 and 1986.
   In 1985, the two fastest-growing segments were brokerage and
investment fees and audio and video equipment.
   In 1986, the leaders were boats and recreational vehicles.
   In 1987, America seemed to turn suddenly sedentary. Books and
maps finished first, followed closely by funeral and burial
expenses.
   The numbers from the Commerce Department may be misleading
because the biggest percentage risers are small segments that
fluctuate widely, but Yardeni is convinced that they tell a story.
   ``I'm not promising you that the transformation definitely
happened in '87,'' but something is afoot, Yardeni said.
   He said the shift could point to an increased savings rate.
``And that should leave room for a boom in exports and a boom in
capital spending. Which is not a bad mix at all.''
   One reason for Japan's extraordinary success is its high savings
rate, which creates a pool of money for investment.
   Trailing behind the American baby boomers is the ``baby-bust''
generation _ the smaller complement of workers that is entering the
work force now.
   There are too few qualified baby busters to fill all the
entry-level jobs. But Yardeni optimistically sees a positive side
to that: It will force business to find ways to automate more, he
says, increasing the nation's productivity.
   Yardeni's ideas are supported by others, including Cheryl
Russell, editor-in-chief of American Demographics magazine in
Ithaca, N.Y.
   As baby boomers settle down, they are beginning to put aside
money for their children's education and their own retirement, Ms.
Russell said.
   But baby boomers will still be spending, too, something that is
good news for producers of consumer goods.
   ``Baby boomers are entering their peak earnings years, so they
will be able to spend more and save more at the same time,'' Ms.
Russell said.
   In spite of the free-spending reputation of the young, Ms.
Russell said, households headed by people aged 35 and over lead
their juniors in every broad category of spending except two:
alcohol and rented dwellings.
   The mix of spending is what is changing. Couch potatoes spend
less money on movie tickets, more on things like VCRs. And, of
course, couches.
   The changing habits of the nation are more than a myth. The
Roper Organization last year reported a poll finding that more than
half of people over 30 prefer doing things at home, while more than
half of people under 30 prefer doing things outside the home.
   The median age in the United States is rising, Ms. Russell
notes, and it has just passed 30.
   ``Everyone's tired,'' said Thomas Miller, 30, editor of the
Public Pulse, a Roper newsletter. ``Some peole call it the
cocooning phenomenon. Some people call it the couch-potato economy.
We think it's mainly exhaustion.''

<HEAD>State `Rainy Day' Funds Usually Are Undernourished or Empty,
Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Thirty-six states have established ``rainy
day'' funds as a hedge against economic downturns, although seven
states have put no money in them and most of the rest haven't put
in enough to deal with serious financial troubles, a report issued
Friday said.
   Two of the states, Alaska and Wyoming, both suffering from the
drop in energy prices, actually have drawn upon those reserves to
avoid deep spending cuts and to keep their budgets balanced, the
report said.
   ``That proves the funds are working,'' said Raymond Scheppach,
executive director of the National Governors' Association.
   The association, along with the National Association of State
Budget Officers, put together the report on the financial condition
of the 50 states, ``Fiscal Survey of the States.''
   In general, the report found that most states tightened their
budget belts last year and are reluctant to start major new
programs this year because of uncertainty about the economy.
   States such as Louisiana and West Virgina are facing tough
financial times because of their reliance on the troubled energy
industry. But the majority of states are in sound health, the
report said.
   Still, that figure belies the fact that most states are close to
the financial edge. The report found that the majority of states
will end the year with only small budget balances. Those balances
are expected to fall to 1.5 percent of total expenditures at the
end of next fiscal year, the lowest level since the recession of
1983, when it was 1.3 percent.
   California and New Jersey, both with booming economies, are
among the handful of states expecting to end the next fiscal year
with large balances. California is projecting a $1.1 billion
balance and New Jersey, $231 million.
   Louisiana, on the other hand, is the only state forecasting a
deficit at the end of next fiscal year _ an estimated $731 million.
   The report also found that some states are putting money aside
into contingency funds instead of counting unspent dollars as
end-of-the-year balances. Such reserves are a relatively recent
phenomenon, formed to buffer state finances from the disruptions of
an uneven economy, the report said.
   But the funds, overall, are small. At the end of last fiscal
year, the reserves totaled $2 billion, or just under 1 percent of
expenditures, the report said. The amount of money in the reserves
is expected to increase slightly to $2.3 billion at the end of this
fiscal year, but that still will equal just 1 percent of
expenditures.
   ``Clearly,'' the report said, ``small reserves can help relieve
less serious fiscal conditions, but states will still be unprepared
for an extended economic downturn.''
   Seven of the states have yet to put money into their reserves:
Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, the
report said.
   The other 29 states that have established such reserves are
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana (which refers to its program as a
deficit elimination fund), Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming.
   New Jersey and Hawaii are considering creating a ``rainy day''
fund.
   Most states expect little fallout from last October's stock
market collapse, although Florida, Washington, Tennessee and New
York are planning for revenue losses.
   The report found that the economic picture generally differs by
region, with New England in a strong financial position. One
measure of its strength was its unemployment rate, which averaged
3.4 percent in 1987, far below the national rate of 6.2 percent.
   The Mideast also boasts a strong economy, while recessions in
the Midwestern farm states and Western energy states seem to have
bottomed out, the report said. In the South, the economic picture
is mixed, with some states, like Florida, North Carolina and
Virginia, experiencing strong growth and Louisiana, West Virginia
and Kentucky facing economic hard times.

   Rep. James Howard, D-N.J., chairman of the
House Public Works Committee, died today, a day after suffering a
heart attack while playing golf, his office said.
   Howard, 60, a 22-year House veteran, collapsed Thursday on a
suburban Maryland golf course, according to his office. His staff
said he suffered a heart attack and cardiac arest.
   Doctors labored for nearly two hours to start the Spring Lake
Heights, N.J., lawmaker breathing on his own after the attack .
Howard had not regained consciousness since he was stricken.
   Howard, who had suffered two previous heart attacks, was revived
by doctors at Montgomery General Hospital in Olney, Md. He was then
rushed by helicopter to the sophisticated cardiac unit at the
Hospital Center here.
   A former Wall Township schoolteacher and principal, Howard has
been in Congress since 1965. He is the second most senior member of
the New Jersey congressional delegation after Rep. Peter Rodino,
who has announced he will not run for re-election this year.

<HEAD>Pope Emphasizes Celibacy In Message To Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II stressed the value of
celibacy in a letter sent to priests worldwide and released by the
Vatican on Friday.
   ``The analogy between the church and the Virgin Mother has a
special eloquence for us, who link our priestly vocation to
celibacy, that is, to making ourselves eunuchs for the sake of
heaven,'' the pope said in his annual Holy Week message to priests.
   In the past, the pope has washed the feet of 12 men in a Holy
Thursday service to re-enact Christ's last supper with his
apostles, who are considered the first priests of the Roman
Catholic church.
   Telling priests that their lives are the ``equivalent'' of
``spiritual fatherhood'' because the church has a special
relationship with the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, the pope
wrote: ``On Holy Thursday we need to deepen once again this
mysterious truth of our vocation....''
   The pope urged priests to turn to Mary for guidance in keeping
their vocation, saying, ``it is necessary that our priestly choice
of celibacy for the whole of our lives should also be placed within
her heart.''
   John Paul encouraged priests to ``seek also a proper
relationship with women.'' As examples, he cited how Jesus showed
compassion to an adultress who was on the verge of being stoned by
a crowd. He asked the spectators, according to the Gospel of John,
``Let him who is without sin ... be the first to cast a stone upon
her.''
   He noted also that Jesus first conveyed the ``Easter good news
of his resurrection'' to women who had come to his tomb.
   ``By reason of his vocation and service, the priest must
discover in a new way the question of the dignity and vocation of
women both in the church and in today's world.''
   The pope did not elaborate on what a church vocation could mean
for women, who are barred from the priesthood.

<HEAD>World Jewish Congress Calls Austrian Reparations To Jews
`Desecration''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the World
Jewish Congress, on Friday condemned the payment voted by Austria's
parliament to compensate victims of Nazism as ``a desecration.''
   The decision to grant between $200 and $400 to each victim
``represents a desecration of the memory of the victims of the
Holocaust at the very moment of Austria's reflection on the 50th
anniversary of its union with Nazi Germany,'' Bronfman said.
   The parliament in Vienna voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to pay a
one-time sum of $4 million to victims of Nazism.
   Some 68,000 Austrian Jews died in Nazi concentration camps
during World War II, and more than 120,000 others were incarcerated
in camps or fled the country. In all, the Nazis exterminated some 6
million Jews.
   Bronfman's statement noted that the Austrian decision was in
marked contrast to West Germany's 1952 agreement to compensate the
victims of Nazism for life with monthly reparation payments.
   The World Jewish Congress, based in New York, has been at the
forefront of a two-year campaign to expose the Nazi past of
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim. ``The recent attention focused on
Kurt Waldheim's Nazi past has exploded the long-held myth that
Austria was a victim of Nazi persecution rather than its very
willing collaborator,'' Bronfman said.
   A team of international historians found that Waldheim was
implicated in Nazi persecution while serving as an officer in the
German army during World War II.

   President Reagan said today he still thinks
fired national security council aide Oliver L. North is a hero and
he does not believe any of the Iran-Contra criminal defendants
committed a crime.
   Fielding questions after making a speech to young people
representing the Center for the Study of the Presidency, Reagan
said he thought that North, along with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and other defendants, will be acquitted
of charges brought against them in a federal grand jury indictment.
   Reagan said he could not understand why the arms-to-Iran
initiative had become his administration's worst political scandal.
   ``I still think Ollie North is a hero,'' Reagan said when asked
if he was considering a pardon for his former aide, who retired
last week from the U.S. Marine Corps.
   Earlier this week, North and Poindexter, along with arms dealers
Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, pleaded innocent to federal
conspiracy and theft charges in connection with the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane had earlier
pleaded guilty to reduced charges stemming from the arms-to-Iran
deal.
   After telling his audience that the subject of pardons is
``something I can't discuss now,'' Reagan added:
   ``I just have to believe that they're going to be found innocent
because I don't believe they're guilty of law-breaking of any
kind.''
   Reagan has said on past occasions that he did not believe any
laws were broken in the affair, which came to public light in early
November 1986.
   On Nov. 25, 1986, Reagan appeared in the White House press room
to announce that North had been fired and that Poindexter had
resigned.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III came onto the podium a few
moments later to announce that the administration had uncovered
information indicating that proceeds from the arms sales to Tehran
had been diverted to the Iran-Contra rebels.

<HEAD>Five Years Later, FDA Guidelines on Elderly Drugs Unenforceable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has yet to enact guidelines
ensuring that manufacturers of new drugs test their medications on
the elderly, a Senate panel was told Friday.
   Medical experts appearing before the Senate Special Committee on
Aging said the guidelines, along with better labeling, were keys in
curbing a ``disturbing frequency'' of harmful drug reactions among
people over 60.
   On June 28, 1983, Mark Novitch, then Food and Drug
Administration deputy commissioner, told the Committee on Aging
that the agency was developing standards to make sure elderly
patients were included in tests of new drugs for ailments common to
senior citizens.
   But the guidelines remain unpublished, FDA Commissioner Frank E.
Young said in a statement the Senate panel released Friday.
   ``Five years later, the FDA is still dragging its feet,'' said
Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., the committee's ranking Republican.
   Young said the FDA had not ignored the standards, but rather had
been circulating them among drug companies in draft form for
comments and fine-tuning.
   ``The guidelines are already being implemented in that the
pharmaceutical industry is using them,'' Young said.
   But physician Jerry Avorn of the Harvard Medical School told the
panel that without final guidelines, there has been ``great
variabiity in the eagerness with which drug companies have sought
out the elderly in the investigational stages of a new drug.''
   Avorn said there was a ``disturbing frequency'' of adverse drug
reactions among senior citizens.
   Young did not appear in person for questioning, saying in a
letter to committee chairman John Melcher, D-Mont., that he was
notified two weeks ago and did not have had adequate time to
prepare.
   In 1986, people 60 and over accounted for at least 39 percent of
4,481 hospitalizations due to adverse reactions from medication,
according to FDA figures.
   But researchers have estimated the number of such
hospitalizations might actually be much higher. Stereotypes of the
elderly as confused, depressed, weak or diarrheic often cause
health professionals to miss drug-related ailments, said William
Simonson, associate professor of pharmacy at Oregon State
University.
   ``Since the most common manifestations of adverse drug reactions
in the elderly are precisely the same symptoms of this unfair
stereotype, professionals who believe that aging is synonymous with
deterioration of physical and mental function often overlook
medications as the cause of their patients' deterioration,''
Simonson said.
   Simonson said the FDA was not being tough enough in ensuring
that geriatric-specific information appeared on labels.
   FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said in an interview that labeling
would improve as better information became available about specific
medications.
   Two other witnesses, Wilda Henry of Golden Gate, Fla., and Ann
Little of Cray, Tenn., said their mothers had suffered needlessly
because physicians had prescribed drugs that produced harmful
reactions.
   Little said doctors had recommended over-the-counter antacids,
laxatives and painkillers for her mother, Donnis Ware. More
importantly, she said, her mother's medicine cabinet was a
``mini-drug store'' of 14 prescription drugs, including medication
to strengthen the heartbeat and regulate rhythm, control blood
pressure and increase urine flow.
   She testified that her mother had been hospitalized after a
January 1986 overdose left her ``sprawled and lifeless,'' and later
confused.
   Ms. Henry said her mother, whom she declined to name, had become
``a vegetable'' from legal drug use.

   Indiana's Dublin may not be on the travel
itinerary of many foreign visitors, but it's a must stop for six
Irish firefighters touring the United States in a motor home.
   Dublin, which has about 1,000 residents, is one of eight Dublins
on the firefighters' itinerary. So far, they've been to Dublins in
North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia and
Kentucky.
   After leaving Dublin, Ind., they planned to head east to Dublin,
Ohio.
   Rex A. Snyder, president of the Dublin Fire Department, said the
Irishmen were expected to arrive Saturday, exchange gifts and then
attend a reception.
   The locals hope the Irishmen won't be too disappointed, however,
when they learn that the naming of Dublin had nothing to do with
the Irish city of the same name.
   Clarence Bryant, 71, the unofficial historian of Dublin, Ind.,
said there are two stories about the town's name.
   One school believes the town was called Dublin because travelers
along the National Road, the nation's first interstate, had to
``double'' their teams to get through a swampy area and up a hill
near Dublin.
   The other story was that so many pioneers used the National Road
to head west that it was necessary to have a two-room inn _ a
double inn _ to accommodate them all, Bryant said.

   A giant quilt hand-sewn into the shape of
North Dakota in honor of the state's 100th birthday received rave
reviews from about 500 people who inspected it in stocking feet.
   ``I'm proud of how it turned out,'' said Leona Tennyson, 73, who
coordinated the quilt's construction. ``A lot of people put a lot
of time and effort into it. I think it's a good, clean way to
celebrate our centennial.''
   The quilt, which covered the entire floor of the Civic Memorial
Auditorium, was measured Thursday night at 123 feet, 10 inches at
its widest point and 75 feet, 9 inches deep.
   The measurements were taken by members of the North Dakota
Centennial Commission, which hopes the quilt will be confirmed as
the world's largest by the Guinness Book of World Records.
   Guinness lists a Belgian quilt sewn in 1982 and measuring 69
feet, 6 inches by 99 feet, 5 inches and sewn as its current record.
   The centennial quilt contains 1,360 four-inch-square township
blocks, many with carefully crafted symbols of the local landscape,
natural resources and history.
   ``It's hard to imagine putting this all together with some of
the detail that went into the work,'' said Fargo Mayor Jon
Lindgren, who joined some 500 other spectators in viewing the quilt.
   Most of the spectators walked on the quilt in stocking feet to
locate familiar landmarks or family farmsteads. Some knelt on all
fours to get a closer look.
   More than 7,000 volunteers around the state worked on the
project, which took 23 months to complete, according to Ms.
Tennyson, who teaches arts and crafts in Antler, along the North
Dakota-Canada border.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Alerting Supporters To Ideological Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government and
the Contra rebels each claimed on Friday that its own military
pressure helped force the other to yield to a cease-fire plan.
   The Sandinistas, in their newspaper Barricada, called on
citizens to prepare for ideological warfare to defend the ruling
party against the Contras. The Contras hinted that if peaceful
measures don't bring about democratic reforms, they are prepared
take up arms again.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman said there were no reports of
combat on Friday, five days after the two sides agreed to suspend
offensive operations.
   The temporary truce began at the start of three days of talks
that ended with the signing of the plan Wednesday night. Under the
pact, guns will remain silent until June 1, when a permanent
cease-fire is to take effect.
   In addition to its regular edition, Barricada distributed a
special four-page edition Friday praising the pact that outlines
steps to end the war, which has lasted more than six years.
   Barricada's regular edition said that with the agreement, the
war will take on a new phase.
   ``On an internal political level, this means the incorporation
of pressure groups, that even though disarmed, continue to be armed
ideologically against the popular power and its conquests,'' it
said in an editorial.
   ``This implies that while the warlike battles lessen or stop,
the fight enters a new phase of political-ideological battles.
   ``The people should be ready for the new step to reach total
peace, the continuation and the strengthening of the revolution and
the power of the Sandinistas,'' it added.
   It ran a front-page caricature of President Reagan dressed as a
magician and reaching into an empty high-top hat. The magician's
rabbit, with the word ``Sapoa'' written on its chest, sat on
Reagan's head.
   The cease-fire talks were held at the customs post outside the
border village of Sapoa, 90 miles south of the capital.
   Jorge Rosales, a Contra spokesman in Miami, said the Sandinistas
signed the cease-fire agreement ``because of the pressure _
military and political _ put on them by the (Nicaraguan)
Resistance,'' as the rebels are formally known.
   ``The Resistance has been proposing this type of agreement since
1983 but the only response we had from them was insults,'' he said.
   But Rosales indicated that if democracy is not reached with the
cease-ire agreement that the Contras would renew their armed fight.
   ``If we can't do it peacefully, if the Sandinsitas do not want
to achieve democracy, then the reasons Nicaraguans took up arms
will still be there,'' he said.
   The rebels' Radio Liberacion quoted Contra leader Adolfo Calero
as saying ``the signed truce doesn't mean we have abandoned our
fight (for democracy) in Nicaragua.''
   ``Our first way is peaceful, but this does not exclude other
means if we are obligated to do so,'' he said.
   Contra sources have indicated that Congress' rejection of new
aid to them in February was the major reason for signing the
agreement. The other was that the Sandinistas reportedly told the
rebels the talks were the last chance to end the war.
   The Sandinistas are banking on the Reagan administration's lame
duck status continuing to thwart its efforts to get new Contra aid.
   At the same time, they made some concessions to reach the
agreement, which could ease severe internal problems that revolve
around the draft, economic policies and the chronic shortages of
food and basics.
   The Contras have been backed by the United States since 1981 in
their fight to oust the Sandinistas, who came to power in a popular
revolutionary war. Government opponents say they promised democracy
and delivered Marxism.
   Under the cease-fire agreement, the government will grant a
gradual political amnesty and full press freedoms. The Contras may
receive only non-lethal aid and it must be distributed by a neutral
organization. All political exiles can return.
   A United Nations delegation went to the border with Nicaragua
for a second day Friday. It was invited by the Sandinistas to prove
its troops had not crossed into Honduran territory during an
eight-day offensive that ended March 16 to rout Contras from base
camps.
   Defense sources said Thursday the Sandinista army has pulled
patrols from mountainous jungle regions in war zones to places
where there are less likely to be clashes with the Contras.
   The Reagan administration and the Honduran government have cited
an incursion by 2,000 Sandinista as the reason for sending U.S.
troops into Honduras last week.
   Nicaraguan soldiers in the border region of thick jungle,
mountains and a maze of rivers indicated they had crossed the Coco
River dividing the two nations.
   The Sandinista offensive pushed about 1,800 rebels back into
Honduras, according to the government. Military sources indicated
that the low number of battlefield deaths, put at 92 by the
Sandinista army, did not mark a victory for government troops.

   Jesse Upchurch knew little about apocalyptic
imagery in the Bible and cared less about satanic symbols until the
new owners of her lakefront luxury building said it was no longer
666 North Lake Shore Drive.
   ``I never knew it had satanic connotations until one night when
I was watching `The Omen' on television,'' Ms. Upchurch said,
referring to the 1976 movie in which a boy named Damien has the
numbers ``666'' on his scalp.
   ``When I saw that,'' she continued, ``I said to myself, `Isn't
that amazing? He has our address on his head.' It actually made me
feel kind of proud.''
   The building's new owners and management felt differently. In a
March 1 letter, they notified commercial leaseholders and occupants
of the nearly 400 residential units that as of May 1, the building
will be known as Lake Shore Place at 680 North Lake Shore Drive.
   Spokesmen for the owner, a Chemical Bank of New York subsidiary,
and the local management company, Golub & Co., say the address
change had nothing to do with the devil.
   They say their intent was to disassociate the building from a
spate of financial problems that befell its previous owner, a New
York real estate developer who bought the building in 1979 and lost
a mortgage foreclosure battle with the bank last year.
   ``It certainly wasn't us who raised this devil thing,'' said
Michael Schramm, executive vice president of Golub & Co.
   Some Chicagoans have taken to calling the building the
Mark-of-the-Beast Building or the Devil's Building, apparently in
light-hearted reference to passages from the book of Revelation in
the New Testament.
   The book tells of a beast with two horns like a lamb that arose
from the earth and caused every person to receive its mark on the
right hand or the forehead. ``Let him that hath understanding count
the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his
number is six hundred threescore and six,'' according to Revelation
13:18.
   Ms. Upchurch said a supervisor in the city department that
approved the address change told her the owners specifically
mentioned that ``666 refers to the devil.''
   If the owner's motive is open to debate, the inconvenience the
name change will cause many tenants is not.
   ``They're fighting mad and ... we're talking about wealthy
people, not the kind of people you'd expect to pick this kind of
fight,'' said Ms. Upchurch, 36, who makes her living writing and
recording commercial jingles with her husband.
   ``I'd just bought a year's supply of client forms and checks:
10,000 envelopes with the wrong address were delivered four days
before we were notified,'' said Sharon Cooper Wottrich, owner and
president of A-Plus Talent Agency in the building.
   The tenants have collected $1,600 thus far and retained an
attorney about making a legal challenge, Ms. Upchurch said.
   The final blow to some tenants isn't even the name change. It's
the new _ some say stuffy _ moniker of Lake Shore Place.
   ``It's absolutely pretentious,'' said Zacharias Rosner, another
leader of the tenant uprising. ``It's like painting a Rolls-Royce
orange.''

   A U.S.-built rocket
carrying a satellite with Italian, West German and U.S. scientific
experiments was launched from an Indian Ocean platform off the
coast of East Africa on Friday night.
   The satellite will orbit the Earth on a yearlong mission to
study the lower atmosphere.
   The Scout rocket, a four-stage, solid-fuel booster, rose in a
plume of fire and smoke into a cloudless sky beneath a quarter moon.
   The launch at 10:55 p.m. came 12 hours after an original
daylight launch was postponed. Weather forecasters had predicted a
thunderstorm, which did not materialize.
   Aboard the 522-pound satellite was equipment from NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland to measure the electric field
outside the craft.
   Another experiment from the University of Texas will measure hot
gases and ion winds surrounding the spacecraft.
   The Italian space agency sent a device designed to measure drag
forces on the orbiting satellite, and the West German space agency
sent equipment to measure solar ultraviolet radiation and radiation
of interplanetary and intergalactic origin.
   The satellite, which will be monitored from a control room in
Rome, will make a complete loop around the Earth, above the
equator, every 100 minutes.
   Friday night's launch was the first from the Italian-run San
Marco Equatorial Range since 1974.
   The range, 90 miles north of the port city of Mombasa, was
established in 1965 and has been the site of eight previous
launches, all of them involving Scout rockets.
   The University of Rome operates the range. Friday's launch was
conducted in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   The San Marco platform, named for the patron saint of
navigators, is three miles offshore and similar to those used in
offshore drilling.
   The Scout rocket is one of the most reliable ones used by NASA.
Friday night's launch was the 53rd success out of 54 attempts in
the past 20 years, NASA officials said.
   The launch had been postponed from last week because of
mechanical problems.

   Soldiers opened fire Friday
when a mob attacked a school they had occupied, killing two Arabs,
and others stormed a mosque to pursue youths throwing stones,
according to Arab and army reports.
   Witnesses and Israel radio said 13 Palestinians were wounded at
the school in Tarqumia, which was being converted into a temporary
army headquarters.
   In nearby Hebron, soldiers shot at young Arabs on the roof of Al
Haras mosque who pelted them with rocks and raised the outlawed
Palestinian flag after midday prayers. Hospital officials said four
Arabs were wounded.
   About 30 soldiers stormed the mosque, yanked down the flags and
lined up dozens of teen-agers against a wall. The army said 50 were
arrested.
   Troopers stormed Hebron's Alia Hospital later and arrested six
young Arabs who barricaded themselves on the roof, flinging stones
at soldiers and passing cars, the army reported.
   According to U.N. figures, 111 Palestinians have been killed
since violence began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
Israel has occupied since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East war. One Israeli soldier has been killed.

<HEAD>Family Evicted From Tent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Varryl Thomas says her family had two
choices: ``It was either come here to St. Tammany and live in a
tent or stay in New Orleans and live in the streets.''
   St. Tammany gave the family an unexpected third choice _ to move
the tent because it was violating sanitation and building codes.
   However, the deputy who ordered them to move put them in touch
with a church, which is helping them find a home.
   ``We have no relatives around here and didn't know anybody,''
Mrs. Thomas said. ``We had no place to go. My husband's disabled
and I don't have a job. If it wasn't for the churches, we would be
some pitiful people.''
   The Thomases' problems began in New Orleans about a month ago,
when the house they were living in was sold. They'd been living
rent-free in exchange for watching the property, Mrs. Thomas said.
   ``We didn't have enough money to rent a new house,'' she said.
``Rent there is about $175. Plus you have to have that much more
for a damage deposit and more money for utility deposits.''
   They took their $277 monthly welfare check and every penny they
could scrape up and made a $200 down payment on a 75-by-125-foot
lot in a subdivision near Madisonville.
   Last weekend, they loaded their belongings in plastic garbage
bags, put them on a small pickup truck and drove across the
Causeway to their new lot. Several of the bags blew into Lake
Pontchartrain on the way over.
   ``That didn't help matters,'' Larry Thomas said.
   Their 9-by-12-foot tent made it, however. The family improvised
an outhouse from a blue tarpaulin over a hole in the ground.
   The couple and their children _ Benjamin, 4, Alaster, 5, and
Luwana, 6 _ planned to live there until they could afford to build
a small house.
   ``We didn't know we weren't supposed to put up a tent on the
lot,'' Mrs. Thomas said. ``We were told the only thing you couldn't
put on the lot was a trailer.''
   After learning the family's plight, the St. Tammany Parish
sheriff's deputy who ordered them to move called St. Anselm
Catholic Church in Madisonville. Deacon Philip Baham put the family
up in a motel for the rest of the weekend and found them a house in
Covington, Mrs. Thomas said.
   The church paid $100 for a month's rent and the Covington Food
Bank and the Vincentian Center in Covington gave the family food,
said food bank manager Beverly Sharp.
   Mrs. Thomas said the family paid $200 down and $125 in closing
costs for the $9,500 lot. The 17-year mortgage was to be paid at
$95 a month.
   ``We were going to try to pay it out of our welfare check, I
guess. And I was hoping to find a job,'' Mrs. Thomas said.
   Sharp said the Vincentian Center is trying to find a job for
Mrs. Thomas, who has worked as an auto mechanic.
   ``But I'll do anything at all,'' Mrs. Thomas said. ``I'm not
choosy about a job. I went to three places today, but they didn't
have any openings.''

<HEAD>`Caveman' With Toy Gun Arrested In Robberies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shy ``caveman'' with a toy gun and a
man who allegedly drove him to stickups and ordered him to hide in
the cave are suspected of at least 16 robberies, police said Friday.
   Joseph E. Steffani, 24, of Oakland, was lured from his cave by
undercover officers who promised him cigarettes and a hot meal,
then arrested him, said Sgt. Robert Chenault.
   ``He looked like Grizzly Adams without the long beard,'' said
Chenault. ``He wore an old ragged jacket, dirty pants and sneakers
and he smelled pretty bad.''
   Kenneth Hawtin, 37, of El Cerrito, who Steffani claims took him
to the robberies and told him to stay in the cave, also was
arrested for the robberies that netted a total of about $1,500
since March 7, Chenault said.
   ``Hawtin would drive Steffani to the places they would rob,
convenience stores, florist shops, ice cream parlors and liquor
stores, easy places to hit,'' Chenault said. ``Steffani would walk
in, throw a bag on the counter, say `This is a stickup,' show the
gun in his belt and tell them to fill the bag.''
   No one was hurt in any of the holdups.
   ``We didn't believe it at first when we heard a caveman was
pulling these robberies,'' Chenault said. ``But it turned out to be
true.''
   In an apparent suicide attempt, Hawtin stuck a key into an
electrical outlet in a police interview room Thursday after
admitting his involvement in the robberies, Chenault said. He was
knocked unconscious and was hospitalized overnight for observation.
   Steffani and Hawtin also were being treated for heroin and
cocaine addiction, Chenault said. Steffani told police he's been
addicted to the tranquilizer Valium since he was 14 and was afraid
to be around people without the drug.
   Hawtin and Steffani split the money from the robberies, Chenault
said, and apparently used it to buy drugs.
   Police said Hawtin befriended Steffani last Christmas and lived
with him in El Cerrito until last week, when he took Steffani to
the cave above the tiny town of Canyon.
   Only a few friends knew of Steffani's hiding place, said Sgt.
Dan Mercado. They and Hawtin would drive to the area with food and
supplies and honk their horns.
   Steffani would come out of his hiding place, see who it was and
either ``get the things or run back into the bushes and hide,''
Mercado said.
   Mercado said police were tipped off by an informant. Undercover
officers went to arrest Steffani late Wednesday night and honked
their horn. At first, Mercado said, all the officers could see was
``eyes in the bushes.''
   Steffani eventually gave up without a struggle. Hawtin was
arrested the next day, and a plastic replica handgun allegedly used
in the robberies was found in his car, Chenault said.

   The Senate, voting 92-0, urged President
Reagan on Friday to increase U.S. economic pressure against
Panamanian military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega as part of a
campaign to drive him from office.
   The unanimous vote was intended to demonstrate Noreiga has lost
all U.S. support.
   The non-binding resolution also urged the White House to
consider ``a comprehensive package of emergency financial and other
economic assistance'' to help a democratic successor government
rebuild Panama's economy.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said, ``We have been aware of the Senate resolution for
days and consider it to be completely complementary to U.S. policy
in Panama.''
   ``The impression in all our minds is that Noriega must go,''
said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   ``He will go, and this will help him down the slippery slope,''
Pell said.
   ``To Gen. Noriega, we say step aside now, while you still have
the chance _ for your own sake and for your family''s future,''
said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a principal sponsor of the
resolution.
   The resolution declared that Noriega's military rule and his
alleged involvement in large-scale international drug running and
money laundering represent ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United
States.''
   But senators stressed that any action the United States takes
against Noreiga is in response to the direct request of President
Eric Arturo Devalle, who was ousted as Panama's chief executive on
Feb. 25 after trying unsuccessfully to remove Noriega as head of
the Panamanian Defense Force.
   ``This battle is going to be won or lost by the Panamanian
people,'' Kennedy said. ``But I think it is important that in this
struggle they know where the United States stands.''
   Several senators urged Noriega to reconsider his refusal of a
Justice Department offer not to seek his extradition for trial on
U.S. narcotics-trafficking charges if he gives up power and goes
into exile in Spain.
   ``Noriega needs to know that offer is not good forever _ and
that he will not be free to pursue his sordid activities without
fear of paying the consequences,'' said Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn.
   ``If he thinks this is the end of it _ if he feels this is all
we are going to do _ he'd better think again,'' said Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C. ``This is a man who is a symbol for destroying
liberty.''
   Among the options available to the United States is the
imposition of a total trade embargo against Panama, a step the
administration has resisted in favor of a more measured,
incremental approach.
   Many members of Congress originally called for such action
before joining forces behind the resolution approved Friday.
   After two federal grand juries in Florida charged Noriega with
multimillion-dollar drug trafficking and money laundering,
President Reagan cut off the flow of U.S. dollars to Panama.
   Panama uses dollars as its own currency and the move paralyzed
the Panamanian banking system.
   Before meeting in the Oval Office with Dominican President
Joaquin Balaguer on Friday, Reagan was asked whether Noriega might
seek exile in the Dominican Republic.
   ``No,'' he replied. ``That's not far enough.''
   Reagan, asked about the Senate resolution at a departure
ceremony for Balaguer, said, ``We're considering everything, but I
can't take any questions.''
   Balaguer said in an interview with the Voice of America that he
would grant asylum to Noriega if asked.
   Meanwhile, the federal Agency for International Development has
agreed to release $250,000 in emergency funds to buy food for the
poor in Panama.
   The food will be purchased in Panama if it is available and
distributed through Caritas, a Roman Catholic relief agency, said
AID spokesman Jim Kunder.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There will be no organized union boost behind
a single candidate in Saturday's Democratic caucuses in Michigan, a
state where union members can wield more clout than almost anywhere
else.
   While national labor leaders are assuming Michael Dukakis will
be the eventual nominee, they are prevented from endorsing him by
what appears to be growing rank-and-file support for Jesse Jackson,
who has gotten more union votes than any of the other candidates in
primaries so far. Richard Gephardt also has considerable union
support.
   None of the Democratic candidates appears to have won the hearts
_ or votes _ of a majority of the state's 750,000 rank-and-file
union workers, nearly half of them members of the United Auto
Workers.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland has held out the possibility of
an endorsement before the Democratic National Convention in July if
it appears that two-thirds of the labor federation's 14.2 million
members have agreed on a favorite.
   So far they haven't. Exit polls from the March 8 Southern
primaries showed Jackson holding the greatest support among union
members at 37 percent, followed by Dukakis at 25 percent.
   ``There's not going to be an endorsement before the covention,''
Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr, who also
is an AFL-CIO vice president, said this week.
   Despite UAW President Owen Bieber's known affection for
Gephardt, the union itself has carefully maintained an official
position of neutrality in accord with AFL-CIO guidelines.
   So have the other big unions in Michigan _ the Teamsters with
72,000 members, the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees with 60,000, the Service Employees with 27,000
and the United Steel Workers with 24,000.
   But that ``neutrality'' by the international unions hasn't
prevented their former leaders and the hundreds of local union
officers in Michigan from taking sides.
   Bill Marshall, former president of the Michigan state labor
federation, endorsed Gephardt on Friday. Former UAW President Doug
Fraser endorsed Dukakis earlier this month.
   ``It's kind of schizophrenic, said Jon Ogar, a spokeman for the
Michigan State Labor Federation. ``Most of the unions here have
people in everybody's camp.''
   AFSCME, for example, is running separate sets of
get-out-the-vote phone banks on behalf of both Dukakis, the clear
favorite of their national leaders, and Jackson, who has the
endorsement of the union's top officials in Detroit and Michigan.
   Half the presidents of the 40 locals representing about 85
percent of the Communications Workers of America's 20,000 members
in the state have endorsed Dukakis. But the other 20 locals appear
equally divided between Jackson and Gephardt.
   ``I personally came out for Gephardt but I've taken a lot of
heat for it because he supported President Reagan's tax law,'' said
Robert Shukwit, president of CWA Local 4008 in Detroit.
   ``But I don't think we've seen the candidate yet,'' Shukwit
added, indicating a lingering dream among many trade unionists that
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo might emerge as an alternative.
   Meanwhile, the UAW remains the most important labor voice in
Michigan. And it has taken several steps to dissociate itself from
the endorsement its 10,000 members in Iowa gave Gephardt in
February.
   For example, the union is running TV commercials in Michigan
stressing a need for an activist government. Prior to the Iowa
caucuses, it ran ads in that state focusing on the trade issue
Gephardt has championed.
   One UAW official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
Bieber, the union's president, probably believes Dukakis is going
to be the nominee and doesn't want to stir trouble with him.
   At the same time, endorsing Dukakis would infuriate Jackson
loyalists among blacks, about 25 percent of the UAW's membership,
and Arabs, a large contingent of its Ford workers in Dearborn, the
official said.
   Nonetheless, another union official predicted that Gephardt will
fare much better in Saturday's caucuses than he has in polls over
the past two weeks in the state, which has lost 400,000 union jobs
to imports since 1982. That official mentioned an internal poll
showing Gephardt holding a narrow lead over Jackson with Dukakis a
distant third among union members.

<HEAD>Deny Israel Considering Attack on Saudi Arabia Over Missiles</HEAD>

   A high-ranking official indicated Friday that
Israel might take action if the United States fails to deal with
long-range Chinese missiles sold to Saudi Arabia.
   Other officials, however, denied that Israel was considering an
attack on the Arab kingdom.
   ``Israel has a tradition of not standing by quietly when there
is a real threat against it,'' said Yossi Ben-Aharon, a senior aide
to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. ``The question is if this is a
threat or not. There are people to deal with it, the Cabinet, the
government.''
   Saudi Arabia recently acquired the CSS-2 missiles, which have a
range of 2,200 miles, enough to strike anywhere in the Middle East.
They also are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
   Both the Chinese and the Saudis said the missiles won't be armed
with such warheads, and Saudi Arabia has said it purchased the
weapons to deter attacks on its territory during the Iran-Iraq war.
   But Israel radio reported Friday that Saudi Arabia issued a
warning through the United States that it would use any remaining
missiles to strike at the Jewish state if Israel attempted a
pre-emptive strike.
   Ben-Aharon said the issue should be left for U.S. officials,
``who told us they are going to deal with the matter the best they
can, both in China and in Saudi Arabia.''
   The Washington Post quoted U.S. intelligence sources as saying
the Israeli air force has been conducting unusually intensive
low-lewel bombing practice. It said such runs could be preparation
for a strike on Saudi Arabia, though there was no hard evidence to
support that interpretation.
   The paper also noted that such exercises could help Israel
prepare for raids on Palestinian targets in Lebanon.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, denied that Israel had made any
threats. ``We did take up our concern with the United States. But
we never made any threat against Saudi Arabia,'' he said.
   Earlier reports of a similar Ben-Aharon statement sparked strong
warnings from Egypt and Syria, and the U.S. State Department
expressed concern.
   The Syrian government said Monday that ``any agression against
the sister Saudi Arabian kingdom would obviously be an attack
against Syria.''
   Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak said he sent an urgent message
to President Reagan asking him to ``use his influence with Israel
and urge it to stop threatening Arab states in such irresponsible
way.''
   Egypt is the only Arab country to have peace treaty with Israel.
   An Israeli official who demanded anonymity said Syria and Egypt
were ``overreacting to a report that has been denied.''
   The official said Israel was going to mount a diplomatic
campaign to ``take the missiles out,'' but stressed that ``we never
made any threat to take them out militarily.''

   The United States will stage its biannual
``Ocean Venture'' exercise during April with more than 40,000
servicemen participating, the Pentagon said Friday.
   The exercise will be staged in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of
Mexico and Caribbean Sea as well as at selected bases in Florida
and Puerto Rico, the Pentagon said. It will begin on April 1 and
extend through April 22.
   ``Ocean Venture exercises are held every two years and are

said.
   ``Ocean Venture 88 will exercise command-and-control of
participating forces; their rapid deployment and employment, as
well as the integration of military reserve units into the active
force.''
   The exercise will include aircraft carrier operations; airborne,
amphibious and infantry assaults; live-fire exercises, and port
security, harbor defense and combat search and rescue drills, the
Pentagon said.
   It added that ``members of the Dutch Royal Marines from the
Netherlands Antilles will also participate in this exercise.''

   Moslem countries ended an international
conference Friday by denouncing an absent Iran for riots last year
in Mecca and for refusing to sign a cease-fire in its war with Iraq.
   Iran's delegation to the Organization of Islamic Conference in
Amman had stormed out of the five-day meeting Thursday. It
complained that the 46-member conference was only serving the
interests of Iraq, its enemy in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   The foreign ministers and other officials of Moslem nations
worldwide, in their final communique, lamented what they called
``terrorism'' by Iranian rioters in Saudi Arabia in July, according
to Jordanian Foreign Minister Taher Masri. They also praised Saudi
measures, announced Thursday, to control future disorders.
   The rioting occurred as Saudis tried to stop Iranian pilgrims at
the holy city of Mecca from marching in a political demonstration.
The violence left 402 people dead, including 275 Iranians and 80
Saudi security men.
   The Moslem nations specifically approved the Saudis' decision to
set limits on the number of pilgrims traveling to Mecca and Medina
this year.
   Masri, who chaired the final session of the gathering, said the
conference also agreed to ``make extensive efforts to force the
United Nations to take the necessary measures to force Iran to
accept'' U.N. Security Council Resolution 598. That document calls
for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and a return to international
borders.
   Iraq has agreed, but Iran says it first wants its enemy branded
as the aggressor.
   Iran, a mainly Persian nation, has often been the target of
criticisms from Arab lands.
   The conference also:
   _ Declared its support for Palestinian protests in the
Israeli-occupied territories. However, no specific action was given.
   _ Welcomed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer to pull
troops out of Afghanistan and called for it to be put into effect
immediately.
   _ Asked non-Islamic countries with Moslem populations, such as
Bulgaria, to take steps to guarantee the rights of the minorities.
   _ Withheld full recognition of Moslem rebels from the
Philippines who are fighting the Manila government.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole, saying ``I can read the numbers
and I know probably what's going to happen,'' conceded Friday that
his uphill race against Vice President George Bush for the
Republican presidential nomination appears doomed.
   In downbeat comments that departed from his prepared text, the
senator from Kansas, who has 178 delegates to Bush's 788 in the
latest Associated Press tally, told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce:
``I think it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on
the Republican side.''
   However, a Dole spokesman later said the candidate isn't ready
to abandon the race.
   Dole himself suggested he was re-evaluating his campaign.
   ``Whatever happens in the next few days or the next few weeks, I
still have some things I want to say,'' Dole told the business
group, which gave him a standing ovation.
   ``I intend to be a leader in my party. Whatever the role may be,
it will be a role of leadership, constructive leadership, keeping
the White House Republican,'' Dole added.
   Speaking with reporters afterward, Dole gave a clear indication
that, at the very least, he would scale back his campaign
appearances.
   ``I said I had a different strategy, and I think you're seeing
some of it,'' he said.
   Asked about his change in tone and comments that Bush's GOP
victory seemed a ``foregone conclusion,'' Dole told reporters:
   ``I can read the numbers and I know probably what's going to
happen.''
   After finishing first in the Iowa Republican caucuses Feb. 8,
Dole lost a series of GOP events to Bush, including a defeat in the
New Hampshire primary Feb. 16 and losses in the big round of
primaries and caucuses on Super Tuesday March 8.
   Despite his poor showings, Dole had vowed to press ahead with
his campaign.
   But on Friday he told reporters:
   ``My view is that there's some things I want to say in this
campaign and I think sometimes if you're not out there making four
or five stops a day, people are more apt to listen.''
   Asked if these were things he planned to say on his way out of
the race, Dole said, ``No. I'm not going out. I'm just going out of
here,'' meaning the building where he had been speaking.
   Walt Riker, a Dole spokesman, later said that despite Dole's
comments, ``we haven't made any official announcements'' on a Dole
withdrawal from the race.
   ``His hallmark is his candor, and today's statement reflects
that,'' Riker said. ``We're the underdog, the big underdog. We've
never said anything different about that. We know the numbers and
we know what the score is.''
   ``But that doesn't mean we have to give up. We have to
re-evaluate the campaign day by day,'' Riker said.
   When Dole was asked by reporters whether he planned to push on
at least to the Wisconsin primary on April 5, he replied: ``I may
tell you that later this week, probably next week.''
   In his remarks to the Chamber of Commerce, Dole opened on a
pessimistic note. ``I've been saying now for some time as a
candidate all the things I thought we should focus on and nobody
really seems to care,'' he said.
   ``But I still have some things to say,'' he added. ``Lo and
behold, as your candidacy weakens, you find more people willing to
listen.''
   Dole told the business audience that ``it's going to be a tough
race'' for Republicans this year and it was time for the party to
pull together.
   ``We need to keep a Republican in the White House. That's where
I'm coming from. And if it can't be me, it will be George Bush,''
he said.
   ``I'm not here in a partisan sense. I'm not going to attack any
Republican,'' he added.
   Turning to congressional races, Dole said: ``If I can count, the
next president of the United States will be dealing with a
Democratic Congress.''
   He told his audience that the federal budget deficit, $150
billion last year, was ``public enemy No. 1'' and reiterated his
proposal for a one-year across-the-board freeze on all federal
spending.

   A strong earthquake occurred in Canada's
Northwest Territories Friday and was felt over a wide area of
Canada, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
   The tremor was recorded at a preliminary magnitude of 6.2 on the
Richter scale and occurred at 12:37 p.m. MST. USGS earthquake
monitors in Golden, Colo., said seismographs placed the center of
the earthquake about 320 miles west of Yellowknife, the capital of
the Northwest Territories.
   Early reports said the tremor was felt over a wide area,
including at Yellowknife; at Whitehorse, the capital of the Yukon
Territory; and at Edmonton, the capital of Alberta Province.
   USGS scientists said two other strong earthquakes occurred in
the same general area late in 1985: a magnitude 6.6 tremor Oct. 5
and a magnitude 6.9 earthquake two days before Christmas on Dec. 23.
   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by
an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake with a magnitude of 4 can cause moderate damage in a
populated area, a quake of magnitude 5 considerable damage, a
magnitude 6 quake severe damage, one of magnitude 7 widespread,
heavy damage and a magnitude 8 quake, a ``great'' earthquake
capable of tremendous damage.
   A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans.

<HEAD>Administration Tries Again To Allow Home Apparel Making</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration launched a final
attempt Friday to overturn a 46-year-old law that prohibits
manufacturers from hiring people to produce apparel in their homes.
   The Labor Department said it will publish proposed regulations
next week that would allow employers to contract work from people
in their homes in five industries: gloves and mittens,
embroideries, buttons and buckles, hankerchiefs and some jewelry.
   However, unlike its two previous attempts to deregulate
so-called industrial homework, officials said this time they will
not try to remove the ban on women's apparel. Also, any allowed
jewelry work would be limited to stringing beads and packaging.
   Assistant Labor Secretary Fred Alvarez said excluding women's
apparel, where investigators have found about half of the
violations of the current law, was aimed at defusing opposition
from the 210,000-member International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
   However, the president of that union, Jay Mazur, said it will
vigorously oppose any relaxation of the current ban, calling the
administration's latest proposal ``a betrayal of the rights and
protections held by American workers for generations.''
   ``We will take legal action as we have in the past,'' he said,
indicating that the union will likely seek to overturn any changes
in the courts if the administration tries to implement them.
   Officials for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union
and the Service Employees International Union indicated said they
also anticipate filing court challenges to any attempt to lift the
current bans.
   Mazur said he also has asked the House and Senate labor
committees to launch investigations of what he called the
administration's ``unwillingness'' durig the past seven years to
enforce the current prohibitions on industrial homework.
   The proposed new regulations do not attempt to overturn state
bans on the same type of work at home in Hawaii, California,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island
and New Jersey.
   The ILGWU, other unions and employer associations in California
and New York led a firestorm of attacks on the administration's
last two efforts in 1981 and 1986 to repeal the industrial homework
bans.
   As a result, only the ban on knitted outerwear was lifted in
December 1984.
   Mazur said his union's review of government records show that
since then only 72 knitted outwear employers have been granted
licenses to contract out work to a total of less than 1,000 home
workers ``in a universe that is 10 to 15 times that size.''
   ``We recognize what's happening; we're not fooled,'' he said.
``If they get these bans, they'll come after us next. They've had
this licensing program in outerwear for 40 months now and they've
found violations in 80 percent of the cases they've looked at. It
hasn't worked.''
   Alvarez said the government does not know how many people in the
five industries that employers have illegally contracted to work at
home, citing estimates by others ranging from 10,000 to 100,000.
   ``What we've got is a balance of more enforcment techniques and
increased flexibility in attempting to open up new opportunities,''
he said. ``The underlying policy is that people ought to have the
freedom to work at home.''
   The latest proposal will be open for 30 days of public comment
after it is published in the Federal Register next week.
   Despite expected challenges from unions and anticipated court
appeals, Alvarez said the administration hopes to have the
prohibitions removed before Reagan leaves office next January.
   ``It seems to me we ought to be able to get a final rule
sometime this summer,'' he said.
   The current prohibitions were adopted between 1941 and 1943
under the Fair Labor Standards Act in response to what then was
preceived as rampant exploitation of mostly immigrant home workers
paid on a piecework basis.
   Removing them was a cornerstone of President Reagan's campaigns
in 1980 and 1984. And business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce have won repeated promises from adminstration officials
that it is the one thing that will be accomplished before he leaves
office.
   ``The recommendations of this administration demonstrate it has
learned nothing from history,'' the AFL-CIO said. ``The record
shows that industrial homework has brought nothing but unfair
competition, long hours and low wages for our poorest and most
disadvantaged workers.''
   Alvarez, however, said unions have not yet had a chance to study
the latest proposal, which includes what he called a new set of
``enforcement teeth'' such as requiring bonds from employers with
past records of paying less than minimum wages or other labor law
violations.

   The Socialist Labor Party sailed to a record
victory Friday in local elections, marking stiff local opposition
to Spanish claims of sovereignty over the British colony.
   In his first comments to reporters after his win, Joe Bossano,
who rejects Spanish demands for a return of sovereignty over the
enclave at its southernmost tip, restated his objection to a 1984
Brussels accord. In that document, Britain for the first time
agreed to discuss sovereignty with Spain.
   Spain ceded control over the 2-square-mile limestone rock to
Britain in 1713 following its defeat in the War of Succession.
   Bossano also said he intended to start his four-year term as new
chief minister with objections to a British-Spanish accord in
December allowing Spain access to the colony's commercial airport
and partial control of its administration.
   A conservative Spanish party leader publicly expressed worry
about the election results. Christian Democrat party leader Javier
Ruperez said Bossano's position ``makes it evident we're headed for
stormy times.''
   Final election results showed Bossano received 8,128 votes or 58
percent of votes cast Thursday to unseat incumbent Chief Minister
Adolfo Canepa of the long dominant centrist Association for the
Advancement of Civil Rights.
   Canepa, a protege of longtime party leader Sir Joshua Hassan,
received 4,442 votes or 29 percent of the total.
   Also reacting to final results Friday in Madrid, Juan Lena, a
spokesman for the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez, said the election results would have no effect on Spain's
claims on the colony and its ongoing dialogue with Britain.
   ``The elections are of great importance for the colony itself,
but they will not affect the nature of the British-Spanish
negotiating process and discussions on cooperation on Gibraltar,
including the question of sovereignty,'' he said.
   Bossano told reporters Friday he was prepared to meet with
Gonzalez in Madrid to discuss bilateral issues. But such a meeting
appeared unlikely because Spain accepts Britain as its only
legitimate negotiating partner on the matter.
   Bossano heads the 7,000-member Transport Workers General Union,
the sole industrial union in the colony. He won fame for gaining
parity in pay with Britain for workers at the colony's shipyard.
   His party won eight votes in the 15-seat House of Assembly, and
Canepa's party gained the other seven.

   Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis, a longtime opponent of U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras, said Friday he would support aid to the rebels to support
the new ceasefire and the regional peace plan of Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias.
   In a final day of campaigning for Saturday's Michigan caucuses,
Dukakis praised the ceasefire agreement reached this week in
Nicaragua and called on the Reagan administration to support it.
   ``After seven years of a failed and illegal policy, it is time
for the administration to ... get behind the peace plan _ not next
week, not next month, but now,'' he told reporters at a United Auto
Workers union hall in this Grand Rapids, Mich., suburb.
   The Massachusetts governor is leading in opinion polls in
Michigan, but he warned his supporters not to take anything for
granted.
   ``Friends, you're looking at a guy who was 50 points ahead in
the polls in 1978 when I first ran for re-election ... and I
lost,'' he said. ``I don't pay any attention to the polls and I
hope you don't.''
   ``It's a very important state. If we can do well here, it will
be a giant step on the road to the nomination and the presidency,''
Dukakis said.
   He had planned a full day of campaigning in Michigan, but
logistical problems snarled those plans. Bad weather kept Dukakis
from returning to the state early Friday morning, causing
cancelation of events in Detroit and Saginaw.
   He held a town meeting with UAW workers and retirees in Comstock
Park and then held a final rally in Hamtramck.
   Dukakis had emphasized repeatedly his opposition to all aid to
the Contras. Asked Friday if he supported any aid to the Contras
now _ as laid out in the ceasefire agreement _ Dukakis told
reporters:
   ``Only if it is for the very limited purpose of carrying out the
provisions of the Arias plan ... providing it is channeled through
international relief agencies, neutral agencies and not the CIA and
the agencies of the federal government.''
   Dukakis said he doesn't want the Reagan administration to handle
the money because ``I don't trust this administration to provide
that aid directly.''
   Asked if his position is consistent with his earlier stance that
``not one dollar'' of aid go to the Contras, he replied: ``Yes,
because this is for the purpose of implementing the peace plan.''
   He said the ``non-lethal'' or ``humanitarian'' aid proposed in
the past for the Contras was for the purpose of pursuing the war
against the government of Nicaragua.
   ```Non-lethal' or `humanitarian' or `the resistance' _ all of
this stuff is PR stuff coming out of the administration. I don't
buy it. We ought to decide what we are talking about here. A great
deal of the aid that was called non-lethal was direct aid for the
Contras. And I think we know that.
   ``If what we are about here is genuinely implementing the Arias
plan or the ceasefire or both, then it may make sense to provide
some assistance through international relief agencies,'' Dukakis
said.

   President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican
Republic said Friday he would grant asylum to Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega if asked, but President Reagan said the
Dominican Republic isn't far enough away.
   Balaguer, in an interview with the Voice of America, said: ``We
are willing to receive anyone who has political problems. If Mr.
Noriega or anybody else requests our hospitality, we would give it
to them, not because we agree with his regime, but rather that the
traditional policy of our country has been one of open doors to all
political refugees.''
   Reagan, asked whether he expected Noriega to go to the Dominican
Republic, replied, ``No, that's not far enough.''
   A senior administration official said Reagan referred to this
remark during his private 50-minute meeting with Balaguer, but the
veteran Dominican leader did not respond.
   The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said,
``We do not believe that having him (Noriega) that close to Panama
is a sensible move.''
   Noriega has been indicted on drug-trafficking charges by two
federal grand juries in Florida. The Justice Department has said it
would not seek his extradition if he would agree to leave Panama
and take asylum in an agreed-upon country elsewhere. Spain has
offered him exile.
   The apparent disagreement over Noriega came during a Washington
visit in which Balaguer met with Reagan, other administration
officials and senators and expressed hope that his pleas for higher
U.S. sugar quotas would be heeded.
   ``There are problems which subsist in our relations, especially
in connection with the lowering of our sugar quota, but this we
have discussed with president Reagan and with his senior advisors
in this area of expertise,'' Balaguer said in a departure statement.
   ``We also discussed the subject this morning on Capitol Hill
with a number of senators who are friends of the Dominican
Republic,'' he said. ``We found there a very receptive climate and
feel confident that the problem will be solved, taking into account
the interests of both our countries.''
   Reagan, in his remarks at the departure ceremony on a porch
facing the White House Rose Garden, did not refer to the issue of
sugar quotas, a touchy issue with the Dominicans since sugar is
their major crop.
   The annual quota for sugar imports from the Dominican Republic
to the United States has been reduced from about 750,000 tons in
the early 1980s to 123,000 tons this year.
   The senior official said the administration will continue to
press Congress for changes in U.S. sugar policy. He said Balaguer
``asked for help,'' both with the sugar quotas and with the
declining levels of U.S. aid.
   Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz told Balaguer the
United States would make available $10 million worth of surplus
U.S. corn, providing the Dominicans with food as well as $10
million in foreign exchange, the official said.
   Reagan, in his departure remarks, said, ``Within our budget
limitations, we will continue to support development and growth in
the Dominican Republic.''

with others if it would help country music.
   ``We'll do just about anything as long as it's legal to promote
the goodness of country music,'' said daughter Wynonna Judd.
   ``We're pretty joined at the lips, you know,'' added her mother,
Naomi.
   After collecting another vocal duo of the year award from the
Academy of Country Music here Monday night, the women talked about
the responsibility each new award means.
   ``You have people who support you. You read your mail,'' Wynonna
said. ``We get lots of letters from people saying, `You helped me
through such a hard time in my life.'
   ``You get so much support from people that you really feel you
want to do your best. You want to be the best you can be.''

   Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Ellen
Goodman says women have been successful in getting into the male
world, but have not been able to get that world to adapt to their
needs.
   The workplace, though welcoming more women than ever, still is a
man's world and that perpetuates a conflict between work and
family, she said.
   In addition, women in the work place are seen as isolated
individuals with no families, she said Thursday.
   Speaking at the 25th anniversary celebration of the University
of Missouri-Kansas City Family Study Center, Goodman said
individual rather than community goals are being emphasized in this
decade.

   Eleven-year-old Nikki Edwards says
she'll never wash her face again, at least not the cheek that
singer Michael Jackson kissed.
   ``So every time I take a shower, I put a wash cloth over my face
so it doesn't get wet,'' she said Friday, a week after the kiss.
   Nikki and her sister, Mari Anna Miller, 24, were in the front
row at Jackson's concert March 18 in Indianapolis when the
fifth-grader was selected to come on stage.
   A burly man grabbed Nikki's arm and Ms. Miller, thinking the
fellow was trying to hurt her sister, belted him.
   ``He flashed his light on Mari Anna's face and then on his
security badges,'' Nikki said. ``The security man said, `Mr.
Jackson was wondering if you would appear on stage with him.'''
   When Jackson led Nikki on stage, ``I thought to myself here he
comes and I'm going to die,'' she said. ``Then I thought what a way
to go.''
   Jackson, a Gary native, hugged her while he sang ``She's Out of
My Life.''

   Dennis Hopper says he was shocked by the
police reaction to the new movie he directed, ``Colors,'' which
features police battling drug dealing and street crime by violent
southern California gangs.
   Real law enforcement officers were given a preview and several
detectives said the film glamorizes the gang lifestyle and could
trigger violence among gang audiences. Assistant Police Chief
Robert Vernon suggested it be banned.
   Hopper says that reaction shows how much the gang problem is out
of control.
   ``At the beginning we point out that there are 250 men and women
in law enforcement working against 600 gangs with over 70,000
members,'' he said. ``How can they possibly handle it?''
   The film, scheduled for release in mid-April, stars Robert
Duvall and Sean Penn as policemen.

   Washington state lawmakers called Friday for a
Senate hearing on the Navy's decision to bar civilian employees of
the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard from participating in the state's
March 8 presidential caucuses.
   While the employees were allowed to attend the caucuses, the
Navy said that a provision of the Hatch Act forbade them from
speaking. Some of the employees reportedly wore gags when they
attended the caucuses.
   ``We are concerned that this implementation of the Hatch Act may
have seriously affected the outcome of the caucuses in the
Bremerton area,'' all 10 members of the Washington state delegation
said in a letter to Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.
   The committee is currently considering changes in the Hatch Act.

<TEXT>
   Gary Hart's financial adviser is hoping $110,000
from Hart's aborted 1988 presidential campaign can eventually be
applied to the former candidate's 1984 debts.
   Bernard Schneider, who serves as Hart's financial adviser, says
he is happy with Thursday's FEC ruling that allows Hart to pay off
debts left from his 1984 campaign with excess funds from his most
recent 1988 camaign.
   Schaefer expects $110,000 to remain after the 1988 campaign
clears its debts and returns a share of matching funds to the FEC.
   Since his 1984 campaign, Hart has reduced his $4.75 million debt
to $1.1 million through fundraisers and debt settlements.
   ``It's a very good record for a losing presidential campaign,''
Schneider said. ``People lose sight of that in this whole feeding
frenzy around Gary.''

   A vote of confidence can sometimes be as
good as a vote itself for Vice President George Bush _ just ask
101-year-old Mary Fishbyrne.
   Bush sent her an autographed color portrait of himself after
learning that Fishbyrne, who prefers to be called Miss Mary, had
been frustrated when she tried to vote for him in Louisiana's Super
Tuesday primary.
   Miss Mary, a registered Democrat who has voted in every
presidential election since women were granted suffrage in 1920,
thought Bush was a smart man and ``would make a good president.''
But she could not cast her ballot for him because voters in the
state's presidential primary aren't permitted to cross party lines.
   A Bush campaign spokesman said a campaign worker heard of Miss
Mary's frustrations on Super Tuesday and decided to send her the
picture in appreciation for her would-have-been vote.
   She said Bush has her support in November. ``If I can make it
there, I'll vote for him.''

<TEXT>
   The United States will begin a series of mock
inspections next month to prepare its new force of arms control
inspectors and escorts to deal with Soviet facilities and
personnel, a ranking Pentagon official said Friday.
   The exercises will be staged at the 21 sites in Europe and the
United States where Soviet inspectors will be allowed to visit to
ensure compliance with a treaty banning intermediate and
shorter-range nuclear missiles, the official added.
   The mock inspections will begin April 6 and should be completed
by May 10, hopefully in plenty of time to allow final preparations
for the real inspections that will begin 30 days after the U.S.
Senate ratifies the pact, the source said.
   The official agreed to meet with a group of reporters Friday to
discuss the Defense Department's formation of the On-Site
Inspection Agency, or OSIA, only on condition he not be identified
publicly.
   The agency is to be the arm of the federal government
responsible for verifying Russian compliance with the new treaty.
Signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on
Dec. 8, the treaty specifies that all nuclear missiles in the two
superpower arsenals with a range of roughly 300 miles to 3,500
miles be destroyed within three years.
   The OSIA will be responsible for escorting Soviet inspectors who
travel to the United States and sites in Western Europe to monitor
the removal and destruction of American nuclear weapons, as well as
performing the same role inside the Soviet Union by visiting
Russian facilities and deployment sites.
   The official said next month's practice sessions would involve
both inspectors and escorts, with the inspectors pretending to be
Soviet officials who are met by the American escorts.
   Under the treaty, there are 10 sites open to Soviet inspection
inside the United States and another 11 in Western Europe. All 21
sites will be tested to ensure they're ready for hosting Russian
inspectors, the official said.
   ``And we will challenge them (the escorts) with all kinds of
possible variances in the (inspection) routine,'' said the source.
   According to the official, the task of staffing the OSIA has now
been completed. The agency will keep in place 20 teams of 10
members each for the inspections, plus a headquarters' staff of 50
in Washington. Perhaps a third of the inspectors are women, the
official said, and a sufficient number of Russian linguists have
been located, although with some difficulty.
   The U.S. Military Airlift Command will be responsible for
providing the aircraft and crews needed to ferry American
inspectors to two ``entry points'' into the Soviet Union and to
move Russian inspectors around inside the United States, the
official continued.
   The two entry points for the Russians will be Washington, D.C.,
and San Francisco, Calif., and the Pentagon intends to inform the
news media when the Soviets arrive for spot inspections, the source
said.
   The head of the OSIA, Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, and his Soviet
counterpart have already met once _ during a technical meeting in
Moscow earlier this month _ and will meet again in Washington
starting April 12, the official continued.
   The technical meetings are being held to sort out questions
about the type of monitoring and survey equipment that will be used
by the inspectors, the source said.

   Conan Owen knew it was Thursday once
again when officials served up beef stew in Gallery One of the
Model Prison.
   Owen, a 23-year-old free-lance photographer from Annandale, Va.,
has been marking off the days in his stark white cell for more than
a year, ever since a Spanish Civil Guard found more than four
pounds of cocaine in a suitcase registered in his name.
   ``I don't belong in here because I'm innocent, and if this were
the United States, I would have been out a long time ago,'' Owen
said in an interview in this 85-year-old prison in the heart of
downtown Barcelona.
   Owen, whose case has drawn the attention of Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, is to stand trial Saturday before a three-judge
panel. The prosecution is asking for a 10-year sentence.
   He arrived at Barcelona's El Prat airport on March 13, 1987 _
Friday the 13th _ on a flight from Santiago, Chile, via Amsterdam.
He said he was on his way to Spain for the first time to shoot
pictures for tourist agency travel brochures.
   ``I was working as a free-lance, and the guy offered me $1,000
for four days' work. I like to travel, so I accepted and thought I
was taking a suitcase full of travel brochures and film to someone
in Spain,'' he said.
   Owen was booked on charges of cocaine smuggling, denied bail and
taken to the Modelo, as the jail is known here.
   ``This is the worst jail in Spain, the oldest and the
most-crowded,'' said guard Manuel Escobedo. ``It was meant to hold
600 people, but there are about 2,400 in here now.''
   According to the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, as of last month there
were 25 U.S. citizens in jail in Spain. Six are serving prison
terms following conviction on drug-related charges, and another
nine, including Owen, are awaiting trial.
   Owen's attorney, Ana Campa, plans to enter as evidence results
of a polygraph test administered to Owen by an agent of the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency, which she says indicates Owen is telling
the truth about his photo job and the suitcase.
   On Feb. 5, George Barahona, the man who offered Owen the job,
pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to a drug conspiracy count.
He told the court he had shared a hotel room with Owen in Santiago
and planted the cocaine-lined suitcase on the unsuspecting
photographer.
   Barahona received a two-year suspended sentence and a promise he
would not be extradited to Spain in return for his cooperation.
   Following his testimony, three Spaniards and three Bolivians,
all fugitives, were indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on
cocaine conspiracy charges in connection with the case.
   ``It was my parents who first confronted Barahona, because my
cousin Maria Teresa Corrales knew him and he lived in the area,''
Owen said. ``At first he denied everything, but then he told the
truth.''
   When Meese came to Spain to sign an annex to a 1970 extradition
treaty Feb. 9, he also handed over copies of Barahona's statement
to Spanish judicial authorities.
   Owen is a 1986 graduate of Syracuse University and in 1984 was a
summer intern in Vice President George Bush's office.
   The walls of the halls leading to the five sections of the
prison are decorated with travel posters for Catalonia, the region
in which Barcelona is located, and neighboring France.
   Owen said what he has seen of Spain consists of the Barcelona
airport, the court where he was arraigned and the Modelo.
   During his year in jail Owen has read 150 books, written letters
and walked miles around the patio during the daily morning and
afternoon recreation periods.
   Guards in Spanish jails are unarmed, and inmates wear street
clothes. Prisoners in the Modelo are allowed one, one-hour conjugal
visit every month with a woman of their choice.
   ``It's the boredom that gets you more than anything, the lack of
stimulating conversation, someone to talk about serious things
with,'' said Owen.

<HEAD>U.S. Shouldn't Make Quick Move To Give Submarine Secrets to Canada</HEAD>

   The United States should think very carefully
before permitting highly secret U.S. submarine technology to be
sold to Canada, two senators said Friday.
   ``This is a decision that should be very carefully scrutinized
before we decide to go ahead,'' said Sen. James J. Exon, D-Neb.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services strategic weapons
subcommittee, in a speech on the Senate floor.
   ``We have a number of questions which need to be answered before
this decision is made,'' agreed Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking
Republican on the Armed Services Committee and a former secretary
of the Navy.
   Canada last year proposed to construct a fleet of 10 to 12
nuclear-powered submarines and is considering building boats which
are updated versions of the British Trafalgar-class subs or the
French Rubis-class subs.
   The Trafalgars use U.S. technology, which means the information
could not be supplied to Canada by the British unless the United
States approves, both Exon and Warner said.
   If the Pentagon decides to permit Canada to use the American
technology, Congress could block the plan within 90 days if both
the House and Senate pass resolutions of disapproval, Exon added.
   The Pentagon has not yet decided to grant a waiver to Britain,
Navy Secretary William Ball III told the Armed Services Committee
earlier this week.
   Exon noted that U.S. nuclear-powered sub technology had only
been transferred once in the past, to Britain, and he questioned
whether Canada has ``the money and the enormous infrastructure''
needed to safely operate the subs.
   ``In this era of nuclear phobia, we must maintain and enhance
our shipboard standards of nuclear propulsion,'' Exon said. Any
accidents aboard Canadian subs which involve U.S. technology would
raise fears about U.S. subs and could hamper the American Navy's
operation, he told his colleagues.
   Warner said, ``before we approve this decision, we need to know
how Canada proposes to fund this program, how Canada proposes to
insure that the standard of nuclear safety will be at least as high
as the United States and the British.''
   Exon said the technology involved may be outdated and he noted
that the Soviets are building a bigger, faster class of attack
boats.

   A 3-year-old boy scalded to death in a welfare
hotel reportedly was removed from foster care and returned to his
mother and father last summer despite a judge's reservations.
   Police have charged that the mother, Marian McKenzie, 21,
murdered Quintin by holding him in 136-degree water because he had
soiled his diaper. The boy's father, Calvin, 23, has been charged
with beating him earlier that day.
   The McKenzies received custody of Quintin and his older sister,
Tanisha, after Judge Joseph Esquirol of Family Court in Brooklyn
dismissed a case brought in December 1986 by city child welfare
authorities.
   The city sought to remove the children from the McKenzies on
grounds that the father had beaten Quintin at a shelter in New
Jersey where the family then was living.
   New York Newsday and the Daily News reported that after numerous
delays during which the city produced no evidence of a beating,
Esquirol dismissed the case May 26.
   The judge stayed return of the children to June 3 and urged that
city or New Jersey officials refile the case.
   ``I know I certainly didn't want to return the children. The
mother had admitted to New Jersey authorities that the father beat
her and the children,'' the judge told Newsday. ``It was very, very
frustrating.''
   William Grinker, head of the city's Human Resources
Administration, has declined to comment before completion of an
investigation of his agency's handling of the case.
   Quintin had spent more than half his 41-month life in foster
care or hospitals, including the first six months of his life. He
weighed only 1.8 pounds when he was born prematurely.

<TEXT>
   Sworn statements that led authorities to dig
up a body in a police chief's yard tell of a friendship that
allegedly developed into wife-swapping but ended in homicide.
   A District Court judge allowed the affidavits to be released
Friday, a week after he rejected arguments by the state attorney
general that they should be sealed to protect a continuing homicide
investigation.
   Robert Chambers, who resigned as part-time chief after the body
was found, has said through his lawyer that he is innocent of any
wrongdoing. No charges have been filed.
   Mark Sisti, a public defender representing Chambers, called the
affidavits ``low-quality, unsubstantiated blatant hearsay.''
   The attorney general's office said Friday it was satisfied with
the progress of the investigation and expected an arrest, though it
did not say when.
   According to sworn statements given by Chambers' sister, his
niece and a brother-in-law, the following story emerges:
   Chambers, 36, and good friend Russell Bean, then 25, worked
together at a factory in Keene, and ``were having a wife swap.''
Sometime in September 1978 the two were drinking at an abandoned
quarry when they got into a fight and Bean died. Robert, with the
help of his father, Clifton Chambers, buried Bean's body.
   After Bean disappeared, Chambers divorced his wife, Deborah, and
married Bean's wife, Sylvia.
   Robert and Sylvia Chambers settled in his five-room cabin on a
dirt road three miles outside of Marlow and he became the part-time
police chief for the town of 600 three years ago. He also became
the part-time chief of nearby Gilsum and a police trainee in
Winchester. He has a leave of absence from Gilsum and is suspended
with pay from Winchester.
   On March 11, police began digging in Chambers' front yard with a
backhoe. Three days later, Bean's skeleton was found 20 feet deep.
   Pathologists determined Bean had been beaten on the head and
chest.
   On March 2, Clifton Chambers told his daughter, Melissa, and
granddaughter, Lorrie Wheeler, that Robert came to him in the
middle of the night 10 years ago and said ``he had just killed
Russell and wanted to know what to do.'' Robert said the two were
drinking, got into a fight and Robert hit Bean, who fell back, hit
his head and died instantly.
   The father, in ill health, made Melissa and Lorrie promise not
to say anything until after his death.
   One week later, Clifton Chambers, 61, suffered a cerebral
hemorrhage and died. That same day, Melissa and Lorrie told the
story to the Keene police, who relayed the information to state
police.
   Sgt. Clayton Young of the state police major crimes unit
interviewed the women and Louis LaCourse, the husband of Melissa's
sister, Susan. Authorities then sought a warrant to excavate the
chief's yard.
   ``The relationship between Robert, Russ, Sylvia and Debbie was
weird,'' Melissa said in her statement. ``It's called
wife-swapping, that was going on before Debbie ran off and Russ
disappeared. I know Robert always beat Debbie, that was why she ran
off. (She) couldn't take it any longer.''
   Deborah, who was admitted to a Keene hospital with an
undisclosed illness after the digging began, left Chambers in July
1978.
   Bean was last seen in September 1978, and his wife moved in with
Chambers that October. In January 1979, she divorced the missing
Bean. Chambers divorced Deborah in March and Chambers and Sylvia
married in September 1979.
   Young's affidavit said Sylvia wrote Bean's mother two letters
about his disappearance. The first said Bean had borrowed money
from Chambers, who then gave Bean a ride to the Vermont state line
and let him out.
   Later, she wrote that she feared Chambers, and that she was
afraid Chambers had harmed Bean.
   LaCourse told police that after Bean disappeared, Chambers told
him he ``would not have to worry about seeing him (Bean) again. He
(Chambers) hit him so hard no one would ever seen him again.''
   Melissa, who lived with her father and Lorrie in a trailer
behind Robert Chambers' home, said her mother, now deceased, warned
her to ``look out for Robert.'' Last year, her father ``warned (me)
about my brother being dangerous,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Mickey and Minnie Mouse led baby boomers
and their swivel-hipped soul mates of all ages back to the 1950s
Friday as 1,527 people simultaneously spun Hula Hoops at Disneyland
to claim a world record.
   The crowd _ certified by a turnstile count _ gyrated to the
strains of ``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' until a representative
of the Guinness Book of World Records was satisfied he had
witnessed history's biggest crowd of Hula Hoopers.
   But for most of the swirlers, making Hula Hoop history took a
back seat to having fun.
   ``I'm reliving my childhood,'' said Frank Samagaio, 36, an
investigator with the San Diego district attorney's office.
   ``I was 7 years old when these came out,'' Samagaio said,
demonstrating that Hula Hooping, like riding a bike, is a skill one
never loses entirely.
   Some hoopers woke up as early as 4 a.m. to reach the park from
distant points of Southern California. They were all given
T-shirts, free park admission and Hula Hoops.
   The record try was a promotion by Disneyland and Hula Hoop maker
Wham-O, which is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the toy this
week.
   Some inept hoopers twirled the hoops on their wrists while
others madly twisted while the hoops inexorably spun farther and
farther down their legs.
   ``It's in the hips,'' confided Jackie Eastman, 11, of
Penasquitos, who got a hoop for her birthday March 9 and already
can twirl it for 10 minutes at a stretch.
   After three false starts, Dan Roddick, a Wham-O employee who
also serves as a Guinness field representative, proclaimed success,
which he had earlier defined as everyone putting his or her hoop
through three revolutions at once.
   While Guinness doesn't actually recognize a mass Hula Hoop
record at present, Roddick said the largest known mass swivel
appears to have been performed by about 350 people some 25 years
ago in the Northwest. That event is recorded only by a photograph,
he said.
   For some of the teens and young adults in Friday's crowd, the
event was sort of a ticket to more innocent times, symbolized for
them by pompadour hair-dos and the do-wop music of the 1950s and
early '60.
   ``It was happier,'' said Sarah Culver, 20, a college student
from Tustin who favors 1950s music, dance and clothes.
   ``The styles, they fit better, they're more feminine,'' Miss
Culver said. ``You can dance with the guys _ closer _ you don't
have to dance by yourself.''

   Gov. Bob Martinez said Friday that

   ``I probably won't make any more announcements now until the
report comes in. It wouldn't be appropriate,'' he said.
   Martinez also established an independent seven-member commission
to review the investigation's findings to avoid any appearance that
he was mounting a political attack against the Office of Capital
Collateral Representative, a 3-year-old agency that has won stays
of executions for dozens of inmates.
   The St. Petersburg Times reported Friday that allegedly false
affidavits were given to Martinez and Attorney General Bob
Butterworth after witnesses _ two prison inmates, a Miami
prosecutor and a Miami lawyer _ complained about the conduct of
several employees of the collateral appeals office.
   In each case, inmates who testified against men on death row say
they were asked to sign false affidavits that would be used to gain
a stay of execution.
   Ronald Guralnick, the Miami lawyer who represented one of the
inmates, said attorneys from the Office of Capital Collateral
Representative in Tallahassee told him they had filed a motion
alleging ``everything possible'' and would ``try to prove it
later,'' the newspaper said.
   In both cases the affidavits, allegedly prepared by the death
row lawyers, accused police who handled the murder investigations
of inventing testimony that witnesses later repeated in court.
   Larry Spalding, the lawyer who supervises the collateral appeals
office, said he has questioned the lawyers involved in one instance
and will support them until he sees evidence to change his mind.
   ``The other one I know nothing about, but I will immediately
talk to those involved,'' Spalding said Thursday.
   Spalding blamed the investigation on the continuing controversy
between his office and a governor who, he said, wants to speed up
executions.
   Spalding's office was established in 1985 to handle appeals
filed by death row inmates. Those appeals traditionally involve
issues not concerning guilt of innocence, but legal procedures.
   The stae set up the appeals agency to provide lawyers for
indigent inmates making their final appeal and do away with claims
that inmates were not properly represented.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. portrayed his Democratic
presidential opponents as too liberal on Friday, saying ``you don't
have to be very far to the right to be to the right of this crowd.''
   Gore also said he was optimistic about his chances in Saturday's
Michigan caucuses.
   ``Wherever we have had a level playing field and enough time to
get the message out and become known by the voters, we have won,''
he told a radio audience in Detroit. ``The time in Michigan has
been short ... but we've got a lot of good friends working for us
and I hope that we'll do significantly better than people expect.''
   Gore has steadfastly tried to depict himself as the moderate
candidate in the presidential field.
   The Tennessee senator addressed the subject anew on Friday after
being asked a question on his defense posture.
   ``It's not conservative. I've never used that word. Let me
hasten to add, you don't have to be very far to the right to be to
the right of this crowd,'' he said.
   Earlier, in Racine, Wis., Gore rolled up his sleeves and joined
foundry workers at their jobs. Wearing a shiny white hardhat, blue
jeans and a leisure shirt, Gore took a 1{-hour tour of the Racine
Steel Casting plant.
   The campaign stop gave Gore a chance to shovel chunks of metal
into a furnace, to help a worker form a casting mold and to drive a
forklift and unload large metal sprockets.
   ``I think getting some hands-on experience is a way to
communicate symbolically with the workers,'' he said.
   Gore told reporters he will continue to campaign heavily in
Wisconsin, which will hold its primary April 5.
   ``I predict we're really going to surprise people in
Wisconsin,'' he said. ``Wisconsin has a chance to play a unique
role.''
   Gore also picked up the endorsement Friday of one-time
presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy.
   McCarthy, who was a senator from Minnesota when he sought the
Democratic nomination in 1968, said he endorses Gore because of his
experience and voting record on foreign affairs and economic and
environmental issues.
   ``There is no better preparation for the presidency than being
in Congress, especially the Senate,'' McCarthy said.
   ``I've felt for some time that the governorship is the worst
preparation for the presidency,'' McCarthy said. ``It provides a
great oversimplification of how the federal government operates.''

   Allowing surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould to continue visiting Baby M will hurt the child
psychologically, the toddler's father argued in court papers
released Friday.
   William Stern, who won custody of the baby in a landmark state
Supreme Court ruling Feb. 3, asked a Superior Court judge to
discontinue visitation. Stern's attorney said he will call expert
witnesses to show that halting visitation would be in the best
interest of the child, now legally known as Melissa Stern.
   ``Testimony will again reconfirm ... that visitation at this
particular point could only have a destabilizing influence on the
child and result in very grave consequences on her future mental
health,'' attorney Gary Skoloff said in court papers.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has asked that she be allowed to spend more
time with the baby, with the meetings expanded eventually to half
the summer and some holidays.
   She has been allowed to see Melissa once a week, for two hours,
under supervision. Court papers released Thursday by Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's attorneys call that schedule ``insufficient.''
   She contends that the child would be harmed if those visitations
were discontinued.
   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationship
with Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing
and productive relationship,'' said court papers filed by Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Harold Cassidy.
   The documents, filed earlier this week, give an indication what
both sides will argue when Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween on
Monday convenes a visitation hearing that may be the final legal
skirmish in the fierce battle over the child, who turns 2 Sunday.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's $10,000 contract with Stern became a
highly publicized court case after she refused to turn over the
child she agreed to bear. Since the case began, Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould divorced her first husband, Richard Whitehead, and
married a Wall Street broker, Dean Gould.

<HEAD>Reagan Says US `Totally Opposed' To Any Israeli Attack On Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan warned Israel on Friday that
the United States would be ``totally opposed'' to any Israeli
attack on Saudi Arabia's new intermediate-range missile launchers.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, meanwhile,
confirmed that the administration has cautioned Israel not take
action against the newly delivered Chinese missiles.
   Mrs. Oakley refused to comment on reports that the Israeli air
force has been conducting low-level practice bombing runs.
   Reagan, asked how the United States would feel about Israeli
attacks on the Saudi sites, said, ``Naturally, we would be totally
opposed to any such thing and hope that they are not considering
any such act.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in Cairo Thursday that he
had sent an urgent message to Reagan urging him to ``use his
influence with Israel and urge it to stop threatening Arab states
in this irresponsible way.'' Mubarak said such an attack would
``blow up the entire peace process'' in the Middle East.
   Reagan was asked about the situation as he prepared to meet with
visiting President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic.
   On Wednesday, an unidentified Egyptian official said Cairo would
consider any Israeli attack on the installations an attack on Egypt
itself.
   Saudi Arabia recently acquired the missiles, which have a range
of 2,200 miles, enough to reach Iran and Israel. The missiles are
capable of carrying nuclear warheads, but both China and Saudi
Arabia have given assurances they will be fitted only with
conventional warheads.
   In Jerusalem, Yossi Ben-Aharon, a senior aide to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said, ``Israel has a tradition of not standing by
quietly when there is a real threat against it. The question is if
this is a threat or not. There are people to deal with it, the
Cabinet, the government.''
   Israel radio reported that Saudi Arabia issued a warning through
the United States that it would use any remaining missiles to
strike at the Jewish state if Israel attempted a pre-emptive strike.
   Ben-Aharon said U.S. officials had ``told us they are going to
deal with the matter the best they can, both in China and in Saudi
Arabia.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan
administration was ``concerned about any instability that is
introduced by weapons changes in the area'' and had made its views
known to both the Israelis and the Saudis. He added that ``our
protests have gone to the nuclear capability as opposed to the
site.''

   Sen. Bob Dole conceded Friday it was a ``foregone conclusion''
that George Bush would win the Republican presidential nomination,
while long-shots Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon looked to Michigan
Democrats to resuscitate their fading campaigns.
   ``I can read the numbers and I probably know what's happening,''
Dole told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce audience in Washington. Dole
indicated he was re-evaluating his campaign and would likely ``have
something to say'' before the April 5 Wisconsin primary.
   The campaigns of Gephardt and Dole, winners of the lead-off Iowa
caucuses in their respective parties, stood at turning points on
Friday.
   Gephardt stayed in Michigan, insisting that ``we're going to
turn this race around'' _ although his aides were saying privately
that the Missouri congressman would call it quits if he lost
Michigan's Saturday caucuses.
   An aura of political fatalism hovered over Dole's hard-luck
drive for the White House, as he said of the successor to President
Reagan, ``If it can't be me, it will be George Bush.''
   Bush has garnered 788 delegates to the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans next August, more than two-thirds the
number necessary to win the nomination. Propelled by his sweep in
the Super Tuesday competition of March 8, the vice president has
amassed 727 of those delegates in the last 30 days, while Dole has
won none. The Kansas senator has 178 delegates, and Robertson, 17.
   The vice president, who learned about Dole's comments shortly
after giving a speech at the University of Denver, said, ``This
doesn't say it's over. So I'm going to just keep going right down
to the wire and not speculate on somebody else's campaign or on the
Democratic side.''
   Asked whether he would consider Dole as a running mate, Bush
said, ``It's too early for me to start thinking about any running
mates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that I
don't want to do.''
   Dole, in his speech to the Chamber of Commerce, said, ``I've
been saying now for some time as a candidate all the things I
thought we should focus on, and nobody really seems to care.''
   ``I think it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening
on the Republican side,'' he said. ``But I still have some things
to say. Lo and behold, as your candidacy weakens, you find more
people willing to listen.''
   Bush, campaigning in Colorado, shrugged off questions about his
role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``The Democrats are short of real issues,'' he said, ``bringing
it up over and over again. No one is even suggesting I have done
anything wrong.''
   Most of the Democrats were in Michigan, scouring the heavily
industrialized state for votes in Saturday's caucuses, with 138
delegates at stake.
   Michigan had been described by Gephardt's aides earlier as a
do-or-die campaign battlefield. On Friday, Gephardt mimicked rival
Michael Dukakis' claim of an economic miracle in Massachusetts,
saying he looked forward to a ``Michigan miracle'' to revive his
candidacy.
   ``We're going to get back in the middle of this thing,''
Gephardt said in an interview on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program.
   Dukakis was leading in opinion polls in Michigan, but he warned
his supporters not to take anything for granted. ``Friends, you're
looking at a guy who was 50 points ahead in the polls in 1978 when
I first ran for re-election ... and I lost,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor, a longtime opponent of U.S. aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras, said he would support aid to the rebels to
support the new ceasefire and the regional peace plan of Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias _ ``providing it is channeled through
international relief agencies, neutral agencies and not the CIA and
the agencies of the federal government.''
   During an airport news conference, Simon was asked about the
possibility that he would win no delegates in Michigan.
   ``I recognize that's a possibility but it's not fatal to my
campaign,'' he said.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. sought to set himself apart from the rest
of the Democratic field, saying his more moderate stands are ``not
conservative. I've never used that word. Let me hasten to add, you
don't have to be very far to the right to be to the right of this
crowd.''
   Jesse Jackson criticized Reagan for vetoing legislation
extending a civil rights law _ a veto supported by Bush but
overridden by Congress _ and called it ``an attempt to turn back
the clock.''
   ``Any man who stands ... against civil rights restoration in
this country is not fit to lead our nation,'' Jackson said in
Detroit.
   Dukakis and Jackson are running one-two in the Democratic
delegate race, according to The Associated Press tabulation.
   Dukakis has 548 of the 2,082 delegates needed for nomination,
while Jackson has 520. Gore has 362 delegates, Simon 171 and
Gephardt 154.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will meet
Saturday with two members of the legislative arm of the Palestine
Liberation Organization as Americans are being warned to keep away
from the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza.
   Professor Edward Said of Columbia University, one of the two
Palestine National Council members invited by Shultz, said they
notified PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and he approved of the session.
   As U.S. citizens, Said said he and Professor Ibrahim Abu-Lughud
of Northwestern University did not need a `'green light'' from
Arafat to see Shultz. ``We did notify Chairman Arafat, and that was
fine with him _ absolutely,'' Said said in a telephone interview.
   The State Department said the meeting did not represent a change
in the 13-year-old U.S. policy of not dealing with the PLO. Both
the United States and Israel have condemned it as a terrorist
organization.
   In another action Friday, the State Department issued a travel
advisory against the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza. Americans
were cautioned not to travel to the areas.
   The announcement coincided with the approach of Easter and
Passover, Christian and Jewish holidays that usually attract
tourists to the Holy Land.
   Said said he and Abu-Lughud were interested in ``an exchange of
views'' with Shultz. He said they wanted to know more about the
U.S. proposal for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   ``I am not a diplomat,'' Said said. ``We're going to tell him
about the Palestinians' view of the whole matter.''
   Asked if the PLO should participate in the negotiations, the
Columbia professor replied without hesitation: ``Absolutely.''
   He said he did not know if the meeting changed U.S. policy
toward the PLO. ``I have no idea. I`m not too concerned about
this,'' he said.
   A State Department announcement Friday described Said and
Abu-Lughud as ``prominent Americans with an intimate knowledge of
contemporary Middle Eastern politics.''
   Their membership on the Palestine National Council was not
mentioned in the announcement but was confirmed later by State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad protested Shultz's invitation to
the two as in conflict with the U.S. policy against dealing with
the PLO, which is pledged to dismantling Israel as a Jewish state.
   The State Department, meantime, cited ``continuing
disturbances'' in urging Americans to stay away from the West Bank
and Gaza. A total of 111 Palestinian Arabs and an Israel soldier
have died in violent protests and other incidents since Dec. 9.
   ``We are not issuing an advisory for Israel itself,'' Mrs.
Oakley said. ``Israel is safe for American travel.''
   However, with the statement coming during the Easter season,
which attracts many religious pilgrims to the area, the impact on
tourism and on Israel's economy could be severe.
   The West Bank was held by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt from 1949
until 1967 when the Arabs lost the territories to Israel in the
Six-Day War. About 96 percent of the population is Palestinian.
   The travel advisory cautioned Americans to avoid travel to the
areas ``until further notice.'' It said Americans living in the
areas ``should exercise particular caution.''
   The situation in East Jerusalem, which is part of Israel's
capital, was described as ``unpredictable.'' The advisory said
Americans should check with U.S. diplomats in the city before
entering the area.
   ``Under all circumstances, Americans should avoid demonstrations
and other situations that have the potential to lead to violence,''
the advisory said. ``American travelers should carry their U.S.
passports at all times.''
   Shultz will hold the meeting with Said and Abu-Lughud ``to
discuss our approach to the Middle East peace process,'' the
separate announcement said.
   He is trying to open negotiations on May 1 to provide self-rule
for the Palestinians. The PLO would not participate. However,
Palestinians with PLO approval would be part of a delegation with
Jordan.
   Mrs. Oakley stressed that Said and Abu-Lughud are U.S. citizens.
She said the U.S. policy of not dealing with the PLO itself
remained intact.
   ``There is no change in U.S. policy on negotiating with or
recognizing the PLO,'' she said. ``That policy remains as it has
been since 1975.''
   The United States, after persuading Israel to relinquish
territory to Egypt and Syria, promised in 1975 it would not deal
with the PLO. The pledge subsequently was incorporated in U.S. law.
   Asked if the PLO had given Said and Abu-Lughud permission to
meet with Shultz, Mrs. Oakley said: ``I have nothing on that.''
   She said Shultz initiated the meeting. ``He will discuss the
Palestinian point of view,'' she said. ``They have an intimate
knowledge of Middle Eastern politics.''
   Arad, the Israeli ambassador, telephoned M. Charles Hill, an
assistant to Shultz, to protest the meeting as a violation of the
pledge. Mrs. Oakley declined to describe the conversation.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Charles Shumer, D-N.Y., also contended
that the meeting would violate the pledge, which also was included
in law in 1984, and called on Shultz to reconsider it. Reps. Mel
Levine, D-Calif., and Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., also wrote the
secretary of their concern that the meeting ``might be seen as an
erosion of the U.S. position regarding the PLO.''
   However, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee lauded
the meeting as ``a reflection of the reality that legitimate
Palestinian representation is essential to any peace in the
region.''
   During a Mideast shuttle trip last month, Shultz tried to
arrange a meeting in Jerusalem with 15 Palestinian Arabs.
Apparently under PLO orders, none of them showed up.
   Shultz went to a hotel in East Jerusalem, stood in the floodlit
courtyard and read a statement suggesting the Palestinians were
fearful of working with the United States.
   ``Opportunity knocks loudly on your door,'' he said then. ``Now
is the time to get to work. We have a workable plan, and we are
ready to commit our efforts to it. The time is right, together, to
make decisions of historic proportions.''
   In January, Shultz met here with two Palestinian Arabs, Hanna
Siniora, a Jerusalem editor, and Fayez Abu Rahme, a Gaza lawyer.
   ``We feel we got his attention to the situation in the
territories,'' Siniora said afterward.
   Mrs. Oakley, meanwhile, confirmed the United States had
cautioned Israel not to take any action against Chinese missiles
delivered to Saudi Arabia. She refused to confirm reports the
Israeli air force has been conducting low-level practice bombing
runs.

   Riot police used water cannon
Friday to break up a Roman Catholic demonstration for religious
freedom held in downtown Bratislava in defiance of an official ban,
Western observers said.
   Clashes broke out when police tried to clear the square of
thousands of Catholics who gathered in front of the Notre Dame
Cathedral. Injuries and arrests were reported, but no figures were
available.
   Bratislava is a southern city near the Czechoslovak-Austrian
border.
   Witnesses said it took security troops and riot police about 45
minutes to push the Catholics, who were singing, praying and
holding candles, into side streets to end the protest.
   Two television teams, sent to Bratislava from the Austrian state
radio-television corporation, ORF, and the West German ARD station,
were seen being shoved by police and detained as Catholics gathered
on the square. They were prevented from filming the protest.
   Frantisek Miklosko, a Slovak Catholic activist, had told
authorities of plans for a peaceful rally and organizers were
expecting up to 70,000 people would take part.
   But communist authorities Thurday banned the demonstration,
saying it was ``an event guided from abroad'' and directed against
the socialist system.
   Protesters defied the ban, saying they wanted a free and
independent church and 10 bishops appointed to fill vacant
bishoprics throughout Czechoslovakia.
   Government officials have been arguing with the Vatican over the
vacancies. Organizers also wanted to show support for a petition
calling for separation of church and state and for free expression
of religion, which has been signed so far by more than 430,000
Czechoslovak Catholics.
   The Austrian TV crew was released after 2{ hours, ORF journalist
Otto Hoermann reported.
   In a broadcast telephone call from his car driving toward the
nearby border, Hoermann said he and his colleagues saw about 100
Catholics who were taken to police headquarters.
   ``They were totally drenched,'' he said, referring to police use
of road-cleaning trucks and water cannon. ``It has also been
raining. So Bratislava must be today the cleanest city in central
Europe.''
   Hoermann said he saw many police with clubs around Bratislava as
he drove from the city.
   Demonstrators began gathering at 3.30 p.m. A witness said
shortly before 6 p.m., when the crowd was several thousand strong,
people clutching candles sang the Slovak and Czech national anthems.
   Police began moving street-cleaning trucks and police cars
toward the square. Authorities used loudspeakers to urged
demonstrators to vacate the square, saying: ``This demonstration
has not been allowed according to state laws. Will you please
disperse?''
   But the appeal went unheeded. Police cars, six abreast, drove
through the crowd. The scene became chaotic as demonstrators
blocked off some of the cars.
   Elderly women, middle-aged people and youngsters were among
those resisting.
   Then came the street-cleaning trucks, spewing water.
   Most of the demonstrators stood fast on the square.
   Authorities brought in riot police and three water cannon
drenched the crowd. The demonstrators still were not entirely
dispersed, and security troops shoved people off the square,
herding them into side streets.
   Students were warned this week not to take part in the protest
and threatened with losing their place at universities and
dormitories, the Austrian Catholic news agency Kathpress reported
Wednesday.
   Kathpress said the organizers insisted the event was registered
officially as a ``peaceful assembly of citizens.''
   They were also quoted as saying, ``Is it unlawful to stage a
rally for religious freedom, observance of human rights and
appointment of bishops by the pope ?''
   The state news agency CTK later said members of illegal church
structures tried to organize a ``quiet religious demonstration,''
the aim of which was to abuse religious feelings of believers,
violate relations between the socialist state and the church, and
undermine negotiations with the Vatican.

   A strong earthquake shook a sparsely populated
area of the Northwest Territories on Friday. There were no reports
of injuries or damage.
   The quake registered 6.0 on the Richter scale and was centered
about 95 miles west of Fort Simpson, 750 miles northwest of
Edmonton, said Bob Wetmiller, a federal seismologist.
   An earthquake of that magnitude can do serious damage, but
Wetmiller said it was too far from populated areas to pose a danger.
   It struck 12:36 p.m. MST and was felt in communities several
hundred miles away, he said.
   The last earthquakes of that magnitude in the region were in
1985. One of 6.6 was reported Oct. 5 and another of 6.9 on Dec. 23
that year.
   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by
an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake with a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable damage in a
populated area; a magnitude 6 quake severe damage, one of magnitude
7 widespread, heavy damage and a magnitude 8 quake, a ``great''
earthquake capable of tremendous damage.
   A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans.

<TEXT>
   A scuba instructor was sentenced Friday
to 10 years in prison for fatally shooting his boss, who
authorities said was a suicidal millionaire who badgered and bribed
the employee to pull the trigger.
   Frederick Wisniewski, 27, of Linden had pleaded guilty to
aggravated manslaughter and aiding a suicide in the Nov. 25 death
of Julius ``Alex'' Bittmann, 44, of North Brunswick.
   ``I am sorry for it,'' Wisniewski told Superior Court Judge Paul
R. Kramer at sentencing.
   Wisniewski told authorities Bittmann badgered him for two months
before he agreed to kill him in return for $40,000 in cash and a
$60,000 Mercedes Benz.
   Wisniewski said Bittmann pleaded, ``Do it, do it!'' before he
killed Bittmann with a shot from a .357-caliber Magnum pistol in a
forest, authorities say. Bittmann had attempted suicide four times
previously, authorities said.
   Authorities said Wisniewski told them he drank a six-pack of
beer and some Scotch and snorted cocaine before going through with
Bittmann's request.
   Burlington County Prosecutor Stephen Raymond said the sentence
``sends out a clear message that this type of conduct isn't
excusable.''
   ``Julius Bittmann really did do everything but actually pull the
trigger,'' he said.
   Wisniewski will be eligible for parole after three years and
three months, authorities said.
   Bittmann owned a scuba shop in Edison where Wisniewski worked as
a diving instructor. Bittman amassed his fortune through several
businesses and real estate.
   Relatives and acquaintances have said that they do not know what
led to Bittmann's chronic depression, but that he had been taking
excessive amounts of anti-depressant drugs in recent years.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson denounced President Reagan and
George Bush on Friday for opposing civil rights legislation and
accused presidential rivals in both parties of ``not offering
leadership to stop the flow of drugs.''
   Jackson, striving for a win in a big industrial state,
campaigned at the county jail, inner-city union halls and a
suburban high school, blending his criticism of Republicans with
stirring calls to shun the ``short-term thrill, long-term chill''
of drugs.
   On the eve of Michigan's statewide Democratic presidential
caucuses, Jackson provided his own answer to those who ask what he
seeks to accomplish with a candidacy that is dogged by the
assumption he cannot win the nomination, even as he leads the
Democratic field in popular votes cast.
   ``People always ask, no matter how we're winning, what does
Jesse Jackson want,'' Jackson said before a crowd of more than
1,000 people, jammed into the United Auto Workers Local 212 next
door to a shut-down Chrysler plant.
   ``What does Jesse want? I want to wipe out illiteracy,'' he said.
   ``What do I want? I want to raise the minimum wage. What do I
want? I want comparable worth for women. ...
   ``I want head start and day care early on, rather than jail-fare
and welfare later on,'' Jackson said.
   He called Reagan's veto of legislation extending a civil rights
law, and Bush's support for that veto, ``an attempt to turn back
the clock.'' Congress on Tuesday overrode Reagan's veto of the
bill, which covers discrimination by institutions that use federal
money. Reagan argued that the legislation would expand federal
power.
   ``Any man who stands ... against civil rights restoration in
this country is not fit to lead our nation,'' Jackson said.
   Linking drugs to problems of inner cities such as the one where
he was campaigning, Jackson criticized Vice President Bush
repeatedly and noted Bush's position as head of the
administration's fight against drugs.
   ``George Bush ... he's over the drug commission, and offers no
leadership,'' Jackson said at the UAW hall.
   ``Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush, my competitors, are not offering
leadership to stop the flow of drugs,'' Jackson said.
   Later in Flint, Jackson named rivals Michael Dukakis and Albert
Gore Jr., and said he was outspent 50-to-1 by them in the South
``yet we got the most votes.''
   ``If they had my budget, they would surrender. If I had their
budget, they could not compete,'' he said.
   Jackson spoke at a Baptist church where the crowd was so large
people stood outside unable to get in. He also spoke in the parking
lot beside a UAW hall where Democrat Richard Gephardt spoke a day
earlier. Across the street was a GM auto assembly plant closed
three months ago, laying off some 3,500 workers.
   ``Foreign labor is not better labor, it's just cheaper labor,''
Jackson said. ``South Korea didn't take jobs from us, GM took jobs
to them.''
   At each stop Jackson gave careful instructions on how to vote in
Michigan's unusual caucus system. At one rally he called all the
young children in the crowd to gather around him.
   ``Who are you going to vote for?'' he asked them. ``Jesse,''
they responded.
   Jackson was running in a tight Michigan race with Dukakis,
according to most polls in Michigan, with Gephardt running third in
a state where he must win.
   Jackson, the black civil rights activist, is counting on doing
well in heavily black Detroit, even though the city's black mayor,
Coleman Young, is backing Dukakis.
   A Jackson victory in Michigan would be a major achievement for
his candidacy in a state of the industrial North _ one where only
16 years ago George Wallace won a stunning Democratic primary
victory.
   He spoke in a Detroit neighborhood not far from empty factories,
vacant lots and gutted storefronts.
   ``What does it matter to have civil rights, if you can march
downtown but can't walk down your own neighborhood streets?''
Jackson asked.
   Hours earlier, he visited the Wayne County jail and met with
about 30 inmates, all facing misdemeanor charges, and urged them to
use their time to read and learn and to reject drugs.
   ``Just because you're down, you don't have to be out; you can
change your situation,'' he said.
   Jackson urged the inmates to ask for absentee ballots and vote
in the presidential balloting being conducted at Saturday's
caucuses.

   A doctor said Friday he was looking out his
office window when he saw his house passing before his eyes.
   It was on a flatbed truck, headed out of town with a police
escort.
   ``I ran down the street and yelled, `Hey, where are you going
with my house?''' Dr. Frank Calabro, a general practitioner and
part owner of a real estate business, said in relating Thursday's
events.
   ``The cop looked at me like I was crazy,'' said Calabro, 55.
   ``This is your house, mister?'' the officer asked.
   ``This is a house-napping,'' Calabro told him.
   The officer stopped the convoy and walked to the back to talk to
the man who had ordered the house moved. He was gone.
   ``We all stood in the street laughing,'' said Calabro. ``It
seemed so ridiculous. Who would steal a house?''
   The answer, provided by the boss of the flatbed truck, was a guy
who sold it to someone else for $500, then hired the mover to
deliver it.
   ``The concept of a man's home being his castle has been shaken
to its very foundation,'' Suffolk County District Attorney Patrick
Henry said.
   The two-bedroom yellow beach house with a white door had been
placed on runners for removal because Calabro had sold it _ a
$12,000 value _ earlier in the week.

<HEAD>Documents Show Waldheim Transcribed, Forwarded Order To Kill
Partisans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, while
serving in the German army, received and then forwarded Adolf
Hitler's order to kill captured Greek partisans, according to
documents released Friday.
   The documents from the U.S. National Achives are Waldheim's army
group's war diary and a corresponding Nuremberg War Trial document.
They were provided by the World Jewish Congress.
   ``The chief witness against Kurt Waldheim is the one he can
never refute _ his own name on the captured Nazi war records,''
said Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish
Congress.
   John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman, confirmed Friday
that the war diary and Nuremberg records were among documents used
in deciding to place Waldheim on the ``watchlist'' that bars
undesirable aliens from the United States.
   The Austrian government has protested that the U.S. government
has not disclosed the documents. Waldheim, U.N. secretary-general
from 1972 to 1982, has denied committing any war crimes, although
his army unit was accused of them.
   Waldheim served with the German army during World War II in the
occupied Balkans. He was a lieutenant in the German General Staff
attached to the 11th Italian Army in Athens.
   The documents show that on Aug. 8, 1943, Waldheim entered
Hitler's order to kill captured Greek partisans in his army group's
war diary in Athens and on the same day transmitted the order by
radio to a German division in the field.
   The diary entry signed by Waldheim said: ``According to a new
Fuehrer order bandits (partisans) captured in battle are to be
shot. Others suspected of banditry, etc., are to be taken prisoner
and sent to Germany for use in labor details.'' The translation was
provided by the World Jewish Congress.
   The word ``bandit'' was used to describe partisans.
   The Nuremberg document shows the actual transmission of the
order: ``To the 1st Mountain Division: Reference Teletype Ia No.
959-43 Secret of 7 Aug. 1943 concerning shooting of bandits. A new
Fuehrer order is at hand, which will be transmitted. Bandits taken
in battle are to be shot. Other bandit suspects etc. are to be
arrested and evacuated for `Sauckel' labor service.''
   SS Gen. Fritz Sauckel, sentenced to death at Nuremberg, ran a
network of slave labor camps. The 1st Mountain Division was
operating against the anti-Nazi resistance in northern Greece.
   Steinberg said the documents were made available at this time
because Waldheim, despite his protests, has failed to appeal the
``watchlist'' decision.
   ``These documents demonstrate the basis for that decision and
the evidence is devastating,'' he said.
   An Austrian ``white book'' rebutting charges against Waldheim
makes brief reference to the war diary but does not mention his
role in forwarding the Hitler order and does not mention the
Nuremberg document.
   Steinberg said that in the ``white book'' Waldheim ``ignores
half the diary entry which says these instructions on treatment of
bandits are being transmitted.''
   The World Jewish Congress located the Waldheim war diary and
Nuremberg document at the U.S. National Archives in 1986 and turned
them over to the Justice Department.
   A commission of historians appointed by the Austrian government
issued a report earlier this year saying Waldheim was in a position
to know of atrocities but did not try to stop them.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree To Allow US Psychiatrists To Visit Soviet Mental
Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials agreed in principle during a
human rights conference that ended Friday to allow American
psychiatrists to visit Soviet mental hospitals, a high-ranking
State Department official said.
   That could lead to examination by Americans of Soviets believed
to be incarcerated in mental institutions solely because they are
dissidents.
   Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
said the agreement was reached during a unique ``roundtable
discussion'' between Soviet and U.S. psychiatrists and legal
experts.
   The purpose of the conference, from the American side, was to
press the Soviets to put into practice recent pledges to improve
human rights, to allow judicial review of government actions
affecting human rights and to explore ways the Soviets could
moderate policies on capital punishment, control of religious
activity and use of mental hospitals.
   Unlike the United States, where commitment is a legal process,
the Soviet Union permits incarceration in a mental hospital if two
psychiatrists sign the order.
   For years, the United States, Soviet activists and psychiatrists
around the world have accused the Russians of using the system to
lock up dissidents who are perfectly sane. The practice has
reportedly been stopped in new cases, but Schifter said: ``there
are certain persons whose names have come up _ still in psychiatric
institutions _ who in the opinion of a great many people may be
there for reasons other than their mental health.''
   Under the agreement at the conference, in addition to visiting
the Soviet institutions, there may be requests for visiting
psychiatrists to examine specific patients, Schifter said. ``I
consider that a possibility.''
   Soviet psychiatrists will also visit U.S. mental institutions.
   Schifter said the U.S. government would not be involved in the
exchanges, but would leave all arrangements to private psychiatric
groups.
   At the conference, Schifter said, the Soviets also were willing
to discuss the issue of capital punishment. He said the Soviet
Union performs 10 times as many executions as are carried out in
the United States each year and that there have been some
indications Moscow is examining whether to continue applying the
death penalty for major economic crimes.
   He said the U.S. participants also suggested the Soviets
consider dropping use of capital punishment in national security
cases. The last spies executed in the United States were Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted in the early 1950s of giving
atomic bomb secrets to Russia.
   Among the participants in the roundtable _ the first conference
of its type under a 1975 agreement to hold them _ were Loren Roth,
of the Western Psychiatric Institute, Roger Peele, director of St.
Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and Frank Kaufman, a federal
judge in Baltimore.
   The Soviet delegates included Anatoliy L. Adamishin, the deputy
foreign minister, Vasiliy A. Vlasikhin, of the USA-Canada Institute
and Gennadily N. Milekhin, of the Serbskiy Institute, a Soviet
hospital.
   Paul Kamenar of the Washington Legal Foundation said the chief
accomplishment of the conference was ``the recognition by the
Soviets that they have shortcomings; that they have problems.'' He
said the Soviets agreed to hold several workshops on human rights
and appeared to be eager to talk about the rights situation.
   ``Talk is cheap, but this is a beginning and we'll see where it
goes,'' Kamenar said.

   President Oscar Arias hailed a
60-day cease-fire between the Nicaraguan government and rebels as
offering a ``a new and firm hope that all Central Americans can
live in peace.''
   The presidents of Mexico and Guatemala, meeting Friday at
Mexico's Caribbean resort of Cancun to discuss the cease-fire
accord, denounced what they called foreign interference and
military threats in Central America.
   They did not specifically name the United States, but their
remarks appeared directed at Washington.
   ``Mexico is demanding absolute respect for the sovereignty of
peoples'' in Central America, Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid
said in a speech welcoming President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala.
   Cuba, which along with the Soviet Union has been helping
Nicaragua with military advisers and weapons, called the truce
agreement a hope for peace but said it would not undermine the
revolutionary principles of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
   In a dispatch, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina noted that
President Reagan said he welcomed the agreement between Nicaragua
and the rebels, but that he also added there ``is reason to have
caution'' because of the Sandinistas' past actions.
   ``It would not be surprising if the United States would now
exert pressure on the Contra leaders to abhor the agreement with
Managua and force them to retake the path of war,'' Prensa Latina
said in its dispatch, received Friday in Mexico City.
   Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drawing up a
Central American peace plan that calls for cease-fires in the
region's wars, said Thursady he believes the Nicaraguan agreement
can succeed.
   ``I want to be optimistic and trust the good faith of those who
signed the document,'' he said.
   The agreement was signed Wednesday in the Nicaraguan border town
of Sapoa, near the Costa Rican border.
   ``If an effective cease-fire is achieved for 60 days and can be
extended there is no reason whatsoever not to advance in fulfilling
the other points'' in the peace plan, he said.
   The peace plan, signed by the five Central American presidents
last Aug. 7 in Guatemala, also calls for democratic reforms,
amnesties and an end to outside aid to insurgencies.
   Arias said the region's conflicts also must be dealt with by the
United States and Soviet Union ``who will have to do their share so
that they get their hands out of Central America.''
   De la Madrid and Cerezo are to hold two days of talks in Cancun.
High on their agenda is the Nicaraguan pact and U.S. efforts to
force Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega out of
office.
   ``We observe with worry how in Central America military threats
and foreign interference are taking on a new impulse ... along with
economic aggression and military intimidation,'' de la Madrid said
in his welcoming speech.
   Cerezo, referring to U.S. troops in Honduras, said, ``We are
ready to do everything possible so that the nations of the world
learn to respect us and to help other peoples of the world become
masters of their own destinities.''
   The Reagan administration sent 3,200 American soldiers to
Honduras last week at the request of Honduran President Jose Azcona
Hoyo, who accused Nicaraguan troops of crossing the border into his
country to attack base camps of the U.S.-backed Contras.
   Nicaragua denied its troops had entered Honduras. Honduran
officials said earlier this week the Sandinistas had withdrawn.
   De la Madrid and Cerezo made no mention of the Nicaraguan
cease-fire agreement in their remarks at Cancun.
   Arias told a news conference Thursday in San Jose the United
States was not justified in sending troops to Honduras and there
was no reason for them to remain there any longer.
   He also said he had discussed with Cerezo the possibility of
another meeting of Central American presidents.
   ``There is much to talk about and clarify,'' he said, but did
not elaborate.

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 3,200-man American
expeditionary force that flew here last week during a
Honduran-Nicaraguan border crisis will start returning to the
United States on Monday, military intelligence sources said.
   The sources said the first troops of the 82nd Airborne Division,
based at Fort Bragg, N.C., will return Monday and the entire force
will be back home within two or three days after.
   There was no immediate confirmation from U.S. military spokesmen
here. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Americans were deployed here from the United States in a
dramatic show of force after President Jose Azcona Hoyo asked for
help, charging that Nicarguan forces had penetrated Honduran
territory while chasing U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Honduran government officials said tensions had subsided along
the border and that the Sandinista troops had withdrawn.
   ``It's peaceful on the border,'' presidential spokesman Lisandro
Quesada said. ``There are no Sandinista troops in Honduras.''
   Honduras has reported several smaller incursions since the
arrival of paratroopers from Fort Bragg and light infantry from
Fort Ord, Calif., on March 17-18.
   The U.S. forces continued joint training exercises Friday with
Honduran troops at four bases throughout the country, Cap. Brian
DeLoche, a public affairs officer at Palmerola Air Base said.
   DeLoche said the soldiers expected to go home next week, but
were still awaiting orders. DeLoche spoke by telephone from the
base, about 40 milies northwest of the capital of Tegucigalpa.
   Deployment of the reinforcements brought U.S. military strength
in Honduras to more than 6,000, alarming even the friendly
governments in the region.
   The Sandinistas accused the United States of either preparing to
invade Nicaragua or using the training exercises to cover up the
delivery of arms and equipment for the Contras, whose U.S. military
aid was cut off by Congress last month.
   Some congresmen voiced similar suspicions about the equipment
brought here with the troops, including combat helicopters and
large quantities of weapons.
   Auditors from the General Accounting Office, Congress' watchdog,
were to come to Palmerola to make sure the equipment went home with
the troops.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael O'Brien said the auditors were
coming at the request of several U.S. lawmakers. Neither he nor
DeLoche could say when the auditors were due in Honduras.
   Since the troops' arrival, there have been major developments in
the six-year war between Nicaragua's leftist government the rebels.
The two sides agreed Wednesday to a 60-day cease-fire as a prelude
to talks on permanent peace.
   Meanwhile, Honduran military air reconnaissance Thursday of the
frontier in Olancho and El Paraiso provinces detected no Sandinista
activity in Honduras, said Eugenio Castro, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
   The ministry had filed what it called an ``energetic protest''
with Nicaragua Thursday over what it said were two border
incursions involving a total of about 350 Sandinistas this week.
   No confrontations were reported.
   In Guatemala, a meeting of representatives of the five Central
American nations who signed a regional peace accord on Aug. 7,
1987, apparently broke down over the issue of U.S. troops.
   Nicaragua demanded withdrawal of U.S. troops from Honduras and
Honduras countered by demanding that Nicaragua withdraw a complaint
filed with the World Court in The Hague, Netherlands. The complaint
accuses Honduras and Costa Rica of harboring Contras.

   Torrential rains swept across
central Argentina Friday and civil defense officials reported six
storm-related deaths. They said flooding forced the evacuation of
about 20,000 people.
   Two women were electrocuted by downed power lines as they tried
to cross streets in suburban Buenos Aires, according to the
officials. They said a 19-year-old woman drowned in Villa Ponsati
and three people drowned in Florencio Varela _ two girls ages 3 and
4 and a 24-year-old man.
   It was the second day of haevy rains. Among those evacuated were
many of the 11,000 residents of Moron and Quilmes near Buenos Aires.
   Flooding disrupted rail and road transportation and telephone
service.
   There were widespread power outages in Buenos Aires, which has a
population of 10 million, and the port city of La Plata, 30 miles
south of the capital.
   Weather forecasters said the rains could continue through Sunday.

<HEAD>Bar Becomes Symbol for `Preppie' Lifestyle</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chambers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On Aug. 25, 1986, Dorrian's Red Hand was just
another Upper East Side bar catering to the young and upwardly
mobile: a hangout for yuppies and preppies, where the Izod crowd
came to knock back a few.
   Twenty-four hours later, all that changed.
   With the death of Jennifer Dawn Levin early on the morning of
Aug. 26, Dorrian's became _ fairly or unfairly _ a symbol of
youthful decadence, of teen-agers with too much money and no place
to go.
   Among them was Robert Chambers, who sat at the bar drinking
shots of tequila with beer chasers the night he killed Miss Levin.
   ``He fouled everybody's life up,'' bar owner John F. ``Jack''
Dorrian said recently. ``Who needs this guy?''
   After Miss Levin's death, investigators returned to Dorrian's
and closed the bar for 10 days for serving underage patrons in
November 1986. Dorrian has put the bar up for sale; no buyer has
been found.
   Chambers, now 21, had been a regular at Dorrian's. He also was a
college dropout who had a very proper upbringing.
   Dinner at the Chambers house, located next to the former Andrew
Carnegie mansion a few blocks north of Dorrian's, ``always had
silver involved,'' said Ralph Destino, a friend of Chambers,
shortly after his arrest.
   Chambers apparently had no steady job at the time of his arrest,
yet was drinking and flirting ``five or six nights a week'' at
Dorrian's, said its owner.
   Interviews in the months since the slaying indicate Dorrian's
remains attractive, a place where young people can gather in front
of an ornate fireplace and play backgammon at the tables.
   Regulars said they avoided Dorrian's after Miss Levin died,
fearing the bar had been taken over by the curious. But the young
men and women who grew up in the wealthy neighborhood and knew one
another in the best prep schools came back.
   Miss Levin was not a regular at Dorrian's but was known there.
Patrons don't talk much about the case, they said.
   ``I come here when I feel like sitting around like I'm in my
living room,'' said Alyssa Donati, 21, who said she has been
frequenting Dorrian's for five years.
   Dorrian himself knows who's who in the bar; he can point out the
child of a well-known writer and the daughter of a presidential
adviser. John Zaccaro Jr., son of ex-Democratic vice presidential
nominee Geraldine Ferraro, was tending bar the night of the death.
   Chambers would no longer be welcome, Dorrian said. Other
regulars would say tourists, out-of-towners and the curious are not
welcome either.
   ``Parents like their kids to come here,'' Miss Donati said 17
months after Miss Levin's death. ``Here they know the people are
from at least good families, they've been to good colleges, and
they're not out to rape people.''

<TEXT>
   An attempt by two U.S.
adventurers to circle the Earth in a balloon in 9 to 14 days was
scuttled Friday by bad weather, officials said.
   The attempt by John Petrehn and Rowland Smith, both of Kansas,
to launch their 360-foot-high balloon from Mendoza was canceled by
heavy rains, and poor weather forecast this weekend jeopardizes the
entire project, said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Patricia Rosker.
   Torrential rains lashed central Argentina from the Atlantic to
the Andes for the second day and officials on Friday blamed the
storms for six deaths. Weather forecasters said the rain would
continue through Sunday.
   Ms. Rosker said of the balloonists, ``The last word I have is
that they're planning to launch on Tuesday. That will be the final
day. After that, the project will have to be canceled, which would
be a pity because of all the effort they've put into this.''
   The balloonists are trying to do what no one else has: Circle
the Earth around the 45-degree parallel in the Southern Hemisphere
using longitudinal winds that carry them to the east, Ms. Rosker
said.
   Petrehn, head of the project, is a 52-year-old businessman from
Topeka, Kan., while Smith, 50, is a former Vietnam War pilot and a
Kansas-based pilot for Trans World Airlines.
   They chose Mendoza, 660 miles west of Buenos Aires as their
launch and landing site because ``apparently it was the part of the
world where there are more days of sun and good weather and because
it had good wind conditions,'' Ms. Rosker said.
   The balloonists have received about $2.5 million in donations
for the project, which includes scientific experiments measuring
ozone levels along the 45th parallel, she said.
   They plan to ride in a specially devised gondola. It contains a
small porthole for a window, a bed and one chair. They plan to
maintain contact along the route with radar and sophisticated radio
equipment, she said.
   ``It has a small window like a mini-sub and is quite
uncomfortable. Also very dangerous because practically all the time
they will be flying over water with no help. If a storm arises and
it's not predicted by satellite, they will be in trouble,'' she
said.
   Two balloons, one of hot air and the other of helium, will ride
piggyback above the gondola, allowing the craft to rise and fall by
opening valves of hot air as it travels east with the prevailing
winds, Ms. Rosker said.
   ``They can reach an altitude of 30,000 feet. The gondola is
pressurized for their comfort and they will use the same type of
food as astronauts, dehydrated food and lots of water,'' she said.
   According to Petrehn, Smith and members of the crew of 24 that
helped bring the balloons and gondola to Argentina, the flight
would be the first non-stop, unrefueled, manned balloon trip around
the world.
   The craft's intended flight from El Plumerillo air base outside
Mendoza would take it over the Atlantic, about 200 miles south of
Africa, across the Indian Ocean, south of Australia, over the
southern New Zealand island of Campbell Island to Chile where it
would cross the Andes and arrive back in Argentina after 17,545
miles.
   Petrehn and Smith said the longest manned balloon flight was
that of the Double Eagle V, which in 1981 crossed the Pacific and
covered about 5,000 miles.

<TEXT>
   Robert Chambers pleaded guilty to a lesser
charge of manslaughter Friday for strangling a young woman during
sex in Central Park, halting jury deliberations in the ``preppie
murder'' case after nine days.
   State Supreme Court Justice Howard E. Bell asked Chambers
whether he intended to cause ``serious injury'' to 18-year-old
Jennifer Levin ``and thereby cause her death.'' State law defines
first-degree manslaughter as causing a death while intending to
cause serious injury.
   ``Looking back on everything, I have to say yes,'' Chambers, 21,
said. ``It breaks my heart to have to say that.''
   At that, prosecutor Linda Fairstein shot up and said loudly,
``We're asking about his mind and his hands, not his heart.'' The
judge repeated the question, and Chambers replied, ``Yes.''
   Chambers' mother, Phyllis Chambers, stared straight ahead,
showing no emotion. His father, Robert, also sat silently.
   Miss Levin's death in the summer of 1986 focused attention on
the lives of wealthy young New Yorkers. It also drew protests from
feminists, who argued that Chambers' defense was an example of
blaming women for male violence.
   Chambers had maintained that he never intended to hurt Miss
Levin, whom he had dated before, and killed her accidentally with a
swipe of his arm when she hurt him during rough sex. The sexual
encounter was not their first.
   Chambers originally was charged with second-degree murder, which
carries a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
   Under a plea bargain, he will be sentenced to five to 15 years.
He could have received up to eight and one-third to 25 years on the
charge. Sentencing was set for April 15.
   The plea bargain, reached after two days of negotiations, came
as the jury was in its ninth day of deliberations. Chambers' trial
began with jury selection Oct. 21. Opening arguments started Jan. 4.
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said that the
prospect of a possible mistrial, the strain on the Levin family and
the circumstantial nature of the evidence prompted the plea bargain.
   ``I'll feel better tomorrow when he's in jail, where he should
be,'' said Ellen Levin, Jennifer's mother. ``He wasn't the
lily-white altar boy he appeared to be.''
   Chambers, who was free on $157,500 bail during the trial, will
surrender Saturday morning, said his attorney, Jack Litman.
   Chambers also pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary in an
unrelated indictment, with his sentence to run concurrent with his
manslaughter sentence.
   One juror said the votes on the murder charge swung from 8-4 for
acquittal to 9-3 for conviction, and the last vote was 7-5 for
acquittal. But he said he felt the jury could have reached a
verdict. The judge had sealed the jurors' names, and the juror who
spoke would identify himself only as Mike.
   When lawyers involved in the burglary case appeared earlier in
the day, prompting speculation about a plea bargain, Miss Levin's
grandfather Arnold Domenitz, 72, said he found such talk
``sickening.''
   ``If that wasn't so tragic, it would be funny,'' he said.
   Shortly after Miss Levin's body was found, Chambers told police
in a videotaped statement that she had ``molested'' him sexually
and hurt his genitals.
   For four hours during his closing argument, Litman appealed to
the jury to acquit Chambers. ``What he was doing was reacting to
the pain,'' Litman said. ``He was trying to stop her'' and the
result was a ``tragic accident.''
   Fairstein called the story ``ludicrous.'' She said he attacked
Miss Levin in a rage, punched her, chased her when she tried to
flee, caught her and ``squeezed the life out of her.''
   Fairstein, holding a photo of Miss Levin taken in a bar hours
before her death, told the jury: ``One can't help but look at that
photograph and pray for time to stand still, for time to grab her
and say, `Don't go with Robert Chambers.'''
   The judge told the jury that while ``motive is not an element of
the crime charged here,'' the lack of one is a circumstance from
which they might infer innocence.
   Fairstein had been hard put to offer a motive, and suggested
Chambers strangled Miss Levin after an argument which started when
he was impotent after a night of drinking.
   ``Perhaps he couldn't perform because he had too many beers and
shots of tequila that night,'' she said.
   At 11:30 p.m. Aug. 25, 1986, Chambers arrived at Dorrian's Red
Hand. The bar-restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side, in the
heart of one of the city's wealthiest areas, was popular among
privileged young people, many of them younger than New York's legal
drinking age of 21.
   The atmosphere, bartender John Zacarro Jr. testified, was
festive. Patrons on their way to colleges table-hopped, embraced
friends and laughed.
   That night Chambers, a Boston University dropout, talked with
Miss Levin, who was planning to go to college that fall. They left
together.
   The prosecution presented 25 witnesses and 120 exhibits,
including many color photos of Miss Levin's bruised and nearly nude
body beneath a tree behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art where she
was found by a bicyclist at daybreak.
   The prosecutor argued the victim's left eye, red and swollen,
and the fracture in a small bone in Chambers' hand show that the
defendant assaulted her with ``hands as deadly as any arsenal.''

<HEAD>Landmark Casino and Last of Hughes' Gaming Empire Sold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harolds Club, the last remaining property in
the gaming empire of the late Howard Hughes, has been sold, it was
announced Friday.
   The Lincoln Group, which owns Fitzgeralds hotel-casino across
the street from Harolds and operates the Nevada Club next door,
announced the purchase from Hughes Properties Inc. The price was
not disclosed.
   Harolds Club was founded in 1935 by gaming pioneer Harold Smith.
   Hughes arrived in Las Vegas in 1966 and began buying gaming
properties the following year with the purchase of the Desert Inn.
Within a few years he owned the Desert Inn, the Landmark, the
Frontier, the Sands, the Silver Slipper and the Castaways in Las
Vegas and Harolds Club. The reclusive billionaire died in 1976.
   Lincoln Group President Phil Griffith, who was president of
Harolds Club from 1978 until 1984, called the purchase ``a project
close to our hearts.'' The Lincoln Group also owns Fitzgerald's
hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
   The Lincoln Group said it will take over Harolds on May 31 and
close it for about a month for remodeling.
   Hughes revolutionized gaming in the late 1960s by introducing
corporate ownership into a business previously dominated by
individual owners like Smith.
   Hughes' company in December sold its last two Las Vegas
properties, the Frontier and the Silver Slipper.
   Earlier last year, it sold the Desert Inn and Sands resorts to
financier Kirk Kerkorian and previously sold the Castaways to
Golden Nugget owner Steven Wynn.

<HEAD>War Criminals Wanted: Britain Advertises For Nazi Info</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government began using newspaper ads Friday to
drum up information about Nazi war criminals, apparently in reponse
to charges it has not been energetic in pursuing perpetrators of
World War II atrocities.
   ``War Criminals _ Evidence Wanted,'' read the heading of the ad
that appeared in the Times of London and other papers with national
circulations.
   The advertisements were taken out by a special war crimes
inquiry panel set up after the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center
accused the British government of failing to seek and prosecute war
criminals.
   ``It is alleged that some war criminals responsible for
genocide, murder or manslaughter in Germany or German-occupied
territories during the Second World War are in the (United
Kingdom),'' the ad says.
   ``Others with British nationality may be living elsewhere in the
world. The names of some suspects have already been sent to the
Home Office.''
   The advertisements say that when the inquiry is complete, Home
Minister Douhlas Hurd will advise the government ``whether there is
sufficient evidence to justify the prosecution of the alleged
offenders.''
   They ask anyone with ``any information that you think may be
relevant'' to write the Home Office. The ads are to be repeated in
newspapers Sunday.
   The inquiry panel is headed by the former director of public
prosecutions, Sir Thomas Hetherington, and William Chambers, a
former senior government official in Scotland.
   Hetherington and Chambers will spend a year investigating
evidence and interviewing people with information in Britain and
abroad, including the Soviet Union.
   Efrain Zuroff, director of the Wiesenthal Center's Israel
office, last month gave British officials the names of two more
alleged war criminals and more evidence against nine suspects the
government already confirmed are living in Britain.
   Zuroff said at that time that the center expects dozens of
suspected war criminals living in Britain and other Western
countries to stand trial within 18 months as new legal changes
close in on the suspects.
   He said in an interview in London last month that, before Hurd
set up the inquiry, Britain was the only major Western country that
refused to take any action against alleged war criminals.
   The Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal center has submitted the names
of a total of 256 suspects to eight countries _ Australia, Brazil,
Britain, Canada, Sweden, the United States, Venezuela and West
Germany _ where they are alleged to have fled after the war ended
in 1945.
   The suspects are mainly from the Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania,
all now part of the Soviet Union. They are accused of collaborating
with Nazi invaders in killing Jews and others.
   British-resident suspects include a former Lithuanian platoon
commander, 71-year-old Antanas Gecas, who lives in Edinburgh,
Scotland.
   The Wiesenthal center alleges Gecas killed more Jews than Klaus
Barbie, the so-called Butcher of Lyon. Gecas, a retired mining
engineer, says he is innocent and the accusations have wrecked his
life.
   The Wiesenthal center tracked down the suspects, mostly over age
70, after gaining access to international immigration data in late
1986.
   West Germany and the United States are probing cases identified
by the center, while Australia and Canada set up inquiry
commissions and changed their laws recently to allow prosecutions.
   Zuroff charged last month that Brazil, Sweden and Venezuela have
done little or nothing to trace the individuals or prosecute.

   Gov. Evan Mecham, fighting charges he
misused $80,000 from a ``protocol fund'' by loaning it to his auto
dealership, testified Friday he was told he could use the money for
practically ``any damn thing that you want.''
   The first-term Republican said he had never heard the money
referred to as public funds.
   Testimony at the governor's Senate impeachment trial in recent
days has focused on his borrowing at 9 percent interest money that
had been raised by his inaugural ball.
   State law had barred him from using the money to pay off
campaign debts, and a ``protocol fund'' was set up instead last
year. Witnesses said the fund was intended to promote Arizona
through events and gifts to visiting dignitaries.
   The prosecution contends the fund was public money; the defense
contends that it was private and that it was borrowed because
Mecham's dealership was in desperate financial straits.
   Mecham said he received instructions on use of the money from
William Long, chairman of Mecham's inaugural committee, which had
raised the funds before learning they could not be used to retire
campaign debts.
   ``Mr. Long said, `We have gone through all of this rigamarole
and you can spend it for any damn thing that you want,' those were
his words, `except you can't spend it for politics or personal
living expenses,''' Mecham testified.
   ``I never heard the words discussed, `public funds,''' the
63-year-old governor said under questioning by his attorney, Jerris
Leonard.
   A key piece of evidence in the case is a letter of agreement
signed by Long and the Maricopa County attorney agreeing that money
placed in the fund could be used only to promote the interests of
Arizona and encourage public service.
   However, Long, in an affidavit submitted by the defense Friday,
said he ``did not intend to transfer these monies as a gift to the
state of Arizona.''
   The misuse of funds charge is the second of three impeachment
counts before the Senate, which earlier heard testimony on an
allegation Mecham attempted to obstruct an investigation of an
alleged death threat. The governor has also been accused of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in
six decades, also faces a recall election May 17 and a criminal
trial April 21 on charges of concealing the $350,000 loan.
   Mecham, who took the stand shortly before the trial recessed for
the weekend, began answering allegations that his Mecham Pontiac
dealership was in financial trouble and needed the $80,000 borrowed
in July.
   He and his attorney presented documents that they said showed
the company had an unencumbered net value of $2.5 million at the
time. A prosecution accountant had testified the company owed more
than it was worth.
   Asked about a $101,900 loan that was in default last summer,
Mecham said that was a mistake.
   ``Quite frankly, I wasn't watching my details,'' he said. ``I
was a little red faced when they caught up with me and I took care
of it.''
   In testimony earlier Friday, Mecham's son denied the family car
business was in financial distress when the $80,000 loan was made
in July.
   Dennis Mecham, 37, who took over as general manager of Mecham
Pontiac when his father was elected in 1986, supported his father's
statement that he borrowed the money only so it would earn higher
interest than it was getting.
   ``He called up and asked if I could use $80,000 in the
dealership operation,'' Dennis Mecham recalled of his talk with his
father last July. ``I said yes. I'd say yes to anyone who had
$80,000 to loan me.''
   ``He said it was the inaugural fund and it was just sitting
there,'' the younger Mecham recalled. ``He wanted to roughly double
the interest it was getting.
   ``I needed the money, but the rate of interest had to be
reasonable. I didn't want him to stiff me,'' the younger Mecham
said with a laugh. ``Of course, I knew he wouldn't.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 guerrillas blew a
hole in the wall of El Salvador's largest prison Friday, entered
the compound and fought guards in a half-hour battle that left two
people dead, officers reported.
   Gen. Rinaldo Golcher, deputy security minister, told reporters
about 10 prisoners escaped from the Mariona penitentiary just north
of the capital of San Salvador as the lestist guerrillas withdrew.
No guerrilla casualties were reported.
   Officials did not give a breakdown on the number of common
criminals and the number of rebels held in Mariona, a facility that
normally holds 1,000 prisoners.
   Seven guards were wounded by rifle fire and grenade shrapnel and
``some prisoners'' also were injured, Golcher said. ``There are
probably some dead,'' he added.
   A guard interviewed by journalists as he left the prison said
two civilian employees were killed. Some inmates set fires as the
left-wing rebels launched their attack in the early afternoon,
according to the guard.
   He said ``about 200'' guerrillas made the assault and Golcher
reported a large number managed to get into the prison grounds
during the ``very strong'' attack.
   A first-aid worker said three civilian employees suffered
serious bullet wounds and were taken by ambulances to hospitals.
   Journalists were kept hundreds of yards away from the
penitentiary as scores of soldiers were rushed to the prison. Two
helicopters flew over the compound.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed government
since 1979.

   The misuse of funds charge is the second of three impeachment
counts before the Senate, which earlier heard testimony on an
allegation Mecham attempted to obstruct an investigation of an
alleged death threat. The governor has also been accused of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in
six decades, also faces a recall election May 17 and a criminal
trial April 21 on charges of concealing the $350,000 loan.
   Mecham, who took the stand shortly before the trial recessed for
the weekend, began answering allegations that his Mecham Pontiac
dealership was in financial trouble and needed the $80,000 borrowed
in July.
   He and his attorney presented documents that they said showed
the company had an unencumbered net value of $2.5 million at the
time. A prosecution accountant had testified the company owed more
than it was worth.
   Asked about a $101,900 loan that was in default last summer,
Mecham said that was a mistake.
   ``Quite frankly, I wasn't watching my details,'' he said. ``I
was a little red faced when they caught up with me and I took care
of it.''
   In testimony earlier Friday, Mecham's son denied the family car
business was in financial distress when the $80,000 loan was made
in July.
   Dennis Mecham, 37, who took over as general manager of Mecham
Pontiac when his father was elected in 1986, supported his father's
statement that he borrowed the money only so it would earn higher
interest than it was getting.
   ``He called up and asked if I could use $80,000 in the
dealership operation,'' Dennis Mecham recalled of his talk with his
father last July. ``I said yes. I'd say yes to anyone who had
$80,000 to loan me.''
   ``He said it was the inaugural fund and it was just sitting
there,'' the younger Mecham recalled. ``He wanted to roughly double
the interest it was getting.
   ``I needed the money, but the rate of interest had to be
reasonable. I didn't want him to stiff me,'' the younger Mecham
said with a laugh. ``Of course, I knew he wouldn't.''

<HEAD>Attorney Says Documents Prove Army LSD Testing On Torture-Murder
Defendant</HEAD>

   The lawyer for a man accused of murdering
two women and shackling four others in a basement torture chamber
said Friday he has obtained files that will prove his client was
the subject of Army LSD tests in the 1960s.
   ``I found that my client was a guinea pig for the U.S. Army and
it will be proven beyond any doubt,'' A. Charles Peruto Jr. said.
``If I were to pay rent on the files by the square foot, I'd be
broke.''
   One year ago, police found three half-naked women chained to a
sewer pipe in the basement of Gary Heidnik's house after being led
there by a woman who said she had escaped from the captor.
   Limbs of another woman were found packaged in the freezer and
another body was found in a New Jersey forest.
   Peruto said he plans to argue during the trial set to begin
April 4 that Heidnik was insane and the hallucinogen LSD aggravated
his schizophrenia.
   Peruto said Army and Veterans Administration documents show
Heidnik was the subject of LSD tests between 1961 and 1963.
   An Army spokesman said the service's records did not show such
testing.
   ``Nothing exists in his Army record on file. It is not known
what is part of his record on file with the Veterans
Administration,'' said Lt. Col. Greg Rixon in Washington.
   Calls to the VA late Friday afternoon went unanswered.
   The VA granted Heidnik 100 percent psychiatric disability after
he was discharged from the Army in 1963. The Pentagon has said the
Army initially set the diability level much lower after concluding
Heidnik's condition pre-dated his induction.
   In another development Friday, Peruto withdrew an agreement with
Heidnik's creditors that would have assigned two-thirds of book and
movie profits to his alleged victims. The other third would go to
Peruto in lieu of attorney's fees.
   Peruto said he withdrew the arrangement, filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, because the district attorney's office objected.
Heidnik and a now-defunct church he founded, the United Church of
the Ministers of God, are in bankruptcy.
   Assistant District Attorney Harriet Brumberg said Wednesday that
state law provides that 100 percent of such book or movie profits
goes to the victims. Peruto holds a $100,000 judgment note against
Heidnik's estate, guaranteeing his fee.

   Iranian and Iraqi soldiers fought in the
Kurdistan mountains Friday for control of a strategic area east of
the Kirkuk oil fields, which produce more than half the oil that
finances Iraq's war effort.
   At the United Nations, Francois Giuliani, spokesman for
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said Friday that a U.N.
team of experts will travel to Iran to see victims of what Tehran
claims was an Iraqi attack with chemical weapons.
   Each side claimed to have shot down four of the other's
warplanes during the battle on the northern front.
   Iran said its Revolutionary Guards killed or wounded 500 Iraqis
in heavy fighting east of Sayyid Sadiq. Both sides used warplanes
and helicopter gunships in the battle.
   In the Persian Gulf, Iraq claimed its warplanes scored
``accurate and effective hits'' on two tankers off Iran during the
night. There was no immediate confirmation from maritime executives.
   Reports from Tehran said the Iranians hit Basra, Iraq's southern
provincial capital, and five other border cities farther north with
missile and artillery barrages. Iraq said its warplanes bombed
Bakhtaran, Hamadan and Shushtar in western Iran.
   Iraq reported 10 civilians killed and 22 wounded. Iran said 53
people were killed in the Iraqi raids.
   Towns and cities on both sides of the frontier have been
battered regularly since the war began in September 1980.
   Both sides have fired more than 250 missiles into each others
capitals and other cities cities since Feb. 29, killing hundreds of
civilians.
   Foreign ministers of the Organization of Islamic Conference in
Amman, Jordan, said they would press the United Nations to force a
cease-fire on Iran. The Iranians left the meeting Thursday,
accusing the delegates of serving only Iraq's interest.
   In New York, Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati,
said Iraq used chemical weapons on Kurdish rebels, in violation of
international agreements. Giuliani said the U.N. delegation was
making the visit at Iran's request.
   Mahallati also said Tehran would send a special emissary for
peace talks at the United Nations. Perez de Cuellar had requested
the consultations on efforts to implement a cease-fire resolution
passed by the Security Council last year.
   Dispatches of Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said
Revolutionary Guards pushing into northeastern Iraq mauled four
infantry battalions and a brigade, totaling around 7,500 men.
   IRNA identified the brigade as part of Iraq's 7th Army Corps, an
element in the defense network that protects Basra from periodic
Iranian thrusts across the southern border.
   That indicated the Iraqis had moved forces from the south, where
about half their 1 million soldiers are concentrated, to counter
the northern offensive.
   According to the agency, fighting centered on the Rishan
mountains east of Sayyid Sadiq, the apparent Iranian objective in
the latest phase of the 10-day-old assault.
   An Iranian force of at least 30,000 men was said to be five
miles west of the town, an important transportation hub, on
Thursday after a two-pronged drive 10 miles across the border that
cut off many Iraqi soldiers.
   Tehran radio said four Iraqi fighter-bombers were shot down by
ground fire Friday and the pilots killed. Baghdad's official Iraqi
News Agency said anti-aircraft fire downed four Iranian jets in the
battle zone and Iraqi fighters destroyed four helicopters.
   Iran claims its soldiers have killed or wounded 11,000 Iraqis
during the northern offensive, captured 4,500 and destroyed 200
tanks and armored vehicles. Iraq says thousands of invaders have
been killed, but admits losing several towns.
   By Iranian accounts, Revolutionary Guards reached a position 5
miles east of Sayyid Sadiq after overrunning several other towns
since the offensive began March 16.
   They are said to control the area around the eastern shore of
Lake Darbandikhan and hills overlooking a major hydroelectric dam,
on the southern edge of the lake, that provides power for much of
northeast Iraq.
   Western military analysts said the Iranians could use the
captured territory as the base for a drive southward, behind Iraqi
defense lines in the central sector of the 730-mile border just 80
miles east of Baghdad.
   That could threaten the Kirkuk oilfields, 80 miles west of
Sayyid Sadiq. They are heavily defended and produce about 1.5
million barrels of crude a day, more than half Iraq's total
production.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Striking Teachers Rally To Demand Higher Wages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30,000 striking teachers
rallied in front of the federal government building Friday,
demanding higher wages to end a walkout that has idled 7.2 million
schoolchildren.
   The protesters are among 505,000 public school instructors who
remain off the job. Primary school teachers went on strike March
14, the first day of the Argentine school year, and were joined
Monday by secondary school teachers.
   No violence was reported during the giant rally in front of the
Government House, the seat of the federal government. Teachers
waved placards, taunted the government and listened to remarks by
union leaders.
   Teachers are seeking a minimum salary of $118 a month. The
government has countered with an offer of $84 a month, saying it
cannot afford more because of Argentina's economic crunch.
   The teachers' union, the Confederation of Educational Workers of
the Argentine Republic, is part of the four million-member General
Confederation of Labor, Argentina's largest and most influential
union.
   Argentina's foreign debt of $50 billion is among Latin America's
largest and payment of interest on the debt seriously drains its
reserves. Inflation in 1987 was 175 percent, more than twice the
rate of 1986.

   Despite promises of horse-diapers and
careful drivers, this luxury resort has said neigh to a
$100-an-hour horse-and-carriage service similar to those operated
in New York's Central Park.
   ``Horses are lovely animals. I think they're very beautiful _ in
someone else's town,'' Town Councilman Paul Ilyinsky said Thursday
after the Palm Beach Public Safety Committee turned down the
proposal.
   Ilyinsky said there would be accidents and ``a lot of mangled
horses'' if they were allowed to trot around town.
   Darcy Canevari, 24, who runs a horse-drawn carriage service in
Norwalk, Conn., had asked for a trial run.
   ``I think people would love it,'' she said. ``It's very
romantic.''
   If anyone objects to manure on the streets, Canevari said, the
animals will be fitted with diapers. She said, however, that in
some towns ``they like to have the manure on the streets to let
people know the horses are there.''

<TEXT>
   The armed forces that keep Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega in power went unpaid Friday and the broke and
beleaguered government ordered businesses closed by the general
strike to reopen.
   In a decree issued under a week-old state of emergency, the
civilian government that does Noriega's bidding said it would take
away the commercial licenses of any businesses ``offering goods and
services to the public'' if they remained closed.
   The decree specifically mentioned grocery stores, pharmacies,
transportation companies and gasoline stations.
   An estimated 90 percent of Panama's industry and businesses have
shut down in the strike, called to force Noriega's removal as the
head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces that includes the military
and police.
   The government's inability to pay the Defense Forces kindled
hopes in the opposition that loyalty for him will wane.
   Several members of the Defense Forces, including a secretary at
military headquarters, said army, navy, police and air force
personnel did not receive their semi-monthly paychecks as scheduled
Friday.
   ``We did not receive our wages and we were not told when we
would receive them,'' said the secretary, who declined to give her
name. Soldiers questioned by reporters also said they had not been
paid.
   In mid-March, most of the 130,000 public employees were given
partial payment of at least $75 on their salaries. Those employees
whose monthly salaries are $1,000 or more were not paid. Social
security checks have been postponed.
   Demonstrators at the Roman Catholic cathedral protested the
church's failure to issue a denunciation of Noriega as expected.
   Pilots who guide ships through the Panama Canal and claimed they
had been harassed by soldiers in Panama City demanded protection
and met with the Panama Canal Commission. Some pilots had spoken of
a strike, but commission spokesman Frank Castsrellon said the
situation was resolved at the meeting. He did not elaborate.
   John Maher, president of the Panama Canal Pilots Association,
said: ``There is no problem now.''
   Noriega remained obstinate.
   He was asked at a military ceremony about President Reagan's
renewed call for his departure and he replied:
   ``My president is called (Manuel) Solis Palma and my geographic
space is called Panama. I don't take orders from
extra-terrestrials.''
   Solis Palma was named chief executive by the legislature when
President Eric Arturo Delvalle was ousted on Feb. 26, the day after
he tried to fire Noriega.
   Two members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Reps. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y., and Peter H. Kostmayer, D-Pa., ended a two-day
visit Friday and told a news conference they thought the Reagan
administration should increase economic pressure on Noriega.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on narcotics
charges. The Reagan administration has cut the flow of money to
Panama, which uses the U.S. dollar as its currency.
   A threat to seize stores that refuse to open was in Decree No.
16 issued under the state of emergency that enables the government
to act as it deems necessary ``to secure public order,'' including
suspending civil liberties.
   It did not say how authorities would force businesses to open.
   Another decree issued Friday said any establishment that had
been closed for the past five days and sold food, meats or canned
goods ``cannot reopen unless it is first inspected by the Health
Ministry.''
   It said store owners who do not comply face ``temporary
suspension of their licenses or, in case of repeated violations,
the cancellation of their commercial licenses.''
   The strike began Monday and was called by the National Civic
Crusade, a broad alliance of Noriega's opposition. Crusade leaders
said it would continue until Noriega was ousted.
   Panama Canal employees have worked throughout protests and
general strikes against Noriega that began last June. The canal
continues to operate normally while the nation around the waterway
is at a virtual standstill.
   Most of the canal's 230 pilots are American citizens.
   Soldiers man roadblocks around the capital and they demand
identification from drivers, search cars and rummage through
personal belongings. Some pilots complained about those actions.
   About 100 people stalked out of the cathedral after Archbishop
Marcos G. McGrath opened a special Mass by telling worshipers and
observers the church would not issue the anticipated anti-Noriega
statement.
   ``We don't know how this mistaken rumor originated,'' McGrath
said. ``We are sorry, but it is not our fault.''
   Civic Crusade leaders and Ackerman had said they had been
assured the church would issue a strong condemnation of Noriega.
   Those who walked out stood on the steps of the gray stone
cathedral chanting, ``Justice! Justice!'' and ``Noriega must go!''
   McGrath told those remaining inside that he and Noriega had a
``preparatory meeting'' Thursday. He did not explain and said he
could not discuss the conversation.

<HEAD>Active Duty Rosters Down in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The active-duty strength of the nation's
military services declined in February from both the previous month
and the year-earlier period, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   As of Feb. 29, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force had
2,163,193 men and women on active duty, down 2,625 from Jan. 31 and
a decrease of 8,914 from the Feb. 28, 1987, tally.
   It is not unusual for military strength to swing up and down on
a monthly basis during the year, primarily because of differences
in the flow of new recruits.
   The strength totals are expected to vary even more widely than
normal this year, though, because the Pentagon is reducing its
active-duty strength in a budget-cutting move.
   According to the latest ``Military Strength'' assessment, three
of the four armed services reported personnel reductions in
February.
   The Marine Corps reported 198,231 men and women on active duty,
down just 12 from January. The Air Force had 603,599 on active
duty, down 975; and the Army listed 776,415, down 2,308.
   The Navy, meantime, reported an increase of 670 personnel in
February, with 584,948 on active duty at the end of the month.
   The Marine Corps and Air Force reported declines in strength
compared with Feb. 28, 1987, while the Navy and Army reported
slightly increases.

   The Soviet Union is lending nine rare works of
Islamic art for an exhibition of ancient Persian art and culture
planned next year at the Smithsonian Institution's Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, it was
announced Thursday.
   The art works from the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and the
State Armory at the Kremlin in Moscow have been seen rarely outside
the Soviet Union and never in the United States.
   The Soviet loan will include a pair of 14th century gold bowls
with dragon handles, two 15th century bronze oil lamps commissioned
by the Central Asian warlord Timur, also known as Tamerlane, and a
polychrome tile mosaic from Timur's monumental tomb in Samarkand.
   In exchange, the Sackler gallery and the Los Angeles museum will
lend master Islamic paintings, calligraphies and ceramic vessels to
be exhibited at the Hermitage for its 225th anniversary next year.
   The exchange was authorized by a protocol signed recently by the
Soviet Union, the Sackler and the Los Angeles museum under terms of
a cultural agreement reached at the 1985 Geneva summit meeting
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The American exhibition, ``Timur and the Princely Vision:
Persian Art and Culture in the 15th Century,'' will appear at the
Sackler from April 14, 1989, through July 9 and in Los Angeles from
Aug. 13 through Nov. 5.
   Initial support for the exhibition is being provided by the
National Endowment for the Humanities and the Smithsonian's special
exhibitions fund.

<HEAD>FCC Reaffirms Decision To Abolish Fairness Doctrine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday reaffirmed its decision to abolish its policy requiring
broadcasters to air conflicting views of controversial issues.
   The action will allow a lawsuit filed by supporters of the
fairness doctrine to go forward in the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia.
   The FCC voted 3-0 to deny reconsideration of its Aug. 4 decision
to scrap the doctrine on the grounds that it violated the First
Amendment and chilled broadcasters' coverage of controversial
issues of public importance.
   ``We anticipated this. We're happy the commission finally
acted'' so the court case can move along, said attorney Donna
Lambert, who with Henry Geller, a former FCC general counsel, are
asking the court to revive the doctrine.
   The case before the court stems from allegations by the Syracuse
Peace Council that Meredith Corp. station WTVH-TV in Syracyse,
N.Y., violated the fairness doctrine by broadcasting editorial
advertisements favoring construction of a local nuclear power plant
without presenting opposing views.
   The FCC's decision to abolish the doctrine infuriated Democrats
in Congress, who mustered the votes to pass legislation to
reinstate the policy but were unable to override President Reagan's
veto of the measure.
   These supporters say they will make another attempt to revive
the policy this year, against the wishes of broadcasters who oppose
the doctrine.

<TEXT>
   Two men were charged Friday with murdering five
supermarket employees during a robbery Sept. 4 in which the victims
were shot in the back of the head after being ordered to lie on the
floor.
   One suspect was arrested without incident Friday after a grand
jury handed up the indictments; the other remained at large, said
police Capt. Charles McCrary.
   Each was charged with five counts of murder, one of robbery and
two of assault in connection with two supermarket employees who
were wounded in the hold-up after closing time by gunmen posing as
a cleaning crew.
   Investigators have said they believe the two gunmen surprised
and shot to death a supermarket security guard. The four other
slain employees, including a 16-year-old bag boy, were shot while
lying on the floor.
   The gunmen robbed the cash register of several hundred dollars.
Most of the store's cash was kept in a safe that could be opened
only with the help of a Wells Fargo guard, police said.
   McCrary said the key to the arrests was the discovery of the
security guard's .38-caliber revolver in the trunk of a car
Brentwood police stopped for speeding.
   The police captain said the investigation continued another four
months because ``a lot of information needed to be checked into.''
   Donnie Blankenship of Overland had been jailed since November on
charges of receiving stolen property and unlawful use of the
guard's weapon, but posted bail in the last week or two and
remained at large, McCrary said.
   The other suspect, Marvin Jennings of Overland, was taken into
custody Friday, McCrary said.
   McCrary said more people may have been involved in the crime.
   ``I'm pleased we've got the indictments, but there's more work
to be done,'' he said. ``We're still at a critical point in this
investigation. There are still a lot of things we can't tell you.''
   Relatives of the victims expressed relief.
   ``It brings a little justice if they got the right people,''
said Sonja Spahn, the widow of the slain security guard,
27-year-old David Spahn.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon on Thursday expressed
reservations to a House panel's plan to kill funding for a Trident
nuclear submarine and instead build two destroyers that would give
Japan more security without disclosing secret U.S. technology.
   ``It really isn't the answer,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a
Defense Department spokesman.
   The House Armed Services seapower subcommittee voted this week
to delete the administration's request for $1.4 billion for a 16th
Trident submarine in the fiscal 1989 budget.
   Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla., subcommittee chairman and
architect of the funding maneuver, is wary of an administration
plan to sell sophisticated Aegis radar systems to Japan for new
Japanese destroyers.
   Instead, he wants the United States to build two extra Aegis
DDG-51 destroyers and station them in Japanese waters under U.S.
control, a move that would provide Japan with extra security while
not divulging technology.
   But Baumann said Bennett's plan would hinder U.S. efforts to
have Japan patrol its own waters. Under an agreement reached early
in the Reagan administration, Japan agreed to patrol waters out to
1,000 miles and U.S. forces would cover the rest of the Pacific.
   ``What we're trying to do is get Japan to do more, not to do
less,'' Baumann said. ``All of a sudden, we would be taking their
mission.''
   Bennett, however, said keeping a tight rein on technology
secrets should take precedent.
   ``I just don't want them to have our secret of our Aegis
ships,'' Bennett said in a telephone interview. ``It's not just
against Japan. We shouldn't unnecessarily share a secret with
anyone. ... It opens another channel of opportunity for spies.''
   The issue comes before the full Armed Services Committee next
week, and Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., plans to oppose the move,
said a congressional source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bennett said he did not know if the full committee would support
his plan. He said that if he loses, he will take his case to the
House floor, where he predicted he would prevail.
   Meanwhile, lawmakers from Connecticut and Rhode Island, where
Tridents are built by the Electric Boat Division of General
Dynamics Corp., vowed to fight the move.
   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., a former Navy secretary, wrote to
House Armed Service Committee members urging them to reject the
Bennett proposal.
   ``At a time when U.S. defense resources are so stretched, and
when increased burden-sharing by Japan has been endorsed by both
houses of Congress, it seems unwise to sacrifice a crucial Trident
submarine in favor of this new naval commitment of questionable
merit,'' Chafee said.
   The 18,750-ton Tridents each carry 24 long-range, multi-warhead
missiles. Trident contracts create thousands of jobs in southern
New England at Electric Boat's plants in Groton, Conn., and North
Kingstown, R.I.

<HEAD>Eastern Air Shuttle Case Moves to Appeals Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legal battle between Eastern Airlines and
its largest union over the carrier's proposed sale of its East
Coast air shuttle service moved to a higher court Thursday.
   Attorneys for Eastern filed papers with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, asking for dismissal of an
earlier ruling that the airline was in contempt.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt, who on March 10 found the
airline in contempt for attempting to sell the shuttle, on
Wednesday denied Eastern's request that he overturn his own ruling.
   The case pits the Miami-based carrier against the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents
12,000 mechanics and other ground workers at Eastern. The union and
the airline are in mediation seeking new contract terms.
   Eastern, whose parent company is Texas Air Corp., has proposed
selling its shuttle to another Texas Air subsidiary for $225
million. Company officials say Eastern needs cash, but union
leaders say the sale is simply an attempt to pare the union's
membership.
   The shuttle flies between Washington, New York and Boston and
earned a $17 million profit for Eastern last year. Overall, Eastern
lost $182 million in 1987.
   In another dispute, Pratt ordered Eastern last July to refrain
from taking any actions that would alter the machinists' working
conditions. On March 10, Pratt ruled that the proposed shuttle deal
violated that order.
   Eastern's lawyers also want dismissal of sanctions Pratt levied
against the airline on Monday. Pratt forbade Eastern to pursue
government permission to sell the shuttle, and threatened
$10,000-per-day fines for future transgressions.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He'd Consider Hispanic Runnning Mate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fielding questions in English and Spanish,
Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis on Thursday
denounced the U.S. role in Central America and said he would
consider a Hispanic running mate.
   Courting the Hispanic vote in the nation's largest
Spanish-language media market, the Massachusetts governor said he
favored a one-year extension in the deadline for illegal aliens to
apply for amnesty.
   Asked in Spanish if a Dukakis ticket would consider a Hispanic
as a vice-presidential running mate, he answered ``Tal vez
(perhaps),'' adding: ``Vamos a ver (We'll see).''
   Dukakis, who noted his own ethnic background as the son of Greek
immigrants, impressed some Spanish-speaking reporters with his
command of the language, although he spoke carefully and a
translation was sometimes requested.
   Invited to a question-and-answer session were reporters, editors
and executives of Los Angeles' Spanish-language media: three daily
newspapers, two television stations and at least five radio
stations.
   In blasting the Reagan administration's Central American
policies, Dukakis said Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias deserved
much of the credit for the recent cease-fire agreement between
Nicaragua's Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The Reagan administration's backing of the Contras and recent
dispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras did nothing to contribute to
the peace process, Dukakis declared.
   On the amnesty issue, Dukakis called for extending the May 4
deadline by which illegal aliens must apply for temporary resident
status another year.
   But regardless of whether Congress extends the deadline, Dukakis
said that as president he would ensure that the immigration
bureaucracy does not break up families in cases where only some
members qualify for amnesty.
   The U.S. Immigration Reform Act offers resident status to
illegal aliens who can prove they have lived continuously in the
United States for the last five years.
   It also sets stiff penalties for employers who knowingly hire
illegal aliens.
   Asked about the minimum wage, a perennial concern of minority
groups, Dukakis called for an increase.
   ``I don't see how you can support a family on $3.35 an hour,''
the candidate said.

<HEAD>Massive State Spending Reduces Unemployment, Fuels Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUDDY L. GONZALEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's
massive program of public works has created jobs but fueled
inflation in this Caribbean nation, a top presidential aide said.
   ``It's not that we don't want stability. That's a top goal of
the Balaguer government,'' Technical Minister Guillermo Caram said
in an interview before leaving with President Joaquin Balaguer on
Thursday for a meeting with President Reagan in Washington.
   ``But it has to be understood that we have to sacrifice now in
order to strengthen the base for tomorrow's growth,'' Caram said.
``For that, we have to make sacrifices today.''
   Balaguer was scheduled to meet with Reagan on Friday and then
with officials of international lending agencies. On Balaguer's
agenda was the U.S. sugar quota, which he wants increased, and the
Dominican Republic's $4 billion foreign debt.
   The government's $600 million program of construction of roads,
bridges, schools and hospitals has created 210,000 jobs within the
last year, Caram said. The money, to be spent through Balaguer's
four-year term, has spurred the country's economic growth rate to 9
percent, he added.
   But it also touched off double-digit inflation that private
economists say is closer to 40 percent than the official government
figure of 30 percent.
   The foreign exchange value of the peso, the Dominican currency,
has declined steadily since and now is worth less than 20 cents.
Just four years ago the peso traded evenly with the U.S. dollar.
   Increases in prices of gasoline, milk, rice and other basic
commodities earlier this month touched off strikes and skirmishes
between soldiers and stone-throwing youths. The clashes threatened
to escalate into full-scale riots such as occurred in April 1984,
when more than 100 people died.
   Balaguer fended off protestors by pledging to increase the
minimum wage by 30 percent to $75 a month, and to implement price
controls. Representatives from the government, labor, private
business and the influential Roman Catholic Church are to meet for
a second time in early April.
   Politically, the 80-year-old Balaguer seems to be in firm
control. He began a fifth presidential term in August 1986 after
being out of office for two consecutive terms.
   The opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party, split into camps
supporting former presidential candidate Jacobo Majluta and former
Santo Domingo Mayor Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, has not sought to
use the unrest to challenge Balaguer.
   Relief may come from Washington.
   Balaguer would like the United States to lift its sugar import
quota from the Dominican Republic from its current level of 160,000
tons annually. In 1983, the quota was 525,000 tons a year.
   In 1987, revenue from sugar sales was a record low $150 million.
   Balaguer also would like international lending agencies to ease
his country's debt repayment schedule, which last year totaled $700
million, or almost the entire value of Dominican exports.
   U.S. Ambassador Lowell Kilday traveled with the Balaguer
delegation, which includes Central Bank Governor Roberto Saladin.
   Before returning home, Balaguer, who suffers from glaucoma and
is nearly blind, was scheduled to visit a hospital in Boston for an
eye examination.

<HEAD>Bishops To Discuss AIDS Education at June Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops, at odds over what
role the church should play in AIDS education, will discuss the
issue at their June meeting in Minnesota, the president of the
national bishops conference said Thursday.
   Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis said the administrative
board of the U.S. Catholic Conference decided at its two-day
session, which ended Thursday, to schedule a discussion of ``the
pastoral, theological and moral dimensions of AIDS.''
   The board agreed that the discussion should ``be open-ended in
format with its direction determined by the will of the bishops,''
May said.
   He added that the discussion at the June 24-27 meeting in
Collegeville, Minn., would be held in executive session.
   The bishops conference's board recommended last December that
condom use be explained in church-sponsored AIDS education
programs, touching off a spate of criticism from conservative
bishops.
   Those bishops, led by cardinals Bernard Law of Boston and John
O'Connor of New York, said they would not allow condom use to be
explained or discussed in their dioceses' schools, hospitals and
youth programs. And they argued that abstinence is ``the only
morally acceptable way to avoid the sexual transmission of AIDS.''
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is spread through
close contact with blood or semen from infected persons.
   The conservative bishops were particularly concerned that the
bishops conference's 50-member board had made the condom
recommendation without a full vote of the conference's 380 members.
   In the wake of the criticism, May had suggested that the full
body of bishops discuss the issue at their meeting in Minnesota,
and the administrative board made that recommendation official.

<HEAD>FEC: Hart Can Use Some 1988 Funds to Pay Off 1984 Debt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gary Hart won permission Thursday to use
whatever is left of his skimpy 1988 campaign fund toward paying off
the $1.15 million debt from his 1984 presidential campaign.
   He cannot use any of the $1.12 million in federal matching funds
he received, however, leaving the prospect of only a projected
$100,000 or so in the kitty to transfer to the 1984 creditors once
the 1988 accounts are settled, his campaign said.
   Somewhat ironically, it was only Hart's exit from the 1988 race
this month that won him Federal Election Commission permission to
transfer the funds.
   Were he still a candidate, he would be excluded from using the
1988 money for anything other than 1988 campaign-related expenses,
the commission ruling said. He had submitted the request before he
quit the race on March 11, so the commission was in a position of
applying a different set of rules to the question.
   Once a campaign is concluded, the leftover money can be used for
any lawful purpose, election regulations state. That would include
paying some of the 1984 debts.
   But it is unclear how much money Hart will have left by the time
he pays winding down costs and the FEC conducts its lengthy audit
process. He must return to the federal Treasury anything left of
the federal matching funds that he received this year. Matching
funds accounted for about one-third of his total fund raising for
1988.
   Hart's campaign attorney, Bernie Schneider, said the campaign
was pleased with the FEC decision.
   He anticipated that after final 1988 bills are paid, the
campaign will have about $110,000 leftover to apply to the 1984
debt.
   Commissioner Lee Ann Elliott at Thursday's meeting raised doubts
that any any significant amount will remain.
   ``We're going to be talking about a small trickle of money as
against the '84 debt,'' she said.
   And the ruling Thursday does not end the saga of Hart's nearly
four-year-old debt, and Schneider said Hart will still work on
raising money to pay the rest.
   ``Nobody is running away,'' he said, but he could not specify
what kind of fund-raising efforts will be undertaken by the former
Colorado senator.
   Some creditors have taken Hart to court _ so far unsuccessfully
_ to try and place liens on the 1988 funds to recoup money they are
owed from 1984.
   One creditor got a court order that resulted in federal marshals
seizing $30,000 in proceeds at a Hollywood fund-raiser for Hart
last year.
   Two businesses filed suit in Denver. Tri-State Envelope Corp. of
Beltsville, Md., claims Hart owes it $133,600. Semper-Moser
Associates of Venice, Calif., an advertising agency, claims it is
owed $172,920.
   Hart's most recent campaign financial statement showed that at
the end of February he had $488,966 in cash on hand and $34,661 in
bills to pay.
   Schneider said the FEC audit staff will probably begin its audit
in the summer. The agency audits all presidential campaigns as a
routine once the campaign is concluded. The agency was still
finishing up 1984 audits last year.
   The FEC decision Thursday came in response to Hart's second
request on the same topic. He first asked if he could use 1988
funds toward the 1984 debt last spring. But after the commission
denied him federal matching funds on the basis that he was not an
active candidate, his campaign withdrew the request as moot.
   He withdrew from the race for the first time in May in the wake
of disclosures about his relationship with part-time Miami model
Donna Rice.
   When Hart re-entered the race last fall, he resubmitted the
request in hopes of wiping out the nagging 1984 debt.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has refused an
immediate ban on the spraying of herbicides on federal rangeland in
Oregon and Washington.
   In an order made public Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied an emergency injunction sought
by rural and environmental groups. The court said it would explain
its reasons later.
   However, no spraying is expected until at least late spring,
said Norma Grier, director of the Northwest Coalition Against
Pesticides, one of the groups filing suit.
   She said she hoped the court would rule before then on the
groups' appeal of a decision by a federal judge in Oregon who ruled
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management had adequately studied the
environmental effects of the weed-killer.
   The chemicals, including the controversial 2,4-D, are to be
sprayed on weeds that threaten forage or cause other harmful
effects on BLM land in the two states.
   U.S. District Judge James Burns blocked the spraying in 1984,
ruling that the BLM's environmental analysis had not considered the
range of possible danger to humans.
   The agency, supported in the case by a group of farmers and
ranchers, revised its analysis last year and concluded that under
the worst foreseeable circumstances, the herbicides were still
relatively safe.
   Burns in November lifted his injunction.
   At a hearing March 7 in Portland, Ore., opponents asked the
appellate court to reinstate the ban while it considers their
appeal of Burns' ruling.
   The appellate court's unanimous order Thursday did not address
the merits of Burns' ruling, which remains under appeal.
   John DiLorenzo, a lawyer for a group of farmers, ranchers and
herbicide users called Oregonians for Food and Shelter, said he was
encouraged by the court's decision. The group considers the
herbicides safe.
   But Ms. Grier said the government agency had ignored studies
showing health problems and had failed to consider non-chemical
approaches.
   The bureau ``should have looked at how to prevent problems
before they exist,'' she said. ``Are we managing our lands in a way
that encourages problem weeds? Could we alter the use of land by
livestock in a way that would make the land less susceptible to
noxious weed problems?''

   A record number of voters turned out Thursday
for an election late polls indicated would oust the incumbent
government of this British fortress colony.
   Clive Coon, the government press officer, said 13,325 _ or 76
percent _ of Gibraltar's 17,530 registered voters cast ballots. The
previous record, 74 percent, was set in 1984, the last election for
the 15-seat House of Assembly.
   Opinion polls among 29,000 citizens this week indicated victory
for Joe Bossano and his Gibraltar Socialist Labor Party over
incumbent Chief Minister Adolfo Canepa of the long-dominant
Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights.
   Coon attributed the high turnout to ``a lovely day.''
   An opinion poll published this week by the Gibraltar magazine
Panorama indicated 63 percent of voters favored Bossano, 26 percent
were for Canepa and 11 percent supported the Independent Democratic
Party of Joe Pitaluga.
   Canepa's party controlled the government for all but three years
since 1945 under the flamboyant leadership of Sir Joshua Hassan,
who retired last December at age 72.
   Bossano, 48, advocates self-determination and opposes Spain's
efforts to regain sovereignty over the 2.2 square miles of
limestone rock on its southern coast.

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell of Pennsylvania announced Thursday
that it is clarifying instructions to sales representatives and
mailing information to customers following charges of deceptive
sales practices.
   The announcement came after the state attorney general and
consumer advocate filed a suit and a complaint alleging the state's
biggest phone company stuck customers with such options as call
waiting, three-way calling and speed calling.
   While insisting the allegations were unjustified, Regis Filtz,
Bell vice president and chief operating officer, said the telephone
company was taking steps to resolve what he called confusion about
the options.
   ``We are going beyond what normally we would do to strengthen
and clarify and assure there is absolutely no misunderstanding in
terms of what customers order, what options they get, what the
value of those options is (and) what the prices are,'' Filtz said.
   ``We believe we go the extra mile to make sure that customers
are fully informed about their services, and have every opportunity
to change it whenever they wish.''
   State Consumer Advocate David Barasch said the company is ``at
least in part admitting the allegations we've been making.''
   But the state has not withdrawn the suit filed Monday in state
court or the complaint filed with the state Public Utility
Commission.
   The allegations made by Barasch and Attorney General LeRoy
Zimmerman were based on 32 test calls made to Bell representatives.
Of those calls, more than 70 percent were assigned one, two or
three optional services they had not requested or were not told
were optional.
   In one case, an agent posing as a single mother on welfare was
assigned service at $28.55 monthly, when basic service could have
been obtained for $6.65 per month, the officials said.
   Barasch alleged the representatives were subject to quotas or
``bonus'' plans geared to the optional services.
   Filtz said the workers did not receive commissions but can
qualify for prizes including toasters, appliances and pizza lunches
based on sales performance.
   In a complaint filed with the PUC, Barasch said Bell
representatives followed guidelines directing them to include
certain options, including a maintenance plan, when recommending
rates to new customers.
   The ``clarified'' guidelines do not include such instructions,
and also specify that customers be told the services such as call
forwarding and call waiting are optional.
   Bell of Pennsylvania has more than 3.7 million customers, or
about 80 percent of the state's telephone lines.
   The PUC complaint and the lawsuit seek fines, an end to the
allegedly deceptive sales practices, and customer refunds that
Barasch said could involve millions of dollars.

   Federal authorites raided espionage
suspects Thursday and made at least one arrest, the Bild daily
newspaper reported.
   ``Numerous offices and apartments were searched in connection
with the operation,'' it said, citing unidentified security experts.
   Bild said the raids may have been connected to the arrest of
Elke Falk last Friday as a spy suspect. She was working as a
secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation in Bonn.
Ms. Falk worked in the West German chancellory from 1974 to 1977
and in several ministries in later years.
   The brief Bild account, which was to appear in Friday editions,
gave no details. It was telexed to other news organizations in
advance late Thursday.
   Government officials could not be reached for comment
immediately.
   Ms. Falk is suspected of having worked as a spy for years,
according to the Federal Prosecutor's Office.
   She is being held in investigative custody and has not yet been
charged with any crimes, officials said.
   In the last major spy scandal to rock the government, 15
communist agents were arrested or disappeared between August and
December 1985.

<HEAD>Already Strapped City Faces Bankruptcy, Assets Frozen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family trying to force payment of
a $4 million jury award has obtained a freeze on the city's bank
accounts, apparently plunging this desperately poor community into
a payroll crisis.
   At least $85,000 in city checks were outstanding when the
accounts were frozen Wednesday, including about $37,000 in
paychecks issued March 15 but not yet cashed by municipal
employees, said city Treasurer Charlotte Moore.
   ``That kind of puts us in a destitute situation,'' said Alderman
Melvin Frierson. ``My real interest right now is payroll. That's
critical.''
   Mayor Carl Officer and city attorney Samuel F. Ross Jr. did not
return calls Thursday, but officials have said there was no way a
municipality with an annual budget of about $6 million could afford
to pay a $4 million.
   The money was awarded in 1985 to Walter DeBow, a Granite City
man who suffered permanent brain damage when he was beaten by a
fellow inmate in the East St. Louis jail.
   In November, the Illinois Supreme Court ordered the city of
55,000 people to pay the judgment, clearing the way for the DeBow
family to seize its bank accounts.
   On Wednesday, city accounts containing about $1.2 million were
frozen at four local banks.
   Clyde Kuehn, DeBow's attorney, said he did not think the city
would file for bankruptcy in federal court, a move that would put a
court-appointed trustee in control of municipal funds. ``They don't
want a trustee running the city,'' he said.
   ``As far as the people of East St. Louis are concerned, this
isn't going to hurt the citizens any more than they already are,''
he said. ``They already don't get their trash picked up. They
already have a fire department and police department that isn't
properly equipped.''
   William Stodghill, president of Local 50 of the Service
Employees International, said the 35 or 40 City Hall employees
represented by his union would meet Monday to discuss options that
could include a walkout.
   East St. Louis, once a thriving industrial city, became one of
the nation's poorest with the decline of the industries and the
exodus of whites in the 1960s.
   The city is 98 percent black, and 61 percent of its residents
receive some kind of assistance. Unemployment is unofficially
estimated at 40 percent.
   DeBow, who had been arrested for driving with an open bottle of
malt liquor, was placed in a cell with a man who was being held on
misdemeanor charges but had a history of violent crime.
   The man beat DeBow severely, causing permanent brain damage,
said Kuehn, adding his client would need constant medical care for
the rest of his life.

   A former nuclear technician who claimed he
revealed Israel's atomic secrets for the good of humanity was
convicted Thursday of espionage and treason and could be sentenced
to 20 years in prison.
   Mordechai Vanunu, 34, was found guilty by a three-judge panel
after a trial that had been closed to the public since it began in
September. His lawyer said Vanunu would appeal the verdict to
Israel's Supreme Court.
   ``Mordechai is very disappointed,'' said defense attorney
Avigdor Feldman. ``The court decided that he was a traitor, and he
had hoped to be seen differently. But he is not broken. He is
looking ahead to the appeal.''
   The conviction carries a maximum sentence of death. However,
prosecutor Uzi Chasson said he would ask the court for a sentence
of life imprisonment, which in Israel is limited to 20 years.
Sentencing is set for Sunday.
   Vanunu, who worked nine years at the nuclear facility in Dimona,
was charged for revealing details of Israel's atomic capacity to
The Sunday Times of London in October 1986.
   The newspaper said Vanunu's information showed Israel had
stockpiled the world's sixth-largest nuclear arsenal.
   Israel never has responded directly to allegations of its
nuclear capacity, saying only it would not be the first country to
introduce such weapons into the Middle East.
   Vanunu has insisted he made his revelations to alert the Middle
East and the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons. The state
argued he intended to harm Israel's security.
   He was kept under heavy security during the trial, which was
closed to the public because authorities feared an open hearing
would harm state security.
   Vanunu has been held in near isolation for the last 18 months
and has been permitted to see only his attorney and family.
   The precautions were taken after Vanunu managed to flash a
message to reporters at a pre-trial appearance by scribbling it on
the palm of his hand. In the message he said he had been kidnapped
in Rome, presumably by Israeli agents, and brought to Israel for
trial.
   Vanunu was fired from the Dimona nuclear center in 1985 and went
to Australia, where he became acquainted with a priest and
converted to Christianity.
   He later traveled to London, but disappeared in October 1986,
just days before The Sunday Times published his revelations.
Israeli officials acknowledged several weeks later he was in
custody in Israel.
   Details of Vanunu's journey back to Israel were revealed by his
brother, Meir Vanunu, who said Vanunu was lured from London to Rome
by an American woman named Cindy, who promised him sex. In Rome, he
was abducted by Israeli agents and spirited home, Meir said.
   During the trial, Feldman argued Vanunu did not hurt Israel's
security because information about Israel's nuclear capacity was
available in the academic world. He said Vanunu had in fact helped
state security because allegations of Israel's nuclear strength
served as a deterrent to Arab enemies.
   Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, said Thursday in London
that Vanunu was warned of the risks before divulging his
information. Neil said that Vanunu replied he was prepared to take
them because he wanted Israelis to know their country was a nuclear
power.
   ``But we will always regret that he did not take our warnings
seriously enough, with the tragic consequences of his abduction
which followed,'' said Neil.
   Neil said his paper was concerned about the way Vanunu was taken
from Britain and regretted he was convicted.
   ``We understand that democratic governments must protect secrets
in the national interest and that most Israeli citizens regard
Vanunu as a traitor,'' Neil said. ``But the citizens of every other
democratic nuclear power are not debarred from knowing that their
countries have nuclear weapons _ the nature of the defense of their
countries is one of their fundamental democratic rights.''

<HEAD>Stocks Tumble; Personal Income, Spending Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Stock prices tumbled Thursday even as the government reported
that Americans' personal incomes and consumer spending surged in
February.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
43.77 points to 2,023.87. Declining issues outnumbered advances by
more than 5 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange whose composite
index dropped 2.82 to 149.00.
   Analysts cited a continued decline in the dollar, which fell to
its lowest level in nearly two months against the Japanese yen and
West German mark, as contributing to the weakness in stocks.
   In its latest eonomic report, the Commerce Department said
personal incomes advanced 0.9 percent in February, reflecting
strong employment gains in the past few months. Spending rose 0.7
percent, up sharply from a tiny 0.1 percent January increase.
   Meanwhile, the government reported the savings and loan industry
last year recorded its worst annual loss since the Great Depression.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said a $3.2 billion loss in the
last three months of 1987 pushed the industry's red ink for the
year to a record $6.8 billion. That was nearly 50 percent greater
than the previous post-Depression record of a $4.6 billion, set in
1981.

<HEAD>Former GM President Estes Dead of Apparent Heart Attack</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elliott ``Pete'' Estes, who rose from junior
engineer to president of General Motors Corp. during a 42-year
career with the automaker, died of an apparent heart attack
Thursday. He was 72.
   Estes, a resident of Paradise Valley, Ariz., served as GM
president and chief operating officer from 1974 until his
retirement in 1981.
   Estes collapsed outside O'Hare International Airport of an
apparent heart attack, police said. He was pronounced dead on
arrival at Resurrection Hospital, according to hospital spokeswoman
Janice Youngwith.
   Estes, a native of Mendon, Mich., began his long-time
relationship with GM in 1934 when he enrolled at General Motors
Institute in Flint, Mich. He joined GM Research Laboratories as a
cooperative student while at the institute.
   Estes became a GM research engineer in 1939, a year before he
graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a degree in
mechanical engineering.
   In 1946, Estes joined the Oldsmobile Division in Lansing, Mich.,
as a motor engineer.
   In 1961 he was elected a GM vice president and general manager
of the Pontiac Motor Divison. He became general manager of the
Chevrolet Motor Division in 1965 and executive vice president for
GM operations staff in 1972.
   ``Pete Estes was one of GM'ss brightest stars. In whatever role
he assumed for the corporation, he performed at peak capacity,'' GM
chairman Roger B. Smith said in a statement.
   ``He demanded excellence from his subordinates, but he always
drove himself harder than anyone else. ... General Motors is a
stronger and better corporation because Pete Estes served it.''
   Survivors include his wife, Connie, and three sons.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Gives Hope for Captive Britons Waite, McCarthy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Hashemi Rafsanjani said Thursday that
Britain must help free Iranian hostages in Lebanon before Iran will
intervene on behalf of Anglican envoy Terry Waite and another
missing Briton, the BBC reported.
   A spokesman for Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said,
``If he (Rafsanjani) is confirming that John McCarthy and Terry
Waite are alive and being well treated by captors that is indeed
good news.''
   At a news conference in Tehran attended by British Broadcasting
Corp. correspondent John Simpson, Parliament Speaker Rafsanjani
said Britain must help free three missing Iranians kidnapped by
right-wing Christian Phalangists in summer 1982.
   Simpson interpreted his remarks as indicating Waite and British
reporter John McCarthy were alive. They are among 24 foreigners
missing in Lebanon. The BBC radio report, broadcast in London, made
no mention of non-British Western hostages. The longest held
hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   ``Rafsanjani said at first that he did not know if they were
alive or dead,'' Simpson said in a broadcast from the Iranian
capital. But when pressed, he began to talk of the conditions for
their release.
   Waite, Runcie's personal envoy, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after
leaving his west Beirut hotel to negotiate with an Islamic group in
his efforts to gain the release of Western hostages.
   No claim of responsibility has even been made in Waite's
disappearance.
   Simpson said, ``He (Rafsanjani) accepted that there was a clear
difference between on the one hand Mr. Waite, from a religious
background and Mr. McCarthy, a journalist and, on the other, a spy
or a military man.''
   When Simpson said that the Iranians were almost certainly dead,
Rafsanjani said someone should show Iran the bodies.
   The news conference took place during an Iraqi air strike in
which three missiles fell on the city.
   Rafsanjani showed no reaction during the bombing.
   McCarthy, a journalist for the London-based Worldwide Television
News agency, was kidnapped April 17, 1986.
   Two other Britons are being held, along with nine Americans and
other nationalities.

<HEAD>Media Surrender Film Of Irish Attack On Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republic's
broadcasting service said Thursday it gave British police video
segments of an angry funeral mob attacking two soldiers at an IRA
funeral.
   RTE turned over the videotape one day after Britain's two
television networks, the British Broadcasting Corp. and Independent
Television News, complied with similar demands for unbroadcast
footage from the funeral.
   Britain's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, denied British news
reports that the two soldiers were on an undercover mission when
they were hauled from their cars, beaten severely and then shot to
death.
   The three networks initially refused to hand over unbroadcast
film on the ground it would endanger crews covering future violence
in the British-ruled province.
   They complied after the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
provincial police force, threatened court action under British
anti-terrorist legislation.
   The two British corporals, Derek Wood, 24, and David Howes, 23,
were dragged from a car by a mob at an Irish Republican Army
funeral in Belfast on Saturday. They were beaten with iron bars and
then taken to a nearby soccer stadium, where IRA guerrillas shot
them to death.
   The crowd stopped TV crews filming when the soldiers were pulled
from the car.
   RTE said two detectives called at its offices in Belfast and
took away a 65-second videotape of the attack. The network said
most of the film was transmitted on the network.
   Security forces will examine the film to try to identify those
who took part.
   The Defense Ministry Thursday denied a report in the news, arts
and current affairs magazine The Spectator that Wood and Howes were
on an undercover mission in west Belfast when attacked. They were
in plainclothes in an unmarked car at the time.
   The Spectator, which supports the governing Conservative Party,
said: ``We shall never be told, though it seems to be the case,
that Cpls. Wood and Howes were on an undercover operation.'' It
gave no other details.
   Members of the Royal Corps of Signals are often employed on
surveillance work and other undercover activity. But a ministry
spokesman, who in accordance with British practice refused to be
identified, said the claim in The Spectator was ``inconceivable.''
   The army has said it thinks the soldiers may have become
involved with the cortege purely by accident while on their way to
their base at Lisburn barracks south of Belfast.

<HEAD>Austrian Parliament Approves Compensation To Nazi Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has passed a law that will
provide payments of up to $416 each to people victimized by the
Nazis when Austria was under German rule during World War II.
   The law, which had been planned for months, was passed Wednesday
by all three main political parties in Parliament. Five of the six
deputies from the small Greens Party voted against it, saying the
measure provided too little compensation.
   Under the law, those deemed to have suffered under Nazi rule
will receive one-time payments of from $208 to $416 at current
exchange rates. The payments vary depending on whether the
potential recipient was persecuted by the Nazis, forced to leave
the country or served in the resistance.
   No estimates have been published of how many people will be
eligible for payment.
   Alfred Dallinger, the Socialist welfare minister in the
coalition government, told Parliament he hoped the payments would
be understood as a symbolic gesture, since no sum could compensate
for such suffering.
   Adolf Hitler sent his troops to annex Austria to the Third Reich
in March 1938, a move many Austrians welcomed.
   Austria already pays small pensions to individuals persecuted by
the Nazis. Unlike West Germany, however, it never paid compensation
to Israel or any other state or group for Nazi crimes.
   The proposal was approved by the Socialist Party, the
Conservative People's Party and the rightist Freedom Party.
   Austria has been mired in a controversy over President Kurt
Waldheim's wartime past. Waldheim served as a lieutenant in a
German army unit in the occupied Balkans. His unit was linked to
war crimes, including the deportation of Jews to concentration
camps and the murders of partisans.
   Waldheim kept his military service in the area secret until 1986
and has denied wrongdoing since. A historians' commission said
Waldheim was in a position to know about Nazi war crimes and did
nothing to stop them.

   A judge has awarded the state permanent custody
of a 2-year-old whose mother accused of having used him as
collateral for $50 worth of cocaine.
   Lou Ann Powell, 26, did not appear at Wednesday's court session
during which Cook County Circuit Judge Claude Whitaker stripped her
of all parental rights to her son, Anthony.
   The boy has been in foster care since he was found outside a day
labor agency June 16.
   Ms. Powell told authorities when she identified the child in
October that she had a cocaine habit, was behind in payments to a
drug dealer and had offered the boy as collateral.
   ``She apparently planned to redeem him when she got some money,
kind of like when you take a promissory note from the bank,'' Frank
Giunta, a police youth division investigator, said at the time.
   Ms. Powell was charged with felony abandonment, said Lisa
Howard, spokeswoman for the state's attorney office.
   ``Anthony's foster parents already have moved to adopt him, and
we hope that becomes final soon,'' said Dave Schneidman, spokesman
for the state Department of Children and Family Services.
   Ms. Powell is also charged with neglect stemming from her
treatment of her younger son, Joseph, 13 months old. Ms. Howard
said authorities will seek to have her parental rights to Joseph
terminated in that case.

<TEXT>
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode on Thursday proposed a
$1.93 billion budget that would turn trash collection over to a
contractor, freeze wages and raise taxes for the first time since
he took office in 1984.
   The mayor of the nation's fifth-largest city, in asking for a
$67 million tax increase, left it up to City Council to decide
which taxes to raise.
   The increase will help ``meet human needs, create jobs, promote
economic development, care for and nurture our children and
revitalize our neighborhoods,'' said Goode, a Democrat elected in
November to a second term.
   His budget for fiscal 1989, which starts July 1, represents a
6.4 percent increase over the current budget of $1.86 billion.
   Goode proposed cutting $50 million in costs through new labor
contracts or new contract terms and by turning over garbage
collection to private industry, a move that could eliminate several
thousand jobs and save $35 million annually.
   Garbage collection in Philadelphia has come under attack as
sloppy and rife with overtime abuse.
   ``I am a lifelong supporter of organized labor and while part of
my financial plan anticipates privatization, which they may find
difficult, I am resolute in pursuing this only to the extent that
labor fails to work with the city to find meaningful and cost
effective alternatives,'' Goode said.
   The mayor's budget offers no wage increase to the city's
blue-and white-collar employees, whose contracts expire this
summer. The spending plan does not include the school system, which
has proposed a $1 billion budget.
   It would add $44.3 million to basic services, which include
police and fire protection, street cleaning, job training, housing
rehabilitation and programs for children, the homeless and AIDS
victims, who would receive $7.5 million.
   Tax revenue for the current fiscal year is projected at $1.4
billion. The mayor's spending plan for the coming year projects tax
revenue of $1.5 billion.
   ``Everybody's inclination is against a tax increase,'' said
Councilman David Cohen, a Democrat.
   Republican Councilman Thacher Longstreth said he considered
raising taxes ``a disgrace'' but also said it probably would be
done.
   Council President Joseph Coleman, a Democrat, said: ``We are
going to have to raise taxes or cut the budget tremendously.''

   A pilot testified Thursday that he
took his 4-year-old son with him as cover while flying cocaine into
the United States for alleged drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   ``I believe he was the youngest drug smuggler at that time,''
said Andrew Richard Barnes, 32.
   Lehder, 38, is on trial on charges of smuggling about 3.3 tons
of cocaine into the country from Colombia via Norman's Cay in the
Bahamas from 1978 to 1980.
   Barnes, a native of England known as British Andy, said he
transported 3,000 kilograms, or about 6,600 pounds, for Lehder
while working for him in 1978 and again in 1980.
   Barnes told the jury that he would receive a telephone call the
night before each trip from one of Lehder's employees.
   ``Come over and pick up the children and take them to school,''
was the message he said he received. ``Children'' was Lehder's term
for cocaine, witnesses have testified.
   In October 1980, Barnes said, he transported two loads of 450 to
500 kilos each from Norman's Cay, which was Lehder's private
island, into Fort Lauderdale International Airport.
   ``He (Lehder) said it was the largest loads we'd done,'' Barnes
said, adding he was paid $225,000 for the flights.
   Three other flights were made in the latter part of 1980, and
Barnes said he took his son with him to appear that they were on a
family outing.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged with taking part in a smuggling conspiracy.

   Jazz trumpeter Al Hirt was admitted to a hospital
Thursday for treatment of an infection in his playing hand.
   The 65-year-old Bourbon Street musician flew from his home in
New Orleans to be under the care of his friend, famed heart surgeon
Michael DeBakey, at Methodist Hospital.
   ``I had this infection or something in my hand. It's like blood
poisoning. It looks like it's from a bite or something. It's all
swollen and has red streaks,'' Hirt said.
   ``But my prognosis is excellent. I'm going to be OK as long as I
can keep blowing the trumpet.''
   Hirt said doctors think the problem may be a related to his
trumpet playing and a growth that developed on a finger of his
right hand after 59 years of horn work.
   He was expected to remain hospitalized for at least several
days, DeBakey said. Hirt had been scheduled to perform at a benefit
Thursday for the financially troubled New Orleans Symphony.
   ``The prognosis is excellent for Mr. Hirt,'' DeBakey said. ``I
am sorry he will miss his performance, but his health is most
imporant at this point.''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is raising
the possibility that the administration will seek legislative
authority for a quick vote on military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels
if the cease-fire there breaks down.
   Shultz said Thursday night that the prospect of additional
military assistance to the rebels would be added insurance that
Nicaragua's leftist government will abide by promises it makes
under its cease-fire agreement with the Contra rebels.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., indicated that he would
oppose any effort by the administration to have an ``expedited
procedures'' provision for military aid included in a Contra
humanitarian assistance package the Congress will take up next week.

   Recent polls and his own need to come up
with a victory in the North have forced Democrat Albert Gore Jr. to
back off from his claims that rival Michael Dukakis can't win in
November.
   In the glow of his Southern victories two weeks ago, Gore was
depicting Dukakis as having the electoral appeal of George McGovern
and Walter Mondale.
   Campaigning in the North now, Gore has halted the harsh
rhetoric. And with recent polls showing Dukakis _ not Gore _ as the
only Democrat running even nationwide with GOP front-runner George
Bush, Gore is having a more difficult time pinning his rival with
the image of the Democrats' landslide losers of 1972 and 1984.

   Gephardt dismissed questions Thursday about aides' comments that

   But before a crowd of laid-off auto workers, enthusiastic about
his call for tough foreign trade policies, Gephardt acknowledged
his presidential candidacy is in need of extraordinary help from

Sanders came down to earth to a place in the record books and the
fiance she has never dated.
   ``Everything looks so small, so different from here,'' Miss
Sanders, 19, said Thursday after a fire truck's bucket brought her

   There will be no organized union boost behind
a single candidate in Saturday's Democratic caucuses in Michigan, a
state where union members can wield more clout than almost anywhere
else.
   While national labor leaders are assuming Michael Dukakis will
be the eventual nominee, they are prevented from endorsing him by
what appears to be growing rank-and-file support for Jesse Jackson,
who has gotten more union votes than any of the other candidates in
primaries so far. Richard Gephardt also has considerable union
support.
   None of the Democratic candidates appears to have won the hearts
_ or votes _ of a majority of the state's 750,000 rank-and-file
union workers, nearly half of them members of the United Auto
Workers.

   The leftist Sandinista government and
the Contra rebels each claimed on Friday that its own military
pressure helped force the other to yield to a cease-fire plan.
   The Sandinistas, in their newspaper Barricada, called on
citizens to prepare for ideological warfare to defend the ruling
party against the Contras. The Contras hinted that if peaceful
measures don't bring about democratic reforms, they are prepared
take up arms again.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman said there were no reports of
combat on Friday, five days after the two sides agreed to suspend
offensive operations.

   Conservative Republican members of Congress are
wary of the cease-fire pact in Nicaragua _ one calls it a
``disguised surrender'' _ and say the United States will have to
continue pressuring the Sandinistas until they install a truly
democratic system.
   At the same time, the congressmen _ attending a GOP retreat here
_ say it was American pressure and American aid to the Contras that
forced the Sandinistas to deal with the Contras.
   The result was this week's dramatic turn of events: a 60-day
cease-fire agreement signed by representatives of the Nicaraguan
government and the guerrilla leaders, and a Sandinista promise to
institute democratic reforms.

<HEAD>Oscar Countdown: Magic Moments</HEAD>
<HEAD>Streakers, Littlefeather and Tears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the 60th Academy Awards are presented on
April 11, the evening is likely to produce at least one magical
moment that will last in the memories of those who watch
Hollywood's annual salute to itself.
   That has happened throughout Oscar's fabled history: one
unscripted, unexpected and spontaneous moment that electrified the
audience. Rarely have the awards failed to produce such an event.
   Everyone has his or her own favorite, and here are just a few:
   _ Sacheen Littlefeather. In 1973, there was speculation that
Marlon Brando, nominated as best actor for ``The Godfather,'' might
pull a surprise. He did.
   When Roger Moore announced that Brando had won, a woman in a
Native American costume came onstage and brushed away Roger Moore
as he tried to hand her the Oscar statuette. She said her name was
Sacheen Littlefeather, that she was Apache and president of the
National Native American Affirmative Image Committee.
   ``Marlon Brando ... very regretfully cannot accept this very
generous award. And the reasons for this being are the treatment of
American Indians today by the film industry.'' The audience was
stunned as she left the stage.
   _ The Naked Stranger. In 1974, David Niven's introduction of
Elizabeth Taylor was suddenly interrupted by screams and laughter
from the audience. Niven turned around just as a naked man flashing
a peace sign raced past him. Streaking was the year's fad on
college campuses and elsewhere.
   Henry Mancini had the orchestra play ``Sunny Side Up,'' and the
imperturbable Niven commented: ``Just think, the only laugh that
man will probably ever get is for stripping and showing off his
shortcomings.''
   Miss Taylor came on stage and said, ``That's a pretty tough act
to follow.''
   _ The Tramp's Farewell. In 1972, the Academy voted Charlie
Chaplin a special award. The event was packed with drama because it
was Chaplin's first return to Hollywood since his self-exile 20
years before. The furor over his politics was forgotten. More
important was the ``incalculable effect he has had in making motion
pictures the art form of the century.''
   When Chaplin appeared onstage at the end of the ceremonies, the
ovation was thunderous. Frail and overwhelmed, he did a little
flipping trick with the black derby that was his trademark.
   _ Last of the Duke. In 1979, John Wayne was scheduled to appear
at the awards despite his desperate fight with lung cancer. A
trailer was parked outside the Los Angeles Music Center so he could
rest before his entrance.
   ``Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. John Wayne,'' announced Johnny
Carson. When the cheers finally subsided, the Duke cracked,
``That's just about the only medicine a fella'd ever need.'' Within
three months he was dead.
   _ A Sign of Thanks. Last year, Marlee Matlin was the favorite
for best actress because of her role as the deaf woman in
``Children of a Lesser God.'' When her name was announced, the
Music Center audience roared its approval.
   Miss Matlin's graceful hands described her gratitude, and her
remarks were swiftly spoken by her interpreter. Her performance
reminded many of Louise Fletcher's acceptance of her 1976 best
actress award for ``One Flew Over the Cuckko's Nest.'' As she spoke
her words, she used sign language for her parents, who were both
deaf.
   _ Patton Says No. George C. Scott had once requested that his
name be withdrawn as candidate for supporting actor in 1961 for
``The Hustler'' (the Academy declined). So everyone wondered if he
would accept the Oscar if he won for ``Patton'' in 1971.
   He won, and he wouldn't accept. Frank McCarthy, the producer of
``Patton,'' accepted Scott's award, but it was never delivered.
Scott's opionion of the awards: ``A two-hour meat parade.''
   _ Miss Bergman Returns. In 1957, Ingrid Bergman was nominated as
best actress for ``Anastasia.'' Would Hollywood forgive her
desertion and disgrace when she mothered a child by Roberto
Rossellini before they were married? It would.
   Her victory was a dramatic moment, even though she wasn't at the
awards to enjoy it. Cary Grant accepted for her and remarked:
``Dear Ingrid, if you can hear me or see this, I want you to know
that we all send you our love and admiration.''
   _ ``Aw, Coop.'' Gary Cooper, who had won two Oscars during his
career, was given an honorary Oscar in 1961 but he was not at the
ceremonies. His close friend, James Stewart, accepted the award for
him.
   Stewart began crying during his speech and could only say, ``Aw,
Coop,'' before walking tearfully off stage. The world realized the
desperate health of Cooper, who was too ill to attend. He died of
cancer a month later.
   _ Kate Shows Up. The all-time acting winner with four Oscars,
Katharine Hepburn never appeared to collect her awards. Finally, in
1974 she came to the ceremonies to present the Thalberg award to
her longtime, ailing producer, Laurence Weingarten.
   ``I'm the living proof someone can wait 41 years to be
unselfish,'' said the indomitable Hepburn.
   _ Elizabeth Redux. Elizabeth Taylor had been reported near death
from pneumonia in 1961 when she was nominated for best actress in
``Butterfield 8.'' Miss Taylor herself had termed it ``the most
pornographic script I have ever read,'' but she played the New York
call girl so she could escape her MGM contract and star in
``Cleopatra.''
   ``I don't believe it!'' she exclaimed when Yul Brynner announced
her the winner. She told the audience, ``Thank you with all my
heart,'' then went backstage and fainted.

<HEAD>Economy After the Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   October's stock market crash had little impact
on the economy, according to some university economists who base
their judgment largely on numerical measurements.
   But there has been an impact, a very clear-cut one that can be
detected without any instruments, including calculators.
   It can be seen in a strange bullishness in the stock market
itself. It can be observed in the tendency of professional analysts
to discount the good news about the economy that shows up in the
statistical indicators.
   The impact, though not the expected one, shows in a strange
propensity of investors to write off the collapse as an aberration
_ to diminish its significance, for example, by calling it a
``change of leadership.''
   Since the crash, some analysts point out, smaller stocks that
had been ignored during the bull market have surged, along with
rising volume. Some have risen 50 percent, re-igniting the hopes of
many for a quick killing.
   The scent of potential profits is as strong and enticing as
freshly brewed coffee. It spreads, and even those folks who lost
the family jewels just a few months ago are enjoying the prospect
of buying them back.
   Corporations have similar thoughts. Through March 7, a total of
15 deals of $1 billion or more were announced during 1988, or
nearly half the total for all 1987, and some have been at
unrealistically high prices.
   While a notion seems to prevail that the stock market cannot be
stopped from going higher, the exact opposite attitude is expressed
about the U.S. economy. Good economic reports are immediately
discounted by analysts.
   If you had listened to the latter, the fourth quarter of 1987
was a time of economic downturn. But when the figures came in they
showed the economy grew at 4.3 percent, later revised to 4.5
percent and this week to 4.8 percent.
   Economists expressed concern that consumers would drastically
lower their spending because of (1) fears generated by the stock
market collapse, and (2) their inability to continue taking on
additional credit. It didn't happen.
   An accumulation of inventories _ of goods already made and still
to be sold _ was expected to slow production during the early part
of the year. But latest reports suggest the inventory problem isn't
as big as had been feared.
   Inflation was supposed to have menaced the economy by now, but
instead it has acted like a groundhog that believes there'll be no
summer. The February consumer price index rose at a 0.2 percent
rate, a barely measureable amount.
   Deep-rooted doubts continue to exist among economists regarding
the renewed health of manufacturing, although output by that sector
accounted for 22 percent of gross natinal product last year, one of
the highest percentages in 40 years.
   Concern prevails about the recovery of exports, the
competitiveness of American goods, the level of interest rates, the
budget deficits and more. But in most instances, the news about
these matters has been good.
   It's may be a puzzle for psychologists rather than economists.
   The stock market crash seems to have intensified existing fears
about the economy, but not about the market itself.
   In fact, the temporarily depressed prices of stocks may have
drawn in a brand-new set of speculators, just as the relatively
healthy economy has produced more doubters.

<HEAD>`Frontline' Offers Candid Look at Soviets Under Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lisa, a first-grader and the daughter of
underground artists in the Soviet Union, says she's afraid of what
she will be asked at school the next day.
   The questions won't be about her lessons, but about the people
who had visited her parents.
   When asked what she will reply, she tells the visitors, who are
documentary filmmakers, that she will not tell her teachers that
Americans were at her house, only ``daddy's friends.'' She shows
them her stuffed cat and tells them the cat knows she shouldn't
tell ``family secrets'' at school.
   The documentary ``Back in the U.S.S.R.,'' airing Tuesday on PBS'
``Frontline,'' illustrates the pervasive fears of Soviet citizens
and the double lives some of them lead despite the economic and
social reforms the Kremlin has launched.
   The hour-long show looks at how the lives of the Soviets have
changed in the last 20 years through the eyes of an American
journalist and his family who lived in Moscow in the 1960s and
returned last year for three months.
   Jerrold Schecter, the former Moscow correspondent for Time
magazine, and his wife and grown children looked up old friends,
artists, Jewish refuseniks, writers, political dissidents and
others, and talked to them about Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, known
as ``perestroika.''
   The people they spoke with are the intelligentsia: those who
have been Gorbachev's staunchest supporters and thus the ones with
the most to lose if his experiment fails.
   Americans have been able to see many documentaries in recent
years on the other superpower, including Ted Turner's current
seven-hour ``Portrait of the Soviet Union,'' depicting the U.S.S.R.
in glowing, flattering terms.
   How the ``Frontline'' documentary differs from the others is
that its producers managed to conduct many interviews on camera
without the presence of officials from Gostelradio, the state
broadcasting committee, who have always accompanied Western
filmmakers in the Soviet Union.
   ``We negotiated a deal with them,'' says ``Frontline'' producer
Sherry Jones. ``It was unusual at the very least. If their presence
would likely interfere with the conversation, I had the right to
ask that he not be there.''
   Thus, the camera crew was able to elicit thoughtful, candid
answers in their interviews from subjects who otherwise might be
intimidated by the presence of a member of Gostelradio.
   Because members of the Schecter family speak Russian and know
the country well, there's no need for state-supplied interpreters
or guides who might stage events for the camera.
   In another candid scene, also shot without government
intervention, a middle-aged couple strolls in a park with the
Schecters in the rain under umbrellas. The couple, who lived
through the era of Nikita Khrushchev and saw his reforms blossom
and fail, said they no longer want to stay in the Soviet Union,
describing it as a land of ``lies and double-thinking.''
   ``All thoughtful people hope perestroika won't stop,'' the woman
says. ``They are afraid. People our age lived through the
disappointment of Khrushchev's times. That was a time of bitter
disappointment.''
   The crew also interviewed Jewish refuseniks who tell the painful
tale of how their daughter has been allowed to emigrate while they
have not, and of the anti-Semitism they have encountered.
   A dissident historian who spent time in a labor camp gives his
wry views of Soviet leaders since Stalin.
   Even when the subjects were part of the establishment, the
``Frontline'' crew seemed to get frank comments.
   At the state-controlled newspaper Izvestia, Jones said officials
initially tried to persuade her to photograph a formal editorial
meeting. But she begged off, saying she didn't have enough lights.
   She opted instead for an informal daily afternoon bull session
by a few editors over coffee in the cafeteria. There, the editors
got into a lively debate on Soviet residency permits, which
restrict where people live.
   An Izvestia editor shows off the stacks of mail the newspaper
receives and tells of the letter he will print that day. It is from
a reader who is afraid to embrace Gorbachev's reforms because the
government cannot guarantee that one day, if the policies are
reversed, those who speak out now won't be attacked as
``anti-Leninist.''
   One answer is provided by Oleg Yefremov, an avant-garde theater
director who is said to have been given a personal assurance of
support by Gorbachev.
   ``Everybody is afraid of one thing: that it will all get covered
up again,'' Yefremov says. The intelligentsia must ``push this
thing farther and farther open. Then it will be impossible to cover
it up again.''

<HEAD>Moyers Program on Evil Inevitably Discusses Good</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The title of ``Facing Evil, with Bill Moyers''
evokes images of 90 minutes in front of the television in a dark
depression contemplating the worst in human nature.
   Not so. As Moyers says in his introduction to this surprisingly
uplifting report, a discussion of the dark mystery of evil seems
inevitably to lead to a celebration of the light.
   Part of Moyers' ``news of the mind'' series for PBS, the former
network journalist taped the special at a symposium called
``Understanding Evil,'' sponsored by the University of Texas and
featuring a distinguished group of speakers, including poet Maya
Angelou, Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg, choreographer and author
Chung-Liang Al Huang, author Philip Paul Hallie, and Dr. Samuel D.
Proctor, a Baptist preacher.
   Often as eloquent as the featured speakers are the audience
members, ranging from a Holocaust survivor still struggling to
understand what happened to her, to a Vietnam veteran who says his
experience ``has made me think of evil in another way, coming out
of Vietnam, turning around and seeing it wearing my own face.''
   The message from the program _ and it's never forced _ is that
good and evil reside in the human spirit, and it takes an act of
will to repress evil in favor of good.
   Angelou, a striking television presence, tells of being raped
when she was 7. The man who attacked her was known to her family.
Soon after he was released from jail, he was found dead, apparently
kicked to death. The child believed she had brought on the man's
death by speaking his name. She didn't speak again for five years.
   A horrible thing to happen to a child. But, she said, during
those five years, she sought solace in reading, everything she
could get her hands on, memorizing poems, stories and plays. When
she finally spoke again, she had truly found her voice, thanks to
words and wisdom of others.
   Hallie still grapples with the concept of evil after a lifetime
of study. A soldier in World War II, he says he is horrified to
recall enjoying the violence of conflict. He was so moved by the
story of courageous, peace-loving French villagers who disarmed the
German invaders with love, he wrote a book about them and found
himself transformed. But later, he realized, it was not the
villagers who defeated Hitler, but those like himself who killed
the Germans.
   Hallie likens the struggle between good and evil to the
experience of being in a hurricane _ all around is fury, but there
can still be blue sky above. To a quotation from George Santayana,
``In the midst of battle there is room for love,'' Hallie adds his
own thought _ ``We can push back and expand the blue, but we're in
the eye of the hurricane, and don't ever forget it.''
   Hilberg is more pessimistic, having studied the Holocaust and
realized that it took thousands of typical _ and well-educated _
citizens to produce it. His presentation prompts audience members
to wonder whether they could be caught up in evil mob psychology,
be it Nazism or a lynching, if they had been there.
   It's a compelling 90 minutes, thanks to Moyers' insistence on
presenting ideas, not neat conclusions. Stylistically Moyers
ignores the accepted television tenet that talking heads are
boring. He believes in the power of storytelling and pushes the
camera up close, but avoids visual monotony by interspersing
footage of the speakers at the podium with often emotional
one-on-one interviews. He also artfully refers with the camera
occasionally to the incongruously serene central Texas landscape.
   Moyers, who has only been seen in a brief introduction, returns
at the end of the program to offer, not a conclusion but a question
_ if we can identify an evil act after it occurs, why can't we stop
it before it happens?
   ``That we usually fail to see an act in time,'' he says, ``is as
puzzling to me as the persistence of evil itself.''

   Soap opera mogul Bill Bell had a producer on
the phone, was doing running commentary on the action on two TV
monitors, and was adroitly fielding questions on the 15th
anniversary of ``The Young and the Restless.''
   Bell looked deceptively calm in the eye of the storm, but it was
Bell generating the hurricane whirling about his penthouse office
atop CBS' Television City.
   He is the executive producer, head writer and co-creator, with
his wife, Lee Phillip Bell, of ``The Young and the Restless'' and
``The Bold and the Beautiful.''
   At 15, ``Y&R,'' as he usually calls it, is running neck and neck
in the Nielsen ratings with ABC's ``General Hospital'' as the most
popular daytime show. ``The Bold and the Beautiful,'' which just
passed its first anniversary, was in ninth place in the ratings.
   ``I think we brought a new approach to daytime programming
because we featured young people,'' Bell said of ``Y&R.'' ``It's a
very contemporary show and we make good use of music and closeups
in ways that hadn't been used before. Our stories are provocative.
I won't say sensual because that would give the wrong impression,
but sometimes they are.''
   Bell said he is in good shape to weather the strike of the
Writers Guild of America, provided it's settled soon. He has
scripts for six weeks of ``The Young and the Restless'' and five
weeks of ``The Bold and the Beautiful.'' In addition, he has
several weeks of shows already taped. They are taped far in advance
to get them overseas.
   As he talked to his visitor, Bell relayed instructions to
producers on the sets and commented on the taping and the actors on
the screen.
   Bell watched a young actor on the monitor for ``The Bold and the
Beautiful.'' The actor was Ethan Wayne, the son of late film legend
John Wayne. ``Can you think of a better place for a young actor to
train?'' Bell asked. ``They get new material every day, filled with
conflicts and romance, and they get stretched every way possible.''
   Later, daughter Lauralee Bell came on the screen. She plays
Cricket on ``Y&R.'' One son, Bradley, is a script writer, and
another, Bill, runs business affairs for ``The Bold and the
Beautiful.''
   Bell, a former Chicago advertising executive and writer for
other daytime serials, was lured away from his job as head writer
of NBC's ``Days of Our Lives'' to create a new show for CBS.
   ``Fred Silverman was the head of CBS programming then and he
paid me more to quit `Days of Our Lives' than I was getting paid to
do it,'' he said.
   ``Lee had her own show in Chicago and I went back to Chicago.
There we were staring at a blank sheet of paper. We did 70 pages,
which took the story through the first two years.''
   Soap operas are difficult to establish because viewers are
reluctant to break their viewing habits. Bell had hoped that ``The
Young and the Restless'' would make a breakthrough, but when the
ratings failed to climb he grew impatient and asked CBS to take it
off the air.
   ``It wasn't doing as well as I thought it should,'' he said.
``But Fred Silverman showed me ratings figures that convinced me to
stay with it. It took the show a year and a half to get established.
   ``When you have a long-running show the audience grows older
with the show,'' said Bell. ```The Young and the Restless' was the
first show to turn that around and attract a young audience for
CBS.''
   In 1980 Bell did something that was unprecedented in daytime
television.
   The show had begun with the focus on two families, the Fosters
and the Brooks. Several young actors decided to leave the show and
it began to affect the two families.
   ``After one young actress told me she was leaving I knew it
would be a mortal blow to try to replace her,'' he said. ``I'd
already had to replace several other actors. What I did was
gradually move the focus from the Fosters and the Brooks and
brought in two new families, the Abbotts and the Williamses.
   ``It was a fascinating thing, but we were also scared. We didn't
know if it would work. But the audience stayed with us and the show
has grown in the ratings.''

   NEW GAME SHOW _ ``Family Double-Dare'' will join the Fox
Broadcasting Co. on Saturday, April 9, as a prime-time version of
the popular ``Double-Dare'' children's show on Nickelodeon. The new
show will use two children and their parents as contestants
competing for prizes. The winners go on to compete in an obstacle
course appropriately called ``the messiest minute on television.''
Marc Summers is the host of the show.

   It is a puzzle to conventional economists, a
challenge to management and marketing people and, according to its
discoverer, ``political dynamite'' for presidential contenders.
   It is the split personality of the American economy.
   The United States has two economies, says Albert Sindlinger.
There is what he calls the Coastal Economy, which has been sluggish
of late. And there is the Heartland Economy, which has become more
vigorous over the past two years.
   When compiling national figures, one tends to offset the other.
When the Coastal Economy boomed, the Heartland Economy was in
recession. Now the latter is thriving, at least relative to 1985,
while the other one lags.
   The Heartland is based on manufacturing, agriculture, mining and
forestry. It suffered badly between Memorial Day 1985 through
February 1987. Sindlinger referred to 31 states as being in
recession then. Only four now are.
   The Coastal Economy is sited mostly on the Eastern and Western
seaboards. Much of its strength depends on the service sector,
including, of course, the various financial industries. It lost
spunk following the stock market crash.
   In the Coastal Economy, which incidentally has gaps in its
uniformity _ in Massachusetts, for example, there has been a
continued boom _ they worry about the billions of dollars that
vanished in the stock crash.
   In the Heartland, says Sindlinger, ``the decline in services and
the crash have been only events on the evening news, as remote as
news dispatches on the fighting in Afghanistan.''
   How does Sindlinger know all this? Because, as it has for three
decades, Sindlinger & Co. of Wallingford, Pa., calls hundreds of
households every week, asking them highly detailed questions about
job status, money supply and more.
   It is founder Sindlinger's contention that the consumer still
drives the economy, and that the consumer cannot do so without a
job and income and confidence. More and more he has found these in
the Heartland. And more.
   The improvement in the Heartland economy, he says, is
attributable mainly to small, entrepreneurial companies employing
fewer than 200 workers. It is a finding, he suggests, that
indicates a new, different, more vigorous Heartland.
   For the two weeks that ended March 7, he found that 22.1 percent
of workers there were employed by companies with payrolls of more
than 200, but that 31.7 percent were self-employed or worked in
companies of 10 or fewer workers.
   He says that finding is significant. ``These companies are
finding their goods more competitive. Especially among small
entrepreneurial companies, there is an increased willingness to
expand into foreign markets,'' he says.
   It is because of such successes that Sindlinger's consumer
confidence index has now risen to 66 percent, ``in the boom area.''
It means two things:
   1. That two out of every three households nationwide has
experienced either income gains or no loss in income over the past
six months.
   2. That two of three households are either positive or neutral
about expectations for income, employment and business conditions.
   Based on these findings, Sindlinger has scoffed at forecasts of
a recession to follow the Oct. 19 stock market crash. In fact, he
has raised his outlook for growth in the gross national product,
though he sees some signs of inflation to come.
   Smart companies, he observes, have been capitalizing on the
split economy. Some are his clients, and if they have acted on his
analysis, he says, they have been able to place the proper
inventories in proper geographical areas.
   Politicians might not be as wise. ``Not one of the presidential
contenders has taken advantage of it yet,'' he says.
   But no matter who wins, he suggests they pay attention to small
business.
   Although the growth in the U.S. economy is the result of
strength among small companies, he says, ``it is the GMs and
Bethlehem Steels who have the time and the money to lobby Congress
for the favors they believe they need.''
   But the jobs, especially those in the Heartland Economy, are
coming from small companies. The workers know it. And he suggests
the politicians better begin learning it.

   What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Cary
Grant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common? They
have never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements.
   Such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence
of the unfairness of Hollywood's highest prize. Oscar's 60-year
history is filled with examples of the film world's highest
achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences.
   The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movie
``Broadcast News'' was nominated though he wasn't, and Spielberg
who was left out in the cold with his ``Empire of the Sun.''
   Although ``Broadcast News'' won seven major nominations,
including best picture and three acting categories, Brooks was
strangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch.
   Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its
director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored
``Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on
April 11 have been significantly reduced.
   Brooks did better in 1984 when his ``Terms of Endearment'' took
the lion's share of Oscars, including best picture and director.
   Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' won six nominations this year,
none of them major and none for director. Two years ago, ``The
Color Purple'' received 11 nominations but not for him as director.
The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.
   ``I'm floored by this,'' Spielberg said upon receiving his DGA
award. ``This is the last thing I expected to happen. ... If some
of you are making a statement _ thank God _ I thank you for that.''
   Why the Spielberg slight? Some observers cite the fact that only
257 directors nominate for the Academy Awards, and many are
veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are
the biggest moneymakers in history (``Jaws,'' ``E.T.,'' ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark'').
   The Academy appeared to make amends last year by presenting
Spielberg with the Irving Thalberg award for ``consistently high
quality of production.'' There was no mention of the fact that
Spielberg is primarily a director, not a producer.
   The Thalberg award has come in handy to acknowledge giants who
were overlooked for individual awards. The recipients have included
Cecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman
and Mervyn Leroy.
   The honorary award has also proved useful to salve the Academy's
conscience. Charlie Chaplin received one at the first Academy
Awards for his creation of ``The Circus'' and again at the 44th
awards for ``the incalculable effect he has had in making motion
pictures the art form of this century.''
   Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch,
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, Maurice
Chevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G.
Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are others who
have received honorary awards.
   Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected to win an
Academy Award. ``I'd have to blacken my teeth first,'' he quipped,
alluding to the Academy's fondness for actors who portray bums and
downtrodden characters.
   Alfred Hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why he
failed to win an Oscar: ``I suppose it was a matter of
carelessness.''
   The overlooking of classic films and the industry's most
talented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute.
   For example, ``Citizen Kane,'' which customarily places No. 1 on
polls of the greatest American films, was nominated in 1941 for
best picture (there were 10 nominees in those days), for Orson
Welles' performance, direction and co-scripting with Herman
Mankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, plus art direction, sound,
music and editing.
   The only Oscar for ``Citizen Kane'' was for the script. ``How
Green Was My Valley'' was named best picture.
   Billy Wilder's classic comedy, ``Some Like It Hot,'' failed to
be nominated as best picture, as did Chaplin's ``Modern Times,''
Hawks' ``Red River'' and Woody Allen's ``Manhattan.''
   Oh, well. Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line from ``Some
Like It Hot'': ``Nobody's perfect.''

<HEAD>OSCAR COUNTDOWN: A Statuette Is Born</HEAD>
<HEAD>Real Star of Glittering Awards Has Down-to-Earth Beginnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The origins of the Oscar, a golden symbol of
artistic triumph, are more down to earth than many of the glitzy
stars who take home the greatly cherished statuette.
   Far from the studios, sun and sea of the California West Coast,
is a cluster of brick buildings in a residential-industrial
neighborhood of Chicago. Under a cloak of security, this is where
the trophy manufacturer R.S. Owens & Co. creates the Academy Award
prize.
   Winning the Oscar contract may not compare with winning the
Oscar itself. However, it was a coup for Owens seven years ago and
remains a source of company pride. The statuettes used to be made
by Dodge, Inc., at a small manufacturing plant in Crystal Lake,
Ill., some 25 miles northwest of Chicago.
   With 300 employees, Owens makes about 95 percent of the most
prestigious awards in the country, including the television
industry's Emmys, advertising's Clios, the Super Bowl trophy and
the Miss America awards. But Oscar tops them all.
   Most people don't know the names of awards in other fields, much
less what they look like, said Bernice Estka, who handles the Oscar
account for Owens.
   ``Oscar, you know,'' she said.
   Each model of the muscular knight, who holds a sword and stands
impassively on a reel of film, is hand cast from a single steel
mold.
   Oscar was designed by Cedric Gibbons, then head of the MGM
studio's art department. He sketched the prototype on a table cloth
in 1927. Sculptor George Stanley transformed the sketch into the
coveted statuette.
   The trophy was named Oscar by longtime Academy employee Margaret
Herrick, who took one look at the statuette and declared that it
reminded her of her Uncle Oscar, Estka said.
   The design has remained unchanged since 1927, and the mold,
which was turned over to Owens with the contract, is kept in a
vault.
   Neither Owens nor the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &
Sciences, whose members' votes decide the winners, would reveal the
price tag on Oscar.
   ``I like to say that they are worth a million dollars to the
people who receive them,'' said Owen R. Siegel, founder and chief
executive officer of the trophy company. ``Once you have got an
Oscar _ you've made it.''
   ``If we say it only costs a certain amount to make, what does
that do to the image?'' said Patrick Stockstill, the Academy
historian who will hand the Oscars to presenters at the 60th annual
awards presentation on April 11.
   ``It is the most famous award and the most prestigious. It
thrusts a person into the limelight and brings additional cash into
their pockets.''
   The Oscar's value as a symbol far exceeds the cost of the pewter
form and electroplating of copper, nickel, silver and gold, Estka
said. However, from 1943-47, because of war rationing, the
statuettes were made of plaster. They were later replaced.
   Early each year, nine or 10 Owens employees set aside the work
of the moment such as Little League trophies or bowling prizes to
make the Oscars. Each 13{-inch, 8{-pound statuette takes about five
man hours to craft, Estka said.
   The awards are handcrafted in the 100,000 square-foot facility
with cinderblock walls whose concrete floors often are shrewn with
metal shavings.
   The academy usually needs about 100 Oscars, but this year's
order was for 150 because of the Academy is celebrating its 60th
anniversary, Estka said.
   The Oscars are locked in a separate room each night. As each
statuette is finished, it is packed in plastic foam. When all are
ready, they're put in a sealed truck for the trip to Los Angeles.
   ``We don't have an elaborate secret route, but only a few people
actually know when they leave or how they go to Los Angeles,'' said
Scott Siegel, president of the company.
   Once in a secret Los Angeles warehouse, the Oscars wait in
muffled silence for the night they make dreams come true.

   In the Tang Dynasty 1,000 years ago,
boatmen carried rice and supplies to fight the northern barbarians.
Today, boatmen on barges still pass through Huaian, but now they
carry coal and bricks to keep China's great metropolises humming.
   Life goes on, changing but always the same along the world's
longest man-made waterway, the 1,000-mile Grand Canal, which Hua
Yuhua, a local official, describes ``as great a feat as the Great
Wall.''
   In Huaian, a 1,600-year-old town in coastal Jiangsu province,
the canal remains the lifeline.
   Huaian is a bumpy, four-hour drive from the provincial capital
of Nanjing and has no railway.
   ``We have looked to the water in developing our land,'' said the
local radio station director, Wang Ruoyuan.
   Every day about 1,200 barges, some in convoys of as many as 10,
pass through the town's two locks, where they are lowered or raised
about 10 feet.
   Along the shore, a sea of men in green and blue jackets load and
unload the coal, grain, vegetables, oil, roof tile, cotton, lumber
and gravel that traverse the 220-mile Jiangsu stretch from the
Yangtze River in the south to the city of Xuzhou in the north.
   The lucky ones have donkeys, but for most a strong back and
sturdy shoulders are crucial. People strapped to harnesses tug at
carts and wagons. On one bridge, a unique pulley system helps them
up an incline.
   Bicycles weave around bridge-side stalls that sell cabbage,
oranges, soft drinks and sugar cane. Children gather around to
watch an elderly couple puff oats with a hand bellows that fires a
blackened iron pressure vessel.
   Fishermen come by with cormorants perched on bicycle handlebars,
taking the black seabirds to catch fish for them.
   Work on the canal began in the 6th century B.C. But the early
7th century Emperor Yangdi built the main sections, from the
western capital of Luoyang eastward and the north-south channel
linking Hangzhou to Beijing, China's modern-day capital.
   Hundreds of thousands are believed to have been mobilized for
the project.
   Upon its completion, the emperor sailed its length at the head
of a flotilla extending in close file for 60 miles.
   During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), what served as the ministry
of transport was in Huaian, and the city had a population of
200,000, double its current number, town official Hua said.
   The canal fell into disrepair after the Tang Dynasty, but the
Kublai Khan rebuilt it in the 13th century.
   The Communist government, after coming to power in 1949, has
built an extensive irrigation and flood control system to make life
easier for the people of this waterlogged, impoverished area.
   The town fathers also hope Huaian's rich historical heritage
will draw tourists. It was the home to Han Xin, the Han dynasty
(206 B.C.-220 A.D.) general; Wu Chengen, writer of ``Journey to the
West,'' the classic of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and the late
Premier Chou En-lai.
   One small temple along the canal has a statue in memory of the
``washerwoman,'' an upright woman who helped Gen. Han when he was a
poor boy and later refused a reward of 1,000 taels of silver.
   Near that temple, outside their one-room brick homes with
upswept tile roofs, the washerwomen of today are still down at the
canal, hard at work.

   The school board president in Jackson, Mich., disagreed strongly
with a recent board vote that outlawed paddling. ``I went to a
school where we were spanked when we misbehaved. It didn't damage
us,'' said L. Michael Ketchens. ``It didn't teach us that physical
violence is the only response.''
   Many educators around the nation concur. And yet teachers and
administrators increasingly look to alternative ways of controlling
unruly students: counseling, suspensions and restrictions on
special privileges.
   They cite lawsuits over allegedly abusive corporal punishment
and research indicating that minority and poor students are paddled
disproportionately.
   Spanking has been prohibited in California, Hawaii, Maine,
Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode
Island and Vermont. Movements are afoot in at least 15 more states
to try to outlaw corporal punishment.
   And, as in Jackson, Mich., many localities have banned spanking
_ among them, the school districts of Anchorage, Alaska; Atlanta;
Baltimore; Chicago; Cleveland; Columbus; the District of Columbia;
Fargo, N.D.; Minneapolis; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh;
Portland, Ore.; Seattle; St. Louis; and Tucson, Ariz.
   California child psychologist Adah Maurer, who has spent the
last decade in an anti-paddling crusade, said it's been difficult
to persuade state legislators to support anti-spanking bills
because they get mixed signals.
   Teachers don't like to be told how to run their classrooms, said
Maurer, founder of End Violence Against the Next Generation Inc.
   ``They vote for the status quo. If paddles are in use, teachers
will vote in favor of them. We have found that all over,'' she
said. ``But if they've never had corporal punishment, as in New
Jersey, they don't miss it.''
   The National Education Association is on record as opposing
corporal punishment in schools, but its position is not binding on
the various state chapters.
   Religious educators also are of two minds. Some favor banning
corporal punishment, saying violence begets violence. Others cite
Solomon's biblical admonition: ``Spare the rod, spoil the child.''
   Fundamentalist schools lobbied to be exempted from a Michigan
anti-spanking bill that's supported by Roman Catholic schools.
   ``Corporal punishment is too risky,'' said Sister Dorita
Wotiska, superintendent of the Diocese of Lansing Roman Catholic
schools. ``When you hit a child out of anger, the chances of
hurting a child is beyond what you know.''
   But Paul Vanaman, president of the Michigan Association of
Christian Schools, said spanking ``gets results. Why tie everyone's
hands because of the possibility that something might happen on the
ten-thousandth time?''
   The U.S. Department of Education has estimated public school
children are swatted about 1.3 million times a year. But the
figures don't differentiate between a tap with a hand and paddling
that raises welts and do not show the frequency of physical injury
or emotional damage.
   The Education Department's biannual survey of 20 percent of the
nation's school districts, from which the figures were derived,
also showed wide racial and regional fluctuations: children were
more likely to be physically punished in the South, and black
children were paddled at a higher rate than whites.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1977 that corporal punishment
did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but the justices
may take another look at the issue.
   The high court is considering whether to hear arguments on an
appeal from a New Mexico case. The parents of Teresa Garcia contend
the 9-year-old's constitutional rights were violated when she was
paddled hard enough to require medical treatment.
   They say she was hit on two occasions, first as punishment for
hitting a boy who kicked her and later for saying she saw a teacher
kiss a student's father.
   Maurer said her research shows that educators get used to using
the paddle, then employ it for lesser and lesser offenses.
   ``There's a lot of sadism,'' she said. ``Children are hit for
academic matters, like not finishing their homework. They're hit
for coming in a little late.''
   In Jackson Hole, Wyo., a sixth-grader was spanked with a wooden
paddle by his teacher and about 19 classmates. The offense: getting
a grade of 79 percent on a math test. A lawsuit later was settled
for more than $20,000.
   In a Pennsylvania case, the parents of a seventh-grader say
they're preparing to sue over the paddling administered to their
son and the rest of his class. The reason: one classmate reported
his math book missing and no one owned up to the theft. The parents
blame the paddling for the seizures their son has suffered since.
   Those aren't isolated cases, according to Irwin Hyman, director
of the National Center for the Study of Corporal Punishment at
Temple University in Philadelphia.
   ``Teachers have legally beaten children severely enough to leave
welts, lacerations and fractured bones,'' he said, adding that he
has documented hundreds of cases. Children have sometimes suffered
nerve damage and in rare cases have even died after being required
to do exhausting exercises, he said.
   Hyman said corporal punishment can inflict on children a version
of post-traumatic stress disorder, the psychological damage
associated with war veterans.
   The people who teach teachers-to-be say they emphasize
discipline techniques that don't rely on the threat of pain.
   ``Most behavior problems can be prevented,'' said Michigan State
University professor Cassandra Book. ``Those people who engage in
corporal punishment don't have other ideas in their head on how to
cope with kids' misbehavior.''
   She urges teachers to give youngsters reasons to behave _ for
instance, by setting up contracts in which they agree to give up
certain privileges if they misbehave.
   Sister Wotiska's technique for stopping misbehavior is a
well-directed stare _ ``an evil eye,'' she called it.
   The National Coalition of Advocates for Students said it's
concerned that paddlings may be racially motivated.
   ``Corporal punishment is used most frequently on poor, minority
students,'' said Joan McCarty First, director of the Boston-based
advocacy group, which analyzed data from the federal government's
most recent school survey.
   Black students made up 16 percent of the nation's school
enrollment and accounted for 28 percent of the episodes of corporal
punishment, according to the analysis.
   In individual state analyses, the group found similar
discrepancies.
   For instance, in Arizona, where black students constitute 4
percent of enrollment, they accounted for 13 percent of the
episodes of physical punishment. In Connecticut, 10 percent
enrollment, 73 percent punishment rate; in Wisconsin, 8 and 39
percent; in Ohio, 14 and 26 percent; in Michigan, 17 and 25
percent; in Arkansas, 25 and 35 percent.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
supports efforts to ban corporal punishment in schools.
   Also on the record as supporting anti-spanking efforts are the
American Medical Association, American Bar Association, American
Civil Liberties Association and National Parent-Teacher Association.

<HEAD>Peru's `President of Hope' in Trouble at Midterm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the youthful Alan Garcia took office as
Peru's ``president of hope'' in July 1985, his energetic policies
won applause from a country besieged for decades by economic and
governmental failures.
   But midway through his five-year term, the 38-year-old populist
has been battered by unrelenting poverty, a leftist insurgency and
growing social chaos.
   In some eyes, Garcia's honeymoon ended in 1986 when he gave
government forces a free hand to quell prison riots in Lima, and
more than 250 leftist guerrilla inmates were slain in a bloodbath.
   Most of Garcia's support in the middle and upper classes has
ebbed since this past July, when he accused Peruvian banks of
exploitation and announced plans to nationalize them.
   Current economic woes have further frayed Garcia's backing even
among the working class and poor, toward whom most of his policies
have been directed and from whom he commands his largest following.
   Garcia's approval rating has fallen from 96 percent during his
first months in office to 44 percent, according to the independent
polling firm Datum.
   ``Alan Garcia is just too young. He scares the middle class,''
said Jose Castro, who drives a taxi between jobs as a civil
engineer. ``The generals might have to come in and straighten
things out again.''
   Though most analysts doubt a military coup is likely, Castro's
comment reflects a constant worry among many people recalling
military rule from 1968 to 1980.
   The 6-foot-3 Garcia won office by a 2-1 margin with a campaign
promising a ``different future.''
   ``There was a massive need to bet on someone who could pull Peru
out of this crisis,'' said Luis Pasara, columnist for Caretas,
Peru's leading news weekly, terming Garcia's appeal as emotional
and lacking in substance.
   Garcia and his center-left Aprista Party, which won a majority
in Congress, moved with dizzying speed to implement policies he
frequently terms ``nationalistic and anti-imperialistic.''
   He limited repayments of Peru's foreign debt, now $16.5 billion,
to a ceiling of 10 percent of exports.
   ``The voracious appetites of imperialists will not be satisfied
with the hunger of the people,'' Garcia said.
   He used the money owed foreign banks to finance an economic
reactivation program that cut inflation to 63 percent and
catapulted the country from its deepest depression this century.
Peru led Latin America with 8.5 percent and 6.7 percent economic
growth in 1986 and 1987.
   The new chief executive took steps to root out police
corruption, decentralize government, boost the fight against
cocaine traffickers, gain more control over the military and reduce
human rights violations in the anti-insurgency campaign.
   His reputation as a ``bad boy'' of the Americas grew as he
nationalized a U.S. oil company, banned foreign companies from
remitting profits to parent firms abroad, drew closer trade links
with the Soviet Union and embraced Nicaragua's leftist government,
while condemning U.S. involvement in Central America.
   ``I am going to speak until Latin America unites and defeats the
imperialism of the rich nations,'' Garcia said in one of his
frequent volleys against U.S. and European foreign policy, which he
blames for keeping Latin America ``dependent and on its knees.''
   Such talk has eroded much of Garcia's foreign support.
   His foes accuse him of being a demagogue, impetuous in making
decisions and insincere about keeping promises.
   Government officials and supporters acknowledge that Garcia has
made serious political and economic errors. But they say the
problems are being corrected and recent fence-mending efforts
reflect a new presidential maturity.
   The bank takeover polarized the nation and awoke a powerful
center-right coalition. Congress went ahead, nevertheless, with the
nationalization plan but only one of the 10 banks affected now is
under government control because of legal challenges by owners of
the others. Garcia's Aprista Party, however, has proposed
amendments softening the nationalization plan in an effort to
lessen the strident opposition to it.
   In the meantime, many foreign companies have cut back on
operations or left the country, prompting the government to revise
policies to attract more foreign investment.
   Spurred by heavy government spending, inflation is expected to
rocket to a record 300 percent this year. The country is virtually
out of dollar reserves due to falling exports and a cutoff in loans
by foreign lenders.
   With the economy pitching toward a recession, Garcia in early
March announced a ``war economy,'' with steep price increases, and
appealed to rival political parties to help find solutions.
   The response, however, has been lukewarm.

<HEAD>TV Show Credited With Capturing Some of America's `Most Wanted'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Fox Television's ``America's Most Wanted'' has
become the best thing since Post Office walls for law enforcement
officials, who say the innovative show has led to the capture of
three long-sought fugitives.
   ``This show is just what the fugitive doesn't want,'' said Rex
Tombs, FBI agent who acts as bureau liaison with the Sunday evening
program.
   ``America's Most Wanted,'' produced in Washington because of the
proximity to federal police agencies, is a unique mix of
dramatization, documentary, news, public service and interactive
television.
   The show uses actors and sometimes actual victims to dramatize
crimes, filming when possible on sites where the incidents
occurred. The show uses film and still photos of the real fugitives
and sends camera teams out to cover stakeouts. And it makes direct
appeals for people to get involved in the chase with a 20-line
toll-free number, 800-CRIME88.
   A dozen law enforcement officers, whose expenses are paid by the
show, are assigned by their agencies each week to monitor the calls
_ sometimes as many as 1,600 _ that follow each broadcast.
   ``We don't have anything else that can get the message across
the nation in prime time. This is the only thing we have other than
Post Office walls which are not that effective,'' said Dick
Pederson of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Law enforcement officials credit the show and viewer response
for the capture of at least three fugitives, including:
   _Steven Paul Mack, who was wanted for questioning in the
February 1987 slaying of 21-year-old beauty queen Karen Grace
Winlett of Carmichael, Calif., and the death of 19-year-old Annette
Huddle in Ohio.
   _Donald Adams, a convicted rapist in Boston.
   _David James Roberts, who escaped from the prison where he had
been serving six life terms for burning to death a young couple and
their 1-year-old child in Indiana because the man had witnessed him
stealing tires.
   ``We're making a smaller place for these guys to hide,'' said
the show's host, John Walsh, whose 6-year-old son was kidnapped and
killed in 1981. Walsh directs eight child-protection centers around
the country and has become a widely recognized lobbyist for laws
protecting children. The unsolved murder of his son, Adam, was the
subject of two television movies.
   Walsh said he agreed to do the show only if it would meet high
journalistic standards, avoid gratuitous violence and allow him
control over his scripts.
   ``So far Fox has kept their word,'' he said. ``The violence on
this show is off the evening news. This is not a nightmare turned
into a TV show; this is the nightmare of reality.''
   Michael Linder, the show's producer, said it tries to be
meticulous in the details it presents about criminals and clearly
identifies dramatizations so tipsters won't send police after the
actors it uses.
   He said he is also exploring ways to show less dramatic crimes
such as telephone fraud.
   ``I don't want to get the reputation for doing only flamboyant,
flashy stories,'' Linder said. ``The last thing we want is to be
perceived as is Adam 12 or Movie of the Week.''
   And, he said, there are no plans to offer rewards for capturing
criminals, because he doesn't want it to start looking like a game
show.
   ``America's Most Wanted'' is aired on Fox-owned stations in
seven major cities covering about one-fourth of U.S. TV viewers.
With its success in catching criminals and attracting viewers,
several independent stations have begun to pick it up.
   Although the show now is taped about two hours before air time,
plans call for the show to be broadcast live.
   One of the most recent captures attributed the show came earlier
this month on a tip from an Ohio woman who told the Marion County
sheriff she recognized Mack from an episode on ``America's Most
Wanted.''
   The tipster didn't know where Mack was but also told the sheriff
about a call she received from Salt Lake City about a man named
Sean Paul Lanier. She apparently connected the call with Mack.
   The Ohio sheriff sent Mack's fingerprints to Utah where
``America's Most Wanted'' is not aired, and on Tuesday police
discovered Mack and Lanier were one.
   Sacramento County sheriff's spokeswoman Sharon Telles said the
TV show provided deputies with 170 tips.
   ``I think this is going to put some fear into somebody,'' she
said. ``It's a wonderful tool for us.''
   Two weeks ago, Adams, the convicted rapist, hurriedly moved out
of the Boston area apartment where he had been living for several
weeks. Police, who had been staking out the apartment, said he fled
because he saw the dramatization of his brutal 1983 attack on a
Boston area woman on TV that night. Adams was arrested four days
later.
   ``The show helped flush him out,'' said Capt. David Mattioli of
the Massachusetts State Police. ``It was a classic example of a
cooperative effort between `America's Most Wanted' and police.''
   The program's first success came with its first episode, which
had actually been filmed eight months before it was shown last Feb.
7.
   FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich appeared the following week to thank
viewers who called the show with information about Roberts, a
prison escapee who had been serving six life terms.
   Ahlerich said that before the tips started pouring in the FBI
had no idea that Roberts was living on New York's Staten Island
with a job as coordinator for a homeless shelter, where residents
praised him as a ``sweet guy,'' someone who would help anyone in
trouble.
   Other fugitives profiled on the show include members of a
Jamaican hit squad sought in a drug-related massacre of five people
in a suburb of Washington, D.C., and William ``Pops'' Pegram,
72-year-old bank robber who has blazed a 40-year trail of crime
across several states.

<TEXT>
   Fifty-seven tractor-trailers backed up to a
Kansas City, Mo., loading dock earlier this month to collect their
quarry _ six billion ``E'' stamps that had been salted away in a
limestone cave for the next increase in postal rates.
   It was one step in the complex process of raising postal rates
that began March 4, when the independent Postal Rate Commission
recommended a sweeping series of rate increases, including a
25-cent first-class stamp. The rate increase takes effect April 3.
   Assistant Postmaster General Gordon C. Morison knew there would
not be enough time to print new stamps to meet the nation's 100
million-a-day stamp appetite.
   So he turned to the ``E'' stamps that had been stored in Kansas
City for more than a year. The stamps have no denomination _ when
they were printed, no one knew just how large a rate increase would
be enacted.
   ``We printed six billion. It takes about 13.6 billion stamps to
make a rate change. Six billion stamps probably will last us around
45 to 60 days ... in that period of time we can print enough with
denominations to get the next six billion stamps out there and
replenish the inventory,'' Morison said in an interview.
   ``If we waited to get the rate change (to start printing stamps)
... there would be pockets of shortages throughout the country,''
he said.
   It took four days to finish loading the leased tractor-trailers,
which fanned out across the nation delivering the stamps to
sectional postal centers for distribution to local post offices.
   Last Wednesday, the day after the Postal Service board of
governors put its formal seal of approval on the new rates, the
special stamps went on sale across the nation.
   While the public will likely take most notice of the new ``E''
stamps, it takes no less than 45 different postal items to get
through a rate change, according to Morison.
   There are the six billion 25-cent stamps to follow the E stamps,
plus millions of 1- and 3-cent stamps that will be needed to make
up the new rates for people using up old stamps.
   There's postal stationery _ envelopes and postal cards bearing
the new rates _ plus new stamps bearing the 45-cent international
rate and stamps with the new bulk rates, non-profit rates, Express
Mail rates, official mail rates for government use and even special
``E'' envelopes to mail Savings Bonds.
   And for each type of stamp, more than one form is printed _ for
example ``E'' stamps will come in coils, booklets and sheets; there
will be three different booklets of the current 25-cent Jack London
stamp, new booklets of a 25-cent pheasant stamp and other new
items, Morison said.
   To print the stamps needed for the changeover, the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing used 915,000 pounds of ink and 4,680 tons of
paper, Morison said. He wasn't sure how much glue was used.
   ``I don't think people realize,'' how many stamps it takes, he
said, commenting that many people ask why the undenominated stamps
are used during changeovers.
   If all the new stamps required were stacked one on top of
another _ the thin way _ he said, the pile would be 571 miles tall.
   Of course stacking them the thin way makes the smallest possible
pile, and Morison had statistics with much more impressive
illustrations.
   Many people buy stamps in rolls of 100, he said. If all the
rolls needed for the changeover were stretched out, they would go
around the Earth twice at the equator, with a strip 5,255 miles
long leftover.
   The other popular sales method is the booklet, he noted, with
the consumer seeing only a little folder a few inches long.
   ``If we laid out all the stamp booklets we are producing they
would stretch 10,623 miles, or a round trip between San Francisco
and China, so that's why we think we have enough booklets,'' he
said.
   Indeed, the last time rates changed, booklets proved to be the
major problem, he said, with supplies never able to keep up with
demand.
   This time he is determined to have enough.
   In addition, Morison said, postal and business forms have to be
converted to the new rates, decals changed in vending machines,
rate charts replaced, new software produced for computer mail
terminals and postal scales changed.
   In addition to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the
American Bank Note Co. has contracted to print some new stamp
booklets to help in the changeover.
   Then comes the problem of getting the new stamps into the hands
of the public _ at a time when budget problems imposed by Congress
have forced a curtailment of hours at many offices.
   To help, Postmaster General Anthony Frank has ordered offices to
extend their hours during the next two weeks. In addition flyers
will be sent to homes to encourage purchase of stamps by mail.
   Plus, telephone stamp sales have also been extended nationwide.
Callers can use credit cards to buy stamps by calling
1-800-STAMP24. There is a $2 service charge.
   Officials don't expect people to be happy paying more, but
Morison says he hopes at least for fewer complaints about the
appearance of the ``E'' stamps.
   Past undenominated stamps have been rather plain stamps with the
head of an eagle. The E stamp has a colorful space-based image of
the Earth because, Morison says, ``over the years we have been
besieged by the public with requests for pretty stamps.''
   ``There's another thing we have to consider as we change rates,
especially on the ordinary issues. We have to make them discernably
different ... because our clerks have gotten used to seeing''
certain stamps.
   For example he cited the popular flag stamps. There will be a
new flag stamp at the 25-cent rate, but the design will be changed
enough to make it easy for clerks to be sure the correct stamp is
being used.
   In 1981, the Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp
honoring White House architect James Hoban at the 18-cent rate, and
then reissued the same stamp at 20 cents when rates changed.
   ``It wasn't a good idea and we don't plan to repeat it,''
Morison said of the confusion.
   With all this effort, when will they start thinking about the
next change and planning an ``F'' stamp?
   ``Well, we'll probably start looking at that in the near future,
at least from the design standpoint,'' he said.
   But that doesn't mean a new rate increase is being considered,
he cautioned. ``We don't look so much at the next rate case, quite
frankly, as we look at what might happen between rate cases.
   ``Theoretically, you could have a requirement for a substitute
stamp in several fashions, for example if we didn't have the
printing capabilities for stamps for some reason, we would have
stamps to tide us over. Or if we had a lawsuit that would change
the rates suddenly on us, either higher or lower.''

<HEAD>The Fevered Cultural Temperature of Thatcher's Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Hare, a leading British playwright, has
remarked that when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came to office
nearly nine years ago, the usually vibrant, challenging British
theater fell silent.
   ``A lot of writers stopped writing because they didn't know how
to deal with her arrival,'' said the author of ``Plenty'' and other
works. ``Now people are really beginning to get to grips.''
   Today, secure in her third term of office, Mrs. Thatcher's
imprint on Britain is indelible _ nowhere more so than in the arts,
where disaffection is being turned into the stuff of provocative
films and plays.
   The topicality itself is nothing new, as ``angry young
playwrights'' such as John Osborne and Arnold Wesker and such
filmmakers as Karel Reisz and John Schlesinger were demonstrating
30 years ago.
   But no post-war government, Conservative or Labor, has come
under such concerted artistic attack as Mrs.Thatcher's, and few
serious works today fail to address themselves somehow to the
phenomenon of Thatcherism, most often from an angry, left-wing
viewpoint.
   Emasculated politically by the march of Thatcherite capitalism,
the left has dug in on stage and screen to attack her bourgeois,
pro-business values.
   So sustained is the onslaught that a backlash is being felt from
artists who ordinarily would stay out of the political crossfire.
   ``I'd much rather have a frank disinterest in culture than a
phony and deliberate one,'' novelist Peter Ackroyd recently said.
``And I find the patronizing snobbery of those who despise Mrs.
Thatcher and her supporters very unpleasant indeed.''
   In a recent Sunday Times article, right-wing historian Norman
Stone of Oxford University said the growing tendency was ``to run
down Mrs. Thatcher, to assume that capitalism is parasitism, that
the established order in this country is imperialist, racist,
profiteering.''
   Earlier, critic Francis King had asked in the conservative
Sunday Telegraph: ``Why is there so much stage Left?'' and yearned
for a play to counter the ``vicious denigration of poor old Mrs.
Thatcher'' which he saw proliferating in theater.
   Many of the works have a common message: Under Mrs. Thatcher,
Britain is becoming a greedy society, heartless to the poor,
hostile to free speech, in thrall equally to nuclear weapons and
America under President Reagan.
   Works both new and old are being mobilized against Thatcherism.
In Alan Ayckbourn's ``A Small Family Business,'' the upstanding
hero falls into a spiral of corruption in which vanishing paper
clips become a metaphor for vanishing morals. Olwen Wymark has
adapted Emile Zola's 1880 novel ``Nana'' for the London stage
because, she says, it matches her sense of Britain today.
   Both dramatists acknowledge the anti-Thatcherite message. ``I
couldn't have written that play 10 years ago,'' Ayckbourn, 48, said
in an interview. ``The disease (of greed) much more deeply
permeates the society now than it once did.''
   The American-born Wymark says she chose ``Nana'' because ``the
book is about the kind of tendencies Thatcher has been able to nail
to the mast. ... I feel very strongly that the urge towards greed
is being fostered, the sense of communal responsibility is drying
up.''
   Hanif Kureishi, the Anglo-Pakistani screenwriter of two
low-budget hit movies, ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid'' and ``My
Beautiful Laundrette,'' says he and director Stephen Frears want
their movies ``to shoot bullets at Thatcherism and everything it
stands for.''
   ``Because things are so terrible in this country, we have to be
able to look at what's going on and discuss it publicly,'' Kureishi
said in an interview.
   ``Sammy and Rosie'' opens with images of a riot-torn,
rubbish-strewn London and the voice of Mrs. Thatcher promising to
tackle the problems of the inner cities.
   Other works share Kureishi's view: David Hare's ``Wetherby'' and
Derek Jarman's ``The Last of England'' on screen; Karim Alrawi's
``A Colder Climate'' and Kay Adshead's ``Thatcher's Women'' on
stage.
   On television, various drama series consistently portray the
government as authoritarian, secrecy-obsessed, even murderous.
``Spitting Image,'' a satirical program, uses rubber dolls to
portray Mrs. Thatcher and her ministers as Hitler's Nazis.
   More benignly, John Mortimer in ``Paradise Postponed'' has
pointed up the irony of post-war Britain: the traditional
working-class vote has swung to Mrs. Thatcher, the self-made
grocer's daughter, because she, rather than the ideological left,
embodies blue-collar aspirations.
   Mortimer, a committed Laborite, gently mourns the loss of an
older, dreamier, more compassionate Britain. Other playwrights,
such as Caryl Churchill in ``Serious Money'' Tony Marchant in
``Speculators,'' vilify the London's financial district as a nest
of greed, fraud and raw ambition.
   Director Christine Edzard's six-hour film version of Charles
Dickens' novel ``Little Dorrit'' draws parallels between the
Victorian virtues and vices and Mrs. Thatcher's Britain. Its
juxtaposition of obscene wealth and tragic destitution, she says,
makes it ``the Dickens novel very much closest to today.''
   However, some critics feel the point is being stretched.
Reviewing Nick Darke's 1983 play ``The Crimes of Vautrin,'' which
used an Honore de Balzac work to indict a society glutted by
materialism, critic Victoria Radin complained in The Observer
newspaper: ``It is a gray day when Balzac can be bleakly molded to
symbolize the dread face of Thatcherite Britain.''
   But Mrs. Thatcher does have defenders, powerful figures in the
arts such as painter Francis Bacon and novelists Kingsley Amis and
Anthony Powell who argue that the resentment is largely
intellectual snobbery toward her bourgeois background.
   Historian Stone wonders why there are not more films such as ``A
Room With a View'' and ``Chariots of Fire'' which extol traditional
British virtues.
   But Hanif Kureishi feels the truths of England today take
precedence over golden-hued images of its past: ``There are
actually so few films that show life in Great Britain at all (that)
we have to make films about life as it is. There are so many
stories to be told, and we've got to get on with it.''

   The dollar moved lower against most major foreign
currencies in Europe today in the absence of market-moving news.
Gold prices also fell.
   Dealers said the dollar was unlikely to move much during the
day, since no important economic news was expected.
   Officials delayed until next week today's planned release of
West German January trade data, seen by some in the market as an
indicator of the near-term trend for the mark.
   Dealers said that although the West German trade figures are not
very important for interpreting dollar trends, they are relevant
for investors trading on cross-rates between the mark and major
European currencies.
   Dealers said the market was expected to focus again on the
pound-mark rate. They said the pound is likely to test the key
3.1000-mark level again today after the Bank of England reportedly
intervened late Thursday to push the pound below that level.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.56 yen to a closing 125.74. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 125.84 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6792 West German marks, down from 1.6800;
1.3884 Swiss francs, down from 1.3885; 5.7000 French francs, down
from 5.7120; 1.8860 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8980; 1,242.75

   The dollar closed slightly lower against the
Japanese yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market today, while
stock prices shed more than 150 points following declines in both
currency and stock markets overseas.
   The dollar opened at 125.68 yen, down 0.62 yen from its Thursday
closing, and closed the week at 125.74 yen.
   Japan's central bank reportedly purchased an estimated $200-300
million during the morning to prop up the sagging currency. The
Bank of Japan does not comment on its monetary policies, including
market intervention.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 113.95 points Thursday, closed today at
25,626.71, down 154.57 points, or 0.59 percent.
   The Tokyo market ``was discouraged largely by an overnight
decline in the New York market,'' said Masahiro Umemori, a stock
researcher at Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage firm.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 43.77 points to close at
2,023.87 points Thursday.
   Umemori said stock prices in Tokyo kept rising ``at a rapid
pace'' in recent weeks and just ``took a little respite the past
two days.''
   Commenting on foreign exchange transactions, a dealer at the
Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were
``no major negative market-affecting factors domestically'' to
explain the dollar decline.
   She said there still was a chance for ``the yen's further
appreciation against the dollar'' and predicted the dollar would
hover at a range between 123.00-127.00 yen next week.

<HEAD>Thrift Executive Charged With Providing Prostitutes To Board
Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former thrift executive has been charged with
falsifying documents, making illegal campaign contributions and
procuring prostitutes for members of the institution's board of
directors.
   John V. Hill, one-time vice president of the former Vernon
Savings and Loan Association, was charged Thursday in a felony
information filed by the U.S. Justice Department with conspiracy to
violate federal bank and bribery law.
   Prosecutors said Hill, 40, arranged for sexual favors for Vernon
officers and directors at a three-day 1985 board meeting in Solana
Beach, Calif., in an apparent attempt to win favor with the board.
   Justice Department attorneys said Hill has agreed to plead
guilty and cooperate in a continuing investigation of the thrift.
He could be sentenced to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Vernon Savings was closed by the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. in 1987. In the FSLIC's biggest bailout ever, the
agency committed $1.3 billion to help reopen the institution as a
new thrift, Montfort Savings Association
   Don Dixon, former owner of Vernon Savings, is fighting an FSLIC
lawsuit charging him and other former officers with ``looting'' the
institution.
   Hill falsified documentation justifying $100,000 in payments to
a consultant, and along with others created false board minutes on
renewal and extension of some commercial real estate loans, the
Justice Department said.
   He also was accused of conspiring with a Vernon official to make
$5,400 in illegal state and federal campaign contributions on the
understanding that he would be reimbursed through false expense
vouchers submitted to Vernon.
   Contributions went to such politicians as Rep. Martin Frost and
former Rep. Tom Loeffler of Texas and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,
prosecutors said.
   Prosecutors said there was no evidence that any of the campaign
organizations or candidates knew the contributions were from the
thrift.
   Hill was unavailable for comment Thursday. There is telephone
listing for him in Dallas.

<TEXT>
   A scientist who 14 years ago helped discover
that some chemicals destroy the earth's protective ozone layer says
he's elated that the nation's largest manufacturer of them plans to
eventually end production.
   The announcement by the Du Pont Co. could encourage other
companies to follow suit, says Sherwood Rowland, professor of
atmospheric chemistry at the University of California at Irvine.
   ``I think Du Pont has had more intimate contact with the science
than some of the other companies,'' and thus more credibility,
Rowland said Thursday. ``I am elated by it.''
   Rowland's delight was matched by environmentalists and their
allies in Congress, who used words they rarely use when talking
about large corporations _ things like ``This letter is a wonderful
surprise,'' as Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., put it.
   ``This is a sterling example of corporate environmental
leadership'' added Dan Dudek, an economist with the Environmental
Defense Fund.
   Du Pont's pledge notably omitted any deadline for compliance.
Joe Steed, environmental manager in Du Pont's Freon Products
division, said the length of a changeover to other chemicals could
not yet be determined. He said it will depend on the outcome of
work still under way testing substitutes, but it should be known
``certainly within five years.''
   It was Rowland who, in 1974 with Mario Molina, first mapped the
chemical route _ then just a theory _ by which the long-lived
chlorofluorocarbon or CFC compounds rise high into the
stratosphere, are broken up by ultraviolet rays and liberate
chlorine which destroys the ozone that normally blocks ultraviolet
rays from reaching the ground.
   That ultraviolet causes skin cancer, and there is some evidence
from lab animal tests that it can suppress the immune system. The
Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that each 1 percent
decline in ozone overhead means an increase of 4.8 percent to 7.5
percent in the most common forms of skin cancer. Research is under
way to determine the effect, if any, of increased ultraviolet on
tiny forms of marine life. Some have predicted that they, too,
could be hurt by increased ultraviolet.
   The Rowland-Molina mechanism, scientists say, is almost
certainly what causes the annual 50 percent drop in ozone over the
Antarctic continent each spring, and what has caused a 2.3 percent
decline in ozone over mid-latitudes from 1969 to 1986.
   The mid-latitude decline was announced last week by a panel of
more than 100 scientists who worked under the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration for 17 months in the most thorough
examination ever undertaken of ozone.
   This report was ``important new information,'' Du Pont's
chairman, Richard E. Heckert, wrote members of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee.
   Thus, ``additional actions should be taken for long-term
protection of the ozone layer,'' a switch from Heckert's March 4
letter to the senators saying further action was not needed.
   Thirty-one nations last fall signed a treaty in Montreal calling
for a 50 percent reduction in CFC production by 1998. Heckert's
letter said Du Pont was encouraging other manufacturers and CFC
users to join in ``an orderly transition to the total phaseout'' of
the compounds.
   ``We also plan to urge all nations to treat the new scientific
information seriously, accelerate ratification of the Montreal
Protocol and then immediately initiate the protocol's assessment
process to consider further global limitations on the emission of
CFCs,'' he wrote.
   CFCs have been valued because they are non-toxic and
non-flammable.
   DuPont and other companies have rushed work on substitutes in
recent years, and the company already has announced alternative
products for plastic foam blowing agents and cleaning solvents for
electronics parts. DuPont and others are researching new compounds
for a third major use of CFCs, as refrigeration fluids. The fourth
major use, as aerosol propellants, was banned in the United States
in 1978, though it is still common abroad.
   U.S. aerosols now are powered by hydrocarbon compounds which
slightly enhance the production of ozone at ground level, where it
is a pollutant.
   A Du Pont briefing paper said some jobs might be impossible to
perform with substitutes at a price anyone would pay, but it did
not give specifics.
   More than 2,000 workers in Du Pont plants in seven countries
make about 25 percent of some 2.3 billion pounds of CFC compounds
consumed each year. The company said it sells $600 million worth of
CFC products annually, about 2 percent of its sales revenue.
   Steed said the company hopes that ``over the long term'' jobs
making replacement compounds would offset lost CFC jobs.

   Stock prices fell Friday following the release of
disappointing British trade figures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks was off
12.5 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,770.2 at midday.
   Volume was a relatively active 259.4 million shares, compared to
221.2 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   Traders said the market was unlikely to gain much more before
the opening of the New York market.
   ``If there's strength in the U.S., this market could soar,''
said one London broker. Alternatively, he said, a weaker start in
New York would probably send London shares lower.
   Britain's February trade deficit narrowed to 1.3 billion pounds,
or $2.39 billion, from 1.4 billion pounds in January, and its
current account fell to 720 million pounds from 844 million pounds.
   The deficits were larger than the markets had expected.

<HEAD>Labor Delegation Unable to Change Ford's Mind on Scotland Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has rejected a British union
delegation's appeal that the automaker revive plans for an
electronic components plant in Scotland, a Ford spokesman said.
   The delegation met with Ford officials Thursday night to present
a union agreement to the company and try to persuade Ford to change
its mind.
   But John J. Emmert of Ford's international public affairs
division said Ford officials would stand by their decision not to
build the plant in Dundee, Scotland.
   The $73 million plant would employ about 450 people and
manufacture electronic engine controls to help cars meet tightening
European emissions standards, he said.
   Ford announced its plans not to build in Dundee last week after
it was unable to win a single-union agreement for the plant. The
company's decision followed five months of feuding among British
unions.
   Emmert said the automaker was willing to meet with the unions in
the future but they would have to modify their position.
   ``The feeling was that the unions were not unified in their
commitment,'' he said.
   Earlier, Gavin Laird, head of the Amalgamated Engineering Union,
Britain's second largest, before the five-member delegation left
London's Heathrow Airport, ``We have a monumental task ahead of
us.''
   Britain's national labor federation, the Trades Union Congress,
has agreed to Ford demands for a single-union deal at the proposed
plant.
   However, the Transport and General Workers' Union, Britain's
largest union, remained opposed to a single-union plant. The
transport union represents two-thirds of Ford's more than 32,000
workers in Britain.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .83 to 2,023.04
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 418 up, 575 down and
444 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.23 million shares as of 10

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows, Inflation Steady at 3.3 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed 8
percent in February, while the country's annual inflation rate was
unchanged at 3.3 percent, the government said Friday.
   The trade gap totaled 1.32 billion pounds, or $2.43 billion, far
above market expectations of an 875 million-pound gap, but
economists warned that new customs rules adopted at the beginning
of the year continued to distort the figures.
   The pound, British government bonds and British stocks
nonetheless tumbled on the news. Even if the pound shows renewed
strength in the near term, analysts said the trade report makes a
further cut in interest rates remote.
   In January, the merchandise trade deficit came to a revised 1.44
billion pounds, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   Britain had a current account deficit, which includes invisible
trade such as financial services, of 720 million pounds last month,
narrower than a revised January deficit of 844 million pounds but
wider than market expectations of a gap around 270 million pounds.
   Britain's retail price index rose 0.4 percent in February from
January and was up 3.3 percent from February 1987, the Department
of Employment said in its inflation report.
   In January, the index was unchanged from the previous month and
also up 3.3 percent from a year earlier.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100.0, stood at
103.7 in February, up from 103.3 in January, and up from 100.4 in
February 1987.
   The department said the rise in the index between January and
February was mainly the result of higher prices for fresh and
vegetables, and with the end of the winter sales period, prices for
clothing and other goods were higher.
   Prices were lower for petroleum products and motor vehicles.

<TEXT>
   Police have only bits and pieces of disintegrated
bank checks to go on as they try to crack a dissolving paper caper
that has hit at least two states and cost banks nearly $70,000.
   The checks, treated with a chemical that makes them disintegrate
three or four hours after being deposited, have turned up at five
or six banks in the Chicago area and two in Tennessee, police said
Thursday.
   ``The one I've got in front of me looks like a handful of
ashes,'' said Capt. James Zurawski of the Police Department's
financial crimes division.
   A check clearinghouse said it has warned 142 banks to be on the
lookout for the dissolving checks, which may have an unusual odor
and feel oily.
   The checks, drawn on personal accounts at banks in California
and Chicago, have been reported in about 12 incidents, Zurawski
said. Authorities are also checking a report of a possible
dissolving check in Indiana.
   In most cases, someone opens a new account at a bank with a
small amount of money and later make a large deposit with a
dissolving check. Then the money is withdrawn before the bank
learns the big check was bogus.
   The check's decomposition leaves little for evidence.
   Police believe more than one person is involved, but have no
suspects because of the dissolving evidence, Zurawski said.
   ``So far nobody's been harmed by it. The only clue we've got is
we've talked to the tellers. One teller says that the check felt
oily, another said it had a funny aroma,'' the captain said.
   On Thursday, Zurawski's office received copies of five checks
for a total of $20,000 drawn on a Chicago bank and deposited at a
bank in Memphis, Tenn. ``They're in bits and pieces,'' he said.
   The scam has cost banks about $70,000, he said.
   The Chicago Clearing House Association, which clears checks for
142 members, sent out a memo March 9 warning of the dissolving
checks, said Vice President Tom Tucker.
   The association first learned of the checks from Northern Trust
Bank, which has been hit by at least three disintegrating checks
since Feb. 16, Tucker said.
   Chicago police learned of the dissolving checks about two weeks
ago, Zurawski said. ``What happened was two checks showed up in one
of our downtown banks and they literally dissolved,'' he said.
   Northern learned on March 4 that two other checks for more than
$8,000 dissolved after being processed by Jewel Food Stores, which
offers banking services for some customers.
   Officers from Jewel told the bank that a worker saw one of the
checks start ``to sweat and deteriorate from its borders.'' The
worker tried to prevent further disintegration by putting the check
in a paper envelope, but the envelope also began to dissolve,
investigators said.
   Northern Trust declined to comment. ``We are not at liberty to
discuss customer accounts,'' said a spokeswoman who asked not to be
identified.

   South Korea's gross national product
grew 12 percent last year, down from a growth rate of 12.3 percent
in 1986, the Bank of Korea announced Friday.
   The GNP totaled $118.6 billion last year, compared $98.3 billion
in 1986, according to the central bank's preliminary estimate.
   The central bank had projected a growth rate of 12.2 percent for
1987, based on economic growth in the first three quarters of the
year.
   Bank officails said exports, the mainstay in the Korean ecnomy,
accounted for 46.1 percent of the GNP last year when Korean exports
soared to a record $47.2 billion, up 36.2 percent from a year
earlier.
   The sharp rise in dollar value of the GNP, which measures the
nation's output of goods and services, was attributed partly to the
revaluation last year of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar.
The won rose 8.7 percent last year.

<TEXT>
   ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. says it has
sold the 8.6 percent stake in Swiss drug-industry giant F.
Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. it accumulated since September, abandoning
hopes of merging the companies.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used to buy one or more
health-care companies to expand ICN's distribution capabilities,
the Costa Mesa-based company said.
   In announcing the decision to sell its holdings, ICN said, ``We
understand and respect Hoffmann-La Roche's desire to remain in
family control for the rest of this century.''
   La Roche is controlled tightly by descendants of its founder,
Fritz Hoffman, and industry analysts never gave ICN's overtures
much hope of succeeding.
   ICN said it sold its stake for $153,300 per share, or a total of
$209 million.
   The company declined to say whether it had shown a gain or loss
on the stock, adding that the information would be released with
results of its first quarter ended Feb. 29.
   As of the end of its fiscal year on Nov. 30, the company had
paid $169.8 million for a 6.3 percent stake. La Roche has about
16,000 shares outstanding.
   Separately, ICN said that in its first-quarter results, it would
reverse $15.9 million of the $19.4 million in unrealized losses it
posted at the year's end. Most of those losses were atrributable to
the company's government and corporate bond holdings.
   ICN's major product is ribavirin, an antiviral drug that has
been approved in 28 countries thorughout the world for a variety of
viral infections, including influenza, hepatitis B and herpes
simplex.

film-distribution offices, eliminating 28 jobs, or about 15 percent
of its 200 workers.
   Among the movies that performed poorly at the box office for DEG
were ``Taipan,'' ``Million Dollar Mystery,'' ``Weeds'' and ``Date
With an Angel.''
   The company said Thursday its future sales would be handled out
of its corporate office but that the company would ``continue to
explore various distribution alternatives.''
   Those alternatives could include contracting with another film
company to handle De Laurentiis' production.
   Currently, De Laurentiis has seven films, most of them completed
except for various amounts of post-production work. That is down
from nine films in 1987.
   The distribution offices to be closed are in Los Angeles,
Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta and New York.
   ``While this news may seem discouraging, in reality the closing
of our branches is in line with our restructuring plans,'' said
Laurence Gleason, president of the company's marketing and
distribution unit.
   The company's restructuring speeded up substantially after its
founder, Dino De Laurentiis, stepped down in February as chairman
and chief executive.
   In mid-March, the firm sold foreign television, video and
non-theatrical rights to virtually its entire 320-movie film
library for $69 million. It is still seeking a burying for the
remaining rights to its library and for the Wilmington, N.C.,
studio where most of its films have been made.

<HEAD>Griffin Seeks Talks With Trump in Resorts Fight; SEC Begins Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Merv Griffin's investment company
says it is seeking to meet with rival bidder Donald Trump in their
battle over hotel-casino operator Resorts International Inc.
   But Griffin at this time has no plans to further increase his
$295 million offer, spokesman Mark Gill said Thursday.
   Griffin and an attorney for Trump also disclosed separately that
the Securities and Exchange Commission has begun looking into
alleged violations of securities law in the Resorts fight.
   In another development, Griffin announced that the largest
holder of Resorts' Class A common stock had withdrawn its support
for Trump's $22-a-share offer and asked a Delaware court to reject
it.
   The court must act on the offer because it was made as part of a
proposed settlement of shareholder suits alleging that Trump's
initial offer of $15 a share undervalued the company.
   Trump attorney Pamela Tikellis disclosed the SEC investigation
in a letter to the Delaware court, linking it to ``very substantial
gyrations in the marketplace'' for Resorts stock.
   It attributed those stock price movements to statements by
Griffin and an ally that ``have had a manipulative effect.''
   Griffin also acknowledged that the SEC had begun gathering
information in the probe but indicated that it was limited to
allegations of violations by Trump, including the failure to
promptly disclose a new and higher appraisal for Resorts properties
in making his $22-a-share offer.
   Griffin last week made an offer of $35 a share, or $225 million,
for all of the company's stock _ its 5.7 million Class A shares,
which carry one vote each, and its 752,000 Class B shares, which
carry 100 votes each.
   Trump owns 95 percent of the Class B stock, giving him control
over 88 percent of the company's voting strength.
   This week, Griffin boosted his offer to $295 million. Except for
a proviso that Class A shareholders receive an unspecified premium
over the $35 offer, Resorts' directors would be able to apportion
the $70 million increase as they see fit. That was widely seen as a
vehicle to shunt most of the money to Trump.
   ``We are prepared to sit down with Mr. Trump and the Resorts
board to discuss obtaining a superior bid for the public
stockholders and to satisfy the needs of all parties,'' said
Michael Nigris, the president of Griffin Co.
   Griffin spokesman Gill said the allusion to a ``superior bid''
referred to one that is better than the $22-a-share bid that Trump
has made. Gill said Griffin has no plans at this time to again
increase his offer.
   Trump has repeatedly said he would not sell his stock _ a
condition required by the Griffin bid. Attorney Steve Gartner,
representing Trump, said Thursday that the New York-based developer
hasn't changed that stance.
   As a result of Trump's objection, Resorts' board has twice
refused to pursue the offer on grounds it is moot.
   The shareholder who defected from the settlement agreement with
Trump was the investment firm of Tweedy, Browne Co., which owns 8.6
percent of Resorts' Class A stock.
   Trump, based in Atlantic City, N.J., has hotel-casino operations
in New Jersey and the Bahamas.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co.'s non-automotive subsidiaries
together earned a $62 million profit in 1987, their first
money-making year since 1979, the No. 2 automaker said in its
annual report.
   The businesses, which include Rouge Steel Corp., the only steel
company owned by a U.S. automaker, and Ford Aerospace Corp., have
been the focus of major efforts to restore profitability rather
than sell.
   The 1987 profit was a strong improvement over 1986's $205
million loss, but still well short of 1979's $181 million profit,
Ford said.
   Although Ford doesn't disclose results for the individual
companies, the biggest loser is believed to be Rouge Steel, which
Ford once tried to sell to a Japanese steel company.
   Instead, Ford opted to modernize Rouge Steel and other
non-automotive and supplier businesses. This year, it will spend
more than $100 million on Rouge Steel alone.
   The biggest winner was Ford Aerospace, which won three major
government space station contracts worth more than $400 million,
Ford said.
   Ford also said it plans to build a $100 million electronics
plant in Lansdale, Pa., to replace an existing plant and keep 2,400
jobs.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Steady To Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened steady to
mixed today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans opened off more than a penny a bushel due to fairly
heavy farmer selling after Thursday's sharp gains, analysts said.
But prices came back quickly and were narrowly mixed within minutes
of the opening bell.
   Soybean prices also were pressured by ideas that the threat of
weather damage to the nearly ripe South American soybean crop has
passed, said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``You haven't had moisture there since mid-February,'' Loewy
said. ``But the perception in the market is that whatever damage
will be done to the crop by the hot, dry weather has already been
done.''
   He said wheat futures were slightly lower due to slackening
export demand; corn was slightly higher on a lack of farmer selling.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.06 a bushel; corn was \ cent to
1 cent higher with May at $2.07} a bushel; oats were } cent lower
to { cent higher with May at $1.69 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents
lower to 1 cent higher with May at $6.49 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .23 cent higher with April at 74.60
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher
with March at 82.45 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .50 cent
higher with April at 46.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.15 cent to .32 cent higher with May at 57.00 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Thursday; pork futures
were mostly higher.

   Bidding has escalated for J.P. Stevens & Co.
Inc., with rival textile maker West Point-Pepperell Inc. raising
its buyout offer in an attempt to thwart the takeover agreement
Stevens already has made with an investment group.
   West Point-Pepperell offered to pay $62.50 for each of Stevens'
17.8 million shares outstanding, a total of about $1.1 billion, and
indicated it was willing to go higher in a negotiated deal.
   West Point-Pepperell's new offer topped a bid Stevens already
accepted from an investment group as well as West Point-Pepperell's
own earlier bid. Stevens agreed last week to accept a
$61.50-a-share buyout offer from the New York investment group
Odyssey Partners.
   The tender offer will expire at midnight EST on April 21, West
Point-Pepperell announced today. The company also said it has filed
suit in a Delaware court against Stevens and Odyssey, charging
Stevens' board of directors with breach of their duty to
shareholders in signing an ``unlawful'' merger agreement with
Odyssey.
   Stevens stock rose 50 cents to $63.50 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange Thursday. West Point-Pepperell dropped $1.50 a share
to $33.12{.
   Stevens does not plan to respond to West Point-Pepperell's new
offer ``until we have some information on which to base a
response,'' said Stevens spokesman Jim Franklin.
   Franklin said some Stevens shareholders had sued the company for
rejecting West Point-Pepperell's earlier cash buyout offer of $56 a
share, or about $867 million, but declined to elaborate.
   Eager to capture Stevens as part of an ambitious expansion plan,
West Point-Pepperell said it would raise its latest offer to $64 a
share if Stevens accepted its proposal and signed a definitive
merger agreement by April 5. The merger agreement would have to be
similar to the accord that Stevens signed with Odyssey, West
Point-Pepperell said.
   Odyssey's offer is subject to a majority of the shares being
tendered and the necessary financing being obtained.
   ``We've been absolutely frustrated by the (Stevens) board,''
West Point-Pepperell Chairman Joseph L. Lanier said in a telephone
interview. He said his company was willing to sweeten its bid to
$64 a share ``if the board would only cooperate with us.''
   Asked whether West Point-Pepperell would consider raising its
offer above the conditional $64 a share, Lanier said, ``I wouldn't
preclude it.''
   West Point-Pepperell also sought to soothe potential antitrust
concerns raised by a possible merger of the two textile giants. The
company said that if it acquired Stevens, it would sell half of
Stevens' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines for about
$170 million. West Point-Pepperell said it has signed a definitive
agreement for the sale with NTC Group, parent of Bidd Co., a
textile manufacturer.
   The comapny also said NTC had an option to acquire Stevens'
automotive and residential carpeting business for $120 million.
   Bidding for Stevens began shortly after it fielded a leveraged
buyout offer several weeks ago from a group led by its own senior
management, including Chairman Whitney Stevens _ a fifth-generation
member of the family that founded the company in 1813.
   The management group initially offered $43 a share and later
sweetened its bid to $55 a share in cash and securities. In a
leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed money
repaid with a target company's profits or the sale of assets.
   West Point-Pepperell has indicated previously that an
acquisition of Stevens would fit with its strategy of focusing on
consumer products.
   West Point-Pepperell's brands include Arrow, Martex, Lady
Pepperell and Burberrys.
   Stevens, one of the nation's biggest textile makers, produces
home fashion textiles such as sheets, towels and carpets under the
brand names Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley and Pierre Cardin. The
company also makes automotive and industrial products.

<HEAD>Is It a Bull, a Bear Or an Ostrich?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bull charges with a ferocious, head-down
gallop that spikes victims and flings them in the air. A bear
attacks by clawing and stomping enemies into the ground.
   The beasts evolved into the symbols for good times and bad in
the stock market, the bull for charging forward in a buying spree
and the bear for selling at any excuse. They are ingrained in the
securities vocabulary.
   But amid one of Wall Street's most uncertain times, questions
are arising over these terms. Some analysts say the market's
erratic behavior since the October crash suggests it might be time
to scrap the conventional animal analogies in favor of others.
   ``I would rather have eagles and groundhogs,'' said Philip C.
Puccio, manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co. in
New York. ``But seriously, how about ostrich? The market is wearing
blinders to what the economic problems are out there, hiding its
head in the sand.''
   Robert Sobel, a Hofstra University professor and financial
author who has written extensively about the stock market, says he
believes the October break was an aberration in the bull market
that began in 1982.
   Now that the market is neither bullish or bearish, he says, ``I
call it a horse market. Just horsing around.''
   Most strategists who routinely use bullish or bearish to
describe the outlook don't know the origin of the terms. Historians
never have documented precisely who invented them.
   ``Throughout my travels I've never seen anything that says,
`Aha, this is where it came from,''' said Yale Hirsch, a veteran
analyst who publishes the Stock Trader's Almanac. ``I've looked
constantly, and nobody seems to know.''
   A common hypothesis is that the symbols evolved during the 1800s
in England, Sobel says.
   ``The theory most people seem to accept is that a bull, when it
goes after you, tries to push you on its horns and lift you up,''
Sobel observed. ``The bear crushes you down.''
   James Medbery, a 19th century stockbroker who wrote a work
titled ``Men and Mysteries of Wall Street,'' was one of the first
to explain the terms in print. If you bought stock cheaply for
future delivery in the hope prices would rise, you were a bull, he
wrote. If you sold stock for future delivery in the hope prices
would fall, you were a bear.
   The official history book of the New York Stock Exchange
suggests the analogy's roots may date back earlier to the proverb,
``To sell the bear's skin before one has caught the bear.''
   The book also mentions natural history as a possible
explanation. ``If a bear finds anything, whether it be a turkey on
a roost or a man on a tree, he lifts its paw and pulls it down,''
it explains. ``The bull, on the contrary, lowers its head only to
give men and things a decided upward tendency.''
   The NYSE helped institutionalize the bull and bear analogies
early this century, when it commissioned a sculpture depicting the
beasts locked in combat, with neither taking the advantage. Merrill
Lynch & Co., one of the country's biggest investment houses, uses
the bull on its logo.
   Animal behaviorists say that generally, the bull and bear
analogies to the stock market are appropriate.
   ``Bears are pretty tough animals,'' said Frederick Sterling,
manager of animal collections for the Bronx Zoo. ``People take them
as being lethargic and easy-going. But if they're disturbed, for
whatever reason, they run you right down. It's like the 8:15 from
Connecticut coming into Grand Central.''
   Lowell L. Wilson, professor of animal science at Pennsylvania
State University, says bulls can have unpredictable behavior
patterns but usually are territorial and ornery.
   ``That's probably one of the main reasons the analogy to the
stock market is made,'' Wilson said. ``On a practical basis though,
the bulls we use in the (husbandry) industry are selected for good
behavior. In other words, if somebody has an aggressive bull, it
probably winds up as hamburger.''

   Interest rates and bond prices were holding
steady in early trading today, following Thursday's volatile
session that ended on a mixed note.
   By midday, the Treasury's 30-year bond slipped 1-32 point, or
about 30 cents per $1,000 face amount, and yielded 8.72 percent,
unchanged from late Thursday.
   The bellwether issue had closed 1-32 point lower in the previous
session after losing as much as { point, or $5, earlier in the day.
   In the absence of any market-moving economic news, some bond
traders were looking at the currency and oil markets, often an
indicator on where inflation might be heading.
   A stable dollar was said to be adding a positive tone to
shorter-maturing securities while a slight increase in oil prices
has hurt some longer-maturing bonds a bit.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments and intermediate maturities were unchanged to 1-16
point higher while 20-year issues were down 1-32 point, according
to figures provided by Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.01 to 111.82. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood at
1,169.54, up 0.31.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were unchanged
in light trading, according to the investment firm of Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.63 to 281.73.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were down 3 basis points to
5.78 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills were unchanged at 6.03 percent and one-year bills
were off 2 basis points at 6.38 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6| percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Corp., in its quest for
Roper Corp., said today it will move to Michigan its legal battle
challenging the appliance and garden equipment maker's agreement to
be acquired by Whirlpool Corp.
   Separately, Roper said its board will meet next week to review
bids from GE and Whirlpool. GE increased its tender offer for Roper
on Monday to $507 million, topping Whirlpool's $470 million merger
agreement with Roper.
   The GE tender offer amounts to $54 a share; Whirlpool's tender
offer amounts to $50 a share for the Augusta, Ga.-based company.
   A federal judge here denied GE's request to move a lawsuit filed
by Whirlpool to Delaware, where GE filed two suits challenging the
Roper-Whirlpool combination.
   ``It was simply a matter of whether it would be consolidated in
Delaware or Michigan,'' GE spokesman George Jameson said.
   GE said today it will withdraw the federal court actions it
filed in Delaware in and refile them in the Kalamazoo court,
Jameson said from GE headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.
   ``Whirlpool will be inconvenienced by litigating in Delaware,
while GE will be inconvenienced by litigating in Michigan,'' U.S.
District Judge Richard A. Enslen said in a written order issued
Thursday.
   But in ordering the case to be heard in Michigan, Enslen noted
that many of the main witnesses are in Michigan.
   Whirlpool, headquartered in Benton Harbor, Mich., has not said
whether it will top GE's latest bid. ``We don't have a comment on
that at this point,'' spokeswoman Donna McLean said today.
   Analysts have said that merging with Roper would move Whirlpool
ahead of GE as the country's top appliance maker.
   Whirlpool's suit charged that GE's initial $45-a-share offer for
Roper, made on March 6, was an attempt to sabotage a
Whirlpool-Roper merger agreement announced in February in which
Whirlpool said it would pay $37.50 a share.
   Whirlpool later sweetened its bid to $50 a share, and Roper's
board recommended shareholders accept the offer.
   In its lawsuits, GE claimed both Whirlpool and Roper failed to
adequately disclose terms of their merger agreement under
Securities and Exchange Commission laws.
   The suit also claims Whirlpool and Roper failed to publicly
disclose GE's prior interest in acquiring Roper and accuses the
Roper board of concealing from shareholders that GE, as well as
Whirlpool, wanted to buy the company.

   Share prices closed lower Friday but finished well
above their worst levels of the day reached after the release of
disappointing British trade figures for February.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 14.8
points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,767.9.
   The index moved down as much as 23.3 points on the trade news
but then recovered gradually through the afternoon as trading
volume slackened considerably.
   Volume was light at 412.5 million shares, down from 535.3
million on Thursday.
   Shares traded narrowly in the morning but then plunged when the
government reported at 11:30 a.m. local time that Britain's
February merchandise trade deficit narrowed to 1.3 billion pounds,
about $2.4 billion, from 1.4 billion pounds in January.
   The current account deficit, which includes invisible trade like
financial services, narrowed to 720 million pounds, or $1.3
billion, from 844 million pounds, the Department of Trade and
Industry said.
   Despite the narrowings, both deficits were much larger than the
markets had expected.
   The sharp drop attracted a few bargain hunters. Share prices
recovered further on the back of markups by market makers after
Wall Street opened, apparently in no mood to reenact Thursday's
sharp sell-off. But afternoon trading volume slowed to a trickle
ahead of the weekend.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was 13.3 points lower at
1,408.3 at the close.
   The Financial Times 500-share index fell 9.35 points to close at
999.76.

<HEAD>Who Are Big `Muni' Buyers? Don't Look At Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uncle Sam has clearly broken up the cozy
relationship between the nation's commerical banks and the
municipal bond market.
   Historically one of the biggest players in that market, banks
have dumped more than $51 billion of their municipal bond holdings
in the last two years due to changes in the tax law, according to a
report by the Public Securities Association, a trade group of bond
dealers.
   The report, released this past week by the PSA and based on
Federal Reserve data, showed that individual investors were the
leading buyers of municipal bonds for the third consecutive year in
1987, either through the purchase of individual bonds, unit
investment trusts or tax-exempt mutual and money market funds.
   The report noted that households owned 39 percent of the $720.5
million outstanding issues last year, up from 33.6 percent in 1986
and 36.5 percent in the previous year.
   Banks came in second with a 25 percent holding, down from 29
percent in 1986 and 35.1 percent in 1985. Their holdings peaked in
1971 with 51.2 percent. Property and casualty insurance companies
owned 13.1 percent; mutual funds, 9.8 percent; and money market
funds, 8.5 percent.
   The dramatic decline in bank holdings came as a result of the
1986 Tax Reform Act, which removed incentives for bank portfolios
to invest in municipal bonds, or ``munis'' as they're known on Wall
Street.
   Banks had been able to deduct from their income taxes 80 percent
of the cost of holding these tax-exempt bonds, but the tax law
eliminated the deduction except on state and local issues totaling
$10 million or less a year. The changes have had a mixed effect on
the market so far, analysts and traders said.
   ``From an issuers point of view ... you're entering the market
realizing that except in very unusual circumstances banks won't be
one of your purchasers, so you're heavily dependent on individual
purchases who face an entirely different set of incentives than do
banks,'' said PSA President Heather Ruth.
   In the recent past, issuers and banks have had a cozy
relationship. As an example, Ruth notes that around tax time when
some individual investors sold bonds to raise cash to pay their
taxes, banks would eagerly snap them up, keeping prices and yields
stable.
   George Friedlander, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co., says it's not surprising that since the tax law most
smaller issues have been doing better than the bigger ones which
dominate the market.
   Because banks are still actively buying them, bonds from the
smallest of issues are more liquid, meaning they could be traded in
a short period of time with relatively small price fluctuations,
Friedlander said.
   That price stability means lower yields, reducing borrowing
expenses for the small issuers but raising them for the bigger ones.
   Analysts note that volatility in the muni market is likely to
continue through 1989, when insurance companies will see their tax
incentives wiped out as a result of the overhaul of the tax system.

<HEAD>CFTC Approves Moving Limits On S&P 500 Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said Friday it
would impose an unusual system of adjustable price limits on its
Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures to reduce the volatility
of U.S. financial markets.
   The limits were approved Thursday by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and take effect Monday, replacing the 30-point
price limit the Chicago Merc placed on S&P 500 futures in the wake
of the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   The new limits will range from 15 index points to 25 index
points depending on the settlement price of the lead-month S&P 500
futures contract on the last business day of the preceding month,
the exchange said in a statement to its members.
   Price limits effectively halt trading of a futures contract
whenever the price of the contract moves above or below the
specified amount.
   Investors use stock-index futures to hedge against losses in the
stock market by betting on the price movement of the stocks that
make up the index.
   S&P 500 futures account for more than 80 percent of all U.S.
stock-index futures trades.
   Chicago Merc officials have said the limits will result in
better coordination of U.S. financial markets, a key recommendation
of the presidential commission that investigated the stock market
crash.
   A one-point move in the S&P 500 index is roughly equivalent to
an eight-point move in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials.
Some analysts had criticized the 30-point limit on S&P 500 futures
_ equivalent to about 240 points on the Dow _ as being too high to
curtail all but the most violent price swings.
   A 15-point limit will take effect Monday because the June
contract settled Feb. 29 at 268.75 points, within the low-end range
of 0 to 275 points.
   The limit would rise to 20 points if the June contract settled
above 275 points on the last trading day of March, or to 25 points
if the June contract closed above 325 points.
   The June contract settled at 264.10 points on Thursday.

   The stock market came under more selling
pressure today, extending Thursday's sharp drop.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 43.77 on Thursday,
dropped 23.70 to 2,000.17 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 434 up, 969

   After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed
signs of steadying today.
   Interest rates, which had contributed to the stock market's woes
by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a bit.
   But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks. They
said Thursday's selloff dealt a significant blow to the tenuous
confidence that had been building up in the market's rally since
late last year.
   That left the focus of activity on numerous stocks involved in
takeover news and speculation.
   Gillette jumped 4[ to 48[ amid widespread but unconfirmed rumors

<HEAD>Most Companies Relocate Close to Home, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most companies stay close to home when they
relocate their headquarters, according to a national survey to be
released Monday.
   The survey published by Cushman & Wakefield Inc., a business
real estate firm based in New York, showed that 85 percent of the
companies that relocated their headquarters during the past five
years moved to a similar type of location, while 62 percent
relocated in the same community.
   Only 7 percent of the relocating companies changed states, the
survey indicated.
   The findings are based on interviews with top executives at 400
organizations, including publicly and privately held corporations,
partnerships, non-profit companies and government agencies. All the
organizations polled have 50 or more employees at their
headquarters and have relocated in the past five years.
   While the suburbs of large cities rank first as a preferred
location for head offices with 36 percent, the survey also
suggested a growing tendency for relocating in the biggest U.S.
cities, Cushman & Wakefield said. The survey showed that 28 percent
of the relocating companies consider big cities the best type of
location.
   ``The survey disputes the widespread impression of a sudden wave
of headquarters relocations and a mass exodus from the nation's
largest cities,'' said Arthur J. Mirante, president and chief
executive officer of the real estate company.
   ``Only a handful of organizations relocate across state lines,''
Mirante added.
   He said such moves recently as Mobil Corp.'s from New York to
Fairfax, Va., and Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.'s from Akron, Ohio,
to Chicago are the exceptions rather than the rule.
   The need for more space was the most compelling reason for
relocating, according to the survey.
   Other reasons were a more favorable company image, lower
occupancy costs, a better quality of life for employees, better
access to markets, customers or clients, and a major change in the
company's strategic direction. None of those factors, however, were
considered crucial by more than 24 percent, the survey showed.

<HEAD>Trillions of Dollars Up for Grabs as Savings System Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than $2 trillion in Japanese savings accounts
loses its tax-free status next week, and executives from Tokyo
investment firms to foreign manufacturers are dreaming of tapping
into the treasure trove.
   The April 1 change was prompted by complaints from allies that
Japan needs to spur domestic consumption as a way to recycle some
of its $82.7 billion annual trade surplus.
   The hope is the new 20 percent tax on interest will encourage
Japanese to save less and spend more. But many experts do not
foresee that happening.
   The system of tax-free individual accounts _ known as ``maryu''
_ was set up after World War II to provide a reserve of capital to
finance the rebuilding of Japan's economy. Through it, the average
Japanese family had built a nest egg worth the equivalent of
$82,000 by last year.
   George Nemo, a broker for the investment firm Vickers Da Costa
in Tokyo, estimates such accounts now hold a total of 300 trillion
yen _ or about $2.3 trillion.
   Banks are touting new savings plans to hold onto this treasure,
while securities companies are trying to lure it away. Foreign
countries hope to get part of it through increased sales of exports
to Japan.
   But despite the advertising hoopla, Nemo and other financial
analysts expect much of the money to remain right where it is for
now.
   ``This is not as spectacular as one might expect,'' Nemo said.
   He said recent surveys of Japanese housewives, who handle most
of the money in the average Japanese family, found they would be
willing to pay the new tax and ``leave their nest eggs alone.''
   However, he said there is bound to be at least a small
percentage unwilling to settle for the low interest that banks pay
on such accounts. Some of that money will find new homes, most
probably in Japan's booming stock market.
   Banks pay only four-tenths of 1 percent interest on a regular
savings account and up to about 4 percent for long-term deposits.
   Under the maryu system, no tax was charged for interest on
savings accounts of up to $47,500, postal savings accounts of
$23,800 and installment savings of $4,000. In addition, workers
were allowed to build tax-free savings accounts of $40,000 through
their employers.
   The Japanese are among the industrialized world's biggest
savers. The average family in Japan saves 16.1 percent of its
annual income, compared with 11.6 percent for West Germany, 10.1
percent for France, 7.8 percent for Britain and 6.6 percent in the
United States.
   Nemo is doubtful the next tax will have much effect on saving.
   ``The problem is, they already have just about all the
televisions, videos, and smart clothes they could want,'' he said.
``And if they can't afford to buy homes, where are they going to
spend the money?''
   According to the Economic Planning Agency, 99 percent of the
Japanese own a color television set, refrigerator and washing
machine, 98 percent own a vacuum cleaner and nearly 70 percent own
a car.
   With the high housing and land prices, most Japanese can never
hope to own their own home, so there is little else to do with the
money other than spend it on high-priced cars or travel, invest it
in the stock market or put it in a savings account.
   Takasuke Koneko, a spokesman for Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said
Japanese are very cautious about where they put their savings
because the burden of providing for old age falls on the individual
in Japan. He predicted many people would be scared off stock
investing because of the worldwide plunge in stock prices last
October.
   Koneko said some of the money probably will go to life
insurance, which is still tax-free if a person signs a contract for
more than five years. However, he said, many people will not be
willing to wait that long for a return on their investment.
   ``The bottom line is that we have to protect ourselves,'' he
said. ``We cannot shift our funds. Still, we will have to save. In
20 years, when we get ready to retire, the stock market could be
two or three times what it could be now, but it could also be
one-half or one-third.
   ``Even with the end of the maryu system, our money has to be
kept where it is safe.''

   Corn futures prices closed higher while wheat and
soybeans finished slightly lower Friday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Corn turned in the best performance but most of the buying was
speculative in the absence of fresh fundamental news, an analyst
said.
   Soybeans retreated in line with soybean meal. The soybean
complex also was pressured by ideas that the threat of weather
damage to the nearly ripe South American soybean crop has passed,
said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``I just don't think any more crop damage can be done,'' he said.
   Losses in wheat futures were underpinned by the Agriculture
Department's sale Thursday of 7.2 million bushels of surplus wheat,
an unusally large figure for the thrice-weekly auctions in the face
of slackening export demand, Loewy said.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.05 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents

<TEXT>
   The arrival of spring has brought signs of
recovery to the toy industry following 1987's dismal performance.
Stores are selling more toys and manufacturers are getting more
orders.
   But toymakers know the fickle tastes of young customers can take
a promising product and overnight turn it into a dud. So there is
an air of caution in this highly volatile business, although the
early trend is positive.
   ``It's a very good retail environment for the first time in
several years,'' said Paul Valentine, a toy industry analyst with
Standard & Poor's Corp.
   At Toys R Us Inc., the nation's largest toy store chain,
President Norman Ricken said more customers are in the stores and
sales are up ``quite strongly'' over last year.
   ``The indications are that it's a better start for the year than
most people anticipated,'' said Spencer Boise, a spokesman for
Mattel Inc., the nation's second-largest toymaker.
   Good consumer demand usually translates into more orders for
manufacturers, and that has heartened the big toy companies, most
of whom finished 1987 in the red because product lines failed,
sales fell off and costs were too high.
   Toys that were big sellers at Christmas have remained popular in
1988. Among them are Nintendo and other video games, Games Gang
Ltd.'s Pictionary board game, Fisher Price's Fun With Food, Kenner
Parker Toys' Real Ghostbusters action game and Matchbox Toys Ltd.'s
Pee Wee Herman talking doll.
   The popularity of such products _ known as carryover toys in the
business _ contrasts with the events of a year ago, when toys that
had been best sellers at Christmas 1986 fizzled.
   Another positive sign is that the success of the current
best-sellers is becoming contagious.
   ``They spark people to come into the store, and they buy other
things,'' Ricken of Toys R Us said. ``There is a lot of impulse
buying.''
   Rick Anguilla, editor of the trade publication Toy & Hobby
World, agreed, saying, ``The key is, bring people into the stores.''
   Several years ago, Coleco's Trivial Pursuit and Cabbage Patch
Kids were luring consumers in droves, but Pictionary and Nintendo
are today's top draws, Anguilla said.
   But despite the early trends, manufacturers and the people who
track their fortunes are taking a wait-and-see approach for the
remainder of 1988.
   ``It's a little too early to predict a strong year,'' said
Anguilla.
   Mattel's orders are running ahead of the company's conservative
expectations, but Boise warned, ``Orders are not necessarily a good
indication of how the year might go, because they're cancelable
anytime up to delivery.''
   The analysts also caution that after the disappointments of
1987, it's easy to show for companies to show an improvement in
sales.
   ``They're just going from a disaster to a more normal operating
environment,'' said Harold Vogel, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &
Co.
   ``I think they are doing better, but I don't see anything great
happening,'' he said.
   Caution also was the watchword when the industry unveiled its
new products last month at its annual trade show, Toy Fair.
   Burned by the failure of lines such as expensive high-tech
dolls, companies showed fewer new toys and leaned toward smaller,
less expensive ideas. The early returns indicate the strategy is
working.
   Tonka Corp. is getting strong orders for Starting Lineup, a
series of sports figures intended to sell under $5 apiece, said
Robert Meek, a company spokesman.
   Tonka's orders are well above 1987 levels, Meek said. The
company markets a top-selling video game, Sega, but all of its
divisions are showing improvement, he said.
   Industry watchers say another company doing much better is Lewis
Galoob Toys Inc.'s. Galoob, which lost money on high-tech items in
1987, is focusing on less risky ideas such as plastic charms that
contain cosmetics and stationery for girls, tiny dolls and small,
transformable military figures for boys.
   Companies, some of which have laid off workers, also continue to
look for ways to cut expenses. On Friday, Tonka announced a
restructuring in its Canadian operations, including 60 layoffs.
   Such moves will help a company's bottom line, and form a hedge
against heavy losses should sales drop off again.
   Vogel predicted for the toymakers this year, ``They'll have some
modest profits, but no one's setting the world on fire.''

<TEXT>
   Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, former Saudi Arabian oil
minister, lost his Appeal Court bid Friday for a temporary
injunction against Monday's official publication of the book
``Yamani: The Inside Story.''
   Yamani applied for a temporary order blocking Simon and
Schuster's release of the book by American author Jeffrey Robinson
pending a full hearing next week.
   The book is also scheduled to be serialized in the Sunday
Express, a London newspaper, this weekend.
   The judge, Lord Donaldson, said a full hearing could not be
scheduled until Wednesday. He said it was regrettable when the
courts could not act fast enough to ``preserve the rights of the
parties,'' but said Yamani should have started court proceedings
sooner.
   Yamani claimed the author reneged on undertakings not to refer
in the book to the Saudi royal family or to the reasons behind his
dismissal from the government.
   Pre-publication copies of the book have already been offered for
sale in London.

   The Treasury Department auctioned off $4.06
billion in short-term bills on Friday with an average yield of 6.20
percent.
   The so-called cash management bill will mature in 22 days and
was issued so the government would have enough money on hand to
make tax refund payments during the tax filing season.
   The last time the government had to resort to such short-term
financing was during last year's tax filing season when a 20-day
bill had an average yield of 5.75 percent.
   The discount rate understates the actual return to investors _
6.31 percent with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,962.10. A total of
$38.81 billion in bids were received.

   The stock market took a sharp drop for the
second straight session today, closing out its worst week so far in
1988.
   After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed
signs of steadying today.
   Interest rates, which had contributed to the stock market's woes
by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a bit.
   But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks. They
said Thursday's selloff dealt a significant blow to the tenuous
confidence that had been building up in the market's rally since
late last year.
   About the only stocks attracting any buying interest were issues
involved in takeover news and speculation.

<HEAD>Trade Delegation Signs Contracts For About 10 Million Bushels Of
Corn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South Korean trade delegation signed
contracts in Iowa on Friday to purchase about 10 million bushels of
U.S. corn for about $29.3 million, and an official said about 95
percent of his country's corn purchases this year would be from the
United States.
   That would mark a continued rebound of U.S. shipments, which in
1985 accounted for just 36 percent of the corn purchased by South
Korea, according to the Iowa Corn Promotion Board.
   The drop in U.S. corn sales mainly reflected an aggressive
export drive by China earlier this decade to compete for a growing
share of world sales, said economist Robert Wisner at Iowa State
University.
   He said the resurgence of corn sales to South Korea by the
United States is a result of reduced Chinese sales because of
growing domestic consumption.
   South Korea, meantime, is stepping up imports of feed grains as
it expands its livestock industry, and has increased corn
consumption from 3 million metric tons in 1985 to about 5 million
metric tons this year, said Chan-Kung Park, head of the trade
mission and chairman of the Korea Feed Association.
   The delegation signed contracts Friday to buy 150,000 metric
tons, or about 6 million bushels of corn, from Continental Grain
and to buy another 50,000 metric tons, or about 2 million bushels,
each from Cargill Inc. and Marc Rich Co. A metric ton is
approximately 2,205 pounds.
   After subtracting the cost of transporting the grain to Asia,
South Korea paid an average of about $1.85 a bushel for the grain,
according to the Iowa Corn Promotion Board.
   Those purchases, when added to contracts signed in neighboring
Nebraska and South Dakota, brought sales to the trade mission to
550,000 metric tons.
   Park said that so far this year, South Korea had bought more
than 2.25 million metric tons of U.S. corn and that most of the
remainder of its 1988 purchases would be from the United States. He
estimated the U.S. would account for 95 percent of the corn bought
by his country in 1988.
   ``Korea is purchasing as much as possible from the United
States,'' Park said through an interpreter. He said that with the
decline in the U.S. dollar in the past three years, U.S. corn is
priced competitively on world markets with grain from China and
other Asian sources and he said U.S. agricultural policy has been
very successful since 1984.
   In the early 1980s, South Korea also bought more than 90 percent
of its corn from the United States, before China became a major
competitor.
   Iowa is the nation's leading corn producing state.

<HEAD>Pickens, Eastern Unions Reportedly Consider Texas Air Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Texas Air Corp. on Friday declined
comment on press reports that investor T. Boone Pickens is
considering helping unions acquire the company.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in Friday's editions that
Pickens met recently with representatives of Eastern Airlines'
unions to propose a plan to take over Texas Air, the parent of
Miami-based Eastern.
   Texas Air, based in Houston, is the nation's largest airline
holding company with about 20 percent of the U.S. market.
   Pickens laid out one strategy whereby his personal investment
company, Boone Co., would assist the unions in seeking a
controlling interest in Texas Air, the newspaper reported.
   ``The longstanding policy of the company is never to comment on
rumor or speculation,'' Texas Air spokesman Bruce Hicks said Friday.
   Pickens' spokesman, David Batchelder, reached by telephone in
Amarillo, Texas, also declined comment.
   Under Pickens' plan, about $1 billion of Eastern employees'
pension fund money would be used as leverage to fund an offer for
the company, the newspaper said.
   Under the arrangement, the unions would negotiate wage
concessions in return for a financial stake in the company, the
Journal said. If the plan succeeded, Pickens would receive a fee,
and would not participate in the management of the company, the
newspaper reported.
   Texas Air has about $5 billion in long-term debt, and Chairman
Frank Lorenzo has control of the company's voting power.
   Lorenzo and a few close associates own a special class of stock
which carries voting rights 10 times those of regular common stock.
   Unidentified participants in the recent discussions between
Pickens and Eastern's unions told the Journal they believed between
75 percent and 80 percent of Eastern's common shares would have to
be tendered in order to dilute Lorenzo's voting control to a
minority position.

<HEAD>Campeau Says It Won't Raise Its Federated Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. says it will not raise its $6.53
billion tender offer for Federated Department Stores Inc., but is
demanding a fair opportunity to compete with R.H. Macy & Co. Inc.
to buy the retailer, Federated said in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   ``Campeau is not increasing its price,'' Federated quoted
Campeau as saying in a statement to Federated's board Thursday.
``It believes its price is already too high.''
   ``This does not mean that you can give Macy's a chance to jigger
its bid or take any other action with respect to Macy's, without
giving Campeau a fair opportunity to respond,'' Federated quoted
Campeau as saying.
   The Federated filing was made public Friday.
   The Cincinnati-based Federated, operator of more than 650 stores
nationwide with total 1987 sales of $11.1 billion, said Thursday it
would discuss Campeau's tender offer with the Toronto-based
developer and talk with Macy about a possible sweetening of Macy's
$6.3 billion bid.
   Federated management has already approved a merger agreement
with Macy.
   Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, said its board
would meet by Wednesday, and Macy Chairman Edward Finkelstein and
his counterpart at Campeau, Robert Campeau, both would be allowed
to speak at the session.
   Federated said there is no guarantee the negotiations with Macy
will result in an improved offer.
   Campeau on Tuesday raised its two-step, all-cash offer for
Federated to an aggregate of approximately $73 a share from $68 a
share, or $6.18 billion. Under the new offer, Campeau said it would
pay $82 each for 70.5 million Federated shares and $37 for the
remainder of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares in a
subsequent merger.
   Campeau also extended the expiration of its offer to midnight
EST April 4, when Macy's offer is scheduled to expire.
   Campeau also proposed to Federated's board an alternate friendly
merger under which it would pay $73 a share for 70.5 million shares
in a tender offer and $73 for the remaining shares following the
merger.
   Campeau has proposed that a Campeau-Federated merger be
structured along lines similar to a merger agreement between the
retailer and Macy.
   Macy is offering $77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million
Federated shares, for a total of $5.4 billion. Macy would exchange
shares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securities
for the remainder of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares.
   Analysts value the Macy offer at $6.3 billion.
   Federated's divisions include Bloomingdale's, Abraham and
Straus, Burdine's, Filene's, Foley's, Lazarus and Rich's department
stores; Ralphs supermarkets; Gold Circle discount stores; and Main
Street and Children's Place specialty stores.
   Federated also has delayed putting into effect, until at least
March 30, a ``poison pill'' amendment to the company's shareholder
rights plan that allows shareholders to buy new shares at a steep
discount. It is designed to make an unwanted takeover more
expensive.
   It is not clear if Federated could apply the pill to Campeau but
not to Macy. Some analysts believe the outcome of the takeover
fight may turn on that issue, and that a court might ultimately
decide whether Federated can take such a step.

<HEAD>Subsidized Wheat Sales of 475,000 Tons to Soviets Get Green Light</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federally subsidized sales of 475,000 metric
tons of hard red winter wheat to the Soviet Union have been
indicated by five private exporters, the Agriculture Department
announced Friday.
   The Foreign Agriculture Service said in a statement that the
government-owned Commodity Credit Corp. had agreed to pay in-kind
bonuses to the exporters at an average value of $21.95 a ton to
ship the wheat to the Soviets in May.
   The subsidy payments were being made under the Export
Enhancement Program, which provides grain companies and others with
government-owned crops as bonuses to stimulate overseas sales of
American commodities.
   Since last April, total subsidized sales of wheat to the Soviets
have totaled amore than 10.8 million tons.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager of the Foreign
Agricultural Service, identified those receiving the bonuses and
the amounts of grain involved as Garnac Grain Company Inc., 50,000
tons; Richco Grain Ltd., 200,000 tons; Mitsubishi International
Corp., 25,000 tons; Artfer Inc., 50,000 and Louis Dreyfus Corp.,
150,000 tons.
   The sales left 525,000 tons still left for the Soviets to
purchase under a 2 million-ton offer made by the United States on
Jan. 29.
   The United States also made the Soviets an additional one
million-ton offer on Saturday.
   The two countries are preparing to negotiate a new long-term
grain agreement to replace the one that expires Sept. 30.
   It calls for the Soviets to buy 9 million metric tons a year of
which 4 million must be wheat and 4 million corn. The rest may then
purchasing the remainder in wheat, corn, soybeans or soybean meal,
with every ton of beans or meal counting as two tons of grain.
   Wheat sales to the Soviets slumped badly in 1986 despite the
agreement but picked up against last year as the United States gave
that country the green light for purchases under the subsidy
program.

<HEAD>Pickens' Top Deal Maker Resigns To Start Own Consulting Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMARILLO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Batchelder, who helped oilman T.
Boone Pickens Jr. make his corporate raids for the past decade,
said Friday he plans to leave the firm to start a consulting
business that may compete with Pickens.
   Batchelder, 38, said he will leave Mesa Limited Partnership at
the end of May to move to San Diego.
   ``It was really more of a case of leaving Amarillo than leaving
Boone,'' said Batchelder.
   ``Ten years in Amarillo is enough,'' Batchelder said. ``It's a
significant sacrifice to live in Amarillo,'' which he likened to
``a large truck stop.''
   He said he told Pickens last year that he would be leaving.
   ``My third child _ my son, Gary _ is graduating from high school
in May,'' he said. ``And I told Boone nine months ago, when that
happens, I would be leaving.'' He said Pickens said that he ``hated
to see a great team split up, but he understood.''
   Batchelder, who helped Pickens launch takover attempts against
Phillips Petroleum Co., Gulf Corp., Superior Oil Co., and Unocal
Corp., said he plans to offer other oil and gas interests his
experience through a private consulting firm.
   ``I think the expertise that I've developed through the years
with Mesa, I could take out now and advise others,'' Batchelder
said. ``I think I can generate some ideas that would be helpful to
other companies.''
   Batchelder refuted claims that his departure signals discontent
with Mesa's recent failed or aborted takeover efforts. In fact, he
said, he expected to be involved in more decisions with Pickens.
   ``I hope to do business with Boone and bring him some deals,''
he said. Still, he acknowledged he may be competing with Pickens
and Mesa on some ventures.
   ``Certainly the primary level for expertise I have is in the oil
and gas industry,'' Batchelder said. ``Mesa has recently branched
out into the gold industry and the aerospace space industry. But
petroleum has been a very profitable venture for Mesa and is still
very much a viable interest.''
   The Oklahoma native came to Pickens' firm from the Denver office
of the accounting firm Deloitte, Haskins & Sells, where he made
$30,000 a year as an audit manager. He began at Mesa as an
assistant to a vice president, but rose to the rank of comptroller
within two years and ultimately to the presidency of Mesa Petroleum
Co.
   When Mesa later became a limited partnership, Batchelder began
as a consultant.
   Batchelder said he believed Mesa would not suffer with his
departure.
   ``I think it will continue doing exactly what it's been doing,''
Batchelder said. ``We have a great team at Mesa. The other two
members of my team have been with me six years and seven years.
They'll go forward with the business.''
   Batchelder said he did not think he would be replaced at Mesa.
``I don't think they need to,'' he said. ``They are very
experienced.''

   Stock prices tumbled for the second straight
session Friday, closing out the market's worst week so far in 1988.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 44.92 points to
1,978.95, finishing the week with a net loss of 108.42.
   That marked the average's biggest weekly decline since it
dropped 143.74 points last Nov. 30-Dec. 4.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 in the
daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange, with 385 up, 1,156 down
and 428 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 163.17 million shares, against 184.91
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index lost
2.42 to 146.58.
   After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed
signs of steadying Friday. Interest rates, which had contributed to
the stock market's woes by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a
bit.
   But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks. They
said Thursday's selloff dealt a significant blow to the tenuous
confidence that had been building up in the market's rally since
late last year.
   In the absence of any news to explain the market's weakness,
brokers said many traders remained fearful that economic and
inflationary pressures might soon reach a point where they would
prompt the Federal Reserve to begin tightening credit.
   Since early February, when the NYSE set strictures on computer
program trading in the event of a 50-point move in the Dow, the
average has had five separate gains or losses of more than 40
points without ever activating the 50-point ``collar.''
   It rose 47.58 on Feb. 10; rose 48.41 on Feb. 29; fell 48.24 on
March 10, and then suffered back-to-back losses of 43.77 and 44.92
Thursday and Friday of this week.
   Point-plus losers among the blue chips Friday included
International Business Machines, down 2} at 107; General Electric,
down 1] at 40{; Exxon, down 1[ at 41|; Merck, down 2} at 161{, and
International Paper, down 1] at 41{.

   Avon Products, rumored as a possible buyout candidate, picked up
2| to 26~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $39.81 billion, or 1.52
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 189.25 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 5.78 to 299.53,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.84 at 258.51.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 3.06 to 372.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the market

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Tumble As Buying Interest Fades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices plunged more than $10 a troy ounce
Friday as the buying interest that had propelled prices sharply
higher earlier this week abruptly dried up.
   On other markets, gold and silver futures also retreated; crude
oil prices rose above $17 a barrel; stock-index futures fell
sharply; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; and grains
and soybeans were mixed.
   A five-day rally in the precious metals market skidded to a halt
after speculators tried and failed to push prices through key
resistance levels, analysts said.
   Platinum took the hardest hit, settling $10.10 to $10.80 lower
on the New York Mercantile Exchange with the contract for delivery
in April finishing at $503.10 a troy ounce.
   ``From what I understand there was just no interest in buying
it,'' said Jack Barbanel, director of futures trading for Gruntal &
Co. in New York. ``Usually the tendency is for the floor traders
and speculators to go into the weekend and take their profits.''
   Inflation fears linked to rising oil prices had supported the
precious metals through the week. But even Friday's solid gains in
oil prices could not keep the metals from slipping.
   On the New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $1.00 to
$1.20 lower with April at $453.30 a troy ounce; silver was 7 cents
to 7.4 cents lower with March at $6.665 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil rose above the psychologically important $17-a-barrel
mark for the first time since Feb. 11 on speculation that the
five-member pricing committee of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would take substantive action to stabilize
prices when it meets the first week in April, analysts said.
   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas
Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 12 cents higher with May
at $17.03 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent to .47 cent higher
with April at 47.78 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .53 cent
to .70 cent higher with April at 47.94 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures plunged for the second consecutive session,
mirroring sharp downward moves in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   The contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 6.35 points lower at 257.75 on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Analyst Bob Ray of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said trading
activity was mostly technically motivated.
   ``I think we're in the throes of a good correction,'' Ray said.
``It's very orderly, very methodical and not what I would call very
heavy volume, either.''
   Live cattle futures posted new contract highs for April and June
delivery on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the bullish mood
reflected higher cash prices increasing demand.
   The higher cash prices for beef parts ``suggest that retailers
are coming in fairly strong looking to get their needs ready for
after Easter,'' said Tom O'Hare, an analyst in New York with Smith

   ``They do a lot of hams before Easter, then the week before
Easter they start really getting interested in beef again,'' O'Hare
said.
   Pork futures prices advanced on higher cash prices and
indications of slackening supplies, O'Hare said.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .52 cent higher with April
at 74.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .52 cent
higher with March at 82.72 cents a pound; hogs were .18 cent to .67
cent higher with April at 46.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
werre .03 cent lower to .62 cent higher with May at 57.37 cents a
pound.
   Corn futures prices closed higher while wheat and soybeans
finished slightly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn turned in the best performance but most of the buying was
speculative in the absence of fresh fundamental news, an analyst
said.
   Soybeans retreated in line with soybean meal. The soybean
complex also was pressured by ideas that the threat of weather
damage to the nearly ripe South American soybean crop had passed,
said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Losses in wheat futures were underpinned by the Agriculture
Department's sale Thursday of 7.2 million bushels of surplus wheat,
an unusally large figure for the thrice-weekly auctions in the face
of slackening export demand, Loewy said.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 1} cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.05 a bushel; corn was 2} cents to 3} cents
higher with May at $2.09} a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent
higher with May at $1.68} a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents lower to

<HEAD>Adams Says Amendment Would Allow U.S. To Get Tough With Airbus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The omnibus trade bill pending in Congress
will include a provision allowing the United States to ``get
tough'' with a European airplane manufacturer which domestic
aerospace companies claim receives subsidies and engages in unfair
trading practices, a Washington State senator said Friday.
   Democratic Sen. Brock Adams said the provision, which he
authored, has been approved by House and Senate negotiators trying
to iron out final details of the trade bill.
   ``This amendment is designed to stop the international
consortium supporting Airbus Industrie from using unfair trading
practices in the United States,'' Adams said.
   Airbus, a consortium of aerospace companies in France, West
Germany, Britain, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, is the
world's second-largest manufacturer of commercial airplanes with
about 35 percent of the market.
   U.S. rival Boeing Co., based in Seattle, has between 55 percent
and 60 percent of the market.
   Adams said his amendment would expand coverage of existing
``countervailing duty laws'' to include countries such as those
supporting Airbus.
   At present, Adams said, U.S. companies can seek relief from
unfair trading practices when their competition is subsidized by
just one country, but not when the subsidies are coming from a
consortium of foreign countries.
   ``Boeing can sucessfully compete with Airbus, but not if Airbus
is not playing by the rules and getting huge subsidies from foreign
governments,'' Adams said.
   Airbus officials have consistently denied that the company was
receiving government subsidies or engaged in unfair trading
practices.
   The countervailing duty laws allow domestic manufacturers to ask
the U.S. government to impose a duty equal to the amount of foreign
subsidy for a product.
   ``Adoption of the amendment will help ensure a fair arena for
competition between Boeing and Airbus,'' Adams said.
   ``The adoption of this important amendment by Congress also
demonstrates once more for European governments the seriousness
with which their subsidies are viewed by the United States,'' said
L.W. Clarkson, a senior vice president of Boeing.

   Beazer PLC, unable to lure Koppers Co. into a
friendly deal, on Friday boosted its hostile tender offer for the
building materials and cement company to $1.7 billion.
   Government officials, meanwhile, lashed out at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. for assuming the unusual role of equity partner in the
takeover bid, but Shearson maintains it is merely acting as a
responsible investment banker to Beazer, a long-standing client.
   To protest Shearson's collaboration in the battle for
Pittsburgh-based Koppers, Pennsylvania officials said they have
terminated a $7-billion-a-year relationship with the New York
investment house, and one lawmaker has called for a congressional
investigation into Shearson's role.
   Koppers has rebuffed Beazer ever since it appeared on the scene
three weeks ago with a $45-a-share offer. Last weekend, Beazer
sweetened that bid to $56 a share, or $1.52 billion, which Koppers
characterized as inadequate.
   Before going directly to shareholders with its latest
$60-a-share tender offer, the British construction and building
materials company tried to negotiate a friendly deal at the same
price with Koppers management.
   In staunchly resisting the overtures, Koppers said it is
prepared to go deep into debt to finance a one-time cash payout to
its shareholders as a defensive maneuver. A consortium of banks has
agreed to lend Koppers about $1 billion to finance the payout.
   Beazer has threatened to sue Koppers if the company sells some
or all of its construction materials and services business as part
of a recapitalization plan.
   Separately, Koppers asked the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
to halt Beazer's tender offer because of antitrust considerations.
Beazer had agreed to sell Koppers' aggregate plant in Los Angeles
if the deal is consumated to satisfy the Justice Department's
antitrust concerns. Beazer called the Koppers move ``completely
without merit.''
   Koppers fell 12.5 cents to $58.625 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   At Koppers annual community business luncheon in Pittsburgh,
President Glen Tenley, a 33-year Koppers veteran, declared
management's intention to remain independent.
   ``Thirty-three years have not been spent with Koppers to be put
under some other company's ownership just because the dollar is
cheap and there are fat financial fees to be made,'' he said.
   In full-page advertisements appearing Friday in papers including
The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the Treasurer of
Pennsylvania criticized Shearson and its parent, American Express
Co., for their role in a hostile bid that ``can potentially have a
significant adverse impact on jobs in this state.''
   G. Davis Greene, Jr., said in a letter to Shearson@American
Express Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter A. Cohen, that
he suspended all business activity between the state Treasury's
office and Shearson on Wednesday.
   Greene said that ``business activity'' totaled $7 billion over
the past year.
   Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill said he did not know ``what
the $7 billion refers to,'' but added that ``overall there is no
evidence of any significant business impact.''
   British investor Brian Beazer sees Koppers as a strategic step
in his quest to build a worldwide building materials empire. As an
equity partner in Beazer's BNS Inc., which launched the tender
offer, Shearson agreed to provide the mortar for the deal with $570
million in bridge financing and about $23 million in equity
interest in BNS.
   ``We're providing a form of interim financing ... but it does
not translate into a long-term interest in the company,''
Shearson's O'Neill said. County Natwest Ltd., a British investment
bank, also agreed to take an equity position.
   ``There's a confusion over the nature of our financing ... We're
not the acquirer, Beazer is,'' O'Neill stressed. Under terms of a
complex financial package, Shearson will sell its stake in BNS back
to Beazer.
   On Thursday, Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., called for a
congressional investigation of Shearson's ``unique and highly
questionable hostile takeover attempt.''
   Walgren noted that Shearson's bid ``marks the first time that an
investment banking firm has both conceived of a hostile takeover
and acted as an equity partner in the deal.''
   If investment banks take on equity interests, Walgren said,
``corporate America will be controlled by banks at unprecedented
levels, and America's landscape will be littered with the empty
shells of abandoned office buildings and company plants.''
   Koppers has taken its own action against Shearson and American
Express. Earlier this week Koppers' management canceled its
American Express account, through which the company had been buying
about $1.5 million per year in goods and services.
   Koppers employees also shredded 175 American Express cards in
protest.
   Likewise, the Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce urged citizens to
``leave home without it'' by destroying their American Express
cards in sympathy.
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey on Friday ordered Shearson be
dropped as a potential advisor for a pending bond issue. The City
of Pittsburgh, which has sued Shearson to block the takeover, also
has suspended business dealings with the firm.

   The dollar closed mixed after moving in jagged
fashion Friday amid rumors that central banks stepped in to steady
the currency.
   Gold prices eased. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price for gold of $452.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down
from Thursday's late bid of $453.15 an ounce.
   Traders said the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan moved to
support the dollar as the yen continued its upward climb against
the major currencies. The dollar fell to levels against the yen not
seen since mid-January.
   Without the intervention, ``the beating would have been fairly
bad'' for the dollar, said Albert Soria, vice president and foreign
exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp.
   While sentiment is brewing that the narrowing of U.S. trade
deficits might be drawing to a close, traders continued to argue
that the dollar's drop is not so much related to fundamentals as it
is to the continued strengthening of the Japanese yen.
   ``There seems to be a very big demand for investors to be into
yen,'' said Stephen Flanagan, an assistant vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Dealers are wary that the Japanese will begin to dump their
dollar holdings once their fiscal year comes to a close on March
31, ``so the market is beginning to jump the gun'' by selling the
U.S. currency, Flanagan said.
   The dollar mostly weakened in Europe, where the pound was the
center of attention as it slumped on the heels of a British
government report of a disappointing trade deficit for February.
   The pound was hit by news that Britain's merchandise trade
deficit narrowed slightly in February to 1.3 billion pounds, or
$2.4 billion, from 1.4 billion pounds in January.
   The current account deficit, which includes invisible trade like
financial services, was pegged at 720 million pounds, or $1.3
billion, from 844 million pounds, the Department of Trade and
Industry said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 0.56 yen to a closing 125.74 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 125.33 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 125.30
yen, down from 125.575 yen Thursday.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.8360 from $1.8435 late Thursday.
In New York, it cost $1.84175 to buy one pound, cheaper than
Thursday's $1.8420.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.6760 West German marks, down from 1.67725;
1.3865 Swiss francs, up from 1.38625; 5.68625 French francs, down
from 5.6995; 1,238.50 Italian lire, down from 1,242.50, and 1.24205
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2421.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
were: 1.6760 West German marks, down from 1.6800; 1.3865 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3885; 5.6860 French francs, down from 5.7120;
1.8820 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8980; 1,241.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,246.95; and 1.2433 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2426.
   Gold prices eased. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold closed
at $453.20, a troy ounce, down from $454.10 on Thursday. In London,
gold fell to a late bid price of $451.70 a troy ounce from late
Thursday's $452.
   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid $451.50 compared
with $452 dollars late Thursday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell
$1.32 an ounce to close at $454.08.
   Silver closed at $6.665 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, down
from $6.735 on Thursday. In London, the metal was trading at a late
bid price of $6.64 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's
$6.61.

<HEAD>Resorts Seeking $600 Million Financing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc., target of rival
takeover bids from entertainer Merv Griffin and real estate
developer Donald Trump, is trying to line up $600 million in
high-yield bond financing, mostly to complete its overdue and
over-budget Taj Mahal hotel-casino.
   The financing negotiations were disclosed Friday by Trump, who
controls 88 percent of Resorts' voting strength, is the company's
chairman and is seeking to buy the rest of its stock and take it
private.
   Besides providing money to complete the Taj Mahal, proceeds from
the financing would be used for working capital and to reimburse
Trump for stock-purchase costs if his tender offer succeeds.
   While terms of the financing aren't complete, Trump said the
arrangement is contingent upon the success of his tender offer for
the company and upon Trump's guarantee that the Taj Mahal will be
finished.
   If Trump's takeover bid fails, the company may seek a smaller
amount of financing, Trump said.
   Trump has estimated it will take $550 million to complete the
sprawling and luxurious Taj Mahal, which would become Atlantic
City's biggest hotel-casino with 42 floors and 1,250 rooms.
   Final cost of the project is estimated to be $938.5 million, up
from an estimated $535 million when work on it began four years ago.
   Resorts has other hotel-casino operations in Atlantic City and
the Bahamas.
   Trump owns nearly all of the company's 572,000 shares of Class B
stock, which carries 100 votes per share. He is offering $22 per
share to buy the remainder.
   Besides Class B stock, the company has 5.7 million Class A
shares, which have one vote each.
   Griffin last week made a rival bid of $35 per share, or $225
million, for all of Resorts' stock, including that held by Trump.
Griffin later increased his offer to $295 million, leaving it up to
Resorts' board to decide how to apportion the $70 million increase
between the two classes of stock.
   Trump has repeatedly refused to sell his stock and has sued
Griffin for $250 million for allegedly interfering with Trump's
contractual obligations with Resorts.
   Griffin has sued Trump and Resorts' outside directors, claiming
among other things that they breached their fiduciary duty by
refusing to pursue Griffin's offer. Resorts' board said it didn't
pursue Griffin's proposal on grounds that Trump's rejection had
rendered it moot.
   On Thursday, the two sides disclosed the Securities and Exchange
Commission had begun looking into allegations of securities
violations, but they blamed each other's activities for triggering
the probe.
   Trump claimed statements and actions by Griffin and an ally had
a ``manipulative effect'' on the market for Resorts' stock.
   Griffin contended the SEC was looking into allegations of breach
of fiduciary duty and failure by Trump to disclose a new and higher
appraisal of Resorts' value in making his $22-per-share offer.
   Resorts shares rose 12{ cents Friday in American Stock Exchange
trading to close at $28.87{.

<HEAD>Four Apply To Build Bullet Train</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four applications to build a bullet
train linking Miami, Orlando and Tampa were submitted Friday after
six years of planning for the space-age but still conceptual rail
system.
   Details of the applications are to be revealed Monday in a
ceremony with Gov. Bob Martinez and legislative leaders.
   ``This is a major milestone in this project,'' said Diana Hull,
spokeswoman for the High Speed Rail Commission. ``Today's deadline
will put us one large step along toward putting high-speed rail in
Florida.''
   The commission expects to narrow the list to three
semifinalists, after a year's review, and award the franchise in
September 1991. Planners hope trains will be running by 1995, the
state's 150th birthday.
   State guidelines mandate the multibillion-dollar project must
link Miami, Tampa and Orlando, but the applicants will determine
precise routes, financing agreements and the technology to use.
   ``The first thing I want to know is, is what they're proposing a
real viable plan? Is it a politically do-able deal?'' said Cocoa
Beach developer and attorney Malcolm Kirschenbaum, one of the seven
businessmen on the commission.
   The team that wins the franchise will be allowed to develop
property for rail stations and connecting attractions, a financing
plan that mirrors one used by industrialist Henry Flagler who built
a rail line nearly 100 years ago down Florida's Atlantic Coast and
eventually to Key West.
   ``Property developed as a way to help finance the system must
have some transportation link to the high-speed rail,'' said Hull.
   Theoretically, those development deals will allow the franchisee
to recoup its $2 billion to $5 billion startup costs, while fares
will support rail operation and maintenance.
   Balancing financial arrangements, environmental concerns, growth
patterns and evolving technologies, the commission will select the
best overall plan _ or reject all of them _ and make a
recommendation to the governor and Cabinet.
   Initial fees for applicants are $35,000. Several months from
now, applicants will have to pay about $2,000 per mile, or about
$600,000, to cover more detailed reviews of their proposals.
   The four applicants are:
   _TGV of Florida Inc., a Washington D.C.-based team backed by the
French company Alsthom, which supplies the 160 mph TGV trains to
the French National Railways, and Bombardier Inc., a Canadian
manufacturing consortium.
   _All American MagnePlane Inc. of New Port Richey, which has an
agreement to purchase a Massachusetts Institute of Technology
patent for a magnetically driven rail flight system, said President
David Ramsey, a civil engineer and developer.
   The average speed of the train, which still is being developed,
is 250 mph, Ramsey said.
   _Stone & Webster Engineering Corp., a 100-year-old, Boston-based
international firm. Stone & Webster's proposal is based on the
French ANS Turboliner, a 150 mph train that can run on existing
track.
   _Florida High Speed Rail Corp., a 40-member, international team
based in Deerfield Beach. Headed by Amerifirst Development Corp.,
the company proposes an electrically powered system similar to
Swiss, Italian, West German and some American trains already
operating.
   A fifth company, Orange Blossom Railroad Corp., a division of
the Dallas-based Entrak Systems Inc. engineering firm, had been
considering an application but did not make the 5 p.m. deadline
Friday, said Hull.

<HEAD>Kansas City Southern Rejects Kaskel Merger Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. on
Friday rejected a proposal by New York investor Howard Kaskel to
discuss a merger, saying Kaskel actually intended to mount a
takeover bid.
   The railroad and financial services company received a letter
from Kaskel on Monday proposing talks concerning a possible
negotiated merger.
   Landon H. Rowland, president and chief executive of Kansas City
Southern, said the company's board of directors unanimously
rejected the proposal.
   ``It is clear to us that Mr. Kaskel's letter is merely a salvo
in his proposed proxy contest,'' Rowland said. ``Mr. Kaskel has not
even made a pretense of having sought or obtained financing,
confirming our view that he is merely attempting to put the company
into play.''
   Kaskel's investment group owns 11.3 percent of Kansas City
Southern's stock. The group said Monday it was offering $60 cash a
share, or about $594 million, for the remaining 89 percent.
   The stock closed Friday at $51.62{ per share, down $1.37{ per
share in national trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Kaskel said in his letter that he would attempt to place his own
slate of directors on the Kansas City Southern board if it rejected
or failed to act on his offer by April 4.
   He also accused the board of having erected obtacles ``designed
to entrench itself and to prevent stockholders from realizing a
full return on their investment.''
   Rowland said Friday that ``contrary to Mr. Kaskel's careless
statements impugning, without foundation, the motives of the Kansas
City Southern Industries directors, every action taken by the
directors has been entirely dedicated to the best interest of
Kansas City Southern Industries and its stockholders.''
   ``The board, after due review of Mr. Kaskel's letter, reaffirmed
its confidence in the company's future and its view that now is not
the time to sell the company,'' Rowland said.
   In reaching its conclusion, the company said the board obtained
an opinion from its investment banker, Lazard Freres & Co., which
reportedly said the Kaskel proposal was ambiguous and inadequate.
   The proposal appeared to be an effort to stimulate trading in
Kansas City Southern stock or to publicize Kaskel's plan to
nominate two persons to the company's board of directors, Kansas
City Southern said earlier.
   Richard Kaskel, one of the nominees, said Wednesday the investor
group would begin a proxy fight for the two slots. Four of Kansas
City Southern's 14 directors will be elected May 3 at the company's
annual meeting.
   Kansas City Southern's main holding is Kansas City Southern
Lines railroad, which is the country's 14th-largest line. The
company also owns 87.3 percent of DST Systems Inc., a financial
record keeper based in Kansas City, where it and affiliated
operations employ about 2,000 people.
   For the fiscal year that ended Dec. 31, Kansas City Southern
reported a profit of $17.7 million, or $1.82 a share, on revenue of
$507.6 million.

<HEAD>Customs Rules Samurai is Truck, Not Car; Seats Added After Import</HEAD>

   The U.S. Customs Service ruled Thursday that the
tiny Suzuki Samurai sport-utility vehicle will continue to be
counted as a truck since it enters the country without back seats,
which are added later.
   Suzuki Motor Co.'s Samurais are imported into the United States
as trucks because Suzuki doesn't have a large enough allocation
under the Japanese government's voluntary export restraints to ship
them as cars or sport-utility vehicles.
   ``This decision doesn't make any sense when people see how these
vehicles are being used in the United States, but in this case the
Customs Service has no choice,'' said Customs Commissioner William
von Raab.
   ``These are `trucks' under the law when they enter this
country,'' he said.
   Instead of paying a 2.5 percent car tariff, Suzuki pays a 25
percent truck tariff on each of the vehicles, which are shipped
without back seats to qualify as trucks.
   Rear seats are added either at the port of entry or at
dealerships. Few, if any of the small sport vehicles actually are
sold without rear seats. Suzuki sold 81,349 Samurais in this
country in 1987 and said it plans to sell 100,000 in 1988.
   Michigan Democrat John Dingell, chairman of the U.S. House
Energy and Commerce Committee, criticized von Raab's decision.
   ``It appears that Customs is still winking at the fact that the
Japanese are shipping seats into the U.S. separately, then
installing them here to evade both Customs laws and the (voluntary
export restraints),'' he said.
   ``We don't like illogical decisions any more than Commissioner
von Raab,'' Dingell said in a statement.
   Von Raab said Customs soon will seek public comment on the
creation of additional criteria that would simplify the
classification process.
   Last year, Customs and Commerce Department officials said the
U.S. government had little interest in helping the Japanese
government enforce its export limits, particularly since the U.S.
government takes in more money when foreign carmakers opt to pay
the 25 percent tariff instead of the lower fee.
   Other Japanese companies following Suzuki's practice include
Nissan Motor Corp., Isuzu Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and
Toyota Motor Corp., the companies said last year.
   The U.S. government has safety and fuel economy standards, among
other criteria, used to classify a vehicle as a car or truck for
those purposes.
   For example, trucks are not yet subject to the same roof-crush,
side-strength and high-mounted brake-light standards as cars.
   But those criteria are not used by the Customs Service, which
instead looks at features such as number of seats to determine a
vehicle's apparent purpose when it is imported.
   The Japanese government voluntarily limits exports of Japanese
cars to this country to 2.3 million per year.
   Under a less-publicized quota that was designed to cover station
wagons, which are considered trucks in Japan but cars in the United
States, the Japanese government also limits exports of
sport-utility vehicles and minivans shipped to this country to
113,000 to 115,000 a year.
   Suzuki, which gives nearly all its car allocation to General
Motors Corp. for the imported Chevrolet Sprint, built by Suzuki in
Japan, also has no sport-utility vehicle allocation.
   Earlier this year, Suzuki told the Customs Service it would be
forced to close its U.S. dealerships if the Samurai were classified
as a car.
   But when that information became public, Suzuki denied it had
any intention of closing dealerships and said it instead was
aggressively expanding its U.S. dealer network.

<HEAD>Pacific Enterprises to Buy More Texas Oil, Gas Properties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its second foray into the Texas oil and
gas market this month, Pacific Enterprises said Friday it has
agreed to buy Sabine Corp. of Dallas for $24 per share, or $339
million.
   That is a 20 percent premium over the $20 per share at which
Sabine's stock closed Thursday. In the past year, its stock has
traded as high as $20.75 per share and as low as $9.37{.
   The deal, which is contingent upon 75 percent of the company's
shares being tendered, has been approved unanimously by Sabine's
directors, the companies said.
   As part of the agreement, Pacific Enterprises received an option
to buy 2.6 million shares, or 18{ percent, for $24 per share.
   Sabine is engaged in exploration, development and acquisition of
crude oil and natural gas in the United States.
   Pacific Enterprises, which until recently was known as Pacific
Lighting Corp., is the parent of Southern California Gas Co. It
also has gas and oil exploration and pipeline operations and runs
drugstore and sporting goods chains.
   The deal will give Pacific Enterprises proved oil and gas
reserves equivalent to 32 million barrels of oil, plus $55 million
in cash and mineral rights and leaseholds to nearly 4 million acres
of land.
   It will boost Pacific Enterprises' proved reserves by 36 percent.
   Earlier this month, the company agreed to buy half the oil and
gas mineral rights under 70,000 acres in Texas for $93 million.
That acreage is on the Burnett Ranch in King County, Texas.

Operators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission voted
Thursday to rescind the freedom of a small number of cable
television systems to set their own rates for basic service.
   Municipal rate regulation was lifted for more than 90 percent of
the country's 7,800 cable TV systems in January 1987.
   The FCC's rules change, approved 3-0, will subject more systems
to regulation by municipal officials, but neither the FCC nor the
National Cable Television Association could estimate how many.
Both, however, said the number would be small.
   The Cable Communications Act deregulated the rates for basic
service of cable systems in areas that had ``effective
competition.'' Cable systems that met this test became free to set
their own rates for their basic tier of service, which includes the
retransmission of local broadcast TV signals.
   But a federal appeals court struck down one of the components of
the FCC's definition of that term and the agency's vote Thursday
was intended to address that decision.
   Under the new definition, a cable system will be deemed to have
competition if all residents in the franchise area receive at least
three over-the-air broadcast signals, not necessarily the same
three signals.
   Under the old defective definition, a cable system was found to
have competition if any three broadcast signals covered 75 percent
of the county where the cable system operated.
   The NCTA said it was disappointed in the decision since there is
no evidence that cable systems have abused their freedom to set
rates.
   ``But there appears little we can do about it'' because ``the
courts are unlikely to second guess the commission on this
matter,'' the trade association said.
   ``We, therefore, look to the record to be established by the
large majority of cable systems which will continue to be
deregulated to give us the ammunition to go back at some point in
the future and ask the commission to revisit this issue.''

<HEAD>Abboud: Bondholders Should Not Hold Out For Better Terms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Wednesday is CQ </NOTE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The successful rehabilitation of First City
Bancorporation of Texas Inc. is hindered by the apparent failure of
some debt holders to accept current conditions for tendering their
bonds, according to the head of a private group seeking to complete
a $1.5 billion restructuring of the company.
   ``Each day of delay costs money,'' said A. Robert Abboud, a
Chicago investor, in a speech to the French-American Chamber of
Commerce on Wednesday.
   As of last week, 51 percent of First City's $225.8 million in
bonds had been tendered, but the restructuring deal requires 90
percent participation by the close of business next Tuesday.
   ``It's not in their best interest to hang onto the bonds if
they're going to crater the deal in the process,'' Abboud said.
Caving into demands for better terms could set a negative precedent
for similar transactions in the future, he said.
   Senior debt holders have been offered 45 cents on the dollar for
their debt, while subordinated debt holders have been offered 35
cents.
   ``On a liquidation basis, their investment is worth zero,''
Abboud said, referring to the $100 million in subordinated debt.
``Once the preconditions are established, we have to stick to
them.''
   ``The professionals in the market should understand that
(banking) is not a regular industry,'' Abboud said. ``The
institutions that are so integral to our financial system should
know this.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Abboud is trying to restructure Houston-based First City using
$970 million in assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., $500 million infusion of capital raised privately by an
investor group headed by Abboud and a spinoff of $1.79 billion in
book value of poorly performing assets.
   First City, the state's fourth-largest bank holding company with
59 banks in Texas and one in South Dakota, grew quickly during the
Texas oil boom, but was hammered by energy and real estate losses
when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company posted a $1.1
billion loss.
   Abboud, who become chairman under the federal bailout plan, said
he was optimistic a deal could be closed by March 31. Besides a
successful tender, First City still needs to renegotiate
unfavorable leases. First City shareholders already have voted to
support the Abboud plan.

<HEAD>Automaker Earmarks $250 Million For Executive Bonuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will divide up $250 million this
year in bonuses for salaried employees who contributed to the
success of Ford and its subsidiaries in 1987, the company said in
its annual report Thursday.
   A proxy statement in the second week of April will reveal how
many people will be awarded executive bonuses by the board of
directors' compensation and option committee, Ford spokesman Thomas
E. Foote said.
   In 1987, the seven-member committee of directors from outside
the company awarded $164.3 million in bonuses for 1986 to 5,528
salaried Ford employees, Foote said.
   The 1986 bonuses ranged as high as $1.3 million for Donald E.
Petersen, chairman and chief executive officer, and $1.1 million
for Harold A. Poling, then president and now vice-chairman, Foote
said.
   The company does not divulge the amounts of executive bonuses or
other compensation except to the five highest-paid executives.
Their compensation will be revealed in the April proxy report, he
said.
   Ford had said in February it was distributing $635 million, or
about $3,700 each, to hourly employees as their share of the
company's record $4.6 billion in 1987 earnings.
   The compensation and option committee allocated the $250 million
for the executive bonuses out of a possible $363.9 million under a
formula in Ford's stockholder-approved supplemental compensation
plan, the annual report said.
   Foote said the $164.3 million awarded last year was out of a
possible $241.9 million.
   The annual report, mailed Wednesday to Ford's 250,000
shareholders and released publicly on Thursday, cited the income of
$4.6 billion _ highest annual earnings of any company in automotive
history _ despite the year's seven percent drop in U.S. car and
truck sales, higher capital spending and increased marketing costs.
   The report described a ``corporate culture ... based on the
understanding that no individual is responsible for designing,
engineering, manufacturing, assembling and selling a product.''
   The first page of the report was a tribute to Henry Ford II, who
led the company as president or chairman for nearly 35 years prior
to his retirement as chairman in 1979. Ford died Sept. 29. ``On all
he left his imprint,'' Petersen said in the memorial tribute.

<HEAD>Proposed Northwest Attendants Contract Would Eliminate Two-Tier
Scale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed contract for Northwest Airlines
flight attendants would eliminate a two-tier wage scale, add $75
million to the company's payroll to cover wage and benefit
increases and unify work rules, a company official said Thursday.
   Terry Erskine, Northwest's chief negotiator in contract talks
with Teamsters Local 2747, said that if ratified by the
rank-and-file the proposed contract would take effect June 1 and
expire Dec. 31, 1992.
   Jeff Musto, a spokesman for Local 2747, said the union
negotiating committee voted Wednesday night to submit the proposal
to the rank-and-file. Union officials have said they expect it to
be approved.
   The proposed contract was reached Tuesday, averting a strike
threatened for March 29.
   The final hurdle to the agreement had been how to treat
lower-paid B-scale employees who were to get an $800-a-month pay
raise by moving to the higher-paid A-scale after their fifth year
of service, Erskine and Musto said.
   The union wanted to retain the provision and Northwest wanted to
delay the pay raise until the eighth year. As a compromise, the
proposed contract will phase the 65 percent increase in after an
employee's seventh year of service.
   Workers would be paid under a single scale after 12 years with
the company, finally unifying scales of Northwest attendants with
those of their counterparts from the former Republic Airlines,
which was acquired by Northwest in 1986.
   The two-tier wage scale issue had intensified since the merger.
About a third of the 2,600 former Republic attendants are on the
lower pay scale, and the other two-thirds had said they wouldn't
get enough out of Northwest's previous wage offer.
   Under the proposal submitted for ratification, flight attendants
would get a 7.7 percent pay increase in their second year; a 6.4
percent increase in their fourth year, a 13.3 percent increase in
their sixth year and a 27 percent increase in their seventh year.
   Under the proposed new wage scale, most senior flight attendants
would earn about $35,500 a year in basic pay _ second in the
industry behind Delta Airlines, Erskine said. Entry-level flight
attendants would be paid about $15,000 a year in basic pay, close
to the industry average, he said.
   The contract also provides for pay raises of 2 percent in June
1990 and 3 percent in January 1992 for all current flight
attendants, and a variety of one-time bonuses.
   Former Republic Airlines workers also would be placed under the
Northwest pension plan, which would have its benefits boosted by 17
percent to make it level with the former Republic plan, Erskine
said.
   The pension and pay increases will add about $75 million to
Northwest's payroll over the life of the contract, Erskine said.
Some of the increase will be made up by adopting Northwest work
rules _ considered less expensive than rules covering the former
Republic workers _ for all the attendants.

<TEXT>
   February surges in personal income and consumer spending are
being cited by analysts as further evidence that the economy has
suffered no long-term effects from the October stock market crash.
   But the new government reports failed to cheer Wall Streeters on
Thursday, as stock prices took a nosedive that sent the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials down 43.77 points to 2,023.87.
   Separately, the government reported the savings and loan
industry lost $6.8 billion last year, its worst loss since the
Great Depression.
   In its latest eonomic report, the Commerce Department said
personal income of Americans rose 0.9 percent in February,
reflecting strong employment gains in the past few months. Spending
rose 0.7 percent, up sharply from a tiny 0.1 percent January
increase.
   Five months ago after the market crash, some analysts feared
consumer worries about the future would cause spending cutbacks
that could push the country into a recession.
   ``For people who were worried about a major consumer
retrenchment, these numbers are encouraging,'' said Sandra Shaber,
an economist with the Futures Group. ``As long as income gains hold
up, people will continue to spend.''
   Analysts said the February gain in incomes, which followed a 0.3
percent January rise and was the best showing since a 1.9 percent
October increase, reflected good employment news. The jobless rate
fell to an 8{-year low of 5.7 percent during the month.
   In its report on thrift earnings, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board said the $6.8 billion loss for the year included a $3.2
billion loss in the last three months of 1987.
   The year's loss was nearly 50 percent greater than the previous
post-Depression high of a $4.6 billion loss in 1981. The nation's
federally insured S&Ls had a modest $132 million profit for all of
1986.
   Earlier this month, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the
nation's federally insured commercial banks earned $3.7 billion in
1987.
   In other economic reports Thursday:
   _Business startups declined nationwide in 1987 for the first

said. The 7.7 percent overall decline, from 253,092 startups in
1986 to 233,710 last year, affected all industry sectors and all
regions, especially the South and Southwest.
   _The Treasury sold $6.5 billion in four-year notes at an average
yield of 7.90 percent, down from 8.33 percent at the last such
auction in December and the lowest level since four-year notes
averaged 7.89 percent last June 24.

   Energy futures have turned mixed amid doubts by
traders over whether OPEC's pricing committee can soothe the
turbulent market at its scheduled meeting next month.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intemediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled at $16.96 per
barrel Thursday, up 10 cents from Wednesday's close. The contract
had risen 49 cents on Wednesday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the April
contract for wholesale heating oil slipped 0.33 cent to 47.40 cents
per gallon, after rising 1.47 cents Wednesday. Unleaded gasoline,
up 0.93 cent on Wednesday, was up 0.08 cent to 47.33 cents a gallon.
   Oil prices have fallen recently amid allegations that
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries member states were
cheating on production levels as well as pricing rules.
   Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC's president, announced Wednesday that the
cartel's five-member pricing committee would meet during the first
week of April to discuss how to stabilize prices.
   Peter Beutel, an assistant director at Elders Futures Inc.,
speculated that no substantive action would be taken until OPEC's
regular meeting in June.
   ``A lot of people were wondering if anyting will come out of
Luckman's various pronouncements,'' he said.

<HEAD>Irving Considering Alternatives To Bank Of New York Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. is seeking a ``white knight''
friendly bidder and other alternatives to thwart Bank of New York's
hostile $1.08 billion tender offer, which began earlier this week.
   But Bank of New York says Thursday's announcement, made in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, changes nothing in its
six-month effort to acquire the rival bank holding company.
   In the filing, which was an official response to the hostile
bid, Irving said it was in the ``preliminary stages of negotiating
with third parties'' in connection with a possible merger,
reorganization, sale of assets or change in capitalization.
   Irving also said it has begun furnishing information to
unidentified parties its management intended to talk with still
more groups. Irving officials have refused to comment further on
the filing.
   Irving's board of directors repeatedly has denounced as
inadequate Bank of New York's offer to pay $15 in cash and 1.575
shares of its own stock for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 common
shares outstanding.
   ``From the information they've given we have no way of telling
if there's something going on or it's a lot of smoke,'' Bank of New
York spokesman Owen Brady said of Irving's SEC filing. ``We see
nothing substantative.''
   Industry analysts also were at a loss over what Irving's plans
might include, although Wall Street welcomed its disclosure as a
signal the bidding for Irving may escalate.
   In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving rose
$6.62{ to $66.25 a share while Bank of New York rose $1.12{ to
$31.37{ a share.
   ``I have no idea who they might be talking to,'' said Brent
Erensel, senior analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corp. ``But it seems to me the priority for Irving is to be
independent first, seek a white knight second, and last of all to
submit to the Bank of New York.''
   Michael Starr, an analyst with Duff and Phelps Inc. in Chicago,
said Irving possibly could keep its current managment team intact
by merging with a foreign bank with a strong capital structure.
   ``It would be difficult for one of the larger U.S. banks to
merge with Irving because .. (they) have relatively weak capital
structures,'' he said.
   Last month, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State
Banking Board cleared a Bank of New York-Irving merger, saying it
wouldn't hurt competition in the nation's biggest financial center.
   Irving has asked the federal courts to overturn the Fed's
decision.
   Earlier this week, Bank of New York received the SEC's go-ahead
to begin its tender offer, and the company also has assembled a
slate of 16 nominees to Irving's board. Bank of New York holds a
4.83 percent stake in Irving.
   Irving has stressed its desire to remain independent and has
taken a number of steps to spurn Bank of New York's advances,
including instituting an anti-takeover ``poison pill'' intended to
make any hostile buyout prohibitively expensive.
   In another effort to bolster its takeover defenses and place
stock in friendly hands, Irving recently issued $100.1 million
worth of cumulative convertible preferred stock to 15 investors.
The stock expands voting rights and offers other entitlements that
could foil a hostile bid.
   Bank of New York sued Irving in New York state court to void the
preferred issue.
   Bank of New York began its takeover efforts in September with a
bid of $1.4 billion, or $80 in cash and securities. It revised the
offer to $68 in cash and securities following October's stock
market crash, and lowered the offer a second time in late January.
   Hostile takeover efforts are rare in the banking industry. A
merger between New York Bank and Irving would create one of the
nation's 15 largest bank holding companies with combined assets of
more than $40 billion.

   Yields on four-year Treasury notes have
declined in the government's latest auction to the lowest level in
nine months.
   The average yield in Thursday's auction was 7.90 percent, down
from 8.33 percent at the last auction on Dec. 23.
   It was the lowest rate since four-year notes averaged 7.89
percent last June 24. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate
of 7~ percent, with each $10,000 in face value selling for
$9,991.60.
   A total of $6.5 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling
$17.2 billion.

<HEAD>GATT Rules Against Implementation Of U.S.-Japan Chip Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary finding that Japan has
violated international rules of commerce in its implementation of a
U.S.-Japanese semiconductor trade agreement does not necessarily
void the pact, officials say.
   The preliminary finding disclosed Thursday was made by a panel
of the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an
international body based in Geneva that oversees the world trading
system.
   The panel report said Japanese companies used improper means to
prop up the export prices of semiconductors, including production
controls and industrywide pricing rules.
   The panel's finding requires the approval of the GATT Council,
which meets May 4. It was made public Thursday by Willy De Clercq,
chief negotiator of the European Economic Community, and later
confirmed by the office of U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter.
   The GATT itself declined to comment on the panel's finding,
saying it remained confidential.
   The GATT panel made the ruling three weeks ago, with copies
given to the United States, Japan and the European Economic
Community. It was kept confidential in hopes that the parties could
work out their differences in private.
   The ruling was distributed Thursday to other GATT member
nations, even though exact terms of the finding have not been
publicly disclosed.
   The 1986 chip agreement was intended to stop Japan from
``dumping'' chips at unfairly low prices in the United States and
other markets and to open up the Japanese chip market to foreign
producers, including Americans.
   In Washington, Yeutter issued a statement saying the United
States was satisfied with the finding.
   ``The GATT panel has determined that the objectives of the
agreement are consistent with GATT rules but that some of the
Japanese implementation methods are not. That is what we have been
saying since the agreement went into effect,'' Yeutter stated.
   ``Some of these methods of implementation, such as production
controls, will need to be changed but the need to make these
changes does not relieve Japan of its obligation under the
semiconductor agreement,'' Yeutter said.
   Japan's alleged failure to abide by the pact triggered $300
million in U.S. retaliatory tariffs last year against selected
Japanese electronics imports. Of those sanctions, some $165 million
remain in place.
   Gary Holmes, a spokesman for Yeutter in Washington, said the
United States never intended that Japan cease third-country dumping
by market manipulation.
   However, he said the Japanese government had sought to comply
with the pact through ``production controls and quantitative
restrictions, things we in the United States never agreed to in the
first place. We never thought they were legal (under GATT
guidelines).''
   The U.S.-based Semiconductor Industry Association said the GATT
findings ``did not challenge the fundamental legitimacy of the
agreement between the United States and Japan.''
   Trade officials in the Japanese Embassy in Washington were away
from their offices near the end of their business hours Thursday
and could not be reached for comment.
   Competition from low-priced Japanese chips knocked most U.S.
producers out of the business of selling the memory chips known as
dynamic random access memories, or D-RAMs.
   In addition to complaining to GATT, the EEC has launched a probe
of its own into possible Japanese dumping of several types of
computer memory chips.
   The EEC probe involves chips known as Eproms, which is short for
erasable programmable read-only memories.
   If the Japanese memory chip manufacturers were found to charge
unfairly low prices, their exports to Europe could be subjected to
punitive levies.
   Francoise Le Bail, the Commission's spokeswoman, said the
Community's dumping investigation will continue despite the GATT
finding.

<HEAD>Santa Fe to Sell Black Mesa Pipeline, Completing Restructuring
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s planned sale of
its Black Mesa Pipeline Inc. subsidiary would complete a nearly
nine-month-old corporate restructuring to pare the railroad and
energy conglomerate's holdings.
   Santa Fe announced Thursday it had agreed to sell Black Mesa to
Williams Technologies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., at undisclosed terms.
   The Santa Fe restructuring announced June 30 was aimed at
reducing the company's holdings to five core businesses in
transportation, real estate and natural resources, said spokesman
Richard Hall.
   Chicago-based Santa Fe has sold or agreed to sell two other
pipeline companies, a building contractor company, a timber
company, a leasing business and the Southern Pacific Transportation
Co., one of its two railroads.
   The company expects to reap $1.7 billion after taxes from the
sale of the businesses.
   The restructuring plan included a $30-a-share payout to
stockholders totaling $4.7 billion.
   Hall said in a telephone interview that the restructuring was
intended to help pay down debt incurred in paying the special
dividend and to improve the company's long-term growth and earning
potential.
   Parts of the plan were bitterly opposed by two of Santa Fe's
largest shareholders, the Henley Group Inc. of La Jolla, Calif.,
and Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments Ltd. Both companies
failed in attempts to take control of Santa Fe and have apparently
abandoned the efforts.
   The 273-mile Black Mesa pipeline carries coal slurry from a mine
in northeastern Arizona to a power plant in southern Nevada.
   Completion of the restructuring will leave Santa Fe with its
Chicago-based Santa Fe Railway, San Francisco-based Santa Fe
Pacific Realty Corp., Houston-based Santa Fe Energy Co.,
Albuquerque, N.M.-based Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. and Los
Angeles-based Santa Fe Pipelines Inc.

<HEAD>Chairman of Ailing Texas Bank To Retire Early</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles H. Pistor Jr., chairman of troubled First
RepublicBank Corp.'s flagship bank will retire early, but not
because of the bank's financial problems.
   Pistor, who has been with the banking company since 1956, will
retire April 15, he announced Thursday.
   The 57-year-old Pistor, chairman of First RepublicBank Dallas,
also is president of the American Bankers Association, the banking
industry's main trade group.
   Pistor's announcement comes a week after First RepublicBank, the
state's largest bank holding company with $33.2 billion in assets,
announced it would seek federal assistance because of mounting loan
problems and deteriorating customer confidence.
   The FDIC gave First Republic a $1 billion capital loan last week
to stem a serious outflow of deposits.
   Bank officials are expected to recommend that Gerald W.
Fronterhouse, the corporation's chairman and chief executive
officer, assume Pistor's position.
   ``With the FDIC's stabilizing assistance and assurance that all
depositors are fully protected, the permanent solutions and
restructuring of First RepublicBank are beginning, and I have asked
Jerry (Fronterhouse) not to consider me for responsibilities in the
ongoing institution,'' Pistor stated.
   The company also announced Thursday that Joseph R. Musolino,
vice chairman of First RepublicBank, was elected company president.
Fronterhouse will continue serving as chairman.
   Although senior First RepublicBank executives had agreed to
resign if asked by the FDIC, as a condition of the $1 billion loan,
FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Pistor's resignation had not been
sought.
   Pistor joined the RepublicBank Organization in 1956 and became
president and a director of RepublicBank Dallas, then called
Republic National Bank of Dallas, in 1974. He was elected chairman
of the Dallas bank and a director of the holding company in 1980.

<HEAD>Book Says GM Chief Has Vision But Not Implementation Skills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. officials are shrugging off
a new book by a former employee who portrays GM Chairman Roger
Smith as a man with a high-tech vision who lacked the people skills
to implement it.
   In his book, ``Call Me Roger, Albert Lee calls Smith's
stewardship at GM since 1981 a ``tragedy in leadership.''
   Lee, a GM speech writer from 1984 to 1987, cites plant closings,
GM's decreasing share of the auto market, Ford Motor Co.'s
ascendance as industry profit leader and Smith's public rift with
former GM board member H. Ross Perot, founder of Electronic Data
Systems, in making his conclusions.
   GM, which acquired EDS in 1984, agreed last year to pay Perot _
a harsh critic of GM management _ $700 million in return for his GM
holdings and resignation from the board of directors.
   Lee wrote of Smith that, following the Perot departure, ``By
almost every measure of management achievement...his leadership had
failed.''
   Lee's former boss, GM public relations vice president Jack
McNulty, questioned Lee's conclusions.
   ``(He's) just one guy who worked here two or three years, and he
was in Roger's office maybe six times. I don't think he's qualified
to talk about GM,'' McNulty said.
   The book is due in bookstores next month and will be excerpted
in Playboy's May issue.
   ``Roger is aware of the book,'' said GM spokesman Jim Crellin,
asked Smith's reaction. ``I don't know if he's read any of it, but
all we're saying is that we don't think the book's worth commenting
on.''
   Lee said Smith advanced via a fast-track executive development
program that left him unschooled in the art of motivating
employees. He said Smith failed to realize that to make full use of
its new technology, GM would require the support of workers from
its design labs to its shop floor.
   McNulty, who helped arrange interviews for Lee and read an early
draft of the book, disputed that contention.
   ``We've got the most modern plant structure in the industry,''
he said. ``We think we've got the best product line. Roger has
often said, `We've crossed the river and others have yet to cross
it.'''
