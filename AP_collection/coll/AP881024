   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis hopes his flagging campaign gets a boost from his
appearance on ``Nightline'' tonight that goes beyond the television
program's viewers.
   Dukakis, trailing Republican George Bush in the polls with just
two weeks until Election Day, seems to have everything to gain from
his appearance on the 90-minute edition of the ABC News program.
   The interview by host Ted Koppel will be conducted face-to-face,
a format the Massachusetts governor insisted on.
   ``For the governor, it's more natural than staring into a camera
lens,'' Dukakis spokeswoman Elizabeth Bartle said.
   Although Koppel has interviewed some subjects in person before,
his guests are usually in a separate studio, listening to the host
through an earphone and at times viewing Koppel on a monitor.
   Dukakis campaign officials say this session will be conducted
with the two men sitting side by side in an 11th floor suite in the
Hyatt Regency Tech Center in Denver, where the candidate will have
been campaigning.
   The governor agreed earlier this month to appear on
``Nightline'' after ABC invited Dukakis and Bush to appear together
on the program. Bush turned the offer down, saying that two debates
between the two candidates were sufficient, and that he would be
too busy campaigning.
   The ``Nightline'' interview comes during a spurt of Dukakis
television appearances in recent days. He appeared on ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' and CBS's ``This Morning'' last Friday; was on
CNN's ``Larry King Live'' Monday night with his wife, Kitty, in an
interview taped Sunday; and Mrs. Dukakis appeared Sunday on CBS's
``Face the Nation.''
   ``It's an opportunity for the governor to speak directly to as
many American citizens as he can reach,'' Ms. Bartle said.
   Dukakis and his aides are banking on the candidate handling
himself well with Koppel, one of television's most respected
interviewers, and on news of his performance reaching more than the
late night show's 7 million viewers.
   ``He'll get an opportunity to dominate the network news not only
Tuesday night but Wednesday, when he should be able to control the
sound bites,'' said Michael J. Robinson, an associate professor of
government at Georgetown University who has studied the
relationships between the press and politicians.
   With the live interview being broadcast at 11:30 p.m. EDT, a
large portion of the viewers staying up to watch will be
politically active or involved people, and very few of them will be
those undecided voters Dukakis needs to win over, Robinson said.
Yet even among the politically involved there will be a value to
Dukakis' appearance.
   ``He'll persuade people who follow him that it's not over,''
Robinson said. ``He'll make an impassioned appeal to his own
supporters to really work the next two weeks.''
   Penn Kimball, professor emeritus in journalism at Columbia
University's Graduate School of Journalism, agrees with Robinson's
evaluation.
   Kimball said ``Nightline'' is ``a fantastic word-of-mouth
program'' that people seem to talk about the next day.
   ``It's the bounce off the program'' that counts, Kimball said.
``It's what the media says happened in the Koppel interview that
will be in all the papers and the evening programs. Those bounces
are the ones that will reach the broader audience.''
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin said there was no chance
that the vice president would change his mind and appear on the
program.
   ``We've done `Nightline' already,'' he said.
   Bush appeared on the program on a live hook-up from Houston
after he won the GOP presidential nomination. When Dukakis agreed
to appear on the show shortly afterward, he sought a face-to-face
interview but was turned down. The program's producers felt it
would be fairer to conduct the questioning the same way Bush had
done it, said ``Nightline'' spokeswoman Laura Wessner.
   The network's invitations to appear on tonight's show made it
clear that the format for the interview was negotiable, Wessner
said.

<HEAD>Gorton, Lowry Change Styles In Hopes of Capturing Senate Seat</HEAD>

   Altering images is the tack both Slade
Gorton and Mike Lowry are following in their quest for the U.S.
Senate with the former Republican senator hoping to revive his
political career and the Democratic congressman looking to move up
to a six-year job.
   Lowry, a five-term representative, has calmed his bombastic
rhetoric and trademark arm-flailing, shaven his Yasser Arafat-style
beard, pressed his usually rumpled suits and sworn off beer for the
campaign.
   Gorton has been apologetic about his failure to listen and a
number of his earlier Senate votes, and is warming an icy, detached
image that he blames in large part for his loss to Democrat Brock
Adams two years ago.
   That defeat also stems from Gorton's infamous vote swap. In May
1986, the White House agreed to nominate liberal Democrat William
L. Dwyer _ a Gorton recommendation _ to the federal bench only
after Gorton, then a freshman senator, agreed to provide the last
vote needed to confirm conservative lawyer Daniel Manion as a
federal appeals judge.
   For all the style changes, the liberal Democrat and
moderate-to-conservative Republican remain neck-and-neck in
Washington's first Senate race in 44 years without an incumbent.
   Republican Sen. Dan Evans surprised the political establishment
when he decided to step down after serving the remaining five years
of the late Sen. Henry M. ``Scoop'' Jackson's term.
   Polls conducted earlier this month found Gorton holding a slight
lead over Lowry, but based on the margin of error in the surveys
the contest is a dead heat.
   Yet on issues ranging from defense and taxation to the war on
drugs and abortion, the candidates remain far apart.
   Lowry wants to cut military spending, especially on defense
systems such as Star Wars and the MX missile, and use the money for
education, health, transportation, public works and housing.
   Gorton, a former Air Force officer, insists the nation is more
secure because of the military build-up over the last eight years
and warns that ``we shouldn't abandon any deterrent system'' before
gaining concessions in arms talks with the Soviets.
   Gorton favors construction of a Navy homeport for the U.S.
Nimitz carrier task force at Everett on Puget Sound. Lowry calls it
an environmentally hazardous ``home pork.''
   When the House passed a controversial anti-drug law to impose
the death penalty on drug murderers and slap heavy fines on users,
Lowry was one of only 30 votes against it. He opposed a number of
the bill's provisos as unconstitutional.
   Gorton cited Lowry's vote as another sign he is out of step with
the state of Washington, where drugs and gangs emigrating north
from California have become more common.
   Gorton says no to federal tax hikes; Lowry has not ruled them
out.
   The Senate hopefuls both are fighting to be seen as the
candidate of the broad middle of the electorate, particularly the
Reagan Democrats and independents who will swing the election.
   Lowry says his progressive brand of politics fits
Democratic-leaning Washington. Gorton says his own more
conservative approach is in the mainstream and that Lowry is a
liberal maverick who's out of step.
   This diversity has failed to move either candidate into a clear
lead with the Nov. 8 election looming.
   ``Mike Lowry is a tough competitor, no question about that,''
concedes Gorton. ``He has done a good job of moderating his image
from the way he presents himself in Congress to the middle of the
road out here.
   ``I am an awful lot closer to the views of the vast majority of
people. I am in fact, both in philosophy and in voting record, a
moderate conservative. That is what the vast majority of the people
feel comfortable with. Mike is a dedicated and articulate liberal
in Congress.''
   Lowry disagrees with Gorton's assessment of the voters, if not
Lowry's record.
   ``We have an excellent chance of winning because the people of
the state of Washington agree with us on the issues,'' he said.
``When you compare Slade's record in six years in the Senate and my
10 in the House, the choice is clear.''

<HEAD>At Age 20, International Think Tank Turns To Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Club of Rome, best known for its first report
warning of the dangers unlimited growth pose to the planet, is
bringing together thinkers and world leaders this week to celebrate
its 20th anniversary.
   And in addition to fostering discussion on what it calls `a new
global society,'' the club plans internal changes that will for the
first time seek to turn its ideas into action.
   Club members come from 51 countries _ rich and poor, capitalist,
socialist and communist.
   ``I think we are at a turning point in the life of the club
after 20 years,'' Secretary-General Bertrand Schneider said in an
interview in his Paris office.
   The Club of Rome _ which despite its name has been based in
Paris since 1984 _ was founded by Italian industrialist Aurelio
Peccei and Scottish scientist Alexander King in 1968 as a sort of
floating international think tank.
   The club committed itself to approaching issues from a global
perspective, with a sense that problems like pollution,
overpopulation, hunger or the impact of developing technologies are
interdependent.
   ``Governments and international organizations are stuck in the
day-to-day management of problems. They usually have no time for
long-term thinking. We have a special mission. We have no
responsibility to anybody except ourselves,'' Schneider said.
   At this week's conference, such international figures as Prince
Sadruddin Aga Khan, former President Belisario Betancur of
Colombia, Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and International Monetary
Fund Director Michel Camdessus are meeting to discuss ``Reasons to
Live and to Hope in a New Global Society.''
   A highlight will be a session Friday night at the Sorbonne
intended to be an exchange between the club's luminaries and youth
of the world.
   ``In a world that has become so young, we need their help to
understand the world,'' Schneider said. ``It's important for us,
and for them, to exchange our experiences.''
   The club's first report, ``Limits to Growth,'' was the spark for
a worldwide reassessment of the environmental, economic and social
dangers of untrammeled expansion.
   Published as a book, the report has sold 10 million copies in 27
languages.
   ``It provoked a very passionate debate all around the world, and
it's not finished,'' Schneider said. ``The idea of Zero Growth has
been falsely attributed to the Club of Rome. Some industrialists
did not like the idea at all, of course.''
   The club's commitment to act, as well as talk, is about to have
its first major test in a development project scheduled to start
next year in eight countries of the drought-prone Sahel in Africa.
   The project will coordinate U.N. forces, local government and
aid organizations to promote development and reclaim land from the
spreading desert.
   Schneider said the club is to be the ``catalyst'' rather than
the planner or organizer of the project.
   ``The peaceful U.N. force is to assure logistics of stopping the
desertification and starting development, building camps and
greenhouses, digging wells, planting trees, ensuring communications
and transport,'' he said.
   It is intended to last at least five years, but the hope is to
make rapid progress ``in order that the population can see the
immediate improvement in their daily lives.''
   In its private sessions this week, the club intends to overhaul
its organization, establishing a collective presidency, increasing
its visibility and setting up a budget, for the first time.
   ``We started by saying that we were a non-organization. Now we
all accept the fact that we are a small, modest organization, but
an organization,'' Schneider said.
   ``We think that in a world which is very often blocked by
ideologies, bureaucracies and economic short-term interests, we
offer the flexibility, the informality and the possibility for very
quick decision and intervention, which may be useful for the whole
world community.''

   Sen. Dan Quayle is accusing the Democrats
of trying to polarize the electorate and predicts that presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis will ``grasp at any straw'' in the final
two weeks of the campaign.
   ``We can't take anything for ganted,'' the vice presidential
nominee said in exhorting a Louisville riverboat audience to work
hard for the GOP ticket headed by Quayle's running mate, George
Bush.
   Later at a rally in Lexington, Quayle outlasted a sizable group
of pro-Dukakis demonstrators who disrupted his indoor rally with
repeated chanting.
   ``What they don't want to hear is the truth,'' an unruffled
Quayle said as the demonstrators waved Dukakis signs and placards
linking Bush to Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Quayle was campaigning today in Lexington before traveling to
Stone Mountain and Augusta, Ga., and later Florida. Both Southern
states are considered likely wins for Bush, but Quayle is making
the trip to help GOP candidates, in particular senate contender
Connie Mack III of Florida.
   On Monday, at the riverboat fund-raising event on the Ohio
River, Quayle talked about the intensity and negativism heading
into the home stretch of the campaign.
   ``Boy is it getting nasty out there ... they'll grasp at any
straw. They're going to try and polarize the American electorate.
They'll say anything that comes to their mind whether it's true or
not,'' he said.
   Later, Quayle's rowdy indoor rally was disrupted by a loud group
of Dukakis supporters chanting, ``No more lies'' and
``Bush-Noriega.''
   Quayle interrupted his remarks to respond to the protesters.
Gesturing in their direction, he said, ``If I had to support
Michael Dukakis, I'd yell too. I would shout and scream and yell
because he ain't gonna make it.''
   The demonstrators, however, continued chanting, nearly drowning
out the candidate in the outer corridor of Rupp Arena.
   But Quayle prevailed, proceeding to attack Dukakis to the
delight of the Bush-Quayle supporters who burst into chants of
``Good Night, Mike.''
   Earlier Monday, Quayle branded it a diversionary tactic for
former Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson and Quayle's vice
presidential opponent, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, to accuse the
Bush campaign of racists appeals.
   ``It's totally absurd. I think it shows just how desperate they
really are to start fanning the fires of racism in this country,''
Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane en route to
Missouri.
   Jackson alleged the Bush campaign was sending a racial signal by
hammering Dukakis over the case of convicted murderer Willie
Horton, Jr. Horton, a black man on a weekend furlough from a
Massachusetts prison, brutalized a Maryland couple.
   In Missouri, Quayle used a stop at East Central College in Union
to toss a baseball around and take a shot at Dukakis.
   Reporters noted after Quayle hit a couple of grounders that
Dukakis also likes to play baseball now and then on the campaign
trail and asked Quayle how he thought he would do against the
Massachusetts governor.
   Quayle laughed and said, ``I never served with Michael Dukakis
and I don't know him but he's no baseball player.''
   The remark was a paraphrase of a Bentsen putdown of Quayle when
the Republican compared himself with President John Kennedy during
the vice presidential debate.

<HEAD>High Levels Of Radon Found In Many European Homes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of European homes
have high radon levels but officials say many people question the
danger in spite of research linking the colorless, odorless gas to
fatal lung cancer.
   Some researchers feel the continent may be years behind the
United States in developing programs to meet the threat.
   ``We were two years behind the United States in recognizing the
problem and it will take another two to three years to catch up,''
said Bernd Franke of the West German Institute for Energy and
Environmental Research in Heidelberg.
   A traditional popular belief that the gas has curative powers
compounds the problem. A few radon spas still operate in Austria
and Hungary, and people still descend into deep caves in hopes the
gas will help cure rheumatism and other ailments.
   Radon is a radioactive gas produced in the decay of uranium, of
which at least trace amounts are present in all soil and rock.
   It tends to concentrate on the lower floors of buildings and
kills by leaving its a residue in the lungs that irradiates the
tissues for a lifetime. Smoking substantially increases the danger
from radon, according to health officials.
   U.S. health officials say radon exposure is second only to
smoking as a cause of lung cancer and up to 20,000 Americans die of
its effects each year. Legislation pending in Congress would
require inspections of public schools and set a long-term goal of
making air equally low in radon indoors and outdoors.
   American officials have declared 4 picocuries of radon per liter
of air (150 becquerel per cubic meter) to be the level at which
homeowners should take preventive action. That is the equivalent of
smoking 10 cigarettes a day or having 200-300 chest X-rays a year.
   West Germany recently set radon action limits at 250 becquerel
per cubic meter, the equivalent of 6.6 picocuries. The limit for
new houses in Sweden is 75 becquerel, or 2 picocuries.
   Extensive testing and research programs are under way in
Britain, West Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland.
   ``It's going to take a long time to pin down the houses at
risk,'' said Matthew Gaines of the National Radiological Protection
Board in Britain. ``We'll be testing until the end of the century.''
   Recent European studies have found:
   _ More than 20,000 British homes have high radon levels and
800-900 people die annually as a result of exposure to it. The
Radiological Protection Board is testing a sample 17,000 homes,
most of them in Devon and Cornwall where the problem is most
serious.
   _ In Sweden, about 40,000 homes have unsafe levels of radon and
roughly 60,000 houses are tested each year. More than 700 deaths a
year are attributed to the gas and officials say the rate could
reach 1,100 in the early 1990s.
   _ Up to 190,000 homes in West Germany have radon levels above
government safety standards and about 2,000 radon-related deaths
occur annually. Initial tests show the highest levels in the south
and southwest.
   _ Homes in volcanic areas of the upper Lazio region north of
Rome had Italy's highest radon concentrations.
   _ Most homes in Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece
showed little radon risk to residents.
   French officials have said radon is not a serious health risk in
that country and some have discounted publicity about the gas in
the United States and elsewhere.
   ``It's a question that's been a bit blown up in the media,''
said Jean-Pierre Moroni of the government radiation control agency.
``There's a very simple measure. ... Open a window when you get up.
It's a matter of good sense. It amounts to not living all closed
up.''
   French environmental activists disagree.
   ``To say there is no problem in France is a mistake,'' said
Corinne Castanier, who speaks for the Independent Regional
Commission for Information on Radioactivity.
   She said her group, established after the Chernobyl nuclear
accident in 1986, has found high levels in some homes in the
mountainous Massif Central region.
   Officials in Britain and West Germany say they have trouble
convincing residents of the danger.
   ``I think a lot of the reaction is a bit skeptical,'' said
Albert Weeks, chief building control inspector for the Kerrier
District Council in Cornwall, southwest England.
   ``It's almost a non-belief. They don't really think it's that
bad. They say `We've been living with it for X number of years and
it doesn't seem to affect us.''' Weeks said.
   Sweden, where 10 percent of the land area contains high-risk
levels of radon, has led the way in testing and helping homeowners
reduce their risk of radon exposure.
   A new law provides financial help for homeowners who make
radon-reducing improvements. The government also has begun a study
of 4,500 people to gain more information on the relationship
between radon and lung cancer.

<HEAD>West European Bankers Making Major Deals With Soviets</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

   West European bankers are
offering the Soviets huge amounts of credit to use in modernizing
their consumer economy, but Japan's relations with Moscow are cool
and its bankers are holding back.
   State Department sources in Washington emphasize that the deals
do not involve direct loans, but lines of credit, which become
loans only as the available credit is used.
   They said the credit lines appear designed to finance specific
trade arrangements and cannot be classed as ``untied loans'' _
money to be spent however the borrower chooses.
   The Unites States does not oppose lending at market rates for
non-strategic purposes but is against government subsidies of
loans, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Peter Pietsch, a finance and trade expert with West Germany's
Commerzbank, told The Associated Press: ``Credit not only from West
Germany but from all of Western Europe will be increasing and
expanding in coming years.''
   ``This has to do with the Soviet Union's goal of opening up
politically and economically, which also includes an increase in
trade activities,'' said Pietsch, whose institution is the
third-largest private bank in the country.
   ``The Soviets can only accomplish more activity in trade if they
have enough loans from Western countries. By helping the Soviet
Union modernize now, we can create the climate and conditions for
an even larger trade market in the future.''
   Commerzbank is part of a consortium of West German banks _ led
by Deutsche Bank, the country's largest _ that arranged a credit of
$1.6 billion.
   It was established to finance West German exports to the Soviet
Union, particularly in the food, leather, textile and clothing
industries.
   Officials signed the agreement Oct. 17, a week before Chancellor
Helmut Kohl began a visit to Moscow that is expected to produce
major benefits for West German businesses eager to expand trade.
   Other bankers in Western Europe are either following the German
lead or preparing to do so.
   On Oct. 14, Italy set up an export credit worth $775 million it
said was intended to help the Soviets modernize, with the money to
be used only to buy machinery in Italy for the production of
consumer goods. A group of banks led by the state-owned
Mediocredito Centrale organized the deal.
   London bankers involved in trade talks between Britain and the
Soviet Union confirmed Thursday they were willing to provide a
credit of $1.74 billion.
   Sir Michael Palliser, deputy chairman of Midland Bank PLC, told
a news conference the banks had agreed on a package of proposals
and a representative of the group would make a formal proposal next
week in Moscow.
   Bankers said 85 percent of the credit line would be backed by
the British government's Export Credits Guarantee Department.
   Other banks involved are the London-based Moscow Narodny Bank
Ltd., Barclays, Lloyd's Bank, National Westminster, Bank of
Scotland and Morgan Grenfell Group.
   Alan Clarke and Konstantin Katushev, the British and Soviet
trade ministers, also announced an agreement Thursday for
manufacturing of light commercial vehicles in the Soviet Union,
worth up to $297 million, and a small joint venture in photocopying.
   Katushev said the British credit line and those from West
Germany and Italy would be used primarily to modernize light
industry.
   ``We have enterprises with equipment that doesn't meet modern
requirements, and we have enterprises that don't have enough
capacity,'' he said.
   In France, the respected newspaper Le Monde reported last week
that a French consortium was proposing a credit to the Soviet Union
worth about $2 billion. It said the group of banks was led by
Credit Lyonnais, France's second-largest.
   Francois Riche, spokesman for Credit Lyonnais, would not comment
on the Le Monde report but confirmed that Jean-Yves Haberer, the
bank president, would travel to the Soviet Union on Nov. 10.
   Riche said Credit Lyonnais has had frequent dealings with the
Soviets over many years.
   Japanese bankers are taking a much more cautious approach. An
analyst with the Long-Term Credit Bank in Tokyo said similar large
credits from his and other private Japanese institutions are
unlikely, mainly because of cool Soviet-Japanese relations
resulting from a territorial dispute.
   ``The government attitude toward the Soviets is not really
clear, so it is rather difficult for commercial banks to get
together and form a loan credit as they are currently doing in
Europe,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   An analyst with the Industrial Bank of Japan added that
consortiums are not necessary in his country because Japanese banks
nearly alway negotiate individually. ``The Soviet Union has not
asked us for the loan credit,'' he said.
   Japan and the Kremlin still have not signed a World War II peace
treaty, and Japan demands the return of islands off Hokkaido taken
by the Soviets.

<HEAD>Jackson Supporters Gradually Enter Dukakis Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson supporters who felt overlooked
by Michael Dukakis have gained strategic positions in the
Democratic presidential campaign, although Jackson's former manager
said it may be ``too little too late.''
   ``The kind of campaign we have going on in Michigan, the kind of
campaign we have going on in Ohio, is the kind of campaign we
should have had going on since Labor Day,'' said former Jackson
campaign manager Gerald Austin.
   In Michigan, where Dukakis lost to Jackson in a caucus landslide
in March, Joel Ferguson had been complaining that once the
Massachusetts governor secured the Democratic presidential
nomination, he sent in a bunch of out-of-towners to run his general
election campaign.
   Ferguson, who had managed Jackson's campaign in the state, said
a month ago that Jackson people virtually were being ignored and
that it could cost Dukakis the election in Michigan.
   This week, as Dukakis barnstormed the state to revive his
sagging candidacy, Ferguson was flying on the candidate's plane
with him.
   ``They listened to him, and I think you have a better campaign
in Michigan because Joel is involved,'' Austin said in a telephone
interview.
   In the first weeks after the Democratic National Convention last
July, the Dukakis campaign did hire former Jackson supporters, but
few had ``meaningful'' positions, Austin said.
   But Ron Brown, who was Jackson's convention manager and now is
an unpaid senior political adviser to the Dukakis campaign, said he
was unaware of anyone being brought into the Dukakis campaign
strictly for appearance's sake.
   Brown said the Dukakis campaign started bringing in Jackson
people right after the national convention, although he
acknowledged the process was slow at the campaign's Boston
headquarters and spotty in the state organizations.
   ``I'm not saying it was a perfectly smooth transition in every
state,'' Brown said. ``It wasn't.''
   Black voters did not appear to have been impressed by those
early efforts. A Gallup poll of 643 black voters taken in August
for the Joint Center for Political Studies found that 42 percent
thought Jackson had been mistreated at the national convention and
a third of that group said they were less likely to vote because of
it.
   Nationwide, the Dukakis campaign began moving former Jackson
operatives into responsible jobs in late September and early
October, Austin said.
   ``It could be too little too late,'' Austin said. ``I hope not.''
   Brown himself was brought into the Dukakis campaign in an
official capacity three weeks ago. His volunteer status is by his
own choice, he said.
   Austin said things began changing in September, after the return
of John Sasso, who resigned from the Dukakis campaign last year
following his admission of torpedoing Sen. Joseph Biden's candidacy
for the Democratic presidential nomination. One of Sasso's first
actions after rejoining the campaign was to meet with Jackson.
   ``I think now Jackson speaks to Dukakis two or three times a
week,'' Austin said. ``I think he talks to Sasso even more.''
   Jackson also is traveling around the country to rally support
for the Democratic ticket and has made radio commercials urging
people to vote.
   Dukakis attended a Sunday breakfast in Boston with Jackson and
eight other black political leaders who pledged to support the
Massachusetts governor's campaign in the remaining two weeks before
election.
   In Mississippi and Louisiana, among the dozen states and
territories Jackson won during the primaries, the Dukakis campaign
had little choice but to include Jackson supporters because they
control the state party.
   In Alabama, another Jackson state, the problem hasn't been
getting Dukakis to pay attention to the Jackson people but getting
him to pay attention to Alabama, said state Sen. Michael Figures, a
Jackson campaign leader in the state. Dukakis has been there only
once, and vice presidential running mate Lloyd Bentsen has not
campaigned there at all.
   Similar disappointment was expressed by former Jackson delegates
in New Jersey, which has 16 electoral votes.
   ``He goes to Union but not Newark,'' said Newark Mayor Sharpe
James. ``He goes to a college campus but not Camden or Trenton.''

<HEAD>High-Tech Dream Often Just That</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many rural communities searching for economic
revival hope to attract high-tech industry, but an Agriculture
Department researcher says they should think twice before investing
much time or money in the effort.
   A new factory to design or build gadgets for space robots might
seem the opportunity of the century, with hundreds of new jobs and
a fat monthly payroll.
   But James P. Miller of the department's Economic Research
Service says that dream is hard to make come true.
   In some cases, he says, computer and other high-tech companies
do locate research and development operations in the countryside.
But usually this is done only when local resources, such as
research facilities, match their needs.
   More often, rural communities wind up with ``the most routine
assembly tasks'' of the high-tech companies because of the
lower-skilled work involved and lower wages, Miller says.
Consequently, local development leaders shouldn't be overly
optimistic.
   ``High-tech firms may not be as footloose as many have been led
to believe, particularly when they are in their most innovative
state of development,'' Miller writes in a forthcoming issue of
Farmline magazine.
   But communities keep trying, and he says it is easy to see why
they do. Jobs and incomes have been lost in agriculture, mining,
forestry and low-wage, low-technology manufacturing.
   ``Some planners believe that rural areas should attempt to
encourage investment in the fast-growing high-technology industries
because these industries are clean and are perceived to pay high
wages,'' Miller said.
   The high-tech industries most often include communications,
electronics, defense systems, computers and software. Some of the
sophisticated products are guided missile components and
engineering, and medical instruments.
   Miller said states and local communities are committing an
increasing share of their scarce economic development resources to
high-tech development programs. One recent report, he said, cited
38 such programs in 22 states.
   But so far, Miller said, studies show that the clear tendency is
for new high-tech facilities to locate in urban areas.
   ``Computer manufacturing and software industries showed the
strongest tendencies among high-level R&D industries to concentrate
in metro areas,'' he said. ``New computer manufacturing
establishments tended to locate in urban areas, primarily in the
Northeast and West. But they were poorly represented in rural areas
of every part of the country except New England, where many rural
areas are highly integrated with urban areas.''
   On the other hand, rural areas can attract ``low-tech industries
involved in non-innovative, routine production activities,'' Miller
said. And there are always exceptions in which rural areas appeal
to certain kinds of high-tech companies _ sometimes because those
operations are unwelcome in big cities.
   ``Rural areas in most parts of the country tend to have a
comparative advantage in the production of chemical products, and
to a lesser extent, petroleum refining, ordnance, radio and TV
manufacturing, and the assembly of electrical apparatus,'' he said.
   It is also clear that high-tech companies don't usually move
themselves lock, stock and barrel into the countryside.
   ``Locally owned, independent firms account for only about 11
percent of all jobs created by new high-tech firms in rural
America,'' Miller said. ``Corporate affiliates are the dominant
form of new, high-tech business activity in rural areas, comprising
nearly 90 percent of the jobs in such industries.''
   Miller said high-tech firms, particularly those in innovative
and development phases, are attracted to cities by the availability
of professional and skilled workers, investment capital and close
contact with customers, suppliers and other high-tech companies.
   In contrast, high-tech facilities that are located in rural
areas are likely to be affiliates of urban-based corporations that
have opened remote assembly plants in order to avoid high costs of
labor, land and other production items.
   ``Large corporations based in cities tend to expand research
facilities in good times and reduce or eliminate them in bad times,
with those located farthest from urban centers being most likely to
experience large changes in employment,'' Miller said.

<HEAD>More Than Half of Federal Judges Now Reagan Appointees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's drive to remake the
judiciary in his own conservative image moved fitfully through the
100th Congress, but at session's end, his nominees filled more than
half the federal court seats in America.
   Reagan lost the bruising battle to send Robert H. Bork to the
Supreme Court, after senators rejected the nominee's rigid
ideological views _ especially his opinion that the Constitution
does not explicitly grant a right of privacy.
   But Reagan later won 97-0 confirmation for low-key Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, who may well rule as conservatively as Bork.
   And while Senate Republicans accused Democrats of stalling
Reagan judicial nominees, the president saw the 100th Congress
confirm 91 of 110 selections to U.S. courts.
   The 19 nominees not confirmed compared to 17 in the presidential
year of 1980, when Democrats controlled the Senate and the White
House, and 16 in the presidential year of 1984 when Republicans
controlled the Senate and the White House.
   The president has had a longstanding goal of replacing liberal
judges with conservatives. His nominees now constitute 384 of the
nation's 752 federal judges on full-time status.
   To the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the 100th
Congress set new standards for close scrutiny of judicial nominees.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said his panel sent future
presidents the message that senators have the right to go beyond
traditional questions about a Supreme Court nominee's character.
   The Senate made clear in the Bork nomination, he said, that it
can consider whether a nominee's views are ``philosophically
appropriate for the times.''
   Bork was defeated by the Senate, 58-42, in October 1987 after
furious campaigns by his supporters and opponents. The battle was
fought out on television in committee hearings, paid commercials
and floor sessions.
   But Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, now
agree that the Reagan nominees who were confirmed by the Senate are
having a significant impact on the court system.
   ``It's very difficult for minorities or women to win affirmative
action cases when Reagan appointees control the court as they do in
many circuits now,'' said law professor Herman Schwartz of American
University, referring to the U.S. courts of appeals.
   ``In the District of Columbia circuit, a lot of environmental
cases are being thrown out on grounds of standing.''
   Schwartz, a former Democratic staffer on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, predicted that until the Supreme Court rules on major
abortion cases, Reagan appellate court nominees will generally
uphold ``many of the obstacles state and local governments throw
up'' to make abortions more difficult.
   Schwartz noted that two Reagan nominees on the District of
Columbia Circuit constituted the majority on an appellate panel
that ruled the independent counsel law violated the Constitution _
the Reagan administration's position.
   The Supreme Court reversed them 7-1, thus upholding the law that
allows a court-appointed counsel to investigate and prosecute top
government officials. Justice Kennedy did not participate.
   Patrick McGuigan, a conservative and senior scholar at the Free
Congress Center for Law and Democracy, said ``the picture you get
of Reagan's 50 percent is that half are principled conservatives,
and the remaining range from so-so to outright turkeys.''
   McGuigan, who believes judges should ``honor the Constitution
and legislative intent, not the liberal agenda,'' said that
one-quarter of the federal judiciary is now ``strict construction
conservatives opposed in every fiber of their being to judicial
lawmaking.''
   McGuigan said another quarter to a third of the judiciary is
generally conservative _ but can be swayed by ``clever lawyering.''
   ``The remainder are committed judicial activists, a number of
them very capable, highly intelligent and assertive,'' he said.
   Nan Aron, co-chair of the Alliance For Justice _ an organization
of public interest legal groups _ credits the Democratic-led
Judiciary Committee with exercising ``more scrutiny'' than when the
panel was under GOP control.
   She said the long committee debate over Bork ``set in motion a
much larger public debate over the role of the courts.''
   ``In many people's minds, it established thresholds for
standards below which nominees wouldn't be confirmed. Nominees were
judged not only on their quality and integrity, but their judicial
philosophy, and what they think the role of the courts are,'' she
said.
   ``Since Reagan transformed the bench in an unprecedented
fashion, the committee will be very sensitive toward confirming
people with clearly defined political views or ideological views.''

   War and famine have turned Sudan, Africa's
largest nation, into a vast morgue. Besides the dead there are the
uprooted, seeking food where there is none. Here is a report on the
situation.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hyenas crept into the town at night,
dragged away emaciated corpses and devoured them in the bush. The
starving residents who remained alive were too weak to bury the
dead.
   About 3,000 people have died of starvation since July at the
town called Abyei in southwestern Sudan, an area of despair
afflicted by civil war and famine.
   Abyei's dead are among at least 250,000 people who foreign
relief officials say have died this year of starvation or
inadequate medical care. Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi claims the
estimate is 20 times the actual figure.
   Abyei was unknown to the world until the United States announced
a $1 million program this month to fly 90 tons of grain over a
10-day period to the town 500 miles southwest of Khartoum.
   Drought and five years of civil war have made famine endemic to
three Sudanese provinces south of Abyei.
   U.S. officials decided on the relief program because of reports
of mass starvation in the town, which had been overrun by thousands
driven from their homes by the war.
   The U.N. Children's Fund joined in with special high-protein
food for children. UNICEF officials say the relief programs saved
5,000 children from certain death.
   Videotape brought from the town last week showed children with
heads too large for their shrunken bodies. Many had the sunken eyes
and dull orange hair of extreme malnutrition.
   Cole Dodge, a UNICEF representative, told reporters after
returning from Abyei: ``Even an intensive care unit in New York
would find it hard to save these kids, some are so far gone.''
   Western and Sudanese relief officials said 2 million southerners
have been turned into refugees by fighting between government
soldiers and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. They say
about 1.3 million of those were forced from their homes this year.
   Some set out on foot for northern Sudan, others for Ethiopia to
the east. Many died on the way. Those who made it to other parts of
Sudan found little food.
   Relief workers who flew to Abyei with the airlift gave this
description:
   Grass and shrubs cover the narrow airstrip because of the
heaviest summer rains since 1946, which turned Abyei into a virtual
island and trapped 30,000-40,000 people with only enough food for
15,000.
   Most were old men, women and children because strong men were
fighting in the civil war.
   Refugees arrived in Abyei with accounts of trudging through
swampland for weeks, eating leaves and being attacked by rebel
bands who took what little food and clothing the victims had.
   Some Western relief workers say the rebels are trying to make
people move north, creating problems for the government in
Khartoum. The rebels seek greater autonomy from the
Moslem-dominated north for southern Sudan, most of whose people are
Christian or animist.
   The first U.S.-chartered planes arrived Oct. 13 in Abyei, which
consists of 12-15 permanent structures and thousands of huts built
of sticks and grass.
   Feeble-looking men came to the twin-engine Cessna in ragged
shorts and tattered remnants of flowing robes.
   Relief officials say the 90 tons of supplies and the UNICEF food
for children should last until the rainy season ends in about two
weeks and trucks can reach Abyei again. But they fear about 50,000
more refugees also may arrive then.
   Families get weekly allotments of grain. The Red Crescent, the
Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross, handles distribution.
   Videotapes from Abyei show children aged 4-10 crowding the
UNICEF feeding quarters with bowls to receive a porridge-like food
called Unimix from huge containers.
   The children are fed three times a day. They sit in the dusty,
walled-in yard under shades of grass and bamboo, some smiling and
chatting, others slowly eating from wooden or plastic bowls,
scraping up every remaining bit with their fingers.
   UNICEF officials believe many children died on the way to Abyei
or before the food came. They said the number of adults at Abyei
should have many more children than the 5,000 in the town.
   ``People are just completely emaciated. It was a situation of
absolute destitution,'' Dodge said.
   UNICEF officials say the summer estimate of 80 deaths a day in
Abyei was reduced to 10 daily this month. They say the rate appears
even lower in the latter part of October.
   No clear picture is available of the situation in the war-torn
regions of Bahr el-Ghazal, Equatoria and Upper Nile.
   Relief officials and reporters cannot get into many parts of the
war zone, where the rebels control about 90 percent of the
countryside.

<HEAD>Electronics Advances Central to Cheaper Star Wars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers in the Star Wars program say
progress in miniaturized electronics is central to the Pentagon's
recent estimate that the first phase of an anti-missile defense
system would cost $69 billion rather than a previously forecast
$115 billion.
   To illustrate the point, John P. Peller of Rockwell
International removes his tie clip and shows visitors that it is
actually an ``accelerometer,'' a measuring and computing device
that 20 years ago would have filled a small room.
   ``We feel that we will have achieved success when we can bring
all the hardware in the program in our tie tacks,'' said Peller, a
Rockwell vice president in charge of the company's program to
develop space-based weapons designed to smash enemy missiles.
   Dozens of engineers and scientists involved in Star Wars,
formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, made similar
points, showing off tiny devices that are a fraction of cost, size
and weight of earlier generations of technology.
   Mass producing them in the quantities needed for Star Wars would
drastically cut costs, the same way it has cut the prices of
consumer electronic devices such as computers and stereo systems.
   Among the cost and size reductions cited by Peller were an
inertial measurement unit, down from 40 pounds and $70,000 to six
ounces and $8,000, and a rocket thruster down from 19 pounds and
$150,000 in the 1960s to one-tenth of a pound and $20,000 today.
   Reduced weight means that a system is easier and cheaper to
launch and keep in orbit.
   And in an era of tight budgets, a $69 billion program may be
easier to sell than one costing twice that.
   But the drop in the estimated price has not calmed Capitol Hill
fears that Star Wars will not work.
   Rep. John M. Spratt, D-S.C., of the House Armed Services
Committee said he was unsure that ``costs can be cut by half
without eroding performance.''
   ``This system might actually be more fragile'' than the earlier,
costlier system, Spratt said during an Oct. 6 hearing at which SDI
officials explained the change.
   Furthermore, deployment of space-based defenses would break the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and unless it is part of a
detailed arms control framework, would unleash a new round in the
arms race as the superpowers hurried to deploy defensive as well as
offensive weapons.
   Reagan administration officials say SDI research, funded at $4.1
billion for fiscal 1989, will allow a decision in the mid-1990s on
whether to develop an anti-missile defense, with deployment in the
late 1990s or early 21st century.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has acknowledged that the
Soviets are working on a parallel program. Pentagon analysts say
that the Soviets are spending billion of rubles annually on
anti-missile defenses, and are ahead in such areas as laser
development.
   After President Reagan launched SDI in March 1983, public debate
centered on whether exotic defenses such as lasers could form a
defensive umbrella to protect the continental United States from
Soviet missiles.
   The $69 billion system outlined by scientists and engineers is
considerably less ambitious, and has the goal of knocking down
about 30 percent of the Soviets' more than 10,000 warheads, denying
them the certainty of being able to destroy the U.S. nuclear
arsenal in a ``bolt from the blue'' attack.
   Scientists and engineers at the national weapons laboratories,
Rockwell and other defense contractors are hard at work developing
a two-tier system which would include one layer of anti-missile
missiles based on the ground and another parked aboard satellites
in low orbit, less than 180 miles high.
   Edward Teller, the atomic physicist credited with planting the
seed of SDI in Reagan's mind, was initially skeptical of the
so-called ``kinetic kill vehicles'' which destroy warheads by
running into them. He had originally called for a space-based
defense using more exotic technology, in particular the X-ray
laser, powered by nuclear weapons exploded in space.
   But now Teller is leaning toward a kinetic, or collision, system
which would rely neither on nuclear weapons nor on nuclear reactors
in space.
   ``Progress in miniaturization, in the development of good
sensors, and in the realm of advanced computation, this made it
possible to make the kinetic energy component small and less
expensive,'' said Teller, 80, known as the father of the hydrogen
bomb.
   The Pentagon's current plans for a Phase One deployment, Teller
said in an interview, would be an important ``gateway'' to a more
complete and advanced system later.
   The first elements of the system to go into orbit will be about
10 Boost Surveillance and Tracking Systems (BSTS), Air Force
satellites costing about $400 million apiece. Starting in the
mid-1990s, these satellites are expected to perform a variety of
reconnaissance and communications missions not immediately linked
to Star Wars, said Mel R. Brashears, head of the BSTS program at
the Lockheed missiles and space company in Sunnyvale, Calif.
   If Congress and the administration agree to deploy an
anti-missile system, more BSTS satellites can be added to give
early warning of Soviet rocket launches, said Brashears.
   The current Pentagon vision of an anti-missile defense involves
two more satellite complexes. The Space Surveillance and Tracking
System (SSTS), orbiting several thousand miles above the earth,
would relay more detailed information on enemy boosters to another
lower complex, 147 satellites each weighing about 6,600 pounds and
carrying about 10 Space-Based Interceptors.
   The SSTS would send the space-interceptor platform ``what we
call a wake-up call,'' said Peller, of Rockwell.
   Under the new lower cost plan, the weapons platforms would
surrender much of their tracking capability to the SSTS satellites
and to the interceptors themselves.
   But that worries some critics who note that because there are
fewer SSTS, they will make an easier target for Soviet weapons.
   In addition to the space-based interceptors and sensors, the
United States would also build an undisclosed number of facilities
to launch ground-based anti-missile missiles. These would hit
warheads above 300,000 feet in altitude, as the bombs begin their
final descent.
   Lockheed officials hope to fly a prototype in 1990 and to drop
the cost for each of the estimated 3,000 missiles to $1 million a
copy, down from the current projected cost of $10 million apiece,
said Rex Hahn, an engineer at the corporation's sprawling facility
in Sunnyvale.

   Iran's efforts to restore normal
relations with the rest of the world have gathered momentum in
recent weeks, but there appears no attempt to achieve a
rapprochement with the United States.
   France and Canada have restored relations with the Tehran
government and there are moves to restore links with the countries
of Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the Persian Gulf. That
includes Saudi Arabia, Iran's main rival in the Moslem world.
   ``There is no reason for us to quarrel with the countries in the
south of the Persian Gulf,'' Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
declared recently.
   Saudi Arabia, whose population is predominantly Sunni Moslem,
severed relations with Iran, dominated by the rival Shiite sect,
last April, citing terorrism and subversion.
   To restore ties with the United States, ``the Great Satan,''
would climax Iran's widening links with the outside world. But it
remains a distant prospect.
   The United States severed relations nine years ago when the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran was stormed and diplomats held hostage for 444
days.
   ``We can see no reason to reserve a special place for the United
States,'' Mohammad Javad Larijani, deputy foreign minister for U.S.
and European affairs, said in a recent interview with Tehran's
Resaalat daily.
   ``We have done without it for the last 10 years and can do
without it for another 100 years.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini stressed earlier this month that as
long as he lives there will be no deviation from the ideals of the
Islamic revolution, including dealings with ``the criminal Soviets
and world-devouring America.''
   Nonetheless, in recent months, Tehran has restored relations
with France after a year's rift and with Canada, which closed its
Tehran embassy in 1980 after its diplomats sheltered several
Americans and smuggled them to safety.
   The Iranians are discussing normalizing relations with Britain,
frozen a year ago, have opened an embassy in New Zealand, are
upgrading relations with the Dutch, Italians and West Germans and
seeking to improve ties with the East bloc.
   The Iranians are also normalizing relations with Kuwait that
were all but severed during the 8-year-old war with Iraq, when the
northern gulf state was a target for Iranian missiles and saboteurs.
   Rafsanjani, the most powerful figure in Iran after Khomeini, is
the main architect of Iran's new foreign policy.
   Khomeini clearly had given Rafsanjani's foreign policy his
blessing, but the quickening pace of the speaker's bridge-building
has alarmed Tehran's radicals. Khomeini's strictures earlier this
month appeared to be a caution to Rafsanjani to tread warily.
   Iran's isolation because of the Islamic revolution's fierce
anti-Western ideology and support for terrorism by fundamentalist
Shiite Moslems cost it dearly during the gulf war.
   Rafsanjani, aided by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, began
opening doors two years ago.
   But his efforts gathered momentum after the Tehran government,
at his urging, unconditionally accepted a United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire July 18 following a string of military defeats by Iraq.
   The cease-fire, which took effect Aug. 20, triggered an intense
debate in Tehran over how to tackle the massive task of postwar
reconstruction, and how far Iran should go in opening its doors to
foreign capital to pay for it.
   President Ali Khamanei declared last month: ``We have bitter
experience of foreign investment in our country. But this will not
be an obstacle to countries wanting to have healthy trade and
economic relations with us.''
   He and Rafsanjani have stressed that Iran's revolutionary ideals
must not be jeopardized by opening up to foreign imports and
companies to revive the war-battered economy.
   But they recognize that Iran's 50 million people are weary of
wartime austerity and that Tehran needs foreign money to rebuild
its economy and create jobs.
   Hardline radicals, such as Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and
Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, insist on limited foreign
intervention and tight state control of the economy.
   ``A completely open-door policy is out of the question,'' Musavi
said in an interview with the London-based Middle East Economic
Digest, his first with a Western publication.
   Rafsanjani has not changed the direction of Iran's foreign
policy because he has any great love for the West. But economic,
political and military imperatives apparently convinced him that
the revolution's long-term prospects of survival lay in ending the
war and reaching out to the world.
   Musavi tried to resign in August, claiming among other things
that Rafsanjani and others did not consult him on foreign policy.
Khomeini ordered him to stop rocking the boat.
   U.S. officials have said Washington is prepared to discuss
restoring relations with Tehran once it stops supporting terrorism
and the nine American hostages in Lebanon are freed.
   But Rafsanjani must move cautiously because of widespread
hostility toward the United States, fueled by its naval
intervention in the Persian Gulf and the shooting down of an
Iranian airliner in July, killing all 290 people aboard.
   Larijani said in the Resaalat interview, ``If the Americans
change their hostile policies and opt for mutual respect and
non-intervention in Iranian affairs, our relations with the United
states will be like those with any other country.''

   A storm that threatened to grow
into a hurricane for the second time skirted Central America's
Pacific coast Sunday and El Salvador declared a state of emergency.
   Hurricane Joan, which was renamed tropical storm Miriam on
Sunday when it weakened after sweeping across Nicaragua from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, killed more than 100 people over the past
week as it churned along the Caribbean coast.
   It thrashed Nicaragua on Saturday and Sunday, killing at least
50 people and leaving some 300,000 homeless.
   The storm's 125 mph winds weakened to tropical-storm strength
along the way. But when it reached the warm waters of the Pacific
it began to strengthen again and move up the coast to Honduras and
El Salvador.
   Forecasters gave it a new name, Miriam, from the 1988 list for
Pacific storms and said it could become the first Atlantic
hurricane to gain the same status in the Pacific.
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Miriam was about 50 miles south-southeast of San
Salvador, with maximum sustained winds of about 55 mph, according
to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. The storm
was moving in a west-northwestly direction at almost 10 mph.
   ``It almost looks like a hurricane now,'' said forecaster Randy
Lascody. ``As soon as it got over the water offshore, it started to
strengthen again.''
   In El Salvador, the government declared a nationwide state of
emergency and evacuations were ordered in flood-prone areas of the
southeast.
   ``Honduras may be getting some of the fringe effects. It
eventually will get up to Guatemala, maybe southern Mexico,'' said
Lascody.
   That would mean Miriam-Joan would create havoc in every country
in Central America except Belize. Early last week, it also caused
deaths and destruction in Colombia and Venezuela.
   Lascody said he believed that only three Atlantic storms in the
past 100 years made it to tropical storm status in the Pacific, and
none made it to hurricane strength.
   Hurricane Joan left a tremendous trail of destruction through
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela.
   Heavy rain continued to fall in western Nicaragua and
northwestern Costa Rica, while rain began falling in southwestern
Honduras and southeastern El Salvador.
   Roads were closed, crops damaged and communications cut
throughout the area, especially in Nicaragua.
   In Costa Rica, authorities said 1,500 homes were destroyed, six
hospitals and health centers severely damaged and 55,000 people
were evacuated. Schools and universities were to remain closed
Monday.
   Panamanian officials said 2,000 people were left homeless and
the Pan-American Highway remained closed in Panama for a third day
because of mudslides.
   The Panamanian government loaned two helicopters to Costa Rica
to help rescue flood victims.

<TEXT>
   To hear George Bush tell it, Democrat Michael
Dukakis is against every new weapons system ``since the
slingshot.'' From the Dukakis perspective, Bush was winking and
nodding while Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega went wild dealing
drugs.
   Both assertions are part of Campaign '88, and neither bears much
relation to provable fact.
   But they typify a campaign in which befuddled voters are
bombarded with negative campaign information and are faced with a
nearly impossible task of sorting out fact from distortion,
half-truth and flat-out fiction.
   ``I don't recall an election where the ads have been as negative
as this year,'' said political analyst William Schneider of the
American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ``If things aren't
going too badly, and the election looks like it's going to be
close, they've got to have something to talk about. So they talk
about each other.''
   Most recently, Dukakis was angrily displaying campaign
literature mailed out by the state Republican Party in Illinois,
which he called ``political garbage.'' The brochure alleged that
Dukakis, ``let murderers, rapists and child molesters free on
weekend passes'' and suggested that in Dukakis' home state of
Massachusetts, Illinois mass murderer John Wayne Gacy, now on death
row, would be allowed to go free.
   The Bush campaign disavowed any connection with the fliers,
which cite the case of murderer Willie Horton who escaped while on
a weekend furlough from Massachusetts prison, then raped a Maryland
woman and slashed her boyfriend.
   Dukakis aides said Gacy would have been ineligible for release
under terms of the furlough program, which has since been amended.
   Schneider said the candidates ``are careful about outright
lying,'' but that in an era of complex issues, the advertisements
and campaign slogans ``become more and more simpleminded.''
   For instance, Dukakis ads claim Bush ``personally cast the
tie-breaking vote to cut Social Security benefits.''
   But in reality, that 1985 vote by Bush as vice president was not
to cut Social Security, but to temporarily freeze Social Security
cost-of-living increases as part of a broad budget resolution.
Dukakis, as a member of the National Governors' Conference, had
voted in favor of the same thing as part of a package of economic
recommendations. But Dukakis said he had first fought
unsuccessfully to exempt Social Security from the federal budget
freeze.
   The Democrats also like to zing Bush on drugs by linking him to
Panama's Noriega, who is currently under indictment on federal drug
charges.
   A Dukakis ad states that Bush ``was made responsible for
stopping drug traffic from coming into this country,'' a reference
to Bush's chairmanship of the South Florida Drug Interdiction Task
Force.
   ``What happened?'' the ad goes on. ``Cocaine traffic up 300
percent. More drugs in our classrooms. And Panamanian drug lord
Noriega kept on the government payroll.''
   There has been no proof that Bush knew about Noriega's drug
connections before the Justice Department indicted him, and Bush
has denied any such knowledge. He counters allegations that the CIA
under the Reagan-Bush administration kept Noriega on the CIA
payroll by stating it was that same administration which indicted
the Panamanian.
   Dukakis is particularly miffed about Bush's claim that he
opposes new weapons systems. In his strategy to portray his
Democratic rival as soft on defense, Bush often says on the stump
that Dukakis has opposed every weapons system since the slingshot,
and did not support President Reagan's invasion of Grenada or his
air attack on Libya.
   Dukakis says he did not oppose the Libya and Grenada actions.
Furthermore, he says he supports various new military technology
including the Stealth bomber and the Trident 2 sea-based missile,
as well as development of a new advanced tactical fighter and
nuclear attack submarines.
   Bush also has assailed Dukakis for his state's program to
furlough prisoners. Bush neglects to note that the furlough system
was installed by a Republican governor who preceded Dukakis.
   Dukakis responds by stating that other states and the federal
government also have furlough programs under which criminals have
escaped and committed further violent crimes, including California
under the governorship of Ronald Reagan.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha's
National Party, on a 40-year winning streak, is on the defensive
against a far-right onslaught heading into nationwide local
elections Wednesday.
   Conservative Party leaders are confident of extensive gains as
they promote plans to roll back modest racial reforms of recent
years. Their vision of the future would subject blacks to curfews,
increased evictions, even segregated elevators.
   Blacks as well as whites are eligible to vote for segregated
municipal councils, but ideology is not a significant factor in the
black elections. The issue is how many people heed the government's
exhortations to vote despite calls for a boycott by anti-apartheid
activists.
   Even if the government announces a moderately high black
turnout, in the range of 30 or 40 percent, the impact on national
politics is likely to be minimal. No blacks identified with major
anti-apartheid groups are seeking office, many areas have no
contested races, and millions of black adults _ barred from
national politics _ are not registered to vote.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no voice in national
affairs, while the white minority controls the economy and
maintains separate schools and districts.
   The white elections could have a profound effect on the
country's future. A strong showing by the Conservatives _ who won
26 percent of the vote in a white general election last year _
could put them in a position to take power in the next
parliamentary election, expected by early 1990.
   The Conservatives approach Election Day ``in a supremely
confident mood,'' wrote Richard Humphries, a political analyst at
Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand. ``Party spokesmen
refer to the elections as a practice run for gaining power.''
   The Conservatives' strongholds are in the farming towns and
blue-collar urban areas of Transvaal, the most populous of the four
provinces.
   The Conservatives are given an outside chance of seizing power
in Pretoria, the administrative capital, where defeat would be a
major psychological blow to the Nationalists.
   The Conservatives want to toughen enforcement of residential
segregation and restore influx control, which restricted blacks'
presence in urban areas.
   They are campaigning on these issues even though they could not
implement the changes unless they ended the National Party's
40-year hold on national power. However, municipal councils have
the power to segregate parks, public buildings, and transportation
facilities.
   An estimated 7 million of South Africa's 26 million blacks are
shack-dwelling squatters, but the Conservative Party says they will
have to be removed from the vicinity of ``white'' cities.
   ``We are adamant that we won't allow squatters of any race,''
said Willie Snyman, an election coordinator for the Conservatives.
``They will have to go back to their place of origin.''
   Conservative candidates propose a curfew that would bar blacks
from streets in white communities after dark unless they had
permits for night jobs. They also want to segregate beaches, some
of which have been opened to all races.
   A strong Conservative Party showing could give it veto power
over the regional services councils, set up over the past two years
by the government to redistribute tax revenue to black townships.
   ``You can vote for the Conservative Party if you do not care a
damn about the black masses, if you don't care a damn about what
the rest of the world thinks,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government
paper, in a recent editorial. ``You vote for the National Party if
you believe that it is the vehicle for reform, even if it is moving
somewhat sluggishly at present.''
   Many anti-apartheid activists believe the Nationalists differ
from the Conservatives only in a superficial willingness to appear
moderate. But there is sentiment in the black community that a
racist crackdown by a Conservative government could be the catalyst
for a successful black revolt.
   Both the Conservative and National parties are dominated by
Afrikaners, the mainly Dutch-descended ethnic group that makes up
60 percent of the 5-million white population.

   Two Mexican police officers were arrested after
they offered to ship 110 pounds of heroin _ worth up to $50 million
_ to the United States each month, a Drug Enforcement
Administration spokesman said Sunday.
   ``These two defendants were using their positions in the
Acapulco region (of Mexico) to safely transport the heroin to the
United States,'' said DEA spokesman Robert Strang.
   The heroin would have been manufactured in Mexico and sent to
New York by plane, he said. A kilogram of heroin, which equals 2.2
pounds, has a street value up to $1 million.
   Agents posing as organized crime figures spoke with the men in
Mexico by telephone, and the pair flew to New York City on Friday
to complete the deal, Strang said.
   After dining with the Mexican officers Saturday night, two
undercover agents went to the mens' hotel and gave them $15,000
cash as partial payment in the proposed drug deal, Strang said.
   A surveillance team then moved in and arrested Pedro Guillen,
39, and Margaritan Villagrana, 42, he said. They are state police
officers from Guerrero, Mexico, which includes Acapulco, he said.
   They were charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin, a felony
that carries a penalty of 25 years to life in prison, Strang said.
They are scheduled to appear in state Supreme Court on Monday.

<TEXT>
   President Miguel de la Madrid's radical
streamlining of the Mexican economy has suffered many blows in the
final months of his term, but a U.S. offer of a $3.5 billion loan
may create some breathing room.
   ``Without bragging, I can declare that there is no other country
in the world that has accomplished a rationalization of its
productive apparatus as rapidly as we Mexicans have,'' said de la
Madrid, who will step down on Dec. 1 in favor of his elected
successor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   The president is optimistic that his efforts to reduce his
country's dependence on petroleum exports will boost Mexico out of
its recession, which was compounded by the drop in the price of
oil, Mexico's leading export. The price of isthmus, a major export
grade of oil, is about $11.80 per barrel, down from $13.50 in
August and $14.81 in December.
   Export growth outside the oil sector, the president argues, is
the key to Mexico's future. De la Madrid has in the past few years
gradually dismantled 40 years' worth of protectionist trade
barriers and forced domestic industry to try to become
internationally competitive.
   Foreign revenues will enable Mexico to service its $104 billion
debt and enable it to resume economic growth and development.
   De la Madrid's strategy has been rewarded with its first
successes.
   Non-petroleum export earnings through August, $9.4 billion, were
double those brought in by oil and helped cushion the impact of
depressed petroleum revenues. Manufacturing exports increased at a
20 percent annual rate the first six months of the year and are
continuing to grow.
   But de la Madrid's program also has been battered this year:
   _The plunge in oil prices cost the country $2 billion to $2{
billion in lost incom.
   _Cancun, one of Mexico's prime resorts, was devastated by
Hurricane Gilbert in September.
   _The summer drought intensified Mexico's dependence on U.S.
agricultural products and jacked up its food import bill to $1.6
billion.
   _Mexico's trade surplus shrank to 1986 levels, and most analysts
say Mexico was running a deficit last month. The trade surplus
through August was $2.5 billion, down from $6 billion in the same
period in 1987, according to government figures.
   _Foreign creditors have balked at Mexico's proposals to ease the
estimated $12 billion it must pay this year to service the foreign
debt.
   Nevertheless, the healthier export sector was cause for
celebration and the United States, Mexico's biggest trading
partner, seemed to agree.
   On Oct. 17, the northern neighbor announced a $3.5 billion loan
that will be granted only if Mexico secures long-term loans
promised by the World Bank and other financial institutions.
   The government was criticized for its willingness to increase
Mexico's foreign debt by accepting the U.S. loan at time when the
economy is in a recession partly, induced by the government to ease
inflationary pressures.
   Under a so-called Economic Solidarity Pact with labor and
business, the president in February froze the minimum wage, prices
for goods and services, and the peso-dollar currency exchange rate.
   Officially, the pact is working. Inflation dropped from a record
159.2 percent in 1987 to below 1 percent for the month of September.
   But the recession also has cost the government dearly by forcing
it to increase subsidies to state-owned firms whose incomes are
frozen. Further subsidies have been used to support the peso freeze
on currency markets and placate investor fears of a devaluation.
   Foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $16 billion in April,
dropped to $12 billion in September. Analysts said another massive
run on dollars occurred on Oct. 14, two days before President-elect
Salinas announced he would maintain the peso freeze a month into
his term.
   Cuts in government spending of $250 million announced this month
had little impact on the whopping budget deficit, which is more
than 10 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product and was
aggravated by the fall in oil revenue. In addition, tax cuts and
price freezes under the pact have aggravated the deficit.
   ``Why make the U.S. loan now? Because the government is in a
trap,'' said Jonathan Heath, director of the Macro Asesoria
economic forecasting company. ``They can't cut the deficit under
the anti-inflation program, and they can't solve inflation without
cutting the deficit.''
   On Dec. 1, Salinas will inherit the reins of the reforms he
designed as de la Madrid's budget minister.
   The president-elect faces substantial political fallout from his
disputed election in July, which opponenents claim was not honestly
conducted.
   And he has staked his claim to the presidency on a pledge to
resume economic growth, even if he must try to force concessions
from Mexico's creditors.
   It is a pledge he cannot afford to ignore _ Mexican workers have
shouldered the brunt of austerity programs for six years, and their
wages buy no more today than they did in 1964.
   ``They've done everything their creditors have asked, they've
done everything the IMF has asked, and they're still in trouble,''
Heath said.

   Hurricane Joan killed 50 people as it
crossed over Nicaragua, raising the death toll to 111 in the
storm's six-day tear through the Caribbean, officials said Sunday.
   Nicaragua authorities labored Sunday to restore communications
and care for about 300,000 homeless.
   The storm left 50 dead in Nicaragua, 21 in Costa Rica, four in
Panama, 25 in Colombia, and 11 in Venezuela on its week-long slash
along the Caribbean coast and then across Nicaragua to the Pacific
Ocean.
   Joan slowly weakened into a tropical storm over Nicaragua but
strengthened again when it reached the Pacific. No longer an
Atlantic hurricane, it was given a new name in the sequence of this
year's Pacific storms _ Tropical Storm Miriam.
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Miriam was about 50 miles south-southeast of San
Salvador, El Salvador, with maximum sustained winds of about 55
mph, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It said
the storm was moving in a west-northwesterly direction at almost 10
mph.
   Hurricane Joan blasted into the east coast Nicaraguan city of
Bluefields with 125 mph winds early Saturday and marched across the
Iowa-sized country of 3 million, leaving a trial of death and
destruction before reaching Managua, the capital, about 10 p.m.
Saturday.
   Officials said there were 21 dead in Bluefields, 180 miles east
of Managua. The city of about 38,000 was reported 90 percent
destroyed.
   Mario Tapia, an Associated Press photographer, said Sunday in
Bluefields that only a few buildings were left standing. A Red
Cross nurse told him, ``There isn't enough left of the houses to
make a fire.''
   Officials worried about food supplies and lack of sanitation
facilities. The bodies of rats littered the streets. Most of the
people in the area rely on fishing for their living, and many boats
were destroyed.
   Bluefields, Corn Island off Nicaragua's eastern coast and the
southeastern Atlantic coast region ``practically disappeared from
the map,'' the Managua daily El Nuevo Diario said Sunday.
   The storm felled trees, electrical towers and telephone lines as
it ripped into Managua.
   Throughout the capital people were cleaning mud-covered homes
Sunday while others cut up fallen trees for fuel. Soldiers carrying
picks and axes joined to clear the streets.
   A Cuban plane landed Sunday afternoon in Managua with the first
batch of help for the country, state radio reported. It said the
plane carried 35 tons of rice, condensed milk, beans and tuna.
   President Daniel Ortega, after touring the capital city of 1
million, reported that at least 50 people had died across Nicaragua
and 300,000 others had been left homeless. He gave no details.
   Many people living in riverbeds near Managua lost their homes.
Although thousands responded to repeated government pleas to
evacuate dangerous areas Julio Richardo Espinoza was one of many
who ignored the calls.
   ``We were asleep, and we felt the rain and that part of the
house just went,'' he said, looking down a 50-foot gulch at the
remains of his small wooden home.
   ``We are poor,'' said Espinoza, ``and we didn't want to leave
our things for people to come and steal.''
   The capital's population has been swollen by refugees from the
the civil war between the Sandinista government and U.S.-supported
rebels. Hundreds of thousands live in wood shacks with corrugated
zinc roofs.
   Three dead were reported on Great Corn Island in the Caribbean
east of Bluefields; seven dead in Villa Sandino, 80 miles west of
Bluefields; and one dead in Masatepe, about 30 miles east of
Managua.
   A group of 140 army soldiers reported missing earlier near Rama,
about 30 miles west of Bluefields, was located Sunday, Col. Roberto
Calderon said. Eighty soldiers were rescued from areas near flooded
rivers and 60 others had sought higher ground, he said.
   Electric power was reported out throughout the country.
Telephone service was spotty, and the only communication with the
east coast was by radio.
   Ortega, asked whether the United States should send aid,
replied, ``The best humanitarian aid the United States could give
us would be to stop its terrorist policies against Nicaragua.''
   The Maryland-based Quest for Peace, a U.S. shipper of
humanitarian aid to Nicaragua, launched a campaign Sunday to raise
$10 million in emergency aid for victims of the hurricane.

   Although the 100th Congress was one of the
most productive congressional sessions in years, it also left
behind a lengthy list of unfinished business ranging from cleaning
up the nation's air to raising the minimum wage.
   ``Much remains to be tackled,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues near the end of the session.
``The 101st Congress has some formidable challenges to address.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., agreed. ``I think it
was quite successful, overall, but there were also some things we
didn't get that we would have liked.''
   Many of the unresolved issues involve domestic policy fights,
such as the minimum wage, family-related legislation, and cleaning
up the nation's air.
   The minimum wage has been $3.35 per hour since 1981, but
Democrats pushed in recent months for an increase, a drive they
hoped to turn into political gains during the election campaign.
   The Democrats who control Congress succeeded in bringing to the
Senate floor a bill that would have raised the minimum wage to
$4.55 per hour over a three-year period, but Republicans said they
would filibuster unless the Judiciary Committee voted to approve 25
of President Reagan's judicial appointments.
   The Senate tried to cut off debate, but that move only picked up
56 votes, four short of the 60 needed. That moved minimum wage
legislation to the back burner.
   A look at some of the other unfinished items:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CLEAN AIR _ The Senate considered a bill which would have tried
to control acid rain by restricting smokestack emissions, along
with tightening auto-emission standards and restricting the burning
of toxic chemicals. But there was strong opposition in both the
House and Senate, particularly from legislators representing states
producing low-sulfur coal such as those in the Rocky Mountain area.
   CHILD CARE _ The Senate Health and Labor Committee voted
approval in July of a bill providing $2.5 billion for child care,
with 75 percent of that amount ticketed for low- and
moderate-income families. But opposition by a variety of groups,
including the National Education Association and the National
Parent Teachers Association, stalled floor action. They were
opposed because some of the money would go to child-care centers
sponsored by religious institutions.
   PARENTAL LEAVE _ Democrats backed a proposal to require
employers of 50 or more persons to give up to 10 weeks of unpaid
parental and medical leave. Senate Republicans attached an
amendment making child pornography a federal crime and Democrats
tried to strip that provision out of the bill, but failed.
   IMPEACHMENT _ The House voted 413-3 on Aug. 3 to impeach U.S.
District Court Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida for high crimes
and misdemeanors, alleging perjury and conspiracy to receive a
bribe. The Senate later decided to postpone the impeachment trial
until 1989.
   The House also delayed impeachment proceedings against U.S.
District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr., of Mississippi. Nixon is
serving a five-year prison term for perjury.
   SOUTH AFRICA SANCTIONS _ On Aug. 11, the House voted 244-132
approval of a bill to prohibit almost all trade with white-ruled
South Africa. It would have also barred South African imports. The
Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved similar legislation,
but filibuster threats blocked any floor action.
   AIRLINE CONSUMER PROTECTION _ The House approved a bill
requiring airlines to disclose information on flight delays and
compensation for workers hurt by mergers. The Senate passed a
similar bill, but a House-Senate conference committee called to
resolve differences broke down in fighting over provisions for the
random testing of transportation industry employees.
   CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM _ Senate Democrats backed a bill capping
the amount senators could receive from political action committees.
Republicans filibustered and there were eight unsuccessful votes
attempting to halt the filibuster. During one procedural fight over
the filibuster, arrest warrants were issued for missing senators
and Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., was brought forcibly to the
Senate floor.
   NUCLEAR TREATIES _ Still awaiting action are a pair of treaties
negotiated between the Soviet Union and United States more than a
decade ago. They would restrict nuclear explosions to no more than
150 kilotons. President Reagan had promised to push for
ratification if an improved method could be found to verify the
pacts.

<HEAD>Rat Control Study Begins Before Major Highway Rebuilding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of specialists has begun a two-month,
$25,000 study on how to control rats displaced by the $3.5 billion
construction project on Boston's Central Artery.
   ``It's really the first time a major project of this sort has
asked the question ahead of time: `What can we do to reduce our
pest control problem and minimize the impact?''' said William
Jackson, head of the four-member team.
   ``Usually you have rats in the mayor's office or some such
political crisis instead of looking at the problem long-range.''
   The artery, the city's major highway through downtown, is
scheduled for reconstruction underground. A third tunnel under
Boston Harbor leading to Logan International Airport also is
planned.
   ``Rat poison's not the solution to everyone's problems,''
Jackson said. ``The recommendations have to be tailored to the
environment.''
   Jackson's team intends to develop what it calls an integrated
pest management report by December.

   Farmer Bob Corbett wants Chief to
make it big, so to speak, so he feeds his 1,230-pound hog 10 cans
of beer and 30 pounds of grain a day.
   The formula is working.
   Judges at the recent Indiana State Fair told Corbett that Chief
was the biggest hog they could recall ever seeing. The hog is
represented by a lawyer from Urbana, gets as much as $700 for
appearances at county fairs and has been on ``Late Night with David
Letterman.''
   Corbett, 65, quit his job as a prison guard to devote full time
to Chief, who was born one of a litter of 11 six years ago.
   ``He had a big neck, a lot of bone and a rear end as rough as a
washboard. Plenty of loose skin to grow into,'' Corbett said. ``I
knew right then I had me a good one.''
   At six months, he weighed 300 pounds _ 75 pounds more than any
of his siblings. By the time he was 4, he had won the Buckeye Big
Boar title at the state fair.
   Corbett credits some body-builder magazines he read three years
ago and an old veterinary book that said a hog's digestive system
is similar to man's.
   ``All you need is a diet with plenty of protein and
carbohydrates, a little exercise and a hog could put weight on just
like one of them body builders,'' he said.
   Chief's menu includes corn, steamed barley, oats, rolled oats,
alfalfa meal, soybean meal, commercially prepared meat scraps and
molasses, all washed down by beer to thin his blood and prevent
kidney stones. On the rare occasions when Chief doesn't have an
appetite, Corbett will mix in a bottle of Pepto-Bismol.
   Corbett takes Chief on two half-mile hikes every day during the
summer and has him X-rayed regularly to make sure fat isn't
building up around his heart.

   About 100,000 people lined the banks of
the Charles River for the world's largest one-day rowing regatta,
but all of them didn't have their eyes on the boats.
   Stephanie Forte of New Jersey, a student at Bentley College in
Waltham, spoke for many when she listed her top priority: ``I'm
enthusiastic about the guys around here.''
   Kathi-Ann O'Leary, another Bentley student, conceded that she
knew nothing about rowing. ``It's more important to be here and
meet lots of people,'' she said.
   Despite a heavy presence of police and alcohol, spectators at
Sunday's annual Head-of-the-Charles Regatta got along well with
officers.
   ``Does anyone want to claim ownership of this bag?'' Officer
Frank O'Brien asked spectators while holding up a jug.
   As O'Brien dumped the tomato-red liquid into a trash can, a
group of spectators began chanting, ``Sha Na Na Na, Hey Hey, bye
bye.''
   O'Brien returned to the group, grinned, held up the empty bottle
and said, ``You're the nicest people we've taken alcohol from all
day.''
   The spectators included a group of campers from Newton who
brought an 8-foot-long hoagie, a sandwich that put the camp in the
spirit of the day by resembling a heavyweight shell.
   Regarded as the nation's premier rowing event, the
Head-of-the-Charles drew more than 3,500 competitors from across
the country as well as England, France, Switzerland, Mexico, Peru,
Hong Kong and East and West Germany. The races cover a three-mile
course from Boston to Cambridge.

   A surfer who was attacked and badly
gashed by a 7-foot shark during a weekend competition said today
that he eventually turned the creature away by repeatedly punching
it in the snout.
   John Wonham's right leg required 31 stitches after Saturday's
attack, which the surfer said would not keep him from returning to
the ocean.
   ``They (sharks) won't keep me away from the water,'' he said.
``Surfing can be dangerous, but its very unusual for sharks to
attack like that.''
   Wonham, a surfer for 20 years, was attacked during a veteran's
long board competition off Phillip Island in the state of Victoria.
   The 38-year-old Wonham said he struck the shark repeatedly with
his fists.
   ``The shark just came at me from behind,'' Wonham told
reporters. ``It was hanging on to my leg and I just wanted to get
it away from me. I knocked it on the head and kicked at it. It
didn't come back.''
   ``I'm quite lucky. I could have lost an arm or a leg,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A company is harvesting a steady year-round
crop of spinach from seeds germinated in tiny polyester blankets,
unaffected by the vagaries of the weather and nourished without
soil or sunshine.
   This spinach feeds on a stream of liquid nutrients and grows
during the night under the light of 1,000-watt bulbs. The
manufacturer says its method works better than Mother Nature.
   ``It is a quality product and it commands a quality price, but
it has no competition after you've tasted it,'' said Kevin Wallick,
plant scientist for the manufacturer, Phytofarms of America.
   Rain or shine, the company's 50,000-square-foot production
center turns out a weekly crop of 10,000 pounds of spinach, along
with smaller quantities of lettuce, basil, dill and the expensive
and nutty-flavored arugula.
   These products of hydroponics _ agriculture without soil _ are
shipped to gourmet restaurants and supermarkets from Washington
state to New York and from Texas to Canada.
   The produce is more tender than the field-grown variety, Wallick
said. It's also clean and safe because it has never been in soil or
sprayed with pesticides, he added. There's a dependable harvest
every weekday of the year.
   As a result, customers pay five times the price of conventional
greens for the company's crops, Wallick said.
   A four-ounce bag of the company's Kitchen Harvest spinach, its
main product, retails for $1.98. One Illinois grocery store was
offering garden-variety spinach for 89 cents a pound.
   General Mills built Phytofarms' plant in 1978 for about $10
million. Noel Davis, a pioneer in the design of agricultural growth
chambers, directed the project and then bought the business in 1982.
   Company officials believe the concept will attract growing
interest from consumers worried about pesticide residue and regions
where the weather is adverse for conventional agriculture.
Inquiries have come from Canada, Japan and the Soviet Union, the
officials say.
   Officials say the plant produces 100 times the volume of lettuce
per acre as conventional agriculture, and nearly six times as much
produce per acre as a greenhouse.
   The lights come on at 10 p.m. each night at the center.
   ``The plants don't grow according to their own physiology, they
grow in response to utility rates, which go down at night and go
out of sight during the day,'' said Davis.
   The center located 60 miles west of Chicago has 15 growth
chambers, each covered on all sides by shiny silver shades.
   Seeds are nestled in soft blankets that absorb water and placed
in small plastic cubes, about an inch square. After the seeds
germinate, the cubes are placed over an opening in a conduit that
carries liquid nutrients to the plants' roots.
   Each patented light bulb is surrounded by a water-filled globe
that captures the heat and keeps the crops from getting scorched.
In winter, the captured heat is redistributed to warm the building,
greatly lowering energy costs.
   The 18-foot-long aluminum conduits that hold the plants lie
across a long table in each chamber and rotate slowly and
automatically from the front of the chamber after planting to the
back for harvest. It takes just 28 days for each conduit to pass
down the roughly 150-foot chamber and bring its crop to harvest.
   ``The crop comes to the workers rather than having the workers
crawling on their hands and knees to get to the crop,'' said
Wallick.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush both oppose
oil import fees to help the depressed U.S. oil industry, one of the
few areas of energy policy on which the presidential candidates
agree.
   In interviews last week, Dukakis adviser Jack Riggs and Bush
adviser William Martin said the next president will have to make
tradeoffs between energy and the environment.
   ``There is almost always going to be a conflict between some of
our energy policies and some of our environmental policies,'' said
Riggs, majority staff director of the energy and power subcommittee
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Martin, a former deputy energy secretary, said, ``We're going to
find instances where energy security objectives and environmental
objectives are going to go head to head against each other.''
   They were interviewed for a radio program, ``Energy Update,''
whose tapes are produced by Americans for Energy Independence, a
study organization supported by unions, companies and others
interested in a strong domestic energy supply. The tapes will be
broadcast in the two weeks before the election.
   There are both differences and similarities between the
candidates.
   Some differences:
   _Bush favors exploration of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
in Alaska, a good drilling prospect. Dukakis opposes it.
   _Dukakis would keep motor vehicle mileage standards but opposes
standards that ``directly cause a major penalty to the U.S.
economy.'' Bush would drop the standards.
   Some similarities:
   _Both candidates favor tax incentives to encourage domestic oil
production and oppose new tariffs, sometimes called ``import fees.''
   _Both oppose other energy taxes, such as higher gasoline taxes
or a levy on the carbon content of fuels, at the moment. Dukakis
would consider them if new revenue were needed, but would resist
taxes that would hurt one segment of the industry more than another.
   _Both expect and favor major growth in natural gas as an energy
source.
   Some shadings:
   _Bush believes in nuclear power but recognizes ``it does have a
problem of public confidence and safety.'' Dukakis believes ``we
cannot even begin to consider promoting nuclear power as part of
our energy mix'' without a new generation of safer reactors, a
solution to the waste disposal problem and stronger safety
oversight.
   Opposition from Dukakis has helped prevent the startup of a
nuclear plant in New Hampshire just over the state line.
   Dukakis believes the nation needs a ``core supply'' of domestic
oil production, currently about 8.2 million barrels a day or 9
percent below the decade's peak year of 1985. Some 300,000 jobs
have been lost since then.
   ``I have not seen anything from Gov. Dukakis that would try to
put that in barrels per day or a percentage of our energy needs,''
Riggs said.
   Dukakis opposes a higher tariff because it is ``a tremendously
inefficient way to raise revenue and a tremendously inefficient way
to help energy industries,'' Riggs said. ``It would help domestic
energy industries by putting huge burdens on farmers and business
and consumers.''
   Martin was principal author of a departmental report last year
concluding a major oil tariff would cost the economy almost three
times as many jobs as it would restore to the domestic oil industry.
   ``While some energy objectives might be realized through taxes _
in the case of a gasoline tax you might conserve more; in the case
of an import fee we might produce more _ the fact is there is a
penalty on the economy as a whole,'' Martin said.
   Martin said tax incentives favored by Bush could increase
production by 600,000 barrels a day and cost $600 million in annual
tax revenue.

<HEAD>U.S. Trial May Solve Problem Of Where To Try Marcos, Retrieve
Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. indictment of Ferdinand
Marcos spares the Philippines from risking political instability by
charging the former president with crimes and allowing him to
return for the trial.
   On Friday, a federal grand jury in New York indicted Marcos and
his wife Imelda on racketeering charges for allegedly looting more
than $100 million from their homeland to buy real estate and other
properties in New York.
   It was the first time Marcos had been charged with any crime
despite widespread allegations of corruption during his 20-year
administration.
   Philippine authorities conceded that prospects for retrieving
the billions of dollars Marcos allegedly embezzled were bleak
unless the ousted president were formally charged with crimes.
   But the Philippine Constitution bans trials in absentia, and
Marcos made it clear he would demand to return from exile in Hawaii
and conduct his own defense.
   The Philippine military warned civilian authorities that Marcos'
thousands of die-hard followers would use the return of their
former leader to stage demonstrations and other ``destabilization''
acts.
   Marcos supporters are blamed for some of the six major coup
attempts against President Corazon Aquino. Several alleged
ringleaders, including former Brig. Gen. Jose Maria Zumel and
former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan, remain at large.
   Filipino officials also said they would face a monumental task
in preventing Marcos' enemies from assassinating him. That would
have raised the horrific specter of a repeat of the Aug. 21, 1983,
slaying of Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., who was
killed while under military guard just as he returned from the
United States to challenge Marcos' rule.
   Following Friday's indictment, Ramon Diaz, former chairman of
the Presidential Commission on Good Government, said the American
legal moves will save the Philippines a lot of trouble and
``achieve what we wanted to do'' _ retrieve Marcos' alleged stolen
riches.
   U.S. officials have said any funds proven embezzled would be
returned to the rightful owner _ presumably the Philippine
government.
   The dilemma posed by the need to maintain stability and the
desire the retrieve Marcos' alleged ``ill-gotten wealth'' has
dogged the Aquino administration since it took office Feb. 25, 1986
after a popular uprising toppled Marcos.
   In June, Swiss authorities made clear they would not lift
banking secrecy laws covering Marcos' alleged secret accounts in
Switzerland in the absence of a criminal case.
   For years, the Philippine government struggled to find a
solution to the dilemma.
   In 1987, Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez proposed the
government ask the United States to allow the Philippine
anti-corruption court to try Marcos in Hawaii, where he fled after
the 1986 uprising.
   U.S. officials successfully lobbied strongly against the plan.
American sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
urged Filipino authorities not to make a formal request because it
would surely be rejected to the embarrassment of both governments.
   Officials also considered holding the trial at a remote resort
on the Bataan peninsula, which could be sealed off.
   But that scheme too was scrapped because it would surely have
raised charges by Marcos supporters that the government was
conducting the same ``secret trial'' for which the former president
was condemned.
   Mrs. Aquino has said repeatedly that her government will
eventually file charges against Marcos. The government has filed 39
civil suits against Marcos to recover $16 billion in damages, but
no trial dates have been set.
   Diaz told The Associated Press that in June, military Chief of
Staff Gen. Renato de Villa recommended no charges be filed until at
least the first three months of 1989 to avoid risking political
instability by a Marcos return.

<HEAD>Romer Denies Request to Expand Waste Storage at Nuclear Weapons
Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Roy Romer on Sunday denied a
Department of Energy request to expand low-level radioactive waste
storage at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant.
   Romer made his decision as a railcar, loaded with Rocky Flats
wastes and turned back from a temporary storage site in Idaho on
order of Idaho Gov. Cecil D. Andrus, was returning to the nuclear
weapons plant 16 miles northwest of Denver.
   Andrus has banned furthur shipments of such wastes to the
storage site in his state.
   ``I met with DOE and they said, `Would you expand the
authorization to store (at Rocky Flats)?' And my answer was `No!,'
'' Romer said. ``That's about as clear as you can get.
   ``I also asked them not to unload that car but to leave it
loaded and to leave it on the track so we can work to find another
destination for it,'' he said.
   ``I said, `You an keep the authorization for storage you now
have. But I will not enlarge the storage.'''
   An interim agreement allows storage of about 1,600 cubic yards
of material at Rocky Flats. Rocky Flats has about 650 yards of
low-level waste, leaving about 950 cubic yards to go, Romer said.
   The Energy Department had planned to transfer the waste from
Idaho to New Mexico when the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a
permanent nuclear waste site near Carlsbad, N.M., opens. That site
was to have been in operation this month, but the date has been
pushed back at least until early next year.
   Romer said he did not want to authorize an increase in nuclear
waste storage because he did ``not want Colorado to be the escape
valve for everybody's failure to provide a permanent site.''
   ``I said I want to confer with other western governors so that
we can find a way to get the WIPP site in New Mexico available as
soon as possible,'' the governor said.
   Dennis Hurtt, manager of external affairs for Rockwell
International that operates Rocky Flats, expected the railcar to be
moved to the weapons plant sometime Monday.
   ``We have a spur off of the line that we ship rail materials in
and out on, and it will be moved off the line and on the Rocky
Flats spur and stored on site there until a decision is made as to
how they want to handle this whole waste storage problem.'' Hurtt
said.
   Rocky Flats makes plutonium for nuclear warheads. The plutonium
processing was recently recently after three workers were exposed
radiation.

<HEAD>Study Says B-1 Bomber Has More Maintenance Problems Than
Predecessor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force's B-1 bombers are grounded with
maintenance problems far more than the aging planes they are
supposed to replace, says a congressional study.
   The General Accounting Office study said the time that B-1s
weren't available at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas due to
maintenance problems ranged from 47 percent to 66 percent.
   For systems that have been flying longer, such as the FB-111 and
the B-52, the Air Force expects that the total of ``not mission
capable'' rates won't exceed 25 percent of the available hours.
   The Air Force responded to the figures by saying it won't have
enough experience with the B-1 until 1994 to consider the plane
``mature,'' as the FB-111 and B-52 are now considered.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, disagreed. ``When the GAO suggested standards by which
to judge the reasonableness of breakdowns, they were told the plane
isn't mature yet. But its maturity is being pushed back further by
breakdowns,'' he said.
   The GAO study, released Sunday, concludes that ``the B-1B has
not been mission capable because of maintenance a significant
percentage of the time.''
   In Air Force parlance, ``mission capable'' means the ability to
carry out an assigned job. In the case of the B-1 _ which includes
the first four prototype B-1As, which are no longer flying, and the
next generation of 100 B-1Bs _ that would mean a nuclear strike on
the Soviet Union.
   ``The Air Force says the B-1B has been ready to go to war for
two years, but when it comes to pinning the service down on some of
the plane's problems, the answer is the plane is still just a
kid,'' said Aspin, one of the plane's chief critics.
   In response, Capt. Jay DeFrank, a spokesman for the Air Force,
said, ``This weapon system is not fully mature so it is not valid
to compare it to those that are.'' He added that ``all but a few of
the B-1Bs could be launched if a wartime crisis were to occur.''
   DeFrank also said the service wanted to fly the plane more but
had been restricted by the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   ``In fiscal year 1988, Congress specifically cut the B-1 flying
hours by 30 percent,'' DeFrank said. ``The Air Force flew all
19,000 flying hours allotted and could have flown more if they had
been available.''
   The B-1 program, killed by President Carter 11 years ago after
the first four planes were built, was resurrected in 1981 by
President Reagan, who said 100 of the swing-wing planes were needed
as replacement for the aging B-52s in America's fleet of atomic
bombers. Reagan pledged that all 100 planes would be purchased by
1988 at a cost of $26 billion.
   The 100th plane was delivered last spring, but Aspin and other
critics have pointed out what they say are serious flaws in the
plane's electronic countermeasure system, the complex mix of
computers and other weapons designed to outwit Soviet defenses.
   The Air Force defends the plane as the world's most
sophisticated atomic bomber and says the countermeasure problem can
be fixed.
   Part of the plane's problem, according to the GAO, is that the
maintenance system depends, in part, on an on-board diagnostic
system that has not worked as designed. That has delayed Air Force
plans to have service personnel take over some maintenance jobs
from private contractors.
   The Air Force is also working on a better ground-based system to
figure out B-1 problems, but that program won't be ready until at
least next year, the GAO said.

   Perhaps no politician has more riding on Michael
Dukakis' White House hopes than Evelyn Murphy.
   The Massachusetts lieutenant governor would take over the Corner
Office here if Dukakis moves to the Oval Office in Washington.
   Murphy's political career has been inextricably linked to the
fortunes of Dukakis, beginning as a volunteer cutting newspaper
clippings for his first gubernatorial campaign.
   After weathering and riding that association for 14 years, the
48-year-old lieutenant governor now says she would enjoy taking
over if Dukakis wins the White House in November.
   ``Sure,'' she said. ``You don't sit here twice around as a
Cabinet secretary and as a lieutenant governor, and you don't run
for the lieutenant governor's office, unless you look at it and
think some day that it will be possible to get there.''
   For Murphy, who has always pointed to her business, academic and
later governmental credentials for her next job, there appears to
be a persistent problem with the way her motives, intentions or
actions have been interpreted in Massachusetts' charged political
atmosphere, particularly in relation to Dukakis.
   Talking to reporters in July in Atlanta when Dukakis claimed the
Democratic Party's presidential nomination, she mentioned she was
leaving the convention one day early _ the day Dukakis gave his
acceptance speech _ to ``pick up the pieces'' back in Massachusetts.
   ``It wasn't off-handed,'' she said later of the remark, ``but it
got sort of stretched out to a kind of inference about the budget''
and an uncertain revenue situation she could inherit from Dukakis.
   Murphy had virtually no political experience before business
acquaintance Howard Smith, later to become economic affairs
secretary in Dukakis' first administration, asked her to help out
with Dukakis' first gubernatorial campaign.
   ``It was literally no more than cutting newspaper articles,''
she recalled. But it got her recognized and remembered after
Dukakis won in 1974.
   Murphy, helping Dukakis fulfill a campaign promise of bringing
women into his new administration, joined his cabinet as
environmental affairs secretary even though she thought her
qualifications were better suited for secretary of economic affairs.
   Murphy holds a doctorate in economics from Duke University and
founded her own consulting firm specializing in education, health
care and municipal development.
   But when Dukakis was turned out of office by Edward King in
1978, Murphy was out of a job, too. She became a visiting lecturer
on environmental issues at the Kennedy Institute of Politics at
Harvard University, a consultant to Polaroid Corp., and the founder
of a non-profit corporation involved in hazardous waste issues.
   Then, in 1982, she made her first run for lieutenant governor.
She won the state Democratic convention endorsement, but lost the
primary to John Kerry. Political detractors would later criticize
her for remaining neutral in the Dukakis-King rematch that year.
But when Dukakis won back the governor's office he didn't hesitate
to bring her back into his administration _ this time as economic
affairs secretary.
   Murphy quit the Cabinet in late 1985 to run again for lieutenant
governor. This time she won the election, but along the way
suffered what she considers her most painful political defeat _
narrowly losing the Democratic convention endorsement to former
state Sen. Gerard D'Amico.
   Various factors have been given for the loss. Organized labor
worked against her. D'Amico was helped by his former Senate
colleagues. Murphy's initial campaign tactic emphasizing history _
that she was bidding to become the first woman to hold statewide
office in Massachusetts _ over her personal qualifications was
ill-conceived.
   But the final straw for many Dukakis supporters may have been a
Boston Herald column the day before the convention. Under a
headline of ``Question of Loyalty,'' the column quoted unnamed
members of former Gov. King's transition team as saying she asked
King if she could participate in his administration after King
defeated Dukakis in 1978.
   Murphy said the allegation, which continues to haunt her, ``is
one that's always made me furious because it's basically wrong.''
   Murphy is unmarried, lives in Brookline _ like Dukakis _ and is
known for the long hours she gives to her work.
   ``As a kid I was very shy growing up,'' said Murphy. ``I got
through that by achieving.''

<HEAD>Conservative Buckley Family Raises Money To Help Democrat Defeat
Weicker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Buckley family, a leading voice of
conservatives nationwide, has moved beyond rhetoric in its
longstanding feud with fellow Connecticut Republican Lowell P.
Weicker Jr.
   The Buckleys, who drew a few laughs at the Republican National
Convention this summer in New Orleans when they announced their
endorsement of Democrat Joseph Lieberman in the race for Weicker's
Senate seat, have launched a political action committee and raised
nearly $4,000 to help Lieberman, federal records show.
   A report filed last week with the Federal Election Commission by
BuckPac, the newly created fund-raising arm of ``Buckleys for
Lieberman,'' reported $3,737.50 in campaign contributions.
   Priscilla L. Buckley of Sharon, Conn., the committee treasurer
and sister of National Review editor William F. Buckley Jr. and
former Sen. James Buckley, said $1,000 has gone to Lieberman and
another $200 was split up among four Republican congressional
candidates in Connecticut.
   The family plans on spending the remaining $2,500 on local
newspaper ads attacking Weicker, she said.
   Buckley said the family did not solicit contributions, but said
small donations were received from ``people around the country who
have been offended by Lowell Weicker.''
   She said contributions have slowed to a trickle, adding that the
family expected to receive about $1,000 and ``were rather
astonished to get three times that amount.''
   The feud between Weicker, a leader of the liberal wing of the
party, and the Buckleys, who represent the conservative branch of
the GOP, began long before the 1988 Senate race.
   The Buckleys accuse Weicker of being a far-out liberal who
should not be a Republican.
   Weicker counters that the Buckleys represent an
ultra-conservative extremism that is dangerous to the GOP.
   ``The conservatives of that ilk don't want a Republican Party
with a broad base,'' Weicker said in an interview earlier this
month. ``They want a narrow party such as their Conservative Party.
   ``They obviously look at Lowell Weicker as frustrating that end,
and believe me, they get out there and do their hatchet job as best
they can because they don't care about the Republican Party,''
Weicker said. ``They care about their ultra-conservative
principles, be damned with the party.''
   Weicker points to the 1970 Senate race in New York in which
James Buckley defeated the Republican nominee in a three-way race
with 39 percent. Buckley lost a re-election bid in 1976 to Democrat
Daniel Patrick Moynihan and four years later lost a Senate bid in
Connecticut against Democrat Christopher J. Dodd.
   In 1985, Weicker and Dodd opposed his nomination as a federal
appeals court judge, but Buckley won Senate confirmation.
   Weicker has often been the subject of criticism in William
Buckley's National Review.
   Lieberman spokesman Marla Romash said ``anybody who knows Joe
Lieberman'' realizes that the Buckleys, specifically William
Buckley, raised money for the Democrat ``not because he likes Joe
Lieberman but because he hates Lowell Weicker.''
   Priscilla Buckley, in a telephone interview Friday, said Rep.
John G. Rowland, R-Conn., one of the four GOP congressional
candidates to receive $50 each from BuckPac, returned his
contribution.
   Rowland, whom many expected to challenge Weicker in a primary
but decided against it, returned the money ``because he didn't feel
he should take it from a fund that was against a Republican,'' she
acknowledged.

   Former world heavyweight boxing champion Leon
Spinks no longer is climbing inside the ring, but he does intend to
work behind the bar.
   He is attending bartending school and explains:
   ``Serving drinks can be the hardest thing; they've got a lot of
drinks out there. Weird drinks. Different colors and what not. Some
things you would never drink.''
   Spinks, who upset Muhammad Ali in 1978 and held the title until
Ali won it back seven months later, has been impressive during his
four-week internship at Arietha's Lounge, said owner Arietha
DeLoach.
   ``He's not too proud to work after the fact that he had been a
millionaire,'' she said. ``He's back to square one now. He is very
dependable. He's a people's person. Everyone likes him.''
   DeLoach and Spinks both declined to elaborate on the
circumstances that led the former champ to tend bar in Detroit.
   But Spinks offered that he wants to do well.
   ``Maybe, someday, down the road, I may open my own place,''
Spinks said. ``Maybe someday you'll see the name Spinks in lights.''

   Pop star Michael Jackson says his $125,000
donation to the Motown Museum is a token of thanks to the man who
gave him his start _ Berry Gordy Jr.
   Jackson also donated three items from his personal collection to
the museum _ a trademark glove, a hat and a uniform he wore when he
was 13 and performing with the Jackson Five, said museum spokesman
Lee Solters.
   ``I'm very happy and proud to be back to the soil from which I
came,'' Jackson said Sunday. ``Berry Gordy is the man that made it
all possible for me. I want to say thank you, Berry, and I love
you.''
   Gordy, who founded Motown Records in 1959, called Jackson one of
the museum's greatest supporters.
   ``Michael Jackson knows success in life is not merely confined
to fame and fortune and material gains, but it's also found in a
continual awareness of our roots, his roots,'' said Gordy.

   ``Ghostbusters'' producer Bernie Brillstein
will bring the world of ``junk bond'' king Michael Milken to the
screen.
   The Brillstein Co. has acquired the film rights to ``The
Predator's Ball'' by Connie Bruck, a senior reporter for American
Lawyer who wrote about Milken's exploits in the Beverly Hills
office of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   ``This will not be a movie about Michael Milken, but about the
financial-business world he inhabits,'' said Brillstein.
   The company was notified Wednesday it was the target of a
criminal federal grand jury probe.
   In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
civil complaint against Drexel, Milken and others alleging they
schemed with imprisoned insider-trader Ivan F. Boesky to profit on
inside information, cheat Drexel clients and commit other frauds.

   Novelist Harold Robbins, whose pulp potboilers
have sold more than 500 million copies, was living like one of his
own high-rolling protagonists when a bathroom accident left him
unable to walk.
   Now, 3{ years and more than $1 million in medical bills later,
Robbins is doing daily battle with his disability. He also has
finished his 19th novel, a loosely autobiographical work called,
``The Storyteller,'' according to this week's People magazine.
   Stepping out of the shower, he tripped on a 4-inch-high splash
panel and struck his head on a marble counter, sliding across the
floor and striking the toilet bowl with such force that he knocked
it off its pipes. Doctors told him that his left hip had been
shattered and his right fractured.
   Robbins is undergoing therapy and has had an electrical device
implanted in his spine that helps him fight off the worst of the
pain, the magazine says. He has graduated from a wheelchair to a
walker to lightweight crutches.
   Doctors promise that he will eventually be able to trade his
crutches for cane.
   ``The main thing is I believe I'm going to walk,'' Robbins said.
``I believe I'm going to move. I believe I'm going to get around.''

   George Burns, who for years urged his wife and
partner in comedy Gracie Allen to ``Say goodnight, Gracie,'' still
has something to say to her 24 years after her death.
   At 92, he has collaborated with ghostwriter David Fisher on the
book, ``Gracie: A Love Story,'' due out next week.
   ``I have to be honest. I was a lousy lover,'' Burns writes.
``But Gracie married me for laughs, not for sex. Of course, she got
both of them _ when we had sex, she laughed.''
   In 1964, when the heart disease that had plagued her for years
finally took Gracie's life, Burns was inconsolable. For a time,
Burns says, ``things were very, very bad for me. My life was
Gracie.''
   Things eventually turned around, but he still visits her grave
monthly in Glendale, Calif., bringing flowers and conversation.
   ``I talk to her,'' Burns says in this week's issue of People
magazine. ``I tell her what I'm doing.''
   Burns says death holds no terror, because ``I know Gracie's up
there. And if they've got vaudeville, we can be headliners.''

   The death of a black teen-ager on a Staten
Island street has forced residents of a working-class neighborhood
in New York's whitest borough to proclaim they are not racists.
   When Derrick Antonio Tyus, 17, was killed by a car shortly after
a racial encounter with whites, New Yorkers recalled their most
infamous racial incident of recent years, the death of a black man
who was run over as he fled a gang of whites in Howard Beach, a
neighborhood in the borough of Queens.
   Police indicated Tyus' death Oct. 7 was not directly caused by a
racist incident, according to Staten Island's borough president,
who said the investigation found that Tyus was hit by a car 20
minutes after the exchange of racial slurs when he accidentally
jumped in the street while horsing around with friends
   That explanation has not satisfied everyone. State Sen. David A.
Paterson has called for a special prosecutor to investigate.
   At the urging of Paterson and other civil rights leaders, U.S.
Attorney Andrew Maloney agreed last week to conduct a preliminary
investigation into the death. The FBI will gather information to
determine whether a grand jury investigation into possible civil
rights violations is warranted.
   Meanwhile, residents and political leaders rushed to defend
Staten Island and the neighborhood of Rosebank from comparisons to
Howard Beach.
   ``We are not unique from any other community throughout this
country,'' said Staten Island Borough President Ralph Lamberti.
``Do we have racial problems? The answer is yes.''
   ``But that should not characterize our borough as a racist
borough,'' he said.
   The blacks involved in the incident come from the Park Hill
Housing Projects, a nondescript row of brick buildings about a mile
from Rosebank and its narrow streets of neat houses.
   Tyus and nine other youths were walking past JJ's Bar and Grill
when a smaller group of young whites came outside and the two
groups exchanged racial slurs, police said.
   The blacks told police that several white men got into two cars
and followed them for several blocks. At one point, a white man
allegedly jumped out of a car and pushed an 11-year-old black to
the ground. They then fled in their cars.
   Police reportedly said some of those who were with Tyus have
changed their accounts several times.
   ``There were some verbal slurs that were made,'' Lamberti said
after a closed-door briefing from police. ``But there was no
incident, at least supported by the Police Department
investigation, where youngsters were chased through the streets
because of fear of physical harm and ran into an oncoming car. That
is not the case here.''
   ``To make the parallel to the Howard Beach case is totally
unfair to this community,'' he said.
   Even so, racial incidents are not new to Staten Island, which
has the smallest minority population among the city's five
boroughs. Of an estimated 420,000 residents, about 52,000 are
members of minority groups, most of them living on the island's
North Shore near the terminal for the Staten Island Ferry.
   Last summer a black man on his way home from work was chased by
a group of bat-wielding whites but escaped serious injury when
several whites from a pizzeria came to his aid.
   Several years ago, a black youth was beaten to death with a bat
at a playground by a group of white youths because he was dating a
white girl. And a white was fatally stabbed for no apparent reason
by blacks at a playground behind a black church.
   But some leaders said Rosebank is less racially polarized than
many Staten Island neighborhoods.
   ``I keep hearing that Rosebank is a racist community. To that, I
say nonsense,'' said the Rev. John Servodidio of St. Joseph's
Church, whose parish is a block from where Tyus was killed.
   ``After the accident, people from the community rushed outside
and placed a coat beneath the dying boy's head and covered him
until the ambulance came,'' he said. People in the crowd also
suggested the quickest way to get to a hospital, he said.
   ``Does that sound like a racist community?''
   Servodidio believes something positive can come out of the
incident.
   ``It's an opportunity for us to teach,'' he said, which he
boldly did from the pulpit last week when he told his congregation
he knew who the ``hypocrites and racists'' were among them and he
would ``pray for their conversion.''
   ``The people I was referring to, their heads went down,'' the
priest said.

   You closed your eyes and then you
opened them again, and the city was gone.
   Bluefields had been observing its 85th birthday, and despite the
hurricane warnings the bars in this Caribbean coastal city were
still full Friday afternoon.
   Few believed how bad it would be even after President Daniel
Ortega flew in and toured all the neighborhoods, telling people to
leave.
   In the evening the clouds got very thick, but the air was still
and the bay was calm.
   The wind came up around 9 p.m. Then came the rain. People began
to leave the low ground near the bay and take refuge in the Hotel
Caribe, a solid concrete building where I was staying with several
other journalists and a very good cook.
   We had him make us a big meal of lobster and shrimp because we
thought we might not get much to eat for awhile. Someone asked for
wine, but there wasn't any.
   As the wind rose, we didn't want to open the doors of the hotel
because the wind was so strong we had trouble closing them again.
We took paintings off the walls, tore them apart and nailed the
wood from the frames over the windows.
   The refugees stayed calm, except for a few children who were
frightened by the sound of debris hitting the walls and the
deafening whistle of the wind.
   We peered out small windows and keyholes. We saw whole zinc
roofs being tossed off houses and sent clattering down the street.
Trees were being ripped apart. Electric wires were falling.
   A Cuban weather technician told me that at 3 a.m. Saturday, at
the height of the storm, the wind gusts hit 145 mph.
   After dawn the storm began to ease. People began to emerge and
look around. Every street was filled with debris. Every building
was damaged, only a few still had their roofs. There were all kinds
of small dead animals around _ parrots, bats, huge rats, dogs.
   People were just dazed, running around, going nowhere.
Authorities told us there were just 21 dead in the area. I couldn't
believe anybody had survived. It's a city of 38,000, I don't know
where everybody was hiding.
   There were people who had been cut, had taken blows. One
17-year-old boy had a deep head wound. At an open-air hospital,
Cuban doctors were stitching people up without anesthetic.
   The Moravian church was crushed. It looked like a giant had put
his foot on it. At the market near the docks, there were boats
inside the houses. A statue in the city park was decapitated.
   The city may have been saved from Hurricane Joan by its bay,
which protected it from the huge waves and tremendous storm surge
that is usually the most serious killer in hurricanes.
   People shared their food, they were very generous. There was a
short period of plenty because all the refrigerators had lost
power, so they wanted to eat right away.
   I saw some men carrying a cow's hindquarters through the
streets. Other people ate downed coconuts. In a wrecked seminary, a
man guarded his flock of wet chickens.
   People began to make jury-rigged roofs out of pieces of zinc. In
the center of town, where most stores are owned by Chinese
immigrants, the merchants were trying to shelter their remaining
goods.
   Prison inmates may have suffered least, because the jail was
solid. But then they were taken out, with soldiers guarding them,
to work on clearing the road to the airport.
   There was no way to get out of town. There's no road west
through the jungle, and the airport was closed. The only
communication was by government radio.
   The airport finally opened after noon Sunday. After we took off
to fly to Managua, the pilot gave us an aerial tour. Not one tree
in Bluefields had any leaves. The palm trees looked like spikes.
   In the park that had been so gay during the anniversary
celebration, the trees looked like skeletons. The city practically
died on its 85th birthday.
   Then we flew over the port of El Bluff, on the other side of the
bay. It had been flattened. It looked like a bulldozer had scraped
the earth.
   I lived through the earthquake that killed 10,000 people in
Managua in 1972. It was deadly, but it left houses still standing
and the leaves on the trees. But in Bluefields nothing was left,
neither the leaves nor the houses.
   How do I feel? Good, because I'm alive.

<TEXT>
   An insider trading scandal is revealing plenty of
intrigue: top politicians' aides buy stock, a hidden camera
captures an apparent attempt to bribe a lawmaker, and a key man
says he would rather die than talk.
   The politically sensitive Recruit Scandal is named after the
Recruit Co., a high-flying conglomerate whose offices in Tokyo's
glittering Ginza district were raided Wednesday.
   The raid, filmed for television as prosecutors carted away about
1,500 boxes of confiscated documents, was followed by the first
arrest since the scandal went national in July.
   Hiroshi Matsubara, 47, a former top aide to the head of
Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real-estate subsidiary, was charged Thursday
with offering a bribe to Yonosuke Narazaki, member of Parliament
for the opposition United Socialist Democratic Party. Narazaki is a
persistent driver of Parliament's probe of the scandal.
   With that arrest the probe is moving on two fronts, with
investigations by prosecutors and the Diet, Japan's parliament,
backed by aggressive reporting from some news media.
   ``At long last, the scandal has come under criminal
investigation, at least in part,'' the Asahi Shimbun, which made
the first revelations of the scandal's political bearing in June,
said in an editorial.
   But the liberal-leaning newspaper, while praising the display of
independence by the Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office, expressed
worry that the criminal investigation could ``give some Diet
members a perfect excuse for calling for a slowdown in the Diet
probe.''
   The alleged bribe was a flagrant example of the so-called
``money politics'' that underlie the Recruit scandal, with
reverberations to the top of Japanese politics and in the stock
market as well.
   A camera, hidden by Nippon Television Network with Narazaki's
permission, showed Matsubara asking the opposition parliamentarian
to help save the Recruit company and offering an envelope full of
cash, saying ``We intend to support you for the rest of your
political career.''
   Narazaki said Matsubara, who resigned his Recruit position as
soon as the video was shown on national television Sept. 6, visited
him three times offering $38,000.
   Matsubara's former boss, Hiromasa Ezoe, has been hospitalized
reportedly suffering from depression. But on Oct. 12 several
members of the Diet questioned him about Recruit's having sold
shares in Recruit-Cosmos at bargain prices to top political aides
before the company went public in 1986.
   The shares leaped in value when open trading began, yielding fat
profits, and it is widely assumed the money went to finance
political activities of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   The lawmakers quoted Ezoe, who founded the parent company
Recruit, as having told them he was sorry for having caused trouble
to people whose names had been revealed as having benefited.
   ``I cannot bear to see any more people resign or be
inconvenienced. I would rather kill myself than disclose their
names,'' Ezoe was quoted as saying from his hospital bed.
   Nonetheless, the plot's next unfolding revealed the biggest name
so far on the list of Recruit-Cosmos beneficiaries _ that of
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Previously it was said an aide to
Miyazawa bought Recruit-Cosmos shares.
   The finance minister, also deputy premier, denied purchasing the
shares himself and apologized for being lax in supervising an aide
who he said let a third party use Miyazawa's name to buy the shares.
   Still to be heard from are all the political aides who are said
to have actually held and sold the Recruit-Cosmos shares.
   Until Friday, news reports said 76 people received shares, but
the Asahi Shimbun quoted ``informed sources'' as saying Ezoe sold
shares to 140 people.
   No authoritative complete list has been made public yet, but the
politicians who have confirmed their aides held shares include
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, now secretary
general of the ruling Liberal Democrats.
   All have denied personal wrongdoing. The transactions were not
illegal but the scandal called sharp attention to political ethics
and intimate links between business and politics.
   The opposition and ruling parties all need money to run election
campaigns, constituency affairs and parliamentary activities, and
big business has always been a major source of cash. In Japan's
rapidly expanding economy, new companies like Recruit-Cosmos have
become a source of political money through the device of selling
shares at bargain prices before they go public.
   But never before has the practice made so many headlines or
administered such a jolt.
   The opposition Japan Socialist Party demanded Miyazawa's
resignation, but the finance minister has refused. Takeshita, who
needs Miyazawa to quarterback a tax-reform package through the
Diet, has said Miyazawa bears an ``ethical responsibility'' but
resignation was not called for.

<HEAD>Nationwide Survey Finds Americans Are ``Scientific Illiterates''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 500 years after Copernicus postulated that
Earth revolves around the sun, millions of Americans think
otherwise, suggests a poll that found vast numbers of the nation's
adults ``scientifically illiterate.''
   Many Americans also mistakenly believe that laser beams are
focused sound waves and that atoms are smaller than electrons, said
Jon Miller, director of the Public Opinion Laboratory at Northern
Illinois University, who conducted a nationwide survey for the
National Science Foundation.
   In a July telephone survey, 2,041 adults 18 or older were asked
about 75 questions on basic science, Miller said. The survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Asked whether the Earth goes around the sun or the sun around
the Earth, 21 percent replied incorrectly. Seven percent said they
didn't know.
   In the early 16th century, the Polish astronomer Nicholas
Copernicus laid the foundation for modern astronomy with his
heliocentric theory of planetary motion in which the planets
revolved around a motionless sun.
   Forty-five percent correctly said it takes a year for the Earth
to orbit the sun, but 17 percent said one day, 2 percent said one
month and 9 percent didn't know.
   ``The results show that on very basic ideas, vast numbers of
Americans are scientifically illiterate,'' Miller said Sunday.
``It's a fairly dire situation.''
   The results of the survey haven't been fully tabulated yet, but
it appears that 93 percent to 95 percent would have to be
considered scientifically illiterate, lacking fundamental knowledge
of scientific vocabulary, methodology and an understanding of
science's impact on the world, said Miller. The group's 1985 survey
found a 95 percent illiteracy rate.
   The results indicate many Americans have little idea of what
presidential candidates are talking about when they list key issues
such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, acid rain, the greenhouse
effect and the space race, he said.
   Leon Lederman, who last week was named co-winner of the 1988
Nobel Prize for physics and is director of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, called the latest findings
``pretty devastating.''
   ``How you can preserve democracy when the world is increasingly
more complex scientifically and technologically, and people are
increasingly more ignorant of the issues?'' he asked.
   On other questions, the survey found that 43 percent said
correctly that electrons, which are components of atoms, are
smaller than atoms; 20 percent thought they were larger and 37
percent had no idea.
   Asked if lasers _ an essential component of the proposed Star
Wars defense system _ work by focusing sound waves, 36 percent
correctly answered the statement was false. Twenty-nine percent
thought it was true and 35 percent didn't know. Lasers work by
focusing light waves. In fact, the name stands for Light
Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
   Most of those surveyed _ 76 percent _ answered correctly that
light travels faster than sound. Nineteen percent mistakenly
thought sound moves faster.
   Miller said some of the responses indicate the lack of
scientific knowledge could present some practical problems.
   For example, 63 percent said incorrectly that antibiotics kill
viruses as well as bacteria.
   So if a doctor tells a patient he has a virus and the patient
has an antibiotic around the house, he's liable to take it, said
Miller. Antibiotics don't kill viruses.
   Miller said the great majority of high school graduates have not
had a day's instruction in algebra, physics or chemistry.
   ``It's important to turn that around,'' he said.

   Three jailers face felony charges in a fire that
was set outside an inmate's locked cell and burned the prisoner,
officials say.
   Warrants charging the guards with burning a building and burning
personal property were issued Friday in the Oct. 15 fire at the
jail on Deer Island, city Penal Commissioner Robert Walsh said. The
unidentified inmate suffered facial burns.
   One of the guards, Calvin Davis, was fired, officials said.
   The two others, Michael Patterson and Antonio Whitfield, were
suspended without pay for five days pending a departmental
disciplinary hearing, Walsh said. The hearing could result in
further action, including dismissal.
   The prisoner was transferred to another institution.

<HEAD>Mexican Police Officials Charged In Planning Heroin Shipments To
U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Plans for a $50 million-a-month heroin pipeline
from Mexico were foiled with the arrest of two Mexican police
commanders who officials say boasted they could close airports in
their home state to help the smuggling.
   Pedro Guillen, 39, and Margaritan Villagrana, 42, commanders
from the state of Guerrero, which includes Acapulco, were to be
arraigned today, authorities said. They were arrested late Saturday
in a hotel following a four-month investigation, said Robert
Strang, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Adminstration.
   ``They had the arrogance to travel to the United States to
peddle their goods,'' said Robert M. Stutman, special agent in
charge of the DEA in New York.
   ``Whenever you have police officials involved in the trafficking
of major amounts of drugs it is truly the worst betrayal of the
public trust. To have foreign police officers come to the United
States to traffic in drugs is even worse.''
   The suspects agreed to supply 50 kilograms, or 110 pounds, of
heroin manufactured in Mexico each month, Strang said Sunday. A
kilogram of heroin has a street value of up to $1 million.
   Mexican heroin ``is not something we normally have available to
us here in New York'' because virtually all the heroin smuggled
into the city comes from Asia, said Strang.
   ``These two defendants were using their positions in the
Acapulco region (of Mexico) to safely transport the heroin to the
United States,'' Strang said.
   U.S. agents posing as drug traffickers spoke with the men in
Mexico by telephone, and the pair flew here Friday to complete the
deal, Strang said.
   After dining with the Mexicans on Saturday night, two undercover
agents went to the mens' hotel and gave them $15,000 as partial
payment, he said.
   A surveillance team then moved in and made the arrests, Strang
said.
   The two were charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin, a
felony that carries a penalty of 25 years to life in prison, he
said.
   The Mexican officers bragged to the undercover agents in
tape-recorded conversations that they could close down airports in
their home region if a plane from New York flew in to pick up the
heroin, Strang said.
   The Reagan administration has charged that drug enforcement
agencies in Mexico are filled with corruption. Earlier this year,
nine people, including three Mexican police officials, were
indicted in Los Angeles in connection with the torture and murder
of U.S. DEA agent Enrique Camarena in Mexico. Three, including a
former homicide investigator in Guadalajara, Mexico, have been
convicted.

<TEXT>
   In a pre-election face-off, Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres claimed progress in his peace efforts but Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir accused his rival of seeking Arab support.
   Sunday's 30-minute, pre-recorded debate on national television
gave the public its only chance to see the two party leaders go at
each other face-to-face before the Nov. 1 Parliamentary elections.
   Peres, head of the leftist Labor Party, seemed to benefit from
the endorsement of his approach to peace talks by Jordan's King
Hussein.
   It put Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud Bloc, on the
defensive and provided the missing ingredient to Peres' peace
proposals: a possible partner.
   Shamir, dressed in a black suit and black-dotted lavender tie,
claimed Peres was out of bounds in arranging for Hussein to endorse
Labor's peace strategy in a U.S. television interview last week.
   ``I must say that to involve an Arab ruler in Israel's election
campaign is crass interference. It is unprecedented,'' said Shamir.
``The people have to reject this unequivocally.''
   Peres, also dressed in a dark suit and speaking directly to the
camera, responded: ``Is it a sin or an accomplishment to enlist an
Arab country in the cause of peace? I wish we could enlist all
countries in the cause of peace,'' said Peres.
   Peres, his voice often turning angry, vowed ``to get out of this
terrible circle of war and to enter into negotiations, to begin
negotiations immediately after elections.''
   Shamir, also pledged to seek talks with the Arabs but was
critical of King Hussein, alluding to the Jordanian leader's
meeting over the weekend with Palestine Liberation Organization
Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   ``Hussein supports Arafat and the PLO today,'' he said. ``Is
this an opportunity? Is this the way to peace? Just the oppposite.''
   Hussein, Arafat, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt met in the
Jordanian port of Aqaba on Saturday and reportedly tried to work
out common ground for an international peace conference.
   Shamir, speaking confidently with thrusting gestures, suggested
he would take a realistic, if more difficult, road to negotiations
with the Arabs.
   He pledged not to ``surrender to the Arabs'' but seek peace
based on autonomy for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip even though this has been
rejected by the Arabs. He called for the resumption of autonomy
talks with Egypt, which Cairo broke off in 1981 after failing to
win Palestinian support.
   Peres called for an international conference to talk peace, but
Shamir said the Arabs would talk directly to Israel without foreign
interference if there was no other option.
   ``There will be no international conference, and they (the
Arabs) will therefore have no alternative but to enter direct
negotiations,'' Shamir said.
   Peres sought to portray Shamir as unbending and intransigent,
blocking all moves towards peace during the four years of the
national unity government which united the two major political
blocs after the stalemated 1984 elections.
   ``Mr. Shamir is a consistent individual, in my opinion
occasionally stubborn,'' said Peres, who then seemed to suggest
that Shamir's inflexibility stemmed from his advanced age, 73.
   Peres noted that he was 65.
   Peace talks dominated the opening half of the debate, but
economic and social issues also played a major role. On these,
Peres appeared more evasive, and Shamir promised to lower taxes, a
move opposed by Labor.
   Aides for both sides claimed victory, but neither expected it to
have a dramatic impact on the undecided voters, whom analysts say
account for about 8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters.
   One reason is that after four years of public bickering over the
peace issue, Israeli voters are well-versed in the approaches of
the two leaders.

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen today
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dipped slightly.
   After opening at 126.17 yen, its lowest level since June 21, the
dollar rose, apparently because dealers were concerned the Bank of
Japan might intervene to prop up the dollar.
   The currency peaked 126.75 yen shortly before closing at 126.60
yen, up 0.20 yen from Friday's close of 126.40 yen.
   Exchange dealers attributed the low opening rate to the market's
skepticism over the ability of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to reach agreement on production quotas among
members of the oil cartel.
   ``But the general perception of the market was the Bank of Japan
will likely intervene if the dollar declined to the 125-yen
level,'' said a currency dealer in Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 32 points last week, lost 57.03
points, or 0.21 percent, from Saturday's close. It ended the day at
27,281.54.
   Stock dealers said the initial fall in the dollar today hurt
share prices.
   ``When there is a wild fluctuation in the foreign exchange
rates, investors are not enthused about participating in the stock
market,'' said a dealer at a major securities firm in Tokyo, also
speaking anonymously.
   Export-oriented shares, including electronic and automobile
issues, lost ground.
   Dealers added that Emperor Hirohito's continuing illness was
also having a negative impact on the stock market.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most
major stocks are listed, was a thin 600 million shares.

   Gas leaking from an oil refinery touched off
explosions and a raging blaze that killed 25 people and injured 17
in Shanghai's worst fire since the Communists came to power,
official media reported.
   Saturday's blaze at the Shanghai Gaoqiao Oil Chemistry Corp.'s
refinery occurred when ``liquefied gas'' leaked after a worker
opened a water drain valve, the city's Liberation Daily newspaper
said in its Sunday editions.
   The English-language China Daily said the fire was the worst in
China's largest city since the Communists came to power in 1949.
   Shanghai police say they did not know kind of gas caught fire
and called it only ``liquified gas.'' But editors at the China
Daily said when queried that they believed it to be liquified
natural gas.
   A guard reported the leak about midnight Friday but nobody paid
attention, the reports said. An hour later, the gas was ignited by
sparks from a nearby construction workers' shed, touching off a
fire that quickly spread back to the refinery, they said.
   More than 400 firemen rushed to the refinery area in the city
680 miles southwest of the capital to fight the blaze, which was
extinguished in an hour, China Daily said.
   Twenty-three bodies were found in a dozen construction workers'
sheds destroyed by the fire, the report said.
   Nineteen other people were injured, but two died on the way to
hospitals. Three of the remaining survivors were in critical
condition and doctors expected the death toll to rise, China Daily
said.
   The newspaper identified one of the injured as the refinery
janitor, whose attempt to report the fire failed because the
telephone was not working.
   An official in Shanghai, reached by telephone today, said there
was no change in the number of casualties.
   The reports gave no estimates on the damage.

<TEXT>
   A social worker who is a Choctaw
Indian has fought for four years to protect eight weedy acres he
believes are a desecrated Indian burial ground.
   ``You want to cry. You just want to cry,'' Mel Fletcher said
recently. ``You can feel the spirit when you go there.
   ``I'll tell you exactly what one of our medicine men felt,''
said Fletcher. ``Mad Bear dropped to the ground with his hands to
the sky.''
   Since 1984, the social worker at Akron's North American Indian
Center has fought to protect the plot known as South Park, which
has been threatened as a potential source of cover soil for an
adjacent landfill pit.
   The site has been ravaged over the years, mostly by amateur
archaeologists hunting artifacts from centuries ago, when Indian
tribes lived on the bluff above the Cuyahoga River.
   David S. Brose, curator of archaeology at the Cleveland Museum
of Natural History, said he was unsure whether the site was a
burial ground or an Indian village.
   The last museum research in the area was halted in 1981, partly
due to ``careless looting of what partially disturbed deposits
still existed,'' said a report by Brose.
   The area ``has been dug up in places by amateurs and
professionals,'' said North American Indian Center Director Clark
Hosick. ``There are still a number of remains there. It's kind of
overgrown now, or you would be able to see remains strewn about on
the ground.''
   Only about 25 percent of the original site remains, Hosick said.
The rest was destroyed when the 19-acre, 300-foot-deep landfill pit
was excavated.
   ``It's a site we want to see protected. It's gone far enough,
and it doesn't need to be disturbed anymore,'' said Hosick.
   Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director Richard L. Shank
is expected to decide the merits of an application for a landfill
permit by landfill owner Boyas Excavation Co.
   Fletcher, a 60-year-old member of the Choctaw tribe native to
Oklahoma and Mississippi, has lived in northeast Ohio since 1949.
He didn't find out about the site until 1984, when he read a
newspaper column describing how it had been torn up by amateurs
seeking Indian mementos.
   With no public announcement, Fletcher and about a dozen other
Indians broke through a gate at the site and set up a traditional
Indian camp for a weekend.
   ``When you get a bunch of young folks involved, it's pretty hard
to control them,'' Fletcher recalled. ``Especially natives, because
they're so moved by this, it makes them angry inside. We wanted to
keep the public sentiment with us. We were told we would be
arrested, but that really didn't materialize.''
   Fletcher returns to the site once or twice a week. On one recent
visit, he pointed to new shallow pits left by what he called
``grave robbers.''
   But recent events have encouraged him to believe the site will
soon belong to Indians again.
   State Sen. Grace Drake has introduced legislation that would
forbid creation of a landfill in any public park. South Park is
adjacent to the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.
   At his home, Fletcher keeps bones he found at the site in 1984
which he believes are those of a young Indian woman. He said he
will return the bones to the ground only when Indians again control
it.
   ``You can't separate the bones from the spirit,'' Fletcher said.

   A U.S. commission looking to close
obsolete military bases may be about to play taps for Fort Douglas,
and politicians say they may be ready to surrender the post built
in 1862 to protect stagecoach routes.
   Members of Utah's congressional delegation consider the
picturesque fort and its Civil War-era buildings a likely target in
the Pentagon's quest to shut about two dozen bases.
   They say they'll have to acquiesce if it can be shown that the
move would save money, but some are skeptical that any real savings
can be had.
   ``Our main concern is that they operate from up-to-date,
accurate data,'' said Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens, whose district
includes the fort.
   ``If the data is accurate and there's no indication of
unfairness, then I don't know what I can do. You can't be for
closing down everybody else's things, and not be willing to look at
your own.''
   Congress this month approved legislation that calls for a
Pentagon-appointed panel to recommend by Dec. 31 a list of bases to
be closed. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci would have until
Jan. 15, five days before leaving office, to accept or reject the
entire list. The law aims to save up to $5 billion a year.
   Fort Douglas is among a small group of bases that critics have
long contended contributes little to the nation's defense.
   Built in 1862 in foothills between Salt Lake City and the
Wasatch Mountains, the fort was named at President Lincoln's
suggestion after his Illinois rival, Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, who
died the year before.
   Ostensibly built to protect stagecoach routes from Indian
attacks, the fort's first commander, Col. Patrick Conner,
acknowledged that he chose the foothills overlooking the city so he
could keep an eye on Brigham Young's Mormon pioneers. He said they
were too friendly with the Indians.
   At one point, Conner sought to have Mormon merchants sign a
loyalty oath to the United States before allowing them to sell
goods to the fort.
   In this century, the post housed prisoner-of-war camps in both
world wars.
   Politicians may be more willing to accept the closure now
because the move probably would cost only a fraction of the 414
civilian jobs at the post. And the University of Utah is eager to
absorb 112 buildings should the Army declare them surplus,
officials say.
   Nevertheless, Owens, who suggested the fort be closed two years
ago, later decided after a visit it would be cheaper to maintain.
   A 1981 congressional study requested by Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah,
after the Army announced plans to close the fort reached the same
conclusion. It said that although the Army would save money by
closing the post, heavy use by military reserve groups made Fort
Douglas cost effective overall.
   Garn said that conclusion still may be valid, and he said he
would seek another independent study if the commission recommends
closure.
   Fort Douglas is home to 3,300 Utah reservists from the Army,
Navy and Marine Corps, as well as headquarters for the 96th Army
Reserve Command that oversees about 24,000 reservists in seven
western states.
   The fort also houses the office that disburse paychecks to
reservists in 14 states, recruiting commands for the four services
and a military examination center.
   In contrast, the fort's headquarters command consists of only
five active duty military and 62 civilian personnel.
   If the fort were closed, the reserve units would remain and
continue to require active-duty support, said post commander Col.
Fred Hillyard.
   ``Fort Douglas accomplishes that in a very cost-effective manner
and to do it another way might prove more costly,'' he said.
   The fort's tenants pay only $2 a square foot for space, and they
would almost certainly pay more anywhere else in the Salt Lake City
area, said Maj. Bill Auer, an Army Reserves public relations
officer.
   Jim Abbee, spokesman for the Commission on Base Realignment and
Closure that is studying military bases, said the panel will look
at reserve activities when it reviews Fort Douglas. But he said
there is no list of closure targets yet and one of the 12
commission members still must be appointed.
   ``It's a blank piece of paper at the moment,'' Abbee said.

   The Reagan administration, smarting from its
long and tragic involvement in Lebanon, is treading softly through
the maze of Lebanese politics with a nervous eye on the country's
creeping partition.
   U.S. diplomacy is essentially in a holding pattern designed to
prevent Lebanon's disintegration, at least until the next U.S.
administration takes over and decides whether to continue American
involvement or to pull out.
   ``We want to do nothing that will nudge that country into
partition,'' said Richard Murphy, the assistant secretary of state
who has dealt with Lebanon in recent years.
   Murphy's latest gambit was a shuttle to Lebanon in September to
try to work out a list of presidential candidates acceptable to the
Christians who have traditionally run the country, the Moslems who
constitute its majority and to Syria, which controls large parts of
Lebanon.
   ``Murphy couldn't get Syria to budge'' from its support of
Mikhail Daher, whom the main Christian group rejected, said an
official who accompanied Murphy to Damascus. He spoke on condition
he not be named.
   U.S. officials now concede their initial support of Daher was
wrong because it antagonized Lebanon's Christians and in effect
prevented elections from being held.
   Instead, tiny Lebanon has two governments, one led by Maronite
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun and the other by Moslem acting prime
minister Salim Hoss.
   Aoun's appointment on Sept. 22, in the last minutes of the
presidency of Amin Gemayel, deepened a political schism that
threatens to formalize the unofficial Christian-Moslem partition
created by Lebanon's 1975 civil war.
   Because of the fragmentation, U.S. officials are now dealing
with all sides. ``There isn't a leader in Lebanon we're not dealing
with,'' Murphy said in congressional testimony.
   But that course is also fraught with problems. Both Christians
and Moslems last week accused U.S. ambassador John McCarthy of
interfering in Lebanon's affairs, although both sides had earlier
urged U.S. involvement to help resolve the crisis.
   The Reagan administration first became enmeshed in Lebanon in
1982, when the United States sent in the Marines to oversee the
pullout of Palestinian guerrillas and invading Israeli troops from
Beirut. A suicide car bomber in 1983 killed 241 Marines, leading to
the end of the American military presence.
   But Secretary of State George Shultz was determined. He
orchestrated negotiations between Israel and Lebanon for a peace
agreement in 1983, only to have the rug pulled from under him by
Gemayel's abdication of the agreement soon after it was signed.
   ``Shultz was disgusted and for a long time he refused to touch
Lebanon,'' said Yahya Sadowski, an authority on Lebanon at the
Brookings Institution, an independent think tank.
   The hands-off policy remained in place until late last year,
when Murphy sought permission to try again. This time, the United
States wanted to serve as postman between Syrian President Hafez
Assad and Gemayel, who weren't talking to each other.
   The object of the exchange was to agree on constitutional
reforms in Lebanon that would grant the Moslem majority more power
and would facilitate the September elections. But that effort also
failed, with the sides failing to agree on a power-sharing formula.
   With the failure of efforts to find a consensus candidate in
September, ``they really lost what enthusiasm they had left,'' said
Sadowski.
   Why not give up?
   ``We're doing a lot less than we used to,'' concedes a State
Department official who makes daily policy on Lebanon. The United
States is no longer trying to build up the Lebanese army, its aid
programs are down to less than $1 million and it has washed its
hands of attempts to negotiate constitutional reform between the
parties, he said.
   ``But we're not pulling out. We'll remain engaged until the last
minute,'' the official added.
   The American ambassador and his staff in Beirut are still
meeting with the factions to try to fashion a short list of
candidates so that elections can be held, he said.
   ``Our involvement is one of the few things that helps maintain
the calm,'' the official said.
   U.S. officials contend that partition would be damaging to
American interests by further destabilizing the region and giving
free reign to drug traffickers and terrorists.
   In recent weeks, a new player has entered the Lebanon equation,
further complicating matters. Iraq, which until July was engaged in
a costly war with Iran, gave the Christian Lebanese forces $5
million and 68 tanks last month.
   The odd alliance between Moslem Iraq and the Christians is
directed at the Syria-Iran axis which dominates most of eastern
Lebanon and Beirut and its environs. Israel rules a portion of the
south.
   The next Washington administration inherits a sticky mess in
Lebanon. It may decide on another approach, but is quite likely to
withdraw and let the Lebanese sort things out themselves.

Lithuanian nationalist mass movement, delegates endorsed greater
autonomy after heated debate over whether their republic should
demand the right to secede from the Soviet Union.
   The conference in the republic's capital ended Sunday after
20,000 people sang nationalist songs and shed tears of joy at a
Mass to celebrate the government's return of a 14th-century
cathedral to the Roman Catholic church.
   The Lithuanian Movement for Restructuring, claiming 180,000
active supporters, softened a draft resolution that said the
republic ``reserves its right to withdraw from the Soviet Union ..
. by constitutionally acknowledged means.''
   The final version, approved Sunday by an overwhelming margin of
the more than 1,000 delegates, was nearly a carbon copy of the
Communist Party's position. It said Lithuania's ``relations with
other Soviet republics should be based on Leninist principles of
federalism, national equality and self-determination.''
   The conference also approved measures calling for control of the
republic's economy, establishment of diplomatic ties with foreign
countries and freedom for Lithianian political prisoners.
   The two-day conference of the movement known in Lithuanian as
Sajudis was the first since the group formed in June.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is pressing for
wide-ranging economic and political reforms, but has warned against
attempts by national groups to redraw the country's boundaries.
   Secession is one of the most sensitive issues for Lithuanians
and their Baltic neighbors, the Estonians and Latvians.
   The Soviet Union incorporated the three republics in 1940 under
a secret pact with Nazi Germany and some groups in the region say
the agreement should be renounced.
   Several speakers during the weekend conference received standing
ovations for suggesting the group label the Soviet takeover of
Lithuania an ``occupation.''
   Tempers in the Vilnius Sports Palace flared after one delegate,
Rolandas Paulauskas, said Lithuania should demand the right to
secede from the 15-republic Soviet Union. Some of the delegates
heckled Paulauskas.
   ``The speech we just heard should be considered a provocation.
We have to be realistic,'' said writer Vytautas Petkevisias, a
leader in the restructuring movement.
   Lithuania's reform-minded Communist Party chief, who sat through
much of the debate and was warmly received at the conference,
advised caution.
   ``Some of the speeches from this fine stage saddened me, or
rather have raised a lot of thought,'' said Algirdas Brazauskas. He
urged delegates to carefully consider the consequences of their
demands and act in a ``rational, business-like'' way.
   But Brazauskas, appointed the republic's party leader just four
days earlier to replace a conservative, said Lithuania's leaders
would ``systematically evaluate and solve as many problems as
possible.'' The audience cheered.
   The Lithuanian government has agreed to several nationalist
demands including declaring Lithuanian the official language and
lifting a ban on display of the flag that flew in Lithuania during
its independence between the two world wars.
   The first Mass in 30 years at the Vilnius Cathedral was
conducted outdoors Sunday to accommodate the worshipers, who gave
thanks both for the return of the cathedral and the rapid changes
sweeping this Baltic Republic of 3.6 million people.
   The Vilnius Cathedral was a center of Christianity in the Middle
Ages and its confiscation by the officially atheist Soviet
government had angered many Lithuanians, of whom nearly 2 million
are Catholics.
   The government converted the cathedral into an art gallery in
1950 and paintings line its walls instead of religious symbols.
   In an indication of recent changes in Lithuania, police who once
would have massed in threatening numbers around the crowd at
Sunday's Mass directed traffic instead. Lithuanian television
broadcast the service live.
   Men, women and children carried the once-banned yellow, green
and red Lithuanian flag and sang nationalist and religious hymns,
led by the first Lithuanian cardinal of modern times, Vincentas
Sladkevicius. The cardinal was appointed by the Vatican five months
ago.

<TEXT>
   As he nears his 40th birthday, the Prince of
Wales appears to be settling into a normal Royal Family family life
_ largely apart from his family, says People magazine.
   The warmth of the early married years of Prince Charles and his
wife, Diana, which surprised some after what many saw as a rather
businesslike match, has chilled and boredom has set in, the
magazine said in this week's edition.
   Moreover, the report said, Charles _ heir to the British throne
_ no longer shows the doting interest in his sons _ Prince William,
6, and Prince Harry, 4.
   Charles spends the days at his office-apartment at Buckingham
Palace, often sleeping there, and rushes off to the polo grounds
during country weekends, People said.
   Charles and Diana have become bored with each other's company,
the report said. Diana prefers her younger, livelier friends and
Charles has been seeking the company of more serious types,
including some older, married women like Bona Frescobaldi, 47, an
Italian marchesa and Dale Tryon, 40, who is married to one of the
prince's close friends, People said.
   But none of this should cause undue alarm about possible royal
rifts, People said. The couple are simply learning to do as most
royal pairs do _ coexist peacefully _ together, yet apart.
   Charles' birthday is Nov. 14.

   Leftist rebels freed 131 prison
inmates, including five held for political reasons, in an attack on
a town in northern El Salvador, military officials said.
   Members of the leftist guerrilla group, Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, on Sunday attacked military installations and the
prison in Ilobasco, a town 35 miles northeast of San Salvador in
Cabanas province, the military said.
   The two-hour attack ended when the 20 guards defending the
prison abandoned their positions. Two were wounded, officials said.
   A military bulletin said that Jose Flores, 77, who had served
five years of a 10-year term, did not escape. All the rest of the
prisoners left with the rebels.
   The FMLN simultaneously attacked goverment forces in nearby
Tejutepeque. No victims or material damages were reported there.
   Four days ago, rebels freed 50 prisoners in Santiago de Maria,
where they also inflicted heavy damage on three coffee processing
plants. Santiago is an important coffee-growing city in eastern El
Salvador.

<HEAD>No Housing, Migrant Workers Hit The Road Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of migrant workers who spent the
summer living in tents near the nation's capital are pulling up
stakes as campground closings force them back to the high
unemployment of their home states.
   Officials, meanwhile, hope to find housing alternatives before
next summer's anticipated crush of workers seeking the region's
plentiful construction jobs but who can't afford its expensive
housing. Rental units in Fairfax County average $662 a month.
   ``This problem is not going away,'' said Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va.,
who met this summer with West Virginia constituents living in a
northern Virginia park.
   ``I strongly feel that the problem has to be a shared
responsibility with the private sector,'' said Verdia L. Haywood,
deputy executive for human services in Fairfax County.
   The migrants, mostly from West Virginia but also from Ohio,
Kentucky and Texas, spent the summer on the move because of a
Fairfax County rule that requires campers to vacate a campground
for at least four days after a maximum seven-day stay.
   Linda Nolan said she, her boyfriend, her 17-year-old daughter
and her 3-year-old grandson moved 33 times in seven months to
comply with the regulation.
   They will move a 34th time _ back to West Virginia's hills _
when the Burke Lake Park campground closes for winter next weekend.
   She said she faces a winter of mostly unemployment or low-paying
jobs back home, but at least her rent will be $100 a month.
   Fairfax Vice Chairwoman Martha Pennino said she wants the county
to create a Citizens Shelter Committee, which would report back to
the Board of Supervisors with a plan in three months. She wants the
business community involved in the committee and has proposed
placing residential trailers at construction sites where many of
the workers are employed.
   She also proposed relaxing the seven-day camping limit, which is
aimed at discouraging people from living in the parks.
   Some help has materialized. One builder offered reduced rent if
migrant workers would help him renovate a house; families also were
``adopted'' by churches, said Linda Crouch, a Department of Social
Services worker.
   Nolan, 38, said she will miss her job at Betty's Azalea Ranch
and her $5.30-an-hour salary after she returns to Burton, W.Va. She
said she worked seven days a week as a laborer ``to get every penny
I can.''
   She's had her fill of eating her meals on picnic tables, but
proud that doing so has enabled her to repay a bank loan.
   ``We don't have that hanging on us now,'' she said. ``It was
worth it.''

<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem extremists holding U.S.
hostages repeated their long-standing demands for the Americans'
release in a new statement, threatening reprisal if the demands are
not met.
   The message Sunday was the second threatening statement in three
days from the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, which holds American
journalist Terry Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   The three-page typewritten Arabic statement was delivered to the
independent newspaper An-Nahar. A color photograph of Anderson was
delivered later to a Western news agency in Beirut _ the
kidnappers' normal method of authenticating statements.
   The picture showed Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, with a bushy beard and mustache. He wore a
T-shirt and looked straight into the camera. It was similar to
photographs of Anderson released released April 10, 1987, and on
Friday.
   The statement demanded:
   ``A _ Release of all our mujahedeen (holy warriors) from all
Arab and foreign jails.
   ``B _ Release of all Lebanese and Palestinian Mujahedeen from
Israeli jails in the occupied lands and its surrogates in south
Lebanon's border enclave and (Christian) east Beirut.
   ``C _ Withdrawal of all Israeli forces and their surrogates from
south Lebanon without any conditions.
   ``D _ Non-intervention in Lebanese domestic affairs and the
discontinuation of support for partitionist, isolationist and
sectarian forces in Lebanon.
   ``E _ Reconstruction of south Lebanon and Beirut. ... And
payment of war reparations to all our oppressed people in Lebanon.''
   ``In case of failure to meet these demands and continued support
of Israel's aggression against our people the United States will
pay the price very soon. This price will reflect adversely on the
fate of the hostages we hold,'' it said.
   Islamic Jihad has made similar demands in the past but never
combined them all in one statement.
   Anderson and Sutherland are among nine Americans held hostage by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Sixteen foreigners are believed held
in Lebanon. Anderson, kidnapped March 16, 1985, is the longest held
hostage.
   Islamic Jihad said its statement was to mark the fifth
anniversary of dual bombings at a U.S. Marine base and a French
paratrooper headquarters in Beirut. Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility after the Oct. 23, 1983 suicide bombing missions,
which killed 241 American servicemen and 58 Frenchmen.
   On Friday, the group threatened to ``punish'' the hostages to
avenge Israel's air strikes on Palestinian and pro-Iranian
guerrilla bases that day, which left 21 people killed and 34
wounded.
   The air raids were in apparent retaliation for a car bomb attack
that killed eight Israeli soldiers and wounded seven in Israel's
self-designated security zone in south Lebanon on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager demonstrated his talent as a
gifted pianist to show how far he has recovered since an automobile
accident last May which killed four classmates.
   Bernard James ``B.J.'' Sell of Brook, a 17-year-old St. Joseph's
College freshman, held the free recital Sunday night in the college
chapel.
   He was the only person to survive a car accident that killed
four other honor students at South Newton High School in the
northwest Indiana town of Kentland on May 21.
   The music was nearly the exact program Sell had intended to play
at his high school graduation recital the next day, said Professor
John Egan of St. Joseph's, Sell's piano teacher the past 10 years.
   On the day of his commencement, Sell was fighting for his life
at a hospital as the 59 remaining seniors struggled through the
emotional ceremony.
   Months of extensive surgery and rehabilitation followed, with
Sell receiving support from family, friends and people he had never
met.
   ``My music is my way of saying `thank you' to my family, my
friends and everyone who encouraged me during the time I was at St.
Anthony's Hospital and during the months of my recovery,'' Sell
said in a written statement.
   ``Your thoughtfulness, flowers, cards and prayers meant so much
to me. Words cannot convey how much I appreciated everything,'' he
added.
   Sell has avoided interviews since the accident that killed
Richard S. Overdeer, 18, of Goodland; Mike Kindell, 18, of Brook;
Amy Hancock, 17, and John Piegza, 18, both of Kentland.
   Police believe the five were returning from Watseka, Ill., about
20 miles west of Kentland, when Overdeer, the driver, fell asleep
and veered into a utility pole.
   Sell was, who was pinned under the dashboard, suffered multiple
injuries, including a crushed leg, a broken left arm, a broken jaw,
broken cheekbones and a broken pelvis. Doctors hope for a complete
recovery.
   Crystal Sell said her son was determined to start college on
time and that deadline drove him during his recovery. He was
dismissed from the hospital June 22, a month after the crash, and
abandoned his wheelchair Aug. 18, two days before classes began.
   A couple of weeks ago, he had surgery to remove a pin from his
leg. He faces more surgery to remove other pins next summer.
   ``I'm proud of him,'' Mrs. Sell said. ``He has been through so
much with the physical pain and mental anguish, and he's had so
much determination and courage.''
   Sell believes his piano skills are about 95 percent of what they
were before the accident, said Egan, who considers Sell a gifted
student.
   ``He's incredibly good,'' Egan said. ``I've often called him my
Mozart.''
   Sell tires more quickly than he once did and his left hand may
not yet be able to do what it could before the accident, Egan said,
but in another sense the accident has made him a better pianist.
   ``I'd say he has surpassed where he was before. He has a far
deeper set of experiences and he grew as a person. It shows in his
music,'' Egan said.
   ``He's an exceedingly popular young man. I think everything
about him cries out that it's great to be alive,'' Egan said. ``I
think he's the kind of kid who could come here and major in
anything and do exceedingly well.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teamsters drivers have reached a tentative
agreement with film and television producers to settle their
3-week-old strike, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   The Times, citing unidentified sources close to the talks, said
the agreement was reached Sunday during talks at Grenelefe Resort
about 40 miles from Orlando, Fla.
   Negotiations resumed there last week because the Teamsters
executive board had been meeting at the resort.
   The newspaper did not disclose details of the agreement.
   Local Teamsters and producers representatives said they were
unaware of any possible settlement late Sunday.
   ``I wish it was true,'' said a man answering the strike hotline
at Local 399 late Sunday, who declined to give his name. ``They're
still picketing.''
   ``I don't know anything about it,'' said Herb Steinberg,
spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Televion Producers.
   The settlement is subject to approval by North Hollywood-based
Local 399, which represents the 2,200 striking studio drivers and
plans to meet sometime later this week, the Times said.
   According to the newspaper, those present at the Florida talks
included William J. McCarthy, the Teamsters' national president;
Local 399 president Earl Bush, and Nicholas Counter, president of
the producers' alliance.
   The Teamsters, who transport actors, equipment and props for
producers, walked out Oct. 3 just as Hollywood production was
gearing up after scriptwriters ended their five-month strike in
August. Their strike has had less of an impact on production than
the scripterwriters'.
   Joining the Teamsters on strike are 1,000 members of the
electricians and the laborers unions.
   Key issues in the strike include include overtime rules for
weekend work, salaries, wages for out-of-town film and television
production, studio seniority and guidelines for the making of
non-union films. Some Teamster drivers were being asked to take a
pay cut to $14 an hour from $16.61.
   The producers contend the Teamsters must help fight mounting
production costs and increased competition to stop producers from
leaving Southern California for less expensive locales.

<HEAD>Million-Dollar Reward Offered For Identity of Secret Client</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a man killed by a
hit-and-run driver have offered a $1 million reward and appealed to
a national television audience for information that might reveal
the driver's identity.
   Mark Baltes was struck by a white Buick on an oceanside drive
here and dragged 60 feet to his death more than 2{ years ago.
   Attorney Barry Krischer says the driver approached him for
counsel the day after the accident, but he has won court permission
to keep the name a secret on the grounds of attorney-client
confidentiality.
   Krischer again refused to identify the driver when interviewed
on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes,'' broadcast Sunday night.
   A tearful Mildred Baltes also appeared on the show and said she
was determined to find the driver so she can put her son's tragedy
behind her.
   Mrs. Baltes and her ex-husband, Joseph Baltes, say they must win
a $6 million lawsuit against the driver before they can pay off any
reward money.
   That suit was filed in February over the March 9, 1986,
accident. It is pending in Palm Beach County Circuit Court while
state and private investigators continue trying to track down the
driver.
   On Oct. 12, Circuit Judge Timothy Poulton said Krischer did not
have to reveal the driver's name because it is protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   ``This criminal is out there laughing at the system, hiding
behind the attorney-client privilege,'' says Joseph Farish,
attorney for Baltes' family. He devised the reward plan, announced
on Friday, ``in order to make incentive for someone to come forward
and expedite this mystery.''
   Farish conceded that if someone comes forward with information
leading to the driver's identity, the tipster would have to wait
for a favorable jury verdict in the lawsuit.
   Richard Lubin, who represents Krischer, said he is indifferent
to Farish's tactics, as long as Farish does not trample on the
judge's ruling.

   A construction worker accused of plotting
to have his mother killed with a rattlesnake borrowed $300 from her
to pay the snake handler, police said.
   Tipped off by a Florida snake handler, police arrested Reginald
Pope on Thursday in his 62-year-old mother's Alabama home. Pope is
in the Marengo, Ala., County Jail on a charge of conspiracy to
commit murder.
   ``He must have had this idea in his head for some time because
he had all the details planned out,'' said Escambia County
sheriff's Cpl. Wendall Hall.
   Authorities didn't identify the snake handler, but said he told
Escambia sheriff's Deputy Ed Hudson about the proposal after
meeting Pope at a Pensacola restaurant more than a week ago.
   ``They started talking, and when Pope found out that the man
trapped rattlesnakes as a hobby, he said, `Well, you're just the
man I've been looking for,''' Hall said. ``Then Pope told him he
wanted to hire someone with a rattlesnake to kill his mother.''
   Authorities said the snake handler went to Alabama, taking a
snake with him, in order to fool Pope into thinking he was
cooperating in the plot.
   ``He wanted the rattlesnake to bite her on the neck at the
jugular vein so the venom would go straight to the heart or the
brain,'' Hall said.
   The motive apparently was money; Pope was the sole beneficiary
of her insurance policies and will, Hall said.
   ``He even borrowed $300 from his mother to give to the
rattlesnake handler after he saw the snake,'' Hall said.
   Alabama authorities got the mother out of the house, and Pope
was arrested just before the snake was to be let loose when he
walked into the house.

<TEXT>
   For weeks it seemed all of Poland was
waiting for the ``round table.'' Now it has finally arrived.
   A specially made table 29 feet in diameter has been delivered to
the Jablonna Palace for the expected talks between representatives
of authorities and the opposition, a furniture maker said.
   The talks could begin as early as this week.
   The doughnut-shaped table is hollow in the center and can seat
more than 50 people, said a Polish media source. It comprises 14
sections, is made of pine and is covered with a veneer, the source
said.
   The manager of the Warsaw Factory of Artistic Furniture, Henryk
Lewandowski, said the table took two weeks to manufacture and was
delivered this morning to the government palace just outside
Warsaw. He said he was not authorized to give further details.
   Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak and Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa agreed at a meeting Aug. 31 to hold ``round-table''
discussions that will cover broad social questions, including
Solidarity's future and economic and political pluralism in Poland.
   Both sides say they want the talks to begin as soon as possible,
and blame the other for delays.
   The government Saturday said it wants another meeting between
Kiszczak and Walesa to remove last-minute obstacles to the talks,
including disputes over certain individuals nominated by the
opposition to participate.
   Walesa says such a preparatory meeting is unnecessary because
Solidarity will not change its proposed delegation to the talks,
and any other technical matters can be cleared up through
lower-level intermediaries.

   A car bomb exploded today
outside a shopping center in the coal-mining town of Witbank,
killing two men and injuring 42 people, police said.
   Capt. Ruben Bloomberg, a police spokesman, said the explosion
occurred at 8:14 a.m. in the parking lot of a shopping center in
downtown Witbank, about 60 miles east of Johannesburg.
   Windows in nearby buildings were shattered by the blast, and
about 16 cars were damaged.
   Bloomberg initially said a man and a woman were killed. He later
said both victims were black men. He said the injured included 23
whites and 19 blacks, including a woman who lost her left foot.
   Bombings and hand-grenade attacks have occurred in South Africa
at a rate of more than one a day since early September. Police say
most of the attacks are part of an intimidation campaign waged by
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement to
disrupt nationwide municipal elections scheduled for Wednesday.
   The ANC, which is fighting to end white rule, has said it seeks
to undermine the elections but has neither claimed nor denied
responsibility for specific bombings.
   Police said today that doctors operated on a suspected ANC
guerrilla who was arrested Satuday while allegedly carrying a
limpet mine toward a ceremony presided over by Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   The suspect, who has not been identified, complained of
dizziness after his arrest and later underwent an operation at Cape
Town's Groote Schuur Hospital for a brain hemorrhage, police said.
   An investigation into the reasons for the man's hospitalization
was being conducted, police said.
   The man was arrested shortly after Vlok arrived to open a new
police station in Crossroads, a shantytown that the government
tried several times to destroy before making it a legal township.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The country's 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Students Protest Electronic Lunchroom Monitor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 90 elementary school students who
objected to an electronic monitor that buzzes and flashes when they
get too loud in the lunchroom won't have to endure it if they stay
reasonably quiet, the school's principal says.
   ``I think the light stinks,'' said Richmond School sixth-grader
Scott Doyon. ``It's a big waste of money. I think the aides do a
good job of making us quiet.''
   He was among fifth- and sixth-graders who submitted a
handwritten petition last week asking that the monitor be removed.
   The monitor is equipped with a noise-measuring device that scans
the lunchroom.
   As many as 175 pack into one of four daily lunch shifts at the
705-student school, Principal Pasquale Nappi said.
   With relative quiet, the monitor is green. If it gets louder,
the signal changes to yellow and the monitor emits a loud
electronic beep. More noise, and the red light comes on and the
monitor buzzes.
   If the red light blinks on more than five times during a lunch
shift, the lights are switched off and the students eat in the dark.
   Additional red lights mean the students lose a 10-minute recess
period after lunch.
   Nappi, bowing to the the fifth- and sixth-graders' protests, has
ruled that they won't have to eat under the monitor's continuous
scrutiny as long as they remain reasonably quiet.
   But first- through fourth-graders will remain under the
monitor's electronic supervision, Nappi said.
   The Richmond Parent-Teacher Organization bought the device in
the spring for $450. It was installed in time for the first day of
school last month.
   The acquisition was a reaction to complaints from lunchroom
aides that noise in the cafeteria, which also serves as an
auditorium and a gymnasium, was intolerable at times.

   Two Israeli warplanes blasted a military
base of a Syrian-backed militia in southeast Lebanon with four
rockets today, setting it afire and wounding one militiaman, police
said.
   Israel's military command said the base was destroyed.
   Police said the attack demolished a one-story structure used as
a base by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. The attack on Beit
Lehia, nine miles north of Israel's self-designated security zone
in south Lebanon, also damaged four houses, police said.
   The 1:30 p.m. attack was Israel's 17th air raid in Lebanon this
year and the second since Wednesday, when a suicide car bomber of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia killed eight Israeli soldiers and
wounded seven.
   In Jerusalem, Israel's military command issued a statement
saying all planes returned safely to base and pilots reported
destroying the target, which served the guerrillas as a base for
conducting raids.
   Lebanese police said ambulances and fire engines were sent to
the base, near the town of Mashghara in south-central Lebanon.
   On Friday, Israeli jet fighters bombed Palestinian and Shiite
guerrilla bases in south Lebanon, killing 21 people and wounding 34.
   Earlier today, Israeli troops and allied militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army stormed a house in south Lebanon and freed a family
held hostage by Shiite Moslem guerrillas, the militia's radio
station said.
   The Voice of the South said all seven Shiite guerrillas who had
broken into the house of an unidentified militiamen and held this
family hostage were detained.
   The incident occurred in the village of Kfar Kela, site of the
car bombing Wednesday.
   About 12 miles northeast of Kfar Kela, Israeli troops and SLA
militiamen captured two Palestinian guerrilla infiltrators in the
foothills of Mount Hermon shortly after daybreak, security sources
said.
   Israeli troops and SLA militiamen killed four guerrillas of the
Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine on the slopes
of Mount Hermon in the south Lebanon security zone on Sunday.
   Israel and the predominantly Christian SLA maintain control of
the six-by-10-mile border enclave to protect northern Israeli
settlements from guerrilla attack.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson joined a symbolic reunion
of civil rights leaders at the conclusion of a tribute to the Rev.
Joseph Lowery's 40 years as a United Methodist minister.
   ``It was like a homecoming,'' Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, said of Sunday night's event,
which reunited many of the men who made civil rights history during
the Sixties.
   A rift developed in the SCLC after the 1968 death of its leader,
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and relations between Jackson and
other King aides became chilly and distant.
   All that was set aside when Jackson marched onstage Sunday.
   The two-time presidential candidate was greeted warmly by
Lowery, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young; King's widow, Coretta Scott
King; the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, King's best friend; and Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., a former leader in the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee.
   Young told an audience estimated at 2,000 people that King
``would be proud'' of Jackson's political accomplishments.
   Jackson said he has been a ``direct beneficiary'' of Lowery's
philosophy, and described Lowery as ``common sense dressed in work
clothes'' whose leadership achieved social change in the 1970s and
1980s.
   ``I respect you Brother Joe, in all seriousness,'' said Jackson,
who flew to Atlanta Sunday for Lowery's anniversary after stops in
Boston and New York. ``I was determined to be here tonight. My
sense of history obligates me to be here.''
   Jackson took the opportunity to blast Vice President George
Bush, saying the Republican presidential nominee, if elected, would
appoint federal judges who would jeopardize further progress in
civil rights.
   Jackson encouraged the audience to vote for Democrat Michael
Dukakis and his running mate, Lloyd Bentsen.
   Other leaders praised Lowery as a foot soldier who carried his
ministry from an Alabama ghetto to the forefront of a movement that
shaped the nation's moral conscience.
   Lowery encouraged the audience to vote in each election,
pointing out that blacks have ``come too far, marched too long,
bled too profusely and died too young'' so that others may have
that right.
   He said the tribute was a ``tremendous humbling experience.''
   ``I'm grateful to Jesse,'' Lowery said, ``particularly because
he had such a grueling schedule and he juggled it and compounded it
to be here.''

   The last guests were ushered
out, staff members took pictures and cried and disbelieving
tourists were turned away when the stately Empress Hotel closed for
the first time in its 80-year history.
   ``Where else serves afternoon tea?'' one woman asked the doorman
anxiously Sunday about a tradition that is part of this provincial
capital's heritage.
   The 416-room hotel will be closed for nearly six months for a
multimillion-dollar facelift, including restoration of the Crystal
Ballroom and refinishing of antique furniture.
   ``It's been a bit of an emotional helter-skelter for the last
week,'' said general manager Ian Barbour. ``It's pretty traumatic
but we know we are closing for the right reasons.''
   A few staff members will continue to work during the closure and
some have moved temporarily to other Canadian Pacific hotels, but
the majority will take a six-month holiday.
   Fred Borg, a front office employee, said one of the most
difficult tasks has been trying to explain that there won't be a
Christmas package this year.
   ``Many customers are used to coming here every year,'' he said.
``It's almost like a pilgrimmage.''
   He said many Christmas regulars were referred to the Hotel
Vancouver, in Vancouver, British Columbia, which has been given
Empress secrets for a traditional Christmas.

<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, seeking
improved economic relations with the Soviets, met today with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for their first formal talks since Gorbachev
became Soviet leader.
   Kohl, who arrived in Moscow today for a four-day official visit,
was greeted at Vnukovo airport by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov,
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Defense Minister Dmitri T.
Yazov, and other top Soviet officials, the official news agency
Tass said.
   The West German leader and his wife Hannelore were received by
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa in St. George's Hall of the Kremlin,
Tass said. The two leaders then held talks in the St. Catherine's
Hall, the agency said.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Defense Minister Rupert
Scholz and other Cabinet members were in the West German delegation
that accompanied Kohl from Bonn.
   The development of economic ties likely will top the discussions
during Kohl's visit, as West German businesses seek to profit from
what they say are growing opportunities created by Gorbachev's
economic reforms.
   Projected joint ventures range from the development of the
mineral-rich Kola peninsula in the northwestern part of the Soviet
Union to the construction of factories in various parts of the
communist nation.
   Other items on the agenda include European disarmament,
East-West relations, ties between West Germany and Moscow-allied
East Germany, and the fate of some 2 million Soviets of German
ethnic origin.
   On Oct. 14, the West German Embassy in Moscow said Gorbachev and
Kohl would sign an accord on ``scientific cooperation in space.''
The embassy gave no details.
   The embassy also said Kohl and Gorbachev would sign agreements
on agricultural cooperation and environmental protection and that
``other agreements will be signed by private firms with Soviet
agencies.''
   The West Germans are looking for an improved political climate
in central Europe that Bonn hopes will translate into the
willingness of communist East Germany to relax barriers that have
kept family and friends apart since Germany was divided just after
World War II.
   In his public appearances this year, Kohl has praised
Gorbachev's reforms, advocated Western economic assistance to the
Soviets and stressed the importance of having good relations with
the Kremlin.
   Kohl last met Gorbachev in March 1985 when he attended the
funeral of Communist Party general secretary Konstantin Chernenko.
Gorbachev became party general secretary after Chernenko's death.
He became president less than a month ago.
   Relations between the two World War II enemies, soured by Kohl's
1983 agreement to deploy U.S. Pershing medium-range missiles in
West Germany, have improved markedly since the Soviet Union and the
United States last year signed a treaty to ban such missiles.

<HEAD>Faulty Part Forced Navy To Abandon 500 Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is investigating an
Orange County company whose faulty production of a critical part
forced the Navy to abandon 500 Phoenix missiles worth $425 million,
the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   Micronics International in Brea is suspected of using a
substandard production process for making the missile's fuze, its
safety and arming mechanism, according to the newspaper.
   Rodney Hansen, special agent in charge of the Defense Department
inspector general's office in Santa Ana, confirmed that it is
conducting a criminal investigation into the concern.
   The Phoenix _ the principal weapon for the Navy's F-14 fighter _
is a radar-guided missile designed to fire at enemy aircraft 100
miles away.
   But the supply of $850,000 missiles is useless because of the
failure of the $4,500 part, which fires the warhead and also
prevents premature firing of the missile, Navy officials told the
Times.
   The company began manufacturing proper fuzes in February, the
Navy said. Those are expected to be installed in the warehoused
missiles by next year's end.
   E.W. Ritter, Micronics' business manager in Phoenix, said the
company had been subpoenaed early this month for documents
involving the missile program, but said they weren't told they were
the subject of a criminal investigation.
   Company officials previously placed the blame for the fuze
failures on Navy designs. And an investigation previously conducted
by the General Accounting Office concluded that the Navy shared
responsibility for the manufacturing problems.
   The company, a subsidiary of La Jolla-based Precision Aerotech,
refused to comment about its work on the Phoenix program.
   Micronics contracts over the last three years with the Navy Air
Systems Command for the fuzes totaled nearly $5.4 million.
   The company is accused of using a process called ``sand
casting'' to form the devices. In that process, sand is used to
mold the hot metal. Products resulting from this process have a
pitted, porous surface that fail to meet contract specifications.
   According to the Times, the Navy required the company to use a
process called ``investment casting'' in which molten metal is
poured into a wax mold to produce a smoothly finished product that
can meet precise specifications.

   Two lifeguards freed a 25-foot gray
whale that became trapped in a weighted gill net while migrating
south, authorities said.
   Lifeguards Jason Hudson and Alan Powder hacked away at the net
for 45 minutes on Saturday and were able to clear all but a small
portion of the net fouling one of the endangered gray whale's fukes.
   The whale then continued its southward migration and whale
experts at Sea World in San Diego were alerted to be on the lookout
for it, said Capt. Randall Davis of the state Bureau of Marine
Safety.
   California gray whales migrate along the Pacific coast of North
America from the arctic region to Baja California for spawning.
Marine and wildlife officers occasionally are called to attempt
rescues.
   In Alaska, rescuers continued their efforts today to free two
gray whales that became trapped in Arctic Ocean ice while migrating
south.

<HEAD>Study Predicts Rising Municipal Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent and future environmental regulations
could impose significant costs on small towns, farmers and small
businesses and mean increases averaging $100 to $170 in municipal
fees per household by 1996, according to a study by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   An in-house EPA committee report to Administrator Lee M. Thomas
suggests that the agency and state governments might have to
consider new ways to help those affected by some 85 major rules
involving everything from pesticide use to controls on dry cleaning
solvents.
   The committee made no attempt to assess the benefits of the
regulations, but cautioned they must not be ignored.
   It suggested that federal, state and local governments consider,
among other things, ``public education'' as one helpful tactic.
   ``Making people aware of the potential net benefits to be gained
by investing in environmental protection should provide a better
forum for assessing the merits of the project,'' the committee
wrote.
   It said the agency may need to encourage other tactics such as
more technical assistance, changes in fee structures, grants to
particularly poor communities and incentives to cooperate with
others, as in regional water systems embracing several communities.
   Warning that cost estimates couldn't be derived for several
important regulations such as asbestos control in schools, the
study said the average household nationwide by 1996 might have to
pay $100 a year more in charges, fees and taxes because of
regulations on drinking water, waste water treatment and solid
waste disposal.
   The cost was greater at the extremes _ an average of $170 more
in communities under 2,500 residents and $160 in communities of at
least 250,000.
   In 20 percent of the smaller places, current charges could more
than double, but nationwide only 2 percent of the households would
see an increase that large.
   People living in smaller communities generally have lower
incomes, and the study estimated current and future costs for these
environmental services could total 0.7 percent of household income
for towns of fewer than 2,500 people compared with 0.5 percent for
larger places.
   Based on the finances of a sample of 207 municipalities, the
study estimated that 21 percent to 30 percent of communities of
fewer than 2,500 people could have trouble financing capital
expenditures the regulations are expected to require. Only 3
percent to 7 percent of larger communities were expected to have
similar problems.
   No such sample was possible for farms, so the committee examined
the books of typical farms in ``average'' and ``vulnerable''
financial conditions for thee types of operations _ an Illinois
corn and soybean operation, of which there are about 31,000; a
Mississippi farm growing cotton and soybeans, of which there are
about 1,800; and a Kansas farm producing wheat and cattle, of which
there are about 20,000.
   Assuming that the agency tried to promulgate regulations with
minimum costs and that not every farmer in average financial
condition had to meet every requirement _ a kind of ``average
impact'' scenario _ income before depreciation would fall by 3
percent for the Mississippi and Kansas farms and by 0.7 percent for
the Illinois farm.
   If all such farms had to meet all requirements, income would
fall by 8 percent for the Illinois farm, 18 percent for the
Mississippi farm and 24 percent for the Kansas farm.
   In the worst case, EPA would promulgate regulations bearing
heavy costs that all farmers would have to meet _ a highly
improbable upper bound, since only a few farms would be so heavily
affected. The Illinois farm would lose 26 percent of its income,
the Mississippi farm would lose 24 percent and the Kansas farm
would lose 84 percent.
   A ``vulnerable'' Kansas farm with current negative net cash
income will go out of business in 1996 anyway, but a year earlier
under some possible scenarios, the report said.
   The committee also examined a few speciality crops and concluded
that even ``average impact'' fungicide restrictions could have
dramatic effects on apple growers in Michigan and New York, but not
Washington state.
   If the agency goes all-out with high-cost regulations, New York
growers could see a drop of 60 percent in their current $220 net
return per acre, and Michigan growers could lose 84 percent of
their $80 per acre. Washington returns would barely change from
$330, increasing by 0.2 percent because apple prices would rise.
   Relatively few non-farm small businesses will be affected by
EPA's regulations. Seventy percent of the nation's 3.5 small
businesses _ those with fewer than 50 employees _ are in
non-polluting fields such as wholesale and retail trade, finance or
other services.
   But the committee said it was able to identify several
industries where costs to comply with future regulations had a good
chance of eating up either 30 percent of annual profits or
requiring capital expenditures of more than 30 percent of the
owners' investment.
   Most prominent are dry cleaners, who may be faced with expensive
controls on solvent emissions, and service stations, where ``only
the strongest'' financially would be able to meet costs of cleaning
up any leaking underground storage tanks.
   Small electroplaters, wood preservers and pesticide formulators
could have difficulty meeting toxic chemical regulations. If they
have leaking underground tanks, farm supply stores and trucking
companies also could be vulnerable.

<HEAD>Runway Confusion Leads To Nine Errors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airport workers have painted lines and
installed strobe lights to separate taxiways and a runway that
pilots say were so confusing they nearly caused nine collisions of
Delta jets in the past year.
   Federal records show the latest incident of pilot confusion at
Dallas-Fort Worth International over where the aircraft parking
ramp outside Delta Air Lines' terminal ended and a taxiway began
was Aug. 31, the same day another Delta plane crashed on takeoff.
   In that incident, the pilot of Delta Flight 297 mistakenly
turned left onto a runway and into the path of Delta Flight 638,
which was cleared for takeoff, according to Federal Aviation
Administration records.
   ``It was pretty scary. That could have easily been a terrible
accident,'' said tower manager Norm Scroggins. He said it was the
only time two planes reached the runway at the same time.
   A tower controller spotted Flight 297 on the runway just after
it turned, and told Flight 297 to halt while another controller
told Flight 638 to abort takeoff, records show.
   An FAA investigative report indicates Flight 638 came to a stop
a few yards from Flight 297.
   ``It was a relatively low-speed abort, but the pilot decided to
let his brakes cool for about 10 minutes before heading back up the
runway,'' Scroggins said.
   A few hours later, Delta Flight 1141, bound for Salt Lake City,
crashed just after takeoff, killing 14 people. That crash is still
under investigation.
   The runway confusion first occurred in October 1987 after the
airport covered grass islands between the parking apron and inner
taxiway with concrete.
   ``A lot of pilots use the grass to guide them,'' said Richard
Petit, the airport's senior director of planning and engineering.
``Problem was, there were a bunch more who cut the corners short
and their landing gear went into the grass.''
   ``Because there is no grass between the ramp and the inner
taxiway, we had several pilots who believed the runway was the
outer taxiway,'' Scroggins said.
   In recent weeks, workers have painted thick black stripes
outlined with yellow to mark the inner taxiway and have identified
the taxiway with 10-foot letters and strobe lights.
   Officials said procedures for directing Delta flights to the
runways also have changed, so planes avoid Taxiway 29, which leads
directly from the ramp area to Runway 17L, the first of two
parallel runways on the airport's east side.
   Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram
the airline has hand-delivered notices to all of its pilots
alerting them about the taxiway.

   Typhoon Ruby roared across the
Philippines today with heavy rain and winds topping 100 mph,
causing mud slides and tidal surges that left thousands homeless.
Officials said at least 13 people died.
   The military reported another 30 people were missing and feared
dead in a storm-related bus accident and that an inter-island
vessel with 481 passengers and crew was missing in stormy seas.
   The coast guard said the missing vessel, the Marilyn, reported
engine trouble en route from Manila to Tacloban City and could have
taken shelter in an isolated harbor. It was last reported about 200
miles southeast of Manila.
   The government warned of more flooding as the storm approached
Manila. At 4 p.m., the storm sustained winds of 102 mph and its
center was moving northwest at 16 mph toward densely populated
central Luzon Island.
   ``This is one of the worst typhoons this year,'' said Juanito
Lirios, deputy weather service director. ``Manila is in great
danger. Let us not take chances. If we do not take care then there
could be a great loss of lives.''
   Some flights were canceled and schools were closed in Manila.
   The U.S. military's television network reported wind gusts up to
140 mph. All six U.S. military bases in the Philippines were put on
maximum storm alert.
   States of emergency were declared in some areas of the southern
Mindanao Island, and thousands of people were evacuated.
   Ruby is the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to hit the
Philippines this year and the second in four days. There were
conflicting reports on casualties because the storm knocked out
communications in the affected areas.
   Rodrigo Roldan, civil defense director on Panay Island, said at
least five people were killed today when a bus carrying about 90
people careened off a bridge during heavy winds and rain and
plunged into a river.
   The army said another 30 passengers were missing and presumed
dead. The state-run Philippines News Agency said most of the
passengers were sleeping when the accident occurred and were unable
to escape.
   Roldan said at least 19 people were rescued.
   Simeon Licayan, executive secretary of Cagayan de Oro, said
seven people, mostly children, were killed Sunday when tornados
prompted by the advancing typhoon struck remote villages near the
city 500 miles south of Manila.
   Licayan said a state of emergency was declared for Cagayan de
Oro, a Mindanao Island port city of 230,000, and that about 250
houses and a major bridge had been washed away.
   Col. Triumfo Augustin, constabulary commander in the area,
estimated 20,000 people were homeless. Officials also declared a
state of emergency throughout the western district of Mindanao.
   The government's Department of Social Welfare said its latest
report from Cagayan de Oro listed seven dead, including six
children and a pregnant woman.
   The Red Cross said a person was killed Sunday in storm-related
flooding in Pagadian City, 500 miles south of Manila. The state
news agency said five others died in Pagadian, but complete
casualty reports were delayed because the storm knocked out
communications.
   Civil Defense officials reported about 150 houses had been
flooded in low-lying areas near Cebu City, about 350 miles
southeast of Manila. No deaths were reported.
   In Manila, officials at Ninoy Aquino International Airport said
international flights were operating normally but all domestic
flights were canceled.
   The coast guard ordered inter-island shipping suspended.
   At the U.S. Clark Air Base, 80 miles north of Manila,
spokeswoman Lt. Donna Eggleston said some aircraft were to be
evacuated late today.
   Schools were closed at the American bases and the U.S. military
television station said only ``mission-essential personnel'' were
on duty.
   The Philippines News Agency said strong waves washed away scores
of houses in the province along the shoreline at Legazpi, but gave
no report of casualties.
   Ricardo Dy, Legazpi disaster coordinator, said about 3,000
people were evacuated from coastal districts near the city about
225 miles southeast of Manila.
   On Friday, Typhoon Pat struck central Luzon, causing widespread
crop damage but no deaths.

   Police said today a U.S. organization was
the intended recipient of the photographs of American hostages in
Lebanon that were found in a Lebanese woman's luggage at Milan's
airport.
   The woman was supposed to deliver the pictures and a handwritten
letter bearing hostage Alann Steen's name to an Italian arms
trader, Aldo Anghessa, police said. The photographs were of Steen,
American reporter Terry Anderson and a third man.
   ``Anghessa acted as a go-between, between the two parties. One
party was a Lebanese organization,'' said Achille Serra, head of
Milan's anti-terrorist police.
   He said the other group was American, but refused to elaborate
on the identity of either organization or say if the U.S.
government was involved.
   The newspaper Il Giornale of Milan reported without attribution
today that Anghessa was to give the photos and letter to U.S.
diplomats, but the arrest of the woman spoiled the operation. The
U.S. Embassy declined comment on the report.
   Serra said police do not know if Anghessa was part of an effort
to free the hostages, as Italian media has speculated.
   Anghessa, who has been linked to Italian and Swiss secret
services and was at the center of an international arms scandal
last year, was questioned by police after the woman's arrest
Thursday after arriving at Milan's Linate Airport from Beirut.
Anghessa was released, but police planned to interrogate him again,
Serra said.
   The Lebanese woman, identified as Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36,
was jailed and charged with carrying $1,000 in counterfeit U.S.
bills and 50 grams of heroin, police said.
   The woman said Anghessa was not connected to the drug shipment,
police said.
   The Rome daily La Repubblica reported Sunday that Anghessa had
ties to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said: ``There is no, repeat no, record
of Anghessa having ever assisted DEA officers in Italy.''
   In an interview published in today's edition of the Rome-based
newspaper Il Messaggero, Anghessa was quoted as saying he was
``willing to cooperate with this investigation but I swear I know
absolutely nothing.''
   Police were examining the photographs to determine whether they
were originals or copies of newspaper pictures, Serra said.
   Serra said police have ruled out that hostage Thomas Sutherland
was the man in the third photo. The man, who police earlier
believed to be Sutherland, has not been identified.
   Police have asked U.S. authorities for samples of Steen's
handwriting to authenticate the letter bearing his name, said
Fortunato Finoli, deputy director of the anti-terrorist police.
   Anghessa, 44, who has dual Swiss-Italian nationality, was
arrested following the 1987 seizure of a Lebanese cargo ship off
Bari in southern Italy. Police said the ship was carrying drugs and
weapons for use by the Mafia and Middle East terrorists.
   Anghessa was charged with international drug trafficking and
organizing groups for illegal export of weapons and terrorist ends.
The charges were later dropped.
   The Lebanese woman said she was a courier and denied knowledge
of the photos, letter or other documents written in Italian that
were hidden in her suitcase, police said.
   She told police an Italian man was to receive the photographs
and documents. Police traced Anghessa through a telephone number in
the woman's purse, newspapers said.
   Authorities were trying to decipher the coded documents, Finoli
said. The letter bearing Steen's name was written in English and
``expressed thanks to everyone who was working for his
liberation,'' Finoli said.
   Anderson and Sutherland are held by pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad,
while Steen's kidnapping was claimed by the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   In Beirut on Sunday, Islamic Jihad distributed a photo of
Anderson and repeated its demand for the release of its guerrillas
from all foreign jails and the Israeli pullout from south Lebanon
in exchange for the hostages' freedom. It threatened reprisal if
the demands were not met.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was abducted three months later. He is of
Fort Collins, Colo.
   Steen, of Boston, was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 at Beirut
University College, where he taught.
   Nine Americans are held by pro-Iranian extremist factions linked
to Hezbollah, or Party of God. Others believed held are three
Britons, an Irishman and an Italian.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Postpones Start Of Campaign Due To Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto has
postponed the start of her November election campaign becaused of a
kidney infection, family sources said today.
   They said treatment for the illness would keep her at her
Karachi home for a few more days.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35-year-old leader of the left-leaning Pakistan
People's Party, had planned an eight-city swing by train through
Punjab province, starting today at their family home of Larkana in
Sind province to the south.
   She developed a fever Sunday and flew back from Larkana to
Karachi on her doctor's advice, family members said.
   It was to be her campaign debut for National Assembly elections
scheduled Nov. 16 and provincial assembly polls three days later.
She had been recuperating from the birth of her first child Sept.
21.
   Ms. Bhutto's main rival is the conservative Pakistan Muslim
League of former Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo.
   About 1,370 candidates from 20 parties are contesting 217 seats.
Ms. Bhutto's party is believed to be Pakistan's largest party but
it has not participated in any national elections her father,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, won the 1977 polls.
   The army chief, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, claimed the 1977
elections were rigged and ousted Prime Minister Bhutto in a coup.
   Zia had Bhutto hanged two years later for allegedly plotting to
kill a political foe.
   Zia ruled for 11 years until his death Aug. 17 in a plane crash.
Investigators concluded the crash, which also killed U.S.
Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others, probably was caused by
sabotage.
   Senate Chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan now is Pakistan's head of
state.
   Political observers predict Ms. Bhutto's party may be strong
enough to garner a simple majority in the new legislature, but
several right-wing Moslem parties have said they would oppose
having a woman as prime minister.

   A 13-year-old girl who became the subject of
a nationwide search after she was abducted six years ago has been
living with her grandfather and is in good condition, officials
said.
   Authorities in Huntington Beach, Calif., arrested Leroy Freeman
for investigation of kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution, Huntington Beach police Lt. John Foster said.
   Lucas County Juvenile Court Judge Andy Devine said he would
decide today whether Karen Creswell will be granted custody of her
daughter, Charity, who was found Friday in Huntington Beach.
   Devine on Saturday gave emergency temporary custody of the girl
to the Lucas County Children's Services Board pending the outcome
of today's hearing. A doctor and the Children's Services Board will
decide whether she and her mother should be reunited before the
hearing.
   Devine said he did not return Charity immediately to her mother
based on ``information that was supplied to me that indicated this
custody action was necessary.'' He would not discuss the
information in detail.
   The girl was abducted in September 1982. Authorities had
searched for her in Ohio and New Mexico before Freeman was arrested
Friday in California. Detectives had gone to see him about an
automobile repossession and the girl answered the door, Foster said.
   Charity was not being held captive and appeared to be in good
physical shape, Foster said.
   ``Thank goodness, this may finally be coming to an end,'' said
Victor J. Gonzalez, an attorney for the girl's mother. ``It's been
a long, long ordeal.''

   Two Czech climbers fell to their deaths
in the Himalayas and four Czech members of another expedition were
missing on Mount Everest, the Tourism Ministry reported today.
   Also in the Himalayas, two Icelanders have been missing for six
days on Mount Pumori, the ministry said. It said the search for the
two had been abandoned.
   The ministry said the two Czechs who died _ Leous Horka and Petr
Gribek, both 45 and from Ostrava _ fell to their deaths on Mount
Tilicho Four.
   The two members of the 19-man expedition reached the top of the
23,399-foot Tilicho last Tuesday. They spent the night on the
summit and began descending the next morning, but slipped and fell
to their deaths about 2,000 feet below the summit.
   Another member of the team, Palecek Ludvik, 32, also from
Ostrava, left the expedition's base camp at 15,088 feet Thursday
and reached the summit of Tilicho on Friday, the ministry said.
   On his way down, Ludvik discovered the bodies of the two Czechs
hanging from their climbing ropes. He returned to base camp
Saturday.
   Four Czech members of another expedition have been missing since
Oct. 17 after they scaled Mount Everest, the Tourism Ministry said.
   The ministry said it received a message from the expedition's
base camp reporting the disappearance of Jozef Just, 33; Dusan
Becik, 34; Jaroslav Jasko, 27; and Peter Bozik, 34; all from
Bratislava.
   On Oct. 17, Just reached the top of 29,028-foot Mount Everest
and reportedly stayed for 20 minutes before starting his descent.
   The other Czechs climbing with Just reached 28,750 feet but
turned back because of high winds, the ministry said.
   The 14-member expedition included eight Czechs, five New
Zealanders and an American.
   The missing Icelanders _ Poesteiwn Gudjowsson and Kristinn
Runarsson, both 27 and from Reykjavik _ were last seen by other
members of their five-man team as they were heading for the summit
of Mount Pumori from 20,336 feet on Tuesday.
   The two had planned to make their assault on the 23,488-foot
peak Wednesday. Gudjowsson was one of the leaders of the
British-Icelandic expedition.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to update with arrival at court, picks up

   Rep. Pat Swindall said he was in good spirits and
confident of acquittal when he arrived at federal court today for
his speeded-up trial on charges of lying to a grand jury about
seeking an $850,000 mortgage.
   ``I have absolutely no problem when it comes to the truth. I
know the truth is on my side,'' he told reporters.
   Swindall's perjury trial was to start at 9:30 a.m., but was
delayed.
   The 38-year-old, two-term Republican congressman has contended
that any discrepancies in his grand jury testimony were memory
lapses. While waiting for the trial to begin Swindall joked with
reporters, and at one point in discussing his defense plans, he
qualified a statement by saying: ``But my memory is not that good.''
   The perjury trial stems from Swindall's negotiation of a loan
with a man he knew as Mike Martinez, who actually was undercover
Internal Revenue Service agent Michael Mullaney.
   Swindall told the grand jury in February that he was suspicious,
even afraid, of Martinez, but said his talks with Martinez never
gave him reason to go to authorities.
   The government contends Mullaney gave Swindall plenty of reason
to believe the $850,000 home mortgage loan he was seeking would
come from the drug trade.
   The prosecution claims Swindall lied to the grand jury about his
dealings with Mullaney and Charles LeChasney, who has pleaded
guilty to money laundering charges which do not involve the
congressman.
   Swindall, who is representing himself, has said he got tripped
up by ``a memory test'' in his Feb. 2 grand jury appearance, and
has vowed to prove he did not intend to deceive.
   The trial comes in the final stages of a bitter election
campaign between Swindall and Democrat Ben Jones, who played Cooter
on the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' television show.
   A poll conducted by The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution last week found Jones leading Swindall 53 percent to
27 percent, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
   Swindall was indicted just a week ago. He demanded a swift trial
in an effort to clear his name before the Nov. 8 election.
   Swindall is accused of concealing knowledge that something
illegal was being planned by LeChasney and ``Martinez.'' The
indictment says that when the congressman was asked why he did not
take his admitted suspicions to authorities, he replied:
   ``Because I never satisfied myself of anything with respect to
criminality, other than I did not feel comfortable that the deal
was a right deal. I did not want to get in the posture of, if I
could avoid it, putting myself in the position of pointing my
finger at what could be a drug person, who could very well
jeopardize myself and my family. I frankly hoped that he was
legitimate.''
   The transcript of the government's tape recording of a Sept. 13,
1987 meeting says the undercover agent told Swindall, ``All I can
tell you is that my gut feeling is there are narcotics dollars in
there. That's it.''
   ``I don't recall any conversation like that. ... I don't
remember ever the term narcotic used,'' Swindall told the grand
jury. But he said he smelled trouble ``and I walked away from it,
basically.''
   Twelve days after that meeting, Swindall accepted a $150,000
check from LeChasney. The prosecution claims Swindall was lying
when he said the check was not part of his negotiations with the
undercover agent.

<TEXT>
   While the eyes of the world focused on
the effort to free two gray whales stranded in ice near Barrow,
rescuers helped save 27 beluga whales that spent more than seven
hours trapped in mud near Anchorage.
   The whale pod apparently midjudged the tide and beached itself
at about 10 a.m. Sunday on a mud bar about halfway betwen Girdwood
and Portage along the Seward Highway, south of Anchorage.
   Dozens of people jammed the roadside to watch the silver-white
whales gently flopping on the mud, steam rising from their
blowholes. The whales ranged in size from about 6-feet-long to
16-feet-long.
   Kayakers Jim Diehl and Riley Cronk braved the treacherous
mudflats and swirling currents to spend more than an hour with the
whales, pouring water on them and wrapping them in wet tarps and
blankets until they could swim free.
   ``They were all alive. They looked all wrinkly when we first got
there and when we left they weren't wrinkly any more,'' Diehl said.
   A helicopter ferried veterinarian Tex Cody and National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration biologists to the stranded animals,
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement agents also
visited them.
   ``We went in and checked all the animals, bathed their eyes and
kept them wet,'' said Roger Mercer, a NOAA biologist. The men threw
another dozen wet blankets over the whales and waited for the tide.
   The tide came in at about 5:35 p.m. ``It was really kind of
exciting,'' Mercer said. ``As soon as the tidal water hit them,
they started flopping around and then kicking.''
   The helicopter hovered nearby as the whales swam to freedom.

<TEXT>
   A gun battle sent hundreds of people dashing for
cover at the Texas State Fair and ended with one man dead and three
wounded, but officials declared the 1988 fair a success and said
overall crime was down.
   ``Despite that isolated incident Friday, the officers on the
detail this year worked extremely hard to make this a safe fair,''
said Dallas police deputy Chief R.L. Schifelbein.
   Several fights broke out late Friday and Schifelbein, who
oversees fair security, decided to begin closing things down for
the night. Police had taken a pistol from a 14-year-old boy who
pulled it from a pocket during a scuffle with several youths.
Within a few hours officers had seized pistols from three other
people.
   ``Lord only knows what we didn't get,'' Schifelbein said. ``It
was obvious there were groups who came out here for the express
purpose of creating problems.''
   Then came the battle in which 18-year-old Bobby Joe Nabors Jr.
died of multiple gunshot wounds after he shot three other men,
police said.
   The first officer on the scene, Sgt. Manuel Vasquez, said he saw
Nabors shoot Joey Henry and tried to wrest the gun away. Vasquez
was shot in the hand during that struggle. Henry and another man
were in serious condition at Parkland Memorial Hospital.
   Off-duty police Cpl. James T. Daily, 38, who was working
security at the midway, saw Henry lying on the ground and Nabors
and Vasquez struggling. Police said Nabors pointed his pistol
toward Daily and Daily fired at him. Daily told investigators he
believed Nabors fired back, and the officer shot at Nabors again.
   However, police said Nabors was shot three times in the chest
and once in each arm. Investigators said the five wounds may have
been caused by fewer than five bullets, but police were unsure
whose gun fired the bullets that killed Nabors and aren't assuming
that only one person fired at Nabors.
   Eight pregnant women and several bystanders also were injured
when surrounding crowds pushed and shoved in a scramble to reach
shelter.
   In addition to the shooting, at least four people were slightly
injured Saturday when a Ferris wheel malfunctioned, jolting back
and forth several times and swaying uncontrollably, The Dallas
Morning News reported.
   Fair communication director Nancy Wiley said 2.9 million people
visited this year's 17-day fair, which ended Sunday night.
Attendance was up from 2.76 million in 1987, she said.
   Schifelbein said preliminary figures indicated 112 criminal
offenses were committed at this year's fair. That compares to 146
criminal offenses last year, he said.

   Heavy rain caused a flash flood today
as about 200 tourists trekked along the Samaria Gorge, and one man
was killed and five people were reported missing, police said.
   Some hikers sought refuge in a cave and others scrambled into
clefts in the rocky walls of the 11-mile long gorge as the water
rushed through, a police officer said.
   ``The rain has knocked out the phone to the village there so we
don't know exactly what happened. It seems there was a sudden flood
in a narrow part of the gorge,'' said the officer, who requested
anonymity in accordance with Greek practice.
   He said the body of a man in his 30s had been recovered but not
yet identified.
   Tourism Minister Nikos Skoulas was flying to Crete to supervise
rescue efforts.
   The Samaria Gorge, the longest in Europe, descends from an
upland plain to the southern coast of Crete. Its cliffs rise more
than 100 feet high and it narrows to around 10 feet wide at some
points. It is a popular hiking route in southern Crete.

<HEAD>NY Man Arrested In Drug Raid Must Pay Tax on $143,912 Confiscated
in Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man arrested during a drug raid on his home
must pay tax on $143,912 confiscated in the raid _ even though the
money immediately became government property, the U.S. Tax Court
says.
   Filippo Gambina of Middle Village, N.Y., contended that the cash
never came into his possession or control and, thus, that he had no
obligation to report it as taxable income.
   The court, in a decision made public today, said nothing in the
1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act ``indicates that Congress
intended that a taxpayer whose property is forfeited should be
relieved of the income tax consequences that would have attached
without said forfeiture.''
   ``Indeed, that history clearly reveals that ... Congress
intended to maximize the financial benefit of forfeiture to the
United States as against third parties who, prior to the
forfeiture, had acquired the fruits of the taxpayer's criminal
activities other than in a bona fide transaction,'' the court said.
   Freeing a person from having to report such money would have the
same effect as allowing a deduction for the amount _ ``a deduction
which has been denied on the ground that it would frustrate public
policy,'' the court added.
   This is the first time the Tax Court has reached such a
conclusion, although the U.S. District Court in eastern Louisiana
made a similar ruling in another case last March.

<TEXT>
   Two brothers suspected of robbery
and kidnapping a woman in Illinois have been arrested after a car
and helicopter chase at speeds up to 120 mph in which a police
officer was shot, police say.
   The abducted woman said her captors took her as far as Memphis,
Tenn., where they put her on a bus back home.
   Kenneth Gravatt, 23, and his brother, Michael, 19, both of
Marion, Ill., were arrested early Sunday and charged with
aggravated assault, possession of a firearm in the commission of a
felony and possession of a stolen car, said Cathy Baio, a
spokeswoman for the Broward County Sheriff's Department.
   Ms. Baio said police started chasing the Gravatts late Saturday
in Clewiston, Fla., after a deputy tried to stop them because they
looked suspicious.
   The pair fired dozens of shots at their pursuers and wounded a
Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy, police said.
   The 90-mile chase ended about an hour after it began when a
trooper shot out a tire and the Gravetts crashed on U.S. 27 west of
Hollywood.
   ``I'd say that's as far as we ever chased anybody,'' said Lt.
Bill Chamness of the Hendry County Sheriff's Office.
   Ten patrol cars and two helicopters had joined in the chase by
the time it ended, officers said.
   Other Florida charges, including the shooting of a Palm Beach
County sheriff's deputy, were pending, she said. The officer was
not seriously hurt.
   The Gravatts have been charged in Illinois with aggravated
kidnapping, burglary and armed robbery. A third suspect charged in
the abduction and robbery, Joseph Johnson, 19, also of Marion, was
not with the Gravatts and was still at large, said Williamson
County Deputy Sheriff Robert McCurdy.
   The kidnapping victim, Michelle Sisk, 28, of Creal Springs,
Ill., a mother of three, was forced into her car by a gunmen last
week after she paid for gasoline, police said.
   Her captors then drove on a route that included Princeton, Ind.,
Louisville, Ky. and Memphis, where they bought her a bus ticket,
said Sheriff Harry Spiller of Williamson County, Ill.
   On Thursday, three days after she was abducted, Mrs. Sisk's
captors bought her a bus ticket in Memphis and let her go. She told
authorities they planned to kill police if they were stopped and
had vowed not to be taken alive, Spiller said.
   The three are suspected of burglarized two homes shortly before
the abduction, stealing 22 rifles and shotguns, he said.

   Relations further deteriorated when President Mobutu Sese Seko

<TEXT>
   A report by an inquiry commission
today blamed pilot error for the fiery collision of three Italian
jets that killed 69 people at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base.
   The three Italian stunt jets collided during an air show Aug.
28, and one of the jets plunged into the crowd and exploded in
flames. All three pilots were among the dead.
   The collision occurred as the pilot referred to in the report as
the ``solo'' pilot was trying to fly through a heart-shaped
formation made by the other two planes.
   ``The cause of the mid-air collision between the solo pilot and
two other planes from the Italian stunt flying team Frecce
Tricolori has been determined to have been human error by the solo
pilot,'' the report said.
   The report issued by the West German Defense Ministry said other
possible causes of the disaster, such as technical failure or
collision with a flock of birds, could be ruled out.
   ``The commission has determined that there was no violation of
safety regulations for air shows that are binding for NATO member
states,'' the report said. ``The organizer had fulfilled
corresponding safety requirements and in part had even increased
them.''
   However, the report recommended that North Atlantic Treaty
Organization member states make a ``critical reassessment of air
shows in light if this tragic accident.''
   The commission included American, Italian and West German
experts and was led by the West German military flight safety
authority.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government declared a state
of emergency and evacuated residents from flood-prone coastal areas
in the path of a tropical storm that re-energized in the Pacific
today after killing 111 people as an Atlantic hurricane.
   In Nicaragua, the storm killed at least 50 people and left
300,000 homeless as it crossed the Central American isthmus, its
125 mph winds weakening to tropical storm status along the way.
   But the storm gained strength over the warm waters of the
Pacific. Forecasters gave what had been Joan a new name, Miriam,
and said it could become the first Atlantic hurricane to gain the
same status in the Pacific.
   ``We are ready for it,'' declared Interior Minister Edgardo
Belloso Funes as rains began falling in southeastern El Salvador.
He said a hurricane last struck El Salvador in 1934.
   At 11 a.m. EDT, Miriam's center was just off the coast about 75
miles south of Guatemala City and just southeast of San Jose,
Guatemala, with maximum sustained winds near 55 mph, said the
National Weather Service in Miami.
   It said the storm was centered at latitude 13.5 north, longitude
90.5 west and was nearly stationary this morning. The storm was
expected to begin moving slowly west-northwest within 24 hours.
   Tropical storm warnings covered the Pacific coast of El Salvador
and Guatemala. Flash flood and mud slide warnings also were in
effect in both countries.
   ``As soon as it got over the water offshore, it started to
strengthen again,'' said weather service forecaster Randy Lascody
in Miami.
   Officials closed the international airport in El Salvador on
Sunday and ordered all oceangoing vessels to remain in port.
   Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova, the defense minister, said residents
of flood-prone coastal areas in the eastern provinces of La Union,
San Miguel and Usulatan were being moved inland. Armed forces units
were on alert to assist the evacuations, he said.
   Heavy rains fell in southwestern Honduras along the Gulf of
Fonseca Sunday morning before tapering off, weather officials there
said. The government reported no flooding or evacuations.
   The Honduran Red Cross said one fisherman was reported missing
in the gulf, which is shared by El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.
   Hurricane Joan left 21 dead in Costa Rica, four in Panama, 25 in
Colombia, and 11 in Venezuela on its six-day rampage along the
Caribbean coast and then across Nicaragua to the Pacific Ocean.
   In Nicaragua, authorities labored to restore communications and
care for the homeless. The Sandinista government said it would make
a full evaluation of the destruction today and appealed for
international aid.
   Cuban planes carrying doctors and the first shipments of food
and medicine arrived in Managua and the devastated Caribbean port
of Bluefields on Sunday.
   Bluefields' mayor, Henningston Omeir, appealed for urgent aid
while in London Sunday, saying the economy was already in trouble
before the storm.
   Nicaraguan officials said 21 died in and around Bluefields, 180
miles east of Managua. The city of about 38,000 was 90 percent
destroyed when Joan struck early Saturday.
   The storm felled trees, electrical towers and telephone lines as
it ripped into Managua, the Nicaraguan capital. Many people living
in riverbeds near Managua lost their homes.
   President Daniel Ortega, asked whether the United States should
send aid, replied, ``The best humanitarian aid the United States
could give us would be to stop its terrorist policies against
Nicaragua.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States had not received any request for aid and did not
expect one, although it has provided weather information. He said
any request for aid would be considered, but added, ``It seems
clear he (Ortega) wants to use this storm as another platform for
propaganda against the Contras.''
   Citing its civil war with U.S.-supported rebels, the Sandinistas
recently enacted a law banning aid from the United States, but one
official said the law would be waived for badly hit areas.
   In Costa Rica, authorities said the storm destroyed 1,500 homes,
severely damaged six hospitals and health centers forced the
evacuation of 55,000 people. Schools and universities were to
remain closed today.
   Panamanian officials said 2,000 were left homeless and the
Pan-American Highway remained closed in Panama for a third day
Sunday because of mud slides.
   In an eight-day rampage across the Caribbean and Mexico that
began Sept. 10, a hurricane dubbed Gilbert killed more than 300
people, left hundreds of thousands homeless and caused billions of
dollars in damage. Jamaica was hit the hardest.

<TEXT>
   The government will publish some
of Franz Kafka's works and correspondence, a cultural weekly said.
   The magazine Kmen, organ of the official Union of Czech Writers,
said part of Kafka's correspondence was purchased from a
second-hand bookshop in Prague two years ago.
   Among the stories to be published are his last completed novel
``The Castle,'' published in 1926, and ``Amerika,'' which came out
in 1927, the magazine said.
   Kafka's works are highly acclaimed in the West but have been
barely acknowledged in Prague, where he was born in 1883.
   Rejected for what was described as ``morbid pessimism'' and
``alienation,'' the communists allowed both the 100th anniverasry
of Kafka's birth and the 60th anniversary of his death to pass with
little fanfare in the 1980s.
   The intellectual flowering of the mid-1960s led to the
construction of Prague's only public memorial to Kafka near the
street where he lived.
   Kmen described Kafka as an integral part of Prague literary
scene. ``Today's remembrance of Kafka is not an act of piety or
strategy but a fact of a simple refreshment of cultural memory,''
it said.

   A man was killed when a beer keg placed on a
bonfire exploded and a piece of metal severed his spinal cord,
authorities said.
   Patrick Viola, 22, of Niskayuna died early Saturday at an
outdoor beer party, police said. He had been standing about five
feet from the fire.
   About one quart of beer remained in the bottom of the keg when
it was placed on the fire, and the liquid began to boil, causing
steam and pressure to build up until the keg exploded.
   An autopsy determined that Viola was killed instantly when a
piece of the keg entered the right side of his neck, said Albany
County Coroner Timothy Cavanaugh.
   None of the other people at the party in the wooded area were
injured, said Lt. Raymond Krolak of the Town of Colonie Police.

<HEAD>Pope Tells U.S. Bishops to Fight Abortion, Contraception</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II urged U.S. bishops Monday
to persuade couples to embrace marriage and reject abortion and
contraception, lamenting a world ``that often reduces sex to the
pursuit of pleasure.''
   In a speech to 18 visiting bishops from Michigan and Ohio, the
pope said he wanted to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Pope
Paul VI's encyclical Humanae Vita, which reaffirmed the church's
ban on artificial birth control.
   ``We see ever more clearly today how relevant and positive it
is,'' the pontiff told the delegation headed by Cardinal Edmund
Szoka of Detroit.
   The pope, speaking in English, said the bishops should increase
efforts to spread the church's teaching on marriage and family
issues, ``especially the sexual dimension.''
   ``In a world that often reduces sex to the pursuit of pleasure,
and in some cases to domination, the church has a special mission
to place sex in the context of conjugal love and of generous and
responsible openness to parenthood,'' John Paul said.
   ``As pastors we must encourage couples to maintain an openness
to life and a spirit of joyful sharing in regard to children,'' he
said. ``Children are really the supreme gift of marriage ... but
materialistic and selfish attitudes often deny the value of the
child.''
   The pope said he ``deeply appreciated'' the efforts of the U.S.
Bishops' Conference to defend the church position that life starts
with conception.
   ``Throughout the world we have seen an increase in the number of
abortions and a decline in the protection of unborn human life,''
he said. ``The bishops of the United States have steadfastly
opposed this destruction of human life by programs of education and
pastoral care and by advocating laws and public policies that
protect and sustain human life, before and after birth.''
   Referring again to abortion and birth control, the pope said:
   ``We must emphasize the sanctity of human life as a precious
gift from God that needs to be protected and fostered, while making
more systematic efforts to offer instruction in the natural methods
of family planning.
   ``Natural family planning enables couples to understand God's
design for sex, and invites them to dialogue, mutual respect,
shared responsibility and self-control.''
   John Paul also reminded the bishops of the importance of
priestly celibacy, describing it as a ``gift from God.''
   ``The rule of celibacy for the Latin Church is more than
ecclesiastical law,'' he said. ``It has deep theological and
doctrinal roots.''

<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A steel-lined boxcar loaded with low-level
nuclear waste from Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant returned to
the plant today after being ordered out of Idaho over the weekend.
   But Colorado Gov. Roy Romer has urged that the boxcar remain on
railroad tracks and its cargo of rags, clothing and equipment
contaminated by plutonium residue be kept aboard until another
storage site can be found elsewhere.
   Ed Heintz, director of communications for Rockwell International
which operates Rocky Flats for the Department of Energy, said the
boxcar will remain on a siding until officials can decide where to
send the waste.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil D. Andrus on Saturday turned the unwanted
boxcar back from a temporary storage site at Idaho Falls, and
banned further shipments to his state. Before then, it had spent
several days in limbo at a railyard in Blackfoot, Idaho.
   Romer on Sunday then rejected a Department of Energy request to
expand low-level radioactive waste storage at Rocky Flats.
   ``I'm not going to authorize an enlargement of that storage, the
reason being I do not want Colorado to be the escape valve for
everybody's failure to provide a permanent site,'' Romer said.
   DOE had planned to transfer the waste from the Idaho site to New
Mexico when the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant permanent disposal site
there opens. The WIPP facility was scheduled to be open this month,
but the date has been pushed back at least until early next year.
   If the WIPP site opens in January as the DOE now plans, Rocky
Flats wastes will account for more than 70 percent of the debris to
be buried in salt deposits 2,500 feet underground.
   ``I met with DOE and they said, `Would you expand the
authorization to store (at Rocky Flats)?' And my answer was `No!,'
'' Romer told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   ``I said, `You can keep the authorization for storage you now
have. But I will not enlarge the storage.' There is an interim
arrangement which provides for about 1,600 cubic yards of material
... I said, `You can bring the railcar back. But the capacity that
the railcar takes has to be a part of the original interim
agreement,''' Romer said.
   ``I also asked them not to unload that car but to leave it
loaded and to leave it on the track so we can work to find another
destination for it,'' Romer said.
   Romer said he hoped to confer with other governors in the region
on finding a way to get the New Mexico site open as soon as
possible.
   Romer said about 650 yards of low-level waste has been stored at
Rocky Flats, leaving about 950 cubic yards to go until its storage
limit is reached.

   In baseball, ``It's not over till it's over,''
and in basketball someone once appropriated an operatic metaphor,
``It ain't over till the fat lady sings.'' But in presidential
politics perhaps it is best put by Tom Cole of the Oklahoma
Republican Party: ``I don't think anyone who is outregistered 2-1
can take anything for granted.''
   And so it stands, two weeks before Election Day.
   George Bush is ahead, but uneasy lies the crown.
   Michael Dukakis picked up an underdog's second wind last week,
answering weeks of spectacular Bush advertising with some creative
counterattacks of his own, and stumping the industrial Midwest with
a fervent critique of Republican economics.
   ``George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street,'' Dukakis
told a crowd last week in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``I care about the
people on Main Street. He's on their side. I'm on your side.''
   ``The corpse winked this week in Michigan,'' wrote a columnist
for the Detroit Free Press even as Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., was
euphorically forecasting ``a Bush Republican landslide.''
   In Kansas, Democratic Chairman Jim Parrish said: ``I hope the
Republicans think it's over. They could be in for the shock of
their lives. This race will not end until Nov. 8.''
   Of course many people think it ended Oct. 13, the night of the
second and final presidential debate. Conventional wisdom said
Dukakis needed a breakthrough to regain his footing in the
presidential race. There was none.
   In the 10 days since, Dukakis has unveiled a strongly worded
message of economic populism. Democrats are glad to see him on the
attack, but Dukakis doesn't always seem comfortable there himself.
   He slid into a booth beside Tim LaChina and his daughter last
Monday at Shorty's diner in Cleveland where LaChina implored,
``Let's kick some ass out there,'' to which Dukakis replied
somewhat less emphatically, ``OK, very good, we'll do it.''
   In recent days, the Republicans have been walking a fine line
between overconfidence in private and ``cautious optimism'' in
public.
   ``You don't want to be Goliath in these situations,'' quoth Bush
campaign manager Lee Atwater. ``The crowd is always cheering for
David.''
   Not everyone is finding it easy to adhere to discipline on this
_ GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was crowing Friday
night that the Democrats ``might end up on Election Night having a
one-state strategy, or maybe they'll just have a District of
Columbia strategy.''
   Perhaps Quayle should speak with the governor of Kansas before
writing David off.
   Kansas is a Republican state where Bush has suffered from the
vicissitudes of the farm economy and the criticisms of Senate GOP
Leader Bob Dole. ``There's one thing I know: you never take
anything for granted,'' Gov. Mike Hayden was saying last week.
``You never let up. It's ours to win, but it's also ours to lose.''
   With so many voters disenchanted with both candidates, Oklahoma
GOP chairman Cole had no particular difficulty fighting off the
urge to complacency.
   ``We have a good lead in Oklahoma,'' he said of Bush and Quayle.
``We were eight points down in August ... and now we are 10 points
ahead according to the same poll. That's not enough to say this
thing is over; at the same time in 1984 we had more than a 25
percent lead.''
   So Cole looks for something to worry about, and in common with
Republicans across much of the country, when he casts his eyes
across his political kingdom, he sees a lot of voters with the
habit of pulling Democratic levers. Four of Oklahoma's six
congressman are Democrats, along with more than two thirds of the
Legislature.
   Not that this tendency to vote Democratic extends itself to
presidential elections. On an electoral map where Republican
victories are painted in stripes, you have to go back to the LBJ
landslide of 1964 to find Oklahoma in a Democratic shade.
   This of course is one of the mysteries of the universe, on a par
with Yasser Arafat's permanent stubble and flat-screen TV: How is
it that the Democrats can control the nation's city halls, its
legislatures, its statehouses and both houses of Congress, and yet
since 1952 they have won the White House just three times in nine
tries?
   In Quayle's Indiana (six Democratic congressmen out of 10, but
truly one of the more Republican states in the country), GOP
chairman Gordon K. Durnil was worrying recently that a last-minute
event could yet produce a sudden turn in Dukakis' favor.
   ``It's never over until it happens,' he said.
   What, me Goliath?

   George Bush declared today ``there isn't any racism'' in his
ads, and he denied Democratic charges of Republican lying. Michael
Dukakis renewed the allegation of lying, saying the Republicans
can't win if they discuss the issues truthfully.
   With two weeks to go in the presidential election, Republican
Bush was campaigning in Connecticut and other Northeastern states
while Dukakis was seeking support in vote-rich California.
   Reacting to weekend talk of racism, Bush told reporters today.
``It's absolutely ridiculous and everybody sees this as some
desperation kind of move, basing it on one ad.''
   Bush was referring to Democratic complaints that the Republicans
have been appealing to racial fears in Bush's speeches and ads
stressing the case of Willie Horton Jr., a black convicted murderer
who raped a white woman after escaping from a Massachusetts prison
furlough.
   ``I mean people see this for what it is _ a campaign tactic. I
stand 100 percent behind those ads. I think the American people are
smart,'' Bush said.
   He added that the Democrats are running an ad about a man from a
Bush-supported Houston halfway house who murdered a minister's
wife. Bush asked, ``What about their ad about the halfway house? Is
that racism against Hispanics?''
   ``He is upset, not because it's false but because he is weak on
crime and defense. And that's the inescapable truth,'' Bush said at
a campaign breakfast in Waterbury, Conn.
   Dukakis, said at a rally in Los Angeles, ``You know, Mark Twain
once said that a lie can travel halfway around the world while the
truth is still putting on its shoes. Mr. Bush must have read Mark
Twain, because he's running a campaign based on distortions and
distractions _ and outright lies.
   ``Why? Because he can't win an election where the real issues
are discussed; the real challenges are faced; and the real
differences are made known.''
   Dukakis renewed his criticism of Bush's proposal for a capital
gains tax credit, which Dukakis said would give Bush himself an
annual tax break of $22,000.
   ``George Bush wants to give people like George Bush a tax break
that's more than the average California worker makes in a year,''
Dukakis said.
   Bush, on the other hand, said in a speech prepared for delivery
to a business group in Waterbury, ``My opponent now wants to turn
back to clog up the circulatory system of America's economy with
exactly the kind of big government schemes the Europeans are
discarding.''
   Dukakis was spending the entire day in California, including
stops in Los Angeles and San Francisco, in pursuit of that crucial
state's 47 electoral votes.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was going to
be accompanied by his mother, Corrine Quayle, during his first stop
in Missouri. He was going on to Kentucky.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen was
campaigning in Michigan, Missouri and Arkansas.
   Dukakis, stopping Sunday night in Eau Claire, Wis., attacked the
Republican ticket for what he called its ``steady stream of
distortion and misrepresentation.''
   Although Dukakis didn't mention it, campaign vice-chairman John
Sasso said the candidate agreed with assertions by Bentsen and
black leader Jesse Jackson that there were racist overtones to some
Bush tactics.
   Bentsen told a television interviewer he thought the Bush
campaign was making a racist appeal by focusing on Willie Horton
Jr., a black convicted murderer who escaped in 1986 from a
Massachusetts prison furlough.
   In 1987, Horton stabbed a white Maryland man and raped the man's
fiancee. Horton is currently imprisoned in Maryland.
   Asked on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' if use of
the Horton case constituted ``an element of Republican racist
appeal,'' Bentsen replied: ``When you add it up, I think there is,
and that's unfortunate, and I just don't want to see this election
won on that kind of packaging and that kind of distortions.''
   In Boston, Jackson avoided the word ``racist'' but said the
Horton case was one of several ``rather ugly race-conscious
signals'' sent out by the Bush campaign.
   ``There have been a number of rather blatantly race-conscious
signals that have had the impact of instilling ungrounded fear in
whites and alienation from blacks,'' Jackson said after a 90-minute
breakfast he and other black political leaders had with Dukakis.
   Dukakis' meeting with the black leaders was the first such
gathering since the Democratic convention, said Dukakis spokesman
Mark Gearan. A session with Hispanic leaders was planned for
Wednesday.
   Jackson emerged from the meeting pledging to work harder for
Dukakis, and on Sunday night in Atlanta, he delivered a speech
calling Bush ``one who runs against civil liberties, civil rights,
women's rights, the poor and the homeless.''
   In other developments, a new poll conducted for the Dallas
Morning News and the Houston Chronicle showed the Bush-Quayle
ticket led the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket among likely Texas voters by
52 percent to 42 percent.
   The survey of 776 potential voters conducted between Oct. 17 and
Oct. 20 had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage
points.
   A poll by the Milwaukee Sentinel showed support for Dukakis
slipping in Wisconsin. He was backed by 47 percent of the likely
voters, compared with 45 percent for Bush. Dukakis had led 50-39 in
August.
   The telephone survey Oct. 14-18 of 687 likely voters had a
four-point margin of error in either direction.
   Nebraska's largest newspaper, The Omaha World-Herald, today
endorsed Bush over Dukakis. The editorial cited Bush's experience
as well as his stands on the issues.

   A ``ticket to easy street'' prompted a
woman to help plan the kidnapping of businessman Stephen Small, who
was buried alive in a bid for a $1 million ransom, a prosecutor
said today.
   Small suffocated when a breathing device failed in the wooden
box in which he was buried after his abduction in September 1987.
   Nancy Rish is the second person to face murder and kidnapping
charges in the case.
   Daniel Edwards, who shared a home with Rish, was convicted in
May of kidnapping and murdering Small and was sentenced to death.
   Small's death was the result of a ``cold, callous, calculating
plan of Nancy Rish and Danny Edwards for the big score _ the $1
million jackpot,'' prosecutor Michael Ficaro told the jury in
opening statements.
   His life ``was what they were willing to do for $1 million ...
that ticket to easy street ... life in the fast lane,'' Ficaro said.
   Rish's attorney, Vincent Paulauskis, has said he was looking
forward to the trial ``to let the public know the whole story.''
   ``Up to this point,'' he said, ``the public has only been told
what other people have said, what Danny Edwards has said, and what
Danny Edwards has done. That's going to change October 24th.''
   Small, 40, was the great-grandson of a former Illinois governor
and son of the late Burrell L. Small, who controlled a group of
radio and television stations.
   The jury for Rish's trial was selected in Rockford because of
the extensive news coverage of the crime in the Kankakee area. The
jurors will be sequestered during the trial.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a three-term
Senate maverick who regularly enrages fellow Republicans with his
independence, once seemed an easy bet for re-election in
Connecticut but he's suddenly running scared.
   His opponent is Joseph I. Lieberman, the state's popular
Democratic attorney general for the past six years, a lawyer and
the son of a Stamford liquor store owner.
   Lieberman is a lackluster campaigner who missed his own
nomination for the Senate last summer because the party convention
was held on Saturday while he was observing the Sabbath as an
Orthodox Jew.
   But Lieberman also was the Democrats' top statewide vote-getter
in 1982 and ranked second in 1986. A self-styled ``people's
lawyer,'' he churns out reams of press releases about his campaigns
against polluters, grocery chains and unscrupulous auto dealers.
   He is the best-financed challenger that Weicker has ever faced.
And Weicker, who has never lost an election, is fighting the
toughest battle of his political life, which began with his
election to the state House of Representatives 26 years ago.
   A Connecticut poll published last week by The Hartford Courant,
showed that Lieberman, who once trailed Weicker by 24 points, had
surged to a 39-39 tie with 22 percent undecided.
   Weicker said the poll was an aberration, and that other
independent surveys conducted shortly beforehand showed him leading
by 10 points or more. Lieberman said the latest poll confirmed his
contentions that victory in the Nov. 8 election is within his grasp.
   As if Weicker's troubles weren't enough, the conservative
Buckley family is nipping at his heels.
   A family ``BuckPac,'' the fund-raising arm of ``Buckleys for
Lieberman,'' reported raising $3,737.50 to be spent mostly on local
newspaper ads attacking Weicker as a far-out liberal who should
forsake the Republican label.
   Marla Romash of the Lieberman campaign said National Review
editor William F. Buckley Jr. helped raise money for the Democratic
candidate ``not because he likes Joe Lieberman but because he hates
Lowell Weicker.''
   Snorted Weicker: ``They care about their ultra-conservative
principles, be damned with the party.''
   Weicker is known for his frequent bashing of President Reagan
and other fellow Republicans, especially President Nixon for his
Watergate misdeeds. He opposes the balanced budget amendment to the
Constitution favored by many Republicans, and condemned Reagan's
military actions against Libya and Grenada.
   In a state where Democrats hold a 3-to-2 edge over Republicans,
Weicker owes his unbroken string of election successes to his
appeal among Connecticut's 550,000 unaffiliated voters.
   He also has won support among traditionally Democratic groups.
His endorsements this year by the Connecticut state AFL-CIO and
Connecticut Freeze Voter, a nuclear arms freeze organization, were
shrugged off by Lieberman as the sort that any incumbent senator
might get.
   As Lieberman has narrowed the gap, the campaign has become
increasingly shrill.
   Lieberman is running television commercials depicting Weicker as
a bear who sleeps through important Senate votes.
   Lieberman claims Weicker's 90 percent attendance record is among
the worst in the Senate, where he has served since 1970. Weicker
says 90 percent ``is an A in anybody's book.''
   At week's end, Weicker raised questions about Lieberman's
attendance record during his 10 years in the state Senate before he
became attorney general.
   Weicker also began airing a TV ad featuring Lieberman singing
Weicker's praises at a 1986 testimonial. The spot ends with the
announcer saying, ``If Lieberman believes what he says, he'll vote
for Weicker.''
   The two men have already set a spending record for a Connecticut
Senate campaign. Lieberman has raised about $1.8 million to
Weicker's $2.2 million, according to financial reports issued this
month. They're expected to spend another $1 million between them
before the election is over.

   Republicans and Democrats agree that the 100th
Congress compiled a formidable record of achievement, but the
legislators also left behind a list of unsolved issues ranging from
the minimum wage to cleaning up the country's air and helping
families.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday, ``from our
point of view, the 100th Congress has been very productive and we
are extraordinarily pleased that so many parts of the president's
agenda have been enacted into law.''
   Fitzwater said Congress, which adjourned early Saturday, left
about 120 bills on Reagan's desk. The president will veto some and
sign the others, Fitzwater said, but the spokesman did not know
which ones would be rejected.
   Shortly before Congress adjourned, Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues the Democratic-controlled 100th
Congress had a record ``of decisive action. We have produced
results across the board.''
   But Byrd added that ``even so, much remains to be tackled, and
our time is about to expire. The 101st Congress has some formidable
challenges to address.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., agreed. ``I think it
was quite successful, overall, but there were also some things we
didn't get that we would have liked.''
   A number of the unresolved issues involve domestic policy
fights, such as the minimum wage, family-related legislation and
cleaning up the nation's air.
   Since 1981, the minimum wage has been $3.35 per hour, but
Democrats in recent months pushed for an increase. It was a drive
they hoped to turn into political gains during the election
campaign.
   Democrats succeeded in bringing to the Senate floor a bill that
would have raised the minimum wage to $4.55 per hour over a
three-year period, but Republicans said they would filibuster
unless the Judiciary Committee voted to approve 25 of President
Reagan's judicial appointments.
   The Senate tried to cut off debate, but that move only picked up
56 votes, four short of the 60 needed. That moved minimum wage
legislation to the back burner.
   A look at some of the other unfinished business:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CLEAN AIR _ The Senate considered a bill which would have tried
to control acid rain by restricting smokestack emissions, along
with tightening auto-emission standards and restricting the burning
of toxic chemicals. But there was strong opposition in both the
House and Senate, particularly from legislators representing states
producing low-sulfur coal such as those in the Rocky Mountain area.
   CHILD CARE _ The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
voted approval in July of a bill providing $2.5 billion for child
care, with 75 percent of that amount ticketed for low- and
moderate-income families. But opposition by a variety of groups,
including the National Education Association and the National
Parent Teachers Association, stalled floor action. They were
opposed because some of the money would go to child-care centers
sponsored by religious institutions.
   PARENTAL LEAVE _ Democrats backed a proposal to require
employers of 50 or more people to give up to 10 weeks of unpaid
parental and medical leave. Senate Republicans attached an
amendment making child pornography a federal crime. Democrats tried
to strip that provision out of the bill, but failed.
   IMPEACHMENT _ The House voted 413-3 on Aug. 3 to impeach U.S.
District Court Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida for high crimes
and misdemeanors, alleging perjury and conspiracy to receive a
bribe. The Senate later decided to postpone the impeachment trial
until 1989.
   The House also delayed impeachment proceedings against U.S.
District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. of Mississippi. Nixon is serving
a five-year prison term for perjury.
   SOUTH AFRICA SANCTIONS _ On Aug. 11, the House voted 244-132
approval of a bill to prohibit almost all trade with white-ruled
South Africa. It also would have barred South African imports. The
Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved similar legislation,
but filibuster threats blocked any floor action.
   AIRLINE CONSUMER PROTECTION _ The House approved a bill
requiring airlines to disclose information on flight delays and
compensation for workers hurt by mergers. The Senate passed a
similar bill, but a House-Senate conference committee called to
resolve differeces broke down in fighting over provisions for the
random testing of transportation industry employees.
   CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM _ Senate Democrats backed a bill capping
the amount senators could receive from political action committees.
Republicans filibustered and there were eight unsuccessful votes
attempting to halt the filibuster. During one procedural fight over
the filibuster, arrest warrants were issued for missing senators
and Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., was brought forcibly to the Senate
floor.
   NUCLEAR TREATIES _ Still awaiting action are a pair of treaties
negotiated between the Soviet Union and United States more than a
decade ago. They would restrict nuclear explosions to no more than
150 kilotons. President Reagan had promised to push for
ratification if an improved method could be found to verify the
pacts.

<HEAD>White House Charges That Ortega Used Hurricane for Propaganda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House accused Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega on Monday of seizing upon the hurricane which
thrashed his nation over the weekend as a tool for propaganda
against the Reagan administration's support of the Contra rebels.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said no request for U.S. aid had been
received from the Nicaraguan government and none is expected,
although the United States has provided weather information. He
said the administration would consider any request it received.
   Hurricane Joan killed at least 50 people and left 300,000
homeless in Nicaragua before weakening to a tropical storm and
moving north to Honduras and El Salvador.
   In Managua, the Nicaraguan government appealed for international
aid as authorities labored to restore communications and care for
the homeless.
   Ortega, asked whether the United States should send aid,
replied, ``The best humanitarian aid the United States could give
us would be to stop its terrorist policies against Nicaragua.''
   Citing its civil war with the U.S.-supported rebels, the
Sandinistas recently enacted a law banning aid from the United
States, but one official said the law would be waived for badly hit
areas.
   ``At the moment we don't have a request,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
are providing weather information but the question of other kinds
of assistance hasn't come up.''
   Asked whether a request was expected, he said, ``I frankly think
it's very unlikely.''
   ``Our concern, frankly, is that the Ortega government would use
this as another opportunity to somehow deal adversely with the
Contras, so we do have serious problems,'' the spokesman said.
   ``It seems clear he (Ortega) wants to use this storm as another
platform for propaganda against the Contras,'' Fitzwater said.
   He quoted Ortega as saying that ``U.S. aid was harming the
country and the Contras were harming the country in its ability to
deal with the storm and those kinds of things.''
   He said the administration has made no judgment on the question
of aid, but added, ``I simply point out the politicization of this
by Daniel Ortega.''
   When asked about press restrictions imposed in Nicaragua in
connection with the storm, Fitzwater said, ``To do it at this time
under cover of a storm is really no worse really than the
performance he has displayed for the past six or seven years in
terms of closing down the press.''

   A University of Wisconsin fraternity is
under investigation for sponsoring a mock slave auction in which
pledges reportedly donned black faces and Afro wigs, school
officials said today.
   ``The format was that the pledges would put on skits and then
the pledges would be put on auction for the sale of their
services,'' said Roger Howard, Assistant Dean of Students.
   Members of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity could not be immediately
reached for comment on the incident, which occurred Thursday.
   However, the Interfraternity Council, a student body that
governs the university's fraternities, said some fraternity members
will be expelled and the fraternity will be suspended from
university activities because of the auction.
   ``Something needed to be done because what happened was horrible
and there's no place for that in the Greek system,'' IFC President
Andrew Bohman said.
   The council ordered the immediate expulsion of members involved
in the incident and suspended the fraternity from participating in
social and other events pending the outcome of investigations by
the university and the council, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Leaves Mark on U.S. Judiciary With Conservative
Appointments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee left its mark
on the judicial confirmation process in the 100th Congress, but
President Reagan left his stamp on the entire federal court system.
   When the clock ran out last week on two years of mostly partisan
disputes over judicial nominations, Reagan nominees were sitting in
more than half the full-time judge's chairs in the country _ 384 of
752.
   One who didn't make it was Robert H. Bork. His view that there
is no explicit constitutional right of privacy helped Democrats
deny him a Supreme Court seat in a furious ideological battle.
   Throughout the 100th Congress, Democrats controlling the Senate
Judiciary Committee sparred often with Reagan and congressional
Republicans.
   The GOP said the committee's majority party stalled Reagan's
nominees, especially near the end of the session, to keep qualified
conservatives off the courts.
   Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., called the
delays necessary, arguing that Democrats refused to rubber stamp
Reagan nominees as he contended Republicans did when they
controlled the panel from 1981-86.
   In considering Supreme Court nominees, Biden said, the committee
sent a powerful message that senators have the right to go beyond
traditional questions about a Supreme Court nominee's character.
   They can inquire, he said, about whether a nominee's views are
``philosophically appropriate for the times.''
   Despite all the rhetoric, Reagan did reasonably well in getting
his nominees confirmed as he fought for judges who would strictly
follow the intent of the framers of the Constitution. The Senate
approved 91 nominees in the 100th Congress out of 110 nominations,
according to Judiciary Committee statistics.
   The 19 nominees not confirmed compared with 17 in the
presidential year of 1980, when Democrats controlled the Senate and
the White House, and 16 in the presidential year of 1984 when
Republicans controlled the Senate and the White House.
   Even the failure to seat Bork, in a Senate 58-42 vote in October
1987, may turn into a triumph for Reagan. The justice eventually
confirmed for the Supreme Court seat, Anthony M. Kennedy, could
well give the president the conservative rulings he sought from
Bork.
   Patrick McGuigan, a conservative and senior scholar at the Free
Congress Center for Law and Democracy, had this to say about the
more conservative judiciary that Reagan will leave behind:
   ``The picture you get ... is that half are principled
conservatives, and the remaining range from so-so to outright
turkeys.''
   McGuigan, who believes judges should ``honor the Constitution
and legislative intent, not the liberal agenda,'' said that
one-quarter of the federal judiciary is now ``strict construction
conservatives opposed in every fiber of their being to judicial
lawmaking.''
   McGuigan said another quarter to a third of the judiciary is
generally conservative _ but can be swayed by ``clever lawyering.''
   ``The remainder are committed judicial activists, a number of
them very capable, highly intelligent and assertive,'' he said.
   Nan Aron, co-chairwoman of the Alliance For Justice, an
organization of public interest legal groups, said the Judiciary
Committee also left its mark by exercising ``more scrutiny'' than
when the panel was under GOP control.
   She said the long committee debate over Bork ``set in motion a
much larger public debate over the role of the courts.''
   ``In many people's minds, it established thresholds for
standards below which nominees wouldn't be confirmed. Nominees were
judged not only on their quality and integrity, but their judicial
philosophy, and what they think the role of the courts are,'' she
said.
   ``Since Reagan transformed the bench in an unprecedented
fashion, the committee will be very sensitive toward confirming
people with clearly defined political views or ideological views.''
   A former committee aide under the Democrats, American University
law professor Herman Schwartz, said Reagan's nominees already have
made their impact on the lives of Americans.
   ``It's very difficult for minorities or women to win affirmative
action cases when Reagan appointees control the court as they do in
many circuits now,'' he said.
   ``In the District of Columbia circuit, a lot of environmental
cases are being thrown out on grounds of standing.''
   Schwartz predicted that until the Supreme Court rules on major
abortion cases, Reagan appellate court nominees will generally
uphold ``many of the obstacles state and local governments throw
up'' to make abortions more difficult.
   Schwartz noted that two Reagan nominees on the District of
Columbia Circuit constituted the majority on an appellate panel
that ruled the independent counsel law violated the Constitution _
the Reagan administration's position.
   The Supreme Court reversed them 7-1, thus upholding the law that
allows a court-appointed counsel to investigate and prosecute top
government officials. Justice Kennedy did not participate.

<HEAD>Chanel Offers Beautiful Long Looks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Designer Karl Lagerfeld dropped hemlines
dramatically in Monday's Chanel ready-to-wear summer show that
offered a dashing Deauville line.
   Lagerfeld played with the nostalgic beach resort and old
favorite Chanel themes nicely, recalling the days when
``Mademoiselle'' herself was just starting out at the fashionable
seaside resort.
   In fact, some of the long cardigan knit outfits almost looked
like carbon copies of what Chanel wore herself.
   Between wide A-line pants and knife-pleated skirts nearly to the
ankle, Lagerfeld brought out a new modified jodphur shape. More
sporty than the full pants, these lean trousers still had dressy
touches like welt seaming and gold buttons up the calf.
   Not all was long in this beautiful group of clothes that some
thought were generally more successful than Lagerfeld's collection
under his own label. A couple of nice knee-baring piped suits and
shorter shirtwaists dressed up with rows of gold buttons looked
chic as well.
   In nautical shades of red, navy and lots of white, the jackets
were either very short or very long, sometimes with vest-like
fronts and little V-shaped lapels or sailor collars underlined with
the Chanel bow and camellias rather than a knotted scarf.
   His boxy short jackets in delicately striped tweed had a new
piping of braid with loops.
   In addition to this easy silhouette, Chanel offered outfits in a
tubular shape with pleats flaring out at the hem.
   For a sexier look, there were tightly fitted suits in rose and
pink or turquoise and sky blue piped-knit jackets with very short
lean skirts.
   He also brought out some neutral shades like sand, caramel and
lichen _ using the latter in long pleated culottes and skirts with
billowy organza blouses.
   Now the Chanel woman can even wear a Chanel swimsuit, a new
offering here. Modest, though not at all nostalgic, they came out
in navy lycra with small white polka dots, and were highlighted at
waist or shoulder with the Chanel bow and flower.
   The Chanel logo comes up on short playsuits, chiffon dusters,
turned-up cuffs on pants and jacket linings _ as well as on silk
crepe full evening skirts with multicolored sequin tops.
   Dressy looks for summer were held to a minimum, but all were
beautiful. Gold sequin designs on navy linen blazers with flowing
ivory silk crepe pants or skirts are a good option out of the
collection for an informal dinner party. The lovely pleated and
tucked black or navy chiffon dresses can't be faulted for safe but
excellent chic.
   The loveliest evening clothes were gossamer-light white chiffons
with appliqued flowers on the billowing skirts and pearl edging
around the fitted sleeveless bodices.
   Sonia Rykiel, the sweater queen, showed both long and short
looks. The newest sweater was a shortie pullover teamed with wide
pyjama pants or narrow skirts flared at the knee.
   Among her most remarkable looks were suspendered shorts with
widely striped shirts in a collection that had a more youthful
touch than usual. The evening shorts were flippant fun, too, cut
cool and full in filmy chiffon, with embroidered jackets to match.

   Grand Ole Opry star Johnny Russell is
running a tongue-in-cheek race for president, vowing to have yard
sales and parties at the White House if elected.
   ``We will do away with the deficit,'' pledged Russell, a
singer-humorist who wrote the song ``Act Naturally.''
   ``Each Friday we will have a yard sale in the Rose Garden. Get
rid of some of that old furniture, some of those old pictures of
those old presidents and hang some new snapshots,'' Russell said.
   As a peace initiative, he pledged to ``bring all the world
leaders together at the White House for a barbecue ....''
   Russell, also known for his hit song ``Red Necks, White Socks
and Blue Ribbon Beer,'' was nominated for president recently by a
standing-room-only crowd of more than 400 friends and country music
fans at a Nashville nightclub.

<TEXT>
   Soviet flotillas churned toward Barrow to
offer help for two trapped whales as rescuers tried to lure the
mammals to freedom, but biologists said they may have to airlift
the animals to open water.
   ``We're having a net built right now'' to carry them, David
Withrow of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle said Sunday.
   He emphasized that an airlift was the least preferred
alternative, to be used only if rescuers fail to coax the
California gray whales to open water though a series of freshly cut
air holes in the ice.
   A third whale, the smallest and the youngest of the mammals
trapped in moving ice more than two weeks ago before they could
migrate south, disappeared Friday and was presumed dead.
   A pontoon-mounted ice auger known as an Archimedes screw tractor
was delivered during the weekend by a huge Air Force C-5A cargo
plane and was reassembled Sunday.
   The device was to begin work today on the outside edge of an ice
pressure ridge that stands between the whales and freedom.
   ``That's the next big project for us,'' said NOAA biologist Ron
Morris, coordinator of the rescue.
   NOAA asked the Soviet Union for help, and America's Arctic
neighbor ordered the icebreakers Admiral Makarov and Vladimir
Arseniev to Barrow, said NOAA Rear Adm. Sigmund R. Petersen,
director of the Pacific Marine Center in Seattle.
   The ships were 140 nautical miles from the Barrow area, the
Soviet news agency Tass reported today.
   Another flotilla unloaded equipment for a Soviet station at the
North Pole before heading immediately for Alaska, Tass said. Tass
did not saw how many ships were in the second group.
   The icebreakers are expected to arrive Tuesday afternoon, Col.
Tom Carroll of the Alaska National Guard, which is taking part in
the rescue effort, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' today.
   In Washington today, State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said the Admiral Makarov could arrive as early as tonight.
   It was unclear what good the icebreakers could do in the shallow
water near the whales. The ships need 39 feet of water to operate,
Tass said, and the whales were trapped in water 12 to 25 feet deep.
   Even if the icebreakers cannot reach the whales, the ships could
help clear a path to open water about 200 miles away, Petersen said.
   As high-tech heavy equipment poured into this whaling village
during the weekend, Eskimos used chain saws and muscle to make the
most progress toward freeing the animals.
   ``We're marching out to the lead with Inupiat (Eskimo) power,''
said Morris. ``The whales are responding to the holes.''
   The breathing holes extend more than 1{ miles from where the
whales were first trapped.
   The Eskimos connected several holes, converting them into a
narrow pool 250 feet long to give the whales more room to rest.
They made a similar slot in the ice over a shoal about 5 feet deep.
The shoal apparently deterred the whales from moving farther toward
open water.
   The whales appeared to be in good health, although a patch of
skin torn off one animal's snout appeared to be worsening, said Jim
Harvey, Withrow's colleague.
   Biologists believe a bone infection may have contributed to the
death of the smallest whale, which had been named Bone.
   The surviving whales were named Crossbeak and Bonnet by
biologists. Eskimos have named the survivors Siku, or ice, and
Putu, or ice hole. The vanished whale was named Knik, or snowflake.
   Wind continued blowing from a more northerly direction Sunday,
threatening to close the lead in the ice that rescuers were trying
to move the whales to.
   The airlift will have to be considered if the pressure ridge
cannot be breached, biologists said.
   ``It's been done numerous times with killer whales and the
like,'' Harvey said as he and Withrow tried to accurately measure
the whales' lenghth.
   The whales were estimated at 27 to 35 feet long, the smaller a
yearling and the other 2 to 3 years old, Withrow said.
   ``Getting them in the net will be tricky,'' Withrow said.
   The icebreakers were dispatched under a 1976 cooperative
environmental agreement with the Soviets, NOAA spokesman Brian
Gorman said in Washington, D.C.
   NOAA provided satellite photographs of polar ice to the Soviets
to help them map a route to Barrow, the northernmost community in
the United States, Gorman said.

   Jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela is making ``steady progress'' as he recovers from
tuberculosis and has resumed his normal exercise routine, a doctor
said Monday.
   The 70-year-old leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement was taken from Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town to
nearby Tygerberg Hospital on Aug. 12 to be treated for TB. He was
moved to Cape Town's Constantiaberg Clinic on Aug. 31, where he
continues to recuperate.
   ``Since my last visit on Sept. 13, Mr. Mandela has shown steady
progress,'' said Dr. J.G. Strauss, superintendent of Tygerberg.
   ``His weight is back to normal and Mr. Mandela is once again
following his usual routine of physical exercise, relaxation and
intellectual activities to which he was used to prior to his
illness,'' Strauss said.
   Strauss did not elaborate and gave no indication of how long he
expected Mandela to remain in the clinic.
   Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   There has been widespread speculation in South Africa that
Mandela could be released in coming months.
   His extended stay at the private clinic is widely seen as an
interim measure while the government decides whether to free him or
send him back to prison.
   However, Mandela's wife, Winnie, said after meeting with her
husband on Oct. 15, ``All the rumors about his release are sheer
rumors.''
   Government officials are wary that his release could spark a new
outbreak of black militancy and unrest, but they also perceive that
freeing Mandela could ease international pressure on South Africa.
   President P.W. Botha, who says he is considering Mandela's
release, has said Mandela will be freed if he renounces violence.
Mandela has refused, saying he will do so only if apartheid is
dismantled and the ANC is legalized.

Bill of Rights'' that bans pre-employment drug testing and limits
police involvement in strikes.
   A representative of the business community says the
far-reaching, nine-item proposal is yet another attempt by Berkeley
politicians to ``grab some headlines'' by drafting policy that, if
approved, will end up in court.
   The City Council, which has attracted attention by passing
measures on everything from foreign affairs to commercial rent
control, established a nine-member Labor Commission three years
ago, in what one member calls ``an example of Berkeley's vision.''
Part of its mandate was the drafting of the Bill of Rights, which
will be the subject of a hearing before the council Tuesday.
   ``We want to set up a partnership of working people, the city
and business people, talking about how we can have a stable, driven
economy in Berkeley,'' said Mayor Loni Hancock.
   Although some of it is patterned after ordinances elsewhere,
like a prevailing wage provision for the construction industry that
resembles a measure in neighboring Oakland, much of the proposal is
classic Berkeley.
   One element would forbid the city to sign a contract with ``any
employer involved in an officially sanctioned management-labor
dispute or which appears on the AFL-CIO `Do Not Patronize List.'''
   The provision ``would be building on the tradition the city has,
rather than be something wild and radical, which it's not,''
according to Kathy Labriola, vice chairman of the commission.
   The city, with a popularist tradition rooted in the 1960s'
counterculture that flourished at its university, already has
formally endorsed the United Farm Workers' grape boycott. It
refuses to pay for city employees to travel to states that have not
endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment and boycotts products made in
South Africa as well as companies that do business in the racially
segregated country.
   Another provision of the Bill of Rights would instruct police to
remain neutral in labor disputes, preventing officers from
escorting strikebreakers across picket lines or ``attacking,
harassing or intimidating'' strikers.
   Employers would be required, ``when lawful and feasible,'' to
give 12 months notice of plant closures and to meet with city and
employee representatives to help avoid shutdowns.
   And the proposal would expand an informal city directive by
requiring, where possible, developers who build new non-residential
structures over 15,000 square feet to provide on-site child care
for workers or to pay into a city child-care fund.
   Other provisions would make it policy to promote full employment
for Berkeley residents, encourage local ownership of property and
businesses by residents and workers and foster union participation
in ``high quality'' job creation efforts.
   The statement endorses a proposal to help the city's
approximately 13,000 disabled residents find jobs and also urges
the school district to develop a labor-oriented curriculum.
   Commissioners have tried to insulate the bill from legal
challenges by sprinkling clauses like ``when lawful and feasible''
throughout.
   Jeff Casey, executive director of the Berkeley Chamber of
Commerce, said business people are ``just sort of turned off by the
whole process'' of working with the Labor Commission, which he
described as ``stacked with all union reps.''
   The chamber, which is working with the city's Office of Economic
Development to attract business, is not planning to fight the Bill
of Rights because Casey believes it would not be enforceable.
   ``If we really thought it would impact business or drive people
out of town,'' he said, ``we'd stand up and fight it.''

   A Supreme Court justice on Monday temporarily
shielded Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. from having to pay a $4 million
damage award to a Minnesota service station attendant injured by an
exploding tire.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor granted an emergency request by
Goodyear to extend a lower court order permitting the company to
withhold the money pending action by the full Supreme Court on a
formal Goodyear appeal.
   O'Connor issued the order at Georgetown University Hospital,
where she is recovering from surgery Friday for breast cancer.
   In the Goodyear case, the company was ordered to pay $3.37
million in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages
to Dale Hodder.
   Hodder, who worked at a service station in Remer, Minn., was 17
at the time of the accident on Dec. 19, 1981. The metal rim of a
truck tire exploded while he was mounting the tire on a customer's
logging truck.
   Goodyear is appealing to the Supreme Court to overturn the
punitive damages award, but the not the judgment for compensatory
damages.

   Republican nominee George Bush today
rejected Democratic charges that his campaign advertising is racist
in stressing the case of Willie Horton Jr., a black convicted
murderer who raped a white woman after escaping from a
Massachusetts prison furlough.
   The vice president responded to charges from Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and others as he flew to New England for a
day-long campaign tour aimed at making trouble for Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis in his own territory.
   ``There isn't any racism,'' Bush told reporters on Air Force
Two. ``It's absolutely ridiculous and everybody sees this as some
desperation kind of move, basing it on one ad.''
   The Democrats had accused the GOP nominee of inflaming racial
fears by emphasizing the Horton case, which has been a favorite
Bush theme in speeches and television commercials charging that
Dukakis is soft on crime.
   A Republican Party campaign flier mailed recently to several
hundred thousand New Yorkers featured a photograph of Horton, who
now is imprisoned in Maryland where the woman's rape and the
slashing of her fiance occurred.
   ``I stand fully behind these ads, and at the last minute _ those
ads have been on a long, long time _ for some concerted effort with
all these people going out saying the same thing, I mean people see
this for what it is _ a campaign tactic. I stand 100 percent behind
those ads. I think the American people are smart,'' Bush said.
   He tried to turn the attack against Dukakis by noting that the
Democrats are running an ad about a man from a halfway house in
Bush's hometown of Houston who murdered a minister's wife. Bush was
a supporter of the halfway house.
   ``What about their ad about the halfway house? Is that racism
against Hispanics?'' Bush asked.
   The racism charges were termed ``totally absurd'' by GOP vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle during a flight to Missouri. ``I
think it shows just how desperate they really are to start fanning
the fires of racism in this country,'' Quayle said.
   Later, at a rain-swept rally outside Portland City Hall in
Maine, Bush was heckled by several hundred Dukakis supporters who
chanted, `No More Lies.''
   ``I don't blame these people,'' Bush said. ``If I had a
candidate like that, who went around the United States telling
everybody how bad everything was, I'd try to yell a little bit,
too.''
   Arriving in Waterbury, Bush told an airport crowd that ``we are
not going to be deterred by the negative attacks coming out of the
other side.''
   In the closing days of the campaign, he said, ``I'm going to run
like I'm 10 points back all across this country.''
   The theme of the day was economics, and Bush lambasted Dukakis
in a speech prepared for delivery before a group of business
leaders.
   ``My opponent now wants to turn back to clog up the circulatory
system of America's economy with exactly the kind of big government
schemes the Europeans are discarding,'' the vice president said.
   ``Economists call the resulting economic paralysis
`Eurosclerosis.' I call it Dukakonomics. It rhymes with
Carternomics. It didn't work then, and it won't work now.''
   To Dukakis' complaint that GOP campaign ads are ``full of
lies,'' Bush retorted that the Massachusetts governor had lied
about his record. ``He is upset, not because it's false, but
because he is weak on crime and defense, and that's the inescapable
truth,'' Bush said.
   Going into the home stretch of the presidential race, Bush
headed for rallies today in Waterbury, Conn., Portland, Maine, and
Burlington, Vt., as he began a final, non-stop stretch of
campaigning that will take him to California and back to Washington.
   Press aide Mark Goodin said the trip marks the start of 15
straight days of campaigning with no more breaks until the Nov. 8
election.
   Confident that his political base in the Souh and Rocky Mountain
states is secure, Bush is trying to harass Dukakis in his region.
   None of the states on today's itinerary packs many of the
electoral votes needed to win the White House. Of the 270 needed
for victory, Connecticut offers only eight, Maine has four and
Vermont has three.
   However, Bush's strategists consider it a good investment of
time because it could weaken Dukakis on his home turf and force him
to devote time and resources in an area that should belong to him.
   With Dukakis trailing in the polls, ``he's got to fight a
multi-front war,'' said Goodin, the spokesman for Bush. ``He needs
every vote at this point.
   ``It's now a strategy of locking him out,'' said Goodin. ``We're
taking his base away from him.''
   Goodin said polls show Bush is ahead in Connecticut, Maine and
Vermont.
   Eyeing the most politically important state in the Northeast,
Goodin said Bush is down in New York four to six points but is
``extremely competitive'' in a state once regarded safe for Dukakis.
   Bush has spent only one day in New York and spent virtually no
money there, Goodin said.
   ``We may yet go in again ... if we can take it away or at least
make him fight for it,'' Goodin said.
   After today's trip, Bush will return to Washington for the
night, setting out Tuesday for Ohio with stops in Columbus, Akron
and Lima and an overnight in Detroit.
   Bush will spend Wednesday in Michigan, South Dakota and Montana,
Thursday in Washington state and California, Friday in California
and Nebraska and Saturday in Illinois.

   Bears have invaded towns in western Japan to search
for food, and residents have been told to carry whistles and bells
and play radios to scare them away.
   Residents of Toyama, a state about 160 miles west of Tokyo, have
seen more than 30 bears foraging through towns, said Minoru
Arakawa, a spokesman for the state. Nine of the animals were killed
or captured this month.
   Officials said this year's sparse crop of the wild fruit the
bears eat in their mountain habitat drove the animals toward
residential areas.
   Authorities have told people to throw hats or other clothes on
the ground to divert the attention of bears they may encounter.

   With the smell of burning cedar filling
the hall, hundreds of delegates from as far away as Alaska and
North Carolina gathered Monday for the opening of the National
Congress of American Indians.
   ``I think we'll have a good turnout because it's an election
year,'' said John Blackhawk, chairman of the Winnebago tribe of
Nebraska, which is host for the gathering.
   The group opened the weeklong meeting by burning cedar to purify
the hall, and by singing a traditional prayer song in which they
asked the nation's leaders to listen to Indian concerns.
   ``We need to take an overall view of Indian country and the
problems that we need to address,'' said John F. Gonzales, chairman
of the congress. ``In some people's minds the organization has lost
sight of what we should be focusing our efforts on.''
   Gonzales called for unity from the more than 300 tribes
represented in the group, which is one of the nation's oldest and
largest Indian organizations.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., a Cheyenne Indian, spoke
to the group Monday.
   He said Indians can no longer rely on the Bureau of Indian
Affairs to carry their concerns to Washington.
   ``It's a heck of a lot easier to make change on the inside than
on the outside,'' he said. ``Indians must get involved in the
political process.''
   The congress is expected to formulate positions on issues
ranging from hunting and fishing to treaty rights and AIDS, which
will be presented to the next president of the United States.

<HEAD>Dukakis Raps Bush's `Outright Lies,' Predicts Upset Victory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today accused Republican
rival George Bush of waging a campaign of ``outright lies'' and
turning his back on average Americans with a plan to give a huge
tax break to himself and other wealthy people.
   The Democratic nominee told a rally of supporters that he _ like
the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers _ was headed toward
an upset victory in the Nov. 8 election.
   Dukakis said the Bush campaign was based on distortions and
misrepresentations of his record as Massachusetts governor. He
promised to ``take my case directly to you'' in the two remaining
weeks of the presidential campaign.
   ``You know, Mark Twain once said that a lie can travel half way
around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes,''
Dukakis told the rally at the outset of a full day of campaigning
in California.
   ``Mr. Bush must have read Mark Twain,'' Dukakis said. ``Because
he's running a campaign based on distortions and distractions _ and
outright lies. Why? Because he can't win an election where the real
issues are discussed, the real challenges are faced and the real
differences are made known.''
   Campaigning as an underdog populist, Dukakis criticized the vice
president's proposal for a capital gains tax credit, which Dukakis
said would give Bush an annual tax break of $22,000.
   ``George Bush wants to give people like George Bush a tax break
that's more than the average California worker makes in a year,''
Dukakis said. ``Look beside you. Look behind you. Look in the
mirror and ask yourself: Is George Bush on your side?''
   Responding in a speech at Portland, Maine, the vice president
said: ``I will push for a cut in the capital gains tax for a very
simple reason _ it's not to favor the rich; it will help create
jobs.''
   ``My opponent calls this typically a tax cut for the rich,''
Bush said. ``He's wrong. He's dead wrong.''
   The Democratic nominee told a boisterous rally on his arrival
Sunday night at Burbank, Calif., that Bush's disavowal of a GOP
campaign brochure fell far short of what was need to restore the
proper tone to the contest. The brochure said murderers and rapists
supported Dukakis.
   ``When you put garbage out in the street, you've got a
responsibility to clean it up,'' Dukakis told the cheering
supporters at the Burbank airport.
   Dukakis said Bush and his fellow Republicans have ``resorted to
distortions and misrepresentations, outright lying,'' because they
``don't want to deal with the real issues and real challenges that
face our nation.''
   The Massachusetts governor invoked the Los Angeles Dodgers, the
underdog winners last week of the baseball World Series, in
promising an Election Day upset.
   ``You know and I know the Dodgers weren't supposed to win
either,'' Dukakis said. ``Yeah, we're a little bit behind, but
we're fighting back.''
   Dukakis was spending all of today in California, the biggest
Electoral College prize with 47 votes, beginning his day by meeting
with supporters and members of the Asian-American community of Los
Angeles.
   He arrived here after a flight from Boston that included a
refueling stop in Eau Claire, Wis., where Dukakis addressed a rally
of about 600 people gathered on a chilly night inside a hangar.
   There he began a new campaign week essentially where he left off
last week _ assailing the tone of the Republican campaign.
   Dukakis said Bush has distorted his record and positions on
several issues and for the first time he raised Bush's disavowal of
the Illinois campaign brochure.
   ``Disavowal isn't enough,'' said Dukakis, who last week referred
to the brochure as ``garbage.''
   ``Let's get that stuff out of this campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis, whose new campaign commercials denounce GOP distortions
of his positions, said Bush has wrongly told farm-state audiences
the Democratic ticket supports an embargo on grain sales to the
Soviet Union.
   ``We don't'' Dukakis said. ``We never have. We never will. He
knows that.''
   Dukakis also singled out gun control and accused both Bush and
the National Rifle Association of distorting his views.
   ``I've always supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen to
have weapons and to use them,'' Dukakis said, adding that his major
concern was the availability of handguns and automatic weapons to
inner-city children.
   Dukakis urged those at the rally to ``set the record straight
among your neighbors and friends.''
   Dukakis, continuing an effort he began last week, planned to
keep a high television profile in the two weeks leading to the
election. He was appearing tonight on Larry King's talk show on the
Cable News Network and for 90 minutes Tuesday on ABC's
``Nightline.''
   He also has purchased five-minute slots on the networks this
Tuesday, Sunday, Nov. 1 and Nov. 5, as well as a half-hour on the
three major broadcast networks on election eve.
   Meanwhile, aides accused Bush of allowing racist appeals to
permeate his campaign message, specifically in his attack on a
Massachusetts furlough program that granted a weekend pass to a
murderer who escaped and raped a Maryland woman. The inmate is
black, the victim white.
   Flying to Connecticut this morning for a campaign tour of New
England, the vice president asserted that ``there isn't any
racism'' in his TV ads about Horton, and said the Democrats were
merely engaged in desperation tactics.
   Dukakis' running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, said Sunday he
believed there were racist appeals in the Bush message.
   Campaign vice chairman John Sasso told reporters Dukakis agreed
with Bentsen. Dukakis himself refused to answer when asked if he
agreed with his running mate, offering only a shrug.
   Dukakis aides, seeking to bolster their case, distributed copies
of an Atlanta Constitution column in which a Bush aide is quoted as
saying of Dukakis:
   ``We are going to show he is so far left he's to the left of
collard greens, black-eyed peas and strip-row cotton.'' The quote
was attributed to Chris Henick, Bush's Southern regional director.

   ``This election will determine whether the Reagan revolution

   The Free Press said Dukakis ``is not a charismatic Dr. Feel

   Descendants of Civil War soldiers came
to Jacksonville to pay tribute to a Confederate veteran whose
tombstone was brought home with full military honors.
   The tombstone was engraved to remember James Robert Houston, a
Confederate sergeant who died in 1909. It was found this spring
buried in a flower garden in Saginaw, Mich.
   Officials have no idea how the the tombstone got to Michigan but
speculate that a tourist took it from a Tampa cemetery as a
souvenir in the 1920s.
   The silence of the oak and magnolia-shaded Evergreen Cemetery
was shattered Sunday by a 21-gun salute from a troop of
gray-uniformed Confederate re-enactment soldiers.
   Several of Houston's descendants were visibly moved when a man
portraying a Union Army bugler played taps in tribute.
   ``It was fantastic, all the people who helped us who didn't know
us. There is no way we can thank them all, because there were so
many. It shows that there is still a lot of decency out there,''
said Hans Huntsinger, Houston's great grandson.
   Houston died in Tampa and is buried there, but there is no
record of the exact location. Relatives decided to place Houston's
tombstone beside that of his widow, Mary Draper Houston, who died
in 1950.

<HEAD>Parents Haven't Asked Why Daughter Informed on Her Mother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of the chief prosecution witness in
the Bess Myerson divorce-fixing case says neither he nor his wife
has asked their daughter why she agreed to testify when her own
mother is one of the defendants.
   Sukhreet Gabel, 39, allegedly was used by Miss Myerson to get to
her mother, former Justice Hortense Gabel. Mrs. Gabel was handling
the divorce case of Miss Myerson's boyfriend, Carl Capasso. All
three are defendants in the bribery conspiracy case in federal
court.
   The prosecution maintains that Miss Myerson, a former Miss
America who was city cultural affairs commissioner, hired the
daughter in 1983 and that in return, Mrs. Gabel reduced Capasso's
alimony.
   In addition to testifying for the prosecution, Ms. Gabel taped a
telephone conversation with her mother for investigators and handed
over documents belonging to her mother.
   ``Neither of us have asked her anything,'' Milton Gabel was
quoted as telling columnist Cindy Adams in Monday's New York Post.
``It's very strange that Sukhreet did this. How can you raise a
daughter all your life and then accept that she can do this?''
   Ms. Gabel, 39, lives on an allowance from her parents and will
come into money under her mother's will, Gabel said.
   ``She's our daughter, but she's always done odd things,'' Gabel,
a dentist, said.
   Asked if he loved his daughter, he said: ``I have a harder time
with that than my wife does.
   ``Sukhreet is brilliant but she's always been odd. I guess it's
sort of a mental thing. Like after she graduated from the U.N.
School, she wanted to just travel around the world and do nothing
for two years. She almost never seems to work.''
   Ms. Gabel had been job-hunting 18 months when Myerson gave her a
$19,000-a-year job to be what the witness has described as a
glorified ``gofer.''
   Gabel said that although his daughter lives a block away, she
did not visit her parents until the conspiracy case began to unfold.
   ``She never came near us,'' he said. ``She never invited us. She
never made dinner for us.''
   ``Still, we're supporting her,'' he said. ``Horty's pension and
Social Security is divided with Sukhreet. And we'll continue to
support her. She's our child.''
   Mrs. Gabel, 75, retired from the bench last year, citing poor
health.
   The Post said the daughter's allowance from her parents is
$1,700 a month.
   Ms. Gabel, named Julie at birth, became enamored of things
Indian after she dropped out of school at age 16 and took a job at
the India pavilion of the New York World's Fair. She changed her
name to Sukhreet, dyed her fair hair black and adopted Indian dress.
   Her marriage in 1975 to Dutch diplomat Jan Revis ended in
divorce.

<HEAD>Warn Against Unofficial Demonstrations on Independence Date</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Monday issued a
stern warning against staging an unofficial demonstration on the
70th anniversary of Czechoslovak independence.
   Five independent groups have vowed to ignore a such a ban and
demonstrate on the anniversary, which is Friday.
   ``Some individuals and groups want to abuse the 70th anniversary
... for their anti-Socialist objectives,'' the state news agency
CTK said.
   An information bulletin adopted by the Czechoslovak Communist
Party's Politburo on Aug. 25 reveals that a ban on unauthorized
public gatherings was already agreed upon three months before it
was announced last week.
   The London-based Palach Press, a newsletter monitoring human
rights violations and other developments in Czechoslovakia, said
the five groups regard the ban as ``illegal and
anti-constitutional.'' They were the Charter 77 human rights group,
the Indpendent Peace Association, the Democratic Initiative, the
Czech Children and the Society for Friendship with the United
States.
   Palach Press said representatives of these groups sent a letter
Sunday to the Prague authorities explaining why two legal
provisions cited for the ban were inapplicable. They also made
clear they will go ahead with Friday's demonstration despite the
official ban.
   Palach Press also reported that a forum of the Independent Peace
Association was disrupted Saturday by several hundred armed police
and people's militiamen, who arrived in the village Lbin near
Litomerice in northern Bohemia, some three hours after the arrival
of the first busload of activists.
   Bohemia and Moravia form the Czech Republic, which together with
Slovakia makes up the Czechoslovak state.
   The second bus was stopped on the way to the forum, and all
activists were detained. Several of them, including Tomas Dvorak,
Ondrej Cerny and Jakub Kaplan, have not been heard from since and
were believed to be in detention, Palach Press reported.
   An emigre source in Vienna who asked not to be identified said
the Politburo information sheet was distributed to all party
organizations and groups for use at party meetings on different
levels.
   The document adopted four days after police broke up a major
demonstration of regime critics on the 20th anniversary of the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, recently was circulated
among dissidents in Prague.
   CTK did not identify any individuals and groups but said ``they
are distributing various provocative declarations, including
appeals for participation in an illegal meeting in Prague.''
   Referring to an existing ban on unauthorized public gatherings,
CTK said, ``All anti-Socialist actions are organized in close

   An explosion rocked a shopping center
in the Pakistani capital Monday night, injuring two people, police
said.
   The 11-pound bomb exploded about 7:30 p.m. in a cluster of
clothing shops in Jinnah Market, a rectangle of businesses in
central Islamabad frequented by Pakistanis and foreigners.
   The explosion occurred on the eve of the birthday of the Prophet
Mohammed more than 1,400 years ago. It is a national holiday in
this Moslem nation.
   The two Pakistanis who were injured were not seriously hurt,
said Police Superintendant Javed Noor.
   Glass and plastic from about 10 shop signs littered the sidewalk
around the popular market with clothing, souvenirs, jewelry stores
and restaurants.
   It was the second blast in Islamabad in 24 hours. On Sunday
night, a bomb exploded in a bus at the city's main bus stand. Nine
people were injured, four seriously.
   Officials have blamed scores of terrorist bombings the past two
years on agents of neighboring Afghanistan's communist government.
   Pakistan and the United States back Moslem rebels fighting the
Soviet-supported Kabul government.

<HEAD>Quayle Says Charges of GOP Racism `Totally Absurd'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle said Monday it is ``totally
absurd'' for Democrats to suggest that the Republican are making
racist appeals in the presidential campaign.
   GOP nominee George Bush's vice presidential running mate labeled
the allegations a political diversionary tactic.
   Quayle said the charges by his Democratic counterpart, Lloyd
Bentsen, and by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and others reflected
desperation among supporters of the flagging candidacy of
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``It's totally absurd. I think it shows just how desperate they
really are to start fanning the fires of racism in this country.
It's totally unfounded,'' Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign
plane as he flew from Washington to Missouri.
   Bentsen and Jackson alleged last weekend that the Bush campaign
was sending a racial message by hammering Dukakis over the case of
black convicted murderer Willie Horton Jr., who raped a white woman
in Maryland last year after he had escaped from a Massachusetts
prison furlough.
   ``Our opponents have begun a massive campaign of disinformation,
a concerted effort to divert this campaign away from the issues
that George Bush and I have raised,'' Quayle told a rally at Fox
Senior High School in this small town outside St. Louis.
   ``If I had to defend the Dukakis record, I'd look for
diversions, too,'' the Indiana senator said.
   Quayle attacked what he called the Massachusetts governor's
``pathetic positions in the area of national defense and crime.''
   When reporters asked about Jackson's contention that the
Republicans are using the word liberal to refer negatively to civil
rights activists, Quayle replied, ``Tthat's absolutely absurd to
say that liberal has some sort of racial connotation. Liberalism is
a political philosophy.''
   Stumping for votes in Missouri, a state with 11 electoral votes
where the presidential race is considered close, Quayle accused
Dukakis of being ``afraid of sharing his true ideology wih the
voters of America.''
   After his speech, Quayle walked up and down the aisles of the
crowded high school auditorium taking questions from the students.
   After stating his firm opposition to abortion, Quayle was asked
if he would feel the same way if his wife had been raped and become
pregnant.
   Quayle paused only slightly before saying the decision would be
left to his wife, Marilyn, although he hoped she would avoid an
abortion.
   ``If that situation happened, which would be tragic, it would be
tough not only on Marilyn, but tough on me and tough on our
children. But if that happened, I would think that she would, and I
would hope she would have _ as tough as it may be _ have the child
rather than the abortion.''
   Replying to another student, Quayle said he would do again
``exactly what I did'' when he joined the Indiana National Guard
rather than fight in Vietnam.
   Quayle planned two other campaign stops in Missouri, which he
called ``a tossup state,'' before flying to Kentucky.
   One scheduled appearance was to tour a Job Training Partnership
Act program in Union, Mo. Quayle cites his sponsorship of the job
training legislation as one of his chief legislative
accomplishments.

   An arms dealer went on trial in federal court
Monday on charges that he exported a demilitarized helicopter,
armored seats and gun mounts to Surinam.
   Ruel Peter Playfair-Scott has been an arms dealer for eight
years, his attorney said. Peter Playfair, as he is known, operates
from Miami.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Dubelier said during opening
statements that Playfair and a Surinam consular official from Miami
bought the helicopter in Panama City, Fla., in 1987.
   Playfair arranged to have it sent to Surinam by ship, although
he had been notified that the helicopter and the other equipment
were on a U.S. government list of items not to be shipped to
certain countries, Dubelier said.
   The cargo arrived in Surinam but was held on orders from U.S.
officials and eventually returned to the United States.
   Defense attorney Kent Wheeler said evidence will show there was
no intent to break the law and that Playfair was given incorrect
information by government agents concerning the legality of the
shipment.
   He also said the helicopter, gun mount and armored seats
actually were en route to Georgetown, Guyana, and were not supposed
to be unloaded in Surinam, a small country in South America with a
military government.
   The case is being tried before U.S. District Judge Kenneth
Ryskamp.

<TEXT>
   Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian group
holding two U.S. hostages, said Monday it was not linked to the
Lebanese woman arrested in Italy with photographs of captive
Americans.
   The group claimed the woman, Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36, had
ties to Israel's secret service.
   Islamic Jihad challenged Italian authorities to publish a
photograph of American hostage Terry Anderson that was found in the
woman's luggage at Milan airport last Thursday.
   ``What has been said about about the presence of a photograph of
captive Anderson is sheer fabrication and is absolutely devoid of
truth,'' Islamic Jihad said in a typewritten Arabic-language
statement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut.
   The 15-line communique was delivered with an photograph of
Anderson to authenticate it.
   The kidnappers apparently did not know that authorities in Milan
had already released a copy of the photograph of Anderson that was
discovered in the woman's luggage.
   ``We hold Italian authorities fully responsible for
collaborating in a malicious conspiracy aimed at besmirching our
image in the eyes of public opinion. This will not go unpunished,''
the Islamic Jihad statement said.
   Milan police said two other photographs, at least one of them
showing another American captive, Alann Steen, were found in the
woman's luggage along with a letter bearing Steen's name, $1,000 in
counterfeit bills and 1.7 ounces of heroin.
   The statement today was the third in recent days from Islamic
Jihad, which holds Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson
and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   Anderson and Sutherland are among nine Americans held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Anderson, kidnapped March 16, 1985,
is the longest held hostage.

<HEAD>Mother Superior At Carmelite Monastery Breaks Four Day Vow Of
Silence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The embattled mother superior of a
Carmelite monastery said Monday there will be no more attempts to
persuade five rebel nuns to end nearly three weeks of isolation in
the infirmary.
   The five cloistered nuns locked themselves in the infirmary Oct.
4 to forestall eviction by the Diocese of Paterson, which has since
accused the sisters of being disobedient. The nuns oppose attempts
by their prioress, Mother Teresa Hewitt, to modernize life at the
13-member community by introducing such things as television, radio
and candy.
   The five have vowed not to end their vigil until they hear
directly from the Vatican, where the sisters have appealed the
diocese's order that they vacate the monastery.
   On Monday, Mother Teresa broke four days of silence by issuing a
statement that said ``there will be no more news on the issue of
Carmel of Morristown until a decision is sent to us by the
Vatican.''
   The prioress and the five sisters agreed last Thursday to
observe a period of prayer and reflection over the weekend after
two and a half weeks of intense scrutiny from reporters from as far
away as Italy.
   Sister Eliane, a nun at the monestary who is not involved in the
dispute, said that the five are still locked in the infirmary but
that they are well provided for.

   Prosecutors showed a videotape of a
1985 fatal soccer riot Monday at the trial of 26 Britons charged
with involuntary manslaughter in the clash.
   The 60-minute tape showed rioting British fans tearing down a
flimsy fence and charging Italian supporters before a championship
match at Heysel Stadium. Thirty-nine people were killed and more
than 500 were injured.
   Judge Pierre Verlynde later adjourned the proceedings for two
days to study a defense motion to read aloud the prosecution's
48,000-page file of charges and supporting evidence at the trial if
they do not get a free copy of the file.
   The reading could delay the trial for months, officials said.
   Only two of the 26 British defendants showed up Monday. Verlynde
angered defense lawyers when he declined to hear arguments from
those lawyers whose clients were absent. Some defense lawyers
briefly threatened to walk out.
   On Sept. 18, the court let 14 defendants go home, but they were
due to return Monday. Two other defendants are in jail in Britain
on unrelated charges.
   Defense lawyers acknowledged that the demand to read the bulky
file made little sense, but they said they needed a free copy so
they could study it.
   The court provides a copy of the file but does not permit the
defense lawyers to take it home.
   Verlynde said the defense based its argument on a rule put into
effect when many defendants were still illiterate.
   But the defense contended the Britons, who do not speak French,
fell under such a ruling. The trial, which began Oct. 17, is
conducted in French.
   The British defendants face up to 10 years in jail if convicted.
   Two Belgian police officers and a former Belgian soccer
federation chairman also are on trial, accused of providing lax
security at the 1985 European Cup soccer final between Liverpool
and Juventus Turin of Italy.
   The Belgian defendants face up to two years in jail.
   The TV footage of the riots led to the extradition of 26 Britons
last year. It showed British fans charging into the neighboring
stand and beginning the fatal stampede.
   English soccer clubs have been banned competing in Europe's
three main cup tournaments since the riot.

   The USS Vincennes ended a tragedy-marred
deployment today, returning to its homeport more than three months
after it mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian
Gulf.
   Sailors dressed in Navy whites lined the deck of the Aegis
cruiser, which sported a red, white and blue paper wreath at its
bow and carried a sign declaring the crew's love for San Diego and
America.
   Hundreds of relatives, awaiting a reunion with sailors absent
for six months, released a cloud of red, white and blue balloons as
the ship docked. A Navy band played ``California Here We Come'' and
the ``Vincennes March.''
   ``New fathers are going to be seeing new kids for the first
time,'' Senior Chief Petty Officer Steve Hiney said. ``The wives
and girlfriends, mothers and fathers are going to be there.''
   The welcoming for the cruiser's 400-member crew was to include a
Navy band and remarks by Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif., and William
Rose, mayor of Vincennes, Ind. The ship was named for a
Revolutionary War battle at Vincennes.
   Navy officials wanted to ensure that the crew's return from an
extended deployment wasn't perceived by the public as ``one of
those Vietnam things with the ship coming in at midnight,'' said
Navy spokesman Cmdr. David Dillon.
   ``We're inviting people to watch,'' he said. ``People understand
this was an arduous deployment. The sailors have a lot of public
support.''
   Ending the Vincennes' tragedy-marred deployment with a
``normal'' greeting is the best way to smooth the sailors' reunion
with their families and society, said Dr. Thomas Rusk, a clinical
associate professor of psychiatry.
   ``These people did the best they could. It's terrific that they
are being welcomed home just like anybody else,'' said Rusk, who
also works with police officers involved in shootings and counseled
Air Force personnel while in the service.
   The Vincennes, equipped with the Navy's modern Aegis combat
control system, accidently downed the Iranian civilian aircraft
over the Persian Gulf on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard.
   The official Pentagon report concluded the crew mistook the
airliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter jet and said crew members
misintrepreted computer and radar data because of stress in their
first combat situation. At the time, the Vincennes was engaged in a
firefight with several Iranian gunboats.
   Lowery organized a volunteer effort that gathered 10,000
signatures and sent the messages of support to the crew in the
Persian Gulf after the tragedy.
   ``I empathized with how low the crew, the officers and the
skipper (Capt. Will Rogers III) were feeling,'' Lowery said. ``I
just wanted to let them know that we understood.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was
reported in good condition Monday at Georgetown University Hospital
recovering from surgery for breast cancer.
   But while officials at the hospital and the court said the
58-year-old justice's condition was good, they would not provide
any details about the nature of her surgery, which took place
Friday, or her postoperative treatment. Normally, breast cancer
patients receive some treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation
to prevent a recurrence.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that O'Connor underwent
a mastectomy, removal of the breast, rather than removal of just a
malignant tumor, called a lumpectomy.
   Dr. Christine Berg, a cancer specialist at Georgetown University
Medical School, told the newspaper she was familiar with the case
and that O'Connor had a mastectomy.
   ``Her tumor was more extensive than could be handled by a
lumpectomy alone,'' Dr. Berg was quoted as saying.
   Dr. Berg, who did not take part in performing the surgery, told
The Associated Press on Monday she could not confirm that the
operation was a mastectomy. ``I'm not 100 percent certain,'' she
said.
   The hospital also declined to say whether lymph nodes were
removed from under O'Connor's arm in the surgery and what test
results if any from the nodes were available.
   The National Cancer Institute says the five-year survival rate
for breast cancer patients whose cancer is confined to the breast
is greater than 85 percent. If the cancer has spread to the lymph
nodes, the survival rate drops to 70 percent or less.
   Dr. Robert S. Siegel, director of cancer treatment at George
Washington University Hospital, said in an interview that typically
the lymph glands are removed whether the patient undergoes a
mastectomy or lumpectomy.
   O'Connor released an earlier statement that said she intends to
be back at the Supreme Court on Oct. 31 when the justices return
from a two-week recess to resume hearing oral arguments.
   She already was doing some work from her hospital room.
   She issued an order Monday temporarily shielding Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Co. from having to pay a $4 million damage award to a
Minnesota service station attendant injured by an exploding tire.
   O'Connor granted an emergency request by Goodyear to extend a
lower court order permitting the company to withhold the money
pending action by the full Supreme Court on a formal Goodyear
appeal.

<HEAD>Government Troops Battle Karen Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops and Karen guerrillas
demanding autonomy for their northern region fought fierce battles
Monday, a government spokesman said.
   The number of casualties was not immediately known, said
spokesman Kyaw Sann.
   The fighting occurred near the village of Maethawaw, about 130
miles north of Rangoon on Moei River, which forms a border between
Burma and Thailand.
   Authorities dropped leaflets over rebel-controlled areas urging
students who have joined the insurgents to return home under an
amnesty. The students led massive anti-government demonstrations in
August for democracy and an end to one-party rule.
   The leaflets, which Kyaw Sann showed reporters, say students
will be received at 27 special centers in the border area before
being sent home, and no action will be taken against them if they
have not committed criminal offenses.
   The ethnic Karen guerrillas first attacked the camps near
Methawaw on Sept. 26. The Karens, who are fighting for the autonomy
of the area along the border, form the strongest of Burma's dozen
insurgencies. Karens represent about 2 million of Burma's 38
million people.
   Two of the five government camps surrounding the village fell to
the rebels in mid-October.
   Last week, a series of clashes with rebels in the state of
Kachin in northern Burma claimed the lives of 17 soldiers, wounding
23 others, Kyaw Sann said.
   On Oct. 18, seven rebels were killed in battles that began when
the Kachins, one of the guerrilla groups that have fought the
central government for decades, attacked a police outpost in Myo
Thit, about 500 miles north of Rangoon.
   The government suffered its heaviest casualties when rebels in
Kachin ambushed a government convoy near Myo Thit, killing 15
soldiers.
   In eastern Burma, nine military personnel were killed and 24
wounded when about 450 Burma Communist Party rebels ambushed a
troop convoy on Oct. 19 in Mong Yang, about 500 miles northeast of
Rangoon near the Chinese border, Kyaw Sann said. Two rebels were
killed, he said.
   The communist rebels were driven back in late September by
Burmese troops but returned to the area around Mong Yang,
apparently determined to occupy the town, the spokesman said.
   In another development in Rangoon, gasoline rationing for
private cars resumed on Monday, two months after sales were
suspended because of declining supplies.
   Car owners are allowed to buy between three and four gallons of
gasoline a week, depending on the size of their vehicle, the
government said.
   Gasoline was sold in the capital for 80 cents a gallon, up from
18 cents before sales were suspended on Aug. 25 after nationwide
strikes that disrupted production.
   The strikes were called by tens of thousands of demonstrating
students demanding free elections after ruler Ne Win, who came to
power in a 1062 coup, resigned in July. He was replaced by Gen.
Sein Lwin, who was forced to step down Aug. 13 by anti-government
riots. On Aug. 19, Maung Maung, a Western-educated lawyer, became
Burma's first civilian president since 1962.
   On Sept. 18, Gen. Saw Maung seized power and troops stopped
demonstrations by killing hundreds of people on the streets.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas said Monday they
captured a provincial capital in northeastern Afghanistan, their
fifth since the start of the Soviet withdrawal in May.
   There was no independent confirmation.
   The Afghan News Agency, operated by the Hezb-i-Islami
guerrillas, said Mahmud-i-Raqi, 33 miles north of the Afghan
capital of Kabul, fell to its fighters Sunday.
   The guerrillas claimed Mahmud-i-Raqi fell after two days of
intense fighting in which about 100 Afghan government soldiers were
killed and 83 were captured. It claimed only four guerrillas were
wounded.
   The province has long been reported the domain of the rival
Jamiat-i-Islami group, which has kept the capital under siege.
   ``This is the first I heard of it,'' said Jamiat spokesman Basir
from his Peshawar, Pakistan headquarters.
   Hezb-i-Islami said guerrillas destroyed 21 tanks and captured
three. It also captured trucks, and light and heavy weapons.
   Western diplomats previously confirmed the guerrilla takeovers
of Kunar and Paktika provinces in the east, Takhar in the north and
Bamyan in central Afghanistan. All had been abandoned by
withdrawing Soviet troops, guerrillas said.
   Also Monday, Jamiat leader Burhanuddin Rabbani criticized U.N.
mediator Diego Cordovez for alleging guerrilla disunity and calling
for the formation of an Afghan government including communists and
Moslem guerrillas.
   Cordovez ``allows himself to interfere in the domestic affairs
of Afghanistan and to request certain individuals to form _ or help
to form _ the future government of Afghanistan,'' said Rabbani,
chairman of the seven-party guerrilla alliance, in a statement to
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``We also wonder how Mr. Cordovez gives himself the right to
interfere in our affairs while he himself stated that only the
Afghans can decide their future,'' the message said.
   Cordovez mediated the U.N.-sponsored accord last spring in which
Moscow agreed to withdraw its more than 100,000 troops from
Afghanistan between May 15 and Feb. 15, 1989.
   The guerrillas, not a party to the negotiations, have rejected
the accord although they have scored a string of victories against
government troops since the pullout began.
   Guerrilla leaders repeatedly have rejected suggestions of
sharing power with the Marxist government of President Najib.
   The governing People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized
power in a bloody 1978 coup. Soviet troops intervened in December
1979 and have been fighting the U.S.-backed guerrillas ever since.

   The family of a 21-year-old woman
who has been comatose for six years marked her birthday Monday with
a quiet party by her bedside, the Bernama news agency reported.
   Merlyn Ann Jeremiah is resting at a private hospital in Penang,
about 180 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur.
   Merlyn, who occasionally smiles without talking, slipped into a
coma in 1982 after undergoing a minor operation on her ankle.
   A family member said the birthday party was held in the hope
that she may awake one day.

authorities said.
   Arthur Jones, 17, approached an AstroWorld security guard late
Saturday night and told him he had been shot. Paramedics treated
the victim before he was taken by ambulance to a hospital.
   A few minutes before Jones appeared, security officers had
investigated reports of a fight in the Coney Island section of the

<HEAD>Boxcar Odyssey Underscores Larger Problem of Radioactive Waste
Disposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A steel-lined boxcar of low-level radioactive
waste returned to the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant Monday
after being rejected by Idaho, leaving in its tracks troubling
questions about how the nation handles its atomic leftovers.
   The boxcar, ordered out of Idaho by Gov. Cecil Andrus on
Saturday, was shunted to a siding at the Rocky Flats plant 16 miles
northwest of Denver on Monday morning while officials debated what
to do.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer on Sunday turned down a Department of
Energy request to expand storage facilities for low-level
radioactive waste at Rocky Flats and asked that the Department of
Energy not unload the rail car, which contains 140 drums of waste
at 55 gallons per drum.
   The state now allows storage of up to 1,600 cubic yards of
radioactive waste at Rocky Flats, and the plant legally could
accommodate the boxcar's cargo without exceeding the limit,
officials said.
   ``We'll cooperate with the DOE to find an alternative site until
(a proposed disposal facility in) New Mexico is open,'' Romer said
Monday. ``But I've said, `Look, no expansion of Rocky Flats.'''
   Romer said he would press for a meeting of Western governors to
discuss a long-term solution to the problem and planned to talk to
DOE officials in the meantime.
   It was the second time recently that Rocky Flats' operations
have come under the spotlight. Earlier this month, the plant's
plutonium reprocessing facility was closed by the DOE after three
workers were exposed to radioactive material inside. Building 771
remains closed, but production of plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons continues at the plant, officials said.
   Andrus put the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory off-limits
to further radioactive waste disposal last week to hasten DOE's
opening of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M.
   ``If they can't handle the waste, they shouldn't be generating
it,'' Andrus said Monday on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program.
``They won't be shipping it into Idaho.''
   There was no indication how long the boxcar might have to sit at
Rocky Flats. ``A position hasn't been defined yet,'' said DOE
spokesman Ben McCarty in a telephone interview from Albuquerque,
N.M.
   The Washington state governor's office issued a statement Monday
that said the boxcar would be accepted at the Hanford nuclear
reservation in eastern Washington. ``We'll accept the waste if it
gets this far,'' said Dick Milne, press secretary for Gov. Booth
Gardner. ``We just don't believe it would be safe to let the waste
continue to sit in the boxcar.''
   Romer's office had no immediate response to the offer.
   Although the radioactive material in the boxcar is stored in
specially lined steel drums considered safe to handle, longtime
critics of Rocky Flats expressed concern.
   ``I've got to tell you it's unacceptable to have this
transuranic waste sitting in a rail car,'' said Jan Pilcher, a
spokeswoman for the American Friends Service Committee, a
persistent critic of Rocky Flats for the past decade. ``He's
(Romer) got to press to have this removed. The least viable option
is to have this sitting in a rail car.''
   ``The WIPP facility in New Mexico was to be the long-term answer
to the problem,'' said Ed Heintz, director of communications for
Rockwell International, which operates Rocky Flats for the DOE.
   Congress' failure to pass land transfer legislation this year
forced the Energy Department to scrap the scheduled October opening
date for WIPP, and the facility probably won't open until early
next year. Radioactive wastes would be buried 2,000 feet
underground in salt deposits at the site.
   With Andrus' refusal to allow further radioactive waste
shipments to Idaho, there now is no central disposal site for
wastes produced by 10 facilities in the nation's nuclear weapons
production system, said McCarty.
   ``Idaho was the only central storage site that accepted waste
from other places,'' he said.
   Idaho officials said Rocky Flats was the chief shipper of
low-level radioactive wastes to the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory site in Idaho Falls. For the last 20 years, Rocky Flats
shipped an average of 55 boxcars of waste to Idaho annually. The
waste is a mix of contaminated rags, machine parts, gloves, liquids
and other debris.
   The Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, the Lawrence
Livermore laboratory near San Francisco and the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory itself were other waste contributors,
officials have said. An estimated 2 million cubic feet of the waste
is stored below ground and 2.4 million cubic feet is in steel
barrels on above-ground pads at the Idaho facility, officials have
said.
   McCarty said the plants now will have to store their radioactive
waste on-site _ as do the other six plants in the nuclear weapons
network _ until the WIPP facility can open.
   He said that in addition to congressional approval of
legislation transferring the land from the Bureau of Land Managment
to the DOE, approval is needed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
of the TRUPACT II container, in which the wastes would be placed.
And he said the state of New Mexico must change its laws so that
the small amount of chemical hazardous waste that also would be
stored at WIPP would be accounted for legally.

   Three elk trapped on a ledge were killed
over the weekend and two of the carcasses were donated to the
Dolores County Welfare Department, a state Division of Wildlife
official said today.
   The state had asked a hunter to kill the two cows and one calf,
stuck on a 12-foot by 80-foot ledge six feet below the top of a
cliff.
   Wildlife officers accompanied the hunter to Disappointment
Valley Saturday, but because of the difficult terrain the hunter
was unable to get into position to shoot the elk.
   A wildlife division officer shot two of the elk, and the other
fell off the ledge, said Mike Zgainer of the wildlife division
office in Durango.
   The elk were beginning to show the effects of hunger by late in
the week.
   The stranded elk were reported early last week, shortly after
elk season opened, by a rancher who complained that the wildlife
division planned to do nothing to rescue the three animals.
   Kip Stransky of the wildlife division said that after the
animals were killed, the hunting party made a sling and lowered the
carcasses from the ledge. The meat will be donated to the county
welfare department to help feed the poor.

<TEXT>
   Israel's warplanes destroyed a south
Lebanon guerrilla base Monday and its soldiers intercepted a
raiding party that apparently sought to seize Israeli hostages.
   Soldiers and militiamen of the surrogate South Lebanon Army in
Israel's self-proclaimed south Lebanon ``security zone'' stormed a
house and freed a Shiite family held hostage by seven guerrillas,
the militia and Israeli army reported.
   Police in south Lebanon said one guerrilla was wounded in the
strike by two jets making the second Israeli air raid into Lebanon
in five days. They said the base was used by the leftist Syrian
Social Nationalist Party, a militia backed by Syria.
   The air attacks followed a suicide car-bombing that killed eight
Israeli soldiers last Wednesday in the security zone, which ranges
from 6 to 10 miles deep just north of the border between Israel and
Lebanon.
   At the United Nations in New York, Lebanon lodged a formal
protest of Israeli air raids. Ambassador Rachid Fakhoury made the
protest in a letter to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
circulated Monday.
   Israeli jets rocketed the one-story building used by the
guerrillas in Beit Lehia village near Mashgara at 1:30 p.m. Monday,
police reported. They said four other houses were damaged in the
raid on the village 9 miles north of the security zone.
   A statement by the Israeli military command said the base had
been used for guerrilla attacks into northern Israel. It gave no
details, but said the warplanes returned safely to base.
   The SSNP advocates a greater Syria incorporating Lebanon,
Jordan, Iraq, pre-Israel Palestine, Kuwait and Cyprus.
   It has bases behind Syrian army lines in the Bekaa Valley of
eastern Lebanon and in other parts of the country. The group has
not claimed responsibility for recent guerrilla attacks, but
carried out several car bombings in the security zone in 1986 and
1987.
   Monday's raid was the 17th Israeli air strike inside Lebanon
this year. By police count, 89 people have been killed and 143
wounded.
   Twenty-one people were killed and 34 wounded in Friday's air
raid on Palestinian and pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem guerrilla bases
in south Lebanon.
   Military officials in Israel said soldiers captured two
Palestinian guerrillas Monday who planned to enter Israel on a
hostage-taking mission. Israel radio said the third guerrilla
escaped.
   According to the radio report, one guerrilla of Nayef Hawatmeh's
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine was wounded in the
encounter before dawn on the northern slopes of Mount Dov in south
Lebanon. No army casualties were reported.
   Israeli soldiers and their militia allies killed four guerrillas
of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine on
Sunday on the slopes of Mount Hermon.
   Army spokesmen said the rescue of the Shiite family occurred in
Kfar Kela village near the site of last week's car bombing.
   Six men from Yasser Arafat's Fatah guerrilas and a 13-year-old
girl seized a house belonging to a seven-member family, the army
said. Israeli reports said the guerrillas planned to rest in the
house before attempting a raid into Israel.
   The father of the family, a member of the South Lebanon Army,
escaped and an SLA batallion and an Israeli army unit backed by two
helicopter gunships surrounded the village, the army said.
   One guerrilla was wounded during 15 minutes of shooting and all
seven surrendered about 9:30 a.m.
   A Fatah communique issued in Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, said the guerrillas were five Palestinians and two Shiites
led by a 17-year-old Palestinian girl named Kifah Afifi.
   It reported a battle with an Israeli patrol but said nothing of
a Shiite family being taken hostage.
   Sources in south Lebanon said the guerrillas heading for the
Misgav Am border kibbutz, where Palestinian guerrillas seized
hostages in 1980. Three Israelis and five guerrillas were killed in
a gunbattle at that time.

   A prosecution witness described
how one victim's near-nude body was found just west of town as a
preliminary hearing opened Monday against a man linked by
authorites to the ``I-5 Strangler'' killings.
   El Dorado County sheriff's Detective Jim Watson also testified
in the hearing for Roger Reece Kibbe that the victim, Darcie
Frackenpohl, 17, had been strangled.
   The body of the victim, a runaway from Seattle, was discovered
by a jogger in September 1987 two to three weeks after she was
killed.
   Kibbe, 49, a former furniture maker and brother of a law
enforcement officer in the area, was arrested last April for
investigation of the murder of Ms. Frackenpohl.
   Sacramento County Sheriff Glen Craig has described Kibbe as a
suspect in the other six murders believed part of the ``I-5
Strangler'' series, although no other charges have been filed in
those cases.
   The killings occurred between April 1986 and last May in the
Sacramento and Stockton areas along Interstate 5 and south of Reno,
Nev.
   Eighteen witnesses are scheduled to be called during the
four-day preliminary hearing to determine whether Kibbe should be
bound over for trial.
   Watson said a search of the area just off U.S. 50 below Echo
Summit also turned up two packaged condoms, a black high-heeled
shoe and the victim's pink dress, found about 1,000 feet from the
body.
   Also called as a witness was a 17-year-old woman who said she
had worked as a prostitute with the victim in West Sacramento. The
witness also identified the victim's pink dress.
   When the preliminary hearing opened, Municipal Court Judge
Eugene Rasmussen renewed his earlier ruling that no still or
television cameras would be allowed during the session.
   Last June, the judge had declined to allow cameras but rejected
a defense motion to close the hearing.
   The closure had been opposed by media representatives who said
that in other alleged serial murder cases courts have held that
public access is too important to bar reporters.
   Defense attorney Phil Kohn had argued Kibbe couldn't get a fair
trial and expressed concern about news accounts that tended to link
Kibbe to the other six murders.
   Kibbe was ordered to appear in a police lineup late this summer
and, as a result, prosecutors said investigations in at least one
of the other murders were underway even though no other charges
have been filed.
   Prosecutors have said the other jurisdictions are all following
the El Dorado County proceeding to see if it will assist in their
cases.

<HEAD>Gov. Thompson Puts Off Decision on Dotson For Several Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson said Monday he'll withhold
a decision on whether to pardon convicted rapist Gary Dotson until
he can determine the scientific reliability of a test that cleared
Dotson of the 1977 attack.
   The Illinois Prisoner Review Board was unanimous in recommending
the pardon, Thompson said.
   Dotson was convicted of raping Cathy Crowell Webb and was
sentenced to serve a 25- to 50-year prison term. Thompson in 1985
commuted the sentence to time served after Mrs. Webb recanted her
testimony.
   The governor said at the time he did not pardon Doston because
he did not believe Mrs. Webb's recantation. But Thompson also said
Dotson's time in prison equalled that of other convicted rapists,
and called the release a gesture of mercy.
   Dotson's attorney, Thomas Breen, contends Dotson deserves a
``full and complete pardon'' after the most recent test, a kind of
genetic fingerprinting performed by a California firm, exonerated
Dotson.

<HEAD>Administration Disappointed With Senate Refusal To Fund Angola
Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration told the Senate that its
refusal to allocate funds for a possible U.N. peacekeeping force in
southern Africa may delay the pullout of 50,000 Cuban troops from
Angola, it was disclosed Monday.
   The administration had sought permission from Congress to
transfer $150 million from a foreign aid account to a special fund
for peacekeeping operations. But the Senate balked in the final
hours of the 100th Congress, despite assurances Friday from
National Security Adviser Colin Powell that the United States would
not abandon Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   The money was specifically intended to cover the U.S. share in
start-up costs of a 7,500-member U.N. force that would supervise a
Cuban pullout from Angola and independence for neighboring
Southwestern Africa, known as Namibia.
   Negotiations are at a stalemate over the timetable for a Cuban
pullout, but the administration is hoping for a breakthrough that
could come while Congress is in recess. The 100th Congress
adjourned on Saturday and the 101st will not be sworn in until
January.
   ``So naturally, we're disappointed'' that the money for the
peacekeeping force wasn't approved, State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said. ``We were hopeful that Congress would have
authorized this transfer, given the importance to the United States
of ongoing peacekeeping efforts in several regions of the world.''
   Senate approval was blocked by supporters of Savimbi, whose
UNITA organization has been receiving U.S. help in its fight
against the leftist Angolan government.
   The senators wanted assurances that Savimbi's future would be
included in any package worked out between Angola, South Africa and
Cuba, with the mediation of the United States.
   Seeking to assuage those concerns, Powell wrote Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., on Friday assuring him the United States would
not abandon Savimbi until the Angolan government includes him in a
political settlement.
   U.S. support for ``the valiant UNITA ... has not and been and
will not be a bargaining chip in the negotiations for Cuban troop
withdrawal'' from Angola, Powell wrote.
   He urged DeConcini and his colleagues to approve funding for the
peacekeeping force. ``If there are insufficient funds ... Cuban
troop withdrawal will be delayed,'' he added.
   DeConcini dropped his objections to the administration's request
after reading Powell's Oct. 21 letter, but other opponents were not
swayed, an aide to the senator said.
   Angola has rejected U.S. urgings to discuss UNITA's role in a
settlement, saying the matter is an internal affair.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Injunction Against English Language Referendum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday refused to bar from the Nov.
8 ballot a referendum to declare English the state's official
language.
   The ruling clears the way for Florida to join Arizona and
Colorado in posing ``Official English'' ballot questions to voters.
   U.S. District Judge James Kehoe refused to grant an injunction
sought by opponents of the measure, saying the citizens' initiative
did not violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
   A spokeswoman for Florida English, which sponsored the
initiative, called the ruling ``a great relief,'' but its opponents
said an appeal was certain.
   A class action with four Spanish-speaking residents of Dade
County as the named plaintiffs was filed against the ballot
proposal, known as Amendment 11. It contended that the proposal
violated the federal Voting Rights Acts because the petitions
seeking to put it on the ballot were circulated only in English.
   ``The state's involvement in the petition process does not
amount to state action triggering application of the Voting Rights
Act,'' Kehoe said in a seven-page ruling.
   ``While a petition initiative in Florida is subject to state
approval, such approval must be granted so long as certain format
requirements have been adhered to,'' the judge ruled.
   Under a provision of the Voting Rights Act, election literature
must be distributed in a second language in areas where more than 5
percent of the population has limited knowledge of English. That
would include Dade and five other counties _ Collier, Dade, Hardee,
Hendry, Hillsborough and Monroe.
   The suit was based on a Colorado suit that persuaded a federal
judge in Denver last month to invalidate thousands of signatures in
areas of Colorado where petitions for a constitutional amendment
making English that state's official language were not circulated
in Spanish.
   But one day after the Florida suit was filed, an appeals court
in Denver overturned the lower court decision.
   Kehoe noted in his final paragraph: ``The court stresses that
this decision in no way represents a judgment as to the merits of
the constitutional amendment at issue. Rather, the present ruling
is limited to the narrow question of whether the petition to place
the proposed amendment on the election ballot is subject to the
language minority requirements of the Voting Rights Act.''
   ``We were a private group, not a government agency,'' said Pat
Fulton, a spokeswoman for Florida English. ``It was really
stretching federal law'' to try to apply the Voting Rights Act.
   The suit's plaintiffs were backed by an organization named Speak
Up Now For Florida.
   ``My inclination is to appeal,'' said Donald Middlebrooks, an
attorney for the plaintiffs. ``I think the amendment is divisive to
the community. ... It is looked upon as anti-Hispanic.''
   Jeff Browne, statewide coordinator for Speak Up Now For Florida,
said there were excellent grounds for an appeal and that he was
certain one would be filed.
   ``We thought that at the trial court there was a very good
chance it would go against us, so we're well-prepared for that,''
he said by telephone from his Washington office.

   In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.
   Commenting on news agency dispatches about the presence of a

us to emphasize the following:
   1. What has been said about the presence of a photograph of
captive Anderson is sheer fabrication and is absolutely devoid of
truth.
   2. We demand that Italian authorities pubish the picture of
Anderson to reveal the truth. Otherwise we hold Italian authorities
fully responsible for collaborating in a malicious conspiracy aimed
at besmirching our image in the eyes of public opinion. This will
not go unpunished.
   3. The political links of the so-called Aline Rizkallah to
Israeli secret agents and her drug trading or taking is clear proof
that needs no corroboration of her uninvolvement in any matter
related to us whatsoever.
   4. We are awaiting the Italian response so that we understand
the truth of the matter and take the appropriate stand.

<TEXT>
   Meredith S. Buel, a special assistant to the
chairman of the National Mediation Board and former reporter and
editor for the Washington Evening Star, died here Monday of cancer.
He was 65.
   Buel had been with the Mediation Board, which regulates labor
relations in the railroad and airline industries, as its chief
spokesman for 10 years. Prior to that he was public relations
director for the American Institute of Merchant Shipping.
   He had been a reporter and editor for the now-defunct Washington

<HEAD>Conservation Planning For Erodible Lands Passes Halfway Mark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservation planning to protect highly
erodible land has passed the halfway mark, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said plans have been completed for 75.3 million acres, or
53 percent of the estimated 143 million acres of cropland needing
plans.
   The conservation planning was required by Congress in the 1985
farm law, and Scaling said the agency's goal is to have 65 percent
of the plans completed by the end of 1988 and the remainder by the
end of 1989.
   ``We are right on target, but I urge farmers to act now if they
have highly erodible land that needs a conservation plan,'' he said.
   To remain eligible for USDA programs _ including crop price
supports and other benefits _ farmers and ranchers who operate
highly erodible cropland must have a conservation plan approved by
Dec. 31, 1989. And they will have until the end of 1994 to put the
plan into operation. To date, conservation plans have been
implemented on 21.7 million acres, or 15 percent.
   The following shows progress as of Oct. 1, by states. The first
column shows the estimated number of acres of highly erodible land,
and the second is the percentage of acres for which plans have been
completed.

<HEAD>New Rules Set For Walking Horses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New interim rules restricting the use of pads
and other devices to train Tennessee Walking Horses and other
gaited horses will take effect immediately to close a loophole in
previously issued regulations, the Agriculture Department announced
Monday.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the new rules will continue
the present ban on the use of heel pads of more than one inch in
yearling horses.
   In a previous interim rule announced on July 26, the agency
eliminated federal regulations that phased down the maximum pad
height to one inch. In place of that, the agency ruled that pad
height would be based on the length of a horse's natural foot.
   Glosser said that under the July provisions the pad height on
some horses may exceed one inch, and that this could be injurious
to yearlings. He said the agency ``inadvertently retained language
from the earlier rule that would have ended the limitation on pad
height for yearling horses after Oct. 31.''
   He said a limit on the height of heel pads used on yearlings
``is necessary because the immature development of the young
horses' limbs makes higher pads potentially harmful to them.''
Therefore, Glosser said, the agency ``is removing the language in
the regulations that would have terminated this restriction after
Oct. 31.''
   The USDA agency administers the Horse Protection Act of 1970,
which prohibits the practice of ``soring'' horses by using cruel
methods, devices or chemicals to cause them pain when walking.
Soring is done primarily to alter a horse's gait for the show ring.

<HEAD>Pilot Blamed For Ramstein Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilot error caused the fiery collision
of three Italian jets that killed 69 people at the U.S. Ramstein
Air Base during an exhibition Aug. 28, an inquiry commission said
Monday.
   One of the 10 jets in the show plunged into a crowd of about
300,000 people and exploded in flames after colliding with two of
the planes. All three pilots were among the dead.
   The report issued by the West German Defense Ministry said the
collision occurred when one of the pilots tried to fly through a
formation made by the other planes.
   The complex low-altitude maneuvers such as the one attempted in
Ramstein involve two groups of four and five planes each. The two
groups fly past each other in opposite directions and then climb in
single file in two finishing loops. The 10th plane, the soloist,
flies through the formation at a 90-degree angle.
   The report did not say what specific error or errors caused the
collision.
   ``The cause of the midair collision between the solo pilot and
two other planes from the Italian stunt flying team ... has been
determined to have been human error by the solo pilot,'' the report
said.
   The solo pilot was Lt. Col. Ivo Nutarelli, 38, an experienced
flyer who had logged 4,250 hours of flying before the accident.
   Two days after the crash, Lt. Col. Diego Raineri, the commander
of the stunt-flying team who was coordinating the team's manuevers
from the ground by radio, said the solo plane entered the formation
too low and too soon.
   The commmission, led by West German military flight safety
authorities and including U.S. and Italian experts, ruled out other
possible causes of the disaster such as technical failure or
collision with a flock of birds.
   ``The commission has determined that there was no violation of
safety regulations for air shows that are binding for NATO member
states,'' the report said. ``The organizer had fulfilled
corresponding safety requirements and in part had even increased
them.''
   However, the commission recommended that North Atlantic Treaty
Organization member states make a ``critical reassessment of air
shows in light of this tragic accident.''

<HEAD>Environmental Group Files New Challenge of Nuclear Simulation
Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An environmental group and a North Carolina
regional planning commission filed suit against the Navy and
Defense Department on Monday, attempting to stop further testing of
a high-powered electrical generator that simulates one of the
effects of a nuclear blast.
   The suit, which requests preliminary and permanent injunctions,
accuses the Navy of starting tests of the Empress II generator off
the North Carolina coast this summer on the basis of a ``hopelessly
premature and flawed'' environmental impact statement.
   It accuses the Navy of ignoring potential adverse effects on
test workers and recreational or commercial boaters and fishermen,
as well as on marine life and the radio equipment of passing ships
and planes.
   ``Empress II poses a grave potential risk to the environment and
public health and we intend to shut it down until the Navy conforms
with federal laws governing environmental safety,'' said Jeremy
Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, an activist
environmental group based in Washington.
   The foundation filed suit in U.S. District Court here with the
Albemarle Commission, a regional planning and development
commission based in Hertford, N.C., that represents 24 local North
Carolina governments, including Currituck County.
   The Navy's initial testing of Empress II occurred this summer in
the waters of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Currituck County,
just south of the Virginia Capes near the Virginia-North Carolina
border.
   ``The radiation emitted by Empress II presents hazards to the
well-being of marine life and of human beings exposed to it,
including sailors, fishermen, tourists and others in the area
subjected to such radiation,'' the 19-page lawsuit asserts.
   The Navy declined immediate comment on the suit. Lt. Cmdr. Craig
Quigley, a Navy spokesman, said initial Empress II testing had been
completed for the year and would not resume until next summer.
   Empress II is a Navy barge that has been fitted with two diesel
generators and a huge spread of antennas. The equipment is capable
of sending ``pulses'' of electrical power into the atmosphere at
power levels up to 7 million volts to test a phenomenon known as
electro-magnetic pulse, or EMP.
   Each pulse lasts only a billionth of a second, and the Navy
maintains the testing will have no effect on human or marine life.
   Electro-magnetic pulse is a powerful wave, or surge, of
electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which
can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water.
   EMP became a matter of concern to the military in the early
1960s when the Pentagon discovered a nuclear bomb detonated at high
altitudes could generate a pulse so strong it could disable the
electronic components used in computers, communications and
guidance equipment.
   As a result of that discovery, military laboratories have
studied the phenomenon for 25 years in the course of developing
methods for ``hardening'' electronic weapon components to withstand
EMP. The Navy wants to use the Empress II barge to test its success
in hardening electronic equipment on its warships.
   The foundation sued the Defense Department in March 1987 with
the goal of stopping all EMP testing until environmental impact
studies had been performed.
   Earlier this year, the Pentagon agreed to settle that lawsuit by
sharply curtailing or shutting down EMP research facilities across
the country until environmental assessments were performed. In the
case of Empress II, however, the Navy argued it already had
performed the necessary environmental study and thus could proceed
with testing.

<BYLINE>Kidnapping, Murder Trial of Nancy Rish Begins
^By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman charged with kidnapping a
businessman and helping bury him alive in a failed attempt to get
$1 million in ransom is the victim of mistaken identity, an
attorney said Monday.
   It was another woman _ not Nancy Rish _ who took part in the
abduction of Stephen Small, who was placed in a wooden box equipped
with a makeshift air system before being buried, defense attorney
Sherri Carr told the jury.
   But prosecutor Michael Ficaro said Rish was willing to help her
boyfriend kidnap Small, the great-grandson of a former Illinois
governor, because she wanted to share in ``the $1 million jackpot.''
   Small, 40, was abducted from his home in September 1987. He
suffocated when the air pipe in the box failed.
   Rish, 26, is charged with murder and kidnapping. Daniel Edwards,
31, her roommate, was convicted of the same charges in May and
sentenced to die.
   ``The burying of Stephen Small alive was what they were willing
to do for $1 million ... that ticket to easy street ... life in the
fast-lane,'' said Ficaro. ``The murder was a result of a cold,
callous, calculating plan of Nancy Rish and Danny Edwards for the
big score, the $1 million jackpot.''
   But Ms. Carr called the case ``a whodunnit'' and said the
defense would identify the woman who really helped Edwards carry
out the kidnapping.
   ``They would like you to believe this mystery is solved,'' she
said. ``The mystery is why this young woman (Ms. Rish) is sitting
before you today.''
   Fingerprints and hair samples taken in the case did not match
those taken from Rish, and soil samples from the remote grave site,
between Kankakee and the Indiana border, did not match soil on any
of Ms. Rish's shoes, Ms. Carr said.
   Ficaro told jurors they would hear a chilling tape recording of
Small's ``voice from the grave,'' pleading with his wife, Nancy, to
raise the $1 million ransom.
   The jury for Rish's trial was selected in Rockford because of
extensive news coverage of the case. The jury will be sequestered
during the trial.

   Striking railroad workers
paralyzed train service and stranded tens of thousands of commuters
Monday to try to win wage increases and regain buying power lost to
inflation.
   Unions representing mailmen, teachers, doctors and other
employees among the estimated 1 million Argentines who work for the
state have staged, or are planning, similar walkouts in what has
become a major challenge to the government's anti-inflation program.
   President Raul Alfonsin said last week the government will try
to keep wage increases for state employees at 4 percent a month in
November and December, except in the industries where productivity
is increased. Private companies were urged to follow the same
guideline.
   Inflation for October is projected at 8 percent. Unions are
demanding wage increases of at least as much to keep pace with the
inflation rate, which was 25 percent in July, 27 percent in August
and 12 percent in September.
   Unions representing the railroad workers are demanding wage
increases of 39 percent for October.
   Postal workers went on strike on Monday and Tuesday last week,
and have called another nationwide strike for Wednesday. Mail
deliveries also were interrupted Friday and again this week.
   Flights of the national airlines, Aerolineas Argentinas, were
disrupted Friday by striking pilots, ground crew and other
personnel, who are planning further work stoppages.
   The 30,000 employees of the state oil company Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales threatened to strike last week, but agreed to
accept 4 percent raises in November and December after the
government reduced the work day from eight hours to seven hours.
   Teachers in the Buenos Aires district won 15 percent pay raises
for October, but doctors at 150 public hospitals and court clerks
across the nation are to go on strike Wednesday.
   The country's biggest labor federation, the General Labor
Confederation, is demanding that the minimum wage of about $87 be
drastically increased.
   Carlos Menem, the opposition Peronist Party's candidate for
president in the national elections set for May, estimated last
week that workers' buying power has shrunk by 30 percent since
Alfonsin took office in December 1983.
   Since January 1984, inflation has soared by 49,466 percent and
the gross national product has remained stagnant for five years at
about $76 billion. Alfonsin's government has imposed wage and price
controls, currency devaluations and budget cutbacks in an
unsuccessful effort to curtail increases in the cost of living.
   The economy is the main issue in the political campaign and
Menem has promised pay raises and tax cuts if he is elected
president.
   Eduardo Angeloz, the presidential candidate of Alfonsin's
centrist Radical Civic Union, is depending on the government's
anti-inflation plan to take hold.
   Argentines will have to endure a ``clenched teeth struggle,''
Angeloz said in a campaign speech last week. Once the economy has
been reorganized by selling off state companies and boosting
exports, ``Argentina will finally recover its rightful place in the
world.''
   In a poll published by the newspaper La Nacion last week, twice
as many voters support Menem as Angeloz.

<TEXT>
   Investigators have narrowed to four the
list of suspects in the strangling of a 16-year-old church organist
who was abducted from the sanctuary where she was cleaning up for
services, police said Monday.
   One, an 18-year-old high school student, was interrogated for
about three hours Saturday night before police released him, Police
Chief Grover Smith said.
   ``We haven't eliminated him yet, but there was not enough
evidence to arrest him,'' he said, describing the case against the
student as ``very circumstantial.''
   Police have no idea why Stephanie King, a well-known teen-ager
in the southern Alabama city, was killed. Her body was found
Saturday afternoon in her car, which was parked in a wooded area
about four miles from Alco Baptist Church.
   But Smith said he thinks the girl was slain in a crime of
opportunity.
   ``He (the killer) just went over there (to the church), saw her
by herself and took advantage of the situation,'' the chief said.
   ``She wouldn't have had enough money to justify robbery, and
there was no indication of any (sexual) assault,'' he added.
   Smith said authorities ``believe this person forced her to drive
out where we found her. And the assault took place in the car,
apparently.''
   About 10:45 a.m. Saturday, Miss King had telephoned the Rev.
Bobby Rone from the church to tell him that someone there wanted to
talk to him, Smith said.
   Rone spoke to the unidentified person over the telephone and
answered his question about when the church office would be open,
Smith said.
   The pastor became concerned about the call because Miss King was
at the church alone. He went there and, not finding the girl,
contacted her family to see if she was home.
   Police do not know whether the caller was the killer.
   ``She was cleaning up the church, she had a part-time job
there,'' Smith said. He declined to comment about the position of
the body in the car or whether it appeared she might have known her
assailant.
   ``I'd rather not get into that,'' he said.
   Miss King was a senior honor student at T.R. Miller High School
and played with the school band, in addition to performing as the
church organist.

   Dell Publishing is ready to print the biography
of the 41st president of the United States _ whoever he may be.
   The publishing house has prepared biographies, intended for an
audience of children, of both Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
and Vice President George Bush, and is now waiting for the election
to write the final chapter.
   ``That task will be completed on Nov. 9. Needless to say, there

Michelle Poploff, executive editor at Dell.
   The book is to be published shortly before Inauguration Day, and
will concentrate on the winner's childhood years.
   Biographers Mark Sufrin and Lynn Beach started following the
field of candidates last spring and got down to serious research
and writing when the nominees were selected.
   Two nearly identical covers have already been printed, each
bearing a color photograph of the man. The oath of office is
printed on each cover, with the appropriate name inserted.
   The loser's biography is targeted for the ash heap of history.
   ``There can be only one president of the United States and only
one presidential biography,'' said Poploff. ``May the best

<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Monday
authorizing the Pentagon to close unneeded military bases as the
White House began poring over mounds of bills passed by Congress in
its waning days.
   Reagan, who often has complained about what he sees as
pork-barrel spending on Capitol Hill, kept his approval of the
base-closing legislation low-key. The president's approval of the
bill, passed overwhelmingly by both the House and Senate, was
merely noted in a White House press office statement listing an
assortment of bills he signed.
   Among the other pieces of legislation that Reagan signed were
one requiring the secretary of agriculture to set up a 10-year
program to study the effects of air pollutants on forest ecology.
He approved a bill extending temporary authority to pay overtime to
federal employees fighting forest fires and another one
establishing a new Technology Administration within the Commerce
Department.
   Reagan is scheduled to sign legislation Tuesday morning creating
a new Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs. The president
will sign the legislation at the conclusion of a speech to the
National Defense University at Fort McNair in the District of
Columbia, the White House said.
   The bill giving the Defense Department authorization to close
bases has been estimated to have the potential of saving the
government up to $5 billion a year as Pentagon officials pare down
the list of 3,800 U.S. military installations.
   The Senate approved the bill 82-7 and the House followed shortly
afterward with a 370-31 vote.
   The bill sets up a complicated base-closing procedure which
essentially cuts through the thicket of laws enacted by Congress in
the past decade to thwart Pentagon efforts to shut down bases.
   It also endorses a Pentagon-appointed commission which has been
meeting for months, trying to put together a list of bases to be
closed. The current panel will be expanded to 12 members by the
bill.
   The panel will make its recommendations by Dec. 31. Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci would have until Jan. 15 _ five days
before he leaves office _ to either accept or reject the entire
list. He could not change the list.
   If Carlucci approves the list, Congress would have until
mid-April to overturn the proposal, but it could only do that by
approving a resolution which could then be vetoed by the incoming
president.
   No base closures would begin before 1990.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that some
120 pieces of legislation had been received at the White House, and
that he expected action on many of them within the next few days.
Congress adjourned early Saturday.
   ``Out of 120 bills, some of them are going to be vetoed, yes,''
Fitzwater said. ``But I don't know which ones.''
   The spokesman said, for example, that while the White House has
signaled its general support for a bill making technical
corrections in the 1986 law overhauling the U.S. tax code, ``we
have major problems'' with some aspects of the legislation.
   Reagan is expected to sign legislation immediately authorizing
$500 million in new spending on the effort to combat drug
trafficking.
   The president's approval was virtually assured when the Senate
kept intact a House provision allowing for the death penalty for
certain crimes committed in the commission of drug trafficking.
   During his daily news briefing, Fitzwater called the 100th
Congress ``very productive'' and said ``we are extraordinarily
pleased that so many parts of the president's agenda have been
enacted into law in this Congress.''
   ``You all know the criticism that a lame duck president can't do
anything,'' he told reporters.
   He cited the timely passage of 13 appropriations bills financing
government operations in the new budget year, along with passage of
welfare reform, catastrophic illness and drug abuse legislation.

   President Reagan turned seven shovelsful of
dirt Monday as he helped transplant a willow oak from Maryland on
the South Lawn of the White House as part of a program started by
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.
   After the fourth shovelful, Reagan said, ``I may stay here.''
   After the seventh, a reporter asked him how long he thought it
would take to turn over the entire pile of dirt that had been
heaped up beside the 18-foot tall tree.
   ``It would seem as long as a press conference,'' he said.
Presidential press conferences usually last half an hour.
   ``I think I'll leave it to someone else,'' the president said.
   The tree, which is 14 years old, was grown at Angelica Nursery
in Kennedyville, on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
   It is a gift from the American Association of Nurserymen, which
formed a committee in 1979 to evaluate and maintain the White House
gardens and grounds.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the tree was planted
as part of a landscape plan commissioned by FDR three years after
he took office.
   The nurserymen's group also donated a sugar maple tree that
Reagan planted in 1984 just north of the West Wing.
   ``It is alive and flourishing,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>NLRB Judge Rules In Favor of Union; Accuses Harvard of
Misrepresentations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A National Labor Relations Board judge on
Monday overruled Harvard University's objection to a union election
in May, accusing the university of misrepresenting both the union's
conduct and labor law.
   In a harshly worded opinion, NLRB Administrative Law Judge Joel
A. Harmatz certified the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical
Workers as the winner in the election to unionize Harvard's 3,400
technical and clerical workers.
   The union, an affiliate of the 1 million-member American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, won the
election on a 1,530-1,486 vote characterized by a 90 percent
turnout among those eligible.
   Harmatz dismissed as unfounded Harvard's complaints that the
union illegally coerced ``yes'' votes through a coordinated
campaign to assure that union supporters cast ballots.
   Harvard's brief in the case, Harmatz said, ``is replete with
misinterpretations of the record'' of eight days of hearings the
NLRB held in August on the university's charges.
   ``Because these references either are not supported by, or
grossly overstate the proven facts, this decision seeks to, at this
level, bring a halt to this approach,'' the judge said.
   He further chastised Harvard, saying, ``Additional delay has
been occasioned by the employer's proclivity to disguise as fact
argumentative and sometimes frivolous interpretations'' of the
evidence in the case.
   The union drive, which began in 1975, and the university's
challenge had been viewed by several labor leaders as a major test
of their ability to organize new cadres of educated, white- and
gray-collar technical workers assuming a greater proportion of the
workforce.
   Harvard spokeswoman Marjorie Heffron said no decision has been
made on whether to appeal Harmatz's ruling to the full five-member
board. Under the law, it has two weeks to file an appeal.
   ``The university's position is sound, and the union acted
improperly,'' Harvard Vice President for Finance Robert Scott said
in a prepared statement, ``It is plain that the opinion (by
Harmatz) does not accurately reflect the record of the hearings in
many respects.''
   AFSCME President Gerald McEntee said Monday that the election,
and the NLRB action upholding the results, was crucial for AFSCME
and as ``a test case for the labor movement as a whole.''
   ``The issues raised in this campaign were the issues that affect
the workforce of today and tomorrow _ job and family issues that
include affordable, quality child care, decent pensions and
benefits and flexibility in hours of work,'' he said.
   Among other things, Harvard had accused the union of coercing
``yes'' votes by offering transportation to voting places and
maintaining lists of union supporters to assure that they cast
ballots.
   The university also claimed that a practice in which union
sympathizers often accompanied some of the voting workers to the
polls and the placing of pro-union balloons, banners and posters
around the campus but not in the polling places themselves also
amounted to coercion.
   ``Stripped of glossy unconfirmed characterization, the
employer's complaint here addresses a perfectly legitimate,
apparently successful, tactical maneuver by the union which was
calculated to convert pre-election support into `yes' votes to the
greatest extent possible,'' Harmatz said.

   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., at 88 the oldest
member of Congress, was discharged from Walter Reed Army Hospital
on Monday after minor surgery, aides said.
   ``He is in very good condition for someone who has had a minor
surgical procedure,'' administrative assistant Frances Campbell
said.
   She said Pepper entered the hospital Thursday night and doctors
on Friday removed ``some scar tissue over where he had had a
hernia.''
   Doctors asked the House Rules Committee chairman to rest for the
remainder of the week, Campbell said.
   ``We're going to hold a meeting about the end of the week to see
if he goes back on the campaign trail Saturday, Sunday or Monday,''
she said.
   Pepper seemed to be in good spirits and chatted aimiably with
several reporters outside the hospital as he left, she said.

<HEAD>Iranian Rebels Claim Tehran Executes 300 More Dissidents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran recently has executed hundreds of
dissidents because it fears a ``popular backlash'' at home
following the Aug. 20 truce in its war with Iraq, the main Iranian
opposition movement claimed Monday.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said 250
political prisoners were executed in Rasht, a Caspian Sea town 140
miles northwest of Tehran. The group made the claim in a statement
sent by telex from its headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, to The
Associated Press in Nicosia.
   Scores more were executed in prisons in Tehran, the central city
of Isfahan and the northwestern city of Tabriz, the statement said.
   ``Hundreds of other prisoners have been executed en masse by
firing squads in prisons'' in the northeastern city of Mashhad, the
western city of Arak and a half dozen other towns in recent weeks,
it said.
   No independent confirmation was available of the Mujahedeen
report. The movement claimed last month that an estimated 1,200
political prisoners had been killed in Iran since midsummer.
   Iran's official news media, monitored in Cyprus, have reported
that scores of ``counter-revolutionaries and Iraqi spies'' were
executed by firing squad or publicly hanged in several cities over
the last two months.
   But the London-based human rights group, Amnesty International,
said indications surfaced that hundreds of Iranian political
prisoners have been executed since July.
   Mujahedeen leader Masoud Rajavi appealed to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar Aug. 26 to help pressure
Iran to halt what Rajavi called ``the accelerated pace of killings
in Iran'' amid mass roundups of suspected dissidents.
   Western correspondents reported after recent visits to Tehran
that many executed prisoners were buried in mass graves.
   Amnesty said authorities banned families from visiting political
prisoners.
   The U.S. House of Representatives last week approved a
resolution declaring June 20 a national day of remembrance for
political prisoners held in Iran.
   The reported wave of executions accelerated after the
Mujahedeen's military force, the National Liberation Army of Iran,
pushed into western Iran before the Aug. 20 cease-fire took effect
and reportedly captured two major towns before withdrawing after
fierce fighting.
   The Mujahedeen said hundreds of Iranians who welcomed their
fighters were later publicly hanged. Some Iranian leaders,
including Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili, publicly demanded
executing Liberation Army prisoners without trial.
   The Liberation Army has had to halt its military operations into
western Iran under the truce.
   But Mujahedeen officials have said that with political rifts
deepened within the Tehran hierarchy by the cease-fire, the
government fears the dissidents will pose a growing threat.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anyonmity, have
reported that despite political uncertainties triggered by Iran's
sudden collapse in the war after a string of major military
defeats, no major threat to the Tehran government is apparent.
   But internal divisions within the leadership showed clear signs
of widening in recent months over the economy and over efforts by
some pragmatic leaders, led by House Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, to
end Iran's political isolation.
   The Mujahedeen were allied with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in
his Islamic revolution that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in
1979. But Rajavi and his supporters fled to France after the
fundamentalists turned on their erstwhile liberal and leftist
allies in bloody purges in 1980.
   Rajavi moved to Iran two years ago after Iran pressured France
to expel anti-Khomeini dissidents.

   Soviet icebreakers, trying to help rescue two
whales off Barrow, Alaska, also were involved in a whale rescue off
Eastern Siberia three years ago, an American official involved in
joint U.S.-Soviet ocean research said Monday.
   In 1985, Soviet icebreakers broke through an ice barrier in the
Gulf of Anadyr trying to free several dozen beluga whales, said
Robert V. Miller, deputy director of the National Marine Laboratory
in Seattle.
   ``Reports are mixed, but I think they did get some out,'' Miller
said in a telephone interview.
   Unlike the Barrow whales, trapped under the ice, the Anadyr
whales were in a small area of water that was cut off from the
ocean by a ring of ice. Icebreakers had to break through the ring.
Belugas are smaller than the California gray whales off Barrow,
typically 15 feet long compared with 50 feet.
   Miller said he did not know whether the Soviet vessels involved
in the Barrow attempt were also involved at Anadyr.
   The Gulf of Anadyr is in the western Bering Sea south of the
Chukchi peninsula, the easternmost portion of Siberia.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have been cooperating on
whale and other marine mammal research in the northern Pacific,
Bering Sea and Arctic Oceans since 1973 under the U.S.-Soviet
treaty on environmental protection.
   They have conducted at least 15 joint research cruises, and
scientists from the two countries visit each other's laboratories
about twice a year, Miller said.
   Though the icebreakers at Barrow were not part of the research
agreement, the willingness of the Soviet Union to lend a hand shows
that its scientists are ``very much interested in marine mammals
and conservation of these animals,'' Miller said.

<HEAD>American Group May Have Been Intended Recipient of Hostage-related

<TEXT>
   An investigator said Monday that an American
group may have been the intended recipient of photographs of U.S.
hostages found in the suitcase of a Lebanese airline passenger.
   Photograhps of American hostages Terry Anderson and Alann Steen,
along with a letter bearing Steen's name and a third photo, were
found last Thursday in the luggage of a woman passenger from Beirut
at Milan's Linate airport.
   Police said the Lebanese woman, who was arrested, was to deliver
the photos and documents to Aldo Anghessa, an Italian arms trader
with known links to the Italian and Swiss secret services.
   ``We know the group that shipped them (documents and pictures)
and we identified the man who delivered the material to the
Lebanese woman,'' said Achille Serra, head of Milan's
anti-terrorist police.
   ``Anghessa acted as a go-between, between the two groups,'' he
added. ``One party was a Lebanese organization. We have identified
the final destination. We cannot tell you about the latter.''
   Pressed about the final destination, Serra said: ``You know an
American organization is interested in getting this material. You
have the experience to understand which one.''
   Later Monday Serra said he had not suggested the U.S. government
was to receive the pictures and documents, and insisted he had been
speculating earlier and was not giving an official conclusion.
   Police identified the woman as Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36. In
Beirut, the Islamic Jihad group that holds Anderson said she was
not a member of its organization.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Anghessa had no connection to the U.S. government and American
officials did not know what he intended to do with the documents.
   Redman said the United States believes those who act without
U.S. government authorization to try to free the hostages in
Lebanon ``should butt out.''
   He also said the affair might be a fraud and that the
photographs did not appear to be originals.
   President Reagan was asked at a White House tree planting
ceremony whether anyone from the United States government was
dealing with the Iranians about the hostages and said, ``Not to my
knowledge,'' adding, ``They wouldn't be doing it without my
knowledge.''
   The picture of Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for
the Associated Press, appeared similar _ in reverse image _ to a
black and white photograph of Anderson released in Beirut on Aug.
18.
   The man in the third photograph initially had been identified as
American hostage Thomas Sutherland, but police later said it was
not him.
   Ms. Rizkallah was jailed in Milan after police also found she
was carrying $1,000 in counterfeit U.S. bills and 1.7 ounces of
heroin.
   Anghessa has been interrogated but not arrested and there is no
evidence he had commited a crime, police said.
   The Rome-based newspaper Il Messaggero quoted Anghessa as saying
he knew nothing about Ms. Rizkallah or her parcels and he was
willing to cooperate with investigators.
   Islamic Jihad, in an Arabic-language statement distributed in
Lebanon, said Ms. Rizkallah was not involved ``in any matter
related to us whatsoever'' and claimed she had links with Israel's
secret service. It called the photograph of Anderson ``sheer
fabrication.''
   Anderson, 40, was kidnapped in Beirut March 16, 1985, and is the
longest held of the 14 foreigners, including nine American, missing
and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon.
   Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., was acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut when he was
abducted June 9, 1985.
   Steen, 49, of Boston, a professor at Beirut University College,
was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation
of Palestine.

   Oliver L. North's claim that he wasn't warned
that lying to Congress would result in criminal prosecution shows a
``shocking and cynical'' view of American government, Iran-Contra
prosecutors said Monday.
   The former presidential aide's argument that he cannot be
prosecuted for making false statements about aiding Nicaraguan
rebels is ``incompatible with the aspirations of our system of
government and, we believe, inconsistent with any but the most
jaundiced view of the realities of politics and government,''
prosecutors said in a reply to defense motions.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, meanwhile, consented to
the dismissal of one of the 16 counts against North, a former
National Security Council official and retired Marine lieutenant
colonel.
   Walsh said he did not oppose a defense motion to dismiss a
charge that North obstructed an FBI investigation into the
construction of a $13,800 security fence outside his suburban
Virginia home.
   North is accused of preparing false documents in December 1986
to hide the fact that arms dealer Richard V. Secord paid for the
fence. North, who claims he was the target of terrorist threats, is
also accused of illegally accepting the fence as a gratuity.
   Walsh did not dispute a defense contention that the alleged
fabrication wasn't an obstruction of justice because the grand jury
investigation did not begin until a month later.
   But the prosecution offered a spirited defense of charges that
North made false statements to congressional committees to obstruct
inquiries into reports that he was covertly helping raise money to
arm the Contras.
   ``In order to prevent congressional discovery of the
conspirators' covert activities, North engaged in a continuing
campaign of lies and deception,'' prosecutors said.
   Ridiculing North's defense, prosecutors said he was, in effect,
arguing that the false statements did not impede Congress ``because
no one could be so naive as to believe that a high government
official might be telling the truth.''
   North's rebuttal reflects ``a shocking and cynical view of the
relations between the people's elected representatives in Congress
and officials of the executive branch,'' prosecutors said.
   The false statements were made in 1985 after the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence and a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee inquired about news reports that North and others were
covertly helping arm the Contra rebels in violation of the
so-called Boland Amendment. That provision prohibited direct
military assistance to the rebels.
   ``North responded with calculated falsehood, intending to derail
further investigation and generally succeeding,'' prosecutors said
of charges that the former NSC aide drafted letters that falsely
denied his involvement in covert aid and fund-raising.
   The prosecution urged rejection of North's contention that he
did not receive ``fair warning that an executive branch official or
a member of his staff would be guilty of a crime if the truth were
misstated in an unsworn communication to Congress.''
   North's lawyers cited a litany of examples of lying by top
officials, including untruthful statements about the U-2 spy plane
and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles' false denial to Congress
of CIA support for a 1958 rebellion against Indonesian President
Sukarno.
   ``When a committee of Congress makes a formal request for
information from executive officers, deliberately false responses
intended to thwart the inquiry are not a privileged part of our
system, but criminal obstruction,'' Walsh said.
   North, also charged with lying at a 1986 briefing for the
intelligence panel, drafted false letters that were signed by
then-national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane to erect ``a
barrier of lies and misrepresentations that effectively aborted the
congressional inquiries.''
   McFarlane pleaded guilty last spring to four misdemeanor counts
of withholding information about North's activities from Congress
in the letters and in 1986 testimony.
   Walsh also disclosed some new details about North's destruction
of sensitive NSC documents when the Iran-Contra affair was
unraveling in 1986.
   The destroyed material included original copies of so-called
``System IV'' documents _ ``the most sensitive records in the NSC's
carefully constructed system of document control,'' prosecutors
said.
   North also purposely withheld from NSC files original copies of
documents, including memos and messages. The papers he kept in his
office included documents that were the ``sole record of the events
and activities described therein,'' prosecutors said.

   A coalition of religious groups on Monday
urged the leaders of Operation Rescue, the group responsible for
demonstrations blocking entrances to abortion clinics since July,
to ``repent.''
   ``Operation Rescue is an act of terrorism,'' Katherine Hancock
Ragsdale of the Episcopal Women's Caucus told a news conference.
``The illegal and immoral activities of Operation Rescue are a blot
on our nation's conscience.
   ``In the name of God, I call upon them to repent,'' she said.
   Ragsdale's views were shared by other representatives from some
of the 30 Jewish and Protestant religions that comprise the
Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights.
   ``Our organizations have gathered here today to announce that we
must _ and we will _ continue to defend our precious liberties,''
said Rabbi Jack Luxemburg of the American Jewish Congress.
   ``No group, no matter how many or how militant, will persuade us
to retreat to a time when women died from abortions obtained in
back alleys,'' he said.
   The coalition does not take issue with the New York-based
Operation Rescue's anti-abortion stance, but with the group's
methodology, which they said was a violation of a woman's
constitutional right to choose abortion, said coalition president
Faith Evans.
   ``They act as if there is a national debate about the right to a
woman to have an abortion, but there is not. That's been settled by
Roe versus Wade,'' Evans said of the landmark Supreme Court ruling.
   He noted that the coalition's Operation Respect would continue
to offer escort and counseling services for harassed clinic workers
and clients.
   Operation Rescue, which has called for nationwide demonstrations
on Oct. 29, attempts to prevent or dissuade women from having
abortions by blocking clinic entrances or by conducting sidewalk
counseling.
   More than 1,200 anti-abortion demonstrators have been arrested
and refused to accept bail since the protests began July 19 during
the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. All of the
protestors, including 300 arrested in a demonstration earlier this
month, have been released.
   ``Theirs is not the message of love, compassion and concern that
a Jesus of Nazareth would condone. Theirs is a message of lies, of
hate, of cruelty and punishment reflective of the witch burners and
torturers, disguised in the name of religion,'' said Natalie
Gulbrandson of the Unitarian Universalist Association.
   Coalition members criticized Operation Rescue's attempts to
align their actions with the ``civil disobedience'' of the civil
rights movement, and decried Operation Rescue's attempts to compare
abortion to the Holocaust of World War II.
   ``By comparing abortion to the Holocaust, the civil rights
movement and anti-slavery movement, they impugn the humanity of
millions of Jewish and black people, '' said the Rev. Theodore H.
Erickson of the United Church Board for Homeless Ministries of the
United Church of Christ.
   ``The main thing about the civil rights movement,'' said Mary
Jane Patterson of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), ``was that the
people we sat in against were breaking the law. Abortion is not
against the law.''

<TEXT>
   Four members of a Los Angeles-based youth
program pleaded innocent Monday to first-degree manslaughter
charges in the Oct. 14 beating death of an 8-year-old girl.
   Clackamas County Circuit Judge John Lowe scheduled a Dec. 12
trial for Willie K. Chambers, 35, of San Diego; Brian James
Brinson, 30; Constance Zipporah Jackson, 37; and Frederick Paul
Doolittle, 28, of Los Angeles.
   The death of the daughter of Eldridge Broussard Jr., leader of
the Watts Christian Center, led the state Children's Services
Division to remove 53 children from two homes the group operated in
Oregon. Two others are in custody in Los Angeles.
   On Oct. 14, four staff members took the body of Dayna Broussard
to a nearby fire station. She had been beaten and whipped, and died
of multiple blunt-  force injuries, authorties said.
   Juvenile authorities allege that the children were forced to
watch and keep count as adults, using paddles or electrical cords,
administered ritualistic beatings of up to 800 strokes to other
children.
   The beatings were intended to enhance athletic performance, not
to punish misbehavior, authorities have said.
   The four people who appeared in court Monday were jailed pending
a hearing Wednesday, said Deputy District Attorney Al French.

   More than 50,000 jubilant Dodger fans Monday
joined their World Series champs for a party in the streets,
savoring the improbability of it all during a mid-day parade that
had downtown awash in a sea of blue.
   Fans, some dangling from tree limbs outside City Hall, hooted,
hollered and applauded wildly as their triumphant Los Angeles
Dodgers were introduced.
   Announcer Vin Scully called the celebration ``a love-in.''
   ``How sweet it is,'' yelled pitcher Orel Hershiser, the World
Series Most Valuable Player who last Thursday struck out the final
Oakland batter to win the championship and chalk up his second fall
classic victory.
   Nearby, fans hoisted a banner reading: ``A's Flunked the Orel
Exam.''
   ``I want to thank the greatest team that any manager could ever
have,'' said Manager Tommy Lasorda. Moments later, he began
lurching back and forth in a unique twist-style dance step after
recalling his spring training prediction that, come October, he
would be dancing in the streets.
   The victory parade for baseball's unlikely champions mixed deja
vu and Dodger Blue for southern Californians accustomed to reigning
sports champs.
   The world champion Los Angeles Lakers basketball team was the
focus of attention five months ago, drawing 40,000 fans to a
similar parade. In college football, the UCLA Bruins are rated No.
1 in the nation.
   ``With all the championships we've had here, it was about time
we came to one of the parades,'' said Jose Rodriguez, 28, of
Bloomington.
   Approximately 30,000 fans gathered curbside along Broadway to
see the players pass on floats while another 20,000 were clustered
at City Hall, said police Lt. Fred Nixon.
   One of the police officers keeping order was Michael Strawberry,
older brother of New York Mets slugger Daryl Strawberry. He
conceded: ``It's kind of strange that I'm here on Dodger Day.''
   Marching bands also participated in the Dodger Day ceremony,
featured on five Los Angeles television stations.
   ``I'm the ultimate Dodger fan,'' said Ernesto Zepeda, 30, a
Hughes Aircraft worker from El Segundo who, along with his
3-year-old son Ernie Jr., were paradeside with faces painted Dodger
Blue.
   Other fans wore T-shirts hawked by vendors. Other wares included
Dodger horns, pennants, buttons and even blue cotton candy.
   The Dodger party was sweeter in light of the team's improbable
victory over the Oakland Athletics, a highly touted club of
sluggers that won 104 games in the regular season.
   The players Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley called ``the
Cinderella team of the 1988 series'' stole the championship from
the A's in five games.
   The highlights included a ninth inning home run by a hobbling
Kirk Gibson to clinch the first game; a 6-0 shutout by Hershiser in
the second; Mickey Hatcher's two-run homers in the first and fifth
games; and a complete game by Hershiser in the fifth for the title.
   And the party isn't over yet for the Dodgers. On Wednesday, the
blue crew is off to the White House for a reception with President
Reagan, who said during the series he was a Dodger fan.

<HEAD>Says Foreign Interference Harming Central American Peace Process</HEAD>

   Central America remains the exception to
worldwide peace trends and foreign aid to rebels subverts the
regional peace process, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said MOnday.
   ``At this juncture, when other conflicts seem to be on the way
to solution, I appeal to the Central American countries and other
countries to renew their collective commitment to peace,'' Perez de
Cuellar said in his annual report on the region,
   Central American governments must redouble efforts to overcome
obstacles ``and the countries outside the region with ties and
interests in it must resolutely decide to facilitate that task and
refrain from any action likely to undermine it,'' he said, without
naming countries.
   The United States supports rebels battling Nicaragua's
Sandinista government. Cuba and the Soviet Union back left-wing
guerrillas in El Salvador and other countries.
   Perez de Cuellar was commenting on the peace agreement signed
Aug. 7, 1987, by the presidents of Costa Rica, Guatemala,
Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. It calls for progress toward
democracy and national reconciliation, noninterference in the
internal affairs of other countries and an end to foreign military
aid.
   ``There has been an apparent lack of similar progress towards
fulfillment of the commitments on non-use of territory to attack
other states and on termination of aid for irregular forces and
insurrectionist movements,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   ``The lack of progress ... has undermined the strategy aimed at
bringing about the cessation of hostilities on the basis of a broad
amnesty and democratization in conjunction with the termination of
aid'' for rebels, he added.
   ``Significant progress'' in democratic reforms was made
immediately after the agreement was signed, Perez de Cuellar said.
He cited establishment of national reconciliation commissions,
amnesty decrees, the lifting of states of emergency, expanding
political pluralism and movements toward ending hostilities.
   Now, however, the principle of simultaneous democratization and
ending aid to rebels appears to have been ``replaced by the
principle of unilateralism,'' he said, and reciprocity must be
restored.
   Central America's development has been hurt by the political
turmoil and the crisis is perpetuating unjust social and economic
structures, Perez de Cuellar declared.

<TEXT>
   The Democratic and Republican party chairmen
briefly put aside their differences on Monday to endorse a
bipartisan television advertising campaign urging Americans to vote.
   They also combined their voices in criticizing news
media-sponsored election polls, which they say discourage voters
from going to the polls.
   The ad campaign, underwritten by Bell Atlantic, relies on
bipartisan commercials urging Americans to ``be more than just
talk'' and vote on Nov. 8.
   ``It seems to me we have lost sight that with the rights granted
under our form of government are certain very, very important and
fundamental responsibilities,'' said GOP Chairman Frank J.
Fahrenkopf Jr., lamenting the traditionally low voter turnout in
U.S. elections.
   ``In this the most advanced Democracy in the world, we have
close to the lowest voter turnout,'' said Democratic Chairman Paul
G. Kirk Jr. About 54 percent of Americans over 18 voted in the 1984
presidential election.
   Kirk, answering questions at a news conference where the ads
were unveiled, said the negative tone of this presidential campaign
has ``turned people off,'' which may affect voting levels this year.
   But he and Fahrenkopf said the media also could do more to
motivate and educate voters with their coverage of the campaign.
   They said they were concerned that polls commissioned by the
media to determine who was ahead in the campaign discouraged voters
from casting a ballot.
   When polls show one candidate comfortably ahead before the
election is over, ``people have a feeling, `What good is my
vote?,''' Fahrenkopf said. Kirk said polls undertaken by the news
media have a ``skewing effect and a psychological effect.''
   The get-out-the-vote ads feature appearances by Presidents
Carter and Ford. Felix Cavaliere of the Rascals singing group
rerecorded his 1968 song, ``People Got To Be Free,'' as the theme.
   The ads were produced in conjunction with Vote America, a
nonpartisan, nonprofit group that works to increase voter
participation.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations celebrated the 43rd
anniversary of its charter Monday with a U.N. Day peace walk in the
rose garden of the New York headquarters and praise of the world
organization's peacekeeping efforts.
   The celebration followed a weekend rebuff by the U.S. Senate
that rejected a Reagan administration request for $150 million to
help support current or anticipated U.N. peacekeeping efforts in
Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf and southern Africa.
   Some senators said they were not satisfied, despite
administration assurances, that U.S. aid to anti-Marxist rebels in
Angola would continue.
   Washington has been withholding regular dues to compel the
United Nations to make budgetary and political reforms. That has
made the United States, which is assessed 25 percent of the budget,
the largest debtor to the United Nations but still its largest
contributor.
   On Oct. 14, the United States paid $85.6 million in back dues,
reducing its regular-budget arrears to $366.3 million. It is
withholding another $59 million until the main U.N. financial
committee adopts austerity measures.
   U.N. officials had little to say Monday about the Senate action.
   ``There is no reaction,'' said Francois Giuliani, spokesman for
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. ``Obviously member
states have a legal obligation to participate in peackeeping
operations, as assessed by the General Assembly, but this is an
internal (U.S.) problem.''
   Officials and diplomats strolled silently through the U.N. rose
garden on the banks of the East River in a meditative ``walk for
peace.''
   In a statement marking U.N. day, Perez de Cuellar said the
United Nations is playing a larger peacemaking role.
   ``After years of drift and decline in multilateral cooperation,
the organization has begun to resume its rightful role in
international life,'' he said.
   Dante Caputo, foreign minister of Argentina and current
president of the General Assembly, told a gathering Sunday at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York that the world
situation is improving and the United Nations has been instrumental
in resolving conflicts.
   ``The threats of nuclear catastrohe, great power tensions and
many regional conflicts and problems have been significantly
lessened this year,'' he declared.
   This year's Nobel Peace Prize went to U.N. peacekeeping
operations around the world.
   Perez de Cuellar praised the peacekeepers in his statement and
said the United Nations ``no longer is bypassed or ignored.''
   He said the United Nations should avoid ``self-congratulation''
because nations with the will to make peace deserve the credit, and
``we are but the servants of this will.''
   The United Nations is the instrument for translating ``the
impulse for peace into concrete agreements,'' he added, and ``helps
show the way to peace with honor and compromise without
capitulation.''

<HEAD>Snow Falls in the Upper Great Lakes As the Sun Shines Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell Tuesday on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and rain spread
from New England southward along the Atlantic coast while much of
the nation was treated to a day of autumn sunshine.
   West and northwest winds blew across the Great Lakes, bringing
much cooler air and cloudy skies to the region and the Ohio Valley.
Wind gusts averaged 25 to 35 mph around the lower Great Lakes.
   Up to 6 inches of snow was reported Monday afternoon at
Ironwood, Mich., and up to 5 inches was measured at Bessemer, with
an additional inch or two expected. Four inches of snow also was
reported at Hurley in Iron County, Wis.
   Light snow fell in northern Indiana and the mountain areas of
Pennsylvania, and rain was scattered across the central Great Lakes.
   In Michigan, heavy rains since early September have turned
grain-rich central areas into mud, and farmers say their fields are
too wet to harvest or plant next year's crops.
   So much rain has fallen since the drought ended that average
statewide precipitation for the year is only 5 inches below the
normal 25{ inches, according to the National Weather Service.
   ``It's so wet and so soggy, (farmers) take their equipment out
there and they just go straight down,'' said Bob Craig of the
Michigan Farm Bureau. ``They get stuck _ it's as simple as that.''
   Elsewhere, skies were mostly sunny across much of the rest of
the country, but low clouds and fog socked in parts of the Pacific
coast.
   Temperatures varied from the 30s and 40s across the upper
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and parts of New England to the
80s in southern Florida, the southern tip of Texas and the desert
Southwest.
   Miami broke its 1979 record high of 88 degrees for the date with
an 89-degree reading. West Palm Beach, Fla., tied its 1983
temperature of 88.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Ely, Hibbing and Thief River Falls, all in Minnesota, to
91 degrees at Gila Bend, Ariz. The low in the nation Tuesday
morning was 11 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Tuesday, northwesterly winds will bring widespread showers
over the Great Lakes and New England, mixed with wet snow at times.
Rain also was forecast for Washington state, while fair skies were
predicted from the northern Rockies through the Plains into the
southern Atlantic states.
   Afternoon highs were expected to reach the 60s and 70s across
much of the country, but in the 40s and 50s from the northern
Rockies and northern Plains through Iowa, the Ohio Valley and New
England and the mid-Atlantic states. For the upper Mississippi
Valley and upper Great Lakes, highs were forecast in the 30s. On
the warm side, highs in the 80s were predicted for southern
Florida, southern and central Texas and across the Southwest to the
interior valleys of California, but in the low to mid 90s in the
desert.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Tells West German Chancellor Soviet Reforms Are
Succeeding</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material and editing throughout, UPDATING with dinner
remarks by Gorbachev, Siemens agreement signed. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said at a state
dinner Monday for West Germany's Helmut Kohl that the Soviet Union
is not an ``economic backyard'' and reforms are succeeding despite
international doubts.
   Lack of progress in relations with the Soviet Union ``feeds on
the outdated stereotypes that the Russians will not be able to
manage by themselves,'' he said. ``I want to say to all who are
going to have business with us _ we will manage.''
   Gorbachev, who also heads the Soviet Communist Party, seemed to
be replying to questions raised in the West about his ability to
stay in power and install his reform program through the upheaval
it is already beginning to cause.
   There has been considerable controversy over the $9 billion in
credits Moscow has arranged in recent months from Western banks,
including some in West Germany. Some politicians oppose such
lending, saying the Soviet Union should be forced to cut defense
spending in order to increase the production of needed food and
consumer products.
   Gorbachev told Soviet television earlier that he and Chancellor
Kohl had started their first meeting of the four-day official visit
with cordial discussions of difficult issues and he said ``we have
a real chance'' to achieve a substantial improvement in relations.
   ``The ice has started to move, and we hope it will start to
float away,'' Gorbachev said.
   Monday's meeting was the first formal meeting between the two
men since Gorbachev became the Soviet leader in 1985.
   Warmer relations with West Germany would be a significant
change. The Soviet Union has for decades acted as if the Nazi
invasion occurred yesterday rather than almost 50 years ago.
   However, Gorbachev refused to budge from Moscow's longtime
refusal to consider any move toward the unification of East and
West Germany.
   Kohl, in his address, called for a ``healing of old wounds.''
   ``It must become possible for the Germans to overcome the
division of their country by peaceful means,'' the chancellor said.
   Following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the nation
split into communist East Germany, a member of the Soviet bloc, and
West Germany, a strong ally of the United States and member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   In a surprise comment during the dinner speech Gorbachev
suggested that Europe needs a unified electrical and transportation
network.
   Kohl also spoke of ``transboundary challenges'' and named
terrorism, drugs and epidemics as issues requiring greater
cooperation. But he said the greatest obstacle to warm relations is
Soviet superiority in conventional armed forces in Europe.
   In a related meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze suggested to West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher that a summit meeting of the leaders of
Europe, the United States and Canada might help produce progress in
Vienna negotiations on reductions in conventional weapons and
forces.
   Among business deals signed between Soviet and West German
enterprises Monday was an agreement by the German Siemens firm to
aid Soviet organizations in the design and creation of nuclear
power stations, computers and medical equipment.
   Soviet-West German relations have been improving in the past
year, especially since the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in December
in Washington when Gorbachev and President Reagan signed a treaty
to ban medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Kohl was greeted at the Vnukovo Airport by Shevardnadze, Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and other top
officials.
   He and his wife Hannelore then went to the Kremlin for a formal
greeting in St. George's Hall by Gorbachev and his wife Raisa.

<HEAD>Police Disperse Demonstrators, Injuries Reported</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police used clubs Monday to
disperse about 500 people protesting a Roman Catholic church order
to transfer an activist priest. Radio stations reported several
injuries, including one person shot in the leg.
   It was the third week of demonstrations protesting the transfer
order of the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, considered to be Haiti's
most popular priest.
   Radio Inter and Radio Antilles, independent stations, said
police struck protesters with billy clubs, injuring several. A
woman told Radio Inter she saw a man shot in the leg.
   The police and army refused comment.
   Ten policemen and two trucks filled with soldiers were on hand
for the protest. The crowd of about 500 was the smallest since the
church order was announced. It was the first time authorities used
force on pro-Aristide demonstrators.
   His superiors at the Salesian Order in Rome want Aristide out of
Haiti on grounds his preaching on ``active non-violence''
encourages class struggle.
   They told the priest to report to the St. Claire church in
Montreal, Canada, by Oct. 17, but friends say he remains in Haiti.
   A massacre at Aristide's slum-neighborhood church Sept. 11, in
which thugs killed 12 people and wounded more than 70, was a factor
in the most recent military coup.
   Sergeants seeking democratic reforms and an end to
state-sponsored violence overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept.
17 and put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power.

<HEAD>Iran Says It's Ready for POW Exchange Under UN Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran told the International Red Cross on
Monday it is ready to exchange prisoners of war with Iraq under the
U.N. peace plan if Iraq agrees to the same terms.
   The Foreign Ministry statement to the International Committee of
the Red Cross in Geneva repeated Iran's assertion that ``it is
prepared for the speedy repatriation of prisoners of war,'' but it
said the exchange must occur under Security Council Resolution 598.
   That resolution, passed unanimously July 20, 1987, and accepted
by Iran a year later, also embodies a peace plan for the 8-year-old
war and the secretary-general's implementation program. Copies of
the Iranian statement were circulated Monday at U.N. headquarters
in New York.
   Iraq has expressed willingness to begin immediate repatriation
of POWs on humanitarian grounds if Iran agrees, but outside the
U.N. peace process.
   Iranian diplomats have said the Iraqi move is an effort to
undermine Resolution 598, which calls for a comprehensive peace,
swift exchange of POWs after a truce and withdrawal to
international borders.
   Iraq has claimed Iran is stalling on the POW issue. Peace talks
in Geneva are deadlocked but plans for the next round are expected
to be announced Tuesday.
   According to Red Cross records Iran has 50,182 Iraqi POWs and
Iraq 19,284 Iranians, but U.N. officials and diplomats in both
countries estimate the totals at 60,000-70,000 held in Iran and
30,000-50,000 in Iraq.
   Iran's letter said it had repatriated hundreds of disabled,
wounded and sick Iraqi prisoners in the past few years with no
reciprocation from Iraq.

<HEAD>Bush Targets Hispanic Voters With Texas Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush's campaign
launched a new advertising drive aimed at Hispanic voters Monday
with bilingual ads featuring his daughter-in-law, Columba, and
three Bush grandchildren.
   In the new Bush ad, Columba Bush, who was born in Mexico and is
the wife of Bush's son Jeb, appears with the couple's three
children and Bush.
   ``For Hispanics like me this presidential election will be the
most important in our history,'' Mrs. Bush begins.
   The vice president winds up the commercial saying, ``As
president, I'll have a lot of reasons to help Hispanics everywhere,
because I'll not only be answering to my grandchildren, I'll be
answering to history.''
   Bush campaign officials said the new advertisement, which is
being aired in both Spanish and English, is designed to take
advantage of what they called Spanish-speaking Michael Dukakis'
failure to appeal to the substantial Hispanic vote in Texas.
   ``We think, from our internal surveys, that there is a
tremendous opportunity in the (Rio Grande) Valley and within the
Hispanic community overall in the state,'' said Reggie Bashur,
deputy campaign manager.
   ``Dukakis has not gotten his message through in Texas, and
clearly he has not gotten a message through to Hispanics,'' Bashur
said.
   Mark Sanders, a Bush campaign spokesman, said the commercial
began airing Monday on stations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio,
the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso. They will run until the Nov. 8
election, he said, while declining to say how much money was being
spent on them.

<TEXT>
   A television news program said two Soviet
icebreakers were on their way Monday to help rescue a pair of
whales who became trapped in arctic ice off Alaska because they
were ``young, inexperienced and curious.''
   Soviet media have been restrained in reporting the dramatic
effort to free the two California grey whales, who were stranded in
the ice while trying to migrate south.
   The news program, Vremya, told the story best with film of the
crystalline arctic scene where Eskimos were chain-sawing breathing
holes in the ice for the mammals trying to migrate south.
   It also showed one of the whales popping up for air in a channel
cut in the ice, and provided a close-up of an ice-cutting tractor
and of weights being dropped from a helicopter to crack the ice.
   But the morning newspaper Pravda made no mention of the whales'
situation, which has drawn worldwide attention. The afternoon paper
Izvestia carried only a short item reporting that the Soviet
icebreaking ships Admiral Makarov and Vladimir Arseniev could
arrive off the Alaskan coast as early as Monday evening to offer
assistance.
   Other Soviet newspapers do not publish on Monday.
   Soviet help was requested because the United States did not have
an icebreaker near the site, off Point Barrow.
   The official news agency Tass noted in its report that whales
are an endangered species, or, in Soviet parlance, ``in the red
book'' that lists plants and animals with dangerously low
populations.
   Neither Tass nor Izvestia mentioned that the Soviet Union hunted
whales until May 1987.
   At the time, the Soviet Union was the world's second-largest
whaling nation. It halted its harvest only after the United States
imposed sanctions by cutting in half the amount of fish the Soviets
were allowed to take from U.S. waters.
   The Soviet Union then said it might resume whale-hunting in 1990
if the population of the animals had risen sufficiently.
   Many Soviets have embraced environmentalism with ferocity in the
past year, as the policy of glasnost, or openness, has allowed
citizens to protest the effects of years of industrial development
that ignored the ecology.
   It is unclear whether the Soviet ships will arrive in time or do
much good because the ocean may be too shallow at the site of the
ice blockage.
   ``Time is pressing,'' Izvestia said. ``The situation of the
whales is worsening in the eyes of the rescuers.''
   Vremya was more optimistic, predicting the whales would soon be
heading toward open water ``due to the efforts of people from both
countries.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Monday he believes the positive Soviet response to the U.S. request
is due more to the current spirit of goodwill and cooperation
between the two nations than to the terms of a 1976 environmental
agreement betweem Washington and Moscow.

<HEAD>Arafat Seeks Turkish Backing for Independent Palestinian State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat met on Monday
with Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal and President Kenan Evren in his
fast-paced quest for support for an independent Palestinian state
in the Israeli-occupied lands.
   The leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization flew to
Ankara from Iraq, where he held weekend discussions with presidents
Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
   Arafat and Mubarak first met King Hussein of Jordan in Aqaba,
Jordan, on Saturday and then went on to Iraq.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
is scheduled to meet next month in Algeria to decide on an
independent Palestinian state.
   British diplomat William Waldegrave said Monday in Abu Dhabi,
United Arab Emirates, that Britain welcomed peace moves by Jordan's
Hussein and Arafat, and said if Israel failed to respond, ``then it
will find itself very isolated in the world community.''
   Waldegrave, minister of state for foreign and Commonwealth
affairs, told a news conference at the British Embassy: ``I think
we can have some influence on the United States in bringing it to
see that Israel must respond.''
   But in an interview broadcast in London on Monday, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said the PLO will never change,
and so Israel _ which views the PLO as a terrorist organization _
will never negotiate with it.
   In Cairo, Egypt, visiting Norwegian Defense Minister Johan
Joergen Holst said Monday that the recent meetings of Arab leaders
showed ``something is happening'' which will bring closer an
international peace conference.
   Holst said of the Jordanian-Egyptian-Palestinian summit on
Saturday: ``I think this meeting serves eloquent notice that
something is happening (with) a new initiative and a new momentum.
   ``I think this will bring the world closer to the international
peace conference to settle the problem,'' he added.
   Both the United States and Israel oppose convening an
international conference on the Arab-Israel conflict with PLO
participation.
   Turkey's Ozal said in a dinner speech that he believed the
Palestine National Council ``will adopt a policy that will lead to
a legitimate and lasting peace process in the Middle East.''
   Ozal said the Palestinian problem could come to an end with the
recognition of the legitimate rights of Palestinian people,
including self-determination and establishment of an independent
state. He said Israeli troops should withdraw from the occupied
Arab lands.
   Turkey recognizes the PLO as the sole legitimate representative
of the Palestinian people.
   In Amman, Jordan, a senior PLO official said Monday that King
Hussein's meeting with Arafat signaled a ``new era in the history
of relations between Jordan and the PLO.''
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting ``had a positive impact on all aspects of
Jordanian-Palestinian relations.''
   He said the simultaneous Amman meetings of the joint committee
that disperses funds in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip were held in a ``brotherly atmosphere.''
   The PLO official told The Associated Press that the committee
meetings focused on the situation in the occupied territories, torn
by a Palestinian uprising since last December, and ways of
increasing financial aid from Arab countries.
   In his broadcast remarks, Shamir dismissed as a ``tactical step
of doubletalk'' any notion of the PLO's reconciling itself to
Israel's existence.
   Shamir said on British Broadcasting Corp. radio: ``We know the
PLO. They will never change their character, their philosophy, and
therefore we will never negotiate with them.''
   Asked if he had any sympathy for the Palestinian demand for a
homeland, Shamir said: ``My objective is to solve our problems and
not the problems of the Arabs and Palestinians.''

   Hampshire College President Adele Simmons has
been selected to head the MacArthur Foundation, one of the nation's
largest philanthropic organizations, a foundation spokesman said
Monday.
   ``We are delighted to have settled on Mrs. Simmons to become
president of the foundation,'' said Thornton Bradshaw, chairman of
the foundation's board of directors.
   Mrs. Simmons, 47, became president of Hampshire College in
Amherst, Mass., in 1977.
   ``Adele has been central to Hampshire's success,'' said John
Watts, chairman of the college's board of trustees. ``Her
contributions will serve the college well for many years to come.''
   The foundation, formally known as the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation, has assets of $2.5 billion and annual grants
of $127 million, in fields ranging from health, education and
environmental concerns to international peace and cooperation and
mass communications.
   John Corbally, who has directed the foundation's philanthropic
efforts since 1979, will retire in May 1989.

<HEAD>Museum Decides To Return Ancient Lintel Thais Claimed Was Stolen</HEAD>

   An ancient stone carving that Thailand said was
stolen from its country will be returned by the Art Institute of
Chicago in an effort to end the ongoing dispute, the institute said
Monday.
   The lintel will be returned in exchange for an artifact ``of
equal artistic merit'' to be donated by the Chicago-based Elizabeth
F. Cheney Foundation, a philanthropic group that wanted to help
resolve the dispute, said institute spokeswoman Virginia Voedisch.
   The museum has maintained that it obtained the lintel
legitimately as a donation from a private foundation and had
refused Thailand's demands that it be returned.
   But protesters, who say the artwork is the Thai equivalent of
the Statue of Liberty torch, have demanded its return. Negotiations
between the museum and Thai officials broke off in July, Ms.
Voedisch said.
   ``The Elizabeth F. Cheney Foundation and the Art Institute, in a
desire to resolve the stalemate in negotiations and maintain the
positive relationship that existed between Thailand and the United
States, has erected a solution,'' Ms. Voedisch said.
   ``Upon receipt of this gift, The Art Institute will relinquish
all rights and title to the lintel and donate it to Thailand,'' the
museum said in a statement.
   Ms. Voedisch said a decision was expected soon on a replacement
for the lintel, and that the lintel would be returned at that time.
   The museum and the foundation are considering several works, but
no decision on a replacement for the lintel has been made, she said.
   She said Thai officials had been alerted of the museum's
decision, but she did not think a response had been received by the
Art Institute.
   The lintel, a 2-by-3 foot stone crosspiece designed to fit above
a door or window, depicts in relief the Hindu god Vishnu reclining
on water. It dates to Cambodia's Khmer dynasty, covering the years
805-1250.
   It disappeared from the Phnom Rung temple, a national monument
in northeastern Thailand during the 1960s, Thai officials say.
   In February 1988, 21 years after the lintel was first displayed
at the Art Institute, the museum learned that the Thai government
wanted it returned for the temple's restoration, the museum said.
   Negotiations between Thai officials and the Art Institute began
at that time.
   Thai demonstrators protested outside the museum earlier this
year, trying to have it returned in time for reopening ceremonies
at the Thai temple in May.
   The Art Institute received the lintel from the Chicago-based
Alsdorf Foundation, which acquired it in 1967 through a New York
art dealer, the museum said.
   The New York dealer in turn purchased the carving in 1966 from a
dealer in Bangkok, where it was being offered for sale on the open
market, the Art Institute said.

   The nation's hens shelled out an estimated
5.55 billion eggs last month, down 2 percent from September 1987,
the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   But there were 3 percent fewer hens in laying flocks in
September _ an estimated average of 272 million birds during the
month, compared with 281 million a year ago, the department said in
its monthly report.
   Thus, each hen worked harder, averaging 2,037 eggs per 100

<TEXT>
   The captain of an Italian freighter that
collided with a Greek cruise ship and left two people dead and two
others missing appeared in court Monday on manslaughter charges and
said he was not to blame for the accident.
   Capt. Flavio Caminale, of Genoa, Italy, was arrested Friday
after his freighter Adige hit and sank a Greek cruise ship carrying
486 British students and their teachers.
   Two Greek seamen were killed and more than 60 people were
injured before the 6,300-ton cruise ship Jupiter went down less
than one mile off Piraeus harbor near Athens. Two British
passengers _ Vivienne Barley, 14, and Bernard Butt, 41 _ were
missing and presumed dead, the Merchant Marine Ministry said.
   Caminale, 45, is charged with manslaughter through negligence,
causing serious injuries, causing a shipwreck and ignoring shipping
regulations.
   ``I'm innocent,'' Caminale said during the 30-minute hearing.
   ``I was not technically responsible for this tragedy and am very
sorry about the death of these people,'' a weeping Caminale said
outside court.
   District attorney Antonis Roussos and investigating magistrate
Telemachus Flezouras ordered the captain detained pending a court
appearance Wednesday in which he will be questioned and the charges
formally recorded.
   Under Greek judicial procedure, a defendant must be presented
with the charges in a court the next working day after his arrest.
In a subsequent hearing, he is questioned at length and the
magistrate revises the charges if necessary before formalizing them.
   The magistrate will decide Wednesday whether Caminale will be
jailed pending trial. If convicted of the charges, Caminale could
spend one to five years in prison.
   The 5,500-ton Adige was sailing into Piraeus with a cargo of
automobiles when it punched a hole in the side of the Jupiter,
which was taking the British children and their teachers on an
eight-day Mediterranean cruise. The children jumped overboard and
were picked up by tugboats and fishing vessels before the Jupiter
sank 40 minutes later.
   Two Jupiter crewmen died when they were crushed against the
ship's side as they tried to attach cables from a tugboat.
   More than 60 passengers were hospitalized, most suffering from
shock and minor injuries. All but one have returned to Britain.
   None of the Adige's 22-member crew was injured and the vessel
suffered only minor damage.
   Greek and Italian accounts of the collision differ sharply.
   The Jupiter's chief mate, Kyriakos Moustakis, said the Adige was
heading toward the cruise ship on a collision course and failed to
change direction.
   Under international maritime rules, ships leaving harbor have
right of way.
   Caminale said the Adige was waiting for a Greek pilot to assist
it in docking and was not moving when the Jupiter changed course
and plowed into its prow.
   In the Italian port city of Genoa, Aldo Grimaldi, owner of the
Italian freighter, said Monday that Greek officials were trying to
hide the truth about the accident to protect their own tourism.
   ``The Greek press ... is accomplishing this moral lynching of
Commander Caminale ... We have asked for the intervention of the
Ministry of the Merchant Marine and the Foreign Ministry as well as
the Italian ambassador in Athens to protect the good name of the
Italian merchant navy and of our crew that did all it could to save
human lives,'' he added.
   Grimaldi echoed Caminale's comments that the Italian ship had
stopped when the Jupiter changed course and struck the Italian ship
in the bow as it turned.

   The late Teamsters president Jackie Presser
could hire as he saw fit at his local and did so in conjunction
with his secret role as an FBI informant, a defense lawyer said in
opening statements at a racketeering trial Monday.
   Harold Friedman, 66, and Anthony Hughes, 52, are the remaining
defendants in an alleged ``ghost employee'' scheme federal
prosecutors contended was masterminded by Presser, international
president of the Teamsters from 1983 until July 9, when he died of
brain cancer.
   The first prosecution witness in a trial that could run eight
weeks was Richard A. Crino, an area administrator with the U.S.
Department of Labor.
   He explained the federal financial disclosure statement union
locals are required to submit. The documents contain names of paid
employees at Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland, some of whom
allegedly were paid but did no work.
   Friedman, a Teamsters international vice president and president
of 5,000-member Local 507 in Cleveland, has since replaced Presser
as president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters.
   Friedman is charged with two counts of labor racketeering, two
of embezzlement and two of filing false reports with the Department
of Labor.
   Anthony Hughes, 52, recording secretary at the local, faces two
counts of labor racketeering and one of embezzlement.
   They and Presser were indicted May 16, 1986.
   The indictment alleges that four men were hired and paid more
than $700,000 while doing no work for the union. Hughes is alleged
to have been one of the so-called ``ghosts,'' getting paid by
Bakery Workers Local 19 in Cleveland, a close affiliate of
Teamsters Local 507. Allen Friedman, George Argie and Jack Nardi
were identified in the indictment as Teamsters Local 507 ghosts.
   Since the indictment, the Justice Department has revealed that
Presser and Hughes had been FBI informants, providing information
about the union and possible links to organized crime.
   Two FBI agents based in Cleveland in 1985 gave sworn statements
during an FBI internal investigation that Presser was authorized to
place certain people on the Local 507 payroll in order to protect
his informant status.
   Paul J. Cambria Jr., Friedman's attorney, said in opening
statements that the bylaws of Local 507 give its
secretary-treasurer full authority to hire business agents and
assign them their duties. Presser was the local's secretary
treasurer, Cambria said; Friedman was its president.
   ``But Presser's gone. He's not here to talk about what he told
my client and others. And in this case, that's a crime and that my
client is here on trial is a crime,'' Cambria said.
   Cambria told the jury Friedman had nothing to do with Presser
relationship with the FBI.
   Allen Friedman, Argie and Nardi are expected to testify for the
government, said prosecutor Stephen Jigger, head of the Cleveland
office of the Justice Department's Strike Force Against Organized
Crime.
   Jigger said in his opening statement that testimony will reveal
that Presser and Hughes set up a ``sham defense'' in 1985 with the
help of an FBI agent in an attempt to block an embezzlement
prosecution.
   ``Very simply, this case is about the abuse of union office by
Jackie Presser, Harold Friedman and Anthony Hughes by paying in
excess of $700,000 to people who did no work,'' Jigger said.
   Detailed defense demands for government documents plus Presser's
health problems resulted in repeated delays of the trial, which
U.S. District Judge George White originally scheduled to start more
than a year ago.
   Jurors were selected Friday.

<HEAD>More Than $600,000 and Counting in Whale Rescue Effort</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Trapped Whales, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARROW, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The effort to free two whales trapped by
bitter cold and shifting ice in the high Arctic has taken on a life
of its own and costs are climbing.
   Many of those involved in the attempt seem reluctant to discuss
the tab _ but it appears substantial, upward of $600,000 by late
Monday.
   Increasing numbers of agencies and companies _ from the Alaska
Army National Guard to the oil industry to a custom sewing company
in California _ have donated time or equipment in the past two
weeks. Now, two Soviet icebreakers are involved.
   Rear Admiral Sigmund Petersen of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration said Monday that all agencies involved
in the attempt were determined to continue until the endangered
California gray whales are freed. But he admitted he had personal
concerns.
   ``There are a lot of expenditures being made, I understand
that,'' he said. ``Somehow, it may have gotten out of control. We
decided at the very beginning that there was a need for saving
these whales. They were caught here and stranded and NOAA has
responsibility for endangered species.
   NOAA biologist Ron Morris ``was asked to come up here to
evaluate the situation. An offer was made to move this (hover)
barge over here,'' he said. ``Then there was one offer after
another that wasn't turned down. All of a sudden we were in a
massive type of operation.''
   North Slope Borough officials said that as of Friday, their
outlay had topped $300,000. Spokeswoman Marie Adams said the
borough was asking for donations to a special fund to offset the
expenses.
   ``A lot of people are calling in with their pledges, but they
aren't sending checks,'' she said. ``We're getting the phone calls,
but not the checks.''
   She said she knew of only one $100 check being received. ``It
takes a while for the mail to get up here,'' she said. But she said
she was not optimistic.
   Veco Inc., an oil field construction and service company,
donated use of the $3 million ``hover-barge'' first employed in the
rescue attempt. That effort was abandoned six miles offshore near
Prudhoe Bay when Army National Guard helicopters could not tow the
craft over coastal mud, shallow water and sand bars.
   The National Guard usually charges $1,500 to $3,000 an hour for
use of its CH-54 Skycrane helicopters, officials said. The Guard
said that because of the ongoing nature of the operation, there was
no estimate of the hours the helicopter has flown in the
hover-barge operation or in later efforts to smash holes in the ice
near the whales.
   Veco on Saturday donated an ice-breaking tractor to the effort.
   ``We've got a ballpark number, you know, without figuring the
hover-barge or the tractor, just out of pocket, of about $150,000
to $200,000 in this,'' said Bill Allen, chairman of the company's
board of directors.
   Efforts to recover the Veco barge were underway Monday.
   ARCO Alaska Inc. supplied fuel for the barge and the helicopters
and provided living quarters for the National Guard in Prudhoe Bay.
``We don't have a figure yet,'' said company spokeswoman Veronica
Dent. ``Those costs are still coming in.''
   Standard Alaska Production Co. provided heaters, tow cable,
manpower and a chain saw mechanic at Barrow. The company also
fabricated poles to push ice out of breathing holes. But there was
no estimate of Standard's costs.
   Omark Industries Inc. has donated at least $10,500 in chain saws
and saw chains.
   The tractor donated by Veco was ferried to Barrow from Prudhoe
Bay aboard an Air Force C-5A, the largest plane in the U.S.
military inventory. ``The C-5 flew about 4\ hours carrying the
equipment. At almost $6,500 an hour and some change, that makes
about $30,000,'' said Capt. Tom Dolney of the Military Airlift
Command at Scott Air Force Base, Ill.
   Petersen estimated his agency has spent about $6,000 on the
operation.

   Former Gen. Ariel Sharon, who was forced out as
defense minister in 1983 after massacres of Palestinians in
Lebanon, said Monday he wants the job back and will crush the
revolt in the occupied lands if he gets it.
   Israeli soldiers opened fire on stone-throwers Monday in the
West Bank's Faraa refugee camp, killing a 17-year-old Palestinian,
hospital officials said.
   Mohammed Shaheed's death raised to at least 302 the number of
Arabs killed since the uprising began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million
Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Six Israelis also
have been slain.
   Sharon, a hero of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, was touring an
outdoor market when he expressed his desire to regain his old post.
The area is a stronghold of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
conservative Likud bloc, for which Sharon is a candidate in the
Nov. 1 parliamentary elections.
   ``After the elections, the first thing that must be done is to
restore peace and quiet immediately'' in the occupied territories,
said Sharon, who had a heavy guard of riot police.
   ``That is what has to be done and I have the means to do it,''
he told reporters.
   Dozens of vegetable vendors and shoppers in the crowded Mahane
Yehuda Market cheered and showered the former general with candy
and kisses. They called ``You're our man!'' and ``Only you can end
the intefadeh!'' using the Arabic word for uprising.
   Yitzhak Rabin now is defense minister. He is a former prime
minister and represents the Labor Party, which is in a fractious
coalition with Likud and is led by Shamir's rival, Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres.
   The uprising and the future of the occupied territories have
become major election issues. They filled most of the time Sunday
night in the only televised debate between Shamir and Peres.
   Two independent newspaper polls said Monday that Peres won the
debate, but Labor and Likud are generally considered to be about
even in the contest for the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's
parliament.
   The daily Haaretz said 21 percent of 400 Israelis telephoned
after the debate said Peres won and 12 percent said Shamir was the
victor.
   Yediot Ahronot said it interviewed 460 people, and Peres was
rated highest on economic and peace-related issues. Most Israeli
analysts say, however, that the effect of the debate on the
election is expected to be martinal.
   Peres cut a tour of the northern town of Hadera short Monday
after Likud supporters shouted him down. Peres shouted back angrily
several times, but finally left Hadera.
   Sharon said on his hour-long visit to the the market that ``I
certainly can be one of those who can do the job well'' as defense
minister if Likud wins the election.
   He resigned as defense minister in 1983, when Israeli forces
were occupying Lebanon, after an inquiry found him indirectly
responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in the
Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps by Lebanese militiamen allied with
Israel.
   He has been industry and trade minister since 1984 and has made
a political comeback, but has been staying out of the election
spotlight.
   Moshe Behagon, Sharon's spokesman, said recent trips abroad for
trade talks were the reason for his few appearances, but party
officials said Likud wanted to avoid reminding voters of the
unpopular Lebanon war.
   A Likud official suggested privately that Sharon's silence was
part of a power struggle with Moshe Arens, who is the Likud
campaign manager and also wants to be defense minister.
   Some reports say Sharon had been asked to make more appearances
because Likud surveys showed many of the bloc's supporters were
leaning toward small parties of the extreme right because of the
Palestinian rebellion.
   Political observers say Sharon stands a fairly good chance of
becoming defense minister. His main competition is Arens. Although
Arens is Shamir's closest aide in the government, Shamir may prefer
giving the job to Sharon to avoid stirring political discontent.
   In Monday's clashes, seven Palestinians were wounded, one in the
West Bank town of Nablus and six in the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital
officials reported.
   Officials at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis said a 7-year-old boy
was shot in the chest and transferred in serious condition to Tel
Aviv's Tel Hashomer hospital.
   One victim in Gaza was a 6-year-old girl hit in the leg,
apparently by a stray plastic bullet, according to doctors at Shifa
Hospital in Gaza City.

<TEXT>
   Actress Brigitte Nielsen will undergo laser
surgery for an undisclosed procedure this week, but her condition
is not life-threatening, her publicist said Monday.
   The New York Times quoted Nielsen as saying last week that she
had cancer of the uterus and planned to enter an unspecified
Arizona hospital Monday for a biopsy. However, friends close to her
fiance, former New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, have
said it's unlikely Nielsen is gravely ill.
   Publicist Joel Brokaw said from Los Angeles that he spoke with
Nielsen late Monday afternoon, while she was still with her doctor.
   Brokaw said she did not tell him what the condition was, that
she said it was not life-threatening, but it could rapidly become
so if not taken care of promptly.
   He said he had no information on the planned surgery.
   Gastineau last week announced he was quitting football because
he wanted to help Nielsen through her illness. He and Nielsen last
week flew to Arizona, where his family lives.
   Gastineau's estranged wife said Sunday she didn't think her
husband was quitting football because of Nielsen's illness, and the
New York and Long Island newspaper Newsday quoted two friends of
Gastineau as saying Nielsen did not have cancer.

<HEAD>`Warrior Ant' Opens Next Wave Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some offerings in the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's annual Next Wave Festival are avant-garde and some reach
for the far out.
   ``The Warrior Ant,'' opening production of the sixth season, is
one of the latter. There is an audience for big, elaborate stage
devices, rock-concert-loud music and general oddness. This is the
audience _ which also must be able to swallow large helpings of
muddle and pretentiousness _ for ``The Warrior Ant.''
   The three-hour show, already seen at the Spoleto Festival in
Charleston, in Philadelphia and at Yale University, opened Sunday
night at the Brooklyn Academy's Majestic Theater.
   Act 1 is like a Mardi Gras. It starts with a metal toy ant
scooting out onto the stage. A narrator in a periwig says, ``On the
sixth day, there was created crawling things and it was good.'' He
goes on to explain that ants are conceived on one night of the
year, known as Funky Tuesday, and that, like bees, drones die and
queens live.
   Most of this long act is very busy, with floats atop small cars,
choreographed break dancers, steel-drum bands and amplified
Caribbean-style singing, with the words not understood. Lengthy
narration, intended as an epic poem, is vacuous, with pretentious
``literary'' wording, usually ending in a ``now'' zinger, such as
``He blew me away.''
   A tall metal ant standing upright, legs waving, is wheeled on
for the finale. From its innards comes a Japanese doll, the title
character.
   In Act 2, the ant and a worm, manipulated by Bunraku puppeteers
Yoshida Tamamatsu and Kanju Kiritake and five assistants, go
through ``the path of least resistance'' in ``a forgotten circle of
hell'' where artists reside. Steel drummers and a string quartet
provide accompaniment for this and some bellydancing. After a few
snipes via a narrator at artists, the ant finds his father, a
termite, and they have an existentialist conversation that's fairly
hard to follow.
   In Act 3, the ant falls in love with a Death Moth. There are
songs and narration, which here becomes so flowery and rococo it is
funny.
   ``The Warrior Ant'' is the first time the Osaka, Japan, Bunraku
puppet theater has collaborated on a Western project. Development
of the play began in 1984. Lee Breuer, Liza Lorwin and Bob Telson,
who developed ``The Gospel at Colonus,'' which told the Oedipus
story in gospel music and drew parallels with Jesus, produced.
Breuer directed. In Brooklyn, Mabou Mines in a co-producer. They
plan a 12-hour, 12-part epic, with more episodes of the ant's life.
   Since a viewer's reaction after seeing the three finished parts
is that of having seen something silly, they might consider turning
to something else.

<HEAD>Boys Town Student Mayor Still Waiting Reply From Bush, Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOYS TOWN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young people haven't received the
recognition that's due them from presidential candidates George
Bush and Michael Dukakis, Boys Town student mayor Corey Randall
said Monday.
   Randall, 17, a senior, sent letters Sept. 27 to the two
presidential candidates, listing the main issues facing children
and youth.
   The mayor, whose duties are much like those of a student body
president, was still waiting for a reply, and said he was
disappointed in not getting one.
   Randall drafted the letters after students in religion classes
at the home for abused and neglected youth were asked to vote on
topics they thought the next president should address.
   Part of the letter read: ``We come from 44 of the 50 states in
the Union, and we know from our own personal experiences of
brokenness _ perhaps better than most boys and girls in America _
the importance of these issues.''
   The most important issues listed by the students included:
freedom from abuse; freedom from hunger; good health care; literacy
for children; therapy for abuse and neglect; hope for children
without homes and away from home; and good schools.
   Randall said that if Republican Bush and Democrat Dukakis do
respond, he would like them to tell the 500 children of Boys Town
what they're going to do about childrens' needs.

   The Navy captain whose ship shot down a
civilian aircraft over the Persian Gulf disputed a Pentagon
report's suggestion that stress played a role in the tragedy, as
the crew arrived Monday for an emotional homecoming.
   ``There, of course, were mistakes made and there always are in
an intense combat environment,'' Capt. Will C. Rogers III said at a
news conference. ``But both my crew and the system performed
basically as designed. No particular mistake was critical to the
engagement decision ... It's my opinion that stress was not a
factor during the entire engagement proceedings.''
   The official Pentagon report concluded the crew of the USS
Vincennes mistook the airliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter jet on
July 3, resulting in the deaths of all 290 people aboard. It said
crew members misinterpreted computer and radar data because of
stress in their first combat situation. At the time, the Vincennes
was engaged in a firefight with several Iranian gunboats.
   Monday's return of the Aegis-class cruiser marked the end of a
six-month deployment for the crew of the Vincennes, named for a
Revolutionary War battle near Vincennes.
   ``We're glad to be home, I assure you of that. This is a nice
place,'' said Rogers, who earlier got a kiss, a hug and flowers
from his wife, Sharon.
   After a brief welcoming ceremony featuring William Rose, mayor
of Vincennes, Ind., and Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif., of San Diego,
the 380 sailors poured off the ship into a sea of relatives,
friends and Navy colleagues.
   One woman held a sign that read, ``I love you Beefcake
Collins.'' A little girl waved to her father and said ``Hi, daddy.
You're home!'' One sailor bolted down the gangway, crying ``Hi
mom,'' and gave his mother a hug.
   ``I don't even know what we were doing there. It's a tragedy
that it happened. But I'm glad I'm home and I'm alive,'' said Petty
Officer 3rd Class Steve Hile of Niles, Mich., who got a warm
embrace from his girlfriend, Vallita Lawwill.
   Rogers said the fate of the USS Stark, on which 37 sailors died
in an Iraqi missile attack, was in the back of his mind throughout
the Vincennes deployment.
   ``No skipper sails in the (Persian) Gulf without the Stark at
least in your subconscious,'' Rogers said. ``Was it a factor during
that decision process? I don't consciously remember.''
   In response to a question from an Iranian reporter, Rogers said
he regretted the loss of civilian life. Asked if there were lessons
in the tragedy, he said: ``We wish we had 100 percent hindsight.
That's not a luxury you have in combat.''
   The captain said that he knew within 1{ hours after ordering two
missiles fired that the target destroyed was a civilian airliner.
Rogers said he later assembled the crew to tell them the news and
that they took it quietly.
   ``At first we were all devastated,'' Rogers said. ``It goes
without saying. But I have to look at it, and my crew looks at it,
that given the fact that the airliner made no indication that it
was not a hostile craft, we had no other choice.
   ``So our grief and our despair over that is tempered by the
knowledge that we did what we had to do when we had to do it ... I
reviewed those few seconds one hundred times, one thousand times.
My decision was correct.''
   Navy chaplain Ted Atwood, who visited the crew from Sept. 27 to
Oct. 5 and talked frequently with the families of crew members,
said many sailors came to grips with the tragedy on the way home.
   ``When I was on board, I did not see a single depressed
sailor,'' Atwood said. ``Of course, the loss of lives is grievous
in any situation. I think they absorbed it and they have dealt with
it and they have grown beyond that grievous incident.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush is running 11
points ahead of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in California as
the presidential race heads into its final two weeks, the Los
Angeles Times reported.
   The poll, prepared for Tuesday's editions, showed Bush had a 53
percent to 42 percent lead over Dukakis.
   The Times' poll found that Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, has
failed to excite voters in a state considered vital in the race for
the presidency, the newspaper reported.
   Dukakis is running comfortably ahead in the San Francisco Bay
area and is even with the GOP's candidate in Los Angeles County,
but Bush is ahead in the rest of the state, the poll said.
   The Times polled 1,376 registered voters during the fours days
that ended Sunday. The margin of error was four percentage points.

   Two Soviet icebreakers steamed toward U.S.
waters to join the drive to save two stranded whales Monday, while
rescuers appeared to lose ground in their efforts to coax the
imprisoned mammals toward freedom.
   Biologists stopped cutting new breathing holes through the
Beaufort Sea ice Monday evening after the whales, apparently
spooked by a shoal, headed back toward the shoreline where they
have been trapped for more than two weeks.
   With Eskimo crews providing the backbreaking labor, biologists
switched tactics in the frustrating effort to get the whales
through the shallow water.
   First, they connected a series of intermittent breathing holes
to form a single open channel some 600 yards long.
   Instead of pushing the ice blocks back under the adjacent ice,
the Eskimos used long poles to guide the miniature icebergs to the
rear of the slot.
   The idea was to try to keep the whales from reversing their
course toward the nearest open water.
   Initially the strategy worked. The whales would swim back and
forth between the edge of the shoal and the rear of the ice-clogged
channel.
   ``They're doing what they're supposed to,'' said federal whale
biologist David Withrow, as the back-filling operation forced the
whales toward the shoal.
   But when the channel behind them was almost completely filled,
the whales reversed course, struggling up through the large slabs
of ice and thick slush.
   ``It's discouraging,'' Withrow said as the whales began
surfacing farther and farther back from the shoal. ``Why come back
here when they know it's open up there?''
   The California gray whales must get over the shoal and through
the ice ridge to reach an open lead, or pathway, through the ice.
The nearest completely open water is 200 miles away in the Chukchi
Sea.
   The ridge, formed by the collision of two ice masses, is a
jumble of ice chunks, some the size of small houses. It stretches
for miles, and at points is a quarter-mile wide and looms 15 feet
above sea level, said Rear Adm. Sigmund R. Petersen, director of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific
Marine Center in Seattle.
   Biologists said they were considering the possibility they might
have to airlift the animals to open water.
   ``We're having a net built right now'' to carry them, Withrow
said Sunday.
   But he emphasized that an airlift was the least preferred
alternative, to be used only if all else fails, because the whales
could be injured. Smaller whales have been captured, but not in the
midst of ice fields.
   The whales, stranded about 100 yards offshore more than two
weeks ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of Barrow, were
about four miles from the ice ridge, Petersen said. A third whale
disappeared Friday and is presumed dead.
   ``We're preparing to go out there and take a look at the
ridge,'' Petersen said. ``We have some expertise here on ice and
icebreaking. We're going to look at that and be prepared to speak
to the Soviet ships.''
   The icebreakers, requested by Greenpeace USA, the environmental
group, and by the State Department and NOAA, were moving at about
seven knots and expected to arrive during the night.
   The captain of the Seattle-based Coast Guard icebreaker Polar
Sea, Capt. Joseph J. McClelland Jr., was expected in Barrow to work
as a liaison officer with the Soviets.
   It was hoped that at least one of the Soviet vessels would be
able to breach the ice ridge, called a pressure ridge, at its
narrowest point. ``We think they can reach the pressure ridge. But
there is a question of whether the big one can go in there,''
Petersen said.
   The larger of the two vessels, the Admiral Makorov, is 443 feet
long and needs about 35 feet of water to operate, he said. The
smaller vessel, the ice-breaking cargo ship Vladimir Arseniev,
needs about 22 feet, Petersen said. Charts indicate the water depth
at the ridge is about 30 feet.
   ``It does seem that the Makorov would have more trouble doing
this,'' he said. ``But they may be able to assist each other. I'm
sure that these vessels, which have operated in the Arctic for
years, have all kinds of solutions to these things.''
   Meanwhile, rescuers tested a 12-ton tractor that smashes up to
18 inches of ice as it moves along on pontoons shaped like augers.
The pontoons work on the same principle as the ancient Archimedes
screw or an auger.
   Its operators said they were pleased with its performance, and
North Slope Borough officials said they were impressed with what it
could do, but they were not sure how useful it would be in freeing
the whales.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Richard Celeste on Monday toned down his
demand that a federally owned uranium processing plant be closed
until something is done to stop the pollution it creates.
   Celeste urged instead that the nuclear weapons plant's
production workers be involved in a cleanup of the site near
Fernald, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   Celeste spoke at a news conference where he appeared with
leaders of a coalition of 14 striking employees' unions at the
plant, known officially as the Feed Materials Production Center.
   Last Tuesday, Celeste sent President Reagan a letter demanding a
shutdown of the plant until measures could be taken to ensure the
health and safety of employees and residents. But that same day,
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, disagreed with Celeste and said the
Department of Energy is more likely to proceed with cleaning up
radioactive wastes on the plant's 1,050-acre site if the facility
stays in operation.
   The governor said he would not want to see the Energy Department
abandon the plant. DOE officials said last week they have no plans
to close the plant and have already begun a 10-year, $500 million
program to clean up and modernize it.
   ``I shudder to think what would happen if the Department of
Energy tried to wash its hands of this facility,'' Celeste said.
``We know that a cleanup can be accomplished, and the people best
to do it are the people who work there.''
   The plant has been widely criticized since the DOE admitted in
January 1985 that at least 200,000 pounds of radioactive uranium
oxide dust have been released into the atmosphere from the plant
during its 37 years of operation.
   Celeste said he sent a telegram Monday to Energy Secretary John
Herrington requesting a meeting to review the federal plans and
timetable for cleaning up the plant site. The department received
the telegram in Washington but Herrington had no immediate response
on when such a meeting might occur, department spokesman Tom Bauman
said.
   The state of Ohio has had a lawsuit pending against the Energy
Department since 1985, accusing it of polluting air and water at
the site. State officials and environmentalists are worried that
radioactive runoff from the plant could threaten the underground
Great Miami River aquifer, which supplies water for businesses and
some southwestern Ohio communities.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua is asking the General Assembly
once again to condemn the United States for ignoring a World Court
ruling that bars U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels.
   Nicaragua also is protesting what it says is U.S. interference
in its domestic affairs.
   The Nicaraguan resolution _ identical to one submitted last year
and marking the third consecutive year Nicaragua makes the request
_ says all states are obliged under international law not to
intervene in the internal affairs of other states.
   The General Assembly will consider the agenda item sometime next
month.
   U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, is seen by many
nations as a violation of the principle of non-interference and of
the June 17, 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice.
   The court, the central U.N. legal body, ruled against the United
States regarding U.S. military and financial aid to the Contras.
Under the U.N. Charter, all member states agree to abide by the
decisions of the World Court.
   But the United States often has ignored the court and its
rulings when they run counter to what Washington perceives to be
U.S. interests.
   This year's Nicaraguan resolution urgently demands full and
immediate U.S. compliance with the court ruling.
   The 159-nation General Assembly has overwhelmingly voted each
year since 1986 to support Nicaragua and uphold the World Court
ruling. The vote last year was 94-2, with 48 abstentions and the
remainder absent. The United States and Israel voted ``no.''

   Michael Dukakis, an underdog running short of time, accused
George Bush on Monday of resorting to ``outright lies'' to avoid
real issues. Bush replied that Democrats are desperate and said
Dukakis is soft on crime and defense ``and that's the inescapable
truth.''
   There was no letup in a White House campaign never noted for
civility.
   ``Hitler would have loved these people,'' Democratic Rep.
Richard Gephardt said of the Republicans as he campaigned for
Dukakis.
   With 15 days until Election Day, Bush and running mate Dan
Quayle were doing their best to protect a lead in the national
public opinion polls. Dukakis and ticketmate Lloyd Bentsen looked
for a way to catch fire _ however belatedly.
   ``Maybe with the benefit of hindsight, I should have tried to
respond earlier'' to Republican attacks, Dukakis said in an
appearance on the Larry King show on Cable News Network.
   When asked by King whether he had a ``good shot'' of winning,
Dukakis replied: ``I think we've got a shot.''
   Dukakis also said he was caught by surprise by the nature of
presidential campaigning after the Democratic National Convention,
and he said the furor over the selection of Quayle took away
attention from his campaign as well.
   ``I was campaigning but a lot of attention was devoted to the
(GOP) convention, and then there was about three weeks of deafening
noise about the Quayle selection, wich made it very difficult to
get through,'' he said.
   ``What you find out at the convention is that you're suddenly in
a very different world,'' he said. ``Who says what for 45 seconds
on the 6 o'clock news makes the difference in a particular day, and
it took a while to understand that.''
   He appeared to be doing his best to make up for lost time.
   For example, Dukakis told National Public Radio in an interview,
``I agree with'' Bentsen that the Republican campaign contained
elements of racism.
   And from a sparsely attended appearance in Los Angeles to a
speech before a throng of 10,000 in San Diego, Dukakis carried his
late-campaign populist theme through the nation's biggest state. He
said Bush would personally receive a $22,000-a-year tax break from
his proposal to cut the capital gains tax.
   ``George Bush wants to give people like George Bush a tax break
that's more than the average California worker makes in a year,''
Dukakis said in Los Angeles. ``Look in the mirror and ask yourself:
Is George Bush on your side.''
   Bush, at a rally in Williston, Vt., defended his tax proposal as
good for creating new jobs. He said Dukakis is likely to raise
taxes and the nation could face an ``economic disaster if the
liberals take over the White House.''
   Campaigning through New England, Bush made an unusual departure
from his prepared speech to reject Dukakis' charges of campaign
distortions and deceptions. He said he could document allegations
in television advertisements criticizing a Massachusetts prison
furlough program and his rival's record on defense.
   ``There are signs showing in the opposition camp of desperation
using ads that accuse us of lies ...,'' he said. ``The record on
the essential opposition _ the opposition to these military
programs is no lie. ... And he is upset, not because it's false,
but because he is weak on crime and defense. And that's the
inescapable truth.''
   The vice presidential candidates added their voices to the
rising chorus.
   Bentsen renewed his weekend claim that Republicans were guilty
of racist advertising, particularly in their attempts to depict
Dukakis as soft on crime.
   ``They are obviously dealing with a black man who, in that
instance, had raped a white woman, and that certainly came through
in the ad,'' he said of the case of Willie Horton, the
Massachusetts prisoner who escaped while on furlough and brutalized
a Maryland couple. Asked what came through, Bentsen said,
``racism.''
   Quayle rebutted that charge as ``totally absurd'' as he
campaigned in Missouri. ``I think it shows just how desperate they
really are to start fanning the fires of racism,'' he said.
   There was no disagreement about which side was ahead in the race.
   A fresh poll in Wisconsin showed the two men in a virtual tie, a
big gain for Bush from an earlier survey. Reliably Republican
Nebraska was running true to form in another survey that showed
Bush in the lead by 25 points.
   And in California where Dukakis was campaigning, Bush was ahead
11 points. The poll, prepared for Tuesday's editions of the Los
Angeles Times, showed Bush leading 53 percent tp 42 percent.
   The Times polled 1,376 registered voters during the fours days
that ended Sunday. The margin of error was four percentage points.
   With Congress adjourned for the year, the surrogate campaigners
were out in force, Gephardt included.
   ``This has really been a campaign that's practiced the politics
of illusion and delusion,'' the Missouri congressman said of the
Republicans, accusing them of ``half-truths and lies'' about
Dukakis.
   ``If the reality is not what you want, you rearrange it. Hitler
would have loved these people.''
   For the most part, the day's campaigning reflected Dukakis' hope
that the voters were ``ready to take a second look at George Bush
and me'' if given a reason.
   ``A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is
till putting on its shoes,'' the Democrat quoted Mark Twain. He
said Bush ``can't win an election where the real issues are
discussed.''
   But Bush said Dukakis was trying to deflect attention from the
Republican record of economic success.
   In Waterbury, Conn., he said Democrats ``contend that the
American people are rallying to our cause because we make better TV
ads. They miss the whole point. ... The American people have chosen
us to lead because of our principles, not personalities.''

   Hollywood Teamsters union leaders on Monday
discussed a tentative settlement to their 3-week-old strike, but
would not disclose details.
   Earl Bush, secretary-treasurer of the Hollywood drivers union,
met Monday with representatives of striking studio electricians and
laborers, and then went into a closed meeting.
   ``There's a news blackout on the negotiating committee,'' said
Jim McCabe, a Teamster business agent. ``All I can tell you is that
there have been meetings this morning, but at this point, no
settlement has been reached.''
   Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers, declined to comment.
   The all-day sessions followed weekend negotiations in Florida
between Teamster leaders and officials from the motion picture and
television industry. The talks produced a tentative settlement,
according to published reports.
   The Teamsters had threatened last week to spread the strike
across the country in an effort to stop all film and television
production.
   The possible settlement is subject to approval by North
Hollywood-based Teamsters Local 399, which represents 2,200
striking studio drivers, and the 1,000 members of the electricians
and laborers unions.
   The Teamster drivers transport actors, equipment and props for
television and film producers.
   Their strike started Oct. 3 after contract negotiations
collapsed over weekend work rules, salary rates, wages for
out-of-town film and television production, studio seniority and
guidelines for the making of non-union films. Some Teamster drivers
were being asked to take a pay cut from $16.61 to $14 per hour, as
producers said they faced competion from studios outside southern
California.

   Michael Dukakis said Monday that George
Bush's proposal to reduce capital gains taxes would present a
$22,000-a-year tax break to the Republican candidate himself.
   The Democratic nominee, pressing his assertion that a Bush
presidency would benefit the wealthiest Americans, said, ``George
Bush wants to give people like himself a tax break that's more, in
some cases, than the average worker in California makes in a year.''
   Dukakis campaigned the length of California during the day in a
bid for the state's most-in-the-nation 47 electoral votes. He also
waged an effort to battle back nationally through television
interviews and purchases of network air time.
   A new poll indicated he had his work cut out for him in that
state. The poll, prepared for Tuesday's editions of the Los Angeles
Times, showed Bush leading 53 percent tp 42 percent.
   The Times polled 1,376 registered voters during the fours days
that ended Sunday. The margin of error was four percentage points.
   In a speech to supporters at a half-filled Scottish Rite Temple
in Los Angeles, Dukakis renewed, in his sharpest terms yet, his
criticism of Bush's proposal to reduce the tax rate on capital
gains from a maximum of 33 percent to 15 percent. Dukakis says
capital gains _ profits gained from sales of property such as
stocks or real estate _ are primarily a concern of the wealthy, and
that Bush's proposal is a break for the rich.
   ``Consider a taxpayer who reported $515,132 in capital gains
over the last three years,'' Dukakis said. ``Suppose he reports the
same amount over the next three. If the vice president's new tax
plan is accepted, that taxpayer will get an annual tax break of
more than $22,000.
   ``And what's the name of that taxpayer? George Herbert Walker
Bush.''
   Dukakis aides said the Democrat reported no capital gains during
the past three years.
   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said when asked about
Dukakis' comments: ``We're going to stick to our agenda and we're
not going to worry about ankle-biting by the opposition.''
   Bush, in a speech delivered before Dukakis made his remarks,
said in Portland, Maine, ``I will push for a cut in the capital
gains tax for a very simple reason: It's not to favor the rich; it
will help create jobs.''
   He said, ``My opponent calls this typically a tax cut for the
rich. He's wrong. He's dead wrong.''
   Dukakis struck a populist note in California, saying repeatedly
that he was fighting for average people.
   The Massachusetts governor also pressed his contention that the
Bush campaign has distorted his record, recalling Mark Twain's line
that, ``A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth
is still putting on its shoes.''
   ``Mr. Bush must have read Mark Twain,'' Dukakis said, ``because
he's running a campaign based on distortions and distrations _ and
outright lies. Why? Because he can't win an election where the real
issues are discussed.''
   Later in San Diego, he repeated that theme as he spoke to a
crowd estimated by police at 10,000 people at Horton Plaza.
Spectators crowded elevated walkways and filled windows to catch a
glimpse.
   Dukakis shook hands along a sidewalk jammed with people, where
one enthusiastic woman outstretched her arm and stroked him on the
back of the head in a show of affection _ prompting Secret Service
agents to quickly move her arm away.
   ``We've seen a campaign of distortions and misrepresentation and
of outright lies now for many, many months,'' Dukakis told the
crowd in denouncing Republican campaigning.
   Dukakis was accompanied in his campaigning by actress Daryl
Hannah.
   After appearances in Los Angeles, Burbank and San Diego, Dukakis
had later appearances in the northern California cities of San
Francisco, Hayward and San Leandro.
   Aides said Dukakis would return next weekend to California, a
must-win state for him.
   Trailing in national polls, Dukakis said he believed American
voters were dissatisfied with the tenor of the campaign so far and
were ``ready to take a hard second look at George Bush and me.''
   He was trying to take his case to voters through television
interviews. He was appearing on the Larry King show Monday night,
in a segment taped two days earlier. On Tuesday night he was being
interviewed live on ABC's ``Nightline'' program for 90 minutes.
   On the Larry King show, Dukakkis said, ``Maybe with the benefit
of hindsight, I should have tried to respond earlier'' to the
negative ads. He said the message about what candidates would do
for the future has been obscured ``by ads about furloughs and
tanks.''
   On the question of likability, he said, ``You can be
passionately competent.''
   Press secretary Dayton Duncan said the Dukakis campaign had
purchased five minutes of time Tuesday night on NBC, and would have
another network appearance Sunday night and again the Saturday
before the election. Dukakis has purchased 30 minutes for election
eve on all three networks, Duncan said.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels raided four towns in
northern Colombia late Sunday and early Monday and blew up three
bridges to prevent army pursuit, Antioquia state Gov. Antonio
Roldan Betancur said.
   According to police, 13 guerrillas, one policeman and one
soldier were killed, he said.
   National police reported that a total of 400 guerrillas attacked
the four towns _ Turbo, Necocli, Saiza and Currulao _ within a few
hours, Roldan said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian
radio chain RCN.
   Guerrillas have attacked 24 towns and 33 government security
installations this year, the worst wave of rebel raids since the
guerrillas organized 25 years ago.
   An attack on Saiza on Aug. 23 killed 42 people _ 18 guerrillas,
12 civilians, 10 soldiers and two policemen.
   The governor said the latest attacks were made by the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces and the People's Liberation Army. He
called the raids in the north's banana-growing region an obvious
attempt to undermine parts of Colombia prior to a one-day general
strike declared for Thursday.
   Colombia's two largest labor unions _ the Workers' Unitary
Central and the General Confederation of Labor _ declared the
strike to protest the nation's 22 percent inflation, to demand a
price freeze and an increase in the minimum wage, and to try to
force government action against right-wing death squads.
   The army said last week it uncovered plans by Colombia's six
guerrilla groups to send armed rebels into the streets during the
strike and to blow up bridges, highways, communications facilities
and electric power lines Thursday.
   Colombia's last big general strike was in 1977, when 29 people
were killed when soldiers fired on rioters in Bogota.
   Death squads have killed about 900 people in the last two years,
including 180 labor unionists.
   The minimum wage in Colombia is about $90 a month. It usually is
adjusted once a year to compensate for inflation. The next
adjustment is due in January.

   Eight people were arrested Monday for
protesting outside a University of Wisconsin fraternity that was
suspended for holding a mock slave auction, complete with
black-painted faces and Afro wigs.
   ``Going to classes is a priority, but I'm willing to get
arrested for this,'' said protester Kris Hoeksema, 18.
   Demonstrators took turns chaining themselves to a bench outside
the Zeta Beta Tau house and being removed by police. They vowed to
return until the fraternity is ousted from the campus.
   The school's Interfraternity Council said Monday Zeta Beta Tau
was suspended indefinitely from social, athletic and other events
pending the outcome of an investigation.
   Assistant Dean of Students Roger Howard said the auction was
held Thursday night. He said the participants ``would put on skits
and then the pledges would be put on auction for the sale of their
services.''
   Efforts to contact the fraternity for a comment Monday were
unsuccessful because members were not answering the telephone or
their door.
   Madison police said the protesters were cited for unlawful
trespass on fraternity property and were released. Such citations
carry fines of $150.

   Five bodies have been recovered from
the shattered remains of the offshore oil rig Piper Alpha that sank
in the North Atlantic last July leaving 112 people missing, police
reported Monday.
   They were the first bodies to be found in the huge, four-story
living section of the rig that caught fire and exploded on July 6,
claiming 167 lives.
   It is believed many of the 107 workers still listed as missing
will be found in the accomodations section of the platform that was
retrieved during a massive salvage operation. Barges and cranes
salvaged the section and transported it to the Orkney Islands off
of Scotland's northern tip.
   The five bodies were found Sunday but have not been identified,
a police spokesman in Aberdeen said.
   The rig's dormitory section, welded to a barge, arrived Saturday
at an oil terminal of the platform's operator, Occidental Petroleum
Corp.
   There, in shallow water, 40 police officers began searching and
found the five bodies, according to the spokesman. He declined to
comment when asked if other bodies had been found Monday.
   Occidental spokesman Alex Blake-Milton issued a statement saying
work was continuing at the site of the tragedy, 120 miles off the
northeastern coast of Scotland, to strengthen the remains of the
platform to ensure safe passage for ships.

<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen, stumping in Gerald Ford's old
congressional district, attacked what he called ``racist''
Republican advertising Monday as appealing to the lowest instincts
of the electorate.
   The Texas senator also told local businesmen that sticking with
GOP policies was not good enough in a changing world that includes
a ``decline of the Russian empire.''
   On Sunday, Bentsen agreed in response to a question by a TV
interviewer that the Bush campaign was making a racist appeal in
its attacks on Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis as being soft on
crime.
   Talking to reporters Monday, Bentsen cited the GOP's focus on
the case of convicted murderer Willie Horton Jr., who raped a
Maryland woman and slashed her fiance last year after Horton had
escaped from a Massachusetts prison furlough.
   ``They are obviously dealing with a black man who, in that
instance, had raped a white woman, and that certainly came through
in the ad,'' said Bentsen. Asked what came through, he replied
``racism.''
   And in Little Rock, Ark., Monday night, Bentsen told a black
congregation at the Greater Paradise Baptist Church that the
Republicans ``bear false witness against Michael Dukakis and we're
gong to set that record straight.''
   ``The truth is catching up,'' he said. ``And the power of the
truth will prevail,'' he said.
   Bentsen did not mention the issue of race, but he received an
enthusiastic welcome from the congregation. The church resonated
from the voices of two choirs and Bentsen joined in for a rousing
rendition of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
   Bishop L.T. Walker, a visiting preacher who presided over the
rally, told the proverb about how for the want of a nail, a battle
was lost. ``The Duke can ride with Lloyd Bentsen at his side,'' he
concluded.
   In a speech before the Grand Rapids Economic Club, Bentsen said
the Democrats recognized the tough international competition
American business faces today.
   With new products coming to the market, such as high-definition
television, Japanese and European industries are cooperating but
American businesses are operating on their own, he said.
   Complicating that situation, he said, ``I think we're going to
see a continuation of the decline of the Russian empire'' which
must be handled with caution.
   He and Dukakis would offer ``a creative partnership'' between
business and government, ``not an industrial policy,'' Bentsen said.
   Asked by reporters to elaborate on his statement about the
Soviets, Bentsen said, ``We see their economy in a shambles and
people demanding something be done about the standard of living and
that they have a reasonable amount of consumer goods.''
   ``You see them backing off around the world. And you see the
American economic system being adopted more and more in other
countries. You're seeing a serious decline setting in on the
Russian empire,'' he said.
   ``We have to handle that with considerable care,'' he added.
``There is a tendency when one is going into a decline for the
military to strike out. It's important that we keep our defenses
strong during that process.''
   Bentsen received a polite reception from the Michigan luncheon
crowd, in the Republican Western part of the state. Democrats are
trailing in the race for Michigan's 20 electoral votes by some 7 to
9 points in recent polls and it's one of the states in which they
hope to stage a comeback.
   From Grand Rapids, Bentsen flew to Cape Girardeau, Mo., where he
toured a clothing factory. He viewed computer-operated cutting and
plotting machines that aid in the manufacture of men's suit coats
and blazers, and then addressed employees.
   Bentsen did not mention the racism charges in his address, but
referred to the furlough program as one of many ``distortions'' the
Republicans were peddling.

<HEAD>Christian Cabinet Chief Calls Syria an Occupying Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads the Christian
Cabinet in Lebanon's rival governments, said Monday that Syria's
refusal to recognize him makes it ``an occupation power.''
   Police reported three people killed and four wounded Monday in
sporadic exchanges of mortar and gunfire between Moslem Druse
militiamen and Christian units of the army in the hills overlooking
Beirut.
   The victims were civilians apparently caught in the crossfire in
Aley, near the hilltop town of Souk el-Gharb, seven miles southeast
of Beirut.
   On Saturday, two people were killed and four wounded in a
three-hour clash in the same area.
   Fears have risen that Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war between
Christians and Moslems would flare up as a constitutional crisis
deepened sectarian divisions, threatening to split Lebanon into
ministates.
   ``Syria's failure to recognize the constitutional Cabinet means
it does not recognize Lebanon's Constitution, which further means
that Syria has declared itself as an occupation power,'' Aoun told
reporters.
   Aoun, 52, a Maronite Catholic, was named by former President
Amin Gemayel to head an interim military Cabinet just minutes
before Gemayel's six-year term ended on Sept. 22. Parliament had
failed to elect a new head of state to succeed Gemayel.
   Moslems and leftists allied with Syria have rejected Aoun's
Cabinet and pledged allegiance to acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss,
who heads what was left of the government installed during
Gemayel's term.
   Syria, which has 40,000 troops stationed in 70 percent of
Lebanon's 4,035-square-mile territory, has branded Aoun a
``military usurper of power.''
   ``Syria has no right whatsoever to reject the Cabinet,'' Aoun
said.
   ``As a neighboring country, it has the right to withhold support
and even to be in dispute with the Cabinet. But to withhold
recognition is a different matter of grave seriousness.''
   Iraq, Syria's archrival in the Arab world, called on the Arab
League Monday to ensure that Lebanon's Parliament meets to elect a
new president and end the constitutional crisis.
   Christian deputies have boycotted parliamentary sessions, and no
president from among the Syrian-backed candidates, the main
contenders, could be chosen without a quorum.
   In a statement broadcast by Baghdad Radio, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tareq Aziz called action by Parliament ``imperative ... in
order to elect a new president for this Arab country.''
   His statement followed a report by the Christian Voice of
Lebanon radio that the United Arab Emirates asked the Arab League
to convene an emergency summit to discuss the Lebanese crisis.
   Under an unwritten covenant dating from Lebanon's independence
from France in 1943, the presidency goes to the Maronites, the
premiership to Sunni and the speakership of Parliament to Shiite
Moslems.
   Iraq has recognized Aoun's Cabinet. It is the only country to
have done so in a move clearly designed to antagonize Damascus.
   It has also armed the Christians' main militia, the Lebanese
Forces, which opposes Syria.

   The five astronauts who flew Discovery
on the first post-Challenger space shuttle flight were honored
Monday by several thousand people who applauded them along a
five-mile motorcade route.
   Cocoa Beach is just south of the Kennedy Space Center and is
home for many of the workers who helped launch Discovery there on
Sept. 29.
   Astronauts Frederick H. Hauck, Richard O. Covey, George D.
Nelson, John M. Lounge and David C. Hilmers flew to Patrick Air
Force Base from their training base in Houston and climbed into
convertible cars for the motorcade.
   Along the route the astronauts were greeted by high school
bands, congratulatory signs, American flags and rounds of applause.
Hundreds of green ribbons, the community's ``green for go'' symbol
for the mission, were visible.
   The motorcade ended at a Cocoa Beach motel, where a $25-a-plate
dinner featured a film with highlights of the four-day journey that
returned Americans to space 32 months after the Challenger disaster.
   In the 1960s, Cocoa Beach regularly held parades for astronauts
who returned from space flights. But the one Monday was the first
one since the Apollo 12 moon landing crew was honored in 1970.
   Workers at the Kennedy Space Center on Monday were joining the
space shuttle Atlantis to its two solid fuel booster rockets and
external fuel tank, preparing it for a launch in late November with
a classified Defense Department satellite.

   Typhoon Ruby roared past Manila early
Tuesday and pounded the agricultural heartland of central Luzon
island with winds gusting up to 140 mph and torrential rains,
officials said.
   The news media and other sources reported at least 18 people
killed, scores missing and about 47,000 homeless.
   A shipping company executive said a missing passenger ferry with
nearly 500 people aboard was reported safe at a small island in the
storm-swept Visayan Sea.
   Edgar Go, vice president of Sulpicio Lines, said another vessel
radioed that it had seen the passenger ship Dona Marilyn near
Masbate island, 300 miles southeast of Manila, and all of the
passengers and crew were safe.
   But Carlos Go, general manager of the Sulpicio Lines that
operates the Dona Marilyn, said later that a vessel sent to the
area to confirm the report radioed that it had been unable to
locate the passenger craft. He said the search was continuing.
   The Dona Marilyn crew reported engine trouble Monday while en
route from Manila to Tacloban City and said the ship was listing in
stormy seas.
   Rodrigo Roldan, civil defense director on Panay Island, said at
least five people were killed Monday when a wind-blown bus careened
off a bridge and plunged into a river.
   He said 18 people, including the driver, were rescued but as
many as 38 passengers were missing.
   Simeon Licayan, executive secretary of Cagayan de Oro, said
seven people were killed Sunday when tornados spawned by the
advancing typhoon struck remote villages near the city 500 miles
south of Manila.
   The Philippines News Agency reported six people perished when
floods washed away their homes near Pagadian City, 500 miles south
of Manila. The Philippine Red Cross confirmed one death there.
   The government weather service said Ruby's center passed about
50 miles east of Manila early Tuesday and slashed into the farming
provinces of Tarlac and Nueva Ecija.
   Tuesday morning the storm weakened slightly but still had winds
of 102 mph as it moved about 20 miles east of the huge U.S.-run
Clark Air Base 50 miles north of Manila, according to the weather
service.
   U.S. Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at the air base, said the
storm blew down a number of large trees as it passed.
   He said the extent of damage to the base facilities had not been
determined, but aircraft that could not be sheltered had been moved
to an undisclosed ``safe location.''
   Schools were closed at Clark and the U.S.-operated Subic Navy
Base and the American armed forces television network said only
``mission-essential personnel'' were on duty at U.S. military
facilities.
   In Manila all mayor banks and the city's two stock markets
suspended operations Tuesday.
   There were power outages and scattered flooding throughout the
capital.
   Some commercial flights were canceled and schools were closed in
Manila.
   ``This is one of the worst typhoons this year,'' said Juanito
Lirios, deputy weather service director, just before the storm
swept by Manila. ``If we do not take care there could be a great
loss of lives.''
   Ruby is the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to hit the
Philippines this year and the second in four days.
   The government's Department of Social Welfare said at least
47,000 people were left homeless in the storm ravaged areas.

<HEAD>Court Appointed Doctor: Harry Helmsley Has Memory Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court-appointed doctor has concluded that
billionaire real estate magnate Harry B. Helmsley has memory and
reasoning problems that would impair his standing trial on tax
evasion charges, it was disclosed Monday.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker, who revealed the doctor's
findings at a pretrial hearing, said he would determine the
79-year-old Helmsley's fitness to stand trial at another hearing in
December.
   Helmsley and his wife, Leona, 67, were indicted April 15 on
state and federal charges of evading taxes on almost $4 million in
income by passing it off as business expenses.
   Helmsley's lawyers have contended he was unfit to stand trial
because of memory problems and they are seeking to have him severed
from the case. Four of five medical experts who have examined him
have concurred that his memory is impaired, according to court
papers.
   Walker appointed Dr. Martin L. Albert, professor of neurology at
Boston University's School of Medicine, to examine Helmsley.
   Walker revealed Albert's conclusion that Helmsley ``could not
substantially assist in his defense'' because of ``memory
difficulties and difficulties in reasoning and difficulties in
problem solving in new and rapidly shifting settings.''
   Among other things, Albert concluded, Helmsley would ``not be
cognitively fit to respond to a hostile cross examination.''
   At the request of prosecutors, Walker said he would hold a
hearing on Helmsley's fitness to stand trial Dec. 19.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita said that if Walker found
by ``a preponderance of the evidence'' that Helmsley was unable to
assist his own defense ``the government would not object'' to
removing the aging billionaire from the trial.
   Walker also rescheduled the trial's start from Jan. 16 to Jan.
23.
   Helmsley and his 67-year-old wife are charged with disguising $4
million in renovations to their Greenwich, Conn. mansion as
business expenses and taking bogus tax deductions.

   George Bush was hoping to distract Michael Dukakis in New
England while the Massachusetts governor went after California's
bounty of 47 electoral votes and his supporters claimed GOP
campaign tactics were tinged with racism.
   The vice president began 15 days of nonstop campaigning today
with a trip to Waterbury, Conn., Portland, Maine, and Burlington,
Vt.
   Although the states are relatively poor in electoral votes, Bush
campaign officials say he leads in all three states and his
presence in the Northeast will force Dukakis to devote time and
resources in an area that should otherwise belong to him. ``We're
taking his base away from him,'' said Bush spokesman Mark Goodin.

behind a lengthy list of unfinished business ranging from cleaning

Byrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues near the end of the session.
``The 101st Congress has some formidable challenges to address.''

   In Nicaragua, the storm killed at least 50 people and left

the animals to open water.
   ``We're having a net built right now'' to carry them, David

   He emphasized that an airlift was the least preferred

   The Reagan administration, smarting from its
long and tragic involvement in Lebanon, is treading softly through
the maze of Lebanese politics with a nervous eye on the country's
creeping partition.
   U.S. diplomacy is essentially in a holding pattern designed to
prevent Lebanon's disintegration, at least until the next U.S.
administration takes over and decides whether to continue American
involvement or to pull out.
   ``We want to do nothing that will nudge that country into
partitions,'' said Richard Murphy, the assistant secretary of state
who has dealt with Lebanon in recent years.

   Nearly 500 years after Copernicus postulated that
Earth revolves around the sun, millions of Americans think
otherwise, suggests a poll that found vast numbers of the nation's
adults ``scientifically illiterate.''
   Many Americans also mistakenly believe that laser beams are
focused sound waves and that atoms are smaller than electrons, said
Jon Miller, director of the Public Opinion Laboratory at Northern
Illinois University, who conducted a nationwide survey for the
National Science Foundation.
   In a July telephone survey, 2,041 adults 18 or older were asked
about 75 questions on basic science, Miller said. The survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Asked whether
the Earth goes around the sun or the sun around the Earth, 21
percent replied incorrectly. Seven percent said they didn't know.

   A U.S. commission looking to close
obsolete military bases may be about to play taps for Fort Douglas,
and politicians say they may be ready to surrender the post built
in 1862 to protect stagecoach routes.
   Members of Utah's congressional delegation consider the
picturesque fort and its Civil War-era buildings a likely target in
the Pentagon's quest to shut about two dozen bases. They say
they'll have to acquiesce if it can be shown that the move would
save money, but some are skeptical that any real savings can be had.
   ``Our main concern is that they operate from up-to-date,
accurate data,'' said Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens, whose district
includes the fort.

<HEAD>No Easy Way to Judge Airline Safety</HEAD>

   Some consumer advocates have been asking the
government to take its monthly reports comparing airline on-time
performance another step and issue a comparison on how each airline
ranks on safety.
   The idea may sound fine at first blush, but is complicated by
the fact that the Transportation Department and its Federal
Aviation Administration have yet to figure out what indicators give
an accurate reading on safety.
   The FAA earlier this year hired the Flight Safety Foundation, a
private consulting firm, to develop some criteria that might be
used to gauge aviation safety.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said he wanted a ``kind of Dow
Jones index of safety'' to tell whether the airways actually are
becoming more or less safe.
   The consultants are going beyond raw accident statistics and
rates. They are examining air traffic controller errors,
near-collision reports, runway incidents, among other things.
   But FAA officials suggest even when the index is found it's
unlikely any attempt will be made to use it to rank airlines on the
basis of safety.
   Such a move would likely be vigorously opposed by the airlines.
   ``It doesn't make much sense,'' says Bill Jackman, a spokesman
for the Air Transport Association. He said it would be difficult,
if not impossible, to compare on safety grounds airlines that fly
in vastly different weather and air traffic conditions.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, earlier this year was asked to examine whether the
government should develop an airline ranking system based on safety.
   While such a ranking might be desirable, the GAO said it could
``not find any performance indicators that are currently usable to
compare objectively the safety levels of individual airlines.''
   It said that there is some agreement among aviation safety
experts that such areas as pilot competence, quality of maintenance
and financial stablility as well as ``management attitude'' toward
compliance with federal regulations could be used in comparing the
airlines' safety record.
   But it said neither the FAA nor its parent Transportation
Department has enough such information available to be of use.

   Upward pressure on rents is likely to occur in
the near future, and if that is so you may expect a rise in demands
for rent controls.
   One without the other has been rare in recent years, and nothing
seems likely to change that relationship. Some people will always
be for rent control and others will oppose it; seldom can they
speak civilly to each other.
   The usual fireworks may be expected, therefore, as pressure
builds on the rental market, a consequence of reduced tax benefits
for owners and builders and a proliferation of local restrictions
on new construction.
   Recognizing the emerging situation, the non-profit,
independent-minded Urban Land Institute commissioned an
``evaluation'' by Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution. He comes down hard against controls.
   Downs contends in his recently released volume that controls
inhibit new rental construction, cause existing units to
deteriorate faster, and actually impose disadvantages on those who
are thought to benefit.
   It is a conventional finding and it is likely to be treated
conventionally by those opposed philosophically or morally to
free-market rents.
   Its impact is likely to be diminished even further be its
sponsorhip, which includes the National Multi Housing Council, the
Building Owners and Managers Association International and the
National Association of Realtors.
   Nevertheless, it has much to say about the subject that is
worthwhile, especially in view of the likelihood that reductions in
rental construction, plus a tendency toward rent inflation, will
resurrect the debate.
   Though the subject lies dormant now, there are more than 200
communities with some form of residential rent controls, most
adopted during periods of rapid general inflation in the 1970s, and
most in the Northeast and California.
   Do they work? For some and for a limited time, it seems. But
Downs contends that in the long run they impose two major
disadvantages upon those who are supposed to be the major
beneficiaries _ low-income households.
   First, he says, controls increase rather than decrease the
discretionary power of owners by intensifying tenant competition
for vacant units.
   Says Downs: Owners then tend to choose higher-income tenants
over poor ones since the former pose less risk. Owners also
discriminate against tenants on the basis of race, ethnicity, age
and number of children.
   Then, he contends, controls may increase homelessness by
reducing the available supply of rental housing, and thus the
access of the poor to that supply.
   These contentions are likely to play a big role in the arguments
to come because already there is a serious shortage of low-income
housing.
   According to Downs, in 1983 the number of renter households for
whom $250 or less represented 30 percent of income was 12 million.
At the same time, the number of units priced at $250 or less per
month was 8.75 million.
   Harsh as that reality was, it has grown worse since then, says
Downs, and that brings up the question of how to handle the
problem. By imposing rent controls to temporarily assist while
worsening the long-term problem? Or, by allowing free-market rents,
which eventually bring more units on market?
   Philosophically, there is probably no meeting ground for those
at the extremes of this argument, no more than there is a common
interest regarding another aspect of the subject, i.e., the fate of
landlords.
   Rent controls obviously impose economic losses upon the owners
of rental housing units _ penalties that no other participants in
the economic community are expected to accept.
   Owners of controlled units, for instance, may be forced to take
operating expenses from their own pockets, in effect denying their
own families. The market value of the property declines. Their
investment can even be wiped out.
   Landlords legitimately ask, therefore, if attempts at fair play
for one member of society should arbitarily be at the expense of
another, rather than of the total community?

<HEAD>Valerie Bertinelli Plays Aviator Pancho Barnes</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Valerie Bertinelli had to learn more
than just her lines to portray aviation pioneer Pancho Barnes.
   Barnes was at home not only in the cockpit of an open stunt
plane but also in the saddle atop galloping horses.
   ``I'd ridden horses a long time ago, but I was always scared and
never knew how to ride well,'' said Bertinelli. And she had never
been up in a small plane.
   Prior to beginning her role in the three-hour movie ``Pancho
Barnes,'' on CBS tonight, Bertinelli went to the Texas location
site a week early. She wanted to practice horseback riding and to
become acquainted with open-cockpit planes.
   ``I spent a lot of time with the wranglers,'' she said. ``I
really enjoy riding now. I was afraid of the horse at first, but I
spent every weekend during the shoot riding. The last week I was
able to able to do my own stunt of riding the horse in a race next
to the camera car.''
   She also took her first ride in a small plane. ``I couldn't wait
to get up,'' she said. ``When I got to the airfield the pilot was
doing loops and stalls. It looked like fun. When he landed I had
him take me up right away. It was such an experience. I was so
exhilarated.''
   The movie also stars Sam Robards, Ted Wass, James Stephens,
Geoffrey Lewis, Cynthia Harris and Richard Young. It was filmed on
location near Dallas.
   The beautiful Bertinelli was an odd choice to play Barnes, whom
test pilot Chuck Yeager described in his autobiography as ``one of
the ugliest women'' he had ever met.
   Pancho Barnes is probably best known today as the woman who ran
the watering hole with the wall of photos of dead test pilots in
the movie ``The Right Stuff.'' Kim Stanley played her in that 1983
movie. But Barnes was also an early pilot who competed in women's
cross-country air races with Amelia Earhart and Beryl Markham. She
organized the Stunt Pilots Association, which performs movie
stunts. She trained pilots in World War II, and her ranch later
became part of Edwards Air Force Base.
   The movie starts with her introduction to flight in her
grandfather's hot-air balloon. He was Professor Thaddeus S.C. Lowe,
who was appointed by Abraham Lincoln to head the Union Army's
balloon corps in the Civil War. She shunned more traditional
feminine pastimes for horseback riding and flying.
   ``She was a woman before her time, '' said Bertinelli. ``She led
her own life. She was one of the guys. She was respected in her
circle.''
   The movie romanticizes Barnes. It mentions only two marriages,
although Barnes had four husbands. She married her fourth husband,
Gene ``Mac'' McKendry (Sam Robards), after World War II, when he
was 26 and she was in her mid-40s. In the film, however, they meet
and marry in the 1920s. They were divorced in 1968. She died in
1975.
   Bertinelli, who starred as the kid sister in ``One Day at a
Time,'' was last seen in the miniseries ``I'll Take Manhattan.''
   ``I've just been taking it easy and keeping my eyes open,'' she
said. ``I don't want to rush into anything. I'm going on the road
with my husband (rock musician Eddie Van Halen) until Thanksgiving
and Christmas. I don't think I'll do anything new until next year.''
   Bertinelli has a series commitment from CBS, but has not yet
decided on the concept of the new show. ``A script's being
written,'' she said, ``but you never know how it's going to turn
out. I want to be very sure before I commit to it.''
   Several movies and miniseries are being written for her
production company.
   ``The parts get better as you get older,'' said Bertinelli. ``I
enjoy being 28. I don't look 28, but I don't look 19 either. I'm
not going to play teen-agers anymore. They're not as interesting.''

<HEAD>Secrecy is Routine and Pervasive in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secrecy is a part of life in
South Africa, extending far beyond national security to corporate
boardrooms, athletic fields, even cooking contests and a zoo
director's office.
   Because of the stigma attached abroad to dealings with South
Africa, leaders in government, business, entertainment and sports
consider clandestine tactics necessary.
   An editorial in Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper, said the
National Party government engages in ``a systematic concealment of
the truth from the public. The idea of simple public accountability
has decayed so far that not only invasions, but even the salaries
of public servants are concealed.''
   Base salaries of officials are disclosed but extensive
allowances for homes, travel, cars and other expenses are not.
   Peter Soal, a member of Parliament for the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party, declared it ``impossible for the average
citizen to keep abreast of what's going on.''
   This penchant for secrets reaches high levels. Foreign Minister
Roelof F. Botha peeled off for two days during a visit to Europe
with President P.W. Botha, who is not related.
   ``I am not prepared to say publicly exactly where I was, except
to say I visited one or two countries in the East or in Africa,''
he said after rejoining the presidential party.
   The government, controlled by the white minority, claims several
statesmen from black Africa have paid clandestine visits to South
Africa in recent years.
   Officials also say prominent blacks in South Africa have
negotiated secretly with the government about possible political
reforms, but that identifying them might discredit those leaders in
the eyes of other blacks.
   Much of the nation's foreign trade is enveloped in secrecy,
particularly when it involves efforts to circumvent economic
sanctions. The government says South Africa trades with 40 of the
50 other African countries, but refuses to name them.
   Statistics on arms imports and exports are secret, as is most
information about energy and the nuclear program..
   South Africa does not say how much oil it consumes or where it
comes from. Disclosing information on how petroleum is obtained has
been made a crime to protect those supplying oil in violation of a
U.N. embargo.
   The Defense Act prohibits unauthorized reports about the
composition and activities of the armed forces. Statistics on draft
resistance are not revealed and past incursions into Angola have
been kept secret.
   South Africa did not confirm its renewed presence in Angola last
year until many weeks after large numbers of troops crossed the
border. Military headquarters did not issue comprehensive
statistics on casualties among its black troops involved in the
campaign.
   Members of Parliament have the right to ask Cabinet ministers
for information and statistics that might not be disclosed
otherwise, but ministers often refuse to respond on grounds
disclosure would not be in the national interest.
   ``That answer has become more prevalent lately,'' Soal said in
an interview. ``The Nationalists have a passion for secrecy.''
   Emergency regulations forbid unauthorized reports about
detainees or action by security forces. Justice Minister Kobie
Coetzee recently proposed restricting news reports of trials.
   Because of the extensive international sports boycott, foreign
athletes sometimes arrive using pseudonyms. Occasionally, with the
cooperation of South African media, teams compete without their
nationality or the names of the players being disclosed.
   On many occasions the locations of sports events are not
announced until foreign competitors are en route to South Africa
and thus less susceptible to last-minute political pressure.
   Even non-sports competitions can assume a cloak-and-dagger
aspect. The departure of four young South African chefs for an
international cooking contest this month was kept secret until the
eve of their departure.
   A white tiger arrived at the Pretoria Zoo in early October in a
trade with an American zoo, which received a king cheetah. Zoo
director Willie Labuschagne said the zoo in the United States asked
not to be identified.
   Foreign film crews produce movies here secretly. They like the
relatively low production costs but want to avoid international
publicity about the choice of locale.
   The Star, the largest-selling daily newspaper, recently
editorialized on the extent of secrecy and concluded: ``It will be
nice, one day, to shout from the rooftops again.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the early 1970s, the fiercely independent
old-timers of the Florida Keys, who call themselves Conchs, started
a tongue-in-cheek secession move to establish the Conch Republic.
Some wish today they had seceded. With booming development has come
more stringent government controls over land use and the Keys are
divided into warring camps.

   Four decades ago, Betty Brothers
bought a bug-infested swamp between the Atlantic Ocean and U.S.
Route 1 where she set up camp, cooked over an open fire, and went
to work with dynamite.
   ``It was a big swamp. It was acreage,'' says the 69-year-old
real estate agent, whose pet bottlenose dolphin Suwa swims in a
gated lagoon next to the house which stands on the site today. ``It
was all under water so we camped, dynamited and filled it.''
   Ms. Brothers knows she wouldn't be allowed to build her dream
house today. Progress has brought federal dredge-and-fill laws, the
Clean Water Act, and a state-mandated land-use plan that has
agitated just about everyone on the 112-mile island chain ending at
Key West, the southernmost point in the contintental United States.
   ``If I went with a 5-gallon bucket of sand or rocks and dumped
it in my bay bottom, what do you suppose could happen to me?'' the
white-haired Ms. Brothers asks with a chuckle. Technically, she
could face federal charges.
   The Keys were an inspiration to Ernest Hemingway, Margaritaville
to Jimmy Buffett, a home to endangered species from the American
crocodile to Key deer and a launch point to the only living coral
reef in the continental United States with its world-class
sport-fishing, scuba diving and snorkeling.
   The natives, a fiercely independent lot that call themselves
Conchs, organized a tongue-in-cheek secession move in the early
1970s to establish the Conch Republic. Many of them were only half
kidding.
   The Monroe County land-use plan is at the center of a dispute
between pro-development and preservation forces and has strained
relations between the county and the state. Ironically, it has also
spurred a construction boom.
   ``They've got more problems per square inch than any people I've
run into,'' says Rep. Dante Fascell of Miami, noting problems with
the water supply, sewage disposal and waste management on the
skinny island chain.
   ``Are you going to allow unrestricted housing and development?
The county, it seems to me, is beginning to say no. There's a
greater sensitivity now among the people making the decisions that
they want to preserve what's there.''
   But County Commissioner John Stormont, often the minority of one
on development votes, charges that ``under growth management, we
have not managed growth.''
   ``The Keys historically has never been able to take care of
itself,'' he says. ``It adopted strong regulations and then ignored
them.''
   Even with the land-use plan in place, the value of new
construction was up 59 percent for the nine months ending in June,
compared to the same period last year, Stormont says.
   ``If they had never said we're going to have all this
management, you would have gone 15 years without seeing the spurt
of development we've had in the last two years,'' says Ms.
Brothers, who moved from Ohio in 1946.
   County planning director Donald Craig acknowledges that Key
Largo has seen a spate of commercial and hotel development, Big
Pine Key has developed rapidly, and Big Coppitt Key is becoming a
bedroom community for Key West.
   Ed Swift, a county commissioner when the land-use plan was
adopted in September 1986, noted initial planning would have
allowed 70,000 new housing units in the county of 74,500 people,
but the plan reduced that to 16,000 units by the year 2020. That
means the population could grow by roughly 60 percent.
   ``It's a very emotional issue,'' says Swift, a native of St.
Louis who has become a leading Key West businessman.
   Consider these recent events:
   _ A federal jury ruled in July that a Key West developer
illegally filled 2.7 acres of wetlands to build town houses in a
major test of Corps of Engineers authority.
   _ The county wants to pave a dirt road parallel to U.S. 1 on Big
Pine Key, the refuge for Key deer, to improve local access between
residential areas and the business district, but the state objects.
   _ Port Bougainville, once envisioned as the largest resort
between Miami and Key West, went into bankruptcy and the state has
pledged to spend $23 million on the North Key Largo site, property
that environmentalists consider a natural extension of the
Everglades.

   ``Forty years ago, you could do anything you pleased anywhere,''
says Key Largo attorney Jim Mattson, one of four defense attorneys
in the federal dredge trial. ``The state of Florida didn't even
have any regulatory role until the early '70s. This was a nation
unto itself down here.''
   Mattson, a transplant from Washington, D.C., estimates that he
has 15 to 20 clients with $20 million worth of property challenging
land-use restrictions as illegal condemnations.
   One thorny issue is the contiguous lot rule, which bars a person
who owns two adjacent residential parcels from building on both.
One house is the limit for the two parcels.
   ``We're looking at a lot of lawsuits for Christmas presents for
Monroe County,'' Mattson says.
   Meanwhile, the county is fighting state efforts to supervise
growth control.
   Tom Pelham, director of the state Department of Community
Affairs, which administers the land-use plan, is a favorite target.
   ``The only difference between Tom Pelham and Nero is Nero had a
fiddle,'' says retiring County Attorney Lucien Proby, a
Mississippian who bought his first Keys property in 1970. ``Mr.
Pelham has for some reason taken it upon himself to assume that his
position as director of the DCA has given him imperial rights over
Monroe County.''
   Pelham dismisses the state-county battles as mostly political
saber-rattling.
   ``Everyone has to recognize that the Keys have very natural
limitations on the amount of development that can be
accommodated,'' he says. ``There is only one Keys. It's something
that should be protected and preserved, and the state has deemed it
a resource of state significance.''
   But county commissioners in August authorized attorney David
Paul Horan to file suit challenging what the county contends is the
state's administrative veto authority over land-use changes.
   ``This plan completely and arbitrarily rezoned the entire
county, and many people suffered because of it,'' says county Mayor
Gene Lytton, who was elected to the county commission after the
land-use plan was passed. He now votes with the majority as part of
what environmentalists call the Concrete Coalition.
   ``Monroe County likes to consider itself beyond Tallahassee's
control,'' says former County Commissioner Alison Fahrer, who was
defeated in her re-election bid when Lytton was elected two years
ago. ``I think this place can become kind of a scary place for the
people who like to live like outlaws and pollute their water.''
   Gilbert Voss, a University of Miami biological oceanographer and
an expert on the Keys' reefs, has written a survey for the Friends
of the Everglades.
   ``Wherever reefs occur, the reefs are deteriorating,'' Voss
concludes in the survey. ``The worst thing that can happen to a
virgin coral reef today is to tell about it in a tour magazine or
diving periodical.''
   Cullen Chambers, a former state park ranger and now director of
Key West's Lighthouse Museum, voices a common concern.
   ``People were attracted to Key West because it is a bit of the
Caribbean with the protection of the United States,'' he says. ``We
virtually destroy the very thing that brought people here to begin
with. It's almost a cliche but it's true.''
   Charles Lee, senior vice president of the Florida Audubon
Society, says he has ``absolutely no faith'' in Monroe County
government.
   ``They are determined to make it as easy as they can to let
developers do pretty much whatever they want,'' he says. ``There's
always going to have to be a state presence to make sure the
resources are not frittered away.''
   Ed Kloski, a contractor on the county planning commission, still
sees trouble ahead.
   ``We haven't grown up enough,'' he says. ``One of the county
planners told me we're going to take Monroe County kicking and
screaming into the 20th century. The problem is we're coming from
the 17th century.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Women have been eating dirt down through the
centuries in most major cultural groups. Plato was the first to
mention in writing that Greek women were consuming soil. The
practice was common in Africa and the custom was brought to this
country by slaves. Among a small group of women in the rural South
it's still a habit hard to break.

   Onece Johnson tried hard to kick the
habit. She took up smoking. She began eating laundry starch as a
substitute. But the old craving still lingered.
   Johnson has to have a daily fix of dirt, particularly her
favorite crunchy clay.
   The 38-year-old woman is one of a dwindling number of clay
eaters in America, perpetuating an African custom brought to this
country by black slaves.
   ``I've tried to wean myself away from it,'' says Johnson,
showing a visitor the site of the best-tasting dirt in her native
Holmes County on the edge of the Mississippi Delta. ``On a daily
average, I'd say I'd eat a tablespoonful, just enough to get a
taste in my mouth, like pinching tobacco.''
   An authority on dirt-eating is Dr. Dennis Frate, a medical
anthropologist and program director of the University of
Mississippi's Rural Health Research Program in nearby Goodman.
   ``It's analogous to eating potato chips,'' Frate says. ``A snack
food is what it is.''
   Johnson, a staff member at the state's Shelter Workshop for the
Handicapped in Lexington, says dirt tastes like...well, dirt.
   ``It really doesn't have a significant taste,'' she says. ``You
know when it rains how the earth smells. It tastes to me similar to
what it smells like.''
   Frate conducted a study in 1971 that found that one out of four
adult women in Holmes County ate dirt regularly. He said
dirt-eating has been reported throughout the South, though he knows
of no recent studies.
   For unknown reasons, Frate says, few men eat dirt in America,
while both men and women eat dirt pellets sold today in the markets
of West Africa.
   Although there is a slight risk of ingesting parasites or
impacting the colon with large amounts of clay, Frate says the
practice generally isn't harmful to the eater's health.
   Frate conducted a follow-up study of dirt eaters four years ago,
which was published by the New York Academy of Sciences. The study
showed that most Holmes County dirt eaters had switched to
potentially harmful substitutes such as laundry starch or baking
soda, which have a texture similar to the dirt.
   He says the substitutes are particulary threatening because they
contribute to high blood pressure.
   Johnson says doctors told her that women, particularly when
pregnant, craved the dirt because of a nutritional deficiency. But
she never believed that because she eats a balanced diet and
continued wanting dirt long after her babies were born.
   After studying blood samples of both dirt eaters and non-eaters,
Frate concluded that the nutritional status of the two groups
didn't differ statistically. The study refuted the long-held belief
that malnutrition contributed to the practice, an idea Frate said
was first advanced in a New Orleans medical journal in the 1850s by
a doctor studying the health of slaves.
   ``Cravings? Well, sure,'' Frate says. ``I'm an Italian-American
and I get cravings for pasta at least twice a month. I've got to
have my pasta. It's the same thing. There's not a physiological
urge that tells me I need this. I just like how it tastes.''
   But Frate says dirt-eating is probably going out of vogue, even
in the rural South.
   ``I think when this generation of women _ those 45 and older _
is gone, it's going to be unheard of.''
   But Johnson notes there is visible evidence that dirt eaters are
far from extinct. She points to a scooped-out hillside along
Mississippi Highway 17 about two miles southeast of Lexington. It's
one of two sites she knows of where local people continue to get
dirt to eat.
   Not just any dirt will do. It has to be the right kind of
crunchy clay. Frate says the most-popular eating dirt is a
light-brown clay known scientifically as ``red-yellow podzolic
soil.''
   Johnson says she knows of a few people who mail shoe boxes full
of local dirt to relatives who can't find suitable sites ``up
North.''
   Frate attributes the craving for dirt simply to early childhood
eating habits. Johnson agrees. She says her children don't eat dirt
because they grew up in urban Jackson.
   ``It's a universal practice,'' Frate says. ``If you look at the
ethnographic, the anthropological literature, every major cultural
group has at one time in their history been documented as consumers
of soils,'' Frate says. ``Plato was the first one to mention it in
writing _ Greek women consuming soil.''
   But Frate said he doesn't expect the practice to survive for too
many years, even in Africa.
   ``I'm sure as Third World nations become more technological,
they'll change like this area did _ literally leave the soil
behind,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ What happened in the American West a century ago
is happening today to the Indians of Brazil's Amazon Basin. It is
called ``ethnocide'' by some, a fight for survival by others.
Ironically, the fate of the Indians may be tied to the fate of the
environment as well.

   To symbolize his mourning, the young
Indian, wearing a suit, smeared a dark paste over his face and
walked up to the microphone facing hundreds of Brazilian
congressmen. He didn't say a word.
   That was last year when Brazil's lawmakers met to write a new
constitution, the country's eighth.
   Now, recalling the moment, Ailton Krenak, 33, explains, ``I
wanted to call attention to the lack of respect for the rights and
how government policy has killed us.''
   Krenak, coordinator of the Indian Nations of Brazil, which
represents 100 tribes, adds, ``It's a race against time because
soon there won't be any Indians left.''
   Anthropologists and Indian rights groups say the government is
committing ``ethnocide'' because violence, disease and land
invasion by mineral and agricultural interests are wiping out the
tribes and their cultures and with them the mighty Amazon forest.
   The Indians want their land preserved. They also want protection
from diseases that are foreign to them.
   The new constitution, inaugurated in October, does guarantee
Brazil's 250,000 native Indians the ``exclusive rights'' to their
land and its resources, which previously belonged to the federal
government.
   Brazil, with the Western world's eighth largest economy, still
grapples with its Indian question 100 years after the United States
and other nations resolved theirs, mostly by violence.
   When Brazil was discovered in 1500 by Portuguese explorers, 5
million Indians occupied the region. Today, only 5 percent of that
number survive. They make up 518 groups with 50 different languages
and 170 dialects. In addition, about 3,000 to 5,000 Indians, some
40 groups, still live isolated in the Amazon rain forest and have
had no contact with civilization.
   Contact often is fatal. Some Indians are killed in violent
encounters with outsiders, but most die because they have no
immunities against common diseases transmitted by whites, such as
malaria, tuberculosis, influenza or even the common cold.
   In the first half of this century alone, 87 Indian groups
disappeared, largely because of viruses. Experts estimate that 45
percent of a given Indian population dies within two years of the
first contact with outsiders.
   In Brazil, everyone agrees Indians can't remain isolated
forever. But ethical, ideological and practical questions arise as
to the best way to incorporate them into society.
   ``Continuing isolation is impossible, but brusque and violent
encounters with modern Brazil kill them,'' says Julio Gaiger, a
lawyer with the Indigenous Missionary Council, an activist group
linked to Brazil's dominant Roman Catholic church.
   Gaiger and Indian protection groups believe that if Indians are
given correct information they can decide for themselves how and to
what extent they want to join the larger society. They argue that
Indians can retain their culture if their lands are protected and
if they have self-determination.
   In all, Indian tribal lands take up 8 percent of Brazil, a
nation larger than the continental United States, and most Indians
live in the Amazon rain forest where minerals, lumber and gold
abound.
   But the government recognizes less than half the tribes' habitat
as Indian reserves. Studies conducted by the National Museum and
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro show 70 percent of land
specifically marked off as belonging to Indians has been invaded by
mineral companies.
   Despite Brazil's potential, its economic woes are enormous. It
has the largest foreign debt in the Third World, 600 percent yearly
inflation, 12 million landless rural families, an estimated 10
million street children and stark poverty, reflected by 70 million
of its 144 million people earning just $65 a month.
   In its haste to grow economically and realize its ancient dream
to populate the Amazon and protect its borders with nine South
American nations, Brazil's policy is to integrate Indians into
``civilization.''
   ``It is our moral duty to give Indians the same privileges that
the overall population has,'' says Deputy Foreign Minister Paulo
Tarso Flecha de Lima. ``It is our responsibility to bring them into
society. We can't leave them in their primitive state. ''
   Anthropologists charge that at the rate Brazil is clearing away
and burning off its Amazon forest for development, thousands of
Indians will die and those who survive will become third-rate
citizens.
   ``They get the worst jobs, lead miserable lives, and become
alcoholics or prostitutes,'' says anthropologist and Indian
activist Ezequias Paulo Heringer.
   Bruce Albert, a French anthropologist who has worked in Brazil
for more than a decade, says, ``Ideally, outside contact should be
avoided altogether, but when it can't be avoided, a strong health
scheme should be mounted and Indians should be vaccinated.''

   Critics say the government's record with Indians has worsened
under the administration of President Jose Sarney, who assumed
power in 1985 as the first civilian leader after 21 years of
military rule.
   ``There is not one nation in Latin America which treats its
Indians better than we do,'' counters Romero Juca Filho, a
33-year-old economist who presides over the National Indian
Foundation, the government's Indian agency, known by its Portuguese
initials as FUNAI.
   Founded in 1910 as the Indian Protection Service, it changed to
FUNAI in 1967 after allegations that federal agents deliberately
infected Indians with measles, smallpox and influenza. In
dismantling the original agency, the attorney general charged it
was ``a den of corruption and indiscriminate killings.''
   Early this year, Juca was convicted in one Amazon state and is
under investigation in three others for signing illegal contracts
with about 50 lumber companies last September and allowing them to
cut wood in Indian reserves. He faces only a fine, to be set later.
   Juca did not respond when asked about the investigation. He said
that under his administration, ``We have recuperated the image of
FUNAI.''
   ``It wasn't that the agency had a policy to kill. It was
carelessness and ignorance,'' he says.
   Juca claims that under him, 74 million acres were demarcated for
Indian reservations _ more than double the 30 million acres
reserved from 1910 to 1985.
   But critics say FUNAI is counting land that merely has been
identified as having Indians on it or was already in the process of
being demarcated when Juca took over.
   ``He's just lying. But even when FUNAI demarcates land, the
Indians don't know anything about it,'' says Osvaldo da Cunha, a
former FUNAI physician who coordinated the agency's health programs
for 10 years. ``Basically it's a way to reserve an area so it can
later be commercially developed by whoever pays the most. I quit
last year in utter frustration, anger and anguish.''
   Reports of violent clashes between isolated Indians and farmers
and miners are common. When word surfaced last year that itinerant
gold miners shot to death five Yanomami Indians, it created an
international furor.
   The Yanomamis are the largest primitive tribe in existence,
numbering about 10,000 in the remote northern territory of Roraima
which borders Venezuela.
   Backed by the military, FUNAI sent helicopters to remove the
gold miners and in the process yanked out a group of doctors,
anthropologists and missionaries who were working with the
Yanomamis.
   The Commission to Create the Yanomami Park, as the group is
called, has not been allowed back in the area. But some 60,000 gold
explorers remain and the government hasn't taken any action to
throw them out.
   The government charged that the commission, funded by
international organizations such as the Denmark-based International
Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, was a front for a foreign plot
to create another nation. Even Roraima's Bishop Aldo Mongiano was
ejected and accused of panning for gold to send to his native Italy.
   A reporter who asked repeatedly to visit the region was told by
FUNAI it was ``unsafe.''
   ``It's unbelievable. We had a good health program and the
Yanomamis were slowly becoming aware of the reality around them,''
said the group's coordinator, Carlos Zacquini. ``Now, the Indians
are living in a concentration camp and they're dying of malaria,
tuberculosis. But we can't do anything because only FUNAI and the
military are allowed in.''
   Last month, Juca said FUNAI demarcated 5 million acres for the
Yanomamis by naming the zone a ``national forest.'' In reality, the
Yanomamis' habitat was reduced by 75 percent, the tribe's four main
groups were divided into 19, and under the national forest category
their land can be commercially exploited.
   In September, Juca was named as the new governor of Roraima and
that has some anthropologists worried.
   ``Well, that will take care of the Yanomamis,'' said
anthropologist Alcida Ramos, a professor at the University of
Brasilia whom FUNAI denied permission to re-enter the region to
continue work started 10 years ago.
   For now, Indians look to the new constitution as their hope for
retaining their cultures.
   The charter includes some of the most generous Indian laws in
Brazil's history.
   ``It's very nice on paper, but the question is how _ or if _ the
law will be applied and by whom,'' Krenak says. ``We have a lot of
work ahead because up to now the government lacked interest.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are the clown cops of Cincinnati, Ohio, a
dynamic duo that tries to defuse domestic disturbances with a bit
of humor, an idea that came from a psychologist in upstate New
York. Like a poet once said, laughter is their shield. Most of the
time it works, they say. But not always.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE ZGANJAR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   When they got the call to investigate a domestic disturbance,
the two cops in Cincinnati, Ohio, went into their act.
   They pulled down their hats to make their ears protrude,
loosened their ties, buttoned their shirts askew, and rapped on the
door playfully with a ``shave and a haircut'' beat.
   ``Is that your car down there with the lights on?'' the officers
deadpanned as an angry man opened the door.
   The man, seeing the oddball cops, forgot he was angry and broke
into a smile.
   It's a trick the Cincinnati police department learned from a
psychologist in Troy, N.Y.
   ``Police arriving at the scene of a domestic dispute, for
instance, should try performing a Bugs Bunny impression or try
raiding the refrigerator before unholstering their nightsticks,''
says Robert A. Baron, chairman of the Psychology Department at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy. ``Well-timed clowning
often deters violence more effectively than the threat of force.''
   Cincinnati police officials concede that they were skeptical
when they first heard Baron explain his idea on a local talk show.
But since they began trying it in 1983, they're finding it works.
   ``Our bottom-line goal is to resolve conflict with the least
amount of force,'' says Michael Gardner, a Cincinatti police
officer who teaches the humor technique to new recruits. ``Just
having the police show up doesn't necessarily get attention.''
   Baron was teaching at Purdue University in Lafayette, Ind., in
the early 1970s when he first came up with the idea of using humor
to defuse potentially violent situations.
   ``The basic idea of the research centered on incompatible
responses,'' he says. ``If someone is angry, you do something that
will make them feel good. You'll reduce their anger and the things
that follow it, like aggression.
   ``The basic rule of thumb is that when people are experiencing
strong emotions, their logical thinking decreases. The research
tries to counter this. We try to pull people toward a calmer
state.''
   Gardner says Baron's ideas work best in domestic disputes.
   ``The more emotionally upset someone is the more effective it
is,'' he says. ``In a family fight, a person can be so locked into
what's going on they can have blinders on.''
   Baron explains that ``once you get people off the track, their
anger decreases.'' But he concedes that this technique may defuse a
volatile situation only temporarily.
   ``The idea is to get in quickly and stop the process,'' he says.
``It's done early in the process, when anger is just beginning.
It's not powerful late in the process. Then you might want to
withdraw.''
   Gardner was the first officer in Cincinnati to try clowning, but
he soon persuaded his partner to join him. He says they developed
several acts.
   ``We'd often knock with a `shave and a haircut' beat to it,''
says Gardner, a 15-year veteran of the force.
   Once inside, if the parties insisted on fighting, Gardner and
his partner would start rearranging the furniture in the room,
saying they needed space to loosen up for the fight.
   Gardner says he was once caught off guard by his partner who
gave a ``first-rate performance'' and stopped a violent family
fight.
   ``He threw his hat down during a domestic dispute and said he
didn't have to take this anymore,'' Gardner says. ``Eventually this
guy we had been telling to leave told my partner, `It's no big
deal. I'll go take a walk.'''
   Gardner says teaching the technique to new recruits at the
police academy is not always an easy job because, ``They have
preconceived ideas of what a police officer is and have a `rough
'em up' attitude,'' he says.
   On the other hand, he says, experienced officers think it's
``the best training they've ever had.''
   Gardner took a leave of absence a year ago to travel around the
country sharing what he knew with other police departments.
   He says he knows of no other police departments using the
technique, ``But many are becoming interested.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ As a reward for spending a year tutoring younger
pupils in the East Harlem Tutorial Program, a group of high school
students was given an opportunity to interview celebrities, sports
stars and successful business people. It's all part of a volunteer
program that has survived for 30 years with little governmental
assistance.

   The high school students asked the lawyer if she
had to punch a time clock. They wanted to know how the editor of
Sassy magazine felt about being in such a job at age 25.
   They asked Mel Blount, the Pittsburgh Steelers' cornerback when
they won four Super Bowls, when he knew he was going to become a
professional football player.
   The students are part of the East Harlem Tutorial Program,
celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. They were in an
enrichment program in which they conducted their own interviews
after hearing reporters from The New York Times, the Wall Street
Journal, and The Associated Press, talk about the basics of
interviewing.
   Twenty students took part in the program. They were all
encouraged to choose the person they most wanted to interview. Rock
stars, famous athletes, including Mike Tyson, all ranked high on
their lists, but there were some surprises. One student asked to
interview the curator of the Museum of Natural History.
   This was their reward for a year of tutoring younger students as
part of the Tutorial Internship Program (TIP) students. They also
got a $110-a-week stipend.
   The lawyer told the students that punching a time clock was not
part of lawyering.
   The editor of Sassy explained how she studied hard, worked hard
and it was okay to be that young.
   Blount, now director of player relations for the National
Football League, stressed the importance of getting a good
education and pointed out how few football players make it to the
NFL.
   But perhaps the star of the show was the anonymous assistant of
a top fashion photographer, Douglas Doubler.
   The students had come to interview Doubler, but the assistant
was assigned to show them around first. They asked him how he got
his job.
   He reported that he took a job sweeping the floors to get a
toehold into the glitzy world of high fashion photography. He
worked hard, was noticed and soon he was being asked to do other
things. Now he's Doubler's assistant.
   The East Harlem Tutorial Project (EHTP), is an unusual
mom-and-pop operation that began in an East Harlem living room and
gets little governmental aid. It provides one-on-one help to
students most at risk of dropping out. Volunteers range from these
neighborhood high school students to Wall Street yuppies, prep
school students, retirees and grandmothers.
   Susan Ingalls, a member of the EHTP staff, says these minority
tutors are often the first black role models the youngsters have
ever had.
   ``The youngster may have an older brother or sister the same age
as the tutor, but the older sibling doesn't sit down and help with
homework or show that he or she cares about them,'' Ingalls says.
   But the volunteers from the prep schools, who are mostly white,
are important to the program, too, she says.
   ``Often what happens, especially with the prep school students,
is that they get very involved with one child and remain in the
program for years working with that one student. That's probably
when it works best,'' says Julia C. Schieffelin, a former president
of the organization's board of directors.
   Julie Bailey, who became a volunteer after her daughter became a
tutor while in prep school, says the students usually went in
groups of three or four to the interviews.
   ``In a couple of cases they were struck dumb, but they recovered
enough to go on with the interviews,'' she says. ``For some, it was
their first experience in looking at the work world, in hearing
what it was like to deal with supervisors and authority.
   ``These were million-dollar interviews for these kids and we ran
the whole program on $750.''
   Glenn Hopkins, director of Project Discovery at Columbia
University, says the East Harlem project is unusual in that ``it's
not very bureaucratic. It's warm, inviting, accessible and you can
get involved in a very personal way.''
   ``You can get in there with a minimum of formality and touch a
kid, help a kid.''
   EHTP has a $375,000 budget this year, of which only $15,000
comes from the government. So it has not been affected by federal
cutbacks.
   It puts on a fund-raiser each year featuring Manhattan's
literati. Calvin and Alice Trilling _ he's a writer for The New
Yorker _ recruit many of the celebrities, such as Maya Angelou,
George Plimpton and Eli Wallach.

   Richard Mulligan, whose characters are often
on the threshold of madness, is the straight man in his new NBC
comedy series ``Empty Nest.''
   He plays a pediatrician whose wife has recently died and left
him with three grown daughters, at least two of whom are neurotic,
a nurse whose heart is still in Appalachia and a next-door-neighbor
who is a freeloader and free with advice.
   Mulligan is the perfectly normal one. Okay, so he talks to his
dog, but who doesn't?
   This is the Richard Mulligan who brought inspired lunacy to Burt
Campbell on ``Soap,'' went to pieces in the movie ``S.O.B.,'' made
Col. George A. Custer a case study in abnormal psychology in
``Little Big Man,'' and in ``Teachers'' was the looney who walked
into the school and started teaching.
   ``He's certainly different from my role on `Soap,''' Mulligan
says, noting that producer-writer Susan Harris created both series.
``This guy's a good doctor who cares deeply about his patients.
He's a good fellow trying to take care of his daughters. His wife
died 18 months ago and he still can't take the ring off.''
   Even as a straight man, reacting to the craziness going on
around him, Mulligan can't help being funny. His long, expressive
face, slapped together out of Silly Putty, has a direct line to the
funny bone. His talks to Dreyfuss, a lovable, monstrous mixture of
golden retriever and Saint Bernard, come off as dialogues. The
clown-faced Dreyfuss, like a canine version of Mulligan, reacts
with almost human emotions.
   The show, a spinoff from ``Golden Girls,'' also stars Dinah
Manoff and Kristy McNichol as his daughters, Park Overall as his
nurse, David Leisure as his neighbor and a dog named Bear as
Dreyfuss. The third daughter is away at college, but calls
frequently for help.
   ``Bear is very sweet and very smart,'' says Mulligan. ``There's
a lot of kidding on the set because he gets a little reward after
every scene. Now all the actors are demanding rewards. Bear even
has a double, his brother, Julio.''
   The idea for ``Empty Nest'' first appeared a few years ago as an
episode of ``Golden Girls.'' Paul Dooley and Rita Moreno starred as
husband and wife.
   ``It was originally about a father and mother whose children
have left the nest,'' says Mulligan. ``They look at each other and
say, `What now?' Then Susan came up with the idea of the widower.
That gave it more dimensions somehow. It became bittersweet, yet
funny.''
   Although the new show is a spinoff from ``Golden Girls,'' there
are no immediate plans for any crossover. Mulligan's character
lives in the same Miami neighborhood, so it's expected that at some
time in the future one of the ladies will pay a visit. Perhaps
Blanche will make a play for the doctor. Or the pediatrician may
treat Sophia and give her a lollipop.
   Mulligan grew up in the Bronx with ambitions of becoming a
playwright. His brother, Robert, is a director (``To Kill a
Mockingbird''). He studied playwriting at Columbia University, but
was soon turned toward acting.
   ``Empty Nest'' is his fifth series. In his first, ``The Hero,''
in 1966-67, he was a movie Western star who was afraid of horses
and was anything but a hero off-screen. Next came a small role as a
mystery writer in ``Diana,'' which starred Diana Rigg in 1973-74.
``Soap'' ran four years and made him a star, but his next series,
``Reggie,'' in 1983 was a quick flop.
   Mulligan these days is usually seen as a comic performer,
although he did do a straight dramatic role in the NBC miniseries
``Gore Vidal's Lincoln.''
   ``There was a time in the theater in New York nobody would give
me a comedy role,'' he says. ``I'd play in O`Neill or Tennessee
Williams. Once I was in Charlie's, an old theater bar, and I
couldn't convince anyone I could do comedy.
   ``Then I heard Gene Sax was going to do `Nobody Loves an
Albatross' and I auditioned for the role as the ghostwriter. I got
it. And I was good. So good, in fact, I had trouble getting
dramatic parts.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kate Nelligan has made a career on Broadway of
playing strong, independent women.
   In ``Plenty,'' she was the disillusioned wife of a British
diplomat witnessing England's decline after World War II. In Eugene
O'Neill's ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' she was a hearty and
plain-spoken Irish farm girl, bewitching the playwright's
whiskey-soaked alter ego. In ``Serious Money,'' she was a voracious
American arbitrageur, wheeling and dealing on the world's financial
markets.
   Now she has returned to New York in what could be her best stage
role yet _ the vibrant, volatile, red-haired heroine of Michael
Weller's 1950s family drama, ``Spoils of War.''
   She portrays Elise, a left-wing, much-married, extravagant woman
whose one true passion is her teen-age son Martin. The play,
described by Weller as ``semi-autobiographical,'' centers on
Martin's attempt to bring his mother and his long-absent father
back together. Nelligan's co-stars include Jeffrey DeMunn as the
husband and Christopher Collet as her adored son.
   For the actress, ``Spoils of War'' represents nearly a year-long
journey to Broadway. Nelligan has lived with the character and the
play since last January when the director, Austin Pendleton,
suggested her for the role of Elise.
   ``The play was presented to me then as an unfinished piece of
work,'' says the Canadian-born actress. ``The first act was pretty
much in shape and the second act wasn't. There was a beginning and
an end. But I didn't say `What are you going to do with it?' I
said, `I want to do it.'''
   About two weeks before rehearsals started, Nelligan sat down for
a three-hour meeting with Weller to talk, not about the play, but
about the woman in it. They discussed who she was, as well as
things the playwright knew about Elise from his own life.
   It was the first time in her 16 years as a professional actress
that Nelligan was there during the creation.
   ``I've worked on new plays with writers, but I've never worked
on a play that came such a long way,'' the actress says. ``Michael
was finding the play as we went along.
   ``The character of Elise started out as an Auntie Mame. She was
just a real good-time girl. In the first performance, she appeared
as a ghost to a character who is no longer even in the play, the
adult Martin who is on the point of divorcing his wife.''
   Weller rewrote the play several times before the drama opened in
May at the tiny off-Broadway Second Stage. The theater company was
devoting its entire season to the playwright and ``Spoils of War''
was the finale in a year that also saw productions of Weller's
``Moonchildren'' and ``Loose Ends.''
   The rewriting continued during the play's Second Stage
engagement, often with the actors rehearsing one version during the
day and performing a different one at night.
   ``It was an awful period,'' Nelligan admits, particularly until
the actors discovered the people they were playing. All they could
do was trust the playwright, she recalls.
   ``I thought Michael was moving toward something but it was just
very painful to be performing something when I didn't know what I
was doing a lot of time,'' Nelligan says. ``I've always been sure
of my lines, and now I wasn't sure what would come out of my mouth
because the lines were always being changed.''
   There were other changes after the off-Broadway run ended, and
the company prepared for its November opening at New York's Music
Box Theater.
   There was a break from the end of June until the middle of
August while Weller worked on a new ending.
   ``There are a couple of new actors, a new set and more
rewrites,'' Nelligan says.
   One thing Nelligan didn't discuss with Weller was what he was
going to do with the play.
   ``I'd never ask him that,'' the actress says. ``I think that's
the way he likes to work. It's his play. It isn't mine.''
   Nelligan insists the role was not tailor-made for her.
   ``Michael was writing from memory,'' she says. ``But it's been
useful to see all the places he has gone to with the play because
that informs what you end up with. Even all the rejected
possibilities that he explored. They might be taken out but they
are in your memory to use for what's left.''
   It was Nelligan's idea to let her character sport long red hair
and she willingly donned a wig to make Elise more flamboyant and
fun.
   ``The character has got quite a range _ bigger than anybody I
ever played,'' Nelligan says. ``She can have a lot of fun and gives
people a lot of fun. And then she's also in a lot of pain and a lot
of trouble. She's a human, flesh-and-blood creature.''
   Although born in Canada, Nelligan didn't make her professional
Canadian debut until ``Spoils of War'' opened in Toronto in
September before coming to New York.
   Most of her career has been centered in England and the United
States. Despite her schooling at London's Central School of Speech
and Drama, her best training, she says, has been has been watching
other performers, particularly at the National Theater and the
Royal Shakespeare Company.
   ``The greatest teacher I ever had was an actor named Colin
Blakeley who died last year,'' Nelligan says. ``I did George
Bernard Shaw's `Heartbreak House' with him when I was 24 years old
and I learned a lot.''
   Nothing she had done prepared her for the intense, exhilarating
work of ``Spoils of War,'' particularly in its early days.
   ``The process had been so overheated what with all the rewrites,
the short, short rehearsal time and that tiny theater at Second
Stage and no money,'' Nelligan says. ``Getting it on stage and
having it survive all those things was hard.
   ``I was so tired,'' she remembers. ``Then after a few weeks, it
got to be something I could do and go away from.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Bird'' and ``Mystic Pizza''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Bird''
   
   How well can one ever know a genius? Can we ever really open the
many doors to their lives and capture their scattered energies?
   Clint Eastwood attempts to harness the creative genius and
tortured man who was Charlie Parker in his movie, ``Bird,'' a
bittersweet portrait of the great jazzman who died at the age of 34
in 1955.
   His journey begins on the dusty dirt roads outside Kansas City,
when Parker was a horn-blowing child, and moves with the tempo of
be-bop to the hot clubs of New York, where a young trumpet player
named Dizzy Gillespie was all the rage.
   With Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell on piano, Kenny Clarke on
drums and later a young Miles Davis on trumpet, Parker and
Gillespie helped define and create a new musical venture in jazz _
bebop.
   ``Bird'' _ Parker's nickname was Yardbird and shortened to the
Bird _ harvests all the creative juices of that age, the
spontaneity, the excitement. At the same time, it pokes into the
underbelly of the jazz world _ drugs, alcohol, debauchery.
   And Parker was no stranger to that lost world.
   Forest Whitaker (``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Platoon'') is
gentle yet fierce, playful yet obsessed in his role as Parker, for
which he was awarded the best actor prize at the Cannes Film
Festival. It was well deserved for a stunning performance that even
captures the hunched body stances assumed by the musician as he
performed.
   As Chan Parker, Diane Venora (``Ironweed,'' ``F-X'') finds the
right balance between free spirit and strong, loving wife who
battles her husband's philandering and personal demons and at the
same time champions his work and well-being.
   Their relationship and music are the only constants in Parker's
existence. We see him slip deeper into despair as drugs and alcohol
destroy him. Eventually, the death of his daughter pushes him into
the abyss. His grief and perhaps a glimmer of the Parker enigma are
shown when he tries to contact Chan after learning on the road
about the tragedy.
   He sends an endless stream of telegrams to Chan _ the first
signed ``your husband, Charlie Parker.'' This formality, in a way,
mirrors his inability to completely surrender himself in an
intimate relationship.
   Still, we never really know Charlie Parker.
   Eastwood is spare in his direction, allowing his actors to reach
deeper into themselves. He has filmed the Malpaso Production for
Warner Bros. in muted tones and shadows. Clearly, he intended the
somber moods of black and white and probably should have shot
``Bird'' in that pristine way because the movie suffers from being
too dark, sometimes obscuring what's on the screen.
   Lenny Niehaus did the score, which isolates Parker's original
playing of ``Laura,'' ``April in Paris,'' ``Ornithology,''
``Parker's Mood'' and other jazz tunes and remixes his recorded
solos with contemporary musicians including bassist Ron Carter,
trumpeter John Faddis, pianists Walter Davis Jr. and Barry Harris.
   Jazz purists won't like the scoring; others will find the
soundtrack outstanding.
   Rated R for language, drug use.

   ``Mystic Pizza''
   
   What kind of a movie is ``Mystic Pizza''? A far-out rock
musical? A horror story about a man-killing pizza? It is neither.
Rather, it concerns the romantic misadventures of three waitresses
in a pizza parlor in the town of Mystic, Conn.
   Don't be put off by the ambiguous-sounding title and the lack of
star names. ``Mystic Pizza'' is a marvelously warm and funny
comedy-drama that is frankly sentimental but never cloying. It is
far more satisfying than the big-budget offerings with box-office
names.
   The film begins with a nervous bride, Jojo (Lili Taylor),
walking down the church aisle amid the approving glances of family
and friends. Midway through the ceremony, she passes out cold. End
of wedding.
   Jojo's problem is that she adores the body of fisherman Bill
(Vincent O'Donofrio) but she resists commitment. Her friend, Kat
(Annabeth Gish), might be willing to commit but boys are put off by
her intellect _ she's going to study astronomy on a Yale University
scholarship. Boys are no problem for her beautiful sister Daisy
(Julia Roberts). She has Ado Annie's problem: the inability to say
no.
   Daisy becomes enmeshed with a spoiled rich kid (Adam Storke),
and her sister falls for a married architect (William R. Moses)
with Robert Redford looks and a daughter who needs babysitting.
Most of the film concerns the unraveling of the three romances, but
there are colorful scenes in the pizza joint presided over by the
mountainous Conchata Ferrell.
   What makes ``Mystic Pizza'' so enjoyable is the wittily
vernacular script by Amy Jones, Randy and Perry Howze and Alfred
Uhry. It is one of the few occasions when multiple authors appear
to have enhanced a screenplay.
   The direction by Donald Petrie is right on the mark _ crisp,
funny, intensely human.
   The performances are a delightful surprise. Roberts is a
gorgeous brunette with fire in her eyes. Taylor has a sharp comedic
style, and Gish evokes the most sympathy of the trio. Moses
(``Falcon Crest'') is silkily seductive as the architect, and
Storke and D'Onofrio are excellent.
   The seaside town of Mystic also plays a major role, and it is
beautifully photographed by Tim Suhrstedt.
   ``Mystic Pizza'' is rated R for language and sex scenes. A
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. release. Running time 104 minutes.

City,'' ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the Spring.''
   
   ``Beetlejuice'' (Warner Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated PG)
   
   If a newly-deceased yuppie couple finds their Laura Ashley-esque
New England home occupied by a new family with decorating taste so
bad it could awaken the dead, who ya gonna call?
   ``Beetlejuice!''
   And not a bad call at that, with a hilarious Michael Keaton
starring in the title role of this wacky film which pokes fun at
life and death in the 1980s, and leaves you puzzled whether there's
any important difference between those two states.
   ``Beetlejuice'' opens with Adam and Barbara Maitland perishing
when they drive their standard-issue yuppie Volvo stationwagon off
a wooden bridge. Upon dying, the first thing they learn is that the
crucial difference between life and death is that ghosts seem to
assume pastel tones and dress more flamboyantly.
   They then learn that they are to spend the next 125 years
haunting the home they so lovingly decorated. That sounds OK at
first. But that fate turns hellish when an upscale Manhattan couple
named Deetz and their death-obsessed daughter move in and threaten
the decor with the most tacky taste imaginable states may have higher age
restrictions.

   ``Take What You Need'' (Atlantic) _ Robin Trower
   
   Robin Trower's latest, ``Take What You Need,'' is for anyone who
carries a torch for 1970's-style hard rock and needs a dose of that
mix of heavy guitar, husky vocals and gut-kicking drums.
   Record company hype says the new album showcases Trower's
maturity as a _ gasp! _ songwriter. Don't believe it for a minute;
Trower's guitar playing is the main attraction here.
   And on that level, it works. ``Take What You Need'' comes alive
when Trower steps to the forefront and starts picking. Otherwise,
the album seldom rises above the ordinary.
   Trower's new four-man band opens with ``Tear It Up,'' a bouncy
tune with run-of-the-mill, looking out for No. 1 lyrics: ``I'm
gonna tear it up tonight _ This is my time _ I'm gonna tear it up
tonight _ Take what's mine.''
   Next up is a ballad, ``Take What You Need (From Me),'' which
features dreamy, liquid guitar work from Trower. This is Trower
doing what he does best.
   The last two songs on Side 1, however, show why they don't make
records like this anymore. The title of ``Love Attack'' tells you
all you need to know. It's unimaginative music with a dumb, macho
front. And ``I Want You Home'' has even less to offer.
   There's another nice ballad, ``Over You,'' on Side 2, as well as
the funky ``Careless,'' which has a guitar line reminiscent of Jimi
Hendrix' ``Machine Gun,'' and the genuinely catchy ``Love Won't
Wait Forever.''
   From the time he left Procol Harum to launch a solo career in
1973, Trower has been unfairly criticized as a Little League
Hendrix. It's a bum rap.
   He obviously was influenced by Hendrix, as well as other leading
rock 'n' roll guitarists of the era. But although he has never
attained the heights of a Hendrix, Trower continues to be a fine
guitarist whose licks stay with you.
   Whether his type of music still has an audience is debatable.
It's dinosaur rock, to be sure _ but pretty good dinosaur rock.

   ``Dream of Life'' (Arista) _ Patti Smith
   
   ``Dream of Life'' ends a nine-year artistic hiatus for
poet-singer Patti Smith, whose 1975 album ``Horses'' was one of the
best debuts in rock history and redefined the role of women in pop
music.
   The only thing redefined on ``Dream of Life'' is Smith: She is
now happily married and the mother of two young children. Domestic
tranquility appears to have robbed her formerly ferocious music of
the bite that made a lasting impression.
   Still, ``Dream of Life'' _ a positive and spiritual record _ is
occasionally moving. And Smith, in great voice throughout, is
generous with catchy melodies. She shows she has been listening to
the radio during the past nine years, cooing like Cyndi Lauper on
the pensive ``Going Under'' and borrowing from the Bangles on the
hook-filled ``Looking for You.''
   Smith, whose work in the 1970s represented some of the most
successful mergers of poetry to rock arrangements, occasionally
gets tangled up in her wordy lyrics. They suck all the energy from
``Where Duty Calls,'' a narrative on the Marine deaths in Lebanaon
that is an embarrassing mess.
   The best moments come at the end of Side 1, with the thumping
``Up There Down There,'' and the beautiful ballad ``Paths That
Cross'' _ both treatises on the afterlife.
   ``Those who seek feel the glow, a glow we all will know,'' Smith
sings on the latter. It's easy to forget that on ``Horses,'' Smith
opened with the words, ``Jesus died for somebody's sins but not
mine.''
   One lesson ``Dream of Life'' provides is that 13 years and two
kids will change a person's perspective.

   ``Re-Doo-Wopp'' (RCA) _ The Tokens
   
   The Tokens hold an honored place in pop music because of their
1960s hit, ``The Lion Sleeps Tonight.''
   ``Wim-oweh, wim-oweh,'' remember?
   You can forgive a lot for a song like that, but the Tokens have
gone beyond endurance in ``Re-Doo-Wopp.'' It is amazing that a disc
could include ``Little Star,'' ``Hush-a-Bye,'' ``Little Darlin',''
``Do You Wanna Dance'' and ``La Bamba'' _ just in the first six
minutes _ and yet be such a meadow muffin.
   The problem is this idea of ``re-do,'' or as the liner notes
explain, to mix doo-wop with ``today's recording technology to
satisfy generations of music lovers.''
   Like, we're awfully embarrassed by these old songs, but if we
put a really thudding, stupid electro-whizbang beat underneath then
you might, like, see the eternal timelessness of it all. It's the
same nitwit logic that sends old rock stars out in ill-fitting
toupes, prancing around like paunches had sex appeal.
   It's sad, because the Tokens are a tight group that does more
than justice to the harmonies which are doo-wop's heart and soul.
Doo-wop is music of street corners, subway tunnels and sock hops _
not great music, maybe, but deserving of a little respect on its
own terms.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Michael Caine Is No Longer The Workingest Actor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in Hollywood after a 20-month absence,
Michael Caine wanted to correct the belief that he is the busiest
actor in movies.
   ``Gene Hackman has four pictures coming out,'' he declared.
``And now we have another candidate.
   ``I was having dinner with Ben Kingsley the other night. He's
got five coming out. I've only got two, as well as the television
movie about Jack the Ripper. Then I have no other projects, I'm
truly out of work. In case any producers are listening, I'm
available.''
   Caine was back in Los Angeles to help launch ``Without a Clue,''
in which he plays a Sherlock Holmes impersonator to Kingsley's Dr.
Watson. It was a surprisingly sentimental visit for Caine, who
returned to his native England after being a Beverly Hills resident
for nine years.
   ``I was very happy here. I had everything a person could want,
including artistic and financial success,'' he recalled.
   ``But then one day I started to get homesick for the English
countryside. You know, homesickness can almost become a terminal
disease. I became very unhappy.
   ``So I moved back to England, and this is my first trip back to
Los Angeles. And now we're going to buy a little holiday place,
just to come and visit. When I went to England I thought, `Well,
I'll obviously miss the weather in L.A. and I'll miss the
efficiency and the service industries which are wonderful.'
   ``What I never figured on was the many friends I made here. And
the actual depth of friendship. When we came back this time, it was
amazing how pleased we were to see everybody and how pleased
everybody was to see us. My wife said, `We've just got to have a
place here, where we can come and hang out.' We used to go to the
South of France. Now we'll come here.''
   When ``Without a Clue'' was first suggested to Caine, he
dismissed the idea of portraying Sherlock Holmes.
   ``I could handle the upper-crust accent,'' he said. ``But I
figured: How could I play the role any better than Basil Rathbone?
He was the archetypal Sherlock Holmes.
   ``I always saw Holmes as having a noble, aquiline face. I have
the face of a well-lived-in peasant. I always enjoyed the stories
of Sherlock Holmes, but I knew no one would ever ask me to play
him.''
   To Caine's delight, he found the script cast him as a dissolute,
womanizing actor who is enlisted to portray Holmes by Watson.
``This Holmes is more like Inspector Clouseau,'' the actor
explained, referring to the character immortalized by the late
Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movie.
   Last summer Caine filmed another comedy, ``Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels,'' with Steve Martin.
   ``I've been trying to do comedy for a long time,'' said Caine.
``I did a small role for Alan Alda in `Sweet Liberty,' figuring
that would break me in. When Woody Allen asked me to do `Hannah and
Her Sisters,' I figured I had it made.
   ``But during my scenes Woody was always saying, `Not so funny,
Michael.' He wanted me to be serious. Well, I guess he knew what he
was doing, because it won me the Academy Award.'' He laughed
appreciatively.
   Despite awards and million dollar salaries, Michael Caine, 55,
has never forgotten his cockney beginnings as son of a fish-market
porter and a scrubwoman. His formal education ended at the age of
15, and he drifted into acting after serving tea in a London
theater. Unlike most English actors, he did not attend any drama
academies.
   ``I am formally untrained as an actor,'' he remarked, ``and
never in prestigious theaters like the Royal Shakespeare company or
the National Theater. I'm more of a journeyman kind of actor, doing
what I can where I can.
   ``But the results are the same: You wind up in movies with
playing the truth. If you're not truthful, you're not entertaining
in a serious thing. And if you're not truthful, you won't get any
laughs in comedy.''
   Caine spent 11 years in London theater and television, finally
reaching the West End, the equivalent of Broadway. Two weeks later
he was offered the role of an effete British officer in the film
``Zulu.'' Soon afterward, ``Alfie'' brought him an Academy Award
nomination and a non-stop career. He has never returned to the
theater.
   ``I was basically a movie actor in my mind,'' he said. ``I think
that was because I came from the working class.
   ``Whenever I read biographies of English actors like John
Gielgud or Ralph Richardson or Larry Olivier, they start out: `I
fell in love with the theater when my nanny took me to my first
play; I knew what I wanted to be.' I never went to the theater
until I was 21, 22.
   ``I went to the cinema, and I grew up in the cinema. That's why
I have such an affinity with America. Being working class, I
identified with the American cinema because they had working class
heroes. In those days our cinema was usually taken from
drawing-room comedies played by drawing-room actors with whom I had
nothing in common in my life. I always saw things in common with
America.''

<TEXT>
   Not every event in a book fits together
perfectly. And the world's sharply different political and social
systems hardly do, either.
   So why should buildings be different?
   A developing school of architecture is demonstrating that
architecture can be as varied _ and even chaotic _ as life itself.
Buildings can veer off at sharp angles, soar up or down, take
surprising turns and appear to hang in space. Or they can look like
something that just collapsed.
   Photographs and plans of buildings that show the latest trends
in a movement called ``deconstructivist architecture'' recently
appeared in a small exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New
York. The creations were by seven architects who work separately
and in different countries. But in their very originality, the
designers have something in common.
   ``The idea of a balanced, harmonious world is a little bit of a
myth. Contemporary society ... is far more complex than that,''
said one participant, Swiss-born Bernard Tschumi, dean of the
School of Architecture at Columbia University in New York.
   ``Some of the work in the show is trying to capture part of that
aspect.''
   A stroll around the exhibit showed a variety of buildings whose
creators seem to have totally sworn off of symmetry and tradition.
   There was a proposed housing complex for West Berlin by Daniel
Libeskind of Milan, Italy. It looked, well, as the catalog said:
``A colossal bar angled up from the ground, so that one end floats
10 stories high, looking over the Berlin Wall.''An array of oblique
supports holds up the floating arm.
   Iraqi-born Zaha M. Hadid, who now works in London, showed a
design for a proposed nightclub for Hong Kong. The building is
formed by a series of platforms that appear to be flying off in
different directions from a hillside.
   A proposed skyscraper by the Austrian architectural group, Coop
Himmelblau, consisted of a series of independent vertical volumes,
some of which included bold curves and sharp angles, connected by a
series of oblique passageways and substructures.
   There also was a design of the Center for the Visual Arts at
Ohio State University, designed by New York architect Peter
Eisenman. The center has already been constructed. The design
showed a 516-foot-long cage of steel columns and beams rising on an
incline to a height of five stories, breaking its way through two
existing buildings.
   The Califorina Aerospace Museum in Los Angeles, which also has
already been constructed, was designed by American Frank Gehry. The
twisted facade walls look as if the building is going through the
strain of a liftoff.
   At first glance, deconstructivism may seem to be merely a
question of throwing the rule book away and improvising: the more
angular and radical the design, the better. But the movement, in
fact, has a logic of its own, and carries some heavy philosophical
and historical baggage.
   Ever since the late 1970s some architects have been trying ``to
push the limits of architecture and discover how far they could
go,'' Tschumi said.
   So far, he said, Britain has been most sensitive to the
movement. Much deconstructivist work stems from the Architecture
Association in London, with which most of the people in the show
were associated in the late '70s and early '80s.
   Some people look farther back for deconstructivism's roots.
   Architect-critic Joseph Giovannini cites the influence not only
of the art movement called Russian Constructivism that existed
roughly from 1910-30, but also of a French literary and
philosophical movement known as deconstructionism.
   French deconstructionist Jacques Derrida, he said, believed that
just as a literary text can never achieve a truly ``unifying
wholeness,'' a building, too, can consist of disparate, unaligned
parts.
   Many of the deconstructivist projects, Giovannini added in an
interview, ``with their images of dislocation, the physical forms,
raise metaphysical questions.''
   He wrote in a recent article for The New York Times Magazine
that the deconstructivist movement ``mirrors an unruly world,
subject to caroming moral, political and economic systems.''
   Buildings, however, still need to stand up, even if they are the
product of flights of metaphysical imagination. Tschumi noted that
a large part of the work at the exhibition ``deals with new finds
in structures and is the product of very advanced computer
engineering.'' He said they are part of a ``serious body of work.''
   Buildings also need to be useable by their occupants, however
pleasurable they may be to their architects.

<TEXT>
   Medicine Sunday believes in simplicity: with a
beat.
   No horns. No synthesizers. No voice lessons for their lead
singer.
   Medicine Sunday wants nothing to get in the way of their music _
or their audience. Ask anyone who has seen them play.
   ``Some people will sit there and listen and really understand,
and there are people who get into the energy of the band and they
start dancing and jumping around,'' bassist Matt Barton said. ``If
the crowd's jumping around, we start jumping around. I'll jump off
the stage.
   ``It feeds off each other.''
   ``I don't feel seperated from the audience on stage,'' added
vocalist Frank Pupo. ``Anything that happens, happens.''
   Along with Barton and Pupo, are guitarist Oliver Wolf and
drummer Steve Reisman. Pupo and Wolf formed the band two years ago.
   ``We kind of clicked and started rehearsing,'' Pupo said.
``Things started going good and we decided to get a bass player.''
   The bass player, Barton, came from a diverse musical background.
   ``I played in pop rock bands and jazz bands,'' Barton said. ``I
used to play gospel music in high school.''
   Medicine Sunday's sound has been compared to U2 and Joy
Division. Pupo, whose singing recalls Jim Morrison and the late Ian
Curtis of Joy Division, says the band tries to keep its sound as
simple as possible.
   ``When you have over-production, you lose a lot. You're
committed to sounding just like the record, otherwise people are
disappointed,'' Pupo said. ``All the bands I've ever liked have the
same basic formula.
   Pupo began performing live when he was 18.
   ``People put their fingers in their ears. I was kicked out of a
couple of bands.'' But Pupo kept singing and eventually caught on.
   ``I found someone who liked the way I sang,'' said Pupo, adding
that he learned how important breathing correctly was for a
vocalist. ``I sing from my throat a lot. I like the sound I get.''
   Pupo has been writing poems from an early age and is the group's
main lyricist.
   ``I started out in California. They had different ideas about
how things should be done. The lyrics they wanted are a lot more
literal: `I'm in love with a girl.' I don't write like that.
   Pupo says he tries to let the audience derive its own meanings
from his songs.
   ``I try not to force meanings on people. When you read a book,
you get an interpretation of a character. It's stream of
consciousness.''
   Simplicity, again, is an important part of Pupo's writing. ``I
try to get as much meaning to as many words as I can, like Japanese
haikus.''
   Medicine Sunday has signed with URG records and the first album
is expected to be released this fall. The band's most popular song
in concert has been ``Conviction,'' inspired by one of Pupo's poems.
   It's got that light tone. We try to communicate with the music
and the words,'' Pupo said. ``You're riding along and you go up a
little bit and you go down a little bit.''
   ``Conviction'' was structured around Barton's bass line.
   ``I put the bass line together when I was falling asleep in
bed,'' he said. ``I tried to calm myself down and started playing
these chords. It's a very hypnotic song, kind of like a battle
hymn.''
   Medicine Sunday produced its own album with the emphasis, not
surprisingly, on simplicity.
   ``What kills underground bands is they get in, they make a great
album, and they get over-produced,'' Pupo said. ``If everything is
over-produced, you can't feel the emotion of the music.''
   The band's songs, such as ``Dirty Little World'' and ``Big
Machine,'' are hard-edged. ``No Good Days'' lives up to the
bleakness of its title.
   ``You just have a lousy week and you wake up and it's going to
happen all over again. You see no light at the end of the tunnel,''
Pupo said.
   Medicine Sunday may share the harsh view of the world as
envisioned by punks, but they have no use for the ``hope I die
before I get old'' mentality of so many groups.
   ``We're not concerned about being young forever,'' Pupo said.
``I don't even think we'll put pictures on the album.''
   The band's goals, like their sound, are simple. Medicine Sunday
is not looking to make a million dollars, it just wants to remain a
part of the fans' lives.
   ``When I read a book and it really affects me, the guy has done
his job,'' Pupo said. ``Kafka did what he set out to do. I don't
necessarily have to meet him to be affected by him.''

<HEAD>Woman Working in Basement Lab Developing Acid-Eating Microbe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAIGE St. JOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former high school science teacher is
growing microbes that could revolutionize mining by neutralizing
the acid drainage that costs companies and the government millions
for cleanup.
   Jo Davison has convinced Peabody Coal Co., the nation's largest
producer, to let her ``bugs'' eat the poisonous runoff from a West
Virginia mine.
   ``We'll give it a try,'' said Jim Crawford, manager of
environmental affairs at Peabody's West Virginia headquarters here.
``If it works, great! If it doesn't, well ...''
   Acid drainage oozes its telltale red water anywhere mine
operators cut into earth and stone containing pyrites. The global
problem plagues miners of not only coal, but also of gold, silver
and other natural resources. It starts with the breaking of the
soil and lasts long after the mine has been shut down.
   ``Anywhere there are pyrites, there is acidic drainage,'' said
West Virginia University researcher Jeff Skousen. Pyrites are metal
sulfides that in the presence of air and water produce sulfuric
acid.
   Anywhere there is acid drainage, miners face expensive chemical
treatments to remove heavy metals and neutralize the water, and the
chemicals used to treat the drainage themselves often are toxic.
   Coal industry officials have pegged the water treatment costs at
$1 million a day in the United States. West Virginia has paid more
than $1 million in three years to treat abandoned sites in just two
counties.
   Metals from mine drainage poison 20 percent of West Virginia's
streams, and 13 percent are too acid from the drainage or too
alkaline from overzealous treatment, according to a state report
last month.
   Enter Davison, a gravel-voiced woman with a stubborn certainty
there must be a natural solution to the man-made problem.
   Her work parallels wetlands research at West Virginia
University, where she was completing a master's degree in science
education in the 1950s.
   After a dam holding mine runoff broke and flooded a pristine bog
in German Valley, West Virginia University researcher Joe Lange
discovered that water leaving the bog was crystal clear.
   Mine reclamation researchers then urged building wetlands with
acid-tolerant cattails and sphagnum mosses to somehow trap and
negate the heavy metals that leach from mines. Scientists don't
understand fully how wetlands work, but they do work, and the
industry slowly is adopting the process.
   More than 100 artificial wetlands were created at mine sites in
southwestern Pennsylvania last year, Skousen said. ``More and more
people are finding wetlands can reduce contaminants. We're not sure
how long these will continue. What happens when they dry up? That's
one of the big questions.''
   The plants themselves absorb only a minute amount of the heavy
metals. Indications are that most of the action is at the
microscopic level. Once the heavy metals are removed, acidity is
easily lowered with a wash of limestone.
   Davison, who four years ago quit her teaching job to open Lambda
Environmental Technologies Inc. in Columbus, Ohio, has been on the
microbe trail since the bog discovery. For years, she and high
school teacher Barbara Harris gathered and experimented with every
kind of wetland microbe they could get their hands on, digging in
muck from Florida to Canada.
   In the end, Davison bred microbes that attack specific metals.
One oxidizes iron, others do the same to aluminum, sulfur or
manganese. They chelate, or bond with, the metals so they can
oxidize and drop out of the water.
   Then comes the real kicker. The redeposited iron resembles the
pyrites laid down millions of years ago when the coal seams were
created. ``We're creating a situation for forming coal,'' Skousen
said.
   Microbes have other potentials, in removing sulfur from coal
that otherwise would be discarded, in treatment of polluted water,
in mining uranium and gold, and in pesticide usage.
   Davison's process is called an Immobilized Microbial Pollution
Purification System and she says only she has it.
   The microbiologist and her nine employees isolate and hybridize
the bugs in a basement laboratory in Columbus, grow them in vats in
Dayton, Ohio, and, from an office in Morgantown, plot their release
into special mine drainage ponds.
   Patents are pending on the microbes, their mixes, and the
growing mediums that allow the organisms to live in acid water in
the first place.
   ``I developed the bugs. I found which microbes do what. I know
which bugs work, and what their proper balance is,'' she said.
``But they say, `If it's that simple, then why in the hell didn't
Penn State discover it?'''
   Texas A&M University has selected Davison to join a $189 million
project to build a demonstration treatment pond at a lignite strip
mine site there.
   But the industry itself has been slow to take the bait.
   State Energy Department spokesman Roger Hall said Davison's
results have been amazing in the laboratory, but less impressive in
the field.
   ``They haven't reached the point where they've totally
eliminated the problem,'' Hall said. ``They need to do some work on
it.''
   He cited the use of the microbe system on an acidic mine
drainage problem in Garrett County, Md. Davison's microbes have
remarkably reduced iron levels in the water, but not consistently
brought them within regulatory levels.
   Davison says that with more time the levels will be in
compliance. ``Everyone has laughed at the wetlands and laughed at
our microbes. They say you can never get that many bugs together to
treat so much runoff. But it works. We can engineer any site in
order to handle the drainage.''
   At Peabody Coal's Robinhood mine in Boone County, for instance,
Davison's company will treat 50 to 100 gallons a minute of acid
runoff with a solid bed of microbe-seeded dirt beneath a pond of
microbe-seeded water.
   Federal Office of Surface Mining agronomist Eric Perry in
Pittsburgh said coal operators might be more willing to give the
process a try if they knew how it worked. He said the industry ``is
very conservative, especially about something that appears to be a
black box with bugs inside it.''
   Davison is keeping her bugs in the box by design. Exactly what
they are and what they do will not be published until she has a
patent.
   Lambda has successfully treated acid drainage at a handful of
sites in Ohio, West Virginia and Maryland, but Peabody's applied
technology program is its first major industrial contract.
   For Peabody, she has cooked up a balanced ecosystem of 77
bacteria, 56 algae groups, seven fungi and 15 protozoa. A generic
mix would be cheaper, but at this point, Davison cannot afford less
than brilliant results.
   Peabody Coal spends about $50,000 a year treating the mine now,
Crawford said. Neither he nor Davison would say how much the
microbe treatment will cost, but if it works, he said, the savings
will be substantial.
   ``There's no doubt about it. It would sure reduce our overall
costs.''

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group isn't just the sum of its parts,
says a researcher who was driven by his own experiences to study
why bright people sometimes founder when they put their heads
together.
   Robert J. Sternberg, a professor of pyschology and education,
found that the success or failure of a group effort is determined
in large part by the blend of the members' attributes and skills.
   When business, government or other organizations form committees
or problem-solving groups, ``too much attention is given to who the
individuals are and instead of how they work together,'' Sternberg
said.
   The key question that should be asked, he said, is, ``Will these
people be smart as a group?''
   ``There are bright people who are not good in groups because
they lack social skills. You could be bright but obnoxious and then
people are going to try to show you a thing or two and not
listen,'' he said. ``One bore in a group can destroy the group. One
jerk can really through a meeting off.''
   In a study of 96 volunteers aged 14 to 70, working alone and in
threes, Sternberg and a graduate student found the effectiveness of
any group can be predicted by knowing the IQ of its smartest member.
   Maximum IQ made more of a difference than average IQ, according
to the study, which will be published in the December issue of the
journal Intelligence.
   ``In every group you want to have one very smart person,'' said
Sternberg.
   But there can be too much of a good thing: If one group member
is too much smarter than his or her fellow problem-solvers, the IQ
predictor is no longer valid.
   ``If the other persons are too mediocre, they may not recognize
or accept'' what the brightest member has to say, Sternberg said. A
vastly smarter person may also hinder group success by appearing
threatening to other members.
   An even better predictor of group success or failure is maximum
creativity, said Sternberg.
   The Yale researchers measured creativity by having two raters
evaluate the performance of study participants, as recorded on
videotapes of group sessions.
   The groups were asked to develop a marketing plan for an
imaginary new sugar substitute or to solve an economic problem that
threatened a community's rural lifestyle.
   The researchers also looked at how social skills affect a
group's success. They found an effective group will have a
high-average social competence in areas of persuasiveness,
expressiveness and assertiveness.
   Social skills were measured by a combination of written tests,
such as the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and evaluations of
the videotaped meetings.
   In the area of social skills, as opposed to intelligence, it's
more important to have parity.
   ``With social skills it doesn't work as well to have one person
incredibly socially skilled. The problem is if you have others who
aren't, they interfere with that person's ability to facilitate the
group process,'' Sternberg said.
   As with intelligence, when it comes to social competence, there
can be too much of a good thing. The reseachers called this
potential problem the ``eager beaver'' phenomenon, which they said
happens often enough to have a powerful effect statistically.
   ``If you have one person who is too much of an eager beaver, it
hurts the group product. The eager beaver tries to take over the
group but generally isn't the best person. They carry more weight
than they deserve,'' Sternberg said.
   After having been presented with a task, study participants were
allowed to work alone twice, alone first and then in a group, in a
group first and then alone, or both times in a group.
   The results demonstrated the value of diversity, said Sternberg.
Group products were superior to the efforts of those working alone,
with the best results achieved by those who worked in a group twice.
   The results not only demonstrate the importance of diversity,
they also point to a shortcoming in the educational system,
Sternberg said. ``In terms of education, almost all the training
children receive is individual. Doing homework is individual.
Everything is supposed to be individual.
   ``But when you are an adult, almost everything you do is as a
group or you need group approval. So I think we need to pay more
attention to teaching people how to work in a group.''

<DATELINE>PACK CREEK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A husband and wife who study brown
bears from a tree stand in the Alaska wilderness believe the huge
carnivores are among a small group of intelligent animals that are
playful all their lives.
   Brown bears, or grizzlies, play games with each other and appear
captivated by tree limbs, stumps, stones and tall grass. Their
hijinks don't stop as they grow from cubs into adults, says Bob
Fagen, an animal behavior specialist and associate professor of
biometry at the University of Alaska.
   ``It looks like the brown bears of Pack Creek may be one of the
rare species that play the same amount through all of their
lives,'' Fagen said.
   That puts them in the company of chimpanzees, lions, wolves and
several domestic animals, those Fagen calls ``a small select group
of intelligent, social, cultural species.
   ``The bears stand out because they don't have a very cooperative
relationship, like wolves.''
   Brown bears are reputed loners. At Pack Creek they chase each
other, snap and trade growls. Sometimes the growling turns into
fighting.
   Fagen has spent four summers at Pack Creek, 30 miles south of
Juneau on Admiralty Island, to observe about 30 bears that gather
to catch spawning salmon. His wife, Johanna, a biologist, has spent
three summers.
   In July and August, the Fagens live in a tent on an island off
the creek mouth with their 8-year-old son, Kevin, and a rotation of
graduate students who help keep track of the bears. They monitor
bears 12 to 15 hours a day from the tree stand, a tarp-covered
platform about 15 feet above ground.
   In addition to their studies of play, the Fagens monitor all the
bears' movements and interactions with people.
   The records help wildlife officials determine how bears are
affected by the crowds of people who show up every summer to
photograph them. Bears disturbed by clicking shutters, overflying
aircraft or other activity show changes in their behavior.
   ``The most sensitive indicator we know is play,'' Fagen said.
``Play tends to be inhibited by any kind of stressful or strange
experience.''
   Though one researcher at Pack Creek thought the bears' play was
inhibited when people were around, the Fagens say they have not
found the same result.
   Mrs. Fagen has watched cubs playing chasing games, and she saw
an older bear lie on its back and roll a huge, rotted stump atop
its upended paws. ``They are very oriented to objects. They like to
push and pull stones. They play-fight with a clump of grass or an
overhanging branch.''
   The Fagens saw an adult male and female sliding down a patch of
snow, apparently in fun, during the mating season.
   Mrs. Fagen also suspects that bears indulge in pleasures humans
might not recognize as such: rolling in dead fish, for instance.
She said the bears seem to appreciate smell, being attracted to
fish and gasoline and fond of rolling in a sawdust pile.
   The Fagens hope their study of play will add to broader research
into how bear behavior is molded.
   ``We want to look at the little ways and big ways that behavior
is passed between generations, other than genetically,'' Fagen said.
   The Fagens know that cubs tend to use their mothers' fishing
territory even after they leave her side at 2 to 3 years of age. By
tracking play and foraging patterns, they hope to find out if cubs
also adopt their mother's fishing techniques and personality traits.
   The studies at Pack Creek were pioneered in 1981 by Ken Post of
the U.S. Forest Service. ``After five more years here, we will be
observing the daughters of the first bears (observed),'' Fagen said.
   This research, too, may help wildlife managers. The Fagens hope
to find out if ``problem bears,'' those that are aggressive to
humans, learn the behavior from their mothers. If so, managers may
be able to better predict bears' behavior and avoid confrontations
between them and people.

that the effectiveness of any group can be predicted by the IQ of
its smartest member. Maximum IQ made more a difference than average
IQ, according to the study, which will be published in December in
the journal Intelligence.
   But there can be too much of a good thing. ``If the other
persons are too mediocre, they may not recognize or accept'' what
the brightest member has to say, Sternberg said. A vastly smarter
person may also hinder group success by appearing threatening to
other members.
   The researchers also found that an effective group will have a
high-average social competence in areas of persuasiveness,
expressiveness and assertiveness.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Grizzlies Among World's Most Playful Animals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PACK CREEK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A husband and wife who study brown
bears from a tree stand in the Alaska wilderness believe the huge
carnivores are among a small group of intelligent animals that are
playful all their lives.
   Brown bears, or grizzlies, play games with each other and appear
captivated by tree limbs, stumps, stones and tall grass. Their
hijinks don't stop as they grow from cubs into adults, says Bob
Fagen, an animal behavior specialist and associate professor of
biometry at the University of Alaska.
   ``It looks like the brown bears of Pack Creek may be one of the
rare species that play the same amount through all of their
lives,'' Fagen said.
   That puts them in the company of chimpanzees, lions, wolves and
several domestic animals, those Fagen calls ``a small select group
of intelligent, social, cultural species.''
   Mrs. Fagen has watched cubs playing chasing games, and she saw
an older bear lie on its back and roll a huge, rotted stump atop
its upended paws. The Fagens saw an adult male and female sliding
down a patch of snow, apparently in fun, during the mating season.
   Mrs. Fagen also suspects that bears indulge in pleasures humans
might not recognize: rolling in dead fish, for instance.
   The Fagens hope their study of play will add to broader research
into how bear behavior is molded. ``We want to look at the little
ways and big ways that behavior is passed between generations,
other than genetically,'' Fagen said.
   The Fagens know that cubs tend to use their mothers' fishing
territory even after they leave her side at 2 to 3 years of age. By
tracking play and foraging patterns, they hope to find out if cubs
also adopt their mother's fishing techniques and personality traits.

<HEAD>Lung Association Expands Flu Shot Recommendation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, the American Lung
Association is urging a yearly flu shot for anybody who lives with
elderly people or others at high risk for influenza.
   Previously, the association recommended the vaccine only for
people who themselves were at high risk.
   ``We must draw a ring of immunity around our senior citizens and
others who are most vulnerable, because 80 percent of them are not
getting vaccinated each year,'' Frederick Ruben of the lung
association's medical section, the American Thoracic Society, said
in a statement.
   Flu and pneumonia kill about 68,000 people a year in the United
States, more than any other infectious disease, the lung
association says.
   People at high risk for potentially fatal complications of
influenza include those 65 or older, residents of nursing homes or
other long-term care facilities, and adults and children older than
six months who have chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, kidney
ailments, anemia, infection with the AIDS virus or suppressed
immune systems, the lung association said.
   The category also includes children older than six months and
teen-agers up to 18 years who are receiving long-term aspirin
therapy, because of the risk of developing a potentially fatal
disorder called Reye's syndrome after flu infection, the
association said.
   Flu shots are also recommended for home care providers, such as
visiting nurses or volunteer workers, who are in daily contact with
high-risk people, the association said.

<HEAD>Vigorous Running Can Produce Internal Bleeding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One in five marathon runners in a recent study
showed evidence of internal bleeding after completing a race, and
runners who cover shorter distances might also be susceptible to
bleeding, say two doctors from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center
in Washington, D.C.
   Such bleeding, detected by testing for blood in urine and stool
samples before and after runners competed, can lead to anemia and
can also hide more serious problems, such as stomach and colon
cancer, the doctors said.
   Speaking at a meeting in New York of the American College of
Gastroenterology, the doctors advised any runners who detect signs
of bleeding, such as black stools or urine, to seek medical help.
   Older runners, who face a greater risk of colon or stomach
cancer, should be tested to see whether the bleeding is the result
of running or is an early warning sign of cancer, the doctors said.
   ``Runners seem to accept this as a matter of course,'' said Dr.
David Peura, chief of gastroenterology at Walter Reed. ``They don't
seem to be too concerned about these things.'' That is a mistake,
he said.
   Peura said that up to 80 percent of ultramarathoners, those who
run 100-mile races, begin to discharge blood in stool or urine
following their races.
   Puera and Dr. Frank Moses, also a gastroenterologist, said they
took blood samples from 120 runners before and after a recent
Marine Corps marathon. None were bleeding in the digestive tract
before the race, but about 20 percent had blood in their stools
after the race, Puera said.
   Moses has also studied the abdominal cramping and diarrhea that
many runners complain of and found that running causes the passage
of food to slow through the small intestine, but that it might
increase its speed through the colon, leading to diarrhea. That
remains to be studied, he said.

<HEAD>Metallic `Seeds' Implanted in Brain Aid Brain Tumor Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The implantation of heat-conducting metallic
``seeds'' into brain tumors should enable doctors to warm the
tumors, sensitizing them to anti-cancer drugs and radiation
treatments, a researcher says.
   Surgery is usually unable to remove brain tumors completely, and
the brain can tolerate only a certain level of anti-cancer drugs
and radiation. By heating the tumor, doctors hope they can increase
the likelihood that drugs and radiation will wipe it out, said Dr.
Sean Grady of the University of Washington School of Medicine in
Seattle.
   Grady said that initial animal tests had shown that tiny seeds
of a neodynium-iron-boron alloy could be inserted under the skull
and maneuvered with external magnets into brain tumors.
   Preliminary studies, reported in Chicago at the annual meeting
of the American College of Surgeons this week, showed that ``the
seeds would not damage normal brain tissue'' as they were
maneuvered into position, Grady said.
   ``Tumors occur in many different shapes, so it was important to
find out if the seeds could be moved easily in different
directions,'' Grady said. ``The studies suggest that you could move
the seeds into and back out of each limb or extension of the
tumor,'' he said.
   The next experiments are intended to determine whether the seeds
can be heated to desired temperatures, he said.
   He said he doubted that the new method would replace
chemotherapy or radiation, but ``we might find that the seeds will
become another modality for the treatment of malignant brain
tumors.''

   Grand Metropolitan PLC shareholders today
overwhelmingly approved the British company's $5.23 billion
takeover bid for Pillsbury Co.
   At a special meeting, the shareholders also voted in favor of
Grand Metropolitan's plan to sell off its Inter-Continental chain
of 100 hotels to the Saison Group of Japan for $2.15 billion and to
sell new Grand Metropolitan shares to existing shareholders to
raise funds toward the Pillsbury offer.
   The Minneapolis-based Pillsbury, which controls the Burger King
restaurant chain and whose products include Green Giant vegetables
and Haagen Dazs ice cream, rejected Grand Met's offer of $60 a
share in cash last Tuesday, saying it was considering ways of
remaining independent.
   Johnny Thompson, Pillsbury's vice president for public
relations, said Monday morning he could not immediately comment on
the Grand Met shareholders' action. He said a reporter's telephone
call was the first notification he had of the action.
   Grand Met launched the surprise offer Oct. 4, just five days
after announcing the Inter-Continental sale. The company said these
moves were part of its strategy to focus on foods, liquor and
retailing and to expand its interests in the United States and
Japan.
   Grand Met's brands include J&B Scotch whisky and Gilbey's gin.
   Grand Met Chairman Allen Sheppard said at the special
shareholders meeting, ``We don't think we will fail at this
takeover ... because we feel it is a full and fair value offer.''
   In rejecting the Grand Met offer, Pillsbury said it was
considering several options, including a one-time special dividend,
a sales of some of the company's businesses, a leveraged buyout and
the sale of an interest in the Pillsbury to a third party.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out a
company and then pay off the debt with the target company's cash
flow or the sale of its assets.

   A fight over Kraft Inc. began today as the
food maker turned down a $11 billion takeover bid from Philip
Morris Cos. and said it would undertake a $13.59 billion
recapitalization plan.
   The Kraft proposal would be the largest corporate restructuring
ever, would force Kraft to sell off some lines, and would boost the
company's debt more than tenfold.
   ``We should take action to maximize shareholder value rather
than accept an inadequate offer,'' said Kraft Chairman and Chief
Executive John M. Richman in a statement released late Sunday. ``We
strongly believe the $90 takeover bid (by Philip Morris) ...
undervalues Kraft.''
   Richman said the recapitalization plan would have a
significantly higher value for shareholders by boosting the value
of the company's stock to $110 per share.
   Philip Morris spokesman Tom Ricke, reached by telephone in New
York late Sunday, said he could not immediately comment on the move
by Kraft.
   But it was expected the tobacco and food products company, which
has an excess of cash on hand, would answer Kraft with a higher bid.
   Philip Morris indicated last week it was ready for a fight,
filing a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago challenging
Kraft's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense. The pill makes a
hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
   The Kraft recapitalization would include a distribution in cash
and securities of about $98 per share and retention of common stock
interest, Richman said. The market would determine the value of
Kraft stock after the distribution, he said.
   Kraft stock closed at $92 a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading on Friday.
   Philip Morris offered a week ago to buy Kraft for $90 a share in
cash for each of Kraft's nearly 123.6 million shares outstanding,
or a total of about $11 billion.
   The Kraft recapitalization plan, at $110 a share, values the
company at about $13.59 billion.
   That Kraft stock rose above the $90 offer is ``a clear signal
that investors see the (Philip Morris) bid as low,'' Richman said.
   Richman said the recapitalization plan would be presented to the
company's board of directors soon, and then would be submitted to
stockholders at a special meeting.
   He said the plan would involve selling some Kraft businesses,
but that core brands representing about 80 percent of the company's
profits would be kept.
   The plan also involves bank borrowings of more than $6.8 billion
and the public sale of some $3 billion of debt. Kraft has already
begun negotiations on some of the transactions, and Goldman, Sachs
and Co. has said it is confident it can place the debt, Kraft said.
   While Richman said the company would proceed with the
recapitalization, he left open the possibility that the board could
accept another bid.
   ``If someone comes forward with a transaction that would be more
desirable than the restructuring plan, we will negotiate and your
board will give full consideration to such a transaction,'' Richman
said.
   The New York Times reported last week the leveraged buyout
specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. might be offering its
services to Kraft management.
   Sources quoted by the Times said Kohlberg Kravis was financially
capable of competing against Philip Morris. However, today Kohlberg
Kravis took on an even bigger deal, announcing it would begin a
tender offer of more than $20 billion for RJR Nabisco Inc.
   A combination of Kraft and Philip Morris would create the
world's largest maker of consumer goods and would decrease Philip
Morris' heavy dependence on profitable but stagnating cigarette
sales.
   Philip Morris, best known for Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Benson &
Hedges and Merit cigarettes, took over General Foods Corp., the
maker of Jell-O, Maxwell House, Kool-Aid, Shake 'N Bake and Oscar
Mayer, in 1985 for $5.7 billion.
   The addition of Kraft would bring such names as Velveeta,
Thousand Island dressings, Cheez Whiz, Breyer's, Light 'n' Lively,
Sealtest and Frusen Gladje to the Philip Morris lineup.

   The stampede of bids for food companies
intensified today as the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. announced it would begin a $20.28 billion tender offer for RJR
Nabisco Inc.
   The Kohlberg Kravis announcement came four days after managers
of the food and tobacco products company said they were considering
taking the manufacturer private for nearly $17 billion.
   ``Management has decided that the company should be sold. Our
offer is a better one,'' Henry Kravis, a partner in the New
York-based leveraged buyout specialist firm, said in a statement.
   The Kohlberg Kravis offer was for $90 a share in cash and
securities, compared with the management buyout proposal of $75 a
share in cash.
   There was no immediate comment from RJR Nabisco.
   However, investors reacted enthusiastically to news of the
Kohlberg Kravis bid. RJR Nabisco stock shot up $10.37{ a share to
$87.12{ in early New York Stock Exchange trading today.
   Kohlberg Kravis had been expected to enter the whirlwind of bids
for food companies that began Oct. 4 with a $5.23 billion bid for
Pillsbury Co. by Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British company.
   Kravis said his company had raised an equity pool of $5.6
billion for leveraged buyouts. In a leveraged buyout, investors
borrow heavily to purchase a company and then pay off the debt with
the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.
   Securities analysts said last week the plan by RJR Nabisco
management was a pre-emptive strike to protect the company that
manufactures many well-known brand names, including Winston and
Camel cigarettes and Oreo cookies, from an unwanted suitor.
   RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson and other executives made
their announcement after Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered more than
$11 billion for Kraft Inc., the processed foods manufacturer.
   Kohlberg Kravis had been thought to be considering a bid for
Kraft, which late Sunday rejected the Philip Morris bid and
announced a $13.59 billion recapitalization plan.
   Kohlberg Kravis carried out the largest leveraged buyout in U.S.
history in 1986 when it took the food and consumer products
conglomerate Beatrice Cos. private for $6.1 billion.
   The investment firm is also leading a group that is attempting
to acquire the publishing giant Macmillan Inc. for $2.5 billion.
British publisher Robert Maxwell, who also seeks to buy Macmillan,
is fighting that bid in a Delaware court.
   Kohlberg Kravis recently withdrew a $5.03 billion bid for the
supermarket operator Kroger Co. after Kroger rejected the offer and
said it would proceed with a financial restructuring.
   In its statement today, Kohlberg Kravis said its offer for RJR
Nabisco was conditioned upon approval of RJR Nabisco's board. The
investment firm said it would begin its tender offer later this
week, but did not specify exactly when it would begin.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A. today
announced it would assemble a new passenger car in an expansion of
the Japanese automaker's assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn.
   But in a news release received in Detroit, the Japan-based
company did not say how much the expansion would cost or provide
other details.
   Nissan now makes the Sentra car and light truck at the plant
southeast of Nashville.
   Nissan Motor President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry
Benefield said a task force of company officials from Tennessee and
Japan will begin a study soon about the plant expansion, the new
car and how many new employees will be needed.
   ``We have been asking for the opportunity to expand our capacity
for some time,'' Benefield said. ``We are very happy and proud that
our board of directors and parent company have given all of us at
Nissan in Tennessee this vote of confidence.''
   The company's board of directors approved the expansion Oct. 15,
but decided to withhold the announcement until today, spokesman
David Fox said.
   The Smyrna plant, with a 3,200-employee work force, was designed
in 1980 with room for expansion. The company said as early as last
February it was looking into expanding the factory.
   Today's announcement is the latest in a series of moves Nissan
has made in the United States this year.
   In April, Nissan approved spending $31.1 million to begin
producing bumpers and assembling engines and truck axles at the
Tennessee plant.
   In September, Nissan and Ford Motor Co. announced a joint
venture to produce minivans at Ford's Avon Lake, Ohio, truck plant.
   Last week, Nissan Research and Development Inc. broke ground for
a $50 million research and design facility in Farmington Hills,
Mich., northwest of Detroit. Officials said among its projects
would be designing a new vehicle for the U.S. market.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
session dominated by takeover and buyout news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.67 tto

   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.31 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Takeover developments from late last week and the weekend sent
several prominent stocks higher.
   Kraft led the active list, up 10{ at 102{. The company rejected
a $90-a-share takeover bid from Philip Morris, and proposed instead
a recapitalization plan it valued at at least $110 a share.
   RJR Nabisco climbed 10} to 87{. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
said it had organized a company to offer $90 a share for RJR, which
said last week it was considering a management buyout.
   West Point Pepperell rose 4[ to 49]. William Farley, chairman of
Fruit Of The Loom Inc., began a $48-a-share bid for the company.
   Given the frantic deal-making pace, analysts said, other stocks
tended to suffer from neglect.
   The takeover wave has helped carry stock prices lately to new
highs since the crash last fall. But some observers worry that it
might eventually lead to trouble for the market, by heaping huge
new amounts of debt on an already-extended economy.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
unchanged at 159.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .36 at 305.71.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.31 to
2,183.50, setting a new 1988 high. For the week, the average
chalked up a net gain of 50.32 points.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the NYSE, with

<TEXT>
   Farley Inc., parent of the Fruit of the Loom
underwear company, today launched a tender offer for West
Point-Pepperell Inc. that values the textile giant at about $1.4
billion.
   Farley, one of the nation's largest privately owned
conglomerates, is offering $48 a share in cash for each of
Pepperell's 29.4 million outstanding shares.
   In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pepperell
jumped $4.25 a share to $49.50.
   William Farley, who heads the Chicago-based concern, said in a
letter to Pepperell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph L.
Lanier Jr. that he hoped to ``move forward on a constructive,
friendly basis.''
   The offer was not entirely unexpected. In May, Farley sought
government permission to acquire up to 25 percent of Pepperell's
stock. So far, he has spent $88 million for a 9.8 percent stake in
the West Point, Ga.-based company.
   Pepperell spokesman Donald Downs said the company would have no
comment until it had studied the offer. Farley said had telephoned
him months ago ``and indicated he preferred to remain independent.''
   Farley said his company already has taken legal action to
challenge Georgia's anti-takeover statutes as well as Pepperell's
poison pill. Last June Pepperell strengthened its poison pill,
designed to make unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive.
   The lawsuits would be dropped, however, if Pepperell agrees to
work with Farley on a friendly basis, Farley said in a statement.
   Pepperell, which manufacturs brand name products includiung
Arrow shirts and Martex towels, acquired textile rival J.P. Stevens
& Co. earlier this year for $1.2 billion and then split up Stevens'
assets with a rival suitor. Pepperell was left with most of
Stevens' linen and towel operations, giving the company about 25
percent of the nation's home fashion textile market.
   Farley has a $300 million war chest for acquisitions,
accumulated from a bond issue earlier this year, but has indicated
he wants to keep two-thirds of it in reserve for other investments.
   He said he would finance the Pepperell takeover with a
combination of bank financing and high-yield ``junk bonds'' offered
through the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banking firm.
   If the bid is successful, Farley said he would try to refinance
about $1.1 billion of Pepperell debt, much of it due to the Stevens
acquisition.
   The company's textile looms are not compatible with Fruit of the
Loom's products, so the takeover would not help the underwear
company's battle to meet demand.
   In addition to Fruit of the Loom, the nation's largest underwear
company, Farley also operates Acme Boot and Doehler-Jarvis.

Fruit Of The Loom Inc., began a $48-a-share bid for the company.
   Given the frantic deal-making pace, analysts said, other stocks
tended to suffer from neglect.
   The takeover wave has helped carry stock prices lately to new
highs since the crash last fall. But some observers worry that it
might eventually lead to trouble for the market, by heaping huge
new amounts of debt on an already-extended economy.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.49 to 158.93. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .64 at 305.43.

<HEAD>Consent Decree Ends Legal Battle Between Colorado Card Company and
Hallmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards today agreed to replace a line of
greeting cards that had been challenged in a lawsuit by Blue
Mountain Arts, a tiny Colorado card company that had accused
Hallmark of copying its card design.
   The consent decree filed in Denver U.S. District Court ends the
legal dispute between the two companies that began when Blue
Mountain Arts of Boulder filed a $50 million lawsuit in July 1986
against Hallmark.
   The card war had been scheduled to go to trial Jan. 2 in federal
court here. At issue were a line of cards, featuring watercolor art
and free-verse messages, which Blue Mountain created and Hallmark
allegedly copied.
   Under terms of the consent decree, Hallmark will stop publishing
its Personal Touch line of cards, discontinue use of the Personal
Touch name and take steps to repurchase the cards from Hallmark
stores.
   Blue Mountain had alleged that Hallmark's Personal Touch line of
greeting cards was deceptively similar to Blue Mountain's
``Airebrush Feelings'' and ``WaterColor Feelings.''
   The decree also stipulates a monetary settlement, but neither
Hallmark nor Blue Mountain would disclose the amount.
   Last week, Hallmark lost a bid in the U.S. Supreme Court to
overturn an injunction prohibiting Hallmark from distributing the
83 cards in its Personal Touch line.
   ``We are absolutely thrilled with this decree,'' said Susan
Polis Schutz, poet and co-founder of Blue Mountain. ``This is
important not only for us, but for all artists and businesses.''
   Bob Gall, general manager of Blue Mountain, said that while the
decree requires Hallmark to pay a damage settlement, that is not
the decree's most important aspect.
   ``We feel the emphasis in the case is not money, but that
artists and businesses around the country can feel free to create
without fear of being copied,'' he said.
   Hallmark said one of the key points in the agreement with Blue
Mountain was that it will introduce a new card line with a new name
to replace Personal Touch. The company said it agreed not to
develop products similar in appearance to Blue Mountain's.
   The Kansas City card manufacturer also said it agreed in the
settlement not to pressure Hallmark outlets to refuse Blue Mountain
products for sale. And it said the agreement provides that neither
side admit liability or wrongdoing.
   ``We have found common ground with Blue Mountain because we are
interested in promoting fair competition while protecting both
companies' trademarks,'' Irv Hockaday, president and chief
executive officer of Hallmark, said.
   Blue Mountain attorney Hary Melkonian of Los Angeles said the
consent decree was ``a convenient way to resolve the lawsuit
without the ordeal of a trial, since little else could have been
gained.''

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were moderately lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
disappointment over slack export business and improved growing
conditions in South America.
   The soybean market appeared to be leading the grain markets
lower on reports of fairly heavy weekend showers in Brazil and
forecasts for more rain by midweek in both Brazil and Argentina,
analysts said.
   The generally slow pace of grain export sales continued to exert
pressure on corn and wheat prices.
   ``An increase in exports is what we need in both markets to get
things rolling,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   He said the corn market remained nervous about the effect on
export demand of aflatoxin, a naturally-occurring cancer-causing
substance that has turned up in some newly harvested corn.
   At least one ship had to unload corn bound for overseas after
federal inspectors found aflatoxin in the shipment, and Japan is
weighing restrictions on U.S. corn contaminated by aflatoxin.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.15{ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 2 cents lower with December at $2.81{ a bushel; oats were
1{ cents to 3\ cents lower with December at $2.47 a bushel;
soybeans were \ cent to 6} cents lower with November at $7.69 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly
lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .40 cent higher with December at
74.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .45 cent
higher with October at 81.90 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
.42 cent lower with December at 41.45 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .37 cent lower to .55 cent higher with February at
49.35 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Friday while pork futures
were mostly higher.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs this week
increased by eight to total 933, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc.
said Monday.
   The latest increase follows a rise of 11 the previous week. A
year ago, the count was 1,130, Baker Hughes saiod.
   The count is the widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas had the largest increase
with 11 followed by Kansas, seven; Michigan, three; California,
two; and Colorado, one.
   Oklahoma saw the largest drop with nine, with Pennsylvania
slipping by five; North Dakota, three; Wyoming, two; and Louisiana
and Ohio, one each.

<TEXT>
   Penn Central Corp. said Monday it had signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Republic American Corp. in a $249
million merger.
   The companies said in a joint statement they expect to complete
the deal in early 1989, assuming that they receive required
approvals from regulators and the holders of two-thirds of Republic
American's outstanding common stock.
   Republic American, which sells workers' compensation insurance
in California, has about 18.4 million common shares outstanding.
   Penn Central already owns 14.3 percent of those common shares
and has committed to pay $15.75 per share in cash for the rest, or
about $249 million.
   Pen Central, which has its headquarters here, is a
telecommunications and defense systems company. It plans to merge
Republic American with a newly formed Penn Central subsidiary.
   American Financial Corp., a Cincinnati holding company
controlled by financier Carl Lindner Jr., owns 31 percent of Penn
Central's common shares and 38.6 percent of Republic American's
common shares. American Financial, whose interests include banking
and insurance holdings, has agreed to vote all its stock of
Republic American for the merger.
   The agreement revises Penn Central's earlier proposal to acquire
Republic American, announced in July. That move provoked objections
in court by Republic American stockholders. Under the original
proposal, Penn Central said it would give Republic American
stockholders 0.65 of a Penn Central common share for each
outstanding Republic American common share. The market price of
Penn Central's common stock was then about $22.50 per share.
   The two companies announced Oct. 13 that the Republic American
stockholders who sued to challenge the original proposal have
agreed, subject to confirmation and court approval, to settle their
suits in light of the new proposal.

   Martin Marietta Corp. said Monday its
third-quarter earnings surged nearly fourfold, mainly because of a
gain on the sale of its interest in a British-based computer
services company.
   The aerospace and defense company reported earnings of $202.8
million, or $3.82 per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30
compared with a profit of $55.6 million, or $1.02 per share, a year
earlier.
   The latest results include a onetime after-tax gain of $135.7
million, or $2.55 per share, from the sale of the company's 68.3
percent interest in Hoskyns Group PLC, a London-based computer
services concern.
   Without the gain, the company said its earnings per share for
the quarter would have risen 23 percent from a year ago.
   Sales for the quarter rose 10.6 percent to $1.46 billion from
$1.32 billion from the same period in 1987.
   For the first nine months, earnings nearly doubled to $335.2
million, or $6.30 per share, compared with $171.3 million, or $3.13
per share, in the same period a year ago. Sales for the nine months
rose 9.1 percent to $4.20 billion from $3.85 billion in 1987.

<HEAD>GTE Reports 5 Percent Profit Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Corp.'s third-quarter profit rose 5 percent despite a $55
million pre-tax charge to cover the cost of reorganization and
streamlining, the Stamford, Conn.-based phone company said Monday.
   For the first time since mid-1986, GTE's operating results did
not include losses from US Sprint Communications Co., which it owns
equally with United Telecommunications Inc.
   Since GTE has agreed to sell a majority of its interest in US
Sprint to United Telecommunications at the start of 1989, it
accounted for the company's results differently in the third
quarter and was able to absorb the loss with money in a previously
established reserve, spokesman Harvey Greisman said.
   US Sprint's pre-tax loss in the quarter was $19 million, down
sharply from $165 million in the third quarter of 1987. US Sprint,
created in July 1986 from two predecessors, is the third biggest
long-distance company after American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and
MCI Communications Corp.
   GTE said it earned $313 million, or 91 cents a share, up from
$297 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5
percent to $4 billion from $3.8 billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, GTE said its
profit rose 15 percent to $898 million, or $2.62 a share, from $785
million, or $2.30 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7 percent
to $12.2 billion from $11.3 billion.
   The nine-month period of 1987 included an after-tax charge of
$39 million for a writedown at US Sprint, net of gains from certain
other actions.
   The $55 million charge will cover the previously announced
consolidation of GTE's seven telephone operating companies into one
centralized general office that will oversee four regional
headquarters in Florida, Indiana, California and Texas.

   Enron Gas Marketing Inc. has signed an agreement
to supply Pacific Gas and Electric Co. with up to 100 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day for 10 years, the companies announced
Monday.
   The estimated value of the transaction, based on current prices
and anticipated volumes, is in excess of $500 million. The gas
prices to be paid under the agreement will be periodically
renegotiated to reflect the market value of long-term natural gas
supplies, officials said.
   San Francisco-based PG&E will transport the gas to its
California system through El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s pipelines.
   ``This long-term purchase is an important addition to PG&E's
core portfolio supply,'' said John A. Sproul, PG&E's executive vice
president and general manager of its gas supply business unit.
Long-term case portfolio supply sources with take flexibility and
competitive prices are preferred by PG&E and are purchasd prior to
more costly or less reliable supplies, he said.
   John J. Esslinger, president of Enron Gas Marketing, a
subsidiary of Houston-based Enron Corp., said the agreement
represents a first ``long-term, firm sales agreement with a West
Coast customer. We are confident of our ability to serve PG&E
reliably at competitive prices, and we appreciate the confidence it
has placed in Enron.''
   PG&E is the largest investor-owned gas and electic utility in
the United States, serving more than 3.2 million gas and 4 million
electric customers in a 94,000-square-mile area of northern
California.
   Enron Gas Marketing is a non-jurisdictional supplier of natural
gas to numerous direct-use and resale customers throughout the
country.

<HEAD>Texas Citrus Growers Bouncing Back From '83 Freeze</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>McALLEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grapefruit gourmands, relax.
   ``Ruby Red'' hasn't disappeared from the market. It just has a
new name: ``Texas Ruby-Sweet.''
   So has the much-heralded, redder ``Rio Red'' variety, which
first hit the market last year. It is now promoted along with its
older crimson cousin, the ``Star Ruby'' under the new name of ``Rio
Star.''
   The name changes are part of an aggressive new campaign from the
Texas citrus industry, bouncing back five years after a rare, hard
freeze that wiped out groves and scared many growers out of the
grapefruit and orange business.
   The new crop is just beginning to hit the market. This year,
producers say, they finally have enough fruit again to promote
Texas citrus in Japan, Europe and throughout the United States.
   So intent is the Texas industry on recapturing its lost market,
some growers are shipping almost all the fruit they have out of the
state, much to the dismay of some of the folks back home.
   ``We're trying to reach people who really like to eat
grapefruit,'' said Texas citrus promoter Mary Bentley McKeever,
adding that there is a touch of snob appeal: ``Do you want to say
the connoisseurs?
   ``We are very interested in presenting Texas citrus as a very
premium grapefruit, getting it out of the generic category of
grapefruit,'' Ms. McKeever said. She is marketing manager for
TexaSweet Citrus Advertising Inc., the McAllen-based promotional
arm of the Texas citrus industry.
   ``By establishing the new categories that we have for our red
grapefruit that's produced exclusively in Texas, we really feel
like we can have some distinction for Texas,'' she said.
   The state's citrus industry is concentrated in its three
southernmost counties in the Rio Grande Valley. Rio Star will
represent the two reddest varieties grown there, while Ruby-Sweet
will refer to the lighter Ruby Red, Henderson Ruby and Ray Ruby.
   The Texas industry is trying to make up ground given up to its
Florida competition since the 1983 freeze, particularly in the
Midwestern market. Florida produces more than 10 times more
grapefruit than Texas and 100 times the Texas orange crop.
   But Texas contributed 20 percent of the nation's total fresh
grapefruit shipments in the past year because of the state's
emphasis on fresh fruit, said Leslie Whitlock, manager of the Texas
Valley Citrus Committee, also based in McAllen.
   TexaSweet began its comeback last year with promotions in the
Midwest, especially Cincinnati, where it shipped nearly all of the
limited quantity of the new Rio Red variety.
   The promotional effort annoyed some Texans who found they could
not buy the new, improved fruit with red meat, developed in Weslaco
by Dr. Richard Hensz of Texas A&I University. Kroger Co. had
shipped it all to Ohio.
   Whitlock said the young Rio Red trees will produce more this
year, but still have not matured enough to make the fruit easy to
find in local stores.
   Also contributing to the local shortage are overseas sales of
the largest, most expensive grapefruit.
   ``We're selling the large-size fruit in Japan,'' said Ken
Martin, president and general manager of Warehouse Farms Inc., the
Rio Grande Valley's largest citrus packing company. In Japanese
gift stores, Martin said, people have been known to pay as much as
$25 for one grapefruit, and routinely pay $2 to $2.50 per fruit.
   Shipping costs and tariffs make the fruit expensive in Japan.
   A survey by the Florida Department of Citrus earlier this year
found that consumers believe white grapefruit is the most tart
while pink and red are sweeter, according to an article in the Oct.
8 edition of ``The Packer,'' a national weekly publication of the
fruit and vegetable industry.
   The Packer reported the survey's finding that ``red is
considered sweetest, although it doesn't appear to be widely
available. The researchers found a low awareness of Texas
grapefruit relative to Florida and California. There is some
awareness of red grapefruit, but only among heavy users.''
   The Texas industry's new campaign features a poster with a stop
light and a red grapefruit half where the red light should be.
   ``Stop and REDiscover the sweeter, juicier grapefruit from
Texas,'' the poster promoting Ruby-Sweet reads.
   It has taken Texas citrus growers a few years to recover from
the trauma of the 1983 freeze, which reduced a $110 million
industry to almost nothing the next year. Of a total of 69,200
acres in production before the freeze, only 21,800 acres survived.
   By the early spring of 1987, when the last official tree count
was conducted, there were 30,400 acres, including some still too
young to produce fruit. It takes four to eight years for the trees
to start producing appreciable harvests.
   ``This will be the first year of significant production of young
trees that were planted since the freeze,'' Whitlock said.
   Seventy percent of the new trees are the Rio Red variety, he
said.
   While volume this year is expected to be less than half the Rio
Grande Valley's total pre-freeze crop, the wholesale value of the
fruit is projected to be worth $83 million to $85 million, Whitlock
said.
   Growers expect to earn 80 percent of what they made from the
$110 million pre-freeze crop with less than half the production,
because of their emphasis on fresh fruit.
   Fresh fruit sells for about twice as much as fruit sold for
juice.
   Whitlock said the quality of the fresh fruit has improved
because growers who are serious about grapefruit and oranges stayed
in the industry after the freeze, while many absentee growers and
others less dedicated to citrus dropped out.

   If those trick-or-treaters who show up
at your door look you in the eye instead of the kneecap this year,
don't be surprised.
   The masquerading and tomfoolery of Halloween isn't just for kids
anymore.
   Like so many of life's finer things, the holiday has been
yuppified _ and has therefore become a big business.
   ``It's no longer a children's holiday. The majority of dollars
are spent on adults,'' said Jack Sheehan, owner of the Costumer in
upstate New York.
   According to Hallmark Cards Inc., an estimated $300 million will
be spent in the United States just on costumes for All Hallows' Eve
1988 _ which pretty much means the days of drumming up a Halloween
costume in a last-minute dash to the attic or basement are over.
   ``We've discovered that the single most important factor for an
adult in determining whether he or she has a good time at Halloween
is whether they find the right costume,'' said Michael DeMent, a
spokesman for Hallmark in Kansas City, Mo.
   Sheehan, who also rents costumes for theatrical productions,
does about 40 percent of his business for the annual holiday, which
traces its origins to the Druids in 700 B.C.
   Fifty million American adults are expected to attend Halloween
parties this year, an increase of 25 percent over the last three
years, and 28 million Halloween cards will be given in 1988,
Hallmark says.
   ``It's the second-largest adult party-giving occasion in the
United States,'' said DeMent. New Year's Eve is the top adult
partying occasion.
   There are several theories on the increased interest in
Halloween.
   ``One is that people are so busy with work and family and
community activities that it's almost like we have to give
ourselves permission to have fun. Halloween's kind of made for
that,'' DeMent said.
   ``I would say in general there has been a big increase in the
last several years in the value people place on fun and enjoyment
in life,'' said Lynn R. Kahle, a psychologist and professor of
consumer behavior at the University of Oregon in Eugene. ``Fun has
become a much greater priority for people.''
   Why the surge in Halloween buying?
   ``People buy things to represent their values,'' Kahle said.
``So it makes sense to me that people would be involved in (buying)
things that are especially fun.''
   Halloween also provides an opportunity to escape.
   ``The society we live in today is a very fast-moving, rapid
society. This is an opportunity to go back to our childhood ... to
a time when we think that life was a lot easier. It also gives us
an opportunity to be anything that we want to be for that one
day,'' said Philip Morris, head of Morris Costumes Inc., which
distributes and manufactures costumes in Charlotte, N.C., Chicago
and Los Angeles.
   ``It's controlled scream therapy where once a year you can
scream and be totally acceptable in doing it,'' added Sheehan, who
stocks 35,000 costumes.
   Morris said his company manufactured 60,000 Freddy Krueger masks
of the gruesome character from ``Nightmare on Elm Street.'' They
could have sold twice that number, he said.
   Children and adults alike are wearing more professional
costumes, Sheehan said. Mothers who in years past sewed a costume
for their children are working today and don't have time to make
them anymore.
   The rise of the young urban professional and discretionary
income also means people have more cash to spend on themselves,
Sheehan believes.
   Halloween can't compete with other holidays, like Christmas or
Presidents Day, when it comes to general sales, according to the
National Association of Retail Merchants. Granted, people don't
rush out and buy a microwave or clothes for Halloween.
   But a look in any store after Sept. 1 is a strong indication
that Halloween has its place in retail sales.
   As for Halloween candy, it doesn't matter whether its for kids
or adults.
   ``Halloween is one of the largest candy-selling holidays of the
year,'' said Philip Kimball of the National Confectioners
Association.
   A survey commissioned by the the association found that 93
percent of households with children under 12 will participate in
Halloween festivities either by trick or treating or giving treats
away, Kimball said.

<HEAD>Reports Net Loss of $517 Million, Imposes Debt Payment Moratorium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCorp., a financial services organization, said
Monday it lost $517 million in the third quarter and that its board
had placed a moratorium on payment of its outstanding debt and
preferred stock dividends.
   The loss reflects a ``substantial addition to the allowance for
possible loan losses, a large provision for possible losses on
assets acquired upon foreclosure, and other costs associated with
asset quality pressures,'' the company reported.
   The moratorium included payment of principal and interest on all
parent company publicly and privately placed indebtedness for
borrowed money.
   The moratorium which affects approximately $470 million in
outstanding debt was effective Oct. 21 and will remain in place
indefinitely, officials said.
   The moratorium permits MCorp to marshal it assets in its
recapitalization proposal, pending before the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   The loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 compares with a net loss
of $73.7 million for the same period in 1987.
   The company had net income of $46.2 million for the second
quarter of 1988, including a $215 million gain from sale of its 80
percent interest in MTech.
   As a result of the loss, officials said that obligations under
certain debt covenants prohibit MCorp from declaring dividends
unless it returns to profitability or obtains waivers from
bankholders.
   ``The moratorium does not affect the company's MBanks or
customers,'' said Gene H. Bishop, MCorp chairman and chief
executive officer. ``Business will continue as usual.''
   He said the board's action was designed ``to conserve maximum
resources at the parent company'' so that they can be ``used in
connection with the recapitalization of the company and its banking
subsidiaries.''
   Separately, MCorp officials said the board of governors of the
Federal Reserve System had issued a temporary order directing the
company not to declare dividends on its common or preferred shares
or otherwise engage in any transaction that could result in the
dissipation of assets of the parent company without the approval of
the Federal Reserve.
   The decision to suspend payments of dividends and to declare the
debt moratorium did not result from the Federal Reserve order,
company officials said, and MCorp is in compliance with the order.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp., the largest U.S. oil company, said
today its profit rose 15 percent in the third quarter despite a
slight decline in revenue because of lower crude oil prices.
   Exxon said it earned $1.26 billion, or 93 cents a share, up from
$1.07 billion, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell
0.2 percent to $21.89 billion from $21.93 billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Exxon said its
profit rose 18 percent to $3.88 billion, or $2.89 a share, from
$3.29 billion, or $2.31 a share. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to $65.5
billion from $61.5 billion.
   Exxon said improved profit margins on its refined products and
record earnings from chemicals were principal factors in the
improved profits.
   The improved margins on refined products were made possible by
relatively firm prices for the products, combined with lower costs
for the crude oil that goes into them, Exxon said. Margins on
refining and marketing had been ``severely depressed'' a year
earlier, the company said.
   However, weak crude oil prices depressed earnings from
exploration and production operations, it said.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
session dominated by takeover and buyout news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.80 to 2,178.70
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 558 up, 832 down and
514 unchanged.
   Takeover developments from late last week and the weekend sent
several prominent stocks higher.
   Kraft jumped 10| to 102|. The company rejected a $90-a-share
takeover bid from Philip Morris, and proposed instead a
recapitalization plan it valued at at least $110 a share.
   RJR Nabisco climbed 8~ to 85|. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
said it had organized a company to offer $90 a share for RJR, which
said last week it was considering a management buyout.
   West Point Pepperell rose 4\ to 49{. William Farley, chairman of
Fruit Of The Loom Inc., began a $48-a-share bid for the company.
   Chicago Pacific gained 13] to 56}, and Maytag fell 2{ to 24,
after Maytag announced plans to acquire Chicago Pacific.
   Given the frantic deal-making pace, analysts said, other stocks
tended to suffer from neglect.
   The takeover wave has helped carry stock prices lately to new
highs since the crash last fall. But some observers worry that it
might eventually lead to trouble for the market, by heaping huge
new amounts of debt on an already-extended economy.
   Energy stocks were weak as the price of oil tumbled. Amoco
dropped 1| to 74\; Chevron | to 46]; Mobil { to 45}, and Atlantic
Richfield 1\ to 81{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost

   Stock prices fell Monday on the London Stock
Exchange as worries about interest rates persisted.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 10.9
points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,848.4. It had been as high as 1,856.5
in the afternoon.
   Volume was light, as 464 million shares changed hands, compared
with the 484.2 million shares Friday.
   Share prices were marked down across the board in the absence of
news affecting speculative situations, a major force giving the
market its recent buoyancy, dealers said.
   ``We're just wandering around right now without much
direction,'' one equity salesman contended.
   Analysts said the possibility that interest rates may be headed
higher weighed on the market which is looking toward Thursday's
scheduled release of British trade figures.
   Oil company shares fell on disappointment that the three-day
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries committee talks in
Madrid failed to come up with a new production ceiling for the
13-member cartel.
   Mining finance and precious metal shares dipped in sympathy with
oils, dealers said, pulling the broader market lower.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 9.9 points at
1,499.4 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 4.71

<HEAD>NWA's Profit Up 33.2 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NWA Inc. reported that strong passenger
traffic helped to boost its third-quarter profit 33.2 percent from
a year earlier and to lift quarterly earnings over $100 million for
the first time.
   The parent of Northwest Airlines said Monday that its net income
in the three months ended Sept. 30 jumped to $116.3 million, or
$3.98 a share, from $87.3 million, or $2.89 a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $1.61 billion from $1.44 billion.
   ``These results are the highest quarterly profits in our 62-year
history and mark the first time net earnings for a quarter exceeded
$100 million,'' said NWA Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier.
   ``Our third-quarter results were characterized by strong
passenger traffic and improved yield _ the measurement of revenue
per passenger mile,'' Rothmeier said in a statement.
   A passenger mile represents one paying passenger flown one mile
and is used to determine an airline's capacity.
   Northwest had a 5.6 percent increase in passenger traffic over
the third quarter of 1987, Rothmeier said.
   In the first nine months of the year, NWA earned $101.1 million,
or $3.47 a share, compared with $103 million, or $3.59 a share, in
the year-earlier period. The third-quarter profit offset a net loss
in the first half of the year.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $4.23 billion from $3.93 billion a
year earlier.
   Rothmeier also announced that NWA has reached an agreement in
principle to add Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International as
owners of PARS, a computer reservations system co-owned by
Northwest and Trans World Airlines Inc.
   The final agreement is expected to expand the PARS network to
more than 3,500 travel agencies in Canada in addition to more than
6,300 U.S. travel agencies now served by PARS, Rothmeier said.

   Third-quarter profits rose 15 percent at Exxon Corp. and 24
percent at Atlantic Richfield Co. as lower crude oil prices raised
profit margins on products made from oil, the industry giants said
Monday.
   Ashland Oil Inc. said its net income was flat in its latest
fiscal quarter, but rose 55 percent excluding the effects of
unusual items.
   The drop in the price of oil lowered the companies' profits from
exploration and production of crude oil.
   However, the price drop raised their profits from products such
as gasoline, heating oil and petrochemicals by reducing the cost of
the oil that goes into making them, Exxon and Arco said.
   Sometimes prices of refined products fall in lockstep with crude
oil prices, but this time they stayed relatively firm, creating
wider profit margins for the oil companies.
   Oil prices have fallen over the past year, mainly because of the
inability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
rein in excess production.
   Arco said its average price for domestic crude oil fell more
than $4 a barrel, to $9.62 a barrel in the third quarter from $14 a
barrel a year earlier.
   New York-based Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, said it
earned $1.26 billion, or 93 cents a share, up from $1.07 billion,
or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 0.2 percent to
$21.89 billion from $21.93 billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Exxon said its
profit rose 18 percent to $3.88 billion, or $2.89 a share, from
$3.29 billion, or $2.31 a share. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to $65.5
billion from $61.5 billion.
   Improved profit margins on refined products were made possible
by relatively firm prices for the products, combined with lower
costs for the crude oil that goes into them, Exxon said. Margins on
refining and marketing had been ``severely depressed'' a year
earlier, the company said.
   However, weak crude oil prices depressed earnings from
exploration and production operations, it said.
   Arco, based in Los Angeles and the eighth largest U.S. oil
company, said its profit rose to $391 million, or $2.17 a share,
from $315 million, or $1.71 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
to $4.59 billion from $4.44 billion.
   For the nine-month period, Arco said its profit rose 34.8
percent to $1.19 billion, or $6.56 a share, from $884 million, or
$4.82 a share. Revenue rose about 11 percent to $13.8 billion from
$12.4 billion.
   Arco said its after-tax earnings from oil and gas exploration
and production shrank to $80 million from $235 million a year
earlier. But after-tax profits of refining and marketing rose to
$121 million from $30 million a year earlier.
   Profits at its Lyondell Petrochemical Co. jumped to $156 million
from $23 million. Arco announced separately that it was considering
selling 50 percent of Lyondell to the public in a stock offering.
   Ashland, the Ashland, Ky.-based company that is the nation's
14th largest oil company, said its profit in its fourth quarter
ended Sept. 30 was $66 million, or $1.19 a share, compared to $66
million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items,
net income rose 55 percent, the company said. Earnings for the full
fiscal year were $224 million, or $4.01 a share, on revenue of $8.2
billion, compared with earnings of $133 million, or $2.14 a share,
on revenue of $7 billion in 1987.
   But the company said in the release that unusual items affected
results for all periods, including the settlement of lawsuits by
former employees and cost overruns on fluidized bed boilers built
by a subsidiary. These and other previously announced items reduced
the fourth quarter's earnings by $25 million, or 45 cents a share,
and the year's results by $28 million, or 50 cents a share.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid disappointment over slack
export sales and improved growing conditions for South American
crops.
   Soybeans, corn and oats ended substantially lower but wheat
finished down only slightly due to a late rebound on news that
China was seeking 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   And the Agriculture Department's weekly report on grain
inspections for export, which was released after the close,
indicated greater movement of corn last week than expected,
analysts said.
   The USDA's report that 53.7 million bushels of corn were
inspected last week was ``really quite favorable,'' said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   ``It was surprisingly good in light of the light vessel count we
saw at Gulf,'' he said.
   Soybean prices retreated on reports of fairly heavy weekend
showers in Brazil and forecasts for more rain by midweek in both
Brazil and Argentina, Gustafson said.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 4\ cents lower with
December at $4.17{ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 4} cents lower

<HEAD>Union Files $35 Million Suit Against Morrell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the United Food & Commercial
Workers Union filed a $35 million lawsuit Monday in federal court
against John Morrell & Co. seeking unpaid wages and overtime over
the past three years.
   The court filing said Morrell, the nation's fifth-largest
meatpacker, failed to pay production workers for about 20 to 30
minutes of time spent each day putting on, taking off and cleaning
required safety equipment at its plants in Sioux City, Sioux Falls,
S.D., and Arkansas City, Kan. The suit could affect about 5,000
workers at Morrell plants, the union said.
   ``What they're basically doing is not paying you for every hour
you work,'' Ron Haase, chief steward of Local 1142 in Sioux City,
told a news conference.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Sioux City by 11
present and former workers at Morrell's Sioux City and Sioux Falls
plants, and incorporates claims by 185 other employees at Sioux
City and 352 others at Sioux Falls. Morrell is a subsidiary of the
Cincinnati-based United Brands.
   UFCW President William H. Wynn said in a news release from
Washington that the suit seeks $17.5 million in unpaid wages and
overtime, $17.5 million in ``liquidated damages'' and an injunction
barring Morrell from continuing willful violations of the federal
Fair Labor Standards Act.
   Morrell officials in Sioux City were in a meeting Monday and
could not be reached for comment. Officials at its parent compnay,
United Brands Co. in Cincinnati, did not return telephone calls.
   In the court filing, the workers said Morrell requires each
employee to clean safety equipment at the end of each shift and
some are required to clean equipment at meal breaks.
   Most of the workers who were not paid for cleaning the equipment
should have been compensated at the overtime pay rate of time and a
half, the union said.
   The court papers said Morrell ``continually required as a
condition of employment that its production workers handle and
clean required safety equipment.'' Such equipment includes steel
mesh aprons and gloves, arm guards and belly guards, the suit said.
   The union said the U.S. Labor Department sued IBP Inc. for
similar violations in 1986, and that IBP is contesting the claims
for back pay.
   Wynn pointed out that the filing came on the 50th anniversary of
the Fair Labor Standards Act.

<HEAD>Pan Am Flight Attendants File Age Discrimination Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flight attendants union at Pan Am Corp. has
filed a complaint with the federal government accusing the airline
of age discrimination in the recent closing of its San Francisco
base.
   The Independent Union of Flight Attendants, which represents
some 4,300 attendants at Pan Am, said it filed the discrimination
complaint on Oct. 13 with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
   Pan Am hadn't seen the complaint yet and had no immediate
comment on the action, spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said Monday. She
said it was the first such complaint filed against the airline in
recent years.
   The company's closing of the base on Oct. 1 was a ``purposeful
attempt'' to phase out older, higher paid and more experienced
flight attendants in favor of younger employees, Margaret Brennan,
president of the Pan Am local, said in a statement.
   ``Pan Am's trying to bring us back to the day of `no wrinkles in
the aisles,''' Ms. Brennan said. ``More than 100 of the 245 flight
attendants based in San Francisco were over the age of 40.''
   More than 90 percent of the 245 attendants were earning salaries
in Pan Am's higher wage scale, ranging up to $40,000 a year, the
union said. Current starting salaries for flight attendants at the
airline are about $10,000 to $12,000 annually.
   In its charge, the union is asking the EEOC for an
investigation, the reopening of the base, and damages to be paid to
flight attendants who retired early, were transferred or were laid
off as a result of the closure.
   As of mid-October, 19 attendants at the base had accepted early
retirement and 95 had been laid off, the union said. It said that
``many'' other attendants, now commuting from San Francisco to
other Pan Am bases, are expected to accept furlough or early
retirement.
   An age discrimination charge may be filed with the EEOC if the
party involved is over 40 years old and feels that he or she was
discriminated against because of age. The commission has agreed to
look into the flight attendants' charge, indicating that it
believes there may be merit in the accusation.

<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A. on Monday
announced an anticipated expansion of its car and truck plant in
Tennessee, saying it planned to add a third assembly line and use
it for passenger cars.
   The expansion was approved earlier this month by Nissan's board
of directors, but announcement was held until Monday. Nissan
already builds its Sentra cars and light trucks at the Smyrna,
Tenn., plant.
   However, the announcement didn't indicate the investment Nissan
would be making in the expansion, the kind of car to be made there
or production dates and capacities.
   It said a task force with members from the company's U.S. arm
and the parent company in Japan would study the project for three
months.
   ``We have been asking for the opportunity to expand our capacity
for some time,'' said Jerry Benefield, president and chief
executive officer of Nissan Motor Manufacturing. ``We are very
happy and proud that our board of directors and parent company have
given all of us at Nissan in Tennessee this vote of confidence.''
   It is the latest in a series of projects Nissan has announced
this year for the United States.
   In April, Nissan's board approved spending $31.1 million to
begin producing bumpers and assembling engines and truck axles at
the Tennessee plant, southeast of Nashville.
   Last month, Nissan and Ford Motor Co. announced a joint venture
to produce minivans at Ford's Avon Lake, Ohio, truck plant.
   And last week, Nissan Research and Development Inc. broke ground
for a $50 million research and design facility in Farmington Hills,
northwest of Detroit. Officials said among its projects would be
designing a new vehicle for the U.S. market.
   Nissan spokesman David Fox said Monday that initial plans call
for most of the new cars built at the Smyrna expansion plant to be
sold in the United States, but the company wasn't ruling out
shipping some cars overseas.
   Analyst Joseph Phillippi of the investment firm Shearson Lehman
Hutton in New York speculated that Nissan, like Honda, may be
positioning itself for penetration of the European market.
   ``I guess the intriguing thing is ... with respect to Europe in

   ``If you build a Honda here with 80 percent U.S. content, is it
a car from Japan or a car from the United States?'' he asked.
   European countries have entered into a variety of trade
agreements, quotas and voluntary restraints with Japan limiting the
number of Japanese cars coming to the continent.

   Trans World Airlines Inc. announced Monday that
Chairman Carl Icahn's plan to take the airline private has been
completed.
   TWA said the way for the privatization plan was cleared when a
Delaware court denied a request by some TWA shareholders for an
immediate injunction blocking the scheme.
   The Delaware Chancery Court rejected late Friday the injunction
requested last summer by several TWA shareholders, said Mark
Buckstein, the airline's general counsel. He said the request was
denied on the grounds that if the dissident shareholders aren't
satisfied with the amount they receive for selling their stock to
Icahn, they would be able to file for damages against him.
   The shareholders' suit seeking damages as a result of the
privatization plan is still pending in the Delaware court.
   Last week, the TWA pilots union withdrew its petition for an
injunction blocking Icahn's plan. The pilots retained their lawsuit
against the privatization proposal, however.
   The pilots' withdrawal of the petition, which came at a
preliminary hearing in New York State Supreme Court, was in return
for a guarantee that Icahn gave at the hearing. The financithan $1.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. announced it is
considering selling stock in its Lyondell Petrochemical Co.
subsidiary to the public while retaining a controlling interest in
the Texas firm.
   Arco's board of directors ordered a study of the plan Monday,
and hasn't decided definitely whether to make the public offering,
the company said.
   Lyondell produces petrochemicals in Channelview, Texas, and has
an oil refinery in Houston.
   If the stock offering proceeds, Arco would sell about 50 percent
of Lyondell and retain slightly less than half of the stock, the
company said.
   Money raised through the stock sale would be used for general
corporate purposes at Arco, including expansion of a stock
repurchase program.
   Arco also said it was considering having Lyondell take out $500
million in loans, and transferring that amount to Arco in a special
distribution if the stock offering proceeds.
   The announcement came as Arco, the eighth largest U.S. oil
compnay, reported a 24 percent increase in its profit for the third
quarter to $391 million, or $2.17 a share, from $315 million, or
$1.71 a share, a year earlier. It said the profit at Lyondell
jumped to $156 million from $23 million.

<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. will build a small manufacturing
plant near Spokane that should initially employ about 350 people to
make air conditioning ducting for the aerospace company's
jetliners, company officials said Monday.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton said the
manufacturing facility will manufacture fiberglass and Kevlar
ducting and will research automated production of jetliner floor
paneling. The facility could eventually produce floor panels for
all of Boeing's commercial jetliners.
   Construction is scheduled to begin next spring, with production
starting in spring 1990 at one of two undisclosed sites in the
Spokane area, Thornton said.
   The 230,000-square-foot, $20 million plant will produce ducting
used in air conditioning in Boeing jetliners. The finished ducts
will be shipped by truck to Boeing plants at Everett and Renton,
Thornton said.
   The manufacturing facility is the first step toward future
expansion, Thornton said. If development of the floor panel
manufacturing portion is successful, as many as 500 people could be
employed, he said.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes' fabrication plants make various
airplane components and are principally located in Auburn, although
the company also has such operations in Gresham, Ore.; Winnipeg,
Manitoba; Oak Ridge, Tenn.; and Macon, Ga.
   The company broke ground on a $235 million sheet-metal
manufacturing center in Auburn in July. That plant is intended to
replace Auburn's existing sheet-metal facility. In September, the
company also announced a $20 million expansion of its Gresham plant.
   Also in July, Boeing announced the signing of a three-year
contract with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Co. to supply sheet and
plate aluminum from its Trentwood rolling mill near Spokane.

   The stock market gave ground Monday, pulling
back from last week's 1988 highs in a session dominated by takeover
and buyout news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 50.32 points last
week, dropped 13.16 to 2,170.34.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
596 up, 866 down and 514 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 170.59 million
shares, down from 195.41 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 204.14 million shares.
   Takeover developments from late last week and the weekend sent
several prominent stocks higher.
   Kraft jumped 10 to 102. The company rejected a $90-a-share
takeover bid from Philip Morris, and proposed instead a
recapitalization plan it valued at at least $110 a share.
   RJR Nabisco climbed 7\ to 84. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said
it had organized a company to offer $90 a share for RJR, which said
last week it was considering a management buyout.
   West Point Pepperell rose 4} to 50. William Farley, chairman of
Fruit Of The Loom Inc., began a $48-a-share bid for the company.
   Chicago Pacific gained 13\ to 56|, and Maytag fell 2} to 23},
after Maytag announced plans to acquire Chicago Pacific.
   Takeover rumors and speculation spurred buying in such other
stocks as Mead Corp., up 2{ at 48\, and MCA, up 2] at 49].
   Given the frantic deal-making pace, analysts said, other stocks
tended to suffer from neglect.
   The takeover wave has helped carry stock prices lately to new
highs since the crash last fall. But some observers worry that it
might eventually lead to trouble for the market, by heaping huge
new amounts of debt on an already-extended economy.
   Energy stocks were weak as the price of oil tumbled $1.20 a
barrel to $13.17 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Amoco dropped
1{ to 74]; Chevron | to 46]; Mobil | to 45|, and Atlantic Richfield
1~ to 80~.
   Airline issues, meanwhile, moved up on prospects for lower fuel
prices. UAL rose 1[ to 98\; NWA 1\ to 53\; Delta Air Lines } to
51[, and AMR { to 50{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $10.13 billion, or 0.36
percent, in value from its Friday close.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .57 to 158.85.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.36 to 325.48, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.38 at 282.28.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 1.36 to 387.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 304.95, down 1.12.

<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. on Monday reported its
third-quarter profits nearly tripled amid sales increases in each
of the company's operating units.
   Net income during the quarter ended Sept. 30 totaled $213
million, or $1.49 a share on a fully diluted basis, up from $74
million, or 55 cents a share in the year-ago period.
   Consolidated sales for the third quarter jumped 22 percent to
$2.11 billion, compared with $1.73 billion a year ago.
   Chairman Robert D. Kennedy said the strong performance reflects
the upswing for chemicals generally and Carbide's strong position
in the markets that it serves.
   George Krug, senior chemical analyst with Eberstadt Fleming in
New York, said he was not surprised at Carbide's performance.
   ``Profits for all commodity chemical producers have gone through
the roof,'' Krug said.
   He said chemical companies are raising prices ``dramatically''
while costs are down. But Krug predicted that next year earnings
will be lower because prices will ``ease off.''
   For the first nine months of 1988, Carbide said net income
jumped 140 percent to $501 million, or $3.55 a share on a fully
diluted basis, compared with $209 million, or $1.57 a share in the
first nine months of 1987.
   Consolidated sales for the nine-month period were $6.19 billion,
up 22 percent from $5.07 billion a year ago.

   The dollar rose Monday, partly in reaction to a
Treasury Department report that said strength in the dollar this
year would not slow down reduction of the huge U.S. trade deficit.
   Gold prices fell $3 an ounce or more following an inconclusive
weekend meeting of eight oil producers. Republic National Bank of
New York said gold bullion was bid at $405.50 a troy ounce as of 4
p.m. EDT, down from $408.50 an ounce late Friday.
   In a report required by Congress, the Treasury Department said
it did not expect the dollar's rise from its lows of January to
``significantly alter'' prospects for continued progress on
shrinking the trade gap.
   Some currency traders saw the report as a sign that the Reagan
administration was not in favor of a continued fall in the dollar.
   ``It's the first salvo just to give notice to the market that it
is not a one-way street,'' said Charles E. Minnaar, a vice
president at Chase Manhattan Bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar edged up 0.20 yen to a closing 126.60. Later, in
London, it was quoted at the same rate. In New York, the dollar
rose to 127.02 yen from 126.28 yen late Friday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.7520, cheaper than $1.7620 late Friday. In New York,
the pound fell to $1.7501 from $1.7615 Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7898 West German marks, up from 1.7778; 1.5175
Swiss francs, up from 1.5061; 1.1986 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1992; 6.1100 French francs, up from 6.0900; and 1,332.88 Italian
lire, up from 1,327.50.
   The New York rates are based on quotes before the Treasury
Department report was issued to Congress at 4 p.m. EDT. An hour
after that, the dollar was at 1.7930 West German marks, 126.97 yen
and 1.7485 British pounds.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7860 West German marks, down from 1.7875; 1.5145
Swiss francs, up from 1.5135; 6.1025 French francs, down from
6.1115; 2.0143 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0170; 1,330.85 Italian
lire, down from 1,332.50; and 1.1973 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2022.
   Bullion dealers said the slide in gold prices followed the
failure of eight member nations of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to reach any firm agreement on restraining
production during a meeting in Spain.
   They said a tip toward the bearish side on the technical charts
added to the downward pressure on gold.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $408.20 a troy ounce bid, down from
$411.10 an ounce on Saturday. In London, gold fell to $405.15 an
ounce from $410.15 late Friday. In Zurich, it fell to $405.50 an
ounce from $409.40 late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $405.80 a troy ounce from $408.40 an ounce Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London on Monday at a late bid of $6.23 a
troy ounce, down from Friday's $6.28. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $6.197 a troy ounce from
$6.223 Friday.

<HEAD>Restructuring Charge Lowers SmithKline Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beckman Corp. on Monday reported
it lost $195.5 million in the third quarter because of a one-time
charge associated with a major restructuring.
   The Philadelphia-based pharmaceutical giant, which has been
reeling from a plunge in sales of its two leading drugs, said it
would have made $97.1 million, or 79 cents per share, without the
$389.3 million charge.
   In the year-ago period, SmithKline reported profits of $149.6
million, or $1.18 a share.
   Sales during the quarter totaled $1.17 billion, up from $1.10
billion during the same 1987 period.
   The one-time charge against pretax earnings was announced Sept.
27 as payment for a corporate restructuring, which will combine
pharmaceutical units worldwide into Smith Kline & French
Laboratories, consolidate manufacturing capacity and eliminate
1,600 jobs.
   The charge includes the costs of closing facilities, severance
expenses, pension enhancements, write-downs of certain assets and
reserves for estimated liabilities.
   In a statement, Henry Wendt, chairman and chief executive
officer, said sales of the drug Tagamet dropped 18 percent
worldwide, with U.S. sales down 40 percent and international sales
up 9 percent. U.S. sales of Dyazide, the company's other leading
drug, also decreased, he said.
   ``Wholesalers and retailers of Tagamet and Dyazide continued to
work down the large inventory of product they had on hand,'' Wendt
said. ``We hope to return to more normal buying patterns in the
fourth quarter.''
   Profits for the first nine months of 1988 fell 84 percent to
$69.8 million, or 56 cents a share, from $428.1 million or $3.36 a
share in 1987. Sales rose to $3.47 billion from $3.13 billion.

<HEAD>Copper Prices Dive On Profit-Taking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices took their sharpest dive in nearly four
months Monday on New York's Commodity Exchange as traders took
profits after bidding up prices to an all-time high last week.
   On other markets, precious metals futures declined as energy
prices tumbled; pork bellies rallied strongly; livestock futures
were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   The Comex spot copper price plunged 3.85 cents to $1.414 a pound
while the contract for delivery in December fell 3 cents to
$1.3325, the steepest drop in the copper market since July 1.
   Analysts said copper prices were due for a correction after
climbing by 60 percent since early August to a record $1.465 a
pound during Friday's trading. The spot price settled Friday below
the record level reached during the day.
   Monday's stronger dollar and weaker oil prices provided a
bearish backdrop for the entire metals complex.
   But the strongest sell signal for copper traders appeared to be
the London Metal Exchange's report of a 7,900-metric-ton decline
last week in its warehouse stocks of the metal. The market had been
expecting a steeper drop in LME stocks, said Fred Demler, metals
economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York, said LME stocks
of copper have fallen as low as they were late last December, when
spot copper soared to $1.46 a pound.
   Although the spot copper price surpassed that level last week,
Steel noted the December contract had risen only as high as $1.382
compared with $1.41 last year.
   ``We're still a few cents under last year's high and that was
something of a signal for profit-taking,'' he said. ``But it's only
natural to be pullling back and taking some profits after the highs
of last week.''
   Steel said he expected copper prices to fall further, perhaps as
low as $1.30 for December delivery, before rising again.
   Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said the December copper price could fall as low as $1.12 and still
not break the market's bullish momentum.
   Precious metals futures prices fell moderately on the Comex in
reaction to the sharp drop in oil prices, analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.60 to $3.10 lower with December at $408.80 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.6 cents to 3 cents lower with December at
$6.255 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures plummeted on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
reaction to the failure of eight OPEC oil ministers to reach an
agreement to curb crude-oil production at a meeting that ended
during the weekend.
   ``I think this is an example of unrealistic expectations in a
market ripe for disappointment,'' said Peter Beutel, an energy
analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 94 cents to $1.20
lower with December at $13.17 a barrel; heating oil was 1.84 cents
to 2.81 cents lower with November at 39.90 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.26 cents to 2 cents lower with November at 49.96
cents a gallon.
   Frozen pork belly futures prices soared in a technical rally
inspired by the market's refusal to fall sharply in reaction to
Friday's weekly cold-storage report from the Agriculture Department.
   The USDA reported about 1 million more pounds of pork bellies in
cold storage than the market had expected.
   Hog prices advanced with the bellies while cattle futures rose
in reaction to cash cattle prices as high as $74 per hundredweight,
the highest packer price paid since spring, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .47 cent higher with December
at 74.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .47 cent
higher with October at 81.95 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent to
.55 cent higher with December at 42.25 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.60 cents to 1.75 cents higher with February at 51.25
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago
Board ofTrade amid disappointment over slack export sales and
improved growing conditions for South American soybeans.
   Soybeans, corn and oats ended substantially lower but wheat
settled mixed due to a late rebound on news that China was seeking
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Wheat settled 3\ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with December at
$4.18} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 6 cents lower with December at
$2.77{ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5{ cents lower with December
at $2.44} a bushel; soybeans were 10\ cents lower to 1 cent higher
with November at $7.65{ a bushel.
   Stock-index futures closed modestly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of
the Standard & Poor's 500 settled 1.35 points lower at 283.65.

   New regulations for drinking water and waste
treatment could cost homeowners an average of $100 or more in
additional municipal fees by 1996, a study by the Environmental
Protection Agency estimates.
   An in-house agency committee also said farms and some small
businesses could face significant costs from 85 major regulations
promulgated in the past year or two or expected in the next few
years.
   The cost estimates for the regulations affecting municipalities
dealt only with new standards for drinking water, waste water
treatment and solid waste. Costs for other regulations, such as
asbestos controls in schools, could not be derived, so the
committee said it considered its estimates floors that could be
exceeded.
   Based on an analysis of the finances of 207 municipalities, the
committee estimated that 21 percent to 30 percent of the smallest _
places with fewer than 2,500 people _ could have trouble raising
loans or floating bond issues for the capital expenditures the
regulations will require. Only 3 percent to 7 percent of towns
larger than that are expected to have difficulty raising money.
   The panel said the states and federal officials may have to
devise new ways of helping the smaller communities. In some cases,
it said, smaller towns may need to merge their services.
   The panel said the increase in fees, taxes and other charges for
the three environmental services would be highest in the least and
most populous cities _ $170 in the smallest towns and $160 in
cities of more than 250,000.
   In 20 percent of the smallest places, current charges could more
than double, but nationwide only 2 percent of the households would
see an increase that large.
   Data for farms as a whole proved harder to come by, so the
committee examined some speciality crops as well as farms of three
common types _ an Illinois corn and soybean operation, of which
there are about 31,000; a Mississippi farm growing cotton and
soybeans, of which there are about 1,800; and a Kansas farm
producing wheat and cattle, of which there are about 20,000.
   Assuming that the agency tried to promulgate regulations with
minimum costs and that not every farmer in average financial
condition had to meet every requirement, income before depreciation
would fall by 3 percent for the Mississippi and Kansas farms and by
0.7 percent for the Illinois farm.
   In the worst case of high-cost regulations that all farmers
would have to meet, the Illinois farm would lose 26 percent of its
income, the Mississippi farm would lose 24 percent and the Kansas
farm would lose 84 percent.
   Only moderate changes in profits would be expected by producers
of the specialty crops examined, with the important exception of
New York and Michigan apple growers.
   In the worst case of high-cost fungicide regulations, even
``average impacts'' would mean New York growers could see a drop of
60 percent in their current $220 net return per acre, and Michigan
growers could lose 84 percent of their $80 per acre. Washington
returns would barely change from $330, increasing by 0.2 percent
because apple prices would rise.
   Seventy percent of the nation's 3.5 million small businesses _
those with fewer than 50 employees _ are in non-polluting fields
such as wholesale and retail trade, finance or other services.
   The committee said it was able to identify several industries
where costs to comply with future regulations had a good chance of
eating up either 30 percent of annual profits or requiring capital
expenditures of more than 30 percent of the owners' investment.
   Most prominent are dry cleaners, who may be faced with expensive
controls on solvents, and service stations faced with cleaning up
any leaking underground tanks.
   If controls on perchloroethylene, the most common solvent, are
required for dry cleaners with nine or fewer employees, those
companies could be faced with new annual costs equaling 35 percent
of median net profits and capital expenditures of 33 percent of
median owners' investment.
   Similar figures were not presented for service stations.
However, the committee said ``only the strongest'' would be able to
survive if required expenditures were concentrated in a two-year or
three-year period, but most could survive if given a longer time.
   Among other industries examined, small electroplaters, wood
preservers and pesticide formulators could have difficulty meeting
toxic chemical regulations. If they have leaking underground tanks,
farm supply stores and trucking companies also could be vulnerable.
Small photofinishers were concluded to have no problems since they
recycle silver compounds and generally do not use other hazardous
material.

<TEXT>
   Two stars of the computer industry reported diverging
third-quarter results Monday, as Compaq Computer Corp. recorded a
59 percent profit gain and Cray Research Inc. posted a 37 percent
decline.
   Compaq said its profit gain came on a 60 percent increase in
sales as the Houston-based personal computer maker continued to
benefit from strong demand for its powerful personal computers.
   Cray, the world's leading manufacturer of supercomputers, said
its profit drop came on a 21 percent decline in sales. It predicted
a bulge in sales in the fourth quarter, resulting in a roughly 10
percent revenue gain for the full year, but said the profit gain
for the year would be limited to 5 percent to 7 percent because of
unexpectedly high costs of research and development.
   Compaq said it earned $58 million, or $1.40 a share on a fully
diluted basis, up from $36 million, or 94 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $501.6 million from $313.5 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Compaq said its
earnings rose 87 percent to $163 million, or $4.06 a share on a
fully diluted basis, from $87 million, or $2.29 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 76.4 percent to $1.40 billion from $792
million.
   The earnings per share are calculated on the basis of what they
would be assuming they are diluted by an increase in the number of
outstanding shares through conversion of all convertible securities
into common stock.
   Compaq is the leader in sales of personal computers based on
Intel Corp.'s 80386, the chip maker's fastest microprocessor.
   Cray Research, of Minneapolis, said its profit in the quarter
fell to $22.6 million, or 73 cents a share, down from $36.1
million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $145.2
million from $184.6 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Cray said its
profit fell 40 percent to $68.1 million, or $2.19 a share, from
$113.0 million, or $3.57 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 19
percent to $425.4 million from $523.7 million.

<TEXT>
   Management at Fort Howard Corp., with
help from a New York investment firm, on Monday completed a $3.55
billion buyout that returns the paper manufacturer to private
ownership.
   The buyout, first proposed in June by Morgan Stanley Group Inc,
was led by Fort Howard's chief executive and chairman Paul J.
Schierl, president Donald H. De Meuse and Kathleen J. Hempel,
executive vice president.
   About 150 people, most shareholders, attended a meeting at the
company's headquarters to observe the completion of the buyout.
   The meeting was a formality since those controlling nearly 80
percent of Fort Howard's stock accepted the $53-per-share offer.
Only a simple majority of the approximately 68 million shares was
required to complete the deal.
   Shareholders who have not tendered stock have been advised to do
so shortly to guarantee they will receive payment.
   The company was organized privately in 1919 by Austin Cofrin and
went public in 1971.

<HEAD>Kroger to Pay Cash Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kroger Co. said Monday it plans to pay
later this week the $40 per common share cash dividend that it
promised shareholders as part of a restructuring to fight off
takeover bids.
   The nation's largest supermarket operator said the cash payments
will be made Friday and soon be followed by distribution of
promised debentures, also part of the restructuring plan.
   Kroger offered the up-front payments to entice shareholders to
support its plan to reorganize itself into a smaller, but still
independent food retailer.
   Kroger has pressed ahead with the $4.6 billion restructuring
plan it proposed in September, despite two outside offers to buy
the company. Kroger rebuffed both offers.
   The company promised to pay shareholders $40 in cash per common
share, plus $17 in principal on a junior subordinated discount
debenture intended to have an $8 trading value.
   At least four shareholder suits have been filed against Kroger
to challenge its conclusion that the restructuring is a better
financial alternative than buyout offers from ther investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. of New York, or from the Dart Group
Inc. of Landover, Md.
   Kohlberg Kravis made a $5.03 billion, or $64-per-share, bid that
Kroger officials said could run into antitrust objections because
the investment firm has other supermarket holdings. Kohlberg Kravis
withdrew the bid after it was rejected by Kroger.
   Dart, which began the Kroger takeover bidding Sept. 19, offered
$4.32 billion, or $55 per share. Dart offered to help Kroger fight
the Kohlberg Kravis bid, but has refused to say whether its own
offer had been withdrawn.
   Kroger said it would have to sell some company assets, including
stores, food processing plants and corporate real estate, to offset
costs of restructuring.
   The company also fired about 300 of its 800 Cincinnati corporate
headquarters employees, giving them extended pay, health care and
relocation allowances in termination payments on a one-day notice.
The firings did not include personnel in its supermarkets.
   The 105-year-old company has approximately 170,000 employees and
52,000 shareholders. Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets,
900 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states.

<TEXT>
   Kraft Inc. said Monday it would give advance
notice if it decided to proceed with any part of its $13.6 billion
defensive restructuring without the approval of its directors and
shareholders.
   Kraft's statement in federal court in Chicago was a victory for
the company pursuing Kraft, Philip Morris Cos. Inc., which had
sought a temporary restraining order asking for three days' notice
of any restructuring moves.
   Kraft is seeking to boost its debt more than tenfold in order to
make a huge payout to its shareholders that would convince them not
to go along with a takeover offer of more than $11 billion from
Philip Morris.
   U.S. District Judge James B. Moran rejected Philip Morris's
request for a temporary restraining order, saying it was unneeded
because of Kraft's agreement to give advance notice to the court.
   Philip Morris Chairman and Chief Executive Hamish Maxwell
criticized the restructuring as lacking in details and being
dependent upon the break-up of Kraft.
   The restructuring plan ``will require ... burdening what is left
(of Kraft) with an enormous debt, mortgaging its future,'' Maxwell
said.
   A spokesperson for Kraft said later Monday that ``disparaging''
remarks made by Philip Morris regarding the recapitalization plan
are ``totally consistent with Philip Morris's pressure tactics to
buy Kraft on the cheap.''
   Some experts agreed with Philip Morris's criticism of the Kraft
moves, arguing that Kraft's plan fails the litmus test for a
successful restructuring: The company is not mismanaged and its
assets are not undervalued, thereby limiting management's ability
to squeeze out the extra dollars needed to pay down billions in
fresh debt.
   ``They can't service debt'' at that level, said Ronald Morrow,
an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., referring to
interest and principal payments that will have to be made on what
Kraft estimates will add up to more than $12.4 billion in debt.
   ``They can't earn enough from their businesses to cover the
leverage,'' he said Monday, adding in jest that Kraft ``is going to
have to sell off all the assets.''
   On Sunday, Kraft management rejected as inadequate Philip
Morris's $90-a-share cash offer and unveiled its own restructuring
plan valued at $110 a share.
   Glenview, Ill.-based Kraft, maker of Velveeta cheese and
Sealtest ice creams, said some non-core businesses would be sold to
raise cash. But the plan also hinges on bank borrowings and the
issuance of junk bonds in order to pay shareholders $84 a share in
cash. Shareholders also would receive securities and retain an
interest in their common shares.
   In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kraft soared
$10 a share to close at $102.
   ``Under these circumstances, it's either buy (the company) or
get had,'' said Stephen Carnes, a managing director at
Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray & Hopwood.
   But observers also conceded the restructuring might just be a
strategy designed to goad Philip Morris into sweetening its offer.
Indeed, Kraft said in a statement that it ``advised Philip Morris
that we were not foreclosing negotiations and that if they were to
offer a price that reflects the full value of Kraft, we would
negotiate.''
   If that strategy proves successful, ``it would be a plus for
(Kraft) management,'' said Edward Froelich, an analyst at Pershing
& Co. If not, it ``won't be the first time a company has gone to
the cleaners to stay in business'' under current management, he
said.
   A restructuring, if implemented, would take its toll on the
company for several years to come. ``It's going to take all the
earnings out of the company (and put) them all in dividends,''
Carnes said. ``It doesn't make a lot of business sense.''
   Kraft has been undergoing a transformation for several years in
an effort to shed its non-food operations. In 1986 the company
formed Premark International Inc. to spin off its consumer products
operations. With the $1.8 billion sale of its Duracell batteries
unit this summer to a management group led by the buyout powerhouse
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Kraft finally returned to its roots
as a food and food services concern.
   ``They've really only just become a food company in the last two
quarters,'' said Carnes. The restructuring currently on the table
``is the last thing you'd do'' in a normal business environment, he
added.
   Kraft admitted as much in announcing the restructuring. The
company called the plan a product ``of current era investment
policies and financial attitues that favor short-term financial
gratification over steady, long-term growth and the need to provide
a sound economy for future generations.''
   Analysts were concerned over which businesses Kraft might
consider selling. Carnes speculated the company's food ingredients
business might be on the block. Kraft sells oils, seasonings,
cheese products and other ingredients to food processors and
foodservice customers.
   Worse, however, Kraft might opt to sell its frozen foods
operations as a package, partly because the majority of products in
this category do not carry the Kraft name and therefore could be
easily separated from the company. Some of the products include
Lender's bagels, Tombstone pizzas and the Budget Gourmet.
   ``The whole industry is going into frozen foods,'' said Carnes,
lamenting that it would be a ``real crime'' if Kraft were forced to
sell ``one of the trendy businesses.''

<TEXT>
   Spin magazine announced Monday that each copy of
its November edition will contain a free condom, but said many
distributors and retailers were refusing to accept the magazines.
   Citing the threat of AIDS, Spin editor and publisher Bob
Guccione Jr. said, ``We are making a statement to our young adult
readership. ... It is an immensely important and responsible
statement: that safe sex can save lives.''
   The November issue, which is to arrive on newsstands later this
week, will feature a public service announcement that includes
condoms provided by Carter-Wallace Inc., makers of Trojan condoms,
and instructions on how to use them. The magazine has a monthly
circulation of 140,000.
   Spin, which covers popular music in particular and pop culture
in general, released a list of more than 20 distributors who
refused to handle the magazine because of the condoms.
   ``It is something that will make our magazine very
controversial,'' said Jonathan Marder, a Spin spokesman. ``This
list (of distributors) is expanding rapidly.'' Many, he said, were
drug stores which themselves sell condoms.
   In a letter explaining the move, Guccione said: ``Our inclusion
of the condom is an emphatic message to readers to at least
consider how serious the implications of sexually transmitted
diseases are, and how much sense condoms make. We are not
moralizing, but once again informing.''
   He quoted Surgeon General Everett Koop as calling condoms ``the
best preventive measure against AIDS, besides not having sex and
practicing safe behavior.''

   ITT Corp., one of the biggest U.S. companies,
pleaded guilty Monday to fraud for treating Air Force aides to
liquor, food, golf and entertainment to get secrets used to bid on
$180 million in military contracts.
   The New York-based conglomerate faces a maximum $500,000 fine in
U.S. District Court on the charge of conspiring to defraud the
government.
   ITT admitted an employee of its defense technology division in
1984 and early 1985 spent about $15,000 and was reimbursed for
illegal gifts to Air Force officials at Hanscom Air Force Base in
Bedford, Mass.
   In exchange, ITT received copies of internal government
documents with confidential procurement information on two Air
Force programs ITT was interested in pursuing.
   ITT was indicted in June 1987, several months before a separate
federal investigation into the use of consultants by corporations
to get information for use in bidding for Pentagon contracts.
   ``This office will continue to ferret out and prosecute
vigorously fraud and corruption in the defense industry,'' U.S.
Attorney Frank L. McNamara said in a statement.
   Edward M. Vicenzi, a senior marketing representative of ITT's
Van Nuys, Calif.-based Gilfillan subsidiary, which specializes in
radar technology, pleaded guilty in July to the same charge. He
faces up to 35 years in prison and a $500,000 fine on the charges.
   ITT officials said the case involved one employee and was not
tied to the Pentagon procurement scandal.
   ``We pleaded guilty to the fact that the person involved was our
employee when he acted improperly,'' ITT Chairman Rand V. Araskog
said in a statement. ``We had no choice because that employee
pleaded guilty.''
   ``It's in no way from our standpoint to be compared to that
Pentagon inquiry,'' ITT spokesman James Gallagher said. ``We are
not using consultants to gain competitor information, which is the
focus of the Pentagon inquiry.''
   ITT was one of the first defense contractors to implement the
1986 Defense Industry Initiative, a set of guidelines recommended
by a presidential panel on reforming how the Pentagon buys weapons.
   According to the indictment, Vicenzi was hired in August 1983 to
pursue two Air Force contracts _ an anti-radiation missile decoy
system valued at more than $80 million and a mobile air traffic
control radar system worth between $100 million and $150 million.
   Vicenzi's $60,000-a-year job was to get inside government
information on the programs, including Air Force plans,
specifications, procurement strategy and projected costs, the
indictment said.
   He reportedly had close ties with procurement officials at the
Air Force's Electronics Systems Division at Hanscom, responsible
for buying all Air Force electronics systems.
   Four government employees who received gratuities from Vincenzi
gave him copies of documents with information on the contracts as
well as general planning and funding documents, including the
entire minutes of an Air Force meeting for the missile decoy
system, the indictment said.
   He sent the documents to other ITT Gilfillan employees,
including senior business development officials, engineers and
program managers, writing ``This is extremely sensitive'' or ``Do
not acknowledge our possession of this document.''
   ITT Gilfillan won a preliminary $6.4 million development
contract for the $80 million missile decoy system, which would have
protected U.S. radar sites by luring homing missiles away, the
indictment said. Neither that system nor the radar control system,
known as MPN-XX, was built.
   Federal prosecutors told the U.S. District Judge David S. Nelson
that several ITT employees tried to cover-up Vicenzi's activities
by destroying or concealing the documents after word was out of an
investigation. ITT said Vicenzi was fired in 1986 in an unrelated
matter.
   Vicenzi allegedly had repeated contact with Maurice Raciti, a
deputy program manager in logistics at Hanscom who resigned from
the Air Force in late 1986 after Air Force oficials suspended him
pending the outcome of the federal investigation. He has not been
charged.
   The indictment said Vicenzi on numerous occasions met with
Raciti and ``bought him lunches, paid for him to play golf,
provided him with tickets to sporting and theater events and gave
him gifts of liquor.''
   The Defense Department suspended business with ITT Gillifan from
July to November 1987 because of the Justice Department
investigation.

<TEXT>
   Farmers Group Inc. said Monday that its
profit rose 6 percent in the third quarter, although it spent $8.2
million in an unsuccessful fight against a buyout by Batus Inc.
   Farmers said Monday it earned $65.9 million, or 96 cents a
share, up from $62.1 million, or 90 cents a share, in the third
quarter of 1987. Revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $302.1
million, up from $287.6 million a year earlier.
   After an acrimonious eight-month battle, Farmers agreed in
August to be bought by Batus, a Louisville, Ky.-based tobacco,
retailing and paper conglomerate, for $5.2 billion cash. The merger
awaits approval by regulators in three states, Ohio, Oregon and
Kansas.
   Farmers said Monday it spent $8.2 million in the third quarter
fighting the takeover, and a total of $15.8 million over the course
of the year.
   Farmers, the nation's third-biggest home and auto insurer and
seventh-largest property and casualty insurer, attributed its
higher revenue to higher premiums, more policies sold, cost control
and a lower tax rate.
   In the first nine months of 1988, Farmers reported a profit of
$205.9 million, or $3 a share, up 13 percent from the profit of
$181.5 million, or $2.62 a share, in the same period of 1987.
Revenue for the first three quarters was $888.7 million, up from
$830.6 million a year earlier.

   United Technologies Corp. and the
merchant banking firm Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen announced
Monday they had agreed to jointly acquire Sheller-Globe Corp. from
Knoll International Holdings Inc. in a leveraged buyout.
   Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed, although
UTC and Gibbons, Green said their combined equity investment was
less than $100 million.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds, rather than equity, that are repaid with money
raised by the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.
   Sheller-Globe, with annual sales of more than $800 million, has
been an industry leader in the design, engineering and manufacture
of high-quality automotive components, parts and assemblies.
   The company's products are sold primarily to the
original-equipment automotive and light truck markets in the United
States and Europe. Interior automotive parts are its primary area
and it is the world's largest independent producer of steering
wheels.
   UTC and Gibbons, Green said they intend to create a new entity
to acquire Detroit-based Sheller-Globe and operate it as an
independent firm with the present management.
   UTC, based in Hartford, and New York-based Gibbons, Green said
they will operate the company with Sheller-Globe management through
an independent board of directors, although the management of
United Technologies Automotive, based in Dearborn, Mich., will work
closely with Sheller-Globe.
   ``The planned investment in Sheller-Globe will leverage UTC's
unique capabilities in the automotive industry as well as enhance
Sheller-Globe's competitiveness in its respective product areas,''
stated UTC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert F. Daniell.
