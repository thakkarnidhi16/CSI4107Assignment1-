   Two explosions ripped through a riverside
grain elevator complex Friday, killing at least two people,
injuring three others and leveling four grain silos and an office
building, authorities said.
   Three more people were reported missing at the ADM Growmark
complex, along the Des Plaines River about 40 miles southwest of
Chicago, said Lynn Behringer, a spokeswoman for the Will County
Emergency Services and Disaster Agency.
   Officials on the scene confirmed that two people died and at
least three others were injured, Ms. Behringer added.
   ``It shook this building like a truck or something had hit the
back of this building,'' said John Vanderlinden, a worker at nearby
Stonitsch Construction Co. ``It was quite a big explosion.''
   Authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first
explosion about 11 a.m., which ruptured a natural gas main and
touched off a second blast moments later, said Fire Chief George
Plese. Granaries pose an explosion risk because of highly flammable
grain dust.
   The explosions leveled the complex's 100-feet tall concrete
silos, which hold a total of about 100,000 bushels, said Dick
Burket, a spokesman for the granary.
   Initial reports said six silos were destroyed, but David
Munchalfen, a security guard at the facility, said there had been
four silos at the site, and only a sheet-metal covered grain dryer
remained standing. One silo crushed the adjacent one-story office
building.
   ``It's gone, totaled, level complete _ just like dynamite,''
said Bob Butterfield, 64, a Wilmington farmer who said he saw metal
and concrete flying through the air after the blast.
   ``I ran about 30 feet when I fell and rolled. It just came down
in a big pile,'' said Butterfield, who witnessed the blast while he
was leaving the complex after unloading a truckload of grain.
   Rescue workers used dogs, bulldozers and a crane to search for
two people believed missing in a 25-foot-high pile of concrete
chunks and twisted steel mixed with corn and soybeans, authorities
said.
   Disaster officials also sent four boats to search the river
after a witness reported seeing a third person fall off a barge
nearby, Ms. Behringer said.
   The explosion shattered windows in homes east of the elevator
complex and sprayed grain and rubble, burying a tractor-trailer rig.
   The ADM Growmark elevator is a joint venture between
Decatur-based Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Bloomington-based
Growmark, a regional cooperative that sells farm supplies and
markets grain.
   ADM spokesman Dick Burket in Decatur said the complex receives
grain hauled by truck and transfers it to river barges.
   The Illinois accident brought to five the number of people
killed in elevator explosions so far this year in the United
States, said Juan Gomez of the U.S. Agriculture Department.
   Department statistics show 222 workers were killed and 839 were
injured in 489 grain-dust explosions from 1958 through 1985. Data
for the last two years was not immediately available.
   Authorities identified the dead as Dale Brent Slatton, 28, of
Newark, Ill. and Mark D. Stewart, 20, of Anchor. Both worked at the
elevator, Stewart part-time while he studied agriculture at Joliet
Junior College.
   One person was in fair condition at St. Joseph Medical Center
and another was treated and released, said spokeswoman Phyllis
Oudt. A third person was treated at Silver Cross Hospital and
released, said spokeswoman Julie Grant.

   There once was a time when people could sit
in the bar of the old Hotel Del Prado and enjoy looking at Diego
Rivera's mural, ``Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park.''
   The once elegant hotel is now an earthquake-damaged hulk waiting
to be demolished, and the mural is in its own museum pavilion
across the street.
   The delicate transfer of the mural has been completed. It
escaped damage in the Sept. 19, 1985, earthquake that killed
thousands and devastated large parts of the city.
   The famous mural is open to the public again, like a window
opened on Mexico's rich history. It shows figures from the Mexican
political and art worlds and from daily life all on parade in the
park.
   An explanation at the entrance to the new museum says the
decision was made to transfer the mural from the hotel after the
extent of the damage there became clear.
   ``It should be linked to the Alameda, for having been painted on
that theme and for the place itself,'' the plaque from the National
Fine Arts Institute says.
   The Alameda, the downtown park across the street and down a
block from the mural's old home, also was expanded through
earthquake reconstruction programs. A ``Solidarity Garden''
recalling the victims of the 1985 disaster was built on the site of
the cleared, adjoining block that once held a department store and
the Hotel Regis.
   The mural's pavilion is built on the site of the hotel's parking
garage, which was badly damaged and demolished after the quake.
   The Fine Arts Institute said that no room could be found in any
of its buildings close to the Alameda, ``because of the colossal
dimensions of the work. ... That's why it was decided to take
advantage of the possibility of constructing an appropriate
building.''
   In place of the old hotel's comfortable cocktail lounge, viewers
now can sit on three simple benches placed in front of the mural or
just stand for a while in the large but sparsely decorated room.
Diagrams, with keyed numbers on the outline of each figure, tell
who 73 of the people shown in the mural are.
   Among the figures is a fat boy with large eyes and a round face,
a self-portrait _ something Rivera often put in his works.
   In the foreground is Spanish conqueror Hernando Cortes. On a
park bench an elderly man dreams of President Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna, giving American Gen. William Scott the keys to Texas,
New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada and other lands that once
belonged to Mexico.
   Farther back, a former military man, now poor, dreams of the
emperors Maximilian and Carlota. A drunken tramp, next to an old
woman, dreams with his mouth open of miltiary glories, at the side
of Benito Juarez, who holds the reform laws he put into effect as
Mexico's great 19th century president.
   Near the center is dictator Porfirio Diaz and his wife, Carmen
Romero Rubio. Diaz appears full of his fame and power, with a chest
full of ribbons on his uniform.
   At the right, a street vendor offers typical Mexican food to a
middle-class youth and three students, who dream of Gen. Victoriano
Huerta. Official history says Huerta had Francisco I. Madero, who
started the 1910-21 Mexican revolution, killed.
   Rivera completed the 49{ foot by 13 foot painting for the then
fashionable Del Prado in 1948.
   Along with David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jose Clemente Orozco,
Rivera was one of Mexico's three great muralists and one of the
most important Latin American painters in the art world. He died in
1957.
   Among his other best known murals are those in the National
Palace of the Spanish conquest, the Mexican revolution and other
events from the country's history.
   ``The composition is memories of my life, of my childhood and my
youth, from 1895 to 1910,'' Rivera wrote after finishing the mural.
``I do not believe that this work has alarmed or can alarm anyone.
The contemporary figures in the fresco, as figures in dreams, are
not portraits.''
   It was an apparent reference to the phrase, ``God Does Not
Exist,'' a quote attributed to Juarez adviser Ignacio Ramirez and
written on a piece of paper by Ramirez in the mural.
   Eight years after the mural was completed, Rivera changed the
paper to read, ``Conference in the Academy of Letran, the year
1836.'' The phrase refers to the date and place where Ramirez made
his controversial comment.

   Massachusetts' first step towards universal health
care insurance may be a first step towards a national health care
plan, says Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   ``What we do here today can and must be done all over the United
States,'' the Democratic presidential front-runner said Thursday,
signing the nation's first law to make health insurance available
to all Bay Staters by 1992.
   ``We have made a great start,'' he told about 2,000 supporters
crowded onto the Statehouse steps for the signing ceremony. ``Now
we must make it work. And then we must carry the message of health
care for all across all this country.''
   Dukakis said universal health care was under discussion in
Massachusetts for nearly two years before it passed the
Legislature, it has been 40 years since Harry S. Truman proposed it
for the nation.
   ``As an American, I don't want my country to stand alone with
South Africa as the only two industrialized nations that do not
provide basic health security for their citizens,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis supports a bill by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., calling
for minimum health care guarantees ``as the first step towards
providing health insurance to all Americans,'' said Dukakis
campaign spokesman Steve Akey.
   The governor also supports states taking their own initiative to
offer universal health care, Statehouse press secretary James
Dorsey said.
   The Massachusetts bill was the outcome of a nine-month
legislative struggle and comes two years after Massachusetts voters
voted 2-1 for a non-binding referendum urging Congress to enact a
national health care program.
   Dr. David U. Himmelstein of Harvard Medical School, spokesman
for Physicians for a National Health Program, called the health
care bill a first step but ``a Band-Aid approach when major surgery
is needed.''
   On Wednesday, Dukakis estimated that the law's cost to taxpayers
would be $645.2 million through fiscal 1992, less about $22.5
million in projected cost-cutting in Medicaid. Other estimates put
the cost to the state government in the next four years as high as
$1.2 billion.
   The law would provide coverage to about 600,000 Massachusetts
residents under age 65 currently without health insurance, or
roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth.
   This would be done in stages and through a variety of
approaches, from extending Medicaid benefits for disabled adults
and children to state-brokered, pooled insurance for small
businesses and individuals.
   By 1992, all employers with more than five full-time employees
must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment
surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured.
   Under the proposal, the state also would take control of a $300
million-a-year pool for indigents that is funded from hospital
surcharges on the insured.
   Senate Ways and Means Chairman Patricia McGovern, who proposed
the idea of universal health care in Massachusetts more than a year
ago, acknowledged that risks were involved in the undertaking.
   ``In the end I think we regret what we have never done _ not
what we've tried and we've failed but what we've never tried,'' she
said. ``This whole effort is about the ability to take a risk.''

   The Kuwait Airways hijack has spawned plenty of
proposals from governments, anti-terrorism experts and the public
on how to tackle air piracy, but each idea invariably contains a
serious pitfall.
   They range from a West German lawmaker's suggestion that
knockout gas be pumped into hijacked planes, to the International
Air Transport Association's call for an international brigade to
fight terrorism.
   The hijack drama, which ended in Algiers on Wednesday, left a
bittersweet taste around Europe, where it unfolded daily through
live TV broadcasts. The anguish and frustration it engendered was
reflected in calls to radio talkshows and letters to newspapers
proposing various anti-hijack strategies.
   There was rejoicing that the ordeal ended peacefully and that
Kuwait apparently stood firm against demands for the release of 17
jailed pro-Iranian terrorists.
   Experts noted that hijackings have fallen from 95 in 1969 to
fewer than 20 a year in the 1980s. They also pointed to the
difficulty the hijackers had in landing the Kuwaiti jumbo jet,
saying it showed that the refusal of airports to deal with air
pirates is almost universal.
   But there was outrage that the nine hijackers, having killed two
passengers and put others through a horrifying ordeal, apparently
escaped unpunished.
   ``At the risk of sounding churlish, the ending of one of the
longest hijackings in aviation history is not an occasion for
unrestrained rejoicing,'' commented The Independent, a London
newspaper.
   Experts say the biggest problem is airport security. Some
airports are extremely strict, such as in Tel Aviv where departing
passengers are interrogated, while others are dangerously lax.
   Paul Sheppard, security chief at the International Civil
Aviation Organization, likens security to ``a great spider web over
the whole world, and there's no way of plugging up every single
gap. The chain of security is only as strong as its weakest link.''
   Authorities in Bangkok, where the airliner was parked before the
hijacking, say guns could have been smuggled aboard before the
plane reached Thailand. But they are investigating suspicions that
Thai catering staff were bribed into helping the hijackers.
   ``Ground staff are very poorly paid in Third World countries,''
says Ian Geldard of the Institute for the Study of Terrorism.
   ``And if people there can be bribed, hijackers are going to go
for Third World countries.''
   One measure proposed by Geldard's London institute is to store
passengers' passports in the baggage hold, thus making it difficult
for hijackers to identify hostages for execution by nationality.
   The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported that a California rabbi
was in Tel Aviv selling a hijack survival kit containing a false
passport, ID and credit card to Israelis who have good reason to
conceal their identities from hijackers. Maariv said the kit costs
a hefty $165.
   Richard Clutterbuck, an English anti-terrorism expert, proposes
issuing a fingerprinted clearance card entitling bona fide
passengers to clear airports speedily, while those with no card
would be searched.
   But Geldard says the system won't work, because states that
sponsor terrorism will have little trouble obtaining the clearance
cards.
   West German lawmaker Johannes Gerster suggests a gas to ``put
the hijackers and the passengers to sleep lightning-quick.'' The
danger, some experts say, is that if the gas failed to work
instantly, it would leave the hijackers enough time to detonate
explosives.
   Clutterbuck says sophisticated machinery is being developed to
detect explosives thermally or by neutron bombardment. But the
problem, he acknowledged in an interview, is that it is expensive.
   The Geneva-based International Air Transport Association,
representing 168 airlines in 114 countries, proposes new
international courts to try hijackers and an international commando
brigade.
   But Geldard called this ``a utopian dream,'' saying in an
interview: ``It's difficult enough to get collaboration even with
firmest allies. In a lot of countries the different intelligence
agencies don't even cooperate among themselves.''
   IATA spokesman David Kyd recalled the 1978 summit at which the
seven leading industrial democracies threatened sanctions against
countries that fail to bring hijackers to justice.
   The threat has only once been implemented, against Afghanistan,
he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio, adding: ``One wonders why
it hasn't been applied more often.''
   Clutterbuck said: ``In a perfect world it would of course have
been far better if the hijackers hadn't been released. But I think
that would have been too much to expect.''
   But Kyd said that by releasing the hijackers, Algeria had set
itself up as ``a soft touch'' for terrorists. He said hijackers
should be punished, ``whatever that takes. If it means prolonging
the suffering of other hostages aboard an aircraft, then so be it.''

<HEAD>Ban On Nuclear-Armed Warships Raises NATO Frustration With Denmark</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Denmark's move to bolster its ban on
visiting nuclear-armed warships has focused attention on a NATO
ally that already suffers from a reputation as an unreliable
comrade-in-arms.
   NATO long has complained that Denmark does not pull its weight
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Its annual defense
spending _ 2.2 percent of its gross national product in 1987 _ is
the lowest of NATO's European members except for Greece and Italy.
   For 31 years, Denmark has had a general policy banning nuclear
arms from its soil in peacetime. Until now, Danish officials took
the position of assuming that visiting warships would obey.
   Last week, Parliament voted to demand that warships be told they
cannot carry nuclear arms into Danish ports.
   At NATO headquarters here, officials say the measure, if
implemented, would render NATO's reinforcement strategy for Denmark
useless.
   The measure led Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's minority
government to call for early elections May 10.
   The center-right government opposes the nuclear-armed warship
measure and maintains Danes remain loyal to NATO.
   One Danish NATO official said that in a marriage, ``it behooves
either partner not to be confrontational.''
   ``We should not exaggerate the situation but accept there are
differences of opinion within NATO,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Such comments do little to calm the nerves of NATO officials
whose primary concern is to maintain an iron-clad consensus about
defense, notably nuclear arms.
   NATO members Norway and Spain both prohibit the stationing of
nuclear arms on their soil during peacetime. But neither requires
visiting NATO warships to declare whether they are carrying such
arms.
   In 1984, the United States and Britain broke off military
cooperation with New Zealand after that country began insisting
that warships say whether or not they carry nuclear weapons.
   ``We know that in some cases allied warships carried nuclear
arms into our ports,'' said the Danish official. ``This, of course,
was not allowed but we closed one eye,'' said the Danish official.
   To tell visiting warships they cannot carry nuclear arms into
Danish ports would, said NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington,
``run counter to the basis of NATO strategy and the principles of
shared burdens and benefits'' of alliance membership.
   The United States and Britain, which would rush to Denmark's aid
in times of crisis with troops and materiel, have a policy of never
saying whether their warships have nuclear arms.
   A U.S. NATO official said this week that the stricter
anti-nuclear stand, if taken to its logical conclusion, would mean
NATO allies cannot reinforce Denmark during a crisis before the
outbreak of war.
   Failure to reinforce NATO's choke-point on the Soviet Union's
Baltic fleet would affect not just Denmark but also neighboring
West Germany.
   ``It's clear this is not a Danish-American or Danish-British
problem, but a matter for all of the alliance,'' said a senior West
German NATO source, also speaking privately.
   The controversy led NATO to move next week's NATO defense
ministers meeting from Denmark to Brussels. The meeting will focus
on nuclear defense issues.
   In 1985, Mchael Hesseltine, then British defense secretary,
warned Danes not to expect British soldiers to come to their aid if
they don't do more for their own defense.
   Last March, Danish Lt. Gen. Poul Thorsen, NATO's top commander
for the Baltic Approaches, resigned and said he could no longer
``represent Denmark in a reasonable manner.'' He said Danish
defense was being ``maltreated'' through gross underfinancing.

<HEAD>Producers Claim Writers Strike Causing $15 Million In Losses So
Far</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Hollywood scriptwriters' strike has cost
their industry more than $15 million, producers say, blaming much
of the loss to production halts on such hit series as ``The Cosby
Show'' and ``L.A. Law.''
   Directors, actors, production crew workers and secretaries were
among thos hit by the Writers Guild of America strike, Herb
Steinberg, a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers, said Thursday.
   He said about 1,400 employees who work in production areas other
than writing have been laid off as a result of the seven-week-old
strike.
   The 9,000-member guild went on strike March 7 over issues of
residuals from movies and television shows distributed in foreign
countries and a producers' proposal to restructure residual
payments for hourlong television shows sold into syndication.
   ``We have no way of verifying the information they put out,''
said Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden. ``However, we do question
whether they have taken into consideration the normal seasonal
layoffs that have occurred because of (the television season)
hiatus.''
   Steinberg said the layoffs and costs tabulated by the producers
were chiefly from 22 regular season television episodes from shows
such as ``L.A. Law'' and ``The Cosby Show,'' which were not
produced because of lack of scripts.
   ``This has nothing whatsoever to do with the seasonal layoffs,''
said Steinberg. ``It has nothing to do with the hiatus.''
   Two federally mediated sessions on April 18 and March 14 ended
without resumption of negotiations. No new talks are scheduled.
   The strike curtailed the seasons of several television shows and
could threaten the start of the fall television season if it
continues into the summer.
   According to statistics gathered by the alliance, a bargaining
organization of more than 200 studios and producers, the strike
thus far has cost 1,062 cast and crew members an estimated $12.7
million in salaries and benefits.
   Some 210 secretaries and other officer staffers have been laid
off as a result of the strike, and lost an estimated $756,000 in
salaries. The strike also has affected 207 so-called ``writer
hyphenates,'' who have lost fees, salaries and benefits worth an
estimated $2.2 million.
   A writer hyphenate is generally a writer-producer, someone who
is developing a television show or movie. Because they are on
strike as writers, they cannot advance work on scripts or ideas.
   Steinberg said the alliance's analysis concludes that 45,000
person-days have been lost as a result of the strike.
   ``If the Alliance wants to see a speedy end to the strike the
best way to assure that would be to return to the table and
continue a dialogue that can resolve the outstanding issues,'' Ms.
Rhoden said.
   Steinberg said the last 20-minute meeting between the new sides
had been requested by the writers, but the union had no new offers.

<HEAD>Dukakis Urged To Pick Southerner or Westerner As Running Mate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael S. Dukakis is
getting loads of advice on where to turn for a running mate, with
many party leaders urging him to avoid Jesse Jackson and turn to a
Southern senator.
   But the Massachusetts governor indicated Thursday he wants
maximum breathing room as he searches for someone to fill the No. 2
spot on the Democratic ticket.
   ``Obviously you look at regions where you could use some help,''
said former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia. ``The South and West are
the regions. You also look at a philosophical segment where you
could use some shoring up and I guess that would be with moderate
conservative voters.''
   Robb, who had urged Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia to run for
president, said he would like to see Nunn as the vice presidential
candidate, but only if the senator were offered the opportunity to
serve as secretary of defense at the same time.
   Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. predicted that the vice
presidential nominee would be ``a senator from the South or
Southwest.''
   ``I wouldn't make that judgment at all,'' Dukakis said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   He also rejected suggestions that if Jackson finishes second in
the race for the presidential nomination, he ought to be given the
No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn't entitle me to anything
more than consideration, period,'' Dukakis said.
   The discussion of potential Dukakis running mates began to
intensify after the Massachusetts governor's strong victory in the
New York primary established him as the likely Democratic
presidential nominee.
   ``I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will
not, unless and until I have either won the nomination, or it looks
as if it's pretty well in hand,'' Dukakis insisted.
   ``If that happens, then I will begin what I hope will be a
thoughtful and thorough process of selecting a running mate. But
I'm not going to do anything on that _ quite literally _ until the
California and New Jersey primaries are over.''
   Dukakis said the paramount concern in choosing a running mate
ought to be a candidate's ability to serve as a ``first-rate
president if, God forbid, something happened to the president.''
   ``All else pales by comparison,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor, who has been faulted in the campaign
for his lack of experience in foreign affairs, disputed the view
that he needs to select a running mate with experience in
international issues.
   ``You pick a secretary of state to be your key foreign policy
adviser, and a national security adviser and secretary of
defense,'' he said, adding that ``you don't necessarily need
another secretary of state'' as vice president.
   There were mixed opinions on the value of Jesse Jackson as a
running mate.
   Robb said Jackson ``doesn't fill in the kind of strengths he
(Dukakis) needs.''
   ``Both Dukakis and Jackson on the ticket together is not the
best political decision you can make,'' said Robert G. Beckel,
campaign manager for Walter F. Mondale when he was the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1984.
   ``I think everybody fully expects to see a Southerner this
time,'' said Al Lapierre, executive director of the Alabama
Democratic Party.
   He said Jackson on the ticket would hurt Dukakis because there
still are many people who will not accept a black.
   ``The sad part is, not voting for him because of disagreement on
issues or lack of experience in government, that's OK, that's what
politics is all about. The race thing, you hate to say it, but it's
there.''
   At a news conference Wednesday, Jackson said, ``I need his
(Dukakis) support base to win. He needs my support base to win.
Together we can win.''
   Asked if he were talking about a Dukakis-Jackson ticket, the
candidate said, ``No. It's just the challenge we have to pull
together our constituencies.''
   ``He's not running for vice president and I didn't sign on with
him for vice president,'' Willie Brown, the national chairman of
Jackson's campaign and the speaker of the California Assembly, said
Thursday.
   But, Brown said, ``I think a Dukakis-Jackson (ticket) would be
good. I think a Jackson-Dukakis would be the best for the
Democrats.''
   ``I think Jackson has worked hard and perhaps earned it if he
wants it,'' said Fred Brown, a Democratic National Committee member
from Coffeyville, Kan.
   ``It doesn't bother me if a black is on the ticket,'' he added.
``People want to win.''

   What do Michael Jackson and the Orioles have in
common? Both wear a glove for no apparent reason.
   That's one of the jokes making the rounds about the winless team
that's also known as the Zer-O's.
   Fans of the Baltimore Orioles are laughing on the outside, but
crying on the inside as they watch their team soar _ like a stone.
   ``They need to get psychotherapy,'' banker Mark Swensen of
Baltimore said Thursday. ``I'm not going to watch the games until
they start winning. I can't handle it. I get nauseous.''
   Wednesday's loss to the Milwaukee Brewers gave the Orioles the
dubious distinction of being the first major league team in history
to lose 14 games at the start of the season. They continued their
losing ways Thursday, falling 7-1 to the Brewers in Milwaukee.
   But fans in Birdland say it will take more than a string of
losses to kill the pride they have in the team that won the World
Series five years ago and six pennants from 1966 to 1983.
   ``I think they're the best,'' said Chris Slowinski, 28, a sales
representative for a beer company. ``People around here are Bird
fanatics. It's embarrassing, because there is a winning tradition
here in Baltimore. I have season tickets. I go to the games
expecting them to win.''
   Disc jockey Bob Rivers, who vowed to stay on the air at WIYY-FM
until the Orioles break the skid, was a trifle grouchy Thursday
after broadcasting for more than 58 hours. He has napped briefly
between music sets since Tuesday.
   ``I'm a little irritable. I'm a little cranky. ... I can see the
bags under my eyes,'' he said. ``But I'm holding up my commitment.''
   Patty Waters, an administrative assistant in the Orioles' public
relations office, said the telephones have been ringing off the
hook as fans called to offer encouragement and suggestions.
   ``One lady wanted to hold a mass positive thinking seminar for
the fans and the club,'' Ms. Waters said. ``One lady recommended
hypnosis. She said if she hypnotized all of them, and let them know
how good they are,'' the streak would end.
   ``We have a group of letters from a local school. I don't know
if the teacher was making fun of us, but the kids' letters
suggested (the players) chew gum and stick it on the end of their
bats to help make contact, or put it in their gloves so they might
catch a ball,'' Ms. Waters said.
   A regular caller to her office this week has been Baltimore Joe,
a New York man who changed his name to reflect his affection for
the city.
   ``He's calling to say hi. He's apparently taking a lot of
ribbing from friends who support the Yankees,'' Ms. Waters said.
   Chuck Litty, 42, a lifelong fan and member of the Orioles
Advocates, a baseball promotion and volunteer civic organization in
Baltimore, figures the odds are with the team at this point.
   ``Besides the fact that they're playing bad, they're snakebit,''
Litty said. ``As each game progresses, the more these guys are
putting pressure upon themselves. Once they get this victory _ and
I know they will get it _ maybe things will straighten out and they
will become a competitive team.
   ``I can't understand it. I know this is a better ballclub than
what we're showing. We've had a long history of being a successful
ballclub. I'm just dealing with it day to day and hoping they break
out of it.''

<HEAD>`Didn't Work Out Exactly The Way I Planned,' Gore Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. made his exit from
the 1988 presidential race with this succinct analysis of his
debt-burdened bid: ``I was doing great until I turned 40.''
   Gore's departure Thursday narrowed the Democratic presidential
race down to two _ front-runner Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
It was forced by Gore's failure to score a breakthrough in any
state of the North, ending with New York on Tuesday.
   The Tennessee senator ran much of his campaign burdened by the
notion that at age 39 he was too young, and expressed relief upon
turning 40 at the end of March.
   But by then the high point of his campaign had come and gone _
the Super Tuesday contests six weeks ago when he won five Southern
primaries.
   He never fared better than a 17 percent showing in Wisconsin
after that.
   ``Things didn't work out exactly the way I had planned,'' Gore,
flanked by his wife, parents and children, told supporters jammed
into a Senate office building.
   ``I lost this race, and that is a disappointment,'' Gore said.
``But some things matter to me more than winning _ helping my
party, serving my country, knowing when to keep fighting and
knowing when I've been licked.''
   Gore technically left his campaign in a suspended state. While
acknowledging he wouldn't be the nominee or campaign any more, Gore
maintains a candidacy that permits all his delegates to attend the
Democratic National Convention.
   Gore amassed 423 Democratic National Convention delegates during
his campaign, according to The Associated Press count. Under party
rules, delegate slots he has already won but for which people have
not yet been chosen could have been awarded to other candidates,
had he not remained technically a candidate.
   Jackson would have gained 34 of Gore's delegates immediately,
while Dukakis would have gotten 29. Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's
decision to suspend his campaign denied Jackson another 47
delegates he would have inherited in this manner.
   Gore said he spoke with both Dukakis and Jackson and that both
were ``comfortable'' with his decision to hold onto the delegates
since neither would have gained significantly. He said the move
would protect Democratic leaders who backed him in states where
delegates had not yet been chosen, naming Georgia as an example.
   He said he planned no endorsement and repeated his oft-stated
contention that he has ``no interest'' in the vice presidential
nomination, though he left that door open.
   ``I'm not trying in any way to broker a convention that is not
going to be brokered anyway,'' he said.
   In departing, Gore delivered some of the most eloquent lines of
his campaign. He offered praise for his Democratic opponents during
the long campaign, saying that each had taught him something.
   Jackson, he said, taught him that ``a successful president must
be both a chief executive and a preacher.'' It was a line that
recalled the criticism he leveled at Jackson in New York two weeks
ago, when Gore said the nation was choosing a president not a
preacher.
   He excoriated President Reagan and Vice President George Bush,
saying they had brought ``the most selfish generation of
leadership'' in American history.
   ``We have been subjected for eight years to a man who quotes our
heroes against us,'' he said. ``But Franklin D. Roosevelt does not
belong to a man who does not even see the homeless on our streets.''
   He promised support for the eventual Democratic nominee.
   ``I want no part of a stop-Jackson or a stop-Dukakis movement,''
Gore said. ``The only man I want to stop is George Bush.''

   For awhile, Holly Lavalla and Daniel Morelli
thought about what they could do with their $13,615 refund check
from the Internal Revenue Service. Unhappily, they decided to send
it back.
   ``When it's that big you send it back, because you know they'll
hunt this down,'' Lavalla told The Times of Beverly. ``It's a very,
very tempting thing, when you look at five digits, with your name
on the check.''
   However she added, ``I need a couple more zeroes to hide all
that guilt.''
   Their check for $13,615, more than 25 times the approximately
$500 refund they expected, was nearly half of the couple's combined
yearly income.
   ```Whattaya mean we're going to send it back?''' Lavalla, a
hospital worker, recalled her husband saying. But she replied,
``Let's get back to earth now, Dan.''
   The couple's attorney informed Internal Revenue Service
officials of the check, which was returned Thursday.
   ``After she told them the amount of my check there was a very
lo-o-o-ong pause,'' said Lavalla. ``They were flabbergasted by the
amount.''
   Anita Castro, spokeswoman for the IRS Service Center in Andover,
said the the refund check ``is kind of extreme. That's not the
norm.'' She added, ``It could be a keypunch error, but it's got to
be more than that.''
   She declined to comment further until she has reviewed the case.

   There's no denying that Grandma Jane and
Nosey Rosie are fat cats. And that was before the felines inherited
an estimated $250,000 estate.
   Jane, who weighs in at 13 pounds, and 15-pound Rosie received
the lion's share of the estate of Dick Starkey, whose will
stipulates that his house be maintained and the cats allowed to
roam freely there until their deaths.
   At that time, the house and remainder of the estate will
establish a trust fund for the Dorchester County Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
   Starkey, who worked as a field engineer for Lockheed Missiles
and Space Co., and his wife, Imogene, always had animals around,
said Joe Inman, the administrator of Starkey's will. Stuckey died
last December and his wife died in 1986.
   Inman's wife Doris said all the photos she's been able to find
of the Stuckeys show them with their pets. She said they would buy
gifts for their animals and put gifts under the tree at Christmas.
   ``They did for their animals what we did for our children,''
said Inman's wife, Doris.
   James Messervy, the attorney for the estate, said it will be
several years before the SPCA receives the funds. He said about
$50,000 of the estate will also go to establish a trust fund for
the SPCA in Starkey's hometown of Guymon, Okla.

   In what may rank as one of the great
political compromises, the Oklahoma Senate came up with a way to
name the same bridge for two people.
   A resolution adopted Thursday by the Senate asks the state
Department of Transportation to name the span's two directions for
two legislators, Rep. Lonnie Abbott and Sen. Kelly Haney.
   The new bridge crosses the South Canadian River, which is the
dividing line between Pontotoc County, represented by Abbott, and
Seminole County, which is included in Haney's district.
   So, when traveling south on Oklahoma 99, motorists will cross
the the Haney-Abbott bridge. When coming the other way, they'll see
a sign designating that same bridge as the Abbott-Haney bridge.
   ``We just reached a compromise,'' said Haney with a chuckle.

<HEAD>Alcohol Producers Opposing Labeling Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Beer and liquor producers say requiring
alcoholic beverage containers to carry health warning labels will
do little to solve problems of abuse.
   ``Labels are not education, and they don't really help solve the
problem of abuse,'' Jim Sanders, president of the Beer Institute,
said Thursday. ``We think it's really a false solution to a real
problem.''
   He called legislation to require such labels ``an emotional
overreaction.''
   Earlier, a bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers held a
news conference to outline their labeling legislation.
   ``The most harmful drug in America is alcohol,'' said Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Thurmond, who introduced his bill in February, said alcohol
abuse costs the U.S. economy about $120 billion a year, including
increased medical expenses and lost productivity. Alcohol-related
traffic accidents claim 18,000 lives each year, he added.
   ``It's a very rare family in this country today that has not
been hit by some of the ravages of alcoholism one way or another,''
said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a cosponsor of the bill.
   Glenn, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
said the panel has scheduled a series of hearings on the alcohol
problem.
   The legislation would require the placement of one of five
alternating labels on each alcoholic beverage container.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who introduced the House version of
the bill Thursday, said the labels would warn about the dangers of
drinking and driving, of drinking while pregnant and of combining
alcohol with other drugs.
   In addition the labels would say that alcohol may be addictive
and that its consumption can increase the risk of developing
hypertension, liver disease and cancer.
   Susan Sullivan, an actress on the television series Falcon
Crest, said her father was an alcoholic, but that he would have
wanted his children to know the dangers of alcohol.
   ``It seems to me incredible that we do not have these warning
labels on alcohol bottles when it is such a dangerous drug,'' said
Ms. Sullivan.
   Christine Lubinski, Washington representative for the National
Council on Alcoholism, said the primary source of alcohol
information available to the American public comes from $2 billion
in advertising aimed at depicting alcohol as ``a glamorous, magic
potion.''
   Ms. Lubinski said the warning labels will institutionalize
public health messages about the risks associated with alcohol
consumption.
   But Janet Flynn, spokeswoman for the Distilled Spirits Council
of the United States, said the group opposes warning labels.
   ``We believe that the warning labels for alcohol beverage
containers are unnecessary,'' said Ms. Flynn. ``And they are
unnecessary because the claims concerning the risks of alcohol
consumption are well known.''

   F-16 fighter jets swooshed across the
sky and paratroopers performed precision jumps as Israel displayed
its military might in a 40th Independence Day celebration marred by
the Palestinian uprising.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres visited troops in the occupied
West Bank town of Bethlehem and called for restraint in quelling
Arab protests in the occupied lands, saying excessive force would
only radicalize Palestinians.
   ``If we act with restraint, they (the Arabs) will realize that
violence leads them nowhere, and they will have to look for a
solution, and we're ready to talk about a solution,'' said Peres,
head of the center-left Labor Party.
   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Peres' political rival, took
a hard stand, saying: ``The Arab side is still not ready for
peace.''
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, told Israel radio
that peace talks ``shouldn't take place under the (threat) of
stone-throwing and violence.''
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, which has growing support
in the territories, issued an underground booklet calling for a
stepped-up struggle against Israel.
   ``Our style of resistance is according to what God told us: Kill
them wherever you find them. This is the solution for those who
follow the Koran,'' the Moslem holy book, the booklet said.
   Few clashes were reported Thursday in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the lands Israel captured from Egypt and Jordan in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   General strikes paralyzed towns and cities Thursday in the
occupied lands, where about 400,000 Arabs, nearly a third of the
population there, remained under curfew for a fifth day.
   For a second day, the army closed Israel to Arab residents of
the occupied lands. The security measure for Independence Day was
to remain in effect until after Moslem prayers today.
   Journalists were barred from most parts of the West Bank and
Gaza.
   In the Arab village of Isawiya north of Jerusalem, police fired
rubber bullets at Palestinians who threw stones and raised black
flags to mourn slain Palestine Liberation Organization military
commander Khalil Wazir.
   New details emerged about Saturday's assassination of Wazir, who
was gunned down at his home in a suburb of the Tunisian capital,
Tunis.
   A Tunisian report said the job was done by an elite Israeli
commando squad and Israeli sources, speaking privately to The
Associated Press, agreed.
   The Israeli sources also have told the AP that the team operated
under the direct command of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron and
stole documents during the raid at Wazir's home.
   The sources said the government approved the operation on two
previous occasions in recent weeks but canceled it at the last
minute for technical reasons.
   Israel's government has refused comment, and Shamir said
Thursday: ``I don't think anyone has anything to say about this.''
   Meanwhile, Israel topped off its Independence Day celebrations
with a military show watched by about 40,000 people at Ramat Gan
Stadium near Tel Aviv and broadcast live on television.
   Fighter planes spewing blue-and-white steam, the flag colors,
flew loops and circled in formations spelling the numeral 40.
   U.S.-made F-16s crossed the sky and paratroopers in white
jumpsuits performed precision freefall jumps from 45,000 feet. One
waved an Israeli flag as he glided toward the stadium floor.
   ``We all love the army and our soldiers,'' said Yossi, a police
officer deployed at one of the stadium gates. ``It's a day that
unites the country.''
   Yossi, who would not give his last name, said the Arab uprising
dampened his joy, adding: ``We want to live in peace with the
Arabs, but they are not ready to accept this.''
   Since the Dec. 8 start of the anti-occupation protests, 169
Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed.
   ``Israel stayed independent because it has been able to protect
itself,'' said one of the cheering spectators, Sheila Schlussel,
50, of Teaneck, N.J. ``Israel is getting a bad press because of
what is happening in the territories. We came here to express our
support.''
   Elsewhere, Israelis celebrated the anniversary with picnics,
hikes, fireworks and the annual international Bible quiz, in which
17-year-old Jeremy Weider, of Monsey, N.Y., tied for first place.
   As an Independence Day present to Israel, the United States
signed the most comprehensive pact to date between the two
countries, formalizing economic and military agreements.
   The agreement, signed in Jerusalem by Shamir and U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Pickering, will be binding for future administrations.
   ``This is the most friendly administration we have ever worked
with,'' said Shamir. ``They are determined that the strong
friendship and cooperation will continue and even be strengthened
despite the differences that crop up from time to time.''

Black, speaking from the Tudor-style home south of San Francisco

   Actor James Garner was in satisfactory
condition after undergoing quintuple bypass surgery to alleviate a
heart problem he attributed to cigarettes.
   ``He had five hours of surgery in which the coronary arteries of
his heart were bypassed. The surgery went very smoothly,'' Ron
Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said Thursday.
   Garner, 60, entered the medical center, sometimes called
``hospital to the stars'' for its celebrity patients, on Monday for
tests. He has blamed his heart problem on cigarette smoking.
   Doctors had planned to perform surgery for an aneurysm, or
ballooning, of his aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the
heart. But a series of tests conducted this week determined that
Garner should have a quintuple bypass.
   ``The aneurysm will be taken care of at a later date,'' said
Wise, who gave Garner's condition as satisfactory.

<TEXT>
   The federal budget deficit grew more than
expected in March, but the cumulative red ink in the first six
months of the fiscal year is still 3.5 percent smaller than a year
ago, the government says.
   The Treasury Department said Thursday that the March deficit was
$29.1 billion, up from $23.9 billion in February and 2.7 percent
larger than March 1987. Economists had been predicting a monthly
deficit of $24 billion to $26 billion.
   Michael Evans, head of an economic forecasting service in
Washington, said some federal spending was probably deferred to
March from February, when outlays were somewhat smaller than
expected.
   Analysts also said the budget imbalance is usually higher in
March than in other months because people who owe taxes generally
wait until April to pay, while those due a refund normally file
early.
   For the first half of the 1988 fiscal year, the government has
run a deficit of $118.9 billion, 3.5 percent lower than the red ink
incurred for the same period a year ago.
   For the entire fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the Reagan
administration is projecting a deficit of $146.7 billion, down 2.4
percent from the $150.4 billion deficit in 1987.
   However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the deficit
will climb to $157 billion.
   Last year, the deficit fell sharply because of an unexpected $28
billion windfall in tax payments made by people who sold off
long-term assets before the capital gains rates were increased
under the new tax law.
   Some analysts say there could be a second, smaller windfall this
year if people end up owing more in taxes for 1987 than they would
have under the old tax law.
   ``April is the big question mark with the tax returns coming
in,'' Evans said.
   In March, government revenue totaled $65 billion, while spending
totaled $94.1 billion. For the first half of the year, revenues
total $412.0 billion while spending amounted to $530.9 billion.
   As usual, the largest spending categories in March were the
military followed by Social Security, interest on the national debt
and other programs in the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Military spending totaled $25.8 billion last month and $142.3
billion for the fiscal year so far, up 5.6 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled $18.4 billion last month
and $105.0 billion for the past six months, up 5.6 percent from the
same period in the 1987 fiscal year. Social Security is exempted
from budget limitations under the Gramm-Rudman law and is therefore
generally showing faster spending increases than the other
categories.
   The other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent
$14.2 billion in March and $77.5 billion so far this budget year, a
5.9 percent increase over 1987.
   Interest on the $2.5 trillion national debt _ nearly one fifth
of total government spending _ was $14.4 billion last month and
$105.2 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 9.6 percent
over the same period last year.

<HEAD>House, Senate Subcommittees OK $8 Million SSC Funds Transfer</HEAD>

   Congressional permission to transfer $8
million in Energy Department money from administration to the
superconducting super collider avoids delays in the physics
research project, the department says.
   Most of the money will be used to prepare environmental impact
statements on prospective sites, Phil Keif, Energy Department
spokesman, said Thursday.
   ``We have to go through that in order to select a site, so it
keeps us on schedule,'' Keif said. Had the transfer of money been
rejected, ``it just would have delayed things,'' he said.
   Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich., said the transfer was cleared by an
agreement between House and Senate subcommittee chairmen concerned
with funding for the $4.4 billion project, which physicists plan to
use to study the basic structure of matter.
   ``Obviously, this approval demonstrates a certain level of
support for the project within the subcommittee leadership which,
as an advocate of the project, I'm delighted to see,'' said
Pursell, a member of the House energy appropriations subcommittee.
   Requests to transfer money that has already been appropriated
require the consent of the chairman and ranking minority member of
the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees handling the
money. The $8 million had been appropriated for the 1988 fiscal
year.
   The committees last month had denied the Energy Department's
request to transfer the money amid substantial congressional
opposition to the project.
   Seven states have been selected as potential sites for the super
collider, which will include a 53-mile-round particle accelerator.
The finalists are Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North
Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
   President Reagan has asked Congress to approve $363 million for
the project for fiscal 1989, although House supporters have said
they would seek $100 million because of budget-balancing concerns.
   The project is expected to create 4,000 permanent jobs and have
an annual budget of $280 million.

<TEXT>
   An American survivor of the 1943 escape
from Sobibor Nazi death camp, who has waged a lonely fight to have
it preserved as a memorial, returned this week and wept at the
sound of Israel's national anthem.
   Thomas Blatt, surrounded by a small group of friends, joined
them in singing the Hatikvah, or The Hope.
   They stood next to the grass-covered mound of ashes and bones
which likely contains the remains of both of Blatt's parents and of
his little brother.
   ``I could never imagine that I could stand here someday and hear
singing of the Hatikvah in this spot,'' said Blatt, 60, of Santa
Barbara, Calif.
   ``I hope there is another world and that all the people, from
Holland, from France (who also died at Sobibor) are listening
too,'' he said.
   It was a day of vindication for Blatt. He was accompanied by a
Polish official who confirmed publicly that Poland would replace an
erroneous sign at the camp's entrance which lists the 250,000
victims as Soviet prisoners of war, Jews, Poles and Gypsies.
   ``Here the victims were all Jews,'' said Lee Kagan, president of
the Holocaust Sites Preservation Committee, founded by Blatt.
   Blatt, a Polish Jew, was 15 when he arrived at Sobibor in April
1943. He watched as his mother, father and brother were marched off
to their deaths. He was spared by the caprice of the camp
commander, who needed a shoeshine boy.
   Six months later, Blatt took part in the camp's successful
uprising, in which most of the Nazis were killed and 300 prisoners
escaped. About 50 of those escaped prisoners survived the war. The
story was the topic of a CBS television movie last year, ``Escape
from Sobibor.''
   Blatt survived the war, fighting with partisans against the
Germans, and eventually emigrated to the United States. He has
revisited the camp many times and has repeatedly protested its
unkempt condition and the misleading sign.
   Kagan thanked Jacek Wilczur, a historian with Poland's Main
Commission for the Investigation of Nazi War Crimes-Institute of
National Remembrance, for agreeing to change the inscription.
   Noting that Sobibor was the site of the only successful mass
uprising at a concentration camp, Kagan said:
   ``We would like to thank you for restoring a page in Jewish
history. There are still people who think Jews went like sheep into
places like this. And it's not true. Here, at the site of their
biggest revolt, I'd like to thank you.''
   Blatt obtained the promises from Polish officials to correct the
sign and make other improvements in a meeting last August.
   When he returned to the camp Wednesday, he found flowers planted
in front of the mound, a fresh coat of paint along the borders and
a glass exhibition case at the entrance showing an architect's
plans for the camp.
   Among the changes planned are fencing in the camp, reshaping
pathways, erecting exhibits that would tell the story of Sobibor,
and encircling the mound with Jewish cemetery tombstones, which
were torn down by the Nazis for use as paving.
   Polish workers will make the improvements with money raised by
the U.S. Committee. The project is expected to cost $375,000.
   Blatt had another suggestion for the architect. Walking to a
field near the mound, where the camp crematoriums were located, he
reached at random into the dirt and sifted pieces of human bone
through his fingers.
   He said that the field is used by farmers to graze cattle and
should be covered with a concrete slab to protect the remains.
   Wilczur, in his remarks to the group of about 20 people, said
Polish Jews and non-Jews alike shared a common awful fate at the
hands of the Nazis.
   ``The died for the same reason: Because one was a Jew and the
other a Pole,'' he said.
   Referring to the 3 million Polish Jews killed in the Holocaust,
about the same number as non-Jewish Poles who died under the Nazis,
Wilczur said: ``They were truly our brothers, in life, in the
moment of dying, and now in their graves.''
   Wilczur added: ``Any kind of chauvinism, nationalism,
totalitarianism, leads in the end to a Treblinka or a Sobibor. One
they call Sobibor, another they call Katyn,'' the site in the
Soviet Union where about 4,000 Polish officers were found executed
in World War II.
   ``Murder is murder. The blood of innocents is the blood of
innocents.''

   Cancer patients who got morphine at the touch of
a button to relieve pain stopped using the drug sooner, and used
little more than half the narcotic than patients who got a
continuous infusion, a researcher says.
   ``These patients don't even come close to developing
addiction,'' said C. Richard Chapman, associate research director
at the Pain Center of the University of Washington and director of
the pain and toxicity research program at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center in Seattle.
   The shorter time on the drug is important because it means an
earlier end to confusion, sedation and other unpleasant reactions
that accompany morphine treatment, he said.
   ``In order to cope you need all your marbles. You can't be
coping effectively when you're on the drug,'' he said.
   He spoke in a recent interview about research done with
Hutchinson colleagues including Harlan Hill, Costantino Benedetti
and others.
   They studied hospitalized patients who had undergone bone marrow
transplantation as part of cancer therapy. As a result of cancer
treatment, such patients commonly suffer pain for two or three
weeks in the mouth and through the digestive tract, and sometimes
in the hands and feet and elsewhere, Chapman said.
   In the study, 32 patients got a continuous infusion of morphine
through an intravenous line, the standard treatment, Chapman said.
Twenty-six others got doses by pushing a button on an electric pump
hooked up to an intravenous line.
   The pump was programmed to give no more than one milligram of
morphine every 10 minutes. For each group, the decision to stop
treatment was made jointly between the patient and medical staff,
Chapman said.
   Patients who controlled their morphine used the drug an average
of about 13 days, while those who received a continuous intravenous
infusion averaged more than 17 days.
   The self-administering group also used only 53 percent as much
morphine as the other patients.
   While the study was not designed to look for addiction, no
self-adminstering patient reported cravings for the drug after the
treatment stopped, Chapman said.
   Self-administration of drugs might be useful for prolonged pain
of serious burns or terminal stages of cancer, he said. It would
not be suitable for pain that lasts for years, such as some cases
of low back pain, he said.
   So-called ``patient-controlled analgesia'' has been studied
extensively for short-term pain like that following surgery. But
the new work is the first large-scale study involving long-term
pain, said Richard Payne, associate professor of neurology at the
University of Cincinnati.
   The study is important because it shows patients can safely
control the amount of drug they get, gaining relief without
overdosing, he said.
   Chapman said results of the study have been submitted for
publication in a scientific journal.
   He spoke while in New York to receive a $50,000 pain research
grant to the university from the Bristol-Myers Co.
   Other pain grants were awarded to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Michigan, the University of Texas Medical Branch
at Galveston and the University of California School of Medicine.

<TEXT>
   The number of women in the military has
climbed to 10.3 percent of the total force, a post-World War II
high, according to a Pentagon report.
   At the same time, the Pentagon continues to see improvement in
the educational levels of its active-duty personnel. It also posted
a small increase last year in the number of civilian workers on the
payroll, and is paying out pensions to more than 1.5 million
individuals.
   And by all measures, California continues to lead the nation in
the number of individuals working for the Defense Department.
   Those and other statistics are contained in the latest edition
of an annual Pentagon study entitled ``Selected Manpower
Statistics.'' The new edition, published Thursday, consists of 222
pages of tables and covers fiscal 1987, which ended Sept. 30.
   The annual report offers the most comprehensive view available
of Pentagon employment patterns, as well as indicators of where
that force lives and how age, sex, education and family patterns
are changing.
   The latest edition shows that as of Sept. 30, the Pentagon had
2,160,727 men and women on active duty; another 13,490 men and
women in the three military academies, and 1,174,826 civilian
employees around the world, including foreign nationals.
   The active-duty total was essentially static compared to fiscal
1986 _ up about 5,100 _ while ``DoD civilian personnel increased by
about 21,800'' during the fiscal year, the report shows.
   Both the active-duty and civilian employment figures are
declining this year and will continue to fall to accommodate cuts
in the fiscal 1989 budget.
   In a section on active-duty trends, the report discloses that
there are now 222,338 female officers and enlisted personnel and
another 1,467 women in the various military academies, for a total
of 223,805.
   That represents 10.3 percent of the military force and is the
highest level recorded since 1945 when World War II ended with
266,256 women in the military.
   The report also shows that women managed to increase their
presence slightly at the military academies, where new officers are
trained. In fiscal 1985, females comprised 10.33 percent of the
academy students. In fiscal 1986, the figure climbed to 10.63
percent and last year, to 10.9 percent.
   The report says 53.35 percent of all military personnel are now
married _ down slightly from the 54.6 percent reported in fiscal
1986 _ and military personnel are supporting 2.8 million
dependents, also down slightly from the previous year.
   Every service _ the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Army _
continues to have more military dependents than it does active-duty
personnel, the report shows.
   On the educational side, the percentage of enlisted personnel in
the military who have completed high school increased by almost a
full percentage point last year _ from 96.5 percent to 97.2 percent.
   Earlier reports have shown a dramatic increase in the number of
new recruits with a high-school degree; the manpower study,
however, covers all enlisted personnel and not just recruits.
   The study also shows there are now 1.53 million ``military
annuitants'' supported by the Pentagon. An annuitant is an
individual who has either retired with a pension after a minimum 20
years of service, retired with benefits because of a disability, or
is a family entitled to survivor benefits.
   Most of the annuitants _ about 1.2 million _ are regular
pensioners. In 1950, there were only 58,752 such retirees. The
increase has already prompted Congress to revise the pension system
with an eye toward cutting future costs.
   California easily held down its longstanding No. 1 ranking in
Defense Department employees, with 206,495 military personnel and
137,677 civilians for a total of 344,172.
   It was followed by Virginia with 208,588 military and civilian
workers combined, then Texas with 202,027; North Carolina with
110,952; Florida with 109,057, and Georgia with 103,140.

<2ND_LINE>Anti-Acne Drug Linked to Hundreds of Birth Defects in Babies</2ND_LINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials are considering removing a
popular anti-acne drug from the market because they estimate it has
caused more than 900 babies to be born with severe birth defects,
The New York Times reported Friday.
   The officials said they are also considering asking the maker of
Accutane, Roche Laboratories, a division of Hoffman-La Roche Inc.,
to limit severely its distribution, the newspaper said. The drug is
used against disfiguring acne.
   A spokeswoman for the manufacturer Thursday night disputed the
figures, saying it has reports of 62 cases of Accutane-related
birth defects among the 700,000 to 1 million patients with cystic
acne for whom the drug has been prescribed.
   Despite clear warnings that the drug can cause devastating and
sometimes fatal deformities if taken by pregnant women, experts
estimate thousands have taken Accutane during pregnancy since it
came on the market in 1982, according to The Times.
   In a confidential memorandum dated Feb. 11 and obtained Thursday
by the Times, officials of the Food and Drug Administration
estimated that 900 to 1,300 babies were born with severe birth
defects because of the drug from 1982 to 1986.
   They also attributed 700 to 1,000 spontaneous abortions to the
use of Accutane, and they estimated that an additional 5,000 to
7,000 women had induced abortions ``solely because of Accutane
exposure and fear of birth defects,'' the newspaper reported.
   The estimates were extrapolated from data collected in a
Michigan Medicaid study.
   Carolyn Glynn, spokeswoman for Hoffman-LaRoche in Nutley, N.J.,
said the company would meet with the FDA on Tuesday to discuss ways
to better educate the public, doctors and pharmacists about the
dangerous, and often fatal side effects.
   ``We do not want to dispute the fact that this drug is
associated with birth defects,'' she said. ``We want to find ways
to further reinforce that message.''
   Ms. Glynn said that in the 62 cases of birth defects known to
the company, the babies were born with severe disfigurations,
primarily malformations of the head and ears. About half the
afflicted children died at birth, she said.
   Accutane accounts for between $40 million and $50 million in
sales annually, she said.
   The drug shuts down the production of sebum, which is the oily
fatty susbstance that causes the inflamation, pain and eventualy
scarring of cystic acne. The drug's generic name is isotretinoin.
   By September 1987, the Federal drug agency had received reports
of only 52 babies with Accutane-caused deformities, according to
the Times.
   Officials believe that many women and their doctors did not
always recognize the link between the drug and deformities in
babies.
   Accutane carries a strong warning label and the company has
conducted extensive campaigns to publicize its risk of causing
birth defects.
   Dr. Robert Stern, a dermatologist at the Harvard Medical School,
agreed the situation ``is a serious problem,'' but he said Accutane
is the only treatment available for many patients with disfiguring
acne.
   ``Accutane is an extremely important drug,'' he told the Times.
He stressed that severe acne, left uncontrolled, ``scars patients
both physically and psychologically.''

   The political spotlight shines briefly in
state after state before the candidates _ and the attention _ move
on. Left behind are supporters who continue the lonely fight for
delegates in sometimes long, drawn-out selection processes.
   Fifteen states are still involved in multi-step caucuses and
conventions to select delegates to the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, July 18-21.
   Idaho and Kansas, Michigan and Minnesota, Washington and
Wyoming, Nevada, South Dakota and the Virgin Islands may be ancient
political history to some, but for the Democratic hopefuls these
and other caucus states hold 599 of the 2,081 delegates needed to
nominate.
   And in some states, the possibility exists for candidates to
improve on delegate totals as the caucus system proceeds.
   In South Carolina and North Dakota, the three-step process ended
this past weekend with state conventions. Changing political
fortunes enabled Dukakis to pick up seven delegates in South
Carolina after early precinct results projected none for the
Massachusetts governor.
   Jackson finished with 28 and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. got
eight.
   In other caucus states, the campaigns are renewing their efforts
as the large number of precinct delegates decide whom they will
vote for at congressional district and state conventions.
   ``In the states where there's a big uncommitted bloc at the tier
lower than the CD (congressional district) level ... we have an
equal opportunity,'' said Susan Brophy, a delegate counter for the
Dukakis campaign.
   In Iowa back on Feb. 8, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt was the
winner in the precinct caucuses with Illinois Sen. Paul Simon
second and Dukakis third. Based on those results, Gephardt had
enough precinct delegates to assure him of 20 national delegates.
Gephardt has since withdrawn, and Simon, who was in line for 17
delegates, has suspended campaigning though he wants to keep his
delegates. Dukakis had enough support for 17 national delegates.
   As the May 14 district conventions near, when Iowans will pick
``real, live, breathing national delegates,'' in the words of Iowa
Democratic Party communications director Phil Roeder, the campaigns
are focusing on the uncommitted, Simon and Gephardt delegates to
the district conventions.
   ``There's been some movement toward Dukakis, but not
wholesale,'' Roeder said. ``The Gephardt and Simon people want to
see what happens, or at least at the state convention (June 25)
have some strength to get people elected.
   ``So much attention is placed on being first,'' Roeder said.
``But Iowa is the longest, spread out over five months. You have to
see it from beginning to end. ... No decision is set in stone.''
   The Jackson campaign has used its local volunteers in an effort
to pick up Iowa delegates, while the Dukakis forces re-opened their
Iowa office and have a staffer preparing for the conventions,
according to Roeder.
   Their work, however, may be overshadowed by this week's primary
results in New York and results from approaching primaries, which
could sway delegates before the district conventions. ``This is a
critical time,'' Roeder said.
   Other states with long selection processes include Alaska,
Colorado and Hawaii.
   In Maine, which held local caucuses on Feb. 28, Dukakis emerged
with 10 delegates and Jackson eight, but a large bloc remained
uncommitted. The candidates, looking toward the state's May 13-15
state convention, see the uncommitted numbers as fertile territory
for padding their totals.
   ``Both Dukakis and Jackson have made a concentrated effort,''
said Frederick Barton, chairman of the state Democratic Party.
``They're trying to build on their numbers. Jackson had a meeting
in Bangor with over 100 people. ... Whoever does the job over the
next three weeks will reap the benefits.''
   The party itself is enjoying the fruits of the candidates' labor
as close to 3,000 people are expected at the state convention in
Portland. ``It will be the largest ever, due in large part to this
issue,'' Barton said.
   Party leaders in Kansas, where congressional district
conventions will be held Saturday, see Dukakis and Jackson
delegates holding solid, but expect some movement among the
uncommitted and Gore delegates.
   ``Things do change between March 19 and April 23,'' said Jim
Parrish, Kansas Democratic Party chairman.

<HEAD>Team Says It Snubbed Tobacco Company Sponsorship; Wins Doctors'
Support</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctors' anti-smoking group has decided to
sponsor the U.S. boomerang team after the team said it turned down
a deal for TV coverage and $15,000 in support from the Philip
Morris tobacco company.
   Alan Blum, chairman and founder of Doctors Ought to Care, or
DOC, says the group wants to underscore dangers of tobacco company
sponsorship of sports, especially the recruiting of new smokers
among youthful sports fans.
   ``By putting the athletes out there with a no-smoking image
we're going to make the point in a cost-effective way with kids
around the world,'' Blum said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   The nation's two largest tobacco companies, Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds, sponsor a wide range of sporting events. Philip
Morris has the Virginia Slims tennis tournament and supports auto
racing and soccer in connection with Marlboro cigarettes. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco supports auto races with its Camel and Winston
cigarettes and golf tournaments with Vantage cigarettes.
   Such efforts, Blum said, are telling youth that ``being a tennis
player or a soccer player goes hand-in-hand with being a Marlboro
man.''
   Philip Morris disputed the team's version of events. ``We
rejected them,'' said Steven Weiss, the company's manager of media
relations. ``They had no opportunity to reject us. As soon as we
found out that some members of the team had concerns about being
sponsored by a tobacco company, we decided not to pursue the
sponsorship idea any further.''
   About Blum, Weiss said, ``In his usual frothing-at-the-mouth
hysteria, he's trying to create a large situation out of something
that's really minor and meaningless.''
   ``We're trying to do something,'' said Blum. ``We're trying to
spark the outrage that's needed and get rid of tobacco and sports
once and for all.''
   DOC opposes the promotion of alcohol and tobacco and tries to
educate the public to the dangers of drug abuse.
   The boomerang team is trying to raise the $12,000 the U.S.
boomerang team needs to go to Australia for the World Cup of
Boomerang Competition May 6-15 in Barooga, New South Wales.
   Chet Snouffer, a gymnastics instructor in Delaware, Ohio, and
captain of the team, said the Philip Morris deal would have
required team members to, among other things, wear the Philip
Morris logo on national television.
   ``The decision was made to forego said money and take a stance
for boomerangs as a positive health promotion, and not linked to a
tobacco company,'' Snouffer said in a statement.
   In addition to Snouffer, who took first place at the boomerang
world championships in Paris in 1985, the U.S. team is made up of
Eric Darnell of South Strafford, Vt., who finished second in Paris,
and Barnaby Ruhe of New York.
   When the idea of Philip Morris sponsorship was raised, Darnell,
who has asthma and is strongly opposed to smoking, refused to don
the tobacco company logo. ``I offered to withdraw from the team,''
he said. The team decided, instead, to reject the Philip Morris
offer, Darnell said.
   Blum and DOC have raised $2,000 so far, and small contributions
from individuals are trickling in, Blum said. That leaves the team
$10,000 short, however, with scarcely more than a week before their
May 1 departure.
   ``We're looking for individuals or others to pick that up, or
else we're going to have to pay it out of our own pockets,''
Snouffer said in a telephone interview. ``But we've kind of set a
precedent.''
   ``I think they shot themselves in the foot,'' says the agent who
had arranged the Philip Morris deal, Peter Sawyer of the Fifi
Oscard Agency in New York City. ``If Philip Morris wanted to get
behind the sport, you're talking about making boomerangs into
Frisbees. I don't know whether that was in their marketing plans,
but if the sport caught on they could have adopted it.''

<HEAD>Autopsy Shows Stevens Quit Taking Insulin Voluntarily</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALESBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man whose mummified body was tended by
his widow for eight years as if he were alive was a diabetic who
died because he stopped taking insulin, authorities said Thursday.
   The body of Carl L. Stevens, who was 40 when he died in 1979,
was found at his rural Knoxville home Jan. 29.
   In a statement, Knox County Sheriff Mark Shearer said the
autopsy found that Stevens died of ``metabolic and electrolyte
imbalance due to diabetes.''
   ``The history indicates the deceased voluntarily withheld his
insulin treatments prior to death,'' Dr. L. W. Blum, the forensic
pathologist who performed the atuopsy, said in the report issued by
the sheriff.
   Neither Blum nor Shearer was available for comment Thursday.
Shearer did not return a message, and there was no answer at Blum's
office.
   Carole Stevens had tended her husband's corpse with the help of
her two children and a houseguest, Richard G. Kunce, a former
Aurora dentist.
   A registered nurse, she bathed the corpse regularly and kept it
clothed and in a bed, authorities said.
   In February, Mrs. Stevens and Kunce pleaded guilty to failing to
report the death. Mrs. Stevens also pleaded guilty to forgery for
fabricating a power of attorney for her dead husband and using it
refinance a mortage.
   She was placed on probation. Kunce is awaiting sentencing.

<HEAD>$4.6 Billion Star Wars Budget Endorsed by Senate Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's Star Wars missile defense
system has fared better in early-round budget votes in the Senate
than in the House.
   A Senate subcommittee meeting behind closed doors voted late
Thursday to authorize $4.6 billion in the next fiscal year for Star
Wars, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The decision by the subcommittee on strategic weapons and
nuclear deterrence came as the Senate Armed Services Committee
began writing its version of the $299 billion bill providing for
the Pentagon budget during the 12 months which begin Oct. 1.
   Reagan had originally sought $4.8 billion for the program, known
formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Next week, the full House will begin considering its version of
the Pentagon budget bill, which includes $4 billion for Star Wars.
The current SDI budget is $3.9 billion.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House panel, said he
expects the House eventually to grant about $4 billion for Star
Wars, despite attempts by conservatives to raise the figure and
liberals to cut it.
   Differences between the bills which eventually emerge from each
chamber will have to be reconciled by a House-Senate conference
committee.
   Both measures provide a total of $299 billion, a figure that was
already known before the long congressional budget process started
three months ago. The total was agreed upon last December by Reagan
and congressional negotiators as they put together a plan aimed at
reducing federal budget deficits.
   The Senate subcommittee also generally granted administration
requests for the Midgetman and MX missiles, the sources said.
   Reagan had wanted $200 million for research into the
single-warhead Midgetman and $800 million for research into basing
the 10-warhead MX weapon aboard trains on western military
reservations.
   By contrast, the House measure also raises spending on the
Midgetman to $500 million, while reducing the MX request to $500
million.
   The Midgetman is a single-warhead missile backed by
congressional Democrats but opposed by the Pentagon. Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said he wanted to eliminate the
Midgetman program entirely, but agreed to include $200 million at
the request of Congress to keep the program alive until Reagan's
successor can make a decision about its fate.

   Pete Ampatzis is a businessman with
conservative views who twice voted for Ronald Reagan. But when it
came to supporting Democrat Michael Dukakis for president, he never
hesitated.
   ``Dukakis, he's got the guts. I believe Dukakis is a strong man,
better than (Vice President George) Bush,'' said Ampatzis, who came
to this country in 1969 from Greece.
   The Massachusetts governor is the son of Greek immigrants and
has attracted strong loyalty in Philadelphia's small but proud
Greek community as Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary approaches.
   Ampatzis, 52, who owns two downtown restaurants, sent to New
York for Dukakis bumper stickers even before the Massachusetts
governor opened a campaign office here.
   Those stickers adorn his delivery trucks, and a sign in a front
window at his restaurant lists the names of delegate candidates who
are pledged to Dukakis.
   ``This shows we are something,'' he said. ``It makes Greeks more
American. People say `You are an immigrant.' They look down on you.
This shows we are part of this country. I feel very proud.''
   His friend, Nicholas Savvas of suburban Havertown, remembers
discrimination from the 1950s.
   ``People called us dishwashers,'' he said. He especially likes
the way Dukakis shows pride in his heritage.
   ``Everywhere he goes he says `I am Greek-American.' That makes
every Greek-American feel good.''
   Support from the Greek community has been important since the
early days when Dukakis set off on his quest for the Democratic
nomination for president, says press secretary Mark Gearan.
   ``They were crucial in terms of initial support to the
campaign,'' Gearan said. ``I can generally say the Greek-American
community has been extraordinarily generous.''
   ``People put $10, $15 in an envelope and mail it to Dukakis,''
said Ampatzis. ``Like the ancient Greeks said: If you don't
participate, you have nothing.''
   Pete's Famous Pizza Shop contributes in another way,
occasionally sending over a few pizzas for the volunteers at
Dukakis headquarters.
   ``Many of these volunteers are students, with no money,'' he
said with a shrug. ``We have to support them. Many other
restaurants are doing the same thing.''
   Ethnic group voting is a hallowed practice in American politics.
It is why blacks are voting for Jesse Jackson by margins like 95
percent over his white rivals. It is why Frank Rizzo won 94 percent
of the Italian-American vote over his rivals in the 1983 Democratic
mayoral primary.
   ``If you don't know where a candidate stands,'' said former city
controller Joseph Vignola, ``you can figure that a candidate who
shares your ethnic heritage is going to be more in line with your
thinking, share your concerns. It's perfectly natural.''
   Ampatzis believes Dukakis will win the support of an even larger
ethnic group in Philadelphia _ the Italians.
   ``All the Greeks voted for Rizzo,'' he said. ``We're like
brothers, the Italians and the Greeks. Look back at our history.
The Italians will be for Dukakis 100 percent.''
   City Councilman James Tayoun, a Lebanese-American whose district
includes large numbers of Italian voters, agrees.
   ``Anybody whose name has got a little life to it will do well
down here,'' he said. ``Dukakis is that kind of name.''
   But Rizzo, now campaign manager for Republican candidate George
Bush, does not believe the Dukakis ethnic appeal will be strong
enough.
   Dukakis has been criticized in some quarters for being too bland
and non-controversial, but Rizzo told the Philadelphia Daily News
that, ``As far as I'm concerned, he's a radical.''
   ``His positions are just not the positions of the ethnics that I
was born and raised with,'' Rizzo said.
   Savvas insists that he isn't supporting Dukakis just because of
their shared heritage.
   ``He is a good man,'' he said. ``He comes from a good family.
He's got a very good program.''
   Still, neither he nor Ampatzis can think of a single
Greek-American they know who would support another candidate.
   ``I don't think any Greek-American would say that, except for
someone who was really mixed up in Republican politics,'' Savvas
said. ``And when those people get in the voting booth, they will be
for Dukakis.''

   The payload bay of the space shuttle
Discovery will include a 2-pound book with 16,000 signatures _ the
names of the entire Kennedy Space Center work force _ when it goes
into orbit.
   ``This is a great idea,'' said space center director Forrest
McCartney, who was the first to sign the book Thursday. ``If you
think enough of something to sign your name on it, you think enough
of it to make it go.''
   Credit for the idea goes to John Archibald, a management systems
analyst with Lockheed Space Operations Co., primary shuttle
contractor at Kennedy.
   ``I went over to see the astronauts when they were here, and
(Discovery commander) Rick Hauck mentioned that he wished we could
all be with them, that they could take everyone along with them on
the flight,'' Archibald, 41, said this week. ``And I thought, well,
we can't go physically, but the next most personal thing anybody
has is their signature,'' he said.
   Archibald, a 10-year Lockheed employee, submitted his idea as
part of the company's employee suggestion program. The company
forwarded the suggestion to Johnson Space Center in Houston, where
it got final approval.

<TEXT>
   A man who was inspired by the deadly 1980 MGM
Grand Hotel fire in Las Vegas, Nev., to invent a portable smoke
alarm has won a $3.32 million judgment against companies that
marketed a similar device.
   The federal court verdict Wednesday protects Oregon resident
Fred Stilwell's contractual rights to SleepSafe, which straps over
a hotel room door and is designed to sound an alarm and shine a
light when smoke is detected.
   Stilwell survived a fire in his home before the Las Vegas blaze
that left 84 people dead. He checked out of the MGM Grand three
days earlier.
   ``That's what tripped it off,'' Stillwell said Wednesday. ``I
registered my idea within two days of the MGM fire. I didn't even
go to work for three days.''
   The lawsuit stemmed from Stilwell's contract with two Orange
County businessmen to help secure certification from Underwriters
Laboratories to permit the alarm to be sold at major retail stores.
   The contract then called for the companies to take over
distribution, with a percentage of the profits going to Stilwell.
   Stilwell's lawyer, Kevin Roddy, said Wing Wah Chong, a Hong Kong
corporation headed by Laurence Chen of Palos Verdes Estates, and
American Scitec, the company's American representative, never
delivered on their promises and began distributing a similar device.
   The defendants, who included John Skarman of Huntington Beach
and Roy Ludt of Costa Mesa, claimed that they had done everything
possible to obtain the UL listing but that design limitations made
it impossible.

<HEAD>Survivors, Relatives File $75 Million Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Survivors and relatives of victims of the
1986 Edmond Post Office massacre filed a $75 million lawsuit
Thursday holding the Edmond postmaster, the Police Department and
members of the National Guard reponsible.
   Postal worker Patrick Henry Sherrill shot and killed 14
co-workers and wounded six others on Aug. 20, 1986, before taking
his own life.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of 11
relatives of the victims and the six wounded, is the second to seek
damages in the massacre.
   The suit alleges that Dale Fowlkes, postmaster at Edmond at the
time, authorized putting pressure on Sherrill in hopes of forcing
his resignation and should have known that Sherrill was unstable.
   Fowlkes, who retired from the Postal Service on March 13, said
Thursday he was in charge of 125 people and ``I didn't know them
that well.''
   The suit also faulted the Edmond Police Department for not
immediately storming the post office during the shooting rampage,
which last more than an hour.
   Then-Police Chief Clent Dedek, now Oklahoma's public safety
commissioner, said Thursday he had not seen the suit and declined
comment.
   National Guard officials _ one of them an unidentified
marksmanship coordinator _ were accused of failing to investigate
Sherrill's background before giving him access to guns and
ammunition.
   The suit alleged that the coordinator should have discovered
that Sherrill had threatened to kill a weapons instructor.
   Sherrill was a Guard marksmen authorized to check out pistols
and ammunition. The Guard said the two .45-caliber handguns
Sherrill carried into the post office had been issued to him for
practice and a competition.
   In December, the family of Jerry R. Pyle, who was killed in the
attack, sued the National Guard, the city of Edmond and Sherrill's
estate in state court seeking unspecified damages. That case has
not gone to trial.

   When Gloria Ahern arrived at her daughter's
home about a week ago, she found an empty house, strangers at the
door and family mementos in the trash.
   The house, she learned, had been hurriedly sold, and her
pregnant daughter, her son-in-law and grandchild had vanished.
   A few days later, she said, her 35-year-old daughter called to
say, ```Hi, Mommy. We're in South Carolina praising the Lord.'''
   ``I said, `Linda, you're sick. Please come home.' And with that
she hung up.''
   Mrs. Ahern, of suburban Broomall, is among a group of 40 people
in the Delaware Valley who believe their children have fallen prey
to a Christian cult inspired by a southern radio evangelist called
Brother R.G. Stair.
   She said Stair's broadcast predictions of nuclear holocaust
induced her children to sell their belongings for a song and seek
shelter at his organization's farm in Walterboro, S.C.
   Under his command or the dictates of his agents, his followers
have abandoned their families and friends, signed over their funds
and upended their lives, other parents said.
   ``That's ridiculous,'' said Stair, a 54-year-old self-proclaimed
prophet, from his 74-acre farm on Thursday. ``There is no power
that I have that compels people to do anything. I'm like a doctor
or a lawyer. I can give my opinion, I can tell them what's best for
them, and that's as far as I can go.''
   ``They have been under mind control, absolutely that's what it
is, for months on end,'' Mrs. Ahern insisted. ``They were like
puppets on a string. If they were told to do something they did
it.''
   Mary Del Guidice, also of Broomall, said she has put a lien on
her daughter's house to try to stop her from leaving town.
   ``They think the world is going to end, we are all going to die
and go to hell, except his people who go down south. There they are
going to be safe,'' she said.
   The parents have sought support from two area pastors and the
Cult Awareness Network, a national non-profit group based in
Chicago. The president of the Philadelphia afflilate, Marjorie
Patton, said Stair's organization has all the characteristics of a
cult, and she compared him to Jim Jones, whose followers committed
mass suicide in Guyana.
   ``It's very important to recognize that the potential for
tragedy is quite high,'' she said. ``When a leader has that much
control over people, then you know they can gain more control.''
   Stair, originally from Bethlehem, Pa., said the comparison was
baseless. He said his 40 followers voluntarily chose a Christian
life of self-denial in the country ``where the cost of living is
cheaper.''
   Law enforcement officials say they have found no illegalities in
the cult's practices.
   ``Everybody that we've talked to who is associated with this
religion is doing it of their own free will, and he (Stair) hasn't
threatened anybody,'' said Greg Auld, FBI agent in suburban Newtown
Square. ``They are freely giving over their possessions to the
community.''
   The three families who arrived from the Delaware Valley and the
other followers are free to come and go, free to receive visitors
and manage their funds in their own accounts, he said.
   Together they believe that the economy will collapse in May;
that President Reagan will not complete his term; and that nuclear
war will envelop the world before the year is out, he said.
   Chuck Rose, a self-described Christian counselor from Broomall
now at the farm, said he has promoted Stair's teachings in the
Delaware Valley for more than a year, although he first met Stair
only within the last six months.
   Rose said he announced his plan to join Stair, but exerted no
pressure upon the nine families who comprised his congregation.
   Mrs. Ahern's daughter, Linda McCourt, did not return telephone
calls to the farm on Thursday.

   A lawyer who helped defend Francis Gary
Powers, the U-2 spy pilot downed over the Soviet Union in 1960, was
convicted in federal court Thursday of plotting to smuggle drugs
and launder money.
   The jury deliberated five hours before returning the verdict
against Carl McAfee, 58, of Norton. McAfee faces automatic loss of
his law license and could receive up to 17{ years in prison. No
sentencing date was set.
   Nearly three decades ago McAfee was retained by Powers' father
to help with the pilot's defense in the Soviet Union, where he was
afforded a Soviet attorney at his espionage trial. Powers was
convicted and then swapped for a Soviet agent.
   McAfee on Thursday was convicted of plotting to import marijuana
or cocaine with Olga Thrasher, the 31-year-old wife of a marijuana
smuggler, and helping her launder drug money by advising her to
purchase cashier's checks in small amounts.
   He was also charged with trying to block an investigation of
Mrs. Thrasher's husband, Wallace, who disappeared shorly after his
marijuana-laden plane crashed into Fancy Gap Mountain in 1984,
authorities said.
   McAfee testified that he was only looking out for Mrs.
Thrasher's interests as a client.
   Defense attorney S.D. Roberts Moore said he will appeal.
   Mrs. Thrasher had testified against McAfee. She had accepted a
plea bargain in the case and received three years' probation.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III did not
remove himself from government decisions involving the wealthy
Bender family that supplies his wife's salary until a news report
disclosed that a Bender partnership had won a $50 million lease for
Justice Department offices, Meese's spokesman says.
   Responding to questions Thursday, Justice Department spokesman
Terry Eastland said Meese ``indicated to me that as of his first
hearing about any matter of the department that might involve the
Benders, he has recused himself.''
   Eastland said Meese first learned of that relationship when he
read an April 13 Associated Press story on the Justice Department's
$50 million lease in 1987 with the Bender partnership. Eastland
said he did not know whether Meese had put his recusal decision in
a written memo to aides.
   Meese's recusal came one week after Bender family members signed
a separate, $1.1-million deal to provide additional offices for the
Justice Department, government records show.
   That is the second major lease involving the Bender family and
the Justice Department since the family foundation began funding
Ursula Meese's job in January 1986.
   Meese and the Justice Department officials say he played no role
in either lease and there was no connection between the deals and
Ursula Meese's salary.
   Mrs. Meese's $40,000-a-year salary at the Multiple Sclerosis
Society is paid by a grant from the Bender Foundation, the family's
tax-exempt philanthropy, according to MS attorney James Bierbower.
   Recusal is a common way government officials and private lawyers
avoid conflicts of interest, or the appearance of them, by removing
themselves from decisions in which they may appear to benefit
financially.
   Donald Campbell, general counsel of the Office of Government
Ethics, said in an interview that recusal is the ``safer, prudent''
step for any Cabinet official who learns of a connection like the
one involving the Meeses and Benders.
   New York University law professor Stephen Gillers, an expert on
legal ethics, said in an interview that ``it's a little late'' for
Meese to recuse himself.
   ``Frankly, once she got the job, it was his job to inquire about
the source of funds. ... As soon as he knew the Benders were the
source directly or indirectly of Mrs. Meese's salary, he should
have sent around (a) screening memorandum'' telling subordinates he
would take no part in Bender-related decisions.
   Independent Counsel James McKay is investigating Mrs. Meese's
salary and the Bender family's real estate dealings with the
Justice Department as part of his inquiry into whether Meese has
any criminal conflicts of interest. Mrs. Meese appeared before
McKay's grand jury Thursday.
   The Benders, two of whom have appeared before the grand jury,
have refused to comment as has their attorney, Seymour Glanzer.
   The Bender family has large real estate holdings in Washington.
The family has built U.S. government buildings, including FBI
headquarters, and has leased several offices to the government.
   The Bender family's role in paying Mrs. Meese's salary was
publicly disclosed in The Washington Post on March 30.
   On April 8, the General Services Administration, the government
housekeeping agency, signed a two-year lease for $694,236 coupled
with a $430,000 renovation contract with Blake Development Co. and
Blake Construction Co., respectively.
   Blake Construction Co. is a Bender family firm. Blake
Development is a partnership which includes three members of the
Bender family, Blake Construction and five other persons.
   When The Associated Press first asked the GSA on April 5-6 for
all Bender or Blake leases with Justice, this lease was not
disclosed because negotiations were not final, GSA spokesman Dale
Bruce said. It was provided April 20 after The AP called back and
specifically requested it based on information developed elsewhere.
   The lease covers 12,522 square feet on the fourth floor of The
Blake Building, three blocks from the White House. Justice
Department spokesman Brad Marman said the space will be used by
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh as a secure location for defense
attorneys in the Iran-Contra conspiracy trial to review classified
government documents.
   ``Blake was the only bidder who could meet our needs for space
in the time frame we required,'' Marman said. The government wanted
to move in May 1.
   The standard government contract was amended to include a
special rider requiring Blake to monitor asbestos insulation in the
building to avoid employee exposure to cancer-causing, breathable
fibers. The GSA regularly tries to avoid leasing buildings with
asbestos problems.
   ``This lease did not come to Meese's attention as far as Justice
Management Division knows,'' Marman said. ``Blake came to our
attention through the normal competitive bidding process of the
GSA. We did not actively solicit anyone by name.''
   Robert W. Goodman, the GSA contracting officer who signed the
lease, said Blake submitted one of only two bids, both of which
came from four companies solicited to bid.
   GSA learned of the Blake space from the Fred Ezra Co., a
commercial real estate broker, Goodman said.
   At the Ezra firm, broker Richard Rome said his firm was brought
into the search by the Justice Management Division. Rome said
Justice officials had nothing to do with his locating the Blake
space. ``It was totally by coincidence that it was a Blake
building,'' Rome said.
   Marman confirmed that Justice called in the Ezra firm after its
own officials were unable to find appropriate space. He said of the
Blake location: ``With very little problem, it met our
requirements.''
   The Associated Press disclosed April 13 that a Bender
partnership had purchased a building housing Justice's Immigration
and Naturalization Service in 1985 as the government planned to
begin moving out. That move was canceled after the purchase, and
the Bender partnership later signed a $50 million, 10-year lease
renewal. The government lease enabled the partnership to sell the
building in 1987 for $22.6 million more than it cost, the new owner
said.

   Here are highlights of the sweeping trade bill
approved Thursday by the House:
   _Authorizes the president to reach international trade
agreements and guarantees them speeded up consideration with
amendments ruled out.
   _Transfers from the president to the U.S. trade representative
authority to retaliate against international trade violations and
other unfair practices.
   _Calls for mandatory retaliation but allows waivers if U.S.
rights remain intact, national security is threatened or in certain
other cases.
   _Streamlines procedures for imposing import curbs to aid
American industries threatened by surges in foreign competition and
offset foreign export subsidies.
   _Tightens law against trading partners dumping goods _ selling
their goods overseas at prices below those in their domestic market.
   _Requires speeded up and expanded benefits for those left
jobless under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program aimed at
industries in which plants have closed because of stepped up import
competition.
   _Calls for a 0.15 percent import fee to finance benefits under
the Trade Adjustment Assistance program.
   _Extends Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits to oil industry
workers, retroactive to Sept. 30, 1985.
   _Repeals the tax on windfall oil-company profits.
   _Requires all but the smallest businesses to give employees
60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   _Calls for trade sanctions against Toshiba Corp. and one of its
subsidiaries for the subsidiary's sale of submarine-silencing
equipment to the Soviets; also applies to the Norwegian company,
Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk, which participated in the sale.
   _Eases some provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
ending U.S. criminal liability in certain cases for payments to
officials overseas; tightens penalties for violation.
   _Relaxes restrictions on overseas shipment of high-tech
equipment that could have military uses to a number of Western
countries and Japan and decontrols export of low-tech equipment.
   _Strengthens law against foreign pirating of U.S. intellectual
property, such as copyrighted computer programs.
   _Increases by $1.5 billion to a total of $2.5 billion the Export
Enhancement Program under which exporters are paid in government
surplus crops to ship American grain and other farm products
overseas.
   _Authorizes an estimated $500 million in additional payments to
wheat, feed grains and oilseed crop producers unless significant
progress is reached under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade by January 1990 in phasing out farm subsidies worldwide.
   _Requires the secretary of the treasury to move toward
establishing an international debt management authority that would
purchase the debt of Third World countries that are now burdened
with crushing debt.
   _Empowers the president to halt any acquisition, merger or
takeover of an American firm by a foreign company if that action
would jeopardize national security.
   _Bans government procurement of goods produced in countries that
refuse to end violations of international trade agreements or
freeze American exports out of their markets.

<TEXT>
   A tax credit for all families with preschool
children and a massive $2.5 billion day care expansion are emerging
as the key issues in a congressional debate on how to ease the
nation's child care problems.
   Education Secretary William Bennett said Thursday that the
Reagan administration opposes the $2.5 billion Act for Better Child
Care. But he said the tax credit proposal meets the
administration's standards for a child care policy and he
personally favors it.
   Bennett told members of the House Education and Labor
subcommittee on human resources he didn't know whether the
administration would offer its own child care tax credit plan or
support other federal initiatives to help make care more affordable
and available.
   ``I couldn't tell you,'' he said. ``It's a matter of debate and
discussion within the administration right now.''
   Three approaches were discussed at the hearing: the ABC bill
backed by Democratic leaders and scores of groups representing
women, children, labor, churches and medical personnel; a tax
credit bill sponsored by Rep. Clyde Holloway, R-La.; and a
middle-ground proposal introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and
Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
   The Holloway bill would give all families a credit of $150 to
$400 per preschool child, whether the children were cared for at
home or elsewhere. Total cost: $800 million. The government already
is spending $3.7 billion on a dependent care tax credit available
to families with children in day care, Holloway said.
   Bennett said any child care policy endorsed by the
administration would have to strengthen the family, treat
stay-at-home mothers fairly, not promote any particular type of
care, target funds to those most in need and help people without
setting up a new bureaucracy.
   He said the Holloway approach meets all those tests.
   The tax credit concept also appears to sidestep church-state
problems cited by the American Civil Liberties Union, which is in
an odd alliance with conservatives in opposing the ABC bill.
   The ACLU objections center on the possibility that
religious-sponsored day care programs would qualify for ABC grants
and parent subsidies. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Dale Kildee,
D-Mich., said he is working on changes to make sure churches are
eligible, while the ACLU says the bill even as introduced violates
the separation of church and state.
   ``This is one big new federal trough for churches,'' said Barry
Lynn, legislative counsel to the ACLU. ``Too many of them want it
and they're not willing to recognize the serious constitutional
issues here.''
   Three-quarters of the ABC money would help pay the child care
bills in families making up to 115 percent of a state's median
income. The rest would go for training and salaries for child care
workers, renovation of facilities and referral programs for
parents. A national advisory panel would develop minimum federal
child care standards.
   Supporters of the bill say the federal government must play the
lead role in helping to expand day care services, ensure their
quality and make them more affordable to American families.
   But conservatives including Phyllis Schlafly complained Thursday
that the ABC bill is too expensive and cumbersome, promotes
institutional care and discriminates against parents who stay at
home with their children. And they said the income cutoff in the
bill would let some families earning $40,000 get financial help.
   The Hatch-Johnson Child Care Services Improvement Act would give
states $250 million in grant money for day care expansion and
scholarships and $100 million to start risk pools to limit provider
liability. Another $25 million would be available to help home
providers meet state licensing requirements.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of
Manufacturers have endorsed positions similar to the Hatch-Johnson
approach.

<HEAD>Some Commonly Asked Questions About Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are the answers to frequently asked
questions about the airline smoking ban that goes into effect at
12:01 a.m. Saturday.
   Q: What flights are covered by the ban?
   A: Those that are scheduled, according to the Official Airline
Guide, as lasting two hours or less. Charter flights and
international flights and any flight by a foreign airline are
exempt.
   Q: How many flights will be affected.
   A: About 80 percent of the roughly 17,300 daily domestic flights
by the major airlines. Smoking already has been prohibited on
commuter flights when the aircraft have 30 or fewer seats.
   Q: What if the flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and
takes longer than two hours.
   A: The no-smoking ban still will apply as long as the scheduled
time of the flight is two hours or less.
   Q: For the purposes of the smoking ban, what is considered a
flight?
   A: A flight is any single segment between two cities. On a
Washington-Los Angeles flight with a stop in St. Louis, for
example, the ban would apply to the Washington-St. Louis segment
that is less than two hours, but not to the St. Louis-Los Angeles
segment, which exceeds two hours.
   Q: How do I determine whether a flight is two hours or less?
   A: Check the airline schedule or ask the travel agent to give
you the scheduled departure and arrival times of each flight
segment to determine the duration of the flight. Take note that the
departure and arrival will be in local time and any change in time
zones must be taken into account.
   Q: Who enforces the smoking ban?
   A: Normally a flight attendant will advise a passenger to stop
smoking. If that does not work, the passenger will be asked to
provide his or her name and address, which will be forwarded to the
Federal Aviation Administration for enforcement action. If the
passenger refuses to provide the information, he or she may be
guilty of interfering with the operation of a flight crew, a
federal crime, and may be subject to arrest upon landing.
   Q: What is the penalty for smoking on a no-smoking flight?
   A: A passenger may face a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each
offense. Tampering with a smoke detector in an aircraft lavatory
carries a $2,000 fine.
   Q: If a flight has one stop and has both a smoking and
no-smoking segment how does a traveler avoid being caught in the
wrong section of the plane during one of the segments?
   A: Travelers should ask to be seated in the appropriate section
of the aircraft at the beginning of the trip to avoid having to be
re-seated. Even if the first segment of a flight prohibits smoking,
the traveler should ask specifically to be seated in either a
smoking or no-smoking section to avoid being in the wrong section
during the second leg of the flight in which smoking is permitted.
   Q: If a traveler already holds a reservation or paid ticket for
a seat in the smoking section of a two-hour-or-less flight will he
or she be allowed to smoke after the rule goes into effect?
   A: No. Smoking still will be prohibited on that flight.
   Q: On some flights a trip between two cities may take less than
two hours in one direction, but because of headwinds or traffic
flow take more than two hours when returning. How does the smoke
rule treat this?
   A: The smoking ban does not apply to flights of more than two
hours. However, airlines are free to prohibit smoking on any flight
if they wish to maintain consistency. Some airlines have chosen to
impose a smoking ban on flights going in both direction between the
same two cities if the elapsed times are similar.
   Q: Is there a way to find a no-smoking flight on trips of more
than two hours?
   A: Airlines are free to prohibit smoking on flights of more than
two hours. So far, Northwest Airlines has decided to ban smoking on
all flights within the continental United States regardless of
duration. No other U.S. airline has done so. But a traveler could
select a combination of flight segments each of which are two hours
or less and have no-smoking flights throught a trip. This, however,
may take longer and may cost more than the most direct flights.
   Q: What if I have a ticket on a flight where smoking is
prohibit, but the flight is canceled or overbooked and the airline
reroutes me to another flight that is more than two hours long. Is
smoking permitted on the flight I take?
   A: Yes. The rule applies to whatever flight is actually taken.
When passengers are rerouted they should check on the smoking
status of the new flight and make their preferences known to the
airline beforehand.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Strikes Down Effort To Delay Opening Arctic Refuge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental groups have suffered another
defeat in their battle with the Reagan administration and the oil
industry over opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to
petroleum development.
   The latest setback came Thursday as the House Merchant Marine
subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the
environment voted 17-9 against putting off a congressional decision
on the refuge for at least two years.
   Syd Butler, a vice president of the Wilderness Society, said the
margin of the defeat means that the subcommittee and then the full
committee will probably approve a bill to allow oil rigs into the
refuge in Alaska.
   But a major proponent of such legislation, Rep. Don Young,
R-Alaska, said he wasn't as certain. ``I never count my chickens
until I've got the bones in my mouth,'' he said.
   The drilling issue is a struggle between environmentalists, who
want no development, and the administration and the oil industry,
which say the refuge contains potentially rich oil deposits needed
to offset growing U.S. dependence on imported petroleum.
   Drilling advocates won the first congressional round earlier
this year when the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
voted 11-8 for a development bill that is awaiting floor debate.
   Pending in the House subcommittee is a compromise plan by full
committee chairman Walter Jones, D-N.C., to allow phased leasing
and development of the refuge's 1.5 million-acre coastal plain.
   The activity could begin as soon as 21 months after enactment so
long as it did not significantly harm the pristine coastal plain or
its wildlife, including a caribou herd whose principal calving area
would be off-limits to rigs.
   The rejected amendment by Reps. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., and
Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., would have shelved the drilling issue
until the Interior Department spent from two to three years
drafting a national energy policy emphasizing conservation and
renewable resources.
   Lowry said that an administration decision to cut vehicle-fleet
efficiency standards would over the years waste 9 billion barrels
of oil _ the most optimistic estimate of the refuge's reserves.
   Opponents argued that putting energy policy language into the
refuge bill would kill it for this session of Congress because it
would have to be referred to an uncertain fate in the House Energy
and Commerce Committee.
   Butler said environmentalists are more optimistic about their
chances in the House Interior Committee, which also has
jurisdiction over the issue and which traditionally has been more
receptive to their desires.
   Interior's water and power resources subcommittee has
tentatively scheduled legislative hearings on the refuge question
for three days early in June.

   President Reagan is voicing fear that Senate
failure to approve a nuclear missile treaty quickly will ``put a
strain'' on his summit next month with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Answering questions from an audience in Springfield, Mass.,
Reagan also sought Thursday to lower expectations that the
superpowers will agree soon on an accord to slash their arsenals of
intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   During a speech which White House officials said would outline
some U.S. objectives at the May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow, Reagan
said relations between Washington and Moscow have reached ``a
period of realistic engagement.''
   The president said the United States has achieved some successes
in recent dealings with the Kremlin because American policy toward
the Soviet Union has placed more emphasis on preaching the gospel
of freedom around the world _ rather than merely seeking to contain
communist expansionism.
   Reagan's speech to the World Affairs Council of Western
Massachusetts was the second of its kind in recent weeks as he and
his aides prepare for the coming summit.
   Asked by a law student to describe what would happen if the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty is not ratified by the
Senate by the time the summit arrives, Reagan said, ``I think it
would be very upsetting and it would put a strain on the summit.''
   ``We hope and pray that they will (approve the pact), but the
scheduling of it has been such that I am very concerned we may have
to go without having it ratified,'' he said.
   Reagan got little comfort on that score Thursday, as Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., declared, ``I am not going
to rush to judgment.''
   Byrd said the Senate will not speed through the ratification
debate, scheduled to start May 9.
   ``We want a good treaty, that is our objective,'' the senator
said, adding that the White House-requested summit deadline for
ratification ``doesn't guide me at all.''
   Several senators have expressed concern that provisions of the
INF treaty may ban development of futuristic weapons.
   En route to Massachusetts, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said ``we'll be working with the Hill'' on this problem.
But he also said ``it would be a shame if it did not happen. We
think we can overcome any obstacles. But there are still hurdles to
be crossed.''
   In response to another question during the Springfield outing,
Reagan acknowledged that ``there's a great question'' about whether
a treaty banning up to 50 percent of long-range nuclear missiles
can be ready for signing during the Moscow summit.
   But he said that ``we don't want a fast treaty. We want a good
treaty. We have never set a deadline'' for agreement on the
strategic arms reduction pact (START).''
   In his speech, Reagan apparently sought to lower expectations
about an agreement on a START pact. He said that as part of the
U.S.-Soviet agenda, arms control is ``not sturdy enough to bear up
the whole platform of Soviet-American relations.''
   Because of this, the president said, he will focus on a variety
of issues in Moscow, including regional disputes in Afghanistan,
Nicaragua and elsewhere, as well as human rights and bilateral
relations.
   Reagan said that while much headway has been made in relations
between the superpowers, he remains wary of Moscow's intentions.
   The president said, for instance, he's not sure of the
genuineness of the Soviet agreement to withdraw from Afghanistan.
   ``Let me say here that the next few months will be no time for
complacency, no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves,'' he
said. ``The Soviets have rarely before, and not at all in more than
three decades, left a country once occupied. They have often
promised to leave, but rarely in their history, and then only under
pressure from the West, have they actually done it.''

<HEAD>Bush Closing In On Magic Number</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is closing fast on the number of
delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination and
could top that level within the next few days _ which would be even
sooner than his advisers had expected.
   According to delegate counts maintained by both the Associated
Press and the Bush campaign, the vice president seems almost
certain to have the necessary delegates by next Tuesday after the
Pennsylvania primary.
   That's a week earlier than Bush campaign officials previously
had anticiated. The campaign had not expected to reach the level
until May 3, after primaries in Ohio, Indiana and the District of
Columbia.
   ``We're in neutral as to when the date is; we'll take it when it
comes,'' said Ed Rogers, a campaign official.
   The vice president's only remaining GOP opposition is former
television evangelist Pat Robertson, who has ceased active
campaigning.
   According to the AP count, Bush had 1,058 delegates as of
Thursday while Robertson had a scant 17. Bush's own count puts him
at 1,066 right now.
   Bush could actually top the threshold before the Pennsylvania
primary, at which 78 GOP delegates will be selected.
   Minnesota Republicans were selecting 15 delegates this week. A
Nevada state GOP convention on Saturday will choose another 20.
   In addition, there currently are 45 ``loose'' delegates, ones
chosen as uncommitted or whose candidates have dropped out of the
race, leaving them free to recommit. Bush is widely expected to
pick up most of these delegates.
   ``We did gear up for May 3, and now it's coming before then,''
said a campaign official who declined to be identified by name.
``It's not as if we were planning to have a parade. But we had been
looking at some different things to do.''
   Top Bush aides met on Thursday to discuss the likelihood that
Bush would go over the top earlier than expected and to make plans
for how to greet the development, campaign sources said.
   One problem is that Pennsylvania's primary selects ``blind''
delegates _ individuals by name, without reference to which
candidate they support.
   ``I would rather err on the side of waiting than have anyone
accuse us of jumping the gun,'' said Bush campaign manager Lee
Atwater.
   However, he added, ``We feel confident we'll be right around
that number (needed to nominate) right after Pennsylvania.''
   President Reagan, who has remained nominally neutral in the race
until now, is expected to lend campaign support to Bush once the
vice president is actually over the top, campaign aides have said.
   Bush says that the timing of the Reagan assistance is not
important.
   ``There's no question of where the president is gong to be when
this election comes forward,'' he said earlier this week. ``So I
don't feel under any pressure on this.''
   Bush has had a virtual lock on the nomination since his last
major rival, Sen. Bob Dole, withdrew from the race on March 29 and
released his delegates.

<HEAD>Oscar-Winning Screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond Dead at 67</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning screenwriter I.A.L.
Diamond, who won the Academy Award in 1960 for writing ``The
Apartment,'' died Thursday of cancer. He was 67.
   Diamond, a longtime collaborator of director Billy Wilder, also
wrote such film classics as ``Some Like it Hot'' and ``Irma La
Douce.'' He died at his Beverly Hills home.
   Diamond's work with Wilder included ``Love in the Afternoon,''
``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment'' and ``The Fortune Cookie.''
   ``If I ever lost this guy, I'd feel like Abercrombie without
Fitch,'' Mr. Wilder once said.
   Paramount Studios brought Diamond to Hollywood in 1940 after he
studied at Columbia University in New York City, where he
distiguished himself by writing four consecutive student showcase
reviews.
   Born Itek Dommnici in Ungheni, Romania, on June 27, 1920,
Diamond took on the initials I.A.L. as a whim. They stood for
nothing in particular.
   Wilder said he became aware of Diamond's talent and approached
the writer's then-agent, super agent Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar. The
meeting resulted in the first of the classic Diamond-Wilder
comedies, 1957's ``Love in the Afternoon,'' starring Gary Cooper
and Audrey Hepburn.
   Lazar confirmed Thursday that the writer had cancer for several
months.
   ``He was a marvelous writer,'' Lazar said Thursday night in a
telephone interview. ``I introduced him to Billy Wilder.
   ``They collaborated for about 30 years,'' Lazar remarked, adding
that he represented Diamond for about 25 years. ``He was a very
talented man, highly respected. ... He reached his greatest success
with Wilder.''
   Comedies that Wilder and Diamond worked on had zany and
sometimes dark humor. Together, they devised the teaming of Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis in 1959's ``Some Like it Hot'' about a pair
of road musicians hiding out from crooks by masquerading as members
of an all-girl orchestra that included Marilyn Monroe in one of her
most sweetly vulnerable roles.
   The script for which Diamond won the Oscar was for ``The
Apartment,'' a cynical comedy featuring Lemmon as a ladder-climbing
clerk who rents his domicile to adulterous executives, one of whom
was after his own girl.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson is winning high marks among many
of his fellow Democrats for taking ``the high road'' in refusing to
be drawn into negative camaigning _ even while under siege from New
York Mayor Ed Koch.
   Jackson speaks frequently of party unity, accepting both his
defeats and victories with grace, and tells his rivals not to
attack one another but to focus on victory in November over the
Republicans.
   His conduct during the New York primary race fit the pattern he
has been carefully following, avoiding attacks on his rivals.
   When the New York race was over, he praised the campaign of the
winner, Michael Dukakis, and called for a ``measure of
cooperation'' as well as a ``measure of competition'' for the
remainder of the campaign.
   The behavior has been noticed among leaders of his party, where
once he was considered a divisive force.
   ``He's performed a kind of unifying and leading function
throughout the campaign,'' said William Carrick, who was manager of
Richard Gephardt's Democratic campaign before the Missouri
congressman dropped out of the race.
   ``I think Democrats all over the country are giving Jackson high
marks for his conduct during the campaign,'' he said. ``Jesse has
tried to keep to the high road. He has not been critical. It's been
a deliberate conscious effort.''
   The effort was apparent when Jackson held back from replying as
Koch, who endorsed Sen. Albert Gore Jr., tried to mix it up by
calling Jackson anti-Israel and accusing him of lying about his
actions in the aftermath of the death of his mentor, Dr. Martin
Luther King.
   When asked by reporters to respond, Jackson said, ``Some people
are making hysteria while I'm making history.''
   ``While Ed Koch was being a thug, Jesse Jackson was being a
diplomat,'' said Bob Beckel, former campaign manager for the 1984
presidential campaign of Walter Mondale. ``The art of presidential
politics has a very heavy dose of discipline, and Jackson has shown
good deal of that.''
   Beckel and Jackson adviser Ann Lewis, a prominent Democratic
insider, both said many party officials have spoken well of the new
Jackson.
   ``There's a real appreciation that he held back,'' in the face
of Koch's attacks, said Lewis.
   Beckel said many at first were suspicious of Jackson's motives,
``But I think he's made a believer out of a lot of people,'' and
convinced them he is committed to a Democratic victory.
   Lewis said Jackson told her more than a year ago that he had
decided to wage a positive campaign, after a 1984 race in which he
attacked Democratic party rules as exclusionary, alienated Jewish
voters and fought for the spotlight by traveling abroad to meet
with controversial figures including Cuba's Fidel Castro and
Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega.
   ``In his earlier years he obviously was a protester,'' said
Jackson adviser Bert Lance, former adviser to President Carter.
``This time he has grown tremendously and has grown into the
protecter of the high road.''
   In the campaign debates, Jackson has relished the role of the
conciliator while his rivals squabbled, urging them to save their
fire for the Republicans.
   While aiming at installing a Democratic administration in the
White House, Jackson also is angling to make himself a party
insider rather than the outsider he was in 1984, observers agree.
   Not only does Jackson refrain from attacking his opponents, he
regularly telephones them and has developed ``a kind of
camaraderie,'' said his campaign manager, Gerald Austin.
   He has pledged he will campaign for the Democratic ticket even
if he is not on it. Such action should help consolidate his role in
future party politics.
   Beckel said, ``I fully expect him to run for president again.''
   And Carrick commented, ``He's doing all the right things for his
future.''
   Austin noted that Jackson, at 46, is ``going to be around for a
long time.''

<HEAD>Transportation Secretary, ALPA Argue Over Safety Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley and the
union representing 40,000 airline pilots are trading sharp words
over the usefulness of the union's recently concluded postcard
safety campaign at Eastern Airlines.
   Burnley on Thursday accused the pilots of throwing around
unsubstantiated allegations that ``gum up the system'' and prevent
Federal Aviation Administration inspectors from pursuing other
serious safety problems.
   A day earlier Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots
Association, accused Burnley of unfair ``public carping'' about the
union's campaign, in which more than a thousand postcards about
alleged safety defects were sent to the FAA and members of Congress.
   The brouhaha began last weekend when Burnley said on national
television that while the FAA has been involved in various
investigations into Eastern's safety practices, the allegations
raised by the pilots had been of little help because they did not
contain enough specifics.
   Of 1,300 postcards complaining about safety problems at Eastern
only six could be substantiated by FAA authorities, Burnley said.
The Miami-based carrier is the subject of a plane-by-plane safety
review by the FAA and faces a possible $823,000 civil fine because
of past safety violations.
   ALPA president Henry Duffy accused Burnley in a letter of not
understanding the purpose of the postcard campaign.
   ``I am at a loss as to why you repeatedly engage in public
carping against the postcard campaign to the point of
mischaracterizing it and misleading the public,'' Duffy wrote
Burnley.
   During a meeting with reporters Thursday, Burnley repeated his
criticism of the ALPA effort, but said the FAA nevertheless tried
to look into each of the 1,300 complaints.
   ``It is a diversion of FAA resources and sends our people on a
wild goose chase when they could be doing serious inspections (and)
investigating claims of safety problems that are documented,'' said
Burnley. ``It is at bottom an anti-safety device.''
   ``Complaints that are groundless ... gum up the system,'' he
continued.
   ``They would serve safety better if they sent us serious
complaints,'' Burnley said of the 40,000-member pilots union.
   ALPA spokesman John Mazor said the union would have no further
comment on Burnley's remarks, referring instead to Duffy's letter
Wednesday to Burnley which the union released previously.
   In the letter, Duffy said most of the postcards about alleged
problems at Eastern were sent anonymously and lacked some details
because the pilots feared reprisals if more information were
provided.
   ``If Eastern were to agree to ... no reprisals against employees
wishing to report safety problems, your desk would be flooded with
safety reports, complete down to the most minute detail of name,
time, place and aircraft number,'' wrote Duffy.
   Burnley said the department would take action against any
airline found taking punitive action against an employee who
discloses a safety problem. Eastern management has accused the
pilots of a ``slanderous safety campaign'' and denied safety
problems at the airline.

Opportunities</HEAD>

   High-value products from soup to nuts dominate
a thriving agricultural export business with Canada, and the
Agriculture Department says there is excellent potential for
further growth.
   ``Trade between the United States and Canada is smoothed because
the two countries share a common language as well as great
similarities in customs and culture, socio-economic status,
economic structure and consumer preferences,'' says William Glynn
of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   Canada's 26 million people are the largest foreign market for
U.S. high-value products, accounting for almost 20 percent of the
total exports of U.S. those items.
   More than 85 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports to Canada
_ $1.81 billion last year _ are in the form of high-value products.
   By USDA definition, high-value products, or HVPs, are
``value-added processed products and consumer-ready products such
as nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables.''
   Glynn, in a report scheduled for the May issue of Foreign
Agriculture magazine, said horticultural and tropical products make
up the largest component of high-value trade with Canada,
accounting for nearly 62 percent of the U.S. high-value total.
   Fresh vegetables lead the list and have shown ``a slow but
steady increase over the past several decades,'' he said.
``Prospects for this trend to continue are favorable.''
   Dairy, livestock and poultry products make up the next largest
HVP category, led by undressed fur skins.
   ``High-value grain and feed products, which have posted an
annual growth rate of 8 percent since 1980, also show potential for
further growth,'' Glynn said. ``Leading product groups are
starch-inulin-gluten products; prepared breakfast food; and bread,
biscuits and cake.''
   There is a potential also for fast foods such as frozen and
microwavable products, and for foods with a short preparation time.
   ``Although the outlook for trade appears good, labeling
requirements continue to present possible constraints,'' he said.
``Canada uses the metric system, and metric weights and measures
must be stated on the labels of all prepackaged consumer products.''
   For example, sliced bacon must be marketed in 500-gram packages.
One-pound packages _ 454 grams _ are not allowed.
   ``Bilingual labeling is required for almost all consumer food
products entering Canada,'' Glynn said. ``French is one of the two
official languages in Canada and is the principal language in many
of the large urban areas of eastern Canada.''
   The new U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement ``is expected to open
the doors to wider markets on both sides of the border,'' he said.
``If the pact is approved by both nations, all tariff and some
non-tariff barriers to agricultural trade will be eliminated over
the next 10 years.''
   But Glynn said that even with the new trade pact some
constraints will exist, particularly for high-value products.
   For example, although discriminatory price markups on U.S. wines
will be eliminated, the sale of alcoholic beverages will remain
under the control of the sovereign provincial monopolies, he said.
Each of those boards has its own set of rules and regulations that
affect liquor products sold in their jurisdictions.
   Also, U.S. fresh fruits and vegetables could continue to face
seasonal restrictions because of a ``snapback'' provision in the
pact which allows either country to apply tariffs for up to 180
days a year under certain price and production conditions, Glynn
said.

   The Agriculture Department removed some of the
red tape hampering shipment of certain genetically engineered
organisms from one state to another.
   As a result, the department will allow the material to be moved
interstate between research facilities without a permit.
   James W. Glosser, acting administrator of the department's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Thursday agency
scientists found the commonly used laboratory organisms, when
properly packaged, pose no risk to people, plants, animals or the
environment.
   Shippers must still follow conditions outlined by the agency,
however, and the organisms must not contain ``genetic sequences''
that would allow them to invade or damage plants.
   The exempted laboratory microorganisms were Escherichia coli
genotype K-12 and its derivatives, sterile strains of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae or asporogenic (non-spore forming) strains of Bacillus
subtilis.
   The microorganisms being exempted are not only non-toxic but
cannot survive outside of carefully controlled laboratory
conditions, Glosser said. Therefore, in case of an accidental spill
during transport the organisms would perish and could not cause any
danger.
   Glosser said the National Institutes of Health, which
administers guidelines for genetic engineering research, also has
excluded these organisms from risk categories that require special
containment.

   There were fewer hens in the nation's
egg-laying flocks last month, but they worked harder than they did
a year ago, an Agriculture Department shows.
   Production was estimated 5.96 billion eggs in March, a 1 percent
decline from a year earlier, the report said Thursday. But the
total number of hens averaged 278 million last month, a 2 percent
decline from March 1987.
   That put March egg output at an average of 2,147 eggs per 100
layers, compared with 2,132 eggs from 100 birds a year earlier, the
report said.

   Eight in 10 American smokers believe that
``passive'' cigarette smoke is harmful, and nearly half say they've
found others' smoke to be annoying, according to a government
survey.
   Eighty-eight percent of the Americans over 16 who were
questioned in the federal government's 1986 tobacco-use surveys
said they considered smoke from the cigarettes of others to be
generally harmful to health, the national Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   The survey also found that 79 percent of all respondents _
including 43 percent of smokers _ said they were annoyed by others'
cigarette smoke.
   And 61 percent of all respondents _ including 14 percent of the
smokers _ said that, when given a choice, they sit in the
non-smoking sections of restaurants, airplanes and other public
places.
   ``These data indicate that a large percentage of smokers and
non-smokers regard (passive smoking) as a health hazard,'' the CDC
said in its report. ``In addition, a majority of non-smokers and
almost half of current smokers are annoyed. ...''
   The survey, among 13,031 people, was conducted before Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop's landmark report warning of the effects of
passive smoking was released at the end of 1986.
   If it were repeated, the awareness and distaste for passive
smoking would probably be even higher, said Dr. Thomas Novotny of
the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health, the CDC department that
conducted the survey.
   The survey's margin of sampling error is believed to be no more
than 2 percentage points, Novotny said.
   The findings were up noticeably from a poll conducted by the
Roper Organization in 1978, which found that 58 percent of
Americans believed passive smoking was hazardous, the CDC noted.
   Other findings from the government's 1986 survey:
   _82 percent of those who never smoked pick no-smoking sections
in planes and restaurants, compared with 69 percent of former
smokers.
   _75 percent of smokers said passive smoke was ``very'' or
``somewhat'' harmful, rather than ``slightly'' or not at all.
   _69 percent of those who never smoked or had quit said passive
smoking was harmful to their own health, not just in general.
   _42 percent of all working respondents said their workplaces
have restricted smoking, and 53 percent of them said they were
nonetheless still exposed to passive smoking in the workplace.

<HEAD>Lendl Wins Crucial Set In Olympic Battle For U.S. Citizenship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennis star Ivan Lendl has moved a giant step
closer to his dream of playing for the U.S. Olympic team in Seoul
this summer, winning a crucial set from a skeptical Congress.
   The House Judiciary immigration subcommittee, which last year
vowed to avoid speeding up grants of citizenship to athletes hoping
to compete in the Olympics, did just that Thursday for Lendl and
two lesser-known hopefuls.
   Lendl wants Congress to lift the mandatory five-year waiting
period immigrants with permanent resident status must go through
before receiving full citizenship. The Czech native, who lives in
Greenwich, Conn., and has adopted the United States as his home,
cannot represent the United States in the Olympics without
citizenship.
   ``Ivan Lendl deserves the opportunity to compete as a citizen of
his adopted country, and we as American citizens deserve to have
him represent us,'' Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., told the
panel. Lendl is ranked No. 1 in the world.
   Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., the subcommittee chairman,
usually opposes such bills. But he said he was sympathetic to
arguments that preventing Lendl's participation would be a ``true
hardship'' because his prime years are so limited.
   Still, Mazzoli said he was concerned that expedited citizenship
would not automatically make Lendl eligible for the U.S. team.
   Ronald T. Rowan, general counsel of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
said that under International Tennis Federation rules, a player
first must represent his country in the Davis Cup before the
Olympics.
   But federation rules also say that Lendl needs a special waiver
to play for the United States in the Davis Cup since he has
previously represented his native Czechoslovakia in those games.
The next Davis Cup is in July.
   The Olympics, which will be held in Seoul from Sept. 17 through
Oct. 2, will have tennis as a full sport for the first time since
1924. It was a trial sport in 1984. Modified Olympic rules will
allow professional tennis players such as Lendl to compete.
   The Lendl bill, which even proponents had given little chance of
passage earlier this year, was approved without opposition and sent
to the House Judiciary Committee.
   The subcommittee also approved citizenship bills for Jens-Peter
Burntd, an East German swimmer who defected in 1985 and is living
in Alabama, and Gagik Barseghian, an Armenian wrestler who moved to
California in 1986.
   Assuming it passes the House, the legislation still could face
serious obstacles in the Senate. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
Mazzoli's Senate counterpart, remains wary of Olympic exemptions.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., an avid tennis fan and fellow
Greenwich resident, is expected to lead the Senate fight.
   Lendl, 28, moved to Connecticut in 1981 and received his
permanent resident status last year. Lendl, who is at the Monte
Carlo Open, was in Washington last week to personally lobby
lawmakers.

<HEAD>New Flu Vaccine On Way After `Drift' In Viruses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``drift'' in the prevailing influenza viruses
circulating over the winter has prompted federal health officials
to recommend changes in next winter's flu vaccine.
   The U.S. Public Health Service called Thursday for an alteration
in the nation's recommended flu vaccine, to better protect against
two viruses that ``drifted,'' or began changing into different
forms in the 1987-88 flu season.
   The 1987-88 flu vaccine, as is customary, contained protection
against the three major types of flu _ which researchers know as
Type A-H3N2, Type A-H1N1, and Type B.
   Specifically, the vaccine was tailored to guard against an
A-H3N2 strain known as the Leningrad flu, an A-H1N1 strain known as
the Taiwan flu and a B strain known as the Ann Arbor flu.
   But late last year, as the winter flu season began in this
country and the vaccine was administered, U.S. Centers for Disease
Control researchers reported evidence of a ``drift'' in the A-H3N2
virus, toward a different form.
   Researchers later said they had identified four A-H3N2 strains
circulating in the United States. One of those four strains, known
as the Sichuan flu, should be included in the 1988-89 flu vaccine,
the Public Health Service recommended in Thursday's CDC weekly
report.
   Meanwhile, although Type B flu was seen less frequently than
Type A-H3N2 in the United States last winter, ``it has become
clear'' that a ``drift'' in that flu, too, has occurred. The Public
Health Service is thus recommending a different B strain, the
Victoria flu, be included in next winter's vaccine.
   For its third component, the vaccine should again include last
year's recommended A-H1N1 strain, the Taiwan flu, the CDC reported.
   CDC researchers say such variations in flu viruses are not
uncommon. The agency recommends flu vaccine particularly for older
people and those who might be prone to severe complications from
the flu.
   There are indications that the 1987-88 flu season continues to
wind down, the CDC said. Only two states _ Hawaii and New Hampshire
_ last week reported ``widespread'' outbreaks of flu-like illness,
with reports from areas containing at least half the state's
population.
   Five others _ California, Connecticut, Illinois, North Dakota
and Vermont _ reported less severe, ``regional'' outbreaks, the CDC
said.
   To gauge the effects of the flu season, CDC researchers measure
the number of deaths from pneumonia and flu in selected cities
against the standard for the time of year; that index has been
above the ``epidemic threshold'' for nine weeks, said Dr. Suzanne
Gaventa, a CDC flu specialist.

   States must provide new programs for
blue-collar workers in computer and math, broadening old notions of
literacy to ensure workers can compete in an increasingly
technological economy, says a report by the state of Michigan and
International Business Machines Corp.
   ``Economic change has redefined literacy,'' Michigan Gov.
Blanchard said Thursday at a news conference releasing the report.
   For example, he said, workers in auto plants and other factories
must be able to understand computer manuals and perform other tasks
far removed from traditional jobs such as putting a nut on a bolt.
   The report said reading and writing are no longer sufficient
skills for a worker to get a job, and it proposed programs that any
state could use to develop the math, computer and teamwork skills
of workers.
   The report also recommended creation of standard ways to assess
worker skills, coordinate training programs and make access to such
training programs easier.
   Fully 15 percent to 20 percent of adults in the United States
lack the skills needed to get and keep jobs, Blanchard said. In
Michigan, as many as 1.3 million adults lack the skills needed to
work in the new economy, he said.
   The report said 30 percent of new jobs created in Michigan by
the end of the century will require at least four years of college,
a level of education attained by only 17 percent of the workers in
the state.
   The report said 22 percent of new jobs will require from one to
three years of college, a level reached by only 20 percent of the
workers in the state.
   At the other end of the scale, the 40 percent of the workers
having only a high school education will be competing for 34
percent of the jobs, and the 16 percent that dropped out of high
school will be competing for 10 percent of the jobs.
   The Michigan plan would require little new money and would
largely draw on the $500 million a year now spent for training and
retraining, Blanchard said.

   Jesse Jackson, saying ``I always run against
great odds,'' brushed aside opinion polls indicating he trails
Democratic presidential rival Michael Dukakis in Pennsylvania,
where 178 delegates are up for grabs in Tuesday's primary.
   ``We are closer than we've ever been before and we're going all
the way,'' Jackson said Thursday from the steps of a Methodist
church here. He was campaigning in Pennsylvania again today.
   Accompanied by Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode, Jackson
toured a neighborhood known for its drug sales to spread his
trademark ``down with dope, up with hope'' message.
   ``We've got to change our minds about drugs, the No. 1 threat to
our national security,'' Jackson told a cheering crowd. ``When I
become president the drug pusher is in trouble.''
   Goode, hoarse from shouting Jackson's name as he walked
arm-in-arm with the candidate, told the crowd, ``We're here to send
Jackson to the White House and we need you to turn out and vote
next Tuesday.''
   The crowd that started at about 600 grew as Jackson neared the
church, where hundreds more waited in the street.
   The Rev. Hector Colon, pastor of the Hispanic church, opened
with a prayer: ``Believe me, Lord, we know you want Jesse in
Washington. We want him in Washington, too.''
   Despite polls that indicate he trails Dukakis here by more than
30 percentage points, Jackson insisted ``we the people are
winning'' his fight to become the party's presidential nominee.
   Jackson flew into Philadelphia after speeches at a labor rally
in Erie in western Pennsylvania and at a high school in
Williamsport in central Pennsylvania, where he also made his
anti-drug appeal.
   Jackson said he visited the high school to keep the focus of the
campaign on young people.
   ``There is no greater threat to young Americans today than
cocaine, crack, heroin and PCP,'' he told the students.
   Jackson also got an enthusiastic reception from 4,000 people in
a downtown Erie park in the afternoon.
   During his 35-minute speech, directed toward the region's
blue-collar workers and farmers, Jackson called for economic change.
   ``Profits are up, wages are down, factories are closing, and
workers are abandoned,'' he said. ``Let's rebuild America and put
the workers back to work.''

<HEAD>More Health Workers' AIDS From `Unknown' Cause; Feds Say Risk
Still Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

   The occupational hazard of AIDS in health care
workers remains small, although there are more unexplained cases
among those workers than among other Americans, government health
researchers say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
2,586 health care workers are known to be among the more than
50,000 Americans who have contracted AIDS.
   While only 2.8 percent of the nation's other AIDS patients are
classified as having gotten the disease in an ``undetermined''
manner, nearly twice as many of the health care workers with AIDS
are so characterized _ 5.3 percent, or 135 in all, the CDC said.
   Health care workers make up 5.4 percent of the known U.S. AIDS
patients and a similar percentage of the U.S. population at large _
5.7 percent.
   More than a dozen health care workers are documented to have
been infected with the virus that causes AIDS as a result of their
work _ usually by being pricked accidentally by a needle carrying
contaminated blood. One health care worker is known to have gone on
to develop the deadly disease itself after he was infected in such
a manner.
   Scientific studies in which health workers are enrolled and then
followed to assess their risk of AIDS infection have shown that the
chance of being infected after a needle-stick exposure to blood
from infected patients is less than 1 percent, the Atlanta-based
CDC said.
   ``That data has not changed at all (in continuing
studies),''said Dr. Mary Chamberland, a CDC AIDS specialist. ``The
risk is still regarded as low.''
   The reasons for the higher number of undetermined cases among
health care workers could include patients' failure to report
homosexual activity, drug use and other risk factors, or ``the
occupational risk of (AIDS) infection as a result of blood
exposure, or both,'' the CDC said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome most often strikes
homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers, and also is spread
less frequently through heterosexual contact or blood transfusions.
   The failure of AIDS patients to disclose behavior that might
have put them at risk is something researchers consider when
looking at undetermined risk, Ms. Chamberland said.
   ``Or, we may be seeing some occupational transmission in the
health care setting,'' she added. ``It's difficult to establish
with certainty how transmission occurred.''
   While most U.S. health care workers with AIDS were infected
outside their jobs, ``a small number of health-care workers have
been infected ... through occupational exposures,'' the CDC noted
in its weekly report.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, has struck 59,491
people in the United States, and has so far killed 33,280 of them,
according to statistics this week from the CDC.

   East Asia's newly-prosperous trading countries
dislike being lumped together, but growing interdependence means
they and other Pacific rim nations should organize a regional
economic framework, Congress was told.
   ``The entire Pacific region now requires a mechanism for
multilateral economic consultations (because it) ... has become one
of the most interdependent areas of the world and in the next
century will have the largest impact of any region on the global
economy,'' said Richard M. Fairbanks III, president of the U.S.
National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation.
   Fairbanks' group is an organization of U.S. government, business
and academic specialists on trade, focusing on Pacific issues.
   Pacific trade tensions are managed ``primarily by means of a
growing tangle of bilateral dialogues whose inefficiencies have
begun to work against us,'' Fairbanks said Thursday.
   Disputes between the United States and South Korea, Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Singapore _ the so-called four ``dragons'' or ``tigers'' _
show ``the region is part of a complex multilateral system in which
not all the parts are adequately communicating with one another,''
he said. All four have large trade surpluses with the United States.
   For example, South Korea, ``as a key political and military ally
of the United States, would be more willing to rapidly revalue
(appreciate) its currency and liberalize imports if it could be
more certain that such measures would benefit the U.S.'' Fairbanks
said. As it is, however, ``Korea expects Japan and the other
newly-industrialized countries would be the primary
beneficiaries,'' he said.
   Rep. Robert Garcia, chairman of the House banking, finance and
urban affairs subcommittee, asked whether more Asian representation
was warranted in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development, made up of the two dozen wealthiest industrial
countries, mostly European and North American.
   Some ``have earned a place at the table,'' replied Robert D.
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, a major
U.S.-based underwriting firm.

   The town square of Carthage, Albert Gore
Jr.'s hometown, was nearly empty _ there were just a couple of men
whittling cedar sticks. Town residents were inside watching
television as Gore bowed out of the Democratic presidential race.
   It was just 10 months ago that Gore stood on the steps of the
Smith County Courthouse and told a cheering throng gathered on that
same town square that he was running for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   A handful of the Tennessee senator's supporters gathered around
a television in Hire & Long's Furniture Store Thursday to watch the
broadcast of Gore's concession speech from Washington.
   Jerry Futrell, Smith County's single delegate to the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta in July, said he was disappointed.
   ``I felt the time was right. But obviously, it is not,'' he said.
   He and Smith County Democratic Committee chairwoman Evelyn
Fisher were in Hire and Long's to watch the speech.
   ``This today is just temporary ... we will continue to support
him,'' Ms. Fisher said. ``He'll make a great president one day.''
   Smith County Executive C.E. Hackett said most Gore backers were
pleased with his performance, although they were disappointed that
he failed to make headway outside the South.
   ``He's run a good race and we've nothing to be ashamed of at
all,'' Hackett said.
   Few doubted that Gore will be a presidential candidate in 1992.
Bonnell Ray, of Ragman Discount and Flea Market, says he will be
saving a lot of his undated ``Gore for President'' paraphernalia.
   Other items emblazoned with ``Gore In '88'' are on sale _ for $1.
   ``I guess I'll keep it out another month or so, for
collectors,'' Ray said. ``I'll bring out the rest in '92.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush and his wife,
Barbara, paid $86,684 in 1987 income taxes, slightly more than the
amount paid by President Reagan and his wife, Nancy.
   However, the Bushes paid the taxes on $36,963 less income.
   According to tax return released Wednesday, George and Barbara
Bush paid taxes equivalent to 28 percent of their total income of
$308,396. By contrast, the Reagans paid $86,638 in taxes on total
income of $345,349, or 25 percent.
   Both the president and the man who will be the 1988 Republican
presidential nominee benefited under new tax-law changes, although
Reagan clearly benefited the most.
   In 1986, the Bushes had paid taxes of $115,486 on income of
$348,594 _ or 33 percent. The Reagan's 1986 tax bill came to
$92,460 on total income of $336,649 _ or 27.5 percent.
   The bulk of Bush's income came from his $114,681 in salary plus
other reimbursements as vice president and from $169,600 from the
blind trust set up when he took office in 1981.
   This trust included $26,075 in capital gains, $31,264 in
interest and dividends and $112,261 in other income.
   Details were not disclosed under terms of the blind trust. Aides
have said previously that the trust is valued at about $1 million.
   Bush also reported $20,773 in ``passive income'' from his
interest in a liquefied natural gas barge, $1,575 in royalties on
his book, ``Looking Forward,'' and $66 in interest on his account
in the White House credit union.
   Bush's salary was up from the $97,900 he received in 1986,
reflecting a general raise in federal salaries, even though his
overall income was down.
   The main reason for the lower gross income: a much lower level
of capital gains, the income derived from the sale of assets,
property or stock.
   In 1986, Bush reported total capital gains of $430,165,
apparently reflecting a decision by the trustees of his blind trust
to sell off assets before the new tax-law changes took effect last
Jan. 1, which increased the tax on capital gains to 28 percent for
1987.
   Before then, not all capital gains were reported as income. This
resulted in a maximum total tax of 20 percent on such gains.
   Bush has made return to a lower rate of taxation on capital
gains a major campaign theme, claiming the decision to tax capital
gains at generally the same rate as other earnings stifles business
investment.
   Bush has proposed a capital gains tax of no more than 15 percent.
   The Bushes claimed total deductions for 1987 of $53,314,
including $12,225 in contributions to 35 charities. The largest
were three $1,000 gifts to the Yale Alumni Fund, the United Negro
College Fund and to the Combined Federal Campaign (United Way).
Bush graduated from Yale in 1948.
   Bush had $32,588 withheld from his salary and made an additonal
$57,000 in advance payments _ suggesting a refund of $2,904.
However, the vice president elected to have this money held and
applied to his 1988 taxes.
   Bush claimed $3,574 in business meals and entertainment and
another $6,880 in miscellaneous business deductions. He paid $700
to have the tax return prepared by a Houston accounting firm.
   The vice president has released his tax returns annually. In
addition, he released 14 years in previous returns last January
during the heat of his campaign with then-rival Sen. Bob Dole, who
has since withdrawn from the race for the GOP presidential
nomination.
   Those returns showed that 1986 was _ and still is _ his biggest
income year, and that over the 14-year period he paid taxes ranging
from 3 percent to 41 percent of his annual income.
   The Internal Revenue Service estimates that by next year, when
the tax-law changes are fully phased in, about three-quarters of
all Americans will have smaller proportional tax bills than they
had in 1986.

   President Reagan joked about books by ex-aides
and his own mental faculties, but grew serious in his farewell to
the White House press corps when he turned to his seven years of
``friction'' with the media.
   ``What I hope my epitaph will be with the White House
correspondents, what every president's epitaph should be, is `he
gave as good as he got,''' Reagan told the White House
Correspondents Association dinner on Thursday.
   ``That, I think, makes for a healthy press and a healthy
presidency,'' he said in his seventh and last appearance at the
dinner, an annual affair where reporters and public officials set
aside hostilities for a night and toast each other alongside
invited celebrities.
   Reagan, his wife, Nancy, seated beside him, also noted the furor
over recent critical books by longtime aides such as former
presidential spokesman Larry Speakes and former deputy White House
chief of staff Michael Deaver.
   ``This looks like the index to Larry Speakes book,'' said
Reagan, as he looked out over the crowd.
   Speakes had accepted an invitation to the dinner from The
Washington Post, but withdrew last week in the wake of stories
about his book.
   ``Even (White House chief of staff) Howard Baker is writing a
book. It's going to be called `Three By Five: The Measure of a
President,''' he said, referring to his use of index cards in
meetings.
   ``Mike Deaver said I have a short attention span,'' he said. ``I
was going to reply to that, but what the hell, let's move on to
something else.''
   And joking about the frequent complaints that he does not hold
enough meetings with the press, he said the presidential campaign
has left him ``feeling a little lonely.''
   ``With everyone following the presidential campaign, I've been
feeling a little bit lonely. I've been so desperate for attention,
I almost considered holding a news conference,'' Reagan said,
drawing his biggest laugh from the reporters.
   He got a more sober reaction when he noted the media criticism
of his administration.
   ``Every president will try to use the press to his best
advantage,'' he said. But ``the press is not a weak sister that
needs bracing. The press can take care of itself and a president
should be able to take care of himself as well.''
   In keeping with the cease-fire spirit of the evening, Reagan
applauded and shook hands with seven reporters who got awards for
White House coverage that included several articles about problems
in his administration in the past year.
   The reporters used the evening to issue their traditional
invitations to celebrities from motion pictures and supermarket
tabloids, causing problems when photographers shoved past members
of Congress and Cabinet members to get pictures.
   Donna Rice, a guest of The Baltimore Sun, posed quietly as
dozens of people took photographs and asked for her autograph.
Former presidential candidate Gary Hart, whose association with Ms.
Rice helped end his campaign, did not attend.
   Vanna White came with Sylvester Stallone and sat on his lap
during the dessert course.
   Fawn Hall, Lt. Col. Oliver North's secretary, was there talking
with former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane. Lawrence
Walsh, the special prosecutor of the Iran-Contra affair, sat nearby.

   Indictments against 10 men will not
repair the shattered life of a 19-year-old woman who remains in
hiding with her family since she reported being abducted and
gang-raped last month, friends say.
   ``They have to get out of San Diego,'' said Richard Yaeger, a
friend of the victim and her 23-year-old husband in this southern
Texas town of 5,000, where many residents are related. ``They'll
never be able to come back here.''
   A grand jury indicted 10 men Thursday on charges including
sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping.
   The couple and their two children, ages 16 months and four
months, have lived in a secret location in Corpus Christi since
shortly after she reported the March 26 incident, Yaeger said.
   Some of the defendants have said the victim was a willing
participant, and Yaeger said the victim and her family have
received threats for reporting the incident to authorities.
   The young mother returned to San Diego to testify before the
grand jury Thursday, and was led out of the courthouse with her
head and face covered by a black shawl.
   The woman said the four-hour series of assaults began at an
illegal cockfight at a ranch and continued at two other locations.
Bystanders ignored her pleas for help and some joined her
attackers, she said.
   Since news of the incident, however, well-wishers donated more
than $8,000 to the family, and the unemployed husband received a
job offer, said Dot Barnette of Crisis Services in Corpus Christi.
   ``I would say that the response from the community has been
fantastic, particularly with individuals,'' Ms. Barnette said.
   The 10 men who were indicted were arrested within days of the
attack, and will be re-arrested, said Rodolfo Gutierrez, a Duval
County assistant district attorney.
   Bonds for each sexual assault charge were set at $50,000; bonds
for each kidnapping charge were set at $100,000.

<HEAD>Scholars Skeptical On Reported Shakespeare Poem Find In California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN L. CALLISON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN MARINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poem by anyone other than
Shakespeare might not scan as sweet. But scholars are turning up
their noses at reports of previously unpublished verse by the Bard
in a California library.
   The poem, pasted onto the back of a manuscript volume in
Huntington Library here, was discovered in December 1986 by an
Oxford University researcher and published for the first time today
in the London newspaper The Independent.
   ``It's possible, certainly,'' said Sara Hodson, associate
curator of literary manuscripts at the library, one of the most
prestigious in the West. ``But then again, we will want to wait and
see the evidence on which the attribution is being made.''
   The researcher, Peter Levi, came across the 14-verse poem while
working on a biography of the 16th- and early 17th-century poet and
playwright, The Daily Telegraph in London reported Thursday.
   Levi brooded on his find for a year, told his British
publishers, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., and showed the verses to
colleagues, according to The Independent.
   But the report by the paper's literary editor, Sebastian Faulks,
said the decision to attribute the verses to Shakespeare was Levi's
own. It quoted him as saying: ``I have thought about these lines
for a long time and I don't see how they can not be by
Shakespeare.''
   Macmillan's chairman, Lord Stockton, told the Daily Telegraph,
``Levi has to his satisfaction and I think to the satisfaction of a
lot of other people _ and certainly to us _ authenticated this as
poetry penned by `Big Bill'.''
   However, Faulks said Levi was ``not absolutely certain'' that
Shakespeare wrote the poem.
   The 14 short verses were intended to be spoken at a betrothal
party for Anne, the eldest daughter of the Dowager Countess Alice
of Derby, The Independent said. The name of the planned speaker was
written before each verse, and Levi is believed to have used the
names as keys in his literary detective work, The New York Times
reported today.
   Macmillan said Levi will hold a news conference in London on
Monday, but declined comment on what will be revealed. Repeated
calls by The Associated Press to Levi's home in Stonesfield near
Oxford went unanswered.
   However, Stanley Wells, professor of Shakespeare studies at the
University of Birmingham, was quoted as telling the Daily Telegraph
that scholars who have examined the poem had ``little doubt that
these verses were written not by Shakespeare but by someone else.''
   Hallett Smith, senior research associate at the library, also
said it was unlikely the work was written by Shakespeare.
   Smith, who had not studied the disputed poem, said no
significant Shakespearean literary creations have ever been
uncovered apart from the main body of his work.
   Ms. Hodson added that this isn't the first time someone has
suggested that the work might have been written by Shakespeare.
   ``It has been in the library since 1917 and looked at by many
scholars in all those years,'' she said. ``At least one other
scholar and probably more have wondered about the Shakespeare
connection.''
   It is difficult to decipher the contents of the poem because it
is scrawled in poor handwriting, Ms. Hodson said. There are
initials at the bottom that could either be interpreted as ``WSH''
or ``WSK.''
   The Daily Telegraph said the poem will be published Monday in a
28-page booklet produced in secrecy by Macmillan, ``A Private
Commission: New Verse by Shakespeare, '' two days after the 424th
anniversary of Shakespeare's birth.
   In 1985, a love poem found in Oxford University's Bodleian
Library and attributed to Shakespeare by American scholar Gary
Taylor drew bad marks from other scholars, who said it could not
have been Shakespeare's work.
   Ms. Hodson said the Levi poem is written on two sheets of paper
pasted inside the back cover of a manuscript volume containing a
play by English dramatist John Marston, who lived from 1575 to 1634.
   Shakespeare lived from about 1564 to 1616.
   Neither the Marston play nor the poem attributed to Shakespeare
is marked with a date, but handwriting, paper, watermarks and the
binding have been used to date the manuscripts to the 17th century,
Ms. Hodson explained.
   The Huntington collection has 2.5 million manuscripts including
several of the most important manuscripts by Chaucer, Ms. Hodson
said.

   A mother distraught over a difficult pregnancy
``just snapped'' when she drowned her 2-month-old son in the
bathtub to stop his crying, then reported him kidnapped from his
stroller, police said.
   Lucrezia Gentile, 36, was charged with second-degree murder late
Thursday night, said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   The infant Stephen Gentile, dressed in a blue hooded snowsuit,
was found dead in a trash can Thursday after his mother broke down
during a polygraph test at FBI headquarters in Manhattan, told
detectives about her son's death and gave them the location of his
body.
   ``I put him under the water until he stopped crying,'' Mrs.
Gentile told detectives, said a police source close to the
investigation, who insisted on anonymity.
   Investigators say she drowned the infant at her Brooklyn
apartment Wednesday morning. Her husband, John Gentile, 32, also
was questioned but was cleared of any involvement in his son's
death.
   Gentile, who had retired from the Conrail police force with a
disability in 1984, had worked part-time as a guard for the U.S.
Marshal's office in Brooklyn.
   Mrs. Gentile was alone when the baby died. ``She then dressed
the baby, placed him in a white plastic bag, put him in his
stroller, walked several blocks ... and placed the baby in a green
trash can,'' said Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo during a
news conference at police headquarters Thursday.
   Initially, Mrs. Gentile had told police Stephen was taken from
his stroller by two men in a black sedan who stopped her to ask
directions as she was walking towards St. Ephram's grammar school
Wednesday morning.
   She said a woman had phoned the Gentile home to say Mrs.
Gentile's 7-year-old son, John, was ill at the school. The police
found no evidence of the call.
   Mrs. Gentile did not have a history of mental problems,
Colangelo said. There was also no indication of child abuse and no
record of reports to city agencies indicating they had been
notified of any abuse, the chief said.
   The baby ``was colicky and she had post-partum depression,''
said the police source. ``She had a difficult pregnancy, a
difficult birth, the kid was up all night and she couldn't sleep.
She just snapped,'' the source said.
   Mrs. Gentile's unhappiness with her second pregnancy, which
ended with a delivert by Caesarian section, was corroborated by
neighbors.
   A downstairs neighbor, who asked that her name not be used,
described the Gentiles as a couple who kept to themselves and were
known to argue frequently.
   ``They just bought a house. They're supposed to be a typical
American family, moving to Staten Island with the two kids,'' the
neighbor said.
   After she brought the baby home, Mrs. Gentile had complained
about the baby's colic, a condition which makes infants cry for
prolonged periods of time.

   Gunmen eluded a huge police manhunt
early today after fleeing his resort town with three hostages
following a botched robbery and 24-hour siege in which five people
were killed and 42 held captive.
   All hostages were later freed.
   Unconfirmed local press reports said the robbers took about
$13,000 in bank money. Carlos Cano, a policeman participating in
the hunt, confirmed some money was taken but declined to say how
much.
   About 500 police and army personnel backed by a helicopter
searched for the seven young men Thursday night and police set up
blockades on highways leading out of the city.
   ``The gunmen must have gone to the Sierra, where it will be
difficult to locate them,'' said Cano, referring to the nearby
Sierra Madre mountain range.
   The gunmen had holed up inside the local offices of the National
Bank of Mexico after the foiled robbery. They let their 42 hostages
go Thursday and were permitted to flee in an armored car with three
Red Cross workers.
   Police said the robbers released the Red Cross workers 15
minutes later, when they abandoned the armored car at a gas station
and took off in a stolen pickup truck and station wagon.
   One of the Red Cross workers, Rosario Angulo, said there were
only five gunmen in the armored car, which he was forced to drive.
Angulo said one of his captors had an arm wound.
   ``I think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment
of leaving the bank,'' he said. Most police officers had withdrawn
from around the bank just before the seven men left, apparently as
part of an agreement ending the standoff.
   Angulo said the robbers strapped sticks of dynamite to their
bodies and toted sawed-off machine guns. He said the men were calm.
   Angulo and the other two Red Cross hostages were unhurt.
   Mexican authorities routinely patrol the rugged Sierra Madre in
search of marijuana and opium poppy plantations and clandestine
airstrips used by drug traffickers.
   Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa of Sinaloa state told the
Televisa TV network Thursday that the release agreement allowed
police to pursue the gunmen.
   ``We're not deceiving anyone,'' the governor said. ``We simply
reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives.''
   Ignacio Lara, a spokesman for the governor, said the gunmen
demanded earlier that they be allowed to leave by air. Police said
the robbers were in their late teens or early 20s and had no
political motives.
   The standoff in Los Mochis, a town of 120,000 on the Gulf of
California about 500 miles south of Tucson, Ariz., began at 12:45
p.m. Wednesday when the gunmen took hostages after an alarm alerted
police there was a robbery in progress.
   Red Cross spokesmen said five people were killed and at least 15
wounded during the attempted robbery and ensuing siege after
hundreds of police surrounded the bank.
   Spokesman Jesus Acosta of the local Red Cross said one of its
rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight Wednesday
between police and the robbers.
   He said the others slain were a customer, bank official and
teller, and a policeman who was in the bank on business at the time
of the robbery and tried to prevent it.
   The wife of one hostage said her husband, farmworker Juan Jose
Terraza, 29, was seriously wounded during the gunfight and was in
grave condition at a local hospital. ``He only wanted to cash a
check'' inside the bank, she said.
   Bank robberies and other kinds of crime have increased
significantly in Mexico since 1982, when an economic crisis began
to eat away purchasing power and drive up unemployment.
   Sinaloa is known as a center for crime, especially of the type
linked to the illegal drug trade.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Neck-And-Neck In National Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush ran neck-and-neck in national poll results announced today,
but Dukakis lost support when Jesse Jackson was listed as his
running-mate.
   The poll of 900 voters, commissioned by USA Today and Cable News
Network, gave Democratic front-runner Dukakis 45 percent to Bush's
43 percent _ a difference that fell within the survey's 3.3
percentage point margin of error.
   But when Jackson was listed as Dukakis' running-mate, Bush got
49 percent to Dukakis' 42 percent.
   The survey also found three out of four voters said their vote
for Bush or Dukakis would be unaffected by whether the candidates
selected female running mates.
   The poll, by Gordon S. Black Corp., was conducted after
Tuesday's New York primary. It showed the Massachusetts governor
got no apparent boost from his victory in that state. A USA
Today@CNN survey two weeks ago showed Dukakis ahead of the vice
president, 48 percent to 43 percent.
   However, the latest poll indicated a stronger anti-Jackson
sentiment than the earlier survey. In the earlier poll, a
Dukakis-Jackson ticket edged Bush, 49 percent to 45 percent.

   ``During the grand finale with all the fireworks, they were

   Noise from the event reached 111 decibels, about the same level
as a jet airliner taking off 200 feet away, Seipel said.
   The show's promoter, Bill Graham Presents, and Sacramento City

concert, which attracted 27,000 to the college's Hughes Stadium.
   Noise violations are misdemeanors with maximum penalties of a

<HEAD>Aspin Criticizes US Response in Persian Gulf; Adams Calls For War
Powers Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee says the United States may have overreacted by attacking
Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for mines laid in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``We may have shot ourselves in the foot,'' said Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis. ``There is good reason to suspect that the mines that
prompted Monday's retaliation were not laid by Tehran authorities,
but by some Iranian radicals looking to start a fight.''
   ``Our restrained policy in the gulf worked superbly until now,''
Aspin said in remarks prepared for delivery today.
   ``We had shown sufficient force to convince Iran to back off,
without reacting so bloodily as to generate the `martyrs' that the
(Iranian) radicals use to inflame public passions,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Senate is headed for another fight over invoking
the War Powers Act for President Reagan's Persian Gulf policy, but
even a prime supporter says he's unsure of what the effort will
accomplish.
   ``I'm not sure it will do any good,'' Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash.,
said Thursday. But Adams said he plans to push anyway for invoking
the 1973 law because it is on the books and thus should be followed.
   ``The consequences of selective observance of the law are truly
frightening,'' said Adams, who tried unsuccessfully for two months
last year to win Senate approval of a War Powers resolution.
   Adams also says he plans to introduce a bill authorizing the
continued deployment of Navy ships in the Persian Gulf.
   ``I am not trying to force the withdrawal of American forces,''
said Adams. ``We have a right to be there and have a mission to
perform there.''
   Adams said he wants Congress to take a stand on Reagan's
10-month-old policy of reflagging 11 Kuwaiti tankers and protecting
them with Navy convoys.
   ``We are abrogating our obligation under the Constitution and we
are abrogating our responsibility under the law,'' he said.
   Adams has been one of the Senate's strongest backers of invoking
the War Powers Act, the Vietnam-era law limiting a president's
authority to commit U.S. personnel to situations of ``imminent
danger.''
   Under some circumstances, the law requires withdrawal of the
troops after 60 days unless Congress votes to let them remain.
Reagan has asserted the measure is an unconstitutional limit on his
authority and he has refused to trigger its provisions for his gulf
policy.
   Aspin's remarks were his first major comment on Monday's clashes
in which U.S. Navy ships destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in the
southern gulf. Afterward, Iranian ships attacked Navy forces and
the Navy responded by sinking or damaging six Iranian ships.
   Administration officials said the U.S. strikes at the platforms
were retaliation for last week's mining of the frigate USS Samuel
B. Roberts. Ten sailors were injured and the ship was nearly sunk
when the vessel hit a mine the administration said was laid by Iran.
   According to Aspin, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime
``re-evaluated its Persian Gulf policy in January'' and decided not
to confront the United States any more.
   ``There is good reason to suspect that some irate (Iranian)
radicals decided to light a fire in the Persian Gulf,'' he said.
   He said ``it would not take more than a handful of Revolutionary
Guards to drop some mines in the gulf sea lanes'' and cause a
``return to the glorious confrontational days of yore.''

<HEAD>Nile Delta Slowly Eroding Into Sea, Researcher Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sinking land and rising seas will cause
Egyptian lands where more than a million people now live to be
covered by water over the next century, a Smithsonian Institution
researcher reports in a study published today.
   Daniel J. Stanley, senior oceanographer at the Smithsonian's
National Museum of Natural History, said in an article in Science
that by the year 2100, the Mediterranean Sea will cause major
flooding of the Nile River delta land between Port Said on the Suez
Canal and the Damietta branch of the Nile.
   ``The sea is cutting back the shoreline now at the rate of 50 to
100 feet a year in some areas,'' said Stanley. ``The sea is acting
like a saw and grinding away at the soils and sediments in the
area.''
   ``I see it as a very serious problem eventually,'' he added.
   Some dry land now more than 20 miles from the shoreline could be
covered by up to three feet of sea water by the end of the next
century, Stanley said. Much of this land now is used to grow crops.
   The seawater invasion is being caused by the action of three
forces, the scientist said.
   First is the rise of the sea itself. Stanley said sea level is
climbing in the northeastern Nile delta at the rate of about 1{
feet a century. The second factor is that the ground in the area is
sinking at about the same rate. The third factor is the Aswan Dam
on the Nile River.
   Based on corings of the sediment in the area, it appears the
land subsidence and the rise in sea level rise have been under way
for about 7,500 years in the Nile delta, Stanley said. The loss in
land was kept in check, however, by tons of sediment washed down
the Nile River every year. The sediment collected along the
shoreline, allowing the land to maintain its relative position to
the sea.
   But in 1964, the Aswan Dam on the Nile was closed and the
sediment was blocked. Instead of being deposited on the shore, the
sediment now is collecting in Lake Nassar, in back of the dam.
   Without this sediment, the shoreline of the delta began to wash
away.
   ``On a year-to-year basis, the effects will only be marginally
felt,'' said Stanley. ``But over decades, you will see a changing
position of the water level.''
   He said the fresh ground water in the area is slowly being
tainted by saline sea water. This, he said, could seriously affect
Egyptian efforts to develop agriculture, irrigation and industry in
the area.
   ``This is sort of the breadbasket of Egypt,'' said Stanley.
``The most serious ramifications are to the agriculture.''
   About a million people now live in areas that will be flooded by
the year 2100, Stanley said. Port Said, a major city at the
northern end of the Suez Canal, is in the threatened area. So are
important farming and industrial projects. The researcher said the
canal itself probably will not be affected.

   A frightened young bull escaped
during a livestock sale and rampaged through nearby streets,
knocking over a baby carriage and injuring four people, one with a
tossed concrete post.
   The victims of Thursday's chaos were treated for minor injuries
at a hospital in this city 140 miles northwest of London.
   After fleeing the market and pedigree show, 16-month-old
Molyneux Bernie threw 74-year-old Phyllis Sharp 10 feet into the
air, knocked Judith Bucknall, 37, off her bicycle, rolled on top of
Irene Williams, 38, and pushed over her 3-year-old daughter's baby
carriage. The child was not hurt.
   Richard Ward, 50, was hurt by a concrete post the bull tossed in
the air.
   At one point, the animal ran into a factory yard and workers
tried to trap him by closing the gates, but the bull trampled down
the gates and roared off. It was later sedated and captured.
   ``It was the worst experience of my life and one I would not
care to repeat,'' said the bull's owner, Harold Morris.

<HEAD>Mysterious Intruders Reportedly Penetrate U.S. Military
Installations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say they are
frustrated over their inability to catch the mysterious intruders
who reportedly penetrated American military installations near the
Panama Canal twice this week.
   The incidents Tuesday and Wednesday nights brought to four the
number of intrusions at American military facilities reported by
the U.S. Southern Command in the past two weeks. All were termed
serious.
   Neither the Panamanian government nor the Panamanian Defense
Forces commented on this week's incidents. Last week they ridiculed
U.S. accounts of intrusions, saying the Marines apparently fired at
``swaying palm trees.''
   The command said Thursday that no casualties were reported in
the latest intrusions. It said that an Army patrol detonated two
claymore mines to scare off one group of about 30 men and an Army
sentry drew gunfire in another case.
   ``If we could get our hands on one of them, we'd know what we're
dealing with. It's frustrating,'' said Bill Ormsby, a civilian
spokesman for the command.
   ``They are highly trained professionals who are trying to elicit
a reaction through intimidation, through harassment,'' he added.
   In Washington last week, the Defense Department's chief
spokesman, Dan Howard, suggested to reporters that the first
intrusion on April 11 was carried out by Panamanian military
personnel commanded by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, Panama's strongman, has headed the Defense Forces since
1983. He is under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking charges. He
has rejected the charges. The Reagan administration has sought his
ouster for months, as has a growing internal opposition.
   Howard and the Southern Command acknowledged Thursday they have
no hard evidence to identify those intruders or the ones on April
12 or the latest two reported incidents.
   ``I wouldn't want to speculate that it's even the same people,''
said Lt. Cmdr. Gregg Hartung, another command spokesman. ``One
thing we do know _ they're good, highly professional.''
   A Marine was killed April 11 when fellow guards accidentally
shot him while trying to surround what they described as a group of
eight intruders at a fuel storage depot near Howard Air Force Base.
   The next night, about 100 Marines said they exchanged small arms
fire and fired three mortar rounds at intruders numbering from 40
to 50 at the same place, the 807-acre Arraijan Tank Farm.
   Hartung said that on Tuesday night a sentry tried to halt three
men near a fence surrounding an Army munitions depot near the
Rodman Naval Station.
   He said one intruder fired a revolver at the guard, who returned
fire and called for help. The intruder fired at least one more shot
at the guard, then fled with his companions before a 12-man Marine
Quick Reaction Team arrived, Hartung said.
   He said the gunman apparently crawled through a culvert under a
security fence surrounding the ammunition dump while his two
companions stayed on the other side.
   ``But all three were well inside U.S. defense territory,''
Hartung said. ``They were only about 75 meters away (nearly 250
feet) in an area partially illuminated by security lights and we
think he (the guard) got a good look at them.''
   Hartung said the guard reported all three wore camouflage
uniforms, with ``one wearing a light-colored beret and the others .
.. bush hats.'' He identified the guard only as a specialist 4th
class with the 154th Signal Battalion, which is permanently based
in Panama.
   On Wednesday, Hartung said, a three-man reconnaisance team from
the 193rd Light Infantry Brigade spotted about 30 intruders in a
hilly, jungled area 1{ miles west of the main runway of Howard base
at 8 p.m.
   Hartung said the soldiers set off two claymore mines by remote
control, apparently scaring the intruders away before an Army Quick
Reaction Team arrived. He said the reconnaissance team was not on
guard duty, but declined to say why they were in the area.
   He said the mine blasts were not an attempt to harm the
intruders, ``but to create a diversion.''
   Hartung also said the soldiers did not fire their M-16 automatic
rifles, so as not to give away their position.
   The Army munitions depot, the fuel storage area and the air base
are within a few miles of each other, just outside Panama City on
the Pacific Ocean end of the canal.
   Hartung and Ormsby said an exhaustive sweep of the fuel storage
depot failed to turn up proof of the intruders' identity.
   However, the Southern Command said in a statement that ``a
limited amount of circumstantial physical evidence was found'' to
support Marine claims that they were engaged in a firefight.
   It said the evidence included ``two bottles of insect repellant
not used by U.S. forces, a first aid bandage, and a black-colored
handerchief.'' It said no shell casings were recovered.

   Riot troops broke up the second
anti-American demonstration in this capital in as many weeks,
hurling tear gas grenades and firing into the air to stop about 200
protesters headed for the U.S. Embassy.
   At least one person was arrested. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
   The protesters, chanting ``Embassy, embassy!'' had been part of
a crowd of about 2,000 people who marched peacefully to the
National Congress earlier Thursday to demonstrate against the
Honduran government and U.S. policy in the Central American country.
   Five people were killed during a riot April 7 in which about
2,000 demonstrators sacked and burned the U.S. Consulate and
offices of the U.S. Information Service. Those protesters were
angered over the deportation to the United States of a Honduran man
accused of drug trafficking.
   About 50 riot police and army troops threw tear gas grenades
into the 200 demonstrators as they advanced on the U.S. diplomatic
mission Thursday night.
   The tear gas dispersed the protesters momentarily, but they
regrouped, cutting off a small contingent of what appeared to be
young and ill-trained troops who shot long bursts of fire from
their M-16s into the air. The sound of shots sparked panic in the
neighborhood.
   Some demonstrators taunted the troops and threw stones at the
soldiers, who at intervals advanced behind metal shields.
   During the milelong march earlier Thursday, protesters chanted
slogans calling for the expulsion of the approximately 1,100 U.S.
troops based in Honduras, the removal of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
rebels from Honduras and the defense of the Honduran Constitution.
   They condemned the government of President Jose Azcona Hoyo and
what they called his subservience to Washington. Honduras is the
United States' staunchest ally in Central America.
   ``Yankee garbage, out of Honduras!'' and ``If the Yankees don't
get out, in Honduras they will die!'' shouted the demonstrators.
   The marchers, most of them students, walked to the National
Congress, where they listened to speeches condemning Azcona and the
United States.
   About 500 demonstrators proceeded from there to the nearby
Central Penitentiary, where they shouted for the release of inmates
they consider political prisoners.
   A group then tried to go to the U.S. Embassy.
   One of the issues the marchers protested was the forced
extradition of Juan Ramon Matta. Honduran police, working with U.S.
agents, arrested Matta at his Tegucigalpa home on April 5 and had
him flown to the United States.
   The Honduran Constitution prohibits the extradition of Honduran
citizens.
   Matta is in federal prison in Marion, Ill., awaiting trial on
drug trafficking charges. Matta is also wanted for questioning in
the 1985 torture-slaying in Mexico of U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   The U.S. Embassy estimates damage to the consulate building in
the April 7 riot at between $4 million and $6 million and has asked
for reimbursement from the Honduran government.

<HEAD>Delaware Considering Presidential Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation is expected to be introduced in
the Delaware Senate next week calling for a presidential primary to
replace the state's current system of party caucuses.
   Democratic state Sen. Robert I. Marshall said Thursday the bill
will call for a direct presidential primary to be held the second
Saturday in March, effective in 1992.
   The primary would result in delegates for the national party
conventions. Currently, Delaware holds caucuses and state
conventions for delegate selection.
   A presidential primary would ``empower and enfranchise Delaware
voters'' and give the state a more powerful voice in choosing the
president, Marshall said. He noted only about 5,000 Democrats
participated in Monday's caucuses in a state where there are more
than 126,000 registered Democrats.

   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson
spoke out more as an advocate of Republican unity than as a
presidential candidate on the eve of his expected victory in the
Nevada GOP convention.
   ``At this point it's pretty much concluded. ... The race is
over,'' Robertson said at a news conference Thursday. ``Moving the
Republican machinery behind (Vice President George) Bush is very
wise.''
   Bush and Robertson are the only Republicans left in the
presidential race.
   Robertson said he still is a candidate but instead of seeking
the nation's top job he now seeks to broaden the Republican party
to include ``a voice for conservative principles.
   ``I'm not in the race at this point in time trying to keep
ahead,'' Robertson said. ``I will be that rallying point for
conservatives.''
   Nevada Republican leaders expect Robertson to win at least 16 of
the state's 20 delegates during this weekend's state GOP
convention.

   City officials say they'll need assurances
from other area governments and local businesses before Annapolis
can accept an invitation to host the first of four proposed
presidential debates.
   The Commission on Presidential Debates on Thursday named
Annapolis as one of four cities invited to host debates this fall.
   While the other three cities _ Pittsburgh, Winston-Salem, N.C.,
and Omaha, Neb. _ have already accepted the invitation, Annapolis
officials said they aren't sure they can meet the 13 pages of
conditions required by the commission.
   If Annapolis can fulfill the demands, the debate would be held
Sept. 14.
   ``We're excited, but we have to be practical,'' said city
spokesman Thomas Roskelly.
   Roskelly said Annapolis must promise the commission it can meet
certain financial guarantees and provide assurances an adequate
number of hotel rooms will be available.
   The spokesman said the city can't meet all the conditions on its
own and will require assistance from the state, Anne Arundel County
and the private sector.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says North Korean President To Help End Cambodian
Conflict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk says North Korea's president has pledged to back his
efforts to bring Vietnam to the negotiating table and end the
9-year-old conflict in Cambodia.
   Sihanouk, in a letter received Thursday by Western news
agencies, said President Kim Il Sung also supports his plan to set
up a coalition government after Vietnam withdraws its troops from
Cambodia.
   Sihanouk said he told Kim that as the leader of a country on
good terms with the Soviet Union, China and Vietnam _ principal
players in Cambodia _ his recommendations ``would be considered
highly by all.''
   Kim said he would have an opportunity to discuss the Cambodian
issue with leaders from China and the Soviet Union, according to
the letter. Chinese Premier Li Peng is expected to soon visit
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
   Moscow is the main financial and material backer of Vietnam,
while Beijing supplies arms and other aid to the three-party
Cambodian resistance coalition led by Sihanouk and including the
Khmer Rouge.
   Communist North Korea had avoided involvement in disputes
between its giant Communist neighbors, including the dispute over
Cambodia.
   Kim provides Sihanouk a home in exile, but has not taken a
strong stand on Sihanouk's efforts to end the war.
   According to Sihanouk, Kim approved of his demands that
Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia and that the government Vietnam
established in Phnom Penh be dismantled.
   Sihanouk has called for a withdrawal of Vietnam's 140,000
troops, the introduction of an international peace-keeping force
and the establishment of a coalition government that includes
representatives of the Hanoi-backed regime.
   The prince is a member of Cambodia's traditional ruling family
and ruled the nation until he was ousted in a 1970 military coup.
   The Communist Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam
took over three years later. During their rule, the Khmer Rouge
killed an estimated 1 million to 2 million people in an attempt to
purge the country of Western and urban influences.

   A premature newborn chimpanzee named Lilly is
alive today thanks to volunteer pediatric specialists who brought
their hospital skills to an animal-care nursery.
   ``I think the No. 1 thing was that it sounded like they needed
some help,'' said Dr. Lance Wyble of the neonatal unit at Tampa
General Hospital. ``Also, I felt it would be a challenge. The
veterinarian wasn't too familiar with the situation, and I was very
familiar with it. The whole thing had a lot of appeal.''
   Wyble, two nurses and a respiratory therapist from the hospital
and a blood bank doctor teamed up with Busch Gardens veterinarian
John Olson here three weeks ago to save the 2-pound primate.
   Today, Lilly seems to winning her battle to survive. The chimp
is out of intensive care, and she's alert and is taking formula on
her own, although she still has a stomach tube for feeding.
   The medical team is following the chimp for any developing
problems, anemia or episodes of failed breathing.
   ``She's still got a long ways to go,'' Wyble said Thursday
night. ``We're looking for evidence of good weight gain _ that's
the ultimate proof that everything is going well.''
   The medical team twice had to revive Lilly when breathing
stopped and her heart rate fell dramatically.
   They also ran intravenous fluids, attached monitoring equipment,
hooked up oxygen, injected antibiotics, inserted feeding tubes,
tested blood gases and gave transfusions.
   ``I felt like I was at work. That's how critical it was. She was
dying,'' said nurse Peggy Herman.
   ``After the first 15 minutes you forgot it was an ape and could
see how much she was like one of our babies,'' said the other
nurse, Kathy Arnold.
   ``It's so neat to be able to use your experience and background
to help another species,'' she said. ``It wasn't like Lilly was
weird. She was just like a baby _ she'd grasp your finger, want to
cling, whimper when you start an IV.''
   Ms. Herman, a critical-care nurse for nearly 15 years; Ms.
Arnold, with 10 years in nursing; and respiration therapist Bob
Tursi volunteered their help.
   The chimpanzee was born March 31 at Busch Gardens, a wildlife
and amusement park that is home to 334 species of animals. Olson
said he thinks Lilly was born two to three weeks short of the
normal 7{-month gestation period.

   A study found there is a one-in-50 million chance
of getting the AIDS virus in a single sexual encounter with someone
who doesn't know whether he is infected, but is not considered
``high-risk'' and uses a condom.
   That compares with a one-in-10,000 to one-in-100,000 chance of
getting the virus from the same type of encounter with a person who
is in a high-risk group, said the study, reported in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   High-risk partners are people who, anytime within the past 10
years, have had male homosexual contact, shared intravenous drug
needles, lived in Haiti or Central Africa or received multiple
blood products, the study said.
   Using condoms lowers risk of getting AIDS about 10-fold,
regardless of other factors, said the study. Relying on a lab test
that establishes one's sexual partner as free of the AIDS virus
lessens risk about 100-fold.
   The study also found that AIDS-prevention campaigns may mislead
the public when they stress condom use and fewer sexual partners
over another strategy _ a cautious courtship in search of a
low-risk lover.
   Choosing a partner who is known to have little chance of
carrying the AIDS virus reduces the risk of infection by as much as
5,000 times compared with the risk of engaging in sex with a
high-risk person, the study said.
   A knowledge of where the largest risks occur should lead people
``to move toward gradual courtships, to listen carefully for clues
about a potential partner's past and to ask directly about any
history of high-risk activities,'' the study said.
   ``We're not saying, `Throw away your condoms,''' said Dr. Norman
Hearst, one of the study's authors and assistant professor of
family medicine and epidemiology at the University of California at
San Francisco.
   ``We're just saying this is something else to pay attention to
that may be even more important,'' he said by telephone Thursday.
   Not only should a person ask a potential partner about past
behavior but the person should learn enough about the partner ``to
know whether to believe the answers,'' the study said.
   ``This would rule out sex with prostitutes, casual sex, and
indeed, much of what many people would consider to be normal
heterosexual behavior.''
   Hearst and a colleague, Dr. Stephen B. Hulley, analyzed
estimates of the prevalence of AIDS infection and the likelihood it
will be transmitted under different circumstances.
   An uninfected person had a one-in-50 million chance of getting
the AIDS virus in a single encounter with a person who doesn't know
whether he is infected, but who uses a condom and is not in a
high-risk group, the study said.
   The chance of getting the virus from a person who has a lab test
showing no evidence of AIDS infection but who continues to engage
in high-risk behavior is one in 500,000 for a single sexual
encounter in which a condom is used.
   The impact of the test on risk is relatively low because it
sometimes shows people to be free of the virus when they are not,
Hearst said. Also, people may fail to test positive for several
months after they are infected.
   Hearst said he believes the study is the first to quantify the
relative risks of various prevention strategies for AIDS, which has
struck more than 59,000 people in the United States and killed more
than 33,000.
   More than 2,300 cases, or about 4 percent, are believed to have
resulted from heterosexual contact.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the
body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to
life-threatening infections and certain cancers.

<HEAD>`Macbeth,' Starring Christopher Plummer and Glenda Jackson, Opens
on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with other critics; no PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Considering the hurly-burly that accompanied
``Macbeth'' on its tumultuous pre-Broadway tour, it's surprising
that the play which arrived Thursday at the Mark Hellinger Theater
makes any sense at all.
   But the revival, starring Christopher Plummer and Glenda Jackson
as Shakespeare's famous pair of murdering Scots, is a fast and
straightforward production. Unfortunately, this version of
Shakespeare's shortest play sacrifices passion and inspiration for
speed. Maybe all the blood was spilled in rehearsal.
   It was during those rehearsals that the show went through three
directors, several set and costume designers and a half dozen or so
actors. The theater program lists ``original direction'' by Kenneth
Frankel. Interim director Robin Phillips receives no credit at all,
and actress Zoe Caldwell gets billed for ``additional direction.''
   Who did what is impossible to determine but what's left on stage
is a credible if colorless interpretation of Shakespeare's tragedy.
Its generic quality is telegraphed the minute the audience walks
into the theater. What they see are large concrete-like slabs that
look like a post-modernist version of Stonehenge. At center stage
is a large blood-spattered throne, just in case you forget the
plot. The all-purpose setting, designed by Daphne Dare, could be
used for any of Shakespeare's tragedies.
   What gives the play its moments of fascination are the
performances of Plummer and Miss Jackson. Not much electricity
crackles between them, but individually they are able to set off a
few sparks. They do it through two strikingly different approaches
to their roles.
   Plummer's quiet, almost thoughtful Macbeth is revealed slowly.
At first, he is almost a bumbler, a good-natured if greedy man
spurred onward by an aggressive wife. But after Macbeth commits
that first murder, the actor reveals a cynical side that feeds on
the power. It serves him well as the man who killed to be king
eventually goes to his doom.
   Miss Jackson's panther-like performance is showier. She prowls
the stage like a cat in heat, lusting for power if not her husband.
The one problem with the portrait is that Miss Jackson seems
isolated from the rest of the cast. There's not much connection
between the queen and her consort, let alone the rest of Scotland.
Still, it's fun to watch the actress display her awesome technique
even if it's done in a vacuum.
   The large supporting cast is uneven. Alan Scarfe as Macduff
makes an unequal opponent for Macbeth, but Randle Mell is a
strong-voiced, even noble Malcolm. For some reason, one of the
play's three witches is a man, an equal opportunity idea that is
never developed. At least, these hags don't provoke laughter.
   The lighting by Marc B. Weiss is as simple as the sets but much
more imaginative as it dapples those dreary columns. Patricia
Zipprodt's costumes are also stylish and colorful, particularly an
earth-orange gown for Miss Jackson.
   ``Macbeth'' is not a disaster on the scale of the New York
Shakespeare Festival's recent all-star trashing of ``Julius
Caesar.'' Still, it doesn't offer any startling insights or
interpretations into a most difficult play to put on stage.
Audiences won't be embarrassed or bored by this production, but
then they won't be surprised or exhilarated either.
   In other reviews:
   Frank Rich of The New York Times writes: ``While the assets of
the production ... do produce scattered fine moments and keep chaos
at bay, the lack of a unifying guiding hand is apparent before
intermission and proves fatal thereafter. ... once blood begins to
beget blood, the performance goes nowhere.''
   In the Daily News, Howard Kissel credits the production for an
occasional ``vision of the world turned Inferno. More often than
not, however, it's no more wrenching than Limbo. ...
   ``The overall lesson is that a classic play ... should be done
only when a director has a clear, vital idea of how to do it, not
because stars are available.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose today in Tokyo finishing the
week higher against the Japanese yen, while stock prices were
little changed.
   The dollar closed at 124.65 yen, up 0.35 yen from its close of
124.30 yen on Thursday. It had opened the day at 124.29 yen and
ranged between 124.28 yen and 124.75 yen.
   Trading was mixed but the dollar-buying mood was strong, due
partly to the U.S.-Iran conflict, said Michiko Kawai of the Bank of
Tokyo.
   The selling of the dollars later in the afternoon by
export-related industries held back the currency a little, she said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 35.93 point loser Thursday, added another 8.96
points, or 0.03 percent, ending the day's trading at 26,837.12.
   ``Trading was relatively quiet as institutional investors
sidestepped the market in the advance of the announcement of U.S.
gross national product next week,'' said an official of a major
securities house, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Domestically, however, there is nothing to cause uneasiness
among investors, he said.
   ``Investors have a little concern about Wall Street, but it is
preventing the market from becoming overheated,'' he said.
   Popular issues were heavy electricals, automobiles and
non-ferrous metals. Trading houses, department stores and printings
were firm. Among the losers were constructions, textiles and
shippings.
   Volume of the first-section trade was a light 700 million
shares, up 650 million shares Thursday. Advancing issues outpaced
decliners by 457 and 444, while 162 issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo stock market will have a half-day session on Saturday.

<TEXT>
   The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to
take up legislation that would impose a five-year ban on the
manufacture, sale or possession of plastic firearms which can evade
detection machines.
   The legislation, which won unanimous approval Thursday in a
Judiciary subcommittee, defines a plastic gun as one containing
less than 3.7 ounces of metal.
   Rep. William J. Hughes, chairman of the subcommittee on crime,
said the metallic content was set at an amount that can trigger
magnetometer alarms.
   Rival legislation, supported by the National Rifle Association,
would require that guns be detectable, but calls for no minimum
metal content.

   Advocates for continued use of animals in
medical research, hoping to counter protests by animal rights
activists, say animals will play a major role in the search for a
cure for AIDS and heart disease.
   Heart surgeon Michael DeBakey and actors Helen Hayes and Tony
Randall on Thursday spoke out at a news conference in favor of
continued research using animals.
   DeBakey, who was first to perform a successful coronary bypass
and the first to successfully use a partial artificial heart,
recalled that when he was in medical school more than 30 years ago,
``not a single cardiovascular disease could be treated
effectively.''
   ``Now, we have patients who are living reasonably normal lives
for 20 or 25 years after surgery,'' DeBakey said. ``The only means
by which we can do these things is in working in labs with
animals.''
   DeBakey and the others said they chose this week to state their
case to counter Laboratory Animal Liberation Week protests by
animal rights activists who oppose all use of animals in medical
research.
   ``If a cure is to be found for AIDS and heart disease, I see no
alternative,'' Hayes said.

<HEAD>Murdoch Puts Boston TV Station Up For Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Rupert Murdoch says he's selling his
Boston television station because of his ``great uncertainty'' over
renewal of his exemption from the federal ban on ownership of a
newspaper and TV station in the same city.
   Murdoch put WFTX-TV up for sale Thursday rather than ask the
Federal Communications Commission to extend a waiver expiring June
30 that allows his News America Publishing Inc. to own both WFXT
and The Boston Herald.
   A Murdoch spokesman said several parties had expressed interest
in the station, but he declined to name them. He said no asking
price had been set.
   The Australian publisher's decision came one month after the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington struck down a
congressional amendment barring the FCC from extending temporary
waivers to its cross-ownership rule.
   FCC spokesman John Kamp said Murdoch did not apply for the
waiver extension for WFXT, a UHF station he reportedly bought for
$28 million.
   Murdoch assailed the FCC rule and Sens. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who sponsored the
no-extensions amendment.
   ``I hope that the American newspaper industry together with
broadcasters will continue to encourage federal decision-makers to
modify the arcane newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule, which
in fact works against the principle of diversity in such great
centers of population as New York and Boston,'' he said.
   The March 29 court ruling said the Kennedy-Hollings amendment
unconstitutionally singled out Murdoch, but the appeals judges left
intact the cross-ownership ban.
   ``While good progress has been achieved, WFXT has suffered as a
result of the regulatory cloud that the Kennedy-Hollings amendment
placed over our Boston operations,'' Murdoch said. ``There remains
great uncertainty as to the FCC's position regarding waiver
extensions in these circumstances.''
   Murdoch attorney Howard M. Squadron said in February that the
FCC was unlikely to permanently exempt Murdoch from the
cross-ownership rule in Boston.
   FCC general counsel Diane Killory said at the time that the FCC
normally grants temporary waivers to give the owner of a
newspaper-TV combination time to sell one of the properties for a
fair price and avoid a distress sale.
   For a permanent waiver, FCC rules require that the owner prove
that one of the properties is in financial distress. Both the
Herald and WFXT are known to be profitable.
   Murdoch received temporary waivers from the cross-ownership rule
after buying WFXT and the New York station WNYW-TV in 1986. He was
given until March 6 to sell either WNYW or the New York Post and
until June 30 to sell WFXT or the Herald. He sold the Post to New
York real estate developer Peter Kalikow for $37 million on March 7.

<HEAD>Gangsters' Safecracker-Turned-Humanitarian Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Morris ``Red'' Rudensky, a safecracker who
worked for mobsters Al Capone and Bugs Moran but later went
straight and became a lock and alarm expert for 3M Co., has died at
age 89.
   Rudensky, who ended his life as a well-known humanitarian in St.
Paul, died Thursday in the Sholom Home in St. Paul, where he had
lived for the past five years.
   Born on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Rudensky spent 35 years in
state and federal prisons, and made a series of sensational
escapes. In one, he packed himself into a canvas bag with an
unembalmed corpse.
   After his parole in 1944, he became a lock consultant and
spokesman for 3M Co.'s home security business ``because of his
background and his expertise,'' said Sam Bates, a spokesman for
Maplewood-based 3M.
   ``He toured the country, appeared on talk shows (including) ...
the Dinah Shore show and the Merv Griffin show and developed sort
of a celebrity status because of that.''
   In 1970, Rudensky published an autobiography, ``The Gonif,''
which is Yiddish for ``thief.''
   In his later years, the repentant Rudensky was active in the St.
Paul Clown Club, which often performs for children in hospitals,
and organized the ``Red Rudensky Variety Show,'' a vaudeville
troupe that performed at nursing homes.
   ``He used his past to make the future count,'' said Lynn
Mastenbrook, a distant relative.
   Born Max Motel Friedman, Rudensky was sent at age 13 to the New
York State Reformatory. He escaped and made his way to Chicago,
where he slipped into the world of organized crime and robbed safes
for the Capone and Moran gangs. He also worked as a safecracker in
Kansas City, St. Louis and and Detroit.
   He changed his name to Rudensky after he was arrested in Kansas
City and mistakenly identified as another wanted safecracker named
Morris Rudensky.
   ``Because the crimes of Rudensky were less than the crimes of
Maxie (the Red) Friedman, he went to jail for Rudensky's crimes,''
said a family friend. ``If he had gone to jail for Friedman's
crimes, he would have been put away a lot longer.''
   About 1927, he was sent to the federal penitentiary at
Leavenworth, Kan., and escaped from the prison twice.
   When World War II began, Rudensky got behind the war effort and
organized federal prisoners nationwide to make clothing and
equipment for the armed services. It was this effort that helped
him win his parole.
   Three years ago, Rudensky's gangland memorabilia, including his
lock-picking tools and photographs, were donated to the Minnesota
Historical Society.
   Rudensky was married in 1950 to Eileen Abdo, who died of cancer
in 1974.
   There are no immediate survivors. Services were scheduled for 2
p.m. today at Chesed Shel Emes Cemetery in St. Paul.

turbulent weather pummeled the state Thursday, with winds gusting
to near 60 mph, golfball-sized hail and a short-lived tornado was
reported north of Denver.
   In Arizona, a twin engine Gallup Air Transport airplane hit a
small snow drift on takeoff and crashed on the tarmac Thursday
morning at Flagstaff's Pulliam Airport. The airport had about 6 to
7 inches of snow on the ground. No injuries were reported.
   Up to 6 inches of snow fell in parts of eastern and northern
South Dakota Thursday with more precipitation expected statewide
today. A winter storm watch was posted today for the southern
portion of the state.
   Snow was scattered early today in extreme western Nebraska and

<HEAD>Higher Doctor Bills Cutting into Savings of Heart-Attack Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of an average hospital stay for
heart-attack patients dropped by nearly half between 1972 and 1982
because of more effective, quicker treatment, a new study concludes.
   ``Put simply, doctors had better diagnostic and therapeutic
tools available by 1982, and they began using them _ particularly
coronary bypass surgery,'' said John Showstack, one of four authors
of the study published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   In 1972, a heart-attack patient with complications would be
hospitalized for an average of 23 days and pay a bill of $20,900,
Showstack said. By 1982, that same type of patient was hospitalized
for an average of just 13 days and billed $10,200. Both bills were
calculated in terms of the value of the dollar in 1982.
   However, doctors' costs, which comprised 4 percent of the total
bill in 1972, reached 12 percent of the total by 1982, said
Showstack.
   And in five 1982 cases where doctors performed coronary bypass
surgery, the average total bill was $45,728 _ with doctors' costs
making up about 29 percent of the total, he said.
   ``Everybody directed their efforts at lowering hospital costs,
but they missed the rising costs on the other side of the bill,''
said Showstack, a public-health researcher at the University of
California-San Francisco,
   ``And based on some other studies we've done, it's safe to say
that both trends are continuing _ though not at the accelerated
rate we saw over the 10-year period.''
   Researchers looked at the medical records of 164 patients
admitted to a San Francisco hospital following heart attacks in
1972, 1977 and 1982.
   In coronary bypass surgery, a vein is removed from a patient's
leg and used to bypass an obstructed artery leading to the heart.
Other costly surgical procedures now commonly used to treat heart
attack patients include angioplasty, surgically inserting a balloon
into an artery and inflating it to widen constricted blood vessels.
   The San Francisco study did not address the effectiveness of the
various treatments in prolonging patients' lives.
   Showstack said: ``Some patients would die, clearly, without a
bypass. On the other hand, there's really no evidence that
post-heart-attack patients live longer with a bypass.''

<HEAD>PLO Chief Welcome In Syria For Talks To End Rift, Aide Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior aide to Yasser Arafat said today
that Syria would welcome the PLO chairman for reconciliation talks
with President Hafez Assad to end the two Arab leaders' 5-year-old
rift.
   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
political department, made the statement after a four-hour meeting
with Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam.
   Assad sponsored a mutiny against Arafat by radical Palestinian
factions in 1983 and expelled the PLO leader from Damascus. The two
have been at odds since.
   The meeting between Khaddam and Kaddoumi was the first in five
years between a ranking Syrian official and senior Arafat aides.
   Kaddoumi was accompanied by four members of the central
committee of Arafat's Fatah movement, the main faction in the PLO.
   Despite the optimistic note sounded by Kaddoumi, informed
Palestinian sources said there were still profound differences
between Assad and Arafat that will take time to resolve.
   They cautioned that there were no immediate prospects of Arafat
visiting Damascus to meet the Syrian president.
   Assad, Moscow's main Arab ally, has been under pressure from the
Soviets to reconcile with Arafat for the sake of Arab unity to
present a common front at any Middle East peace conference that may
be convened.
   Kaddoumi's meeting with Khaddam marked a significant step in
that direction.
   Speaking to reporters following the late night meeting, Kaddoumi
said he and Khaddam, one of Assad's closest aides, agreed to
continue discussions to reach political agreements to support the
Palestinian struggle against Israel.
   He noted that a ``spirit of optimism and hope prevailed'' at the
meeting for the resumption of relations between Syria and the PLO
and ``to take broader and new steps in the history of the Arab
struggle.''
   ``I expect Arafat to come here as soon as possible. The door is
open for all the (Palestinian) brothers to come to Syria. There are
no obstacles,'' Kaddoumi said.
   George Habash, leader of the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, told The Associated Press at his Damascus
headquarters that Arafat scrapped plans to fly to Syria to attend
the funeral of one of his top officials because the Syrians had
given no guarantees he would be given an official welcome.
   There had been hopes the funeral in Damascus on Wednesday of
Khalil Wazir, the PLO's widely respected military commander, would
provide the opportunity for Arafat to visit Damascus.
   ``If I were in his shoes, I would not have missed this
opportunity,'' Habash said.
   Wazir, better known by his nom de guerre of Abu Jihad, or Father
of the Holy War, was assassinated by a commando squad in Tunis last
Saturday. Israeli sources have said privately that the commandos
were Israeli.

<HEAD>Tandy Announces First Erasable Compact Disk, IBM PS-2 `Clone'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tandy Corp. says it plans to sell the first
erasable-recordable compact disk, an announcement that angered the
recording industry, which fears consumers will use the product to
copy music at home.
   The Fort Worth, Texas-based electronics manufacturer, which
markets its products through its Radio Shack stores, also announced
Thursday it will introduce a fast new personal computer that
follows the design of International Business Machines Corp.'s
year-old Personal System-2.
   Tandy said the compact disk, known as the Thor CD, would be
available for music in 1{ to two years and for data about a year
after that, once recording and playback devices are built. The Thor
CD could also be played _ although not recorded on _ in standard
compact disk players, Tandy said.
   ``We're always concerned about technologies that threaten to
enable consumers to infringe on copyrights,'' said Trish Heimers,
spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of America.
   The association has fought digital audio tape, or DAT,
technology that would allow people to make high-quality recordings
at home.
   Tandy said it would not only manufacture Thor CD equipment, but
would also license other companies to make it.
   Some day the invention might yield the company ``hundreds of
millions of dollars'' a year in profits from sales and royalties,
John Roach, Tandy's chairman and chief executive, said at a New
York news conference.
   The Verbatim division of Eastman Kodak has said it will
introduce read-write compact disk technology, and several Japanese
companies are known to be working on similar products, The New York
Times reported today.
   The Times said some industry analysts were skeptical about
Tandy's invention, in part because Tandy didn't show working
hardware at the introduction.
   ``This is by no means a perfected technology,'' said Tim
Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies in Santa Clara, Calif.
   Tandy said it will be selling its Tandy 5000 MC in volume by
July, a few months before Dell Computer Corp. of Austin, Texas, the
only other company that has announced a PS-2 ``clone.''
   Tandy officials said their new computer was covered by a patent
cross-licensing agreement with IBM, although certain PS-2 patents
that may be issued to IBM in the future are still subject to
negotiations.
   Tandy stock rose $2.62{ a share to $45.75 Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
   A day set to mark the 40th anniversary of Israel
at the University of Illinois campus here ignited clashes between
pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups that led to 17 arrests,
authorities said.
   The campus branch of B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation, a Jewish
group, sponsored an anniversary program in a lecture hall on campus
Thursday, said Paul Fanning, a university spokesman.
   A group of 50 or 60 pro-Palestinians gathered in an outdoor area
in the center of campus along with an equal number opposed to the
Palestinian group, he said.
   ``It was noisy but orderly for about an hour, then there was an
outbreak of scuffles between the demonstrating groups,'' Fanning
said.
   Ten pro-Palestinians stormed the program inside the auditorium
and were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, officials
said. The remaining arrests took place outside.
   During the indoor program, Illinois-Chicago mathematics
professor Izzy Weinzweig confronted pro-Palestinians who had taken
the stage.
   ``I was in the Israeli army in 1948,'' Weinzweig said. ``I saw
my friends killed by these people under a flag of truce.''
   Most of the people arrested were charged with disorderly
conduct, but some were charged with battery, Chicago police said.

   Gunmen eluded a huge manhunt early
today after fleeing the bank in this northwestern coastal city
where their botched robbery turned into a 24-hour hostage drama in
which five people were killed.
   Unconfirmed local press reports said the robbers took about
$13,000 in bank money. Carlos Cano, a policeman participating in
the hunt, confirmed some money was taken but declined to say how
much.
   About 500 police and army personnel backed by a helicopter
searched for the seven young men Thursday night and police set up
blockades on highways leading out of the city.
   ``The gunmen must have gone to the Sierra, where it will be
difficult to locate them,'' said Cano. The Sierra Madre mountain
range is nearby.
   The gunmen had holed up inside the local National Bank of Mexico
offices after an alarm foiled their robbery.
   They let their 42 hostages go Thursday when they were permitted
to flee in an armored car with three Red Cross workers.
   Apparently as part of an agreement ending the standoff, most of
the hundreds of police who had surrounded the bank withdrew and
people massed in the street outside the building.
   ``This is incredible. These people are supporting the robbers,''
a woman standing nearby told a reporter.
   Police said the robbers released the three Red Cross workers 15
minutes after leaving the bank, abandoning the armored car at a gas
station and took off in a stolen pickup truck and station wagon.
   One of the Red Cross workers, Rosario Angulo, said there were
only five gunmen in the armored car, which he was forced to drive.
   ``I think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment
of leaving the bank,'' he said.
   Angulo said the robbers strapped sticks of dynamite to their
bodies and toted sawed-off machine guns.
   Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa of Sinaloa state told the
Televisa TV network the release agreement allowed police to pursue
the gunmen.
   ``We're not deceiving anyone,'' the governor said. ``We simply
reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives.''
   Ignacio Lara, a spokesman for the governor, said the gunmen
demanded earlier that they be allowed to leave by air. Police said
the robbers were in their late teens or early 20s and had no
political motives.
   The standoff in Los Mochis, a town of 120,000 on the Gulf of
California about 500 miles south of Tucson, Ariz., began at 12:45
p.m. Wednesday when the gunmen took hostages after an alarm alerted
police there was a robbery in progress.
   Red Cross spokesmen said five people were killed and at least 15
wounded during the attempted robbery and ensuing siege.
   Spokesman Jesus Acosta of the local Red Cross said one of its
rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight Wednesday
between police and the robbers.
   He said the others slain were a customer, bank official and
teller, and a policeman who was in the bank on business.
   The wife of one hostage said her husband, farmworker Juan Jose
Terraza, 29, was seriously wounded during the gunfight and was
hospitalized in grave condition. ``He only wanted to cash a
check,'' she said.
   Bank robberies and other crime have increased significantly in
Mexico since 1982, when an economic crisis began to eat away
purchasing power and drive up unemployment.
   Sinaloa is known as a center for crime, especially of the type
linked to the illegal drug trade.

<HEAD>6,000 Prisoners Freed In Mass Amnesty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nationalist government today released
about 6,000 prisoners, including 19 political detainees, in a mass
amnesty marking the 100th day since President Chiang Ching-kuo's
death.
   Huang Shih-min, a Justice Ministry official, said about 16,000
other prisoners, including 11 charged with sedition, had their
sentences reduced. They remained behind bars pending completion of
the shortened jail terms.
   Justice officials said the release of 6,054 gangsters, drug
addicts, corrupt officials and other convicted criminals began at
dawn after brief ceremonies held at jails throughout the island.
   Each prisoner was presented a red package containing the
equivalent of about $17 to wish them luck, they said.
   Television showed the prisoners, some smiling and some tearful,
being met by anxious wives, children and other relatives waiting in
drizzly weather outside jail.
   Transportation officials reported all domestic flights and
trains were packed as prisoners and their relatives headed for home.
   Five political prisoners were welcomed by about 50 relatives and
members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party upon
arriving at Taipei's domestic airport from a jail on Green Island,
180 miles southeast of Taipei.
   Prominent dissident Tai Hua-kuang, 37, was among the political
prisoners released from Green Island. He was sentenced to life
imprisonment in 1978 on charges of plotting to topple the
Nationalist government by forming an underground communist
organization.
   Another dissident, Pai Ya-chan, had tears in his eyes as he told
reporters he was grateful for those people who ``fought hard for
human rights and ending political oppression.'' He said he wanted
to join opposition politics.
   Pai, 47, was sentenced in 1975 to life imprisonment for
distributing leaflets calling on Chiang, then chairman of the
ruling Nationalist Party, to reveal his wealth and to recall his
daughter from the United States to show his confidence in Taiwan.
   Under the commutation, death sentences were reduced to life
imprisonment, life sentences to 15 years and lesser sentences were
cut by one-third or one-half. Many prisoners released today already
were serving sentences reduced when martial law was lifted last
July.
   Huang said the commutations affected all but a few hundred
prisoners sentenced for first-degree murders, ammunition smuggling
and other crimes that could ``endanger national security and social
stability.''
   Two political prisoners did not have their sentences reduced
because they were accused of being Communists, officials said. Two
men jailed earlier this year for advocating an independent Taiwan
were not affected by the commutation because the verdicts are under
appeal.
   President Lee Teng-hui proposed the commutations in February
after succeeding Chiang, who died of heart failure Jan. 13. Lee,
the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist government,
approved final details of the plan on Tuesday.
   Among the released political prisoners were six Taiwanese
businessmen sentenced in 1984 and 1986 to 10-to-12 years in jail
for visiting mainland China on business, justice officials said.
   Last October, Chiang eased a ban on travel to the mainland to
allow family reunions. Many Taiwanese have since visited China to
explore business possibilities.
   Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, the late president's father,
led his government in retreat to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to the communists on the Chinese mainland. The
Nationalists still claim to be the rightful rulers of all China and
do not allow official contacts with the mainland.
   After Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, the government released
3,500 prisoners reduced the sentences of 13,000 others in a similar
mass commutation.

   Melanesian separatists attacked a
police station in this South Pacific territory at dawn today,
killing three French officers with machetes and hatchets and
kidnapping 26 others, officials said.
   About 20 people were wounded, including four Melanesians, in the
attack by about 30 mean in Fayaoue, on the outer island of Ouvea,
part of the Loyalty Islands off New Caledonia's eastern coast.
   The wounded were being taken by air to Noumea, capital of this
French territory 1,000 miles east of Australia. Two were reported
in critical condition, including a policeman shot in the back of
the head.
   Police launched a massive operation backed by helicopters to
locate the attackers, who officials said were hiding the abducted
officers in the bush. About 200 police reinforcements were rushed
to Ouvea.
   The rebels were demanding the police reinforcements withdraw and
a special envoy be sent by Paris, said Leopold Joredie, president
of the regional government in central New Caledonia.
   In Paris, Premier Jacques Chirac called an emergency meeting of
Cabinet ministers directly concerned with overseas territories and
security.
   Joredie, who said he had talked with leaders of the attackers,
told The Associated Press by telephone: ``The gendarmes (police
officers) held by the people in Ouvea are in good health. There are
no wounded among them. They are being well treated.''
   He said the attackers refused to negotiate until police withdrew.
   ``We regret that there were deaths, but it happened at a time
when they must stop considering us like birds on the road to
extinction,'' said Joredie, who is also official of the main
Melanesian separatist organization, the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front.
   The indigenous but minority Melanesians, or Kanaks, are seeking
to end 135 years of direct French rule and have vowed to boycott
Sunday's regional elections.
   More than 31 people, including 10 policemen, have died in five
years of riots, slayings and clashes involving predominantly French
settlers and Kanaks, who comprise 43 percent of the nickel-rich
territory's 145,000 people.
   The front claims to represent most Kanaks in the struggle for
independence.
   Front leader Jean-Marie Tjibaou told the AP by telephone that he
had no advance knowlege of today's attack.
   But he said it was ``part of colonial history. That is what
happens when you scorn and disdain the Kanaks.''
   Witnesses said the attackers seemed to be well prepared. The
police station was sacked and a large amount of equipment was
stolen.
   Details were difficult to obtain as communications between
Noumea and the island 90 miles away were abruptly cut.
   Families of the policemen, who lived at the station, were not
attacked and suffered no injuries, officials said. The three slain
policemen died from machete or hatchet wounds, police said.
   Tjibaou called the incident ``frightful,'' but said it was not
surprising in that ``demands for independence are absolutely not
taken into consideration, that people are scorned and the
government refuses to listen to them.''
   Last month, Tjibaou told a news conference in Sydney, Australia
that his group planned a ``confrontation'' before the elections. He
said at the time that ``outright war'' was impossible because of
the French military presence.
   Kanaks have consistently lost all elections on the independence
question, and Tjibaou called for the boycott Sunday to protest
redrawn electoral boundaries he says discriminate against Kanaks.
   Several family members and tourists evacuated from Ouvea today
arrived at Noumea airport.
   ``They evacuated all of the whites,'' said a young Belgian woman.
   The police station attack followed a bomb explosion earlier
today near military headquarters in Noumea, the capital, and the
torching of a town hall. There were no apparent casualties and no
group claimed responsibility.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JACK WILLIAMS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior officers said it will
take some time to determine how many missilies were fired at this
U.S. warship and two others in a daylong Persian Gulf clash with
Iranian forces.
   They noted with satisfaction that reports from Washington
indicating the Jack Williams account of Monday's missile firing was
not being disputed. High officals there were saying only that there
was ``no positive evidence'' that Chinese-made Silkworms were used.
   Capt. Donald Dyer, Commander of Destroyer Squadron 22, said the
fact that three ships were under fire, maneuvering and firing
chaff, ``could mean some duplication'' in the reports of missiles
being fired.
   ``But there is no doubt that missiles were fired at these
ships,'' he said.
   As to what type of missile was used, Dyer said; ``It was big, it
was fast, and it came from Iran.''
   The ships were the Jack Williams, a 3,700-ton guided missile
frigate, the 4,500-ton missile destroyer Joseph Strauss and the
7,810-ton destroyer O'Brien.
   The ships make up one of the three three-ship groups involved in
Monday's coordinated retaliatory raids on Iranian targets and
Iranian reprisals.
   Monday's clash was the fiercest between the Americans and the
Iranians since the U.S. Navy buildup in the gulf last July.
   Iran's deployment of the Silkworms, a Chinese-made variant of
the 30-year-old Soviet STYX missile, was revealed a year ago.
   The Silkworms had never been fired at any military or commercial
vessels passing through the strategic waterway.
   The missiles are about eight feet long and have a range of about
50 miles with a full 1,000-pound warhead. They fly at about 600
mph, just below the speed of sound, at about 100 feet above the
surface, homing in on the target by a narrow-band radar.
   Although crude by modern standards, the Silkworm is an effective
weapon.
   ``It just isn't smart,'' said Dyer. ``The silkworm has no brain.
Whatever it spots first, it will reach out and touch.''
   It was for that reason that the Iranian Silkworm missile that
hit the reflagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City last Oct. 17 was
termed a ``lucky shot'' by many Navy officers at the time.
   The missile, fired from the Faw Peninsula of southern Iraq, was
fired in the direction of Kuwait's big Al-Ahmadi oil terminal and
hit the tanker only because it saw it first, they said.
   Monday's fighting began after the U.S. Navy destroyed two
offshore Iranian oil platforms. President Reagan ordered the
platforms attacked as retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in
the Navy frigate Samuel B. Roberts last week and wounded 10 sailors.
   The Pentagon said an Iranian patrol boat was sunk, three armed
speedboats sunk or damaged and the frigates Sabalan and Sahand
disabled.

<HEAD>Anti-Acne Drug Linked To Hundreds of Birth Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is considering severely limiting
or banning the sale of a popular anti-acne drug because of its
estimate that hundreds of severe birth defects have been caused by
the medication, it was reported today.
   In a confidential memorandum dated Feb. 11 and obtained Thursday
by The New York Times, officials of the Food and Drug
Administration estimated that 900 to 1,300 babies were born with
severe birth defects from 1982 to 1986 because of the drug Accutane.
   Accutane, made by Roche Laboratories, a division of Hoffman-La
Roche Inc. of Nutley, N.J., is used against disfiguring acne. It
carries a strong warning label, and the company has conducted
extensive campaigns to publicize its risk of causing birth defects.
   A spokeswoman for the manufacturer disputed the government
figures, saying Thursday that it has reports of 62 cases of
Accutane-related birth defects among the 700,000 to 1 million
patients with cystic acne for whom the drug has been prescribed.
   ``We do not want to dispute the fact that this drug is
associated with birth defects,'' said spokeswoman Carolyn Glynn.
``We want to find ways to further reinforce that message.''
   Ms. Glynn said the company would meet with the FDA on Tuesday to
discuss ways to better educate the public, doctors and pharmacists.
   Despite clear warnings that the drug can cause devastating and
sometimes fatal deformities if taken by pregnant women, experts
estimate thousands have taken Accutane during pregnancy since it
came on the market in 1982, according to The Times.
   FDA officials also attributed 700 to 1,000 spontaneous abortions
to the use of Accutane, and they estimated that an additional 5,000
to 7,000 women had induced abortions ``solely because of Accutane
exposure and fear of birth defects,'' the newspaper reported.
   The estimates were extrapolated from data collected in a
Michigan Medicaid study.
   Ms. Glynn said that in the 62 cases of birth defects known to
the company, the babies were born with severe disfigurations,
primarily malformations of the head and ears. About half the
afflicted children died at birth, she said.
   Accutane accounts for between $40 million and $50 million in
sales annually, she said.
   The drug shuts down the production of sebum, which is the oily
fatty substance that causes the inflammation, pain and eventually
scarring of cystic acne. The drug's generic name is isotretinoin.
   Officials believe that many women and their doctors do not
always recognize the link between the drug and deformities in
babies.
   By September 1987, the FDA had received reports of only 52
babies with Accutane-caused deformities, according to the Times.
   Dr. Robert Stern, a dermatologist at the Harvard Medical School,
agreed the situation ``is a serious problem,'' but he said Accutane
is the only treatment available for many patients with disfiguring
acne.
   ``Accutane is an extremely important drug,'' he told the Times.
He stressed that severe acne, left uncontrolled, ``scars patients
both physically and psychologically.''

   Rock star Mick Jagger testified before
a courtroom packed with excited fans that he did not hear a reggae
song called ``Just Another Night'' before writing his own song with
the same name in 1983.
   Jagger, lead singer of the Rolling Stones, is being sued for
copyright infringement by Patrick Alley, 36, of the Bronx, who
claims Jagger pirated the chorus of his 1979 song.
   Appearing slightly nervous at he took the stand Thursday, Jagger
told U.S. District Judge Gerard Goettel and the jury that he had
often recorded works by other people in his 25 years as a musician
and had always given them credit.
   But, he said, he never heard Alley's song until he was sued by
Alley in 1986, one year after ``Just Another Night'' appeared on
the album, ``She's the Boss.''
   Asked by his attorney Peter Parcher whether he liked Alley's
song, Jagger said carefully: ``I don't want to cast aspersion on
Mr. Alley. A lot of people in this courtroom don't like my music.
Personally, I don't really like that song.''
   To demonstrate how Jagger developed his song, tapes dating to
November 1983 were played. The first tape was a version of the song
Jagger described as ``just me with acoustic guitar starting off
with this tune.''
   Jagger, who swayed with the music each time, occasionally
appeared embarrassed as some of tapes had him just making sounds
with the music.
   Jagger's guitar and other equipment had been set up in court,
but another of his lawyers, Gerald Margolis, said he would play
``only if he has to.''
   Another of Jagger's attorneys, Helene Freeman, said that if
Jagger performed it would be to show how he developed the song.
Independent development of the same or similar ideas would not
violate copyright law, she said.
   Earlier, Daniel Ricigliano, chairman of the theory department at
the Manhattan School of Music, said that while the rhythmical
settings of the two choruses were similar because of the similarity
of lyrics and ideas, the choruses were ``totally different'' in
every musical way.
   He said a review of song titles at the Performing Arts Library
in Lincoln Center revealed more than one dozen songs since 1928
with the title ``Just Another Night,'' and at least one with the
title ``Just Another Night with You.''
   An expert who testified for Alley said the choruses of the two
songs were ``virtually identical.''
   Alley's chorus contains the words: ``Can I spend another, just
another night, just another night, just another night with you.''
   Jagger's lines are, ``Give me just another night, just another
night with you. Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn
breaks through.''
   The jury will determine whether there was an actual infringement
of Alley's copyright. If there was, a second trial will determine
damages.

   Thousands of people sang, danced and threw roses
and confetti as 29 Kuwaitis freed by Arab gunmen after a 16-day
hijacking ordeal arrived home from Algiers.
   While the Kuwaitis celebrated Thursday, Western diplomatic
sources said the nine pro-Iranian hijackers, who were given safe
passage out of Algeria had reached Beirut.
   The two other freed hostages, Saudi Arabian citizens, were flown
home in a private executive jet.
   Today's editions of The New York Times quoted unidentified Arab
officials as saying the hijackers, who had killed two Kuwaiti
hostages, were flown on a private Algerian jet to Damascus, Syria,
and then were believed to have traveled by land to Beirut.
   The officials also were quoted as saying that, with the
exception of one Iranian, most of the hijackers were thought to be
Lebanese citizens.
   Western intelligence sources have said that the nine are
believed to be members of Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist group based in Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley.
   A PLO mediator in the hijacking was quoted by a Rome newspaper
today as saying the gunmen originally planned to land in Lebanon,
blow up the plane and keep the passengers hostage in Beirut. Syrian
troops, who control the airport, refused to let the plane land.
   As they arrived in Kuwait Thursday night, women threw roses and
confetti at the 22 passengers and seven crew members who had been
prisoners in the seized Kuwait Airways Boeing 747.
   Several said they were certain Iran was a party to the hijacking.
   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Ahmed Sabah, and Crown Prince
Sheik Saad Abdullah Sabah led the group of government officials and
relatives that met the freed captives at the Kuwait airport. The
hostages included three cousins of the emir.
   Kuwaitis at the airport celebrated their leaders' resolve in not
bowing to the hijackers' demand that Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists jailed for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in
Kuwait in 1983.
   Flocks of doves soared over the airport after the Kuwait Airways
Boeing 707 touched down, completing a six-hour flight from Algiers,
where the ordeal ended early Wednesday.
   Bedouin men danced and clapped at the Kuwaiti airport, and
children waved flags and sang, ``God bless our father, Jaber,''
referring to the emir.
   The freed hostages traveled by motorcade to the city center
along a route lined by thousands of people. Hundreds followed in
cars and limousines, honking their horns and singing, ``We
sacrifice blood and souls for you, O Kuwait.''
   The hijackers, who dumped the bodies of two Kuwaiti security men
from the seized plane while it was on the ground in Larnaca,
Cyprus, apparently agreed to free the remaining hostages in return
for safe passage.
   Algeria, which mediated, has refused to discuss the deal.
Algerian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the
hijackers slipped out of the plane shortly before the hostages were
let out.
   Some of the freed Kuwaitis said one hijacker was replaced by two
others when the plane landed in Mashhad, Iran, April 5, the day it
was seized on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight with 122 aboard.
   ``One of the two was obviously a military pilot. He was ordering
other gunmen around and telling them lots of things about the
aircraft and supervising the wiring of explosives to most parts of
the plane,'' said passenger Khaled Nasser Zaferi.
   The claims corroborated accounts of hostages freed earlier in
the ordeal, some of whom said additional weapons and explosives
were brought aboard in Mashhad, where the plane spent three days.
   The Times quoted the Arab sources as saying the plane was
supplied at Mashhad with communications gear that allowed it to
stay in touch with outside parties that were issuing instructions,
at least at Larnaca.
   Malaz Abdo, deputy director of the Palestine Liberation
Organization office in Cyprus, said the hijackers' plan to land in
Beirut was foiled when President Hafez Assad of Syria refused to
let the plane land, Rome's Paese Sera newspaper reported today.
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon.
   Abdo acted as a mediator in negotiations with the hijackers in
Larnaca, the plane's second stop.
   The hijackers released 57 hostages in Mashhad and 13 at Larnaca
in exchange for the fuel that took them to their third stop,
Algiers, where an elderly diabetic was released last week.
   Kuwait and other Arab countries praised Algeria for achieving
freedom for the hostages without additional violence. But the
United States, Britain and other Western powers criticized Algeria
for allowing the hijackers to get away.
   A Soviet-built Antonov transport of the Algerian air force was
seen taking off from the Algiers airport before dawn Wednesday,
shortly before the hostages left the hijacked plane. It was widely
assumed the hijackers were aboard.

<HEAD>Orders for Durable Goods Virtually Unchanged in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods were virtually unchanged in March as a drop in orders
for military hardware more than offset gains elsewhere, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$114.3 billion last month.
   That was a negligible $53 million rise and followed a slight 0.1
percent increase in February and a sharp 1.2 percent drop in
January.
   Economists had been expecting a substantial increase in new
orders for March. However, the February number represents a sharp
upward revision from a previous estimate of a 1.1 percent drop.
   In March, a 3.0 percent drop in the volatile defense goods
category, to $8.3 billion, more than offset a 0.3 percent increase
in orders for non-defense goods, which rose to $106.0 billion.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel jumped 4.2 percent in
March after a 0.9 percent rise in February. At $10.8 billion, they
stood 19.4 percent ahead of last year.
   There was also strength in transportation, primarily motor
vehicles and aircraft. It rose 2.5 percent to $31.3 billion, after
a strong 5.5 percent boost in February.
   Analysts, in advance of the report, attributed much of the
increase in that category to a rise in orders for Boeing Aircraft.
   Orders for electrical machinery plummeted 4.7 percent to $18.6
billion, while non-electrical machinery edged down 0.2 percent to
$19.7 billion.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, which economists
consider a good indicator of factory expansion plans, fell 1.3
percent, on top of a 3.0 percent decline in February. But, at $33.3
billion, it was still 20.1 percent ahead of a year ago.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 2.6 percent in March to $113.3
billion after a 1.4 percent rise in February.

   Police today arrested 20 Catalan
nationalists protesting the presence of King Juan Carlos and Queen
Sofia at ceremonies for the millenium of Catalonia, once an
independent kingdom and now an autonomous region of Spain.
   Police said most of the protesters were arrested while putting
up posters criticizing the royal visit. They later were released.
   Juan Carlos, whose father Don Juan de Borbon is the Count of
Barcelona, opened the ceremonies with speeches in Spanish and
Catalan.
   The events marking the 1,000th anniversary of Catalonia's break
from the domination of Charlemagne include conferences, festivals
and expositions.
   Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, is one of the country's four
historic regions and one of 17 autonomous regions. Most of the 6
million inhabitants speak Catalan, a Romance language, as well as
Spanish.

   Some Christian activists say they
will vigorously oppose a Universal Pictures movie based on a book
in which Jesus is portrayed as a wimp who lusts after a prostitute.
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' called a look at the human
side of Jesus, was shot in Morocco last fall. It stars Willem Dafoe
as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene and Harvey Keitel as
Judas Iscariot.
   Scheduled for release in September, the movie is based on Greek
author Nikos Kazantzakis' 1955 book ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' which was condemned as heretical by the Greek Orthodox
Church.
   In a section of the book that troubles some conservative
Christians, Satan tempts Jesus with lust for Mary Magdalene, a
prostitute who became one of his followers. In another, Jesus
apparently ponders homosexuality.
   ``I don't see how a producer can stay true to the book and not
come out with a movie that is offensive to the Christian community.
The book is shot through with contradictions of the scriptures,''
said the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a United Methodist minister who heads
the American Family Association in Tupelo, Miss., which monitors
television shows and films.
   ``We're trying to head the movie off at the pass so it's not
blasphemous,'' said Ted Baehr, editor of an Atlanta-based Christian
newsletter that monitors theatrical films.
   Only Martin Scorsese, who is editing the film in New York, knows
what's in the final version, and ``he doesn't talk to any press at
all when he's editing, on any movie,'' said spokeswoman Marion
Billings.
   Scorsese, who directed ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull,'' once
studied for the priesthood.
   ``This is a film that I've wanted to make for 15 years, both as
a filmmaker and Christian,'' he said in a statement. ``I'm making a
deeply religious film which is an affirmation of faith, and I ask
everyone not to judge my film until they see it.''
   Universal Pictures has hired a born-again Christian marketing
consultant, Tim Penland, who advised on the films ``Chariots of
Fire'' and ``The Mission,'' to help ward off controversy.
   ``I think there's an awful lot of interest in this movie in the
Christian community, and there's paranoia about what it contains,''
Penland said Thursday.
   Wildmon said a sacrilegious film would provoke a protest against
Universal and its parent company, MCA.
   ``We will be prepared to fight it with everything we've got. And
it would be an easy battle to win,'' Wildmon said.
   The Rev. John Probst, a Baptist minister whose Media Focus group
offers Bible study classes at studios and networks, has objected to
the portrayal of Jesus as ``a wimpy, almost milquetoast''
character. He has asked Christians to write Tom Pollock, chairman
of the MCA motion picture group, with their concerns.
   ``The attempt of this movie is not to be prurient about Jesus,''
Pollock said. ``This is one of our great filmmakers, and to cast
the film as sacrilegious before anyone has seen it is unfair.''

<HEAD>Faculty At Duke Votes To Increase Number of Black Professors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEG REYNOLDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A faculty decision to require more black
professors at Duke University makes the school a leader on an issue
that troubles nearly every college and university in the nation, a
black professor says.
   ``I think this whole affair will reflect positively on Duke,''
Erdman Palmore said Thursday after a faculty council adopted a
resolution to require each of the school's 56 departments and
programs to add at least one black faculty member by fall of 1993.
   ``As far as I know, we are the first university establishing
such a strong policy mandating the hiring of more black faculty.''
   The measure, passed 35-19, is subject to endorsement by the
administration, but approval was expected because the resolution
had the support of university President H. Keith H. Brodie.
   More than 100 students wearing black-and-white checkered
armbands cheered and waved signs at Thursday's crowded meeting as
the council adopted the resolution after weeks of heated campus
debate.
   ``It's a clear victory _ we're ecstatic,'' said Christopher
Foster, 20, chairman of the Black Student Alliance. ``It's going to
provide a clearly diverse education for students at Duke and give
us mentors in our field of interest.''
   ``We did it peacefully and diplomatically,'' added Karim Deane,
21, a black student from Lynchburg, Va.
   Duke has 31 black faculty members out of a total of 1,399.
Fourteen are in the university's medical school, while there are 40
departments with no black faculty.
   ``Last year, Duke hired 155 faculty _ five of them black,''
Brodie said prior to the vote. ``My prediction is without this
resolution, this year we will do about the same.''
   The resolution was largely symbolic, since the university
administration could have adopted the policy on its own, but it
preferred to get a faculty consensus first, said Philip Stewart,
chairman of the faculty committee.
   The debate had centered on whether the resolution should
``require'' the university to hire more blacks. The council on
March 17 struck the word, instead instructing the administration
``to provide incentives.''
   That vote sparked campuswide protests and generated a petition
signed by about 2,500 people asking the council to reconsider. All
seven members of the Committee on Black Faculty, which worked to
bring more black professors to Duke, resigned from the panel in
protest April 8.
   Thursday's vote restored the original language and also added a
demand for money for the recruiting of more black faculty.
   Duke officials said there are 758 minority students among the
6,423 undergraduates and 530 minorities among the 4,368 graduate
and professional students.

   Politicians are taking over from religious
leaders in the task of easing human suffering, former President
Jimmy Carter says.
   Religiously inspired warfare is creating more and more
suffering, Carter said Thursday at the opening of a three-day
conference on ``Theology, Politics and Peace'' sponsored by the
Carter Center and Emory University's Candler School of Theology.
   The conference is examining the role of religious values in the
making of political decisions.
   ``Religious leaders are failing, but the failure need not be
permanent,'' Carter said. ``All faiths have in them a seed of
hope.''
   Carter included in his criticism Pope John Paul II, whom he said
has failed to denounce human rights violations strongly enough.
   ``I have read his speeches, and I have been extremely
disappointed with the bland nature of them,'' Carter said in a
brief question-and-answer session after his address.
   He said the pope missed opportunities in Chile, El Salvador and
Nicaragua to criticize governments that have mistreated their
citizens.
   Carter said the war between Iran and Iraq in the Persian Gulf is
one of the bloodiest in history and is ``between two Islamic groups
whose differences are almost indiscernible to outsiders.''
   He also cited violence between Protestants and Roman Catholics
in Northern Ireland and between moderate and ultra-religious Jews
in Israel.

<HEAD>Three Blacks Killed, Four Policemen Shot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Gunmen today wounded four
policemen who were arresting participants in a rent boycott, police
and press reports said.
   Police said three blacks were killed Thursday. Two men were
stoned to death near the Cape Province town of Cradock, and a youth
was fatally shot near Durban, police said.
   Three black constables and a white sergeant were ambushed about
1 a.m. today as they drove through Soweto, a huge black community
outside Johannesburg, police said.
   A black civilian in their vehicle also was wounded, and a search
was launched for the assailants.
   The constables, whose names were withheld, were taken to a black
hospital in Soweto. Sgt. Gregory Beck was taken to a white hospital
in Johannesburg.
   Beck was quoted by the South African Press Association as saying
the officers had been arresting people for refusing to pay rent.
Thousands of Sowetans whose homes are owned by the municipal
council have been engaged in a rent boycott for nearly two years as
a protest against government policies.
   Police have frequently been the target of attacks since late
1984 when black communities began to fight back against white
control.
   Under the South African system of apartheid, the 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services. The 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs.
   In Cape Town and the Johannesburg-area industrial city of
Germiston, police units surrounded and searched offices of the
largest black labor federation, the Congress of South African Trade
Unions. The deployment coincided with commemoration services by
union members for seven black railway workers killed in clashes
with police one year ago during a strike.
   State-of-emergency regulations imposed Feb. 25 prohibit the
labor federation from commemorating anniversaries of ``violent
events.''
   The two black men killed in Cape Province, both 22, apparently
died in separate incidents in the black township of Lingelihle,
national police headquarters in Pretoria said in a statement.
Police did not name the men.
   A black youth was shot and killed by an unidentified gunman in a
black neighborhood near Durban, police said.
   Schools around Cape Town have been hit this week by student
demonstrations against detentions of students and teachers and
against the death sentence for the Sharpeville Six _ five men and a
woman accused of taking part in a mob killing of a black town
councilor four years ago.
   About 250 students at Alexander Sinton high school in Athlone
displayed placards today that read, ``Don't Hang the Sharpeville
Six, Hang Botha.''
   It was a reference to President P.W. Botha, who told Parliament
Thursday that he would move for black participation in
Cabinet-level policy-making as part of the dominant National
Party's program of gradual reform.
   Black militants seek full voting rights and abolition of
residential and school segregation, demands the Nationalists have
rejected.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev suggested to Secretary of
State George P. Shultz today that ``we're marking time'' in
superpower relations as hope for a new arms control accord faded.
   But Shultz disagreed. ``From our point of view, we are far from
marking time,'' he said. ``We are keeping time in a very strong
way.''
   Shultz differed with the Soviet leader's appraisal at a news
conference after a three-hour session. But Shultz did not list an
arms reduction treaty as one of the ``significant achievements'' to
be expected when President Reagan meets with Gorbachev in a Moscow
summit May 29-June 2.
   In fact, Shultz said, ``the going is hard'' to complete a pact
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons in the five weeks remaining.
   ``It's pick and shovel work,'' he said.
   Shultz's session with Gorbachev in the gilded Catherine's Hall
followed nine hours of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze over two days.
   When Shultz told the Soviet leader: ``I'm here to make
preparations for the president's visit,''
   Gorbachev responded: ``As for the substance, it seems that we
are losing something. Maybe we're marking time.''
   The two men shook hands at the outset, but Gorbachev seemed
somewhat subdued. American reporters were cautioned by Soviet
officials that if they tried to ask questions of Gorbachev during
the photo-taking session they would not be invited back.
   Usually, Gorbachev welcomes a few questions.
   There have been reports of a Kremlin power struggle between
Gorbachev and Yegor K. Ligachev, the man reputed to rank second in
the ruling Politburo.
   Ligachev is regarded as more conservative than Gorbachev,
especially on the Soviet leader's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness on selected topics. Reports this week have said
Ligachev may have been stripped of some of his power.
   Shultz made no mention of the reports at his news conference.
But he spoke positively of the way U.S.-Soviet relations have
evolved since Gorbachev's rise to power three years ago.
   He said Reagan's summit meeting with Gorbachev would have ``a
very businesslike tone'' and the two leaders would have ``a great
deal of substance to talk about.''
   Through interpreters, Gorbachev joked a bit with Shultz over the
many thousands of miles the American envoy had logged recently in
trips to the Middle East, the Soviet Union and Europe.
   American officials have virtually abandoned hopes of completing
a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles by the time the
summit starts.
   On the regional front, there was little superpower cooperation.
Despite another appeal by Shultz, the Soviets still declined to
support an international arms embargo against Iran, which delays
any action by the U.N. Security Council.
   A U.S. official told reporters Thursday that a newly submitted
Soviet draft on space defense conforms to a tough Soviet line that
could make weapons cutbacks impossible.
   President Reagan hoped to sign a treaty at the summit to reduce
arsenals of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30
percent to 50 percent.
   But the Soviets, suspicious of Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program,
want a guarantee they could halt the cutbacks if the United States
conducts tests in space judged to be in violation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   The Reagan administration has strenuously resisted limits on the
program that seeks a space-based defense against ballistic missiles.
   One small note of progress was an agreement on procedures for
joint underground nuclear tests in July. The first test will be
held in the Nevada desert, the other at Semipalatinsk, in the
Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.
   The idea is to compare U.S. and Soviet techniques for measuring
the extent of the explosions.
   In reports to Congress, Reagan has accused the Soviets of
exceeding the 150 kiloton ceiling set in 1974 and 1976 treaties.
The Soviets denied the charges.
   If the two sides can agree on measurements and make them more
precise, Reagan may submit the treaties to the Senate for
ratification before he leaves office next January.
   One kiloton is equivalent to the explosion of 1,000 tons of TNT.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze, who have held three rounds of talks,
will meet again in mid-May, two weeks before Reagan visits Moscow.
   In Washington last December, Gorbachev and Reagan signed an
accord ridding both of their nations of medium- and shorter-range
missiles. They called then for another pact cutting strategic arms
by 50 percent, but negotiations in Geneva have been proceeding
slowly.

   Police today hunted the killers of a
Mozambican rebel leader, and the rebels accused Mozambique's
Marxist government of assassinating him.
   Evo Fernandes, an influential figure in the Mozambican National
Resistance, was shot five times before his body was dumped outside
Lisbon, police said.
   The body was found Thursday on a country road about 20 miles
west of Lisbon after he met with suspected agents of the Mozambican
government, his wife said.
   Lisbon's Judiciary Police said in a statement today that
Fernandes had been shot once above the left eye, three times around
the heart and once in the stomach.
   The statement said police were investigating several clues they
expected to shed light on the crime.
   In a statement issued in Lisbon today, the rebels blamed the
Mozambican government for ``the barbarous crime.'' The government
of the southern African nation denied the allegation.
   The rebels, also known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO, have
been fighting a guerrilla war since 1977 to topple Mozambique's
government. Guerrilla representatives operate in Portugal, the
colonial ruler of Mozambique until 1975.
   Hundreds of police had been searching for Fernandes since
Monday, when his wife, Yvette, said he disappeared after meeting
two men who said the Mozambican government had empowered them to
initiate peace talks with the rebels.
   Fernandes, a founder and former secretary-general of RENAMO,
believed the two men he dined with Sunday were authorized to
approach him to set up negotiations with Mozambican officials, his
wife said.
   When her husband failed to return, Mrs. Fernandes said Monday
she believed he had been abducted by Mozambican security agents.
   Mozambican Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said today his
government had no connection with the killing.
   Mozambique ``does not commit acts of terrorism,'' he told the
official news agency AIM. He suggested that Fernandes was killed as
a result of ``splits and conflicts'' within RENAMO.
   Portuguese Foreign Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro condemned the
assassination.
   Mozambique and Angola have criticized Portugal for allowing
rebel spokesmen to operate in Lisbon. The Lisbon government says it
will act to prevent subversive actions by the rebels but cannot
interfere with the free speech of their spokesmen.
   Fernandes' body was found in undergrowth beside a road about six
miles north of the resort town of Cascais, where he lived. Cascais
is about 20 miles west of Lisbon.
   Fernandes, 44, a Portuguese citizen born in Mozambique, was
secretary-general of RENAMO from 1983 to 1986. He was later demoted
to head of the guerrillas' research department, but he remained an
influential figure within the group.
   RENAMO's Lisbon spokesman Manuel Frank said today that Fernandes
had gone to Mozambique in January and met rebel chief Afonso
Dhlakama. Dhlakama condemned the killing and praised Fernandes as a
``fighter for freedom'' in a statement distributed in Lisbon.
   Fernandes' predecessor as RENAMO secretary-general, Orlando
Cristina, was shot to death in his bed in April 1983 in Pretoria,
South Africa. Some reports blamed the murder on a rebel power
struggle, but RENAMO blamed Mozambican security agents.
   Fernandes was married twice and had six children.

<TEXT>
   A woman who told police in 1968 that she saw
a girl in a polka-dot dress running from the scene of Robert F.
Kennedy's slaying told a radio station that investigators badgered
her into changing her story.
   Sandra Serrano-Sewell, 40, said Thursday she never recanted her
tale of a young woman running from the Ambassador Hotel after the
Kennedy's assassination. The woman, she said, told her and others
standing outside: ``We shot him. We shot him.''
   During the interview with Jack Thomas of KUOP radio in Stockton,
Ms. Serrano-Sewell admitted she altered her initial description of
the dress, but blamed police harassment for the change.
   ``There was a lot of badgering that was going on,'' she said.
``I was just 20 years old, and I became unglued.''
   Police files of the Kennedy investigation released in Sacramento
on Tuesday reported that Ms. Serrano-Sewell fully recanted the
story about two weeks after Kennedy's June 5 assassination, which
came moments after he had declared victory in the California
presidential primary.
   ``The whole thing was a lie,'' the files quoted Ms.
Serrano-Sewell as saying on June 20, 1968.
   However, she now says that lengthy grilling in a police
interrogation room, where white polka-dot dresses were tacked all
over the walls, caused her to give in.
   ``I said what they wanted me to say,'' Ms. Serrano-Sewell said.
``I don't want to have to go through that again, that kind of
everyday harassment _ being put in a room for hours with polka-dot
dresses all around you. It was just a bad scene.''
   She said she felt singled out for police scrutiny although she
said four other witnesses standing outside the hotel that night
reported similar accounts of a fleeing young woman.
   The recently released police files said Ms. Serrano-Sewell
recanted her story after failing a lie detector test. Police
canceled an all-points bulletin seeking a woman in a white
polka-dot dress the next day.

   An ersatz Smokey the Bear tried to resign
in protest of road building and clear-cutting on national forest
land, but he was turned down by the U.S. Forest Service.
   ``Smokey offered the resignation but we didn't accept it,'' said
Hal Salwasser, acting deputy forester for the service's western
region, after a 25-minute conference with bear-costumed protester
Daniel Barron.
   The attempted resignation of Smokey was part of a peaceful
demonstration Thursday outside the regional offices of the Forest
Service in downtown San Francisco by Earth First!, a radical
environmental group.
   Other demonstrations in observance of the 150th birthday of
Sierra Club founder John Muir were held in Seattle, Portland, Los
Angeles, at Sequoia National Forest Headquarters in Porterville,
and at the Forest Service headquarters of Six Rivers National
Forest in Eureka.
   In Muir's honor, Thursday was proclaimed by protesters as a
National Day of Outrage'' at forest policies.
   About 150 people marched in front of the headquarters building
in San Francisco, chanting and toting signs roughly along the same
lines: ``No More Clear Cutting, No More Roads On Our Public
Lands,'' and ``Only You Can Prevent Clear Cutting.'' Clear-cutting
is the total clearance of an area.
   The Forest Service calls logging ``harvesting,'' part of a
program of ``intelligent and sound land management,'' the service's
regional timber management director Ray Weinmann told reporters at
an impromptu news conference.
   At Porterville, 18 Earth First! members handed out fliers that
accused the Forest Service of degrading the land with
timber-cutting and forest roads.
   At Eureka, about a dozen members protested for about three
hours, focusing on the ``GO-Road'' that runs for a portion through
the forest from Gasquet to Orleans. Construction of an incompleted
portion has been approved by the U.S. Supreme Court after a lengthy
court fight.
   In Los Angeles, about two dozen members of Earth First! dressed
as trees during a demonstration at the Federal Building downtown to
protest the cutting of timber on public lands.
   About 30 Earth First! members demonstrated in Seattle outside
the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest office, including yet
another protester in a Smokey outfit and another decked out as
Robin Hood.
   Jim Unterwegner, a Forest Service spokesman in Portland, said
about 100 protesters chanted and marched on the Pacific Northwest
regional office there.

<HEAD>City Crew Donates Money So Woman Can Keep Water Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four crewmen on a utility truck were
sent to Bertha Shefton's rundown house to disconnect her water, but
instead they chipped in to help pay her overdue bill of $103.44.
   Ms. Shefton, 80, lives with her granddaughter, a diabetic
amputee who requires kidney dialysis three times a week. They had
fallen behind on their bills, even before someone stole their
monthly Social Security checks from the mailbox three weeks ago.
   ``There was something very special about her,'' crew member Lyn
Roberts said. ``We just couldn't leave her in that condition.''
   ``I had $25 in my pocket,'' said Joe Johnson, another crew
member. ``She needed it badder than I did.''
   The crew had shut off the water and driven a half-mile away
before turning back to do their good deed Thursday.
   ``It brought tears to my eyes,'' Ms. Shefton said. ``With the
condition we was in, I don't know what we would have done.''
   Ms. Shefton said her money problems began after the death of her
husband, Izell, last June. She and her granddaughter, Mercedine
Pugh, 37, have a monthly income of $952.
   The city crew, which shuts off the water of dozens of delinquent
customers in a typical week, was struck by Ms. Shefton's
understanding attitude.
   ``She just asked for a minute to fill up the bathtub and a few
pots and pans,'' Johnson said. ``It really touched me.''
   The crew came up with about $50 and radioed City Hall to ask if
it would be enough to restore service. After some debate, officials
agreed. In the meantime, five co-workers heard the chatter over the
radio and donated enough to pay the rest of her water bill.
   ``I've never heard the guys talk like that before,'' said Bennie
Scott, a department supervisor who gave $33.44. ``I knew she must
be worth it.''

<TEXT>
   Members of community organizations that promote
minority hiring banded together to extort payoffs from contractors
by threatening to stop or disrupt work, authorities charged.
   ``They wanted their wallets stuffed,'' said U.S. Attorney Andrew
J. Maloney. ``This was not a civil rights movement, as far we can
tell.''
   He announced Thursday that 13 people, most of them leaders and
associates of the minority organizations, were charged with
extorting more than $112,000 since 1981. Nine were charged with
conspiracy to commit extortion and four with extortion.
   The charges resulted in part from a seven-year-old undercover
investigation which included the formation of a contracting company
run by agents, said Kenneth Frawley, commissioner of the city
Department of Investigation.
   A portion of the payoffs was provided by the undercover agents
with city funds, Frawley said. That money was not recovered.
   Frawley said that during the investigation some of the
defendants told undercover officers, ``This is not about jobs here,
this is about money.''
   Maloney noted that the government was not alleging wrongdoing by
any organization, but rather that the individual members abused
their positions.
   The defendants were allegedly affiliated with five groups
identified as Free At Last, Link Community Construction Workers
Inc., FAIR, South Brooklyn Construction Workers and Brooklyn Fight
Back.
   Ten of the 13 defendants were arrested Wednesday and Thursday.
The other three remain at large. If convicted, the defendants would
face a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail.
   The indictment charges that certain organization members
demanded a total of $100,000 in payoffs, which frequently took the
form of wages to be paid for a no-show ``labor coordinator,'' from
numerous construction sites.
   If the demands were not met, the defendants threatened
demonstrations or use of force to disrupt or stop work at the
sites, the indictment charged.

<HEAD>PTL Seeking Money From Jessica Hahn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PTL ministry is suing Jessica Hahn to
regain money in a trust account that was promised to her in
exchange for her silence about a 1980 sexual encounter with former
PTL leader Jim Bakker.
   The financially troubled television ministry says in a lawsuit
filed this week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbia that Hahn
broke her part of the bargain by talking publicly about the
encounter that led to Bakker's downfall.
   The suit also seeks reimbursement of any excess legal fees paid
to California lawyer Scott Furstman, who managed the trust fund for
PTL. Furstman has agreed to that, the suit said.
   Hahn, contacted by telephone at the Playboy mansion in Los
Angeles, said Thursday she doesn't want the money. But she said she
wants to make sure it's used properly.
   She said PTL lawyers have told her about $160,000 remains in the
account. She said she refused the attorneys' request that she sign
a contract returning the money to PTL.
   ``I would like to do what is right,'' Hahn said. ``But at this
point I don't know if what they're doing is right. ... I didn't
know if it was in my best interest to sign something like this.
   ``I fell for this once and I'm not going to fall for it twice,
signing something I don't know what I was signing.''
   In November 1984, Hahn signed a document recanting accusations
against Bakker. But she said she was forced into signing it and
that a former PTL board member gave her $10,000 after she did.
   The trust account was formed in February 1985 after Hahn
reasserted her complaints.
   PTL agreed to pay her $115,000 in cash and to establish a trust
fund of $150,000. She was to receive monthly interest payments from
the fund for 20 years, after which she would receive the principal.
   In return, Hahn agreed not to speak publicly about her tryst
with Bakker.
   The lawsuit claims Playboy magazine paid Hahn $1 million for her
story and photographs. It concludes that ``by virtue of the terms
of the settlement agreement and Hahn's decision to publicize for
financial gain her version of the Dec. 6, 1980 incident ... the
funds in the Jessica Hahn Trust ... should be restored to PTL in
their entirety.''
   Hahn disputed PTL's contention that she had broken her promise.
She said evangelist Jerry Falwell, who assumed control of PTL after
Bakker resigned in March 1987, cut off payments to her in April
1987.

   The man who threatened to free a
500-pound Bengal tiger on the Louisiana State University campus
snapped from pressure but deserves compassion, says basketball
Coach Dale Brown.
   Brown signed the $10,000 bail bond Thursday to free Moacyr
``Gato'' Cezar, 48, who locked himself in the outer cage of the LSU
mascot Wednesday and remained for four hours, threatening to free
the tiger unless he got a job.
   Jose Vargas, a basketball player from the Dominican Republic,
talked Cezar out of the cage.
   Cezar, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, had been serving as a supervisor of
the LSU basketball dormitory for room and board while taking
courses to improve his English.
   Cezar was never in danger from the tiger, a 13-year-old named
Mike IV.
   ``What happened to Gato could have happened to any of us. His
personal problems were overwhelming and he snapped,'' Brown told a
news conference after Cezar was freed from jail and taken to a
hospital for psychiatric testing.
   The Baton Rouge district attorney's office said no final
decision had been made on charges, but that consideration would be
given to the fact that the university itself does not plan to press
charges.
   ``The doctor says he is OK and he will soon return to Brazil and
an uncertain future,'' said Brown, adding that Cezar plans to
return home voluntarily.
   Cezar was befriended by the globetrotting Brown last summer in
Sao Paulo. ``He wanted to come back and learn English and more
about basketball.''
   Cezar's temporary visa was expiring, he wanted a work permit and
just couldn't take the pressure anymore, said Brown.
   At one point, some of the students who watch the man in the cage
chanted, ``Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _ the cry used at LSU sporting
events when opposing teams enter.
   ``To those of you who shouted `Tiger bait,' what can I say?''
Brown said. ``May you never experience sadness and loneliness, and
may you find a love that you couldn't give last night.''

<HEAD>Ligachev Appears at Kremlin Gala After Rumors of Demotion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Yegor K. Ligachev, the Communist Party Politburo
member who has been reported to be in politcal trouble, took part
in a Kremlin gala today.
   There have been reports and rumors Ligachev was reprimanded and
demoted for opposing Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform policies.
   At an evening gathering of the Kremlin leadership to mark the
118th anniversary of the birth of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin,
Ligachev filed into the crowded auditorium of the Palace of
Congresses in his rightful place.
   Ligachev, considered the country's No. 2 leader, followed
General Secretary Gorbachev, President Andrei A. Gromyko and
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   Gorbachev and Ligachev sat together at the front of the huge
hall and engaged in animated conversation throughout a speech by
candidate member of the Politburo Georgy P. Razumovsky. The speech
was shown on national television.
   Rumors have been spread around the capital this week that
Ligachev was reprimanded by Gorbachev at an extraordinary meeting
of the 13-man Politburo and stripped of responsibility for ideology
and personnel matters _ the tasks usually assigned to the
second-in-command.
   The New York Times, in today's editions, quoted unnamed Soviet
officials as saying Ligachev was all but removed as the Communist
Party's No. 2 leader.
   But the party ideologist traditionally follows the premier in
the official lineup and Ligachev appeared after Ryzhkov during the
gala.
   Ligachev, 67, thought to be more conservative than Gorbachev,
reportedly believes glasnost, or Gorbachev's policy of openness,
has gone too far in denouncing most of the economic and social
policies of the past.
   Because of the the rumors and reports, the gala was watched to
see if Ligachev, who some said was on a long vacation, would show
up.
   The formal arena for changing duties among party secretaries
would be at a Central Committee plenum. But if Ligachev were in
serious political trouble, he would likely take a lower profile
until the next plenary meeting.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told reporters toay
that ``there has been no change in the distribution of duties,''
when asked about official, though anonymous, claims that Alexander
N. Yakovlev stepped up to take over Ligachev's role.
   Perfiliev said there had been no shakeup in the leadership, but
seemed to add as protection that Ligachev was on a ``short
vacation,'' in the event he did not show up at the Kremlin
gathering.
   The alleged internal dispute apparently came to a head over the
past month when an article in defense of late dictator Josef V.
Stalin was published by the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya, then
denounced by the party organ Pravda.
   Ligachev was rumored to have been behind the pro-Stalin letter,
and the Pravda denunciation indicated the party had defined that
theme as beyond the limits of glasnost.
   Despite the much-touted campaign to bring the problems of life
to the forefront, Soviet media never name names when referring to
high-level resistance to Gorbachev's reforms. The official silence
leaves observers to the counsel of sources who often seek to
present the internal conflicts in a light favorable to the official
of their liking.
   Editors and other officials who have periodic contact with top
party officials have been giving conflicting hints to Westerners
about the fate of Ligachev, a stocky, white-haired figure with a
booming voice.

<HEAD>Official Chinese Agency Comments on Bush and Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Xinhua News Agency said today the
U.S. presidential campaign is shaping up as a battle between Vice
President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   An analysis written by Bao Guanfren said the Republican Bush has
the advantage of an early grip on his nomination by ``an
essentially united party'' while Dukakis' nomination as the
Democratic candidate is likely but not yet assured.
   Bush ``can benefit from a rather sound economy, the Reagan
heritage of lowering inflation and unemployment, negotiating new
arms agreements with the Soviet Union and his experience in
government and foreign affairs,'' it said.
   ``However, staying for more than seven years under the tutelage
of President Reagan, he has had little in the way of his own
record. His loyalty to Reagan has earned him the bad reputation of
`wimp,' and the Iran-Contra scandal is still shadowing him.
   ``Dukakis has even more troubles. His nomination is very likely
but still not as assured as Bush's. Whether (Jesse) Jackson gives
him the freedom to pick the kind of running mate he really wants is
still a problem.
   ``Dukakis was unknown nationally six months ago after nine years
as governor of Massachusetts. His only legacy is as the architect
of the `Massachusetts miracle,' and he uses his state as an example
of the economic development, housing and education reforms he
promises for the nation.
   ``His front-runner status has been achieved not through
overwhelming support but through a general feeling among Democrats
that, `Ho hum, there's no one better.'''

<HEAD>Man Charged In 1979 Murder Of 12-Year-Old</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly nine years after a boy was stabbed to
death outside Yankee Stadium when he refused to give up his new
bicycle and basketball, police say a suspect has been arrested.
   Pedro Lozada, 26, of Manhattan, was picked out of a lineup
Thursday by several witnesses to the 1979 murder of 12-year-old
Tireak Ghandy.
   ``This case really bothered a lot of people,'' said Detective
John Hennessy of the 44th Precinct. ``Some of them said they lived
with it too long.''
   Witnesses had told police at the time that they saw a boy of
about 16 stab Ghandy once in the chest at 8:30 p.m. on July 30,
1979, on the pedestrian mall at the stadium. He then pulled the
ball from Ghandy's hands and took the bicycle.
   A break in the case came when a man under arrest provided a name
during routine questioning. Then, for 18 months, Hennessy and
Detective Gerard Dunn went through the painstaking task of tracking
down the witnesses, many of whom had moved.
   Lozada was arrested Wednesday night while visiting his parole
officer and charged with second-degree murder, first-degree robbery
and possession of a deadly weapon, police said.
   He had served three years in state prison for possession of
stolen property.
   ``Even from the beginning all the detectives who worked on it,
their hearts went out to the mother because she was so nice and so
hard-working,'' Hennessy said. ``He was her only child.''

   Delayed by rain and heavy traffic on her
way to a local hospital, a nurse delivered her own baby while her
husband and three children watched.
   David Adam Durr was born about 8 a.m. Thursday in the cab of a
pickup truck five miles shy of Community Hospital Medical Center.
   Maria McDonald-Durr, who works as nursing supervisor at the
hospital, was being driven to the center by her husband when
rush-hour traffic was slowed by rain.
   ``We never stopped,'' said her husband, Leonard Durr. ``Missy
not only delivered, she caught him, as a midwife or a doctor would
have caught him. I said, `Great catch, Mama _ and good delivery!'''
   After the birth, Mrs. Durr, 34, placed the baby on her stomach
and covered him with a hand-crocheted blanket the couple had
intended to bring him home in.
   ``Leonard could see what was going on, and as long as the baby
kept breathing and crying, we weren't too concerned,'' she said.
   The child, the couple's fourth, measured 20 inches long and
weighed 7 pounds and 15 ounces.

   White men wearing Nazi-style
uniforms left a pig's head in front of a synagogue during the night
on the 99th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, a Jewish community
leader said today.
   A pig's head also was found in front of a Jewish club in Durban.
   In another incident, witnesses said a man in a uniform threw a
smoke grenade into a mosque near Johannesburg Wednesday night,
injuring two worshipers.
   Six white men drove up to the synagogue at about 11 p.m.
Wednesday and placed at the entrance a pig's head covered with
swastikas, said Josh Goldberg, director of the Council of Jewry in
Natal Province, quoting witnesses.
   Earlier that night, the Jewish club celebrated Israel's 40th
anniversary and a pig's head was left there soon after the event
ended, Goldberg said. Hitler was born April 20, 1889.
   One witness, Deborah Solomon, described the men in the synagogue
incident as wearing ``Nazi-type uniforms with swastika-like
armbands, white shirts, black ties, black uniforms and boots.''
   Goldberg said he did know who the men were.
   President P.W. Botha later condemned neo-Nazism, saying in
Parliament, ``South Africa will have to rid itself of these people
if we want to get somewhere.
   ``I think it is only sick people who can take a pig's head and
place it in front of the holy shrine of others,'' Botha said. He
said cabinet ministers in charge of law enforcement and
registration of political parties would investigate.
   Wynand Malan, an independent member of Parliament, urged police
today to find and arrest those responsible for the Durban incidents
and the grenade throwing. He said South Africa's future lay ``in
the rich diversity in our society.''
   A member of the Moslem congregation at Heidelberg, an industrial
community, said two worshipers were injured when a man in a uniform
threw the grenade during an observance of the holy month of Ramadan.
   The independent South African Press Association reported members
of the Afrikaner National Socialists celebrated the Nazi leader's
birthday Wednesday in Pretoria, the capital.
   The agency quoted Koos Vermeulen, leader of the group, as
saying, ``People tend to get upset when people who believed in
Hitler's greatness honor him. So we conduct our celebrations in
secret.''
   Although South Africa sided with the Allies during both world
wars, there was sympathy for the German and Nazi causes among the
Dutch-, French- and German-descended Afrikaners who form South
Africa's dominant white community.
   About 110,000 of South Africa's 5 million whites are Jewish.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice in governmental
affairs under the nation's system of racial separation, known as
apartheid.

<HEAD>Magazine Says French Hostages In Lebanon To Be Released Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa said today
that contacts were under way between France and Iran for the
release of three Frenchmen held hostage in Lebanon.
   A West German television station, meanwhile, reported that
Western diplomats negotiating with the kidnappers of Western
hostages in Lebanon were making progress in efforts to win the
captives' release.
   Ash-Shiraa said Paris and Tehran had agreed on the release of
two French hostages in Lebanon in return for ``the release of
Iranian assets frozen in France in addition to a $1 billion
compensation to Iran.''
   The magazine apparently was referring to full repayment of a
billion-dollar loan made by the late Shah of Iran to France and
disputed interest which could amount to an additional billion
dollars.
   ``Last minute snags delayed the release,'' the magazine said
without further elaboration.
   There had been reports of an imminent French hostage release
earlier this month. But the April 5 hijack of a Kuwait Airways
jetliner by Shiite extremists apparently delayed the negotiations.
   Ash Shiraa aslo indicated that France's insistance on the
release of a third French hostage was delaying implementation of
the alleged deal.
   ``The deal (to release the two) was not carried out pending
completion of negotiations for the release of a third French
hostage in Lebanon,'' the report said. It did not disclose further
details.
   The magazine Ash-Shiraa gained international fame when it broke
the story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in 1986.
   The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a group of
Lebanese Shiite extremists, holds French diplomats Marcel Carton
and Marcel Fontaine in addition to journalist Jean-Paul Kaufmann.
The three were kidnapped in 1985 in Moslem west Beirut.
   The West German SAT 1 television station, quoting unidentified
sources, also said that missing Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite
was being held in a Beirut school cellar, guarded by Iranian
diplomatic employees.
   Western diplomats are negotiating with Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian
radical Shiite Moslem group believed to be holding Western
hostages, SAT 1 said. It said progress was being made, especially
in the case of Rudolf Cordes, who is reported to be seriously ill.
   Cordes, a West German businessman, was kidnapped in Beirut in
January 1987. Aother West German, Alfred Schmidt, was kidnapped
days later but was released last September.
   Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in
Lebanon.
   Terry Anderson, 40, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been held
the longest.

   Human bones discovered in the ceiling of
a downtown 19th century building came from more than one body and
may be as old as the building, authorities said.
   ``I wouldn't say that unless I was quite sure,'' said Monroe
County medical examiner Dr. Nicholas Forbes, who conducted a
preliminary examination of the bones found by a construction crew.
   Forbes said Thursday that he found duplicate bones which could
not have come from the same body, although that's about all he was
able to tell.
   The bones, a shoulder blade and parts of legs and arms, will be
sent to Syracuse to be examined by forensic anthropologist William
Rodriguez in the Onondaga County medical examiner's office.
   ``When you start talking about the co-mingling of individuals it
gets a little complicated,'' Forbes said. ``So we need someone who
has some expertise in this area.''
   That examination is expected to take a few weeks, Forbes said.
   Jeff Abel, a worker for E.J.M. Excavating, made the first
discovery _ part of a leg and foot _ while he and other workers
were pulling down a ceiling Wednesday.
   ``It was very intact, toes, toenail, skin on the toe. ... It was
just like spooky, sort of ghoulish, like you found somebody's
grave,'' Abel said.
   Forbes said the bones retained some ``mummified soft tissue.''
   Workers have not discovered a skull or rib cage. Police believe
they've found all the bones that could have been in the building.

   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis said today ``I think it would be a tragedy'' if President
Reagan vetoes the major trade bill heading for passage in Congress.
   Earlier, at a rally at a Ford plant, the Massachusetts governor
said the bill ``is the right thing to do and it's the fair thing to
do.''
   It would be tragic, he told reporters at the airport, if the
bill were vetoed ``because of a mild plant-closing provision.''
   The bill, which won easy House passage Thursday and seems
destined for similar Senate action next week, would overhaul the
nation's foreign trade laws.
   Reagan said Thursday he will veto it if it arrives on his desk
with a provision to require all but the smallest employers to give
60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   Dukakis said a notification law in Massachusetts had helped his
state save 20,000 jobs by enabling government officials to be aware
of business problems and to work to resolve them.
   Thursday night, Dukakis, acting ever more like the Democratic
presidential nominee, said he wouldn't have a White House spokesman
who makes up presidential quotes ``as he goes along.'' That was a
reference to former Reagan spokesman Larry Speakes, who admitted
making up quotes for the president.
   The front-running Democrat, looking to follow his New York
victory with another win Tuesday in Pennsylvania and the week after
in Ohio and Indiana, hit on the themes of rebuilding America's
industrial base as he toured the country's industrial heartland.
   ``Over the past decade, in communities all over Ohio and
Pennsylvania and Indiana, we've seen the same kind of pain and
agony and uncertainty that we lived through in New England during
the '50s and '60s and early '70s,'' Dukakis told the City Club of
Cleveland on Thursday night. ``I've seen what happens when good,
decent, hard-working people lose their jobs.''
   Dukakis emphasized his themes of reinvesting in America, support
for plant-closing legislation and increased excellence in education
as he planned to visit a Ford plant near Toledo today and a steel
mill in Pittsburgh.
   ``We're going to encourage management and labor to work
together, not as enemies but as allies, to out-hustle, out-produce,
out-sell and out-compete every nation on earth,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts politician has opened up a lead over Jesse
Jackson, the only remaining active rival for the nomination, in The
Associated Press delegate count in the past two weeks. His big
victory in New York sparked talk that the nomination is all but his.
   In his Cleveland speech during a campaign day marred by plane
breakdowns, Dukakis took Speakes to task for making up quotes for
President Reagan on at least two occasions.
   Speakes revealed the actions in his just-published book
``Speaking Out.'' The furor over the disclosure cost Speakes his
public relations job at a Wall Street firm.
   ``I have a quaint policy as governor: no press release will ever
go out of my office in my name without me reviewing it first,''
Dukakis said. ``If I'm ever president of the United States, I can
assure you I will have a press secretary that reports on what I say
and does not compose things as he goes along.''
   He added: ``And I can't imagine having a press secretary who was
feeding quotes to the press that I hadn't uttered and approved.''
   As he has in the past week, Dukakis directed his fire at the
Reagan administration, not at Jackson.
   ``We have a Labor Department and an NLRB (National Labor
Relations Board) that won't stand up for America because we have
got an attorney general who couldn't tell the difference between
antitrust and antifreeze,'' Dukakis said in Cleveland.

   Rescue ships and planes searched
the waters of the north Atlantic today for survivors of a tanker
than broke in half and burst into flames.
   Hopes that some of the crew escaped the flaming tanker were
buoyed when rescue ships reported a life raft was missing from the
ship, said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Larry Lawrence.
   Authorities do not know the origin of the tanker, what it was
carrying or how many people were on board.
   ``They are scouring the area around both sections looking for
survivors,'' said Petty Officer Brad Terrill of the Coast Guard in
New York. ``Apparently both sections, although they are in flames,
appear to be floating.''
   The research ship Hudson spotted the burning tanker at about
midnight, 370 miles southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, the
Search and Rescue Co-ordination Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
reported.
   The Hudson joined by an Italian ship, the Italica, in looking
for survivors, officials said.
   Two Canadian Aurora patrol aircraft were joining the search,
Canadian officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard also dispatched a
plane and Terrill said the Canadian fisheries patrol vessel Cape
Rober was steaming into the area.
   An earlier report that an empty lifeboat was seen floating
nearby was erroneous, according to the Hudson's commanding officer,
Terrill said.
   ``We don't know the size, how many people on board, or even the
name'' of the tanker, said Lt. Norman Selley, also at the
operations center in New York.
   Terrill said the Hudson has not reported any pollution in the
waters around the tanker.
   In April 1987, the Hudson dropped scientific work to become
involved in a dramatic rescue off the coast of Newfoundland. The
ship's crew saved the 24-man crew of the sinking Skipper I, a
Panamanian-registered freighter.

   Large numbers of Contras have been retreating
across the Nicaraguan border into Honduras because of an acute food
shortage in rebel camps in Nicaragua, a leader of the insurgent
forces said today.
   No U.S. aid has been sent to the insurgents in Nicaragua since
Feb. 29, and $47.9 million in humanitarian aid approved by Congress
cannot be delivered to rebel forces there until Contra and
Sandinista negotiators make progress in cease-fire talks.
   A breakthrough is not expected before next month because the
talks have been suspended until April 28.
   Alfredo Cesar, a member of the Contra political leadership, told
reporters the number of rebels on the Honduran side of the border
has swelled in recent weeks to 3,000 to 4,000 because of the food
shortages in Nicaragua. It was not clear, however, how many rebels
were in that area prior to the recent exodus from Nicaragua.
   Rebel forces in jungle and mountainous regions in Nicaragua face
``a very difficult situation,'' Cesar said. He added that the
troops will be ordered to return to Nicaragua once U.S.-sponsored
food shipments inside Nicaragua begin.
   The food situation in Contra camps on the Honduran side of the
border improved this week with the delivery of 69,000 tons of rice,
beans and other items acquired with the U.S. aid money, an Agency
for International Development official told reporters Thursday.
   The shipments were sent from the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa
after being inspected by independent observers, including Honduran
clergymen, to ensure that the deliveries contained no lethal
equipment, the official said.
   The legislation approving the aid package barred military aid to
the Contras.
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, said that based on
talks he had last week with Contra leaders, the food situation for
the estimated 12,000 rebels stationed inside Nicaragua ``is getting
very desperate.''
   Another official said ``more than a few hundred'' Contras have
crossed the border into Honduras over the past several weeks to
escape the food shortages in Nicaragua.
   Many of those still in Nicaragua are beginning to sell off what
few assets they have for food while others are buying on credit,
promising merchants repayment once deliveries begin on the U.S.
humanitarian aid package approved three weeks ago, the official
said.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras reached a temporary truce last
March 23 that allows for humanitarian aid for the rebels once they
are settled in seven mutually agreed cease-fire zones.
   But talks on establishing ground rules for the zones are at an
impasse, leaving rebel forces in a precarious position.
   The official said there are one or two known instances in which
rebels have used their weapons to take food, and more such
incidents can be expected if the talks drag on inconclusively.
   The Sandinistas have a big advantage because, in contrast to the
rebels, the government is able to feed its troops without
restrictions, he said.
   ``The playing field isn't quite level in this negotiation,'' the
official added.
   Asked whether the Sandinistas, mindful of Contra food shortages,
are using delaying tactics in the negotiations, the official said,
``Not yet. But if it ... drags on, you're going to have to raise
that question.''
   Congress imposed an aid cutoff on Feb. 29 but approved the
humanitarian aid package after the breakthrough in the
Sandinista-Contra talks a month ago.
   The package contains $17.7 million for food, clothing, shelter
and medical supplies and medical services. The remainder is
earmarked for treating children who are victims of the war and for
verifying compliance with the agreement.
   The Sandinstas and the Contras are trying to reach agreement not
only on ground rules for cease-fire zones but also terms for a
permanent peace settlement.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 9th-10th grafs, `Born Itek ...,' to explain what I.A.L.

   Oscar-winning screenwriter I.A.L.
Diamond, who collaborated with director Billy Wilder on some of
Hollywood's most popular films, has died at age 67.
   Diamond, who won an Oscar in 1960 for the screenplay ``The
Apartment,'' died Thursday at his Beverly Hills home of cancer. His
longtime agent, Irving Lazar, said Diamond had been ailing for
several months.
   Lazar said he introduced Diamond to Wilder, launching a 30-year
partnership that produced some of Hollywood's most memorable
movies, starting in 1957 with ``Love in the Afternoon,'' which
starred Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn.
   Diamond's work with Wilder also included ``Some Like It Hot,''
with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe; ``The Apartment''
which featured Lemmon; and ``The Fortune Cookie,'' which teamed
Lemmon with Walter Matthau.
   Diamond and Wilder collaborated on the 1974 remake of Ben
Hecht's classic Chicago newspaper tale, ``The Front Page,'' which
again teamed Lemmon and Matthau.
   Besides his Academy Award for ``The Apartment,'' Diamond also
received Oscar nominations for ``Some Like it Hot'' and ``The
Fortune Cookie.''
   He also wrote the 1969 screen adaptation of ``Cactus Flower''
under the name Abe Burrows.
   Wilder once remarked of his longtime collaborator, ``If I ever
lost this guy, I'd feel like Abercrombie without Fitch.''
   Born Itek Dommnici in Ungheni, Romania, on June 27, 1920,
Diamond came to the United States at age 9. He adopted the pen name
I.A.L. Diamond _ the initials stood for Interscholastic Algebra
League in reference to his early interest in mathematics.
   As a youth, he won a three-state math competition that sent him
to Columbia University, where he majored in math.
   At Columbia, he wrote four annual student revues and edited the
university paper, said his wife, Barbara.
   Paramount Studios brought Diamond to Hollywood in 1940. His
first screen credit came four years later for ``Murder in the Blue
Room.''
   In later years, Diamond was critical of writers he said only
used the profession as a stepping stone to the director's chair.
   ``There are no writers left in this business,'' he told People
magazine last year. ``There are only would-be directors (who) have
learned that the best way to get a crack at directing ... is to
write a script. But most don't have the vaguest talent as writers.
   ``They see writing as a phase they have to pass through, like
adolescent acne.''
   In addition to his wife, Diamond is survived by a son, a
daughter and one grandchild.

   Prosecutors have decided not to file charges
against a WCBS-TV reporter who registered several times for this
week's primary election to demonstrate the potential for vote fraud.
   Reporter Barbara Nevins said Wednesday night she had registered
to vote in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Nassau
County using a series of names and friends' addresses. She said she
voted only once.
   Betty Dolen, executive director of the Board of Elections, who
was interviewed by Ms. Nevins, said she referred the case to
prosecutors because it is illegal to give false information to
election officials or to register falsely.
   The Manhattan district attorney's office decided Thursday not to
file charges against Ms. Nevins, said Gerald McKelvey, spokesman
for District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
   U.S. Rep. Bill Green criticized the board for seeking
prosecution of Ms. Nevins.
   ``A reporter's duty is to alert the public to the realities of
life,'' he said. ``Killing the messenger does not negate the
message.
   ``The board should determine whether the potential for fraud _
multiple registration and voting _ is enough to require changes in
the system. ... Seeking to prosecute the reporter is unjustified
and darn foolish.''
   Mrs. Dolen said Ms. Nevins admitted in her news report that she
had committed Class E felonies. ``What she did is against the law
and I gave it to the district attorney,'' she said.
   ``I was disturbed by the attempt to prosecute me,'' Ms. Nevins
said. ``I thought the response was inappropriate. When we showed
Mrs. Dolen a flaw in the system, the response should have been,
`There's something wrong; let's fix it.' Instead, she turned the
tables and pointed a finger at me.''
   Mrs. Dolen said fraudulent registration is rare, but cautioned
that breaking the law on television could encourage others to do it.
   ``I told her, `If you go on television, people who have never
thought about doing something like this will think about doing so.'
I think she's really out of line,'' she said.
   Ms. Nevins' report did not suggest that widespread fraud was
committed in Tuesday's primary, but stressed that a campaign to rig
a local election might work.

<HEAD>Psychiatrist Curbs Violence on Children's TV Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Captain Power'' cartoon series,
television's first ``interactive'' program, has hired a
psychiatrist in response to concerns the syndicated show is too
violent for young viewers.
   The interactive format of ``Captain Power,'' which has been
criticized by the National Coalition on Television Violence, allows
children to ``shoot'' villains by aiming a special toy gun at
bright orange dots on the screen.
   Psychiatrist Carole Lieberman was retained by ``Captain Power''
Executive Producer Gary Goddard after she independently studied the
program and complained about its violent content.
   ``When you have a high action show, it's important to balance
the action and adventure with an awareness that our audience
includes young viewers,'' Goddard said.
   ``Captain Power'' was the top-rated weekly children's syndicated
series during the November 1987 sweeps period, according to A.C.
Nielsen Co., and is the fourth-rated overall children's syndicated
program. It is currently seen in more than 200 U.S. markets and 46
foreign countries.
   ``The image of a kid coming home to an empty house, sitting in a
dark room and shooting at a television set is a very disturbing
one,'' said Lieberman, who has served as a psychiatric script
consultant on more than 100 TV and movie productions.
   ``There are studies, 43 out of 47 to be exact, that show when a
child is exposed to violent toys or media, the child becomes more
aggressive in the period of time following,'' she said.
   Lieberman said the studies also found the more aggressive a
child is when he is young, the more likely he will stay that way as
a teen-ager and as an adult. ``There are great implications from
this exposure to violence.''
   Upon reviewing scripts and tapes of the show, Lieberman _ to her
admitted surprise _ discovered many ``positive things'' about the
series. She noted the program demonstrated ``teamwork and values,''
particularly in each episode's secondary storyline.
   The psychiatrist suggested that the orange dot targets be moved
as often as possible away from the bodies of the villains to
inanimate objects, such as computer pads. This allows children to
``do something productive'' in aiding Captain Power's fight for
good rather than promoting violence against others, she said.
   Lieberman also said the series will be decreasing the amount and
length of violence by trimming the running time of the battle
scenes.
   ``My role in `Captain Power' is not that of a censor,'' insisted
Lieberman. ``I want to work with the writers and creative team to
enhance the characters. Human elements and positive stories don't
have to take a second place to action, nor do you have to sacrifice
any excitement.''

   Georgia Southwestern College announced
today it has taken steps to fire an English professor accused of
making a racial slur against a student.
   College President William Capitan on Thursday issued a formal
letter of intent to start dismissal proceedings against professor
Allen Towery, said school spokesman Wes Wicker.
   He said Towery will have 10 days to respond and is entitled to a
formal public hearing.
   Freshman Ginevra Dennis complained that Towery called her a
``black bitch'' on March 7 when she talked to him about withdrawing
from his class.
   Towery, a tenured professor who has taught at the school for 18
years, was suspended with pay pending an investigation of the
matter.
   Towery said Ms. Dennis, an 18-year-old psychology major from
Atlanta, had accused him of being a racist when he refused to let
her withdraw from his class with a passing grade instead of a
failing grade.
   A faculty committee investigated the incident and presented its
report to Capitan on April 8.
   A fellow faculty member who overheard the March 7 exchange told
school officials in a letter that Towery refused to let Ms. Dennis
withdraw with a passing grade because she had a failing average on
her essays.
   Ms. Dennis accused Towery of racism, but he denied the
accusation and their conversation became ``increasingly heated,''
said the letter from associate professor Shirley D. Litwhiler. She
acknowledged that she heard Towery make the racial remark, but said
she believed it was made ``in a state of obvious exasperation.''

   Hundreds of Moslem worshipers vowing to avenge
the death of a PLO leader clashed with Israeli soldiers today after
prayers at mosques in Jerusalem and in the occupied Gaza Strip.
Israeli troops killed one Arab and wounded 10.
   Six Arabs were hit by rubber bullets and five police injured by
stones in the clash inside the compound of Jerusalem's sacred Dome
of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques, Israel radio and witnesses said.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, Mohammed Fayez Abu Ali,
25, died of a gunshot wound to the head, Nassr Hospital officials
said.
   Curfews remained in effect today in 22 refugee camps and cities
in the occupied territories, affecting some 400,000 Palestinian
residents.
   The army also barred Arab residents of the territories from
entering Israel for a third straight day to try to curb violence on
the Moslem Sabbath. Journalists also were banned from entering most
parts of the territories, occupied by Israel since 1967.
   In Lebanon, Israeli warplanes raided Palestinian guerrilla bases
south of Beirut today, Lebanese police and the Israeli army
reported.
   The police said the main targets of the attack were guerrilla
bases near the town of Barja in the Kharroub region, 15 miles south
of the Lebanese capital.
   Police said they had no immediate reports of casualties.
   The army said its planes returned safely to base.
   At least 48 people have been killed and 63 wounded in the five
previous Israeli raids since Jan. 3.
   The army also said today that Israeli troops and Israeli-allied
militiamen killed six guerrillas in two clashes in southern Lebanon
Wednesday. One militiaman was killed.
   About 200 Palestinian youths emerged from noon prayers at the Al
Omari mosque in Gaza City, throwing rocks at Israeli troops, Arab
witnesses said.
   ``Youths gather, gather because Abu Jihad sacrificed his
blood,'' they chanted.
   The Palestinians were protesting the killing of PLO military
commander Khalil al-Wazir, known as Abu Jihad, who was gunned down
at his home in Tunis, Tunisia, Saturday last week.
   A Tunisian government report blames Israel for killing Wazir,
who grew up in Gaza. Israeli sources also have confirmed Israel
carried out the assassination.
   Troops hurled tear gas canisters and fired live ammunition into
the air to disperse the crowd.
   In the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, troops opened fire
on rock-throwing Arab protesters outside a mosque after noon
prayers, Arab witnesses said.
   Hospital officials said 10 Palestinians were wounded, including
a 9-year-old boy struck in the left hip and right arm.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   On the Temple Mount about 10,000 Palestinians attended services
at the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques, where the prayer
leader urged the crowd to persist in protests against the Israelis.
   After services, hundreds of worshipers carrying black banners of
mourning and outlawed Palestinian flags hurled rocks at a police
station outside the mosques. Israel radio and witnesses said the
police fired rubber bullets, hitting six Arabs and five officers
were injured.
   ``With our spirit and our blood, we will avenge Abu Jihad,''
shouted some of the protesters.
   The clash on Temple Mount, known in Arabic as Harim es-Sharif,
or Noble Enclosure, was the most serious since Jan. 15 when riot
police fired tear gas on the compound. In that incident, 80 to 100
Palestinians were treated for the effects of tear gas, and one
police officer was knifed.
   According to PLO orders contained in an underground leaflet,
today and Sunday were set aside as days of prayer for Abu Jihad,
and Saturday is to be a ``Day of Rage.''
   The leaflets bearing Wazir's picture ordered Palestinians to
step up attacks with ``stones, petrol bombs, metal balls and
slingshots'' to avenge the PLO leader's death.
   Since the Dec. 8 start of the anti-occupation protests, 169
Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed. Today's death was
not included in the toll.

   The FBI warned reputed mob chief John Gotti last
fall that a fellow mobster had put out a contract on his life,
according to a published report.
   The Daily News today quoted unidentified sources in a story from
Washington as saying that the contract was approved by Vincent
``Chin'' Gigante, reputed boss of the Genovese crime family, after
the slaying of con artist Irwin Schiff.
   Schiff had contacts with both the Genovese family and Gotti's
Gambino family, and his death came at a time of increasing tensions
between the two criminal organizations, according to the News.
   The News sources declined to say how the FBI learned that
Gotti's life was imperiled, but said Bruce Mouw, supervisor of the
FBI squad that tracks the Gambino family, visited Gotti's home to
warn him.
   ``He was surprised, he wasn't very happy, but later he expressed
his thanks,'' the News quoted a Justice Department official as
saying.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Dukakis on trade bill in top 7 grafs, picking up
in 3rd graf pvs, ``The nominee</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, now in a one-on-one fight for
the Democratic presidential nomination, worked to win labor support
in the industrial states of Ohio and Pennsylvania today, with
Dukakis declaring ``it would be a tragedy'' if President Reagan
vetoes a major trade bill.
   Dukakis and Jackson, alone in the race after Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. dropped out Thursday, were to meet tonight in a debate in
Philadelphia, four days before the big Pennsylvania primary.
   Dukakis said at a rally at a Ford plant in Toledo, Ohio, today
that the foreign trade bill is ``the right thing to do and it's the
fair thing to do.''
   It would be tragic, he told reporters later at the airport, if
the bill were vetoed because of a ``mild plant-closing provision.''
   Reagan has said he will veto the bill if it arrives on his desk
with a provision to require all but the smallest employers to give
60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   On Thursday, Dukakis and Jackson both aimed new criticism at
embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Gore abandoned his presidential bid on Thursday, vowing to do
all he could to help put a Democrat in the White House.
   ``The nominee is going to be Michael Dukakis or Jesse Jackson.
I'm going to do everything I can to help them. ...The only man I
want to stop is George Bush,'' Gore said at a Washington news
conference, with his family at his side.
   The Tennessee senator suspended his campaign, technically
remaining a candidate to permit his delegates to attend the
Democratic National Convention. Gore, who had not won a primary or
caucus since Super Tuesday, March 8, ended his effort more than
$1.5 million in debt.
   On the Republican side, Bush was coping with the kind of
scheduling glitch that either of his Democratic rivals would envy _
it looked as if he would clinch the number of delegates needed to
nominate a little sooner than his staff had thought.
   Aides to the vice president had been planning to celebrate the
big moment on May 3, the date of primaries in Ohio, Indiana and the
District of Columbia. But they made it clear that the development
would be more than welcome whenever it came.
   Delegate counts maintained by both The Associated Press and the
Bush campaign indicated Bush could secure the 1,139 needed to
nominate in the next few days. He now has 1,058 to 17 for Pat
Robertson, Bush's only remaining rival, according to the AP count.
   Minnesota Republicans were selecting 15 delegates this week;
Nevada Republicans will choose another 20 on Saturday. And there
are 78 delegates at stake in Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary.
   ``At this point it's pretty much concluded. ... The race is
over,'' Robertson said Thursday in Nevada.
   Even though he has given up on the nomination, the former
television evangelist expressed determination to make his mark on
the GOP. In Nevada, his supporters were dominating the state
convention and bidding for top state party posts.
   Jackson was campaigning today in Pennsylvania, where polls have
suggested he is running well behind Dukakis. In Tuesday's primary,
178 delegates are at stake.
   ``I always run against great odds,'' Jackson said.
   Campaigning in the northwestern Pennsylvania city of Erie,
Jackson courted blue-collar workers with a call for ``economic
justice.''
   ``Profits are up, wages are down, factories are closing, and
workers are abandoned,'' he told a crowd of about 4,000 people in a
downtown park who braved a cold wind off nearby Lake Erie.
   ``Let's rebuild America and put the workers back to work. ...
Don't let the voices of the status quo break your spirit,'' Jackson
said. He also called for changes in the National Labor Relations
Board, saying it should be a mediation service and not ``a
strike-breaking board.''
   Jackson also renewed his criticism of Meese, who is the target
of a yearlong criminal investigation and under pressure from some
quarters to quit. The attorney general said Thursday there is no
factor he knows of ``right now that would cause me to resign.''
   ``I want a Justice Department that stands for justice ... an
attorney general that goes back and forth to court as a prosecutor
for the people and not as a defender for himself,'' Jackson said.
   Dukakis slammed Meese as he campaigned in Cleveland on Thursday.
Ohio's primary follows Pennsylvania's by a week, and offers 159
delegates.
   Like Jackson, Dukakis highlighted labor issues. He was visiting
an auto plant in Ohio and a steel plant in Pennsylvania today.
   ``We have a Labor Department and an NLRB (National Labor
Relations Board) that won't stand up for America because we have
got an attorney general who couldn't tell the difference between
antitrust and antifreeze,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor, bidding for blue-collar support,
added: ``We're going to pass a strong plant-closing law that will
give our workers the notice, the training and the benefits they
need to find new jobs with good wages when plants shut down.''
   Jackson also made his trademark anti-drug appeal as he
campaigned in Philadelphia. Accompanied by Mayor W. Wilson Goode,
he walked through a neighborhood notorious for drug sales and
sounded his familiar ``down with dope, up with hope'' theme.
   Dukakis and Bush were neck-and-neck in national poll results
released today by USA Today and Cable News Network. Dukakis got 45
percent support to Bush's 43 percent _ a difference that fell
within the survey's 3.3 percentage point margin of error.
   Dukakis lost support when Jackson was listed as his
running-mate, with Bush getting 49 percent support to Dukakis's 42
percent. The survey of 900 voters was conducted after Tuesday's New
York primary.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Faces Trial As a Juvenile for Four Ax Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old boy accused of the ax
murders of his parents, brother and sister will be tried as a
juvenile, a judge ruled today.
   Olmsted County Judge Gerard Ring denied a state petition to have
David Brom tried as an adult and ordered that the teen-ager remain
in detention until he can be placed in a juvenile detention home in
Rochester.
   Olmstead County Attorney Ray Schmitz said he would appeal the
ruling to the state Court of Appeals.
   Brom has been charged with murdering his parents, Bernard and
Paulette Brom, and siblings Ricky and Diane, at the family's
Cascade Township home Feb. 18.
   For a juvenile to be tried as an adult in a criminal case, state
law requires the prosecutor to show that the child is not suited to
treatment and is a danger to the community. The judge said neither
standard was met in the Brom case.
   ``I think the facts speak for themselves in terms of his
dangerousness,'' Schmitz said.
   If tried as an adult and found guilty of first-degree murder,
Brom would have been sentenced to life in prison with parole
eligibility in about 17{ years. Under the juvenile court system, if
he is found guilty he will be released when he turns 19 or when he
has been rehabilitated, whichever comes first.
   In a 20-page memorandum accompanying his ruling, the judge
called the case ``one of the most perplexing cases I have been
involved with in my 16 years as a judge.
   ``I am faced with a crime which the prosecution has described as
one of the most vicious and brutal, multiple murders in the history
of the state,'' Ring wrote. ``At the same time I have an accused
who is a child of 16 years, with no prior court record, and who is
described (by a court-appointed psychiatrist) as quite deferential,
polite, and compliant.''
   Ring said he assumed at the beginning of the court proceedings
that Brom would probably be certified as an adult.
   ``In this case, there was no lack of proof that the crime was
terrible. The evidence was graphic and plentiful,'' the judge
wrote. ``However, the evidence as to the child was totally
different.
   ``He was normally funny, to a point of being a problem at times
in class,'' Ring said in his ruling. ``He was never aggressive or
assaultive to anyone's recollection. When slapped by his father, he
did not fight back, even when knocked over a table. He did not
exhibit any signs to most of those who knew him that he could do
the awful things that he apparently did.''
   At a recent reference hearing, psychiatrist Carl Malmquist
testified that Brom suffers from severe depression. He also told
the court that there is no assurance treatment could be complete by
the time he is 19.
   However, psychologist James Gilbertson said the teen could be
successfully treated for his depression within that time frame.
Even if he is not treated, Gilbertson said, the boy would pose no
risk to the general public in almost all circumstances.

<DATELINE>BROOKHAVEN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black leaders say they will end a
10-week boycott of white-owned businesses now that the school board
has decided to reassign a controversial football coach and athletic
director.
   Hollis Rutter, hired from a white private academy, was
reassigned as administrative assistant to the superintendent after
the board voted 4-1 in a special meeting Thursday. He also was
given a two-year contract extension.
   ``We achieved but none of us has won anything,'' the Rev. O.D.
Evans, spokesman for a group called Concerned Citizens, told about
250 jubilant protesters after the five-hour board meeting.
   ``We've all got to live here together,'' he said. ``We've all
got to heal the wounds. We've got to inflict wounds to achieve
something. It's going to take several weeks to get it down where
the pot's not boiling.''
   The board had previously voted 4-1 in support of Rutter.
   Superintendent Goerge Brumfield, who had vowed Wednesday to ride
out the protest, cited a walkout by 197 of the school's 800
students Tuesday as the reason for the sudden turnaround.
   ``Until the students walked out this week, I had no intention
and Coach Rutter had no intention of changing our minds,''
Brumfield said after the meeting.
   Reading from a statement, Brumfield said Rutter ``thought when
the protest first started it would only be for a short duration and
not cause a disruption of the school system and the community. That
proved to be incorrect.''
   Blacks initiated the boycott when Rutter was hired at the
primarily black school in January after spending the previous two
years at all-white Brookhaven Academy. Originally, the boycott
called for black students to boycott extracurricular activities,
but it later was expanded to a general boycott of white-owned
businesses.
   Spring football training, held in February or March by most
schools, was moved to April 25 in an effort to weather the boycott.
   Rutter acknowledged that two of three black baseball players who
started the season dropped off the team in support of the boycott.
Many of the 16-member boys' and 10-member girls' track teams also
quit because of the boycott.

   The U.S. attorney in Philadelphia told a
Senate committee today that the Cosa Nostra is ``on the run'' in
his city, with most of the organized crime leadership under
indictment or in prison.
   However, Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. said that despite the successful
prosecutions, the mob is ``down but not out'' in Philadelphia.
   Testifying before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, Dennis said of his city's organized crime family,
``I don't think it will pass from the scene very easily or very
quickly.''
   Dennis described how the Philadelphia Cosa Nostra turned
increasingly violent after the murder of its former chieftain,
Angelo Bruno, who was shot to death outside his home on March 21,
1980. Bruno's assassination led to a series of mob murders and
subsequent prosecutions and convictions.
   The reputed current boss of the Philadelphia family, Nicodemo
Scarfo, was convicted on extortion and conspiracy charges and
sentenced in August 1987 to 14 years in prison.
   He is on trial in Philadelphia, along with seven Cosa Nostra
members, on charges of killing a former ``capo'' in the Scarfo
organized crime family.
   ``We certainly have the Mafia on the run in Philadelphia and
elsewhere,'' Dennis said.
   At present, most active members of the Philadelphia-South Jersey
Cosa Nostra ``are either under indictment, in custody, or both. If
successful, this series of prosecutions could effectively remove
the LCN (La Cosa Nostra) from criminal activity (in Philadelphia)
for at least the immediate future,'' he said.
   Government crime fighters from New York and New Jersey told the
subcommittee earlier that organized crime is no longer dominated by
gangsters of Italian origin, but by a ``more deadly mixture of
other ethnic immigrants.''
   James R. Zazzali, a member of the New Jersey State Commission of
Investigation, told senators Thursday that of 29 organized crime
organizations operating in his state, ``only seven of these are
Mafia gangs.''
   Zazzali said that ``the problem of newly emerging groups in
5-to-10 years may be the major problem in organized crime.''
   ``What we are experiencing now in New Jersey, in the Northeast,
indeed in every metropolitan area of this nation _ is an evolution
of organized crime from domination largely by gangsters of Sicilian
or other Italian origin since the 1930s to an even more deadly
mixture of other ethnic immigrants,'' he said.
   The groups include American blacks, Asians, Colombians, Cubans,
Jamaicans and Russians, said Zazzali and Ronald Goldstock, director
of the New York Organized Crime Task Force. Motorcycle gangs have
also become a force in organized crime, they said.
   Goldstock said that even now, the ``Colombian drug cartels are a
much greater problem than the traditional La Cosa Nostra.'' He said
organized crime in the United States has changed for these reasons:
   _Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,
a radically new approach that allows prosecutors to focus on the
illegal enterprise as a crime rather than the individuals who run
it.
   Before its enactment in 1970, there was an endless war of
attrition in which one mob leader was simply replaced with another.
Now, entire upper echelons of families have been indicted and
convicted.
   _The breakdown of the code of silence by mobsters faced with
prosecution, forfeiture of assets and incarceration. Several
``elder statesmen'' became media stars, not only through testimony
but by writing books such as ``Man of Honor'' by Joe Bonnano and
``The Last Mafioso'' by Jimmy ``The Weasel'' Fratianno.
   _Disputes between organized crime groups have grown in number
and seriousness as the leadership has become more inexperienced and
unstable.
   Goldstock referred to new organized crime leaders as ``mob
yuppies,'' to whom financial considerations are more important than
the traditional codes of discipline that existed in the old-line
organized crime families.
   ``By the late 1970s, for many family members, traditional values
had been replaced by simple cost-benefit analysis,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu today
rejected as ``crumbs of conscience'' President P.W. Botha's
proposal for giving blacks more political clout in South Africa.
   The black South African cleric accused Botha of making ``slight
adjustments to the evil system'' of apartheid, South Africa's
official policy of separation of the races. Tutu, an outspoken
opponent of apartheid, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.
   It won't help if the white-led government merely ``moved
furniture around, because the room would remain the same,'' Tutu
said on the last day of a four-day visit to Britain.
   Botha told Parliament on Thursday that he would move for black
participation in the electoral college and possibly in the Cabinet
as part of the National Party's program of gradual reform.
   Blacks have demanded full voting rights and abolition of
residential and school segregation.
   Tutu, leader of South Africa's Anglican Church, dismissed
Botha's policy of gradually introducing apartheid reforms.
   ``Reform will not come by `big master' throwing to us crumbs of
conscience that fall from his table,'' the archbishop said. ``It
will happen when all the people in South Africa are able to
determine the menu together when they sit at the same table.''
   Tutu was speaking at ceremony opening a primary school in this
central England industrial city.
   The school is named after Nelson Mandela, the jailed black
activist, prompting protests from local Conservative politicians.
They denounced Mandela as a terrorist and said Tutu had not been
forthright in his condemnation of violence.

   Japanese leaders reacted sharply today to the
approval of an omnibus trade bill by the U.S. House of
Representatives and urged President Reagan to veto it quickly.
   The bill, passed Thursday by a vote of 312-107, targets foreign
markets closed to U.S. industry.
   ``The government of Japan will continue to reiterate its
apprehension to the U.S. side, the administration in particular,
hoping strongly that such a bill will not be enacted,'' Foreign
Minister Sosuke Uno said.
   Hajime Tamura, minister for international trade and industry,
charged that ``anti-Japanese'' sentiment was behind the action,
Kyodo News Service reported.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, in a nationally televised
news conference, warned that Japan-U.S. relations and the world
economy would suffer if the Senate approved the bill.
   He said, however, ``I have strong expectations that in the final
stage the bill will not be passed, the Senate included.''
   The bill, which the Senate was to begin debating Friday,
includes two provisions regarded as threatening to Japanese
business.
   One provision gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
power to decide what constitutes unfair trade practices by another
country, and what to do about it. Another imposes sanctions against
Toshiba Corp. and its subsidiary Toshiba Machine Co., which sold
submarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet Union in violation of a
Western trade agreement on sensitive technology exports.
   Hajime Tamura, minister for international trade and industry,
said he ``deeply regretted'' passage of the omnibus trade bill. ``I
am expecting that President Reagan will take veto action,'' he said.
   ``While I do not think it will be passed in the Senate in the
end, I will urge the U.S. administration (to block the bill) and
await the common sense of the American people,'' Tamura said.
   The bill, shorn of many features criticized as too protective of
U.S. industry, included a controversial item opposed by Reagan. The
provision, which Reagan said will move him to veto the entire bill,
called for advance notice in the event of certain plant closings
and employee layoffs.
   But it lacked what for Japan would have been a more damaging
amendment, which would have imposed sanctions against countries
that the United States judged to have achieved large trade
surpluses through unfair means.

   Hundreds of Iranian mourners shouted

widespread battles in the Persian Gulf with the U.S. Navy this week.
   Young men were shown Thursday on Iranian television waving
banners reading: ``The Persian Gulf will be Reagan's graveyard''

Samuel B. Roberts struck a mine last week.
   The officials said the mines were in an area where a French
warship spotted mines a few days ago. The sources said the mines
carried serial numbers indicating they had been manufactured by
Iran.
   In other developments, Tehran Radio claimed today that Iraq had
used toxic chemicals in two bombing raids in the southern sector of

   When that happens, he says, the nation will be forced into

toward determining the financial shape of the 1990s.

<HEAD>Judge Decides Terlingua Chili Wars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled that the trademark of
Chili Appreciation Society International Inc. belongs to a group
that sought stricter rules in the traditional chili championships
held at Terlingua in West Texas.
   But U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton refused to get involved in
which camp could claim to be the official cookoff of the chili
world.
   Bunon's ruling Thursday means that the name Chili Appreciation
Society International Inc. belongs to a group headed by Ray King of
Poteet.
   Bunton waxed poetic in his opinion, saying: ``Some like it hot,
some like it cold. Some like it in the pot nine days old. When it
comes, however, to good, stout chili, if you don't like it hot
you're just plum silly.''
   King's group sued the late Frank X. Tolbert, who began the chili
cookoff in 1967 that is held in the Big Bend area, complaining that
the rules of the cookoff were not specific enough.
   In 1983, the two camps began holding their own cookoffs on the
same day, both flying the banner of the Chili Appreciation Society
International.
   Bunton ruled that King had registered the name as a federal
trademark and, therefore, Tolbert had no right to use the name.
   CASI Inc. is to pay Tolbert's heirs $1,500 for the trademark,
but the defendants must pay court costs. No attorneys fees were
awarded.
   Bunton found that prior use of the trademark by Tolbert did not
constitute infringement, but that future use by anyone other than
the King group would.
   Bunton noted that he has no authority over the parties as to
whose cookoff would be the official cookoff of the chili world.
   ``The parties should see this as an issue of good sense and
decency and not look to the courts,'' he said.
   ``The court is confident that members of the groups will take
the view that historically technical distinctions should not be
imposed to prevent the widest possible participation in the event
which has as its purpose social interaction and charitable aims,''
he concluded.

<HEAD>20 People Sentenced For Killing Giant Pandas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court in China's central Sichuan province
convicted 20 people for killing giant pandas and selling the rare
animals' skins, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported Friday.
   The Chinese-language New Evening Post said the culprits were
caught with the help of residents in Pingwu county in the northern
part of the province, but did not elaborate.
   Pingwu is one of the few areas in southwest China where the
giant panda, an endangered species and a national symbol, is found
in the wild.
   The report identified only two defendants, Hu Tianyin and Wang
Jinhua. It said some defendants received life terms and others
received lighter sentences in the April 8 trial.
   The New Evening Post did not give details of how the gang
operated or say how many of the animals were killed.
   China's panda population, just under 1,000, has been declining
for the last five years because a rare flowering cycle of the arrow
bamboo, the animals' main food, has caused many of the plants to
die.

<DATELINE>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 30 minority students
took over the dean's office at Williams College today, the eve of
Parents' Weekend at the prestigious liberal arts school, a
spokesman for the group said.
   The spokesman, who declined to identify himself, said black,
Hispanic, Asian and Polynesian students occupied the Janness House
at 8:30 a.m., when only one member of the dean's staff was in the
building, and the group was not allowing anyone but minority
supporters inside the building.
   Shortly after noon, Dean of the College Stephen Fix issued a
statement saying that college officials were prepared to meet with
the students.
   ``In recent weeks, senior members of the administration have met
with these students _ and have offered repeatedly to hold further
meetings with them _ to discuss their concerns and to report on a
variety of initiatives the college is taking to achieve the
important goals we share,'' Fix said. ``All of us in the college
are prepared to continue such discussions in any atmosphere that is
conducive to the free and open exchange of ideas.''
   However, college spokeswoman Ellen Berek said she did not know
if any meetings had been arranged.
   The group occupying the building calls itself the Coalition
Against Racism Education.
   The students have vowed to stay in the office until the college
responds to their demands for increased minority hiring and other
grievances presented to college President Francis Oakley in
February, the spokesman said.
   ``After receiving inadequate response, we decided this action
was necessary,'' the spokesman said.
   Reading from a prepared statement, he said: ``We took this
action to protest the administration's unwillingness to address
substantially fundamental issues relating to minority concerns at
the college.
   ``These issues relate to recruitment, hiring goals and policies
with regard to minority faculty, staff and students. They also
relate to the broader issues of minority representation in the
curriculum,'' the statement said.
   The protesters also said they were upset that the university
``reneged from its stance of disinvestment advocacy'' in companies
doing business in South Africa.
   Minority students at the University of Massachusetts and
Hampshire College in Amherst, more than 40 miles southeast of
Williamstown, occupied buildings on their campuses for several days
in February to protest racial discrimination at those schools.
   Those protests ended after the heads of the schools signed
agreements with the students to increase funding of minority
projects and make other concessions.

   The Yugoslav airline JAT plans
regular showings of an AIDS prevention film on its planes, a
spokesman said Friday.
   Airline spokesman Miroslav Milekic said JAT has financed the
movie with Medico-Film, a Belgrade company.
   ``Air traffic, regrettably, affects negatively the spread of any
disease, including AIDS,'' Milekic said.
   ``Once it was possible to isolate regions with epidemics. Not
any longer,'' he said. ``Feeling a moral obligation, we co-financed
the film as our contribution to halting the spread of AIDS.''
   Yugoslavia has recorded 16 deaths from acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancers. It is most often transmitted
through sexual contact, transfusions of tainted blood and the
sharing of contaminated needles or syringes by drug abusers.

   A computer operator at a bank in China's
central Sichuan province is being tried on charges of fraud
involving $233,540, an official Chinese news report said.
   The China News Service, in a dispatch appearing Friday in Hong
Kong, said Xie Wendong used a computer at the Agriculture Bank in
Chengdu to transfer the money from the bank to accounts of an
accomplice, Li Qiusheng.
   The report said the city Public Security Bureau and the bank
discovered the fraud and froze the accounts before the money could
be used.
   The news service did not explain how the case came to the
attention of authorities. It said Li also was on trial.

   The first round of the presidential campaign ended
Friday with a burst of speeches, and all indications said President
Francois Mitterrand and Premier Jacques Chirac would make it to the
runoff.
   More than 38.3 million people are registered to vote in Sunday's
election. Mitterrand, 71, a Socialist seeking a second seven-year
term, is expected to finish well in front. The contest is to
determine who will face him in the runoff May 8.
   Chirac, 55, Mitterrand's conservative premier, was in second
place, according to final polls. Under French law, no opinion polls
can be published in the week immediately before an election.
   Former center-right Premier Raymond Barre, 64, who led all
rightist candidates for most of the past year, has stumbled badly
since February but maintains he still has a chance. ``They
shouldn't sell the bearskin until the bear has been killed,'' he
said.
   Friday was the last day of the two-week ``official campaign.''
No further radio and television appearances are permitted and no
political rallies can be held.
   There are nine candidates running in the first round.
   Although the final polls showed Mitterrand would defeat either
Chirac or Barre in the runoff, Chirac had narrowed the gap in the
latest surveys.
   Chirac and Barre both have pledged to throw their support behind
the best-placed conservative in the effort to unseat Mitterand.
   ``The important thing is to defeat socialism and its candidate,
Francois Mitterrand,'' said conservative Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua, speaking at a political meeting. ``The time has come to get
rid of socialism, which has proved its incompetence.''
   If, as is most likely, the runoff is between Mitterrand and
Chirac, the big question is how much of Barre's vote and that of
extreme right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen will switch
to the premier's camp.
   A significant number of Le Pen's supporters are Communists
unhappy with their party's pro-immigrant stand. They could return
to their natural leftist inclinations in the runoff. Barre's
backers include a large number of centrists who may not support
Chirac.
   The biggest unknown is the still large number of undecided
voters. One poll said up to 20 percent were undecided.
   Mitterrand, who scheduled his final big political rally of the
campaign for Friday night at Paris' Le Bourget Airport, has
distanced himself from the Socialist Party he founded and led for a
decade.
   During the final years of his first administration, he has also
abandoned his anti-capitalist rhetoric and moved toward the center.
   Recently he has been increasing harsh on Chirac, calling him
``ultra conservative'' and linking his views with those of Le Pen
and others on the extreme right.
   The language of the campaign has been generally vague, with few
specific proposals from any of the candidates. Le Pen said he was
``stunned by the mediocrity, the inexistence of political debate.''
   In one of his final television appeals, Mitterrand repeated one
of his few specific proposals _ a minimum guaranteed wage which he
said would be partly financed by re-imposition of a tax on large
fortunes.
   The wealth tax was instituted by the Socialists in 1981 and
repealed by the conservatives after they won the 1986 legislative
elections and took control of the National Assembly.
   Chirac stressed defense in one of his last speeches. While
saying disarmament should be a priority, he emphasized that the
first steps had to be made by the superpowers.
   ``If we did not have our nuclear deterrent, we would be the
hostages of Eastern Europe,'' he said of France's small atomic
force.
   In reality, the positions of the three major candidates are
strikingly similar. All stress the importance of 1992 when the
single European market legally goes into effect; all speak of the
need to reform the education system and promote scientific and
technological research to defeat unemployment; all want to reduce
taxes and ensure that the poorest Frenchmen are cared for.
   The differences are mainly a matter of nuance and style.
   The final polls showed Mitterrand leading in the first round
with about 35-37 percent, Chirac with 22-24 percent, Barre at 16-17
percent and Le Pen with 11-12 percent.
   Also running are Andre Lajoinie, the official Communist
candidate; Pierre Juquin, leader of a splinter Communist reform
movement; Arlette Laguiller, a Trotskyist; Antoine Waechter, an
ecologist; and Pierre Boussel, another Trotskyist.

<HEAD>In Catholic West Belfast, Despair Over 86 Percent Unemployment</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 23-year-old Ciaran Hall, a
Roman Catholic whose entire life has been caught up in the violence
of Belfast, finding a job has become an impossible dream.
   ``All my life I've been unemployed,'' he said. ``I've tried
everything now to get a job. I even tried to be a street cleaner.
But there doesn't seem much likelihood; there's too much
prejudice.''
   Northern Ireland's overall jobless rate is 17 percent _ nearly
double mainland Britain's. Catholics, although 40 percent of the
province's 1.5 million population, suffer 2{ times more
unemployment than Protestants.
   In mainly Catholic west Belfast, unemployment is about 47
percent with pockets as high as 86 percent for young men.
   The British government is under pressure from local community
and religious leaders, the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and
Labor Party and the Irish government to tackle unemployment and
urban decay in west Belfast.
   They argue that the area is a recruiting ground for the outlawed
Irish Republican Army because many of its 100,000 residents have no
jobs, live in poor housing and are in constant friction with the
security forces.
   ``People only turn to paramilitary organizations in desperation,
only when they are a last option,'' said Dan Keenan, a spokesman
for the Catholic Social Democrati Labor Party. ``If you do give
them a chance _ treat them with decency, humanity, and give them
jobs _ I think you will find support for the IRA withering away.''
   The government has unveiled draft legislation to stamp out bias
by making companies monitor the religious makeup of their work
forces. It also threatens criminal charges against those who make
insufficient effort to recruit minority workers.
   But the laws will not go into effect before next year, and
critics say they are not tough enough.
   The IRA, fighting to end British rule and unite the province
with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic, regards factories,
shops and offices as legitimate targets, attacking dozens even in
their west Belfast stronghold. The fire-blackened shells of the
Lake Glen Hotel and a number of stores in the heart of the district
stand as reminders of past IRA gasoline-bomb attacks.
   The Rev. Matthew Wallace told mourners at the funeral of a
Catholic man killed by a Protestant extremist that the nation's
leaders must stop talking and do something to alleviate the ``great
deprivation'' in west Belfast.
   ``For many young people, unemployment is their lives and that is
an indictment of those who look after us, those who govern our
country,'' Wallace said. ``Unless something is done, we will be
celebrating a lot more funerals.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, Britain's chief minister in
the province, said this month that the government is working on
proposals for the economic regeneration of west Belfast but details
have not been disclosed.
   One proposal before the government would finance the creation of
up to 20 companies, employing 30 to 50 people each, which would be
owned initially by the West Belfast Enterprise Board.
   ``We hope that if we can prove that business can operate safely
in the area that we will be able to entice outside investment into
west Belfast,'' said John Carlin, a board member who teaches at the
College of Business Studies.
   West Belfast's major employer is the Royal Victoria Hospital.
The area never had an industrial infrastructure and its old textile
and spinning factories stand idle. The only two major
government-subsidized businesses in west Belfast _ the U.S.
DeLorean auto company and Strathern Audio Ventures _ both failed.
   The government has financed various youth training programs, but
surveys show that over 80 percent of the trainees fail to get jobs
when the courses end.
   Ciaran Hall said he was forced to quit a bricklaying course
after being hit between his eyes by a police plastic bullet in 1981.
   Five years later he completed a three-month toolmaking course
run by a private company in a Protestant area in 1986 but wasn't
kept on.
   ``I was a Catholic so I didn't have much chance,'' he said in an
interview outside the welfare office in west Belfast.
   ``These last two years, I've done nothing, just walked the
streets and sat in the house _ that's it. It's depressing. ... I
would do anything at all. You name it, I'd do it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prisoners Freed On 100th Day Of New Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Nationalist government Friday freed
about 6,000 prisoners and reduced jail terms for about 16,000
others to commemorate the 100th day after President Chiang
Ching-kuo's death.
   Under the mass commutation, 19 political prisoners were released
from jail and sentences were cut for 11 others, according to
Justice Ministry officials.
   Ministry officials said the release of the 6,054 prisoners,
including gangsters, drug addicts and corrupt officials, began at
dawn after brief ceremonies at jails around the island.
   Each prisoner was given a red package containing about $17 to
wish them luck, they said.
   Television showed the prisoners, some smiling and some tearful,
met by anxious wives, children and other relatives waiting in
drizzly weather outside the jails.
   President Lee Teng-hui proposed the commutations in February
after succeeding Chiang, who died of heart failure on January 13.
Lee, the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist government,
spent part of the day at rural Tahsi southwest of Taipei paying his
respects at the late leader's masoleum.
   Many analysts believed Lee would be an ineffectual figurehead
after the end of the authoritarian Chiang Kai-shek family dynasty.
But Lee, a low-key vice president under Chiang Ching-kuo, has
emerged as a popular leader of growing influence who has maintained
a high profile since becoming president.
   Lee was named acting Nationalist Party chief to replace Chiang
just two week's after the former president's death and is widely
expected to be named party chairman at a congress in July.
   ``He's not as powerful as President Chiang and he may never be,
but he's not a figurehead ... He's done better than some people
expected,'' Lu Ya-li, a political science professor at National
Taiwan University, said in a recent interview. ``He's aware there
isn't any serious rival to him.''
   Lee has spent much of his time pushing his predecessor's policy
of introducing democratic change. Chiang's re-evaluation of
Taiwan's relationship with Communist China also is continuing.
   Chiang Ching-kuo's father, Chiang Kai-shek, brought the
Nationalists to Taiwan after the Chinese Communists chased them
from mainland China in 1949. His party still claims to be the
rightful ruler of all China.
   The Nationalist government still prohibits official contact with
China but increasingly tolerates unofficial links, such as indirect
trade and travel to the mainland to visit relatives.
   Among the released political prisoners Friday were six Taiwanese
businessmen sentenced in 1984 and 1986 to 10 to 12 years in jail
for visiting mainland China for business purposes, Justice Ministry
officials said.
   Another released political prisoner was 47-year-old Pai Ya-chan,
who was sentenced in 1975 to life imprisonment for distributing
leaflets calling on Chiang Ching-kuo, then chairman of the
governing Nationalist Party, to reveal his wealth and to recall his
daughter from the United States to show his confidence in Taiwan.
   After arriving at Taipei's domestic airport from a jail on Green
Island, 180 miles southeast of Taipei, Pai tearfully told reporters
he was grateful for those people who ``fought hard for human rights
and ending political oppression.'' He said he wanted to join
opposition politics.
   Under Friday's commutation, death sentences were reduced to life
imprisonment, life sentences to 15 years and lesser sentences were
cut by one-third or one-half. Many prisoners released already were
serving sentences reduced when martial law was lifted in July.
   Justice Ministry official Huang Shih-min said the commutations
affected all but a few hundred prisoners sentenced for first-degree
murders, ammunition smuggling and other crimes that could
``endanger national security and social stability.''
   Two political prisoners did not have their sentences reduced
because they were accused of being communists, officials said. Two
men jailed earlier this year for advocating an independent Taiwan
were not affected by the commutation because the verdicts are under
appeal.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has called for the
immediate release of all political prisoners.
   Noted dissident Shih Ming-teh had his life sentence commuted to
15 years ending in 1995, officials said. Shih, 47, was jailed for
involvement in a bloody 1979 anti-government demonstration in the
southern port of Kaohsiung. He has been kept in a military hospital
in Taipei because of his frail health.
   After Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, the government released
3,500 prisoners and reduced the sentences of 13,000 others in a
similar mass commutation.

   Riot police fired tear gas Friday to
drive back thousands of radical students hurling rocks and
firebombs and calling for the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Protesters in Seoul and the southern cities of Pusan and Kwangju
said the government must be defeated in Tuesday's National Assembly
elections. They shouted ``Down with the dictatorship!'' and
``Overthrow the ruling party!''
   The government has deployed thousands of riot police across the
nation to quell growing violence in campaigning for the elections.
Roh ordered a crackdown Thursday after dozens of people were
injured in confrontations between supporters of rival candidates.
   The worst violence Friday was at Jooang University in Seoul.
Hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and visored
helmets marched on the campus to stop a march by students from nine
colleges.
   Protesters hurled hundreds of rocks and firebombs that exploded
in sheets of burning gasoline. Police armored vans and rifle squads
fired barrages of tear gas.
   Students with firebombs and rocks battled police briefly in a
street clash in the southern opposition stronghold of Kwangju.
Police fired tear gas to break up the protest.
   Clashes were reported at two other Seoul colleges and at Dongui
University in the port of Pusan. Students staged peaceful
anti-government protests in Taegu and Kunsan.
   Several injuries were reported in the clashes, but no overall
figures were available.
   In Seoul, riot police broke up a protest by about 120
journalists urging the government to issue a permit for a new
newspaper.
   Two hundred police moved in when journalists from the projected
Hankyoreh newspaper occupied stairs of the Sejong Cultural Center
in downtown Seoul to stage a sit-in. There were no injuries
reported.
   Earlier Friday, radicals firebombed an office of the governing
Democratic Justice Party in Seoul, police said. Nobody was reported
injured.
   The party's office in the northern city of Chechon was damaged
overnight in a bomb attack, police said.
   An office of the opposition Reunification Democratic Party was
set on fire in an attack in the southern city of Taegu, police
said. Large amounts of campaign literature were destroyed, but
there were no injuries.
   Opposition leaders repeated charges that the government would
rig the elections. They threatened to call for massive protests if
the elections are not fair.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam told a news conference that Roh
was concealing widespread official corruption. He issued a list of
53 governing party assembly candidates he alleged were
``anti-national'' and guilty of corruption.
   The opposition has been attempting to discredit Roh with recent
revelations of alleged fraud in the administration of his
predecessor, former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   The rival opposition parties, hobbled by divisions and public
anger over their internal power struggles, hope to deny the
government a majority in the National Assembly. Roh was elected in
December when the opposition split.

   Ilona ``Cicciolina'' Staller, the sex star who won
a seat in Italy's Parliament, arrived in Japan on Friday to
campaign against AIDS but was shunned by Japanese politicians.
   Clutching a pink teddy bear and blowing kisses, Staller was
greeted by more than 60 photographers, reporters and well-wishers
at Tokyo's Narita International Airport. Even Japan's usually staid
police lined the rails to watch her news conference.
   Japan permits her movies to be shown here, but they are heavily
censored.
   Sitting in front of posters featuring a topless Cicciolina, she
faced tough questioning from the media about her recent test for
AIDS, which she said she passed.
   The Japanese Diet, or parliament, is currently discussing a bill
that would bar AIDS-infected foreigners. As of August, the Ministry
of Health and Welfare reported 43 AIDS patients in Japan, and 225
virus carriers.
   There were reported plans for Staller to be met at the airport
by a member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. But those
plans were apparently scrapped at the last moment.

   Blues-rock band ZZ Top donated one of a
pair of specially commissioned guitars made of wood from the home
of late Muddy Waters, to kick off a $1 million fund-raising
campaign for the Delta Blues Museum.
   More than 1,500 people attended the ceremony Thursday night on
the steps of the Carnegie Public Library, where the museum is
housed.
   The two guitars were made from cypress wood taken from the house
where Waters grew up on Stovall Plantation, north of Clarksdale.
   One guitar will be put on display in the museum, while ZZ Top
member Billy Gibbons will take the other on tour. The guitars are
white with a replica of the Mississippi River running down the neck
and base.
   ``He (Waters) would have been honored by the presence of the
press and public,'' ZZ Top member Frank Beard said. ``But he
probably would have just picked up a guitar, gone over in a corner
and played.''
   The ceremony was followed by the library's annual catfish fry.
   Waters, born McKinly Morganfield, won fame as a Chicago bluesman
from the 1950s through the 1970s with classics such as ``Hoochie
Coochie Man,'' ``Rolling Stone,'' and ``Got My Mojo Working.''
Waters died in 1983 at 68.

   The University of Pittsburgh has named its
center for international security studies after Matthew B. Ridgway,
one of the last surviving full generals of World War II.
   At a tribute Thursday night in the school's Cathedral of
Learning, the center officially was named The Matthew B. Ridgway
Center for International Security Studies.
   ``Only through the pursuit of ideals was our nation and our
government brought into being. ... Those ideas should be still our
guide and that, in the long run, will determine whether we stand
our fall,'' said Ridgway, 94, a Pittsburgh resident for 33 years.
He attended the tribute with his wife, Penny.
   Ridgway, an innovator of airborne tactics, planned and led the
attack on Sicily in 1943. It was the first large-scale airborne
assault in Army history.
   The Ridgway center, founded in 1975, will focus on research,
teaching and programs covering security issues such as ``Star
Wars'' and strategic arms control.

   Cardinal John J. O'Connor said there has been a
serious proposal that he celebrate a Christmas Mass in Moscow that
would be televised throughout the Soviet Union.
   The New York prelate mentioned the proposal Thursday at a news
conference called to discuss his meeting with Cuban President Fidel
Castro. But he declined to reveal any details about the proposal,
including who made it.
   O'Connor was talking about his hope that the church might be
given access to government-controlled airwaves in Cuba. Then he
added:
   ``I might just use as a parallel that there has been a serious
proposal to me that on Christmas Day I offer Mass in Moscow with
the promise that the Mass would be televised throughout the Soviet
Union.''
   ``It would seem to me that if that could happen, the potential
for the church to communicate very freely here would be turned into
a real possibility,'' he said.
   Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the New York archdiocese, said
Friday he did not know about the proposal.
   O'Connor also said Castro indicated that hundreds of political
prisoners could be freed from Cuban jails if the United States gave
them visas.
   The cardinal, who held three hours of talks with the Cuban
leader before dawn Thursday, said Castro welcomed the possibility
of having a representative of the American Catholic Church act as a
liaison between the prisoners and U.S. authorities in order to
speed up the visa process.
   O'Connor said Castro told him there were 453 political prisoners
in Cuba.
   ``I think he indicated ... that a very, very large proportion of
those could be released from prison quite quickly if visas were
granted by the United States, and that it is important that if they
are released, they leave the country immediately,'' O'Connor said.
   The Roman Catholic cardinal said the president also agreed to a
request for more visas for foreign nuns, but did not give a
specific figure.
   O'Connor said the two also discussed the possibility of
U.S.-Cuban cooperation in health care, particularly the fight
against AIDS.
   The cardinal said he stressed to Castro that the church
transcends politics.
   ``I told the president frankly that I think he had a tremendous
opportunity to use the church in the right sense of the term. I
told him it certainly should not be exploited,'' O'Connor said.
   In response, O'Connor said, Castro praised the American church
for its work and spoke glowingly of the pope.
   O'Connor was asked whether Castro might allow the church access
to the government-controlled airwaves.
   ``I would hope that that would be one of the things that would
happen in the not too distant future,'' he said.
   Earlier, O'Connor told reporters, ``I feel that the mission was
accomplished and that the president recognized clearly my primary
purpose in coming here.''
   He described that goal as showing the solidarity of the church
throughout the world and its dedication to peace.
   A meeting with Castro had been expected. Reporters were hustled
from the Wednesday night Mass celebrated by the cardinal and taken
to the presidential palace, where they were told Castro had agreed
to a photo session with the visiting prelate.
   At 11:30 p.m., a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Castro had
canceled the photo session because O'Connor arrived late.

   Israeli warplanes blasted Palestinian
guerrilla bases in hills overlooking the Mediterranean south of
Beirut today in their sixth attack on Lebanon this year, police
reported.
   They said eight fighter-bombers took part in the 10-minute air
attack, bombing and rocketing a string of guerrilla positions
belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   The group is based in Damascus, Syria, and also is backed by
Libya. It is headed by Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian army captain.
   The group had claimed responsibility for an attack on a north
Israeli Army base by a guerrilla flying a motorized hand glider in
November. Six Israeli soldiers were killed and eight others wounded
in that attack.
   Confirming today's air raid, the army command in Israel said its
planes bombed and destroyed Arab guerrilla command posts and
ammunition depots north of Lebanon's port of Sidon, provincial
capital of south Lebanon.
   It said in a brief communique that the raiding jets returned
safely to base after scoring accurate hits on their targets.
   The police said the stricken targets stretch along a three-mile
strip from the coastal town of Damour to the outskirts of Barja in
the Kharroub region, about 15 miles south of the Lebanese capital,
police said.
   They said guerrillas fired anti-aircraft guns and Soviet-made
SAM-7 Strella missiles on the raiding jets. The Israeli planes
released hot air balloons to defelect the heat-seeking projectiles.
   Police said Beirut Airport was closed to traffic during the
attack. They said they had no immediate report of casualties.
   At least 48 people have been killed and 63 wounded in the five
previous Israeli raids since Jan. 3.
   The last attack targeted guerrilla bases in hills southeast of
Sidon on March 24. Nine people were killed and five wounded in that
attack.

<HEAD>IRS Revokes PTL's Tax Exempt Status
^Eds: Combines urgent series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service announced today it
has revoked the tax-exempt status of the troubled PTL ministry.
   The announcement follows a court ruling earlier this week
dissolving a preliminary injunction that had prevented the IRS from
taking such action.
   Les Witmer, a spokesman for the IRS regional office in Atlanta,
said the action was taken because ``we felt the organization has
not operated within the guidelines ... in its original charter.''
   He said court papers filed in conjunction with PTL's bankruptcy
proceedings indicated that individuals in the organization had
profited substantially from donations made to the ministry and that
PTL had ``excessive unrelated business income or income which was
not really in keeping with the tax-exempt purpose.''
   Linda Ivey, a PTL spokeswoman, said ministry officials were not
immediately available for comment.
   An IRS statement said the agency ``can no longer assure
taxpayers of the deductibility of contributions to PTL,'' effective
immediately.
   Past contributions are fully deductible, however, it said. And
if PTL appeals the action to federal court, contributions by
individuals would still be deductible up to $1,000 until the appeal
is decided, the IRS said.
   ``In any event, however, contributions to PTL are not deductible
by any individual who was, in whole or part, responsible for the
activities on the part of the organization that were the basis for
the revocation,'' the statement said. ``Generally, this would not
include the PTL partners and contributors.''
   The IRS said it would re-evaluate the situation if PTL is
re-established or forms a new, exclusively charitable organization.
   PTL's troubles began in March 1987 when its founder, Jim Bakker,
resigned amid allegations of sexual improprieties. The ministry,
based in Fort Mill, S.C., filed for reorganization in federal
bankruptcy court in June 1987.
   On Wednesday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Va., affirmed a federal judge's ruling that the bankruptcy court
did not have the authority to issue a preliminary injunction
preventing the IRS from revoking the ministry's tax-exempt status.
   PTL trustee David Clark said then that the ministry was
considering additional appeals.

   President Reagan said today that Attorney
General Edwin Meese should not resign and has not offered to,
despite a face-to-face meeting in which two departing Justice
Department officials told the president that Meese's behavior is
hurting his department.
   The president, walking to the White House after a nearby meeting
on an unrelated subject, was asked about the troubles of his
attorney general.
   ``Should Meese resign?'' a reporter asked.
   ``No,'' said the president.
   ``Has he offered to?''
   ``No.''
   The president was then asked if the Justice Department was
running well.
   ``Just fine,'' he replied.
   Earlier, Reagan's chief of staff, Howard Baker, told an
interviewer:
   ``We don't know what will happen next. All we know is that the
attorney general is functioning and functioning well and that the
president expressed his continuing confidence.''
   Baker was referring to Reagan's meeting with Meese Wednesday,
which sources said came minutes after one of the two aides told the
president that an aggressive prosecutor would seek Meese's
indictment.
   One of those aides, Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns Burns
said today he and former criminal division chief William Weld had
``a marvelous conversation'' with Reagan. Burns said the president
``was very candid.''
   ``It was a very, very frank exchange of ideas that we had with
him and he's got to make his decision in his way in his own time
and I'm confident that he will do it,'' said Burns.
   Burns, meeting with reporters on his last day on the job, said,
``I have to confess to you that it is indeed a very sad day.''
   During the 45-minute discussion called by the president, Burns
told Reagan, Vice President George Bush, Baker and White House
counsel A.B. Culvahouse that ``Meese's behavior was hurting the
Department of Justice,'' an administration source said.
   Weld, meanwhile, ``laid out the facts'' in a hypothetical
indictment he said he would have brought against Meese if he were
the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general, said the
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Burns told Reagan that Meese had violated the standards of
ethical conduct for executive branch employees spelled out in a
1965 executive order and that if other Justice Department attorneys
had acted as Meese has, ``they would be bounced (fired),'' the
source added.
   The ethical standards, among other things, say that employees
should avoid any action which could create the appearance of using
public office for private gain, giving preferential treatment to
any organization or person or making a government decision outside
official channels.
   ``The president was very attentive, listened to the story, got
up and Meese came in'' after Burns and Weld left, said the source.
   The Washington Post today quoted a source, who also requested
anonymity, as saying Reagan commented that he would not make any
decision about Meese's future until independent counsel James C.
McKay finishes his report on the attorney general.
   Since last May 11, Meese has been the subject of a criminal
investigation by McKay, who has been examining Meese's assistance
to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a proposed $1 billion Iraqi
oil pipeline project at the behest of longtime friend E. Robert
Wallach. Also under investigation are Meese's meetings with
regional Bell telephone company executives at a time when he owned
$14,000 in Baby Bell stock and Wallach's role in securing a
$40,000-a-year job for Meese's wife.
   In an interview published in today's USA Today and conducted
before word of his meeting with Reagan became public, Meese said
the president continues to express his ``total support ... and
total confidence.''
   The attorney general told the newspaper he meets the highest
ethical standards expected of public officials and knows of no
factor ``right now that would cause me to resign.''
   At the Justice Department today, spokesman Patrick Korten said
he would have no immediate comment.
   A department source close to Meese, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the meeting between Reagan and Meese lasted
longer than the one involving Burns and Weld and that the president
had expressed full support for the attorney general.
   In the meeting with Reagan, Burns told the president that
Wallach, who is under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, had taken
advantage of his relationship with the attorney general to promote
his own business interests, said the administration source.
   Burns, while not using these specific words, in effect told
Reagan that ``Wallach was selling the office of the attorney
general,'' the source added.
   During the White House meeting, Weld told Reagan that if he were
the special prosecutor in the criminal investigation of Meese, he
would seek an indictment of the attorney general, said the source.
   Weld had made similar comments to Meese on March 29 when Weld
and Burns announced to the attorney general that they were quitting
out of concern that the nearly yearlong probe of Meese has damaged
the Justice Department's operations, morale and image.
   According to the source, Weld in his meeting with Reagan ``laid
out the facts'' in a hypothetical indictment.
   In the past, said several administration sources, Weld has told
Justice Department associates that he feels a number of felony
charges could be lodged against Meese based on the evidence known
to date. These would include conspiracy counts and involve the
acceptance of illegal gratuities, a violation of Ethics in
Government Act provisions spelling out conflicts of interest and a
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act barring bribes to
foreign officials, the sources said.
   According to the sources, Weld's legal analysis in part revolves
around:
   _A September 1985 memo to Meese from Wallach in connection with
the Iraqi pipeline mentions planned payments to the Israeli Labor
Party of then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Meese says he doesn't
recall reading the portion of the memo regarding planned payments.
   _A $150,000 legal fee paid by one of the partners in the oil
pipeline to Wallach which ended up in a stock trading account owned
by W. Franklyn Chinn, Meese's financial manager. Chinn in effect
pooled Wallach's money with that of Meese and a few other
investors, enabling him to buy large amounts of brand-new stock
issues and sell them on the same day, usually at a substantial
profit.
   Three months before the fee went to Wallach, Meese had referred
his longtime friend to then-National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, who directed subordinates to try to facilitate an
insurance package to enable the pipeline to be built. Chinn turned
a $40,000 profit for Meese on a $50,000 investment in just 23 stock
trades over 18 months. Meese says that under the partnership with
Chinn, all financial details were kept secret from him.

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Lose Another Attempt on Campaign Spending Limits
Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats put their congressional
campaign spending limits proposal on the shelf Friday after losing
another attempt to overcome Republican opposition and force a vote
on the issue.
   Fifty-three senators, including four Republicans, voted to
invoke cloture, or end debate, but this was seven votes short of
what is needed to suspend the Senate's unlimited debate rule.
   This was the tenth time since last June that Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., lost a cloture on the divisive issue.
   The first eight attempts came over a bill that would have
established a voluntary system of limits for Senate campaigns.
   The latest losses on Thursday and Friday prevented a vote on a
proposal by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., to amend the Constitution
to overcome a Supreme Court ruling that mandatory limits violate
free speech rights.
   Byrd said after Friday's attempt that six of the 10 absent
senators would have voted for cloture, leaving him ``within
striking distance'' of the needed 60 votes.
   He said that while he was pulling the issue from the floor,
members shouldn't assume that he would not bring it back in the
future.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Republicans don't
oppose placing limits on campaign spending but as a group don't
want to tamper with the Constitution or vote for any legislation
that would favor Democrats.
   ``I'm willing to try to work out some bipartisan measure that is
fair across-the-board and doesn't discriminate against anybody,''
Dole said. ``We are spending too much money.''
   He and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that even if Byrd
succeeded in winning cloture for the proposed constitutional
amendment, it was unlikely the measure could get the 67 votes
needed to pass the Senate.

<HEAD>Science Class Calls Junk-Food Experiment A Success _ Despite
Mishap</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixth graders who fed an
experimental rat a steady diet of junk food and watched him
deteriorate into red-eyed lethargy say they're convinced: The road
to good living isn't paved with tasty treats.
   But there was one problem with the experiment. The junk food
rat, Honey, outlived his companion, Nut, who was fed only health
food. Nut died while choking on a cracker as the results were
announced Thursday.
   ``He was extremely healthy,'' a distraught Kathie Dilks assured
her class at Harrison Township Elementary School. The teacher
announced that they would provide Nut with a proper burial.
   The experiment had been slated to last another 3{ weeks, but,
even with Nut's death, the results have already convinced students
like Paul Amiss, 12, to heed the good nutritional points his mom
has been making for years.
   ``She likes me to eat healthy stuff so I can grow healthy. If
you eat too much junk food, you won't grow up,'' Paul said, adding
that all the hoopla probably won't stop him from enjoying a candy
bar once in awhile.
   ``I usually eat them for dessert,'' he whispered out of the
earshot of the adults who were busy explaining the results of the
first 10 days of the five-week experiment.
   The test showed that a steady diet of junk food caused a baby
white rat to grow at a slower rate than a companion rat who was fed
the school-lunch menu, Ms. Dilks said.
   Honey, who dined on Oreo cookies, red licorice and orange
marshmallows, appeared lethargic and sleepy during a news
conference at the southern New Jersey school. An open can of stale
soda waited nearby in case Honey grew thirsty.
   ``Rats cannot burp. When you feed them soda, you have to make
sure it's flat,'' said Julie McGrath, a registered dietitian with
the Philadelphia-based Blue Ribbon Services Inc., the food-service
company that sponsored the experiment.
   Honey frisked and twitched around his glass cage when not dozing.
   ``It's probably a sugar high,'' Ms. Dilks said.
   Honey, who weighed in at 45.5 grams, also looked a tad dingy.
   ``He's a little yellow. He's not getting enough nutrients,' said
12-year-old Mark Plum as he escorted the red-eyed rodent around the
classroom.
   Nut, the rat who munched on tossed salads, bananas and pizza,
weighed in at a whopping 78 grams prior to his sudden death and
showed substantial tail growth.
   ``We want to apply this to our own eating habits,'' Ms. McGrath
told 16 nodding heads who offered examples of how the test changed
their lives.
   Orange juice and cheese appears to be the new after-school snack
for the majority of the class, except 11-year-old Nelson Irizarry.
   ``Nah, my mom doesn't let me eat junk food anyway,'' he said.
   Ms. McGrath said she would obtain two more rats to complete the
experiment before school ends in June.

<HEAD>Three Policemen Die In Separatist Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melanesian separatists stormed a
police station Friday and fled with 26 police hostages after a
battle that left three French officers dead and about 20 people
wounded.
   More than 20 kidnappers attacked with guns and knives on the
small island of Ouvea, about 90 miles northeast of Noumea, capital
of this French Pacific territory. They demanded that 300 police
reinforcements be withdrawn and that Paris send an emissary to
discuss independence.
   Officials said Friday night that negotiations had not begun and
that police had not been in contact with the attackers, who fled
into the bush with their captives. A massive search was under way.
   The attack came two days before a territorial election on a new
autonomy plan for the archipelago, coinciding with the French
presidential elections.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the
territory's 145,000 people. The rest are European settlers,
Polynesians and Asians.
   Many Melanesians seek independence, and most European settlers
want to remain French. Trouble first broke out in November 1984 and
has erupted sporadically since then, leaving 31 people dead.
   In other incidents Thursday and Friday, the city hall of Paita
was set on fire and power lines were blown up near Canala. Two
grenades were thrown at a separatist radio station in Noumea and a
shot was fired at a police vehicle. No injuries were reported in
the incidents.
   The attack on Ouvea, a 100-square-mile atoll with a population
of about 2,800, was carried out about 7 a.m. by 20 to 30 men in the
village of Fayaoue.
   Families of the policemen who lived at the station were not
attacked and suffered no injuries, officials said. The station
itself was sacked and a large amount of unspecified equipment
stolen.
   Among the wounded were three policeman, one in critical
condition with a bullet wound in the back of the head, and three of
the attackers, one listed in serious condition, police said. The
seriously injured were evacuated to Noumea.
   In Paris, the government of Premier Jacques Chirac vowed to
re-establish order as quickly as possible.
   ``Instructions have been given to dispatch the necessary
reinforcements to the island of Ouvea,'' said Bernard Pons,
minister for overseas territories, after an urgent meeting between
Chirac and ministers directly concerned.
   ``The government cannot accept attacks on policemen, that they
kill them and take them hostage,'' Pons said. ``It will not allow
things to get worse.''
   Leopold Joredie, security minister of the self-proclaimed
``government of Kanaky,'' said in a telephone interview that he had
been in contact with a leader of the attackers.
   ``The gendarmes held by the people in Ouvea are in good
health,'' Joredie said. ``There are no wounded among them. They are
all well treated.''
   He said the attackers refused to negotiate while police
reinforcements remained on the island.
   Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front, the main separatist organization, told The
Associated Press by telephone he did not know of the attack in
advance.
   Tjibaou called the incident ``frightful,'' but said it was not
surprising in that ``demands for independence are absolutely not
taken into consideration, that people are scorned and the
government refuses to listen to them.''
   Tjibaou's organization, which is boycotting the elections, also
boycotted last year's referendum on independence, saying only
Melanesians should be allowed to vote. The territory voted
overwhelmingly for France.

<NOTE>Eds: Top 9 grafs new with Reagan speech; picks up 3rd graf pvs,
Byrd's comments.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan charged today that the
Democratic leadership of Congress ``has caved in to organized
labor'' on key issues of the trade bill that he has threatened to
veto.
   Reagan told the Legislative Exchange Council, a group of
conservative legislators, that the plant-closing provision in the
bill would cost American jobs by hurting industry.
   The provision would require industries to give 60 days notice to
employees of plant closings.
   ``I'd like to be able to sign trade legislation this year,'' the
president said. ``I've worked in good faith with Congress to
produce an acceptable bill.''
   ``Put simply, on key provisions in the tradd bill, the
Democratic leadership in Congress has caved in to pressure from
organized labor,'' he said. ``The plant-closing restriction in the
bill would make American industry less competitive. Not the way to
go if you want to redress the trade imabalance and save jobs. In
fact, the restriction would cost jobs.''
   Reagan quoted an unnamed Washington lobbyist as saying of his
veto threat, ``I think he's crying wolf.''
   ``Try me,'' the president told the group. ``If this bill is
unloaded on my desk, I'll stamp it `reject' and ship it back to
where it was made.''
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said he was not sure the bill
would pass the Senate by the two-thirds majority needed to override
a threatened presidential veto.
   But Byrd said Reagan, when deciding whether to veto it, should
not presume the Senate could quickly strip out provisions opposed
by the White House and pass another version.
   Byrd's comments came as the Senate began debate on the bill, the
result of a House-Senate compromise between competing versions. The
measure rolled through the House on Thursday by an overwhelming
312-107 vote.
   ``The administration ought to pay close attention to the
whopping majority of that vote,'' Byrd said. ``I think the House
vote will give added momentum'' to its supporters in the Senate.
   Byrd said he could ``only hope'' that if Reagan vetoed the bill,
the Senate could find the two-thirds majority needed to override.
The president's lobbyists were working hard against it, he said.
   If the president's veto were sustained and the Senate forced to
bring forward a new bill, it would have to re-run the ``obstacle
course'' the current compromise has already cleared, he said. The
president should assume ``this is it _ it won't get another
chance,'' said Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
defended the measure as providing the trade policy the nation needs.
   ``We haven't had a trade policy ... since World War II,'' and
did without one while the United States was the world's dominant
economic power, he said. ``But that time has changed, and now we're
in tough competition.''
   Before debate began, opponents of the bill asked for assurances
of adequate debate time. Byrd said the vote would not occur before
Tuesday evening.
   Byrd again warned that an administration favorite _ the pending
free-trade agreement to phase out tariffs between the United States
and Canada _ could get entangled in any Reagan veto.
   Reagan said Thursday that he will veto the bill if it arrives on
his desk with a provision to require all but the smallest employers
to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   Business groups have fought the plant-closings provision on
grounds it would dry up capital for investment, frighten off
customers and cause economic stagnation. Unions are calling for the
measure, saying that notifying employees about to lose their jobs
is the only humane thing to do.
   In recent days the dispute over plant closings has overshadowed
the centerpiece features of the bill, which would streamline the
system under which the United States aids companies threatened by
imports and retaliates against international trade violations.
   Scores of other provisions range from repeal of the windfall oil
profits tax to sizeable agricultural subsidies.
   A key vote in the House came just before the roll call on final
passage, when lawmakers voted 253-167 against a move by Minority
Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., to send the measure back to
conference committee with orders to drop the plant-closings
provision.
   On the final vote on the bill itself, the hefty House margin
reflected concern in Northeastern states over import competition
and perhaps election-year reluctance to fight anything billed as
sharpening the U.S. edge in global markets.
   On the roll call, 244 Democrats backed the bill and two opposed
it. Reps. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., said it should go further and
include something similar to his amendment to roll back Japanese
trade surpluses. Rep. Robert J. Mrazek, D-N.Y., said the bill
contained too much protectionism.
   Sixty-eight Republicans voted for the bill and 105 opposed it.
There were heavy defections among New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania Republicans.
   The lawmakers spent most of the afternoon leading up to the vote
arguing over the plant-closings provision.
   ``This amendment is obviously a non-germane, counterproductive
hitchhiker that's going to get this bill vetoed,'' Rep. William
Frenzel, R-Minn., said. ``We can exorcize this demon.''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., called the bill too important
to get hung up on an issue such as plant-closing notifications. He
said it ought to be viewed as a relatively minor amendment because
``it is so modest, it has been so watered down and it contains so
many exceptions'' that it probably would not do as much as its
supporters hoped.
   ``I want to talk about plant openings not plant closings,'' said
Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called on lawmakers to
imagine how their families would be affected if they suddenly lost
their jobs. He called for approval of the bill with the
plant-closings provision intact.

   Actress Marlee Matlin, in a letter to The New
York Times, has complained about its coverage of her appearance at
the Academy Awards.
   During her appearance on the Oscar program, Miss Matlin, who is
deaf, spoke without using sign language. The Times' article on
April 13 said some people viewed that as ``a blow not only to deaf
people but also to the goal of `total communication.'''
   ``I do not sign and speak simultaneously, and when I chose to
sign alone (with an off-camera voice) or to speak alone, as I did
on the Oscar ceremony telecast, I could have potentially ignored
two major segments of the deaf community _ those who use speech and
do not sign and those who sign and do not use speech,'' she wrote.
   ``Fortunately, the telecast was closed captioned ... and
everyone, regardless of communication preference, had access. So
what's the big fuss?'' read the letter, which appeared Friday.
   The star of ``Children of a Lesser God'' closed her letter with
a complimentary P.S.: ``But thank you for the nice picture.''

<TEXT>
   An infant taken from a hospital four
hours after his birth has been found, and a Texas couple have been
arrested in the case.
   A policeman involved in the recovery happened to be the infant's
godfather and namesake.
   Albert Cecil Dwayne Lewis, 25, and Judy K. Lewis, 32, both of
Crowell, Texas, were arrested in Holbrook after the infant was
found early Thursday in the back seat of a car, said police Capt.
Bob Reed.
   The infant was taken Wednesday from Yavapai Regional Medical
Center in Prescott, apparently by a woman masquerading as a
hospital laboratory worker. Police said the woman told the mother
she was taking the baby for tests.
   Mrs. Lewis said in a court appearance in Holbrook that she was
forced into participating in the abduction because her husband
wanted a baby.
   The Lewises were returned to Prescott, where they were being
held in Yavapai County Jail in lieu of $137,000 bail each on
charges of kidnapping, burglary, felony endangerment and custodial
interference.
   Yavapai County sheriff's Capt. Robert Carson said today that he
was notified this morning that the initial three charges had been
amended late Thursday to include the kidnapping count. He said
earlier today that prosecutors were studying whether the couple
could be charged with kidnapping.
   Douglas Gerwitz, newborn son of Lisa and John Gerwitz of the
Payson area, was discovered after Mrs. Lewis asked Holbrook police
for traveler's aid, such as gas money and a place to stay, Sgt.
Stewart Bracke said.
   She said she was alone but Officer Douglas Newton, the child's
godfather and namesake, discovered she was traveling with a man and
a baby, Bracke said.
   `It's a heck of a coincidence,'' Newton said.
   Police found the couple and the baby matched descriptions from
the Prescott case and were able to confirm the baby's identity in
three hours.
   Bracke said the boy was taken to Holbrook Community Hospital
where he was pronounced in good health.
   Yavapai hospital administrator Michael Vitek said the woman who
took Douglas apparently masqueraded as a technician by dressing in
a lab coat.
   ``Lab coats are in the nurses' lounge, and on hall trees in the
OB department. Hospital policy is that when our OB nurses go to a
different part of the hospital, they put on the lab coats to
minimize infections,'' Vitek said.
   He said hospital officials will review the ``entire package of
hospital policies relating to security of infants.''

<HEAD>Chambers County Rancher Says Lion Hunts Legal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chance to hunt a lion is the lure of
Larry Wilburn's ranch, but it's making some of the neighbors
nervous.
   ``I've gotten some phone calls from a few people who have heard
rumors about lion hunts and are worried about them,'' said Jack
White, a Cove councilman. ``Their main fear, of course, is what if
the lion gets loose and starts roaming.''
   Wilburn says his lions are no more dangerous than the wild boars
already living in the boggy area of Southeast Texas.
   ``My lions have been raised in captivity,'' said Wilburn, who
offers 20 species including deer, sheep and antelope for hunting at
his three ranches.
   He buys his lions from people who bought them when they were
``cute, cuddly cubs.''
   ``The ones I get are usually past their prime,'' said Wilburn.
``They're old and mean and not useful any more. The zoos usually
can't use them and they were destined for the gas chamber when I
get them.''
   Some residents don't like the idea of having lions in the area.
   ``I'm very nervous about anybody turning loose a lion in the
marsh,'' said Chambers County Clerk Beanie Rowland. ``Now I'll be
worrying whenever I hear my dog bark or my grandchildren go to play
in the back yard.''
   The hunts are conducted on a 400-acre area in the marsh called
Lawrence Island, which is surrounded by bayous, canals and
waterways, Wilburn said.
   State officials says it is legal to hold a lion hunt on private
property, but not on the adjoining federal land.
   Wilburn said he has booked six lion hunts in the last year.
   ``Those who do it usually have a lot of money to play with,''
said Wilburn, who charges $2,500 to $3,500.

<TEXT>
   Robert Moriarty, who once flew a
single-engine plane through the opening at the base of the Eiffel
Tower, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison on a
drug-conspiracy charge.
   Chief Circuit Judge Dwight Geiger also ordered a $250,000 fine
and 15 years probation.
   ``I'm very upset ... We're going to take this case to appeal,''
Moriarty said after the sentencing Thursday.
   He criticized Geiger's decision not to dismiss the verdict of
the jury that found him guilty in February of conspiring to traffic
in cocaine but innocent of a cocaine-trafficking charge.
   ``I'm going up to the `Big House' with the biggest sentence
anybody has gotten in this case,'' said the 41-year-old pilot from
Coconut Grove, who has been held in the Martin County Jail since
his arrest in October 1986.
   ``I just got sentenced to 15 years in prison for something I
didn't do.''
   In May, Moriarty was found guilty of cocaine conspiracy and
trafficking charges in connection with the discovery of nearly
1,000 pounds of cocaine on a plane that landed on a grass airstrip
in Port Mayaca on the rim of Lake Okeechobee.
   Evidence on the plane and the testimony of the co-pilot led
authorities to Moriarty.
   Defense attorney Robert Watson told of Moriarty's numerous
honors during his military career, including service as an F4
Phantom pilot in Vietnam, in trying to persuade Geiger not to
impose a longer sentence than the minimum mandatory 15-year term.
   Moriarty also set a world record for a trans-Atlantic flight in
a single-engine plane, Watson wrote in a letter to the judge.
   Moriarty made his stunt flight through the Eiffel Tower at the
end of that record-setting flight in 1984.

<HEAD>Brazilian Fly Released to Control Spreading Crop Pest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A red-eyed Brazilian fly was turned
loose Friday in an experimental effort to control the mole cricket,
which chews up $47 million worth of crops and lawns each year.
   The first release of 250 fly pupae in an Alachua County pasture
will probably be followed by others throughout the summer, said
Howard Frank, director of the project at the University of
Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.
   ``We're optimistic, but the whole thing is a big experiment,''
said Frank.
   The mole cricket, which probably arrived by ship from South
America, damages vegetation by tunneling through it.
   The pest is now spreading into Georgia, Alabama and South
Carolina, Frank said
   The Brazilian fly, about the size of a house fly, comes to the
mating call of male mole crickets, and lays her living larvae on or
near the singer. The larvae then burrow into the male and his mates.
   Ten days later the mole cricket is dead, said Tom Walker, the
IFAS entomologist who will monitor the progress of the Brazilian
fly.
   ``We should know in a year if the larvae are surviving,'' said
Frank. ``And in two years we'll have a reasonable idea of whether
it's a success.''
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture granted permission to release
the flies after laboratory tests demonstrated they only attack mole
crickets.
   The fly is the third biocontrol agent that IFAS has unleashed in
Florida against mole crickets.
   A wasp that subdues mole crickets but does not sting people was
the first. Turned loose in 1981 near Fort Lauderdale, the colony is
holding its own there. They mainly attack a tropical mole cricket
that is only a pest in South Florida, however.
   Nematodes, microscopic worms, were released in 1985 and 1986 in
several Alachua pastures. Offspring are still there and seem to
have caused a decline in mole cricket populations at the release
sites, but Frank says the nematodes are harder to handle than the
Brazilian fly.

<HEAD>Iraq's Recapture Of Faw Gives Iraq Big Political Lift</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's recapture of the Faw peninsula from
Iran this week provided Baghdad with a major political victory,
despite the limited military value of the dusty uninhabited
wasteland.
   The successful attack on the peninsula, extending from southern
Iraq into the Persian Gulf, robbed Tehran of a key bargaining chip
that could be used if the countries ever negotiate for peace.
   ``It's insignificant as far as the military situation is
concerned,'' a Baghdad-based Western diplomat said of the Iraqi
victory. ``But psychologically, it had been the needle in their
flesh.''
   The Iraqis are, not unnaturally, hailing their recovery of Faw
as one of their greatest military triumphs in the 7{-year-old
Persian Gulf war. While analysts doubt that, they concede it has
given Baghdad a big morale boost.
   The elite Presidential Guard and the 7th Army Corps smashed
through Iranian lines north of Faw on Sunday. By Monday afternoon
they had seized full control of the peninsula that dominates Iraq's
two main outlets to the gulf, the Shatt Al-Arab and the Khor
Abdullah waterways.
   Iran captured about 12 miles of the peninsula in February 1986,
stunning Iraq, which failed in repeated bloody counterattacks to
retake the flatlands. Iran renamed Faw city, an abandoned refinery
town, Al-Zahra and held a wrestling tournament there last year to
emphasize its grip.
   Although Iran still occupies other small chunks of Iraqi
territory along the 730-mile border, Faw was its prize.
   The loss of Faw ``turned Iraq into a landlocked country ... and
Iraq likes to think of itself as a gulf country,'' said a Western
analyst in Baghdad, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The war began in September 1980 partly because of a
long-standing dispute between Iran and Iraq over who controls the
Shatt Al-Arab, the gulf outlet of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
Faw gave the the Iranians dominance on both sides of the waterway.
   Iraq was thinking of Faw when it insisted on full application of
a measure from the United Nations Security Council that demanded
that the two countries withdraw to pre-war international boundaries
as part of a cease-fire, the analyst said.
   Iran also had Faw largely in mind when it balked at the U.N.
measure.
   ``It was the most important card the Iranians held'' in the
scuffle for position over a possible peace settlement, the analyst
said.
   The Faw battle also broke Iraq's strategy of static defense,
whereby Iraqi troops would sit behind formidable protection and
wait for Iranian attacks.
   The Iraqis, who invaded Iran in 1980, had stuck to that strategy
since they were driven back across the border in 1981 so much so
that many analysts had doubted they were capable of mounting an
offensive.
   The Iranians may have thought the same and let their guard drop.
   Iraq's only significant assault into Iran in recent years was in
May 1986, when its troops captured the deserted and weakly held
border town of Mehran on the central front in retaliation for the
loss of Faw.
   But victory turned quickly to debacle when Iran regained the
town a month later, capturing much of the Iraqi force that had
failed to seize the high ground around it.
   Reporters who toured the Faw battleground immediately after its
recapture found few signs of the fierce hand-to-hand combat that
normally characterize Iranian fighting.
   There were few bodies lying around and only a handful of damaged
tanks and artillery pieces to be seen.
   Iraqi officers told reporters that Iran had about three
divisions on the peninsula, between 10,000 and 25,000 men, far less
than the 50,000 previously thought to be based there.
   Faw's chief strategic value was that it bottled up Iraq's small
navy by lining artillery along Iraq's only remaining outlet to the
gulf, the Khor Abdullah. The Shatt Al-Arab to the east had been
closed since the early days of the war.
   But even that had only a limited value since the Iraqi Navy has
played little part in the war since its early phases.
   Faw also gave Iran a platform closer to Kuwait from which it
could launch missile attacks. Iran has accused Kuwait of aiding
Iraq.
   The diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran
apparently captured an Iraqi missile battery on Faw which it used
to fire Chinese-made Silkworm missiles at Kuwait, whose capital is
50 miles southwest of the peninsula.
   But Iran showed Tuesday that it could hit Kuwait from Iranian
soil when it fired a Soviet-designed Scud missile into uninhabited
desert near an oilfield.

<HEAD>Strong Warning From Slovenian Leader On Threat to Socialism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's economic crisis is
threatening its socialist system and needs an infusion of new
ideas, a high-ranking Communist Party official said Friday.
   ``The depth of the unvanquished crisis in many places brings in
question the issue of socialism as a whole,'' said Milan Kucan, the
leader of the Slovenian Communist Party. ``Changes, radical ones,
are more than necessary.'' Kucan made the comments during a speech
to 421 delegates to the provincial party conference, which opened
Friday.
   He called on the party to allow open debate ``without
restoration of the classical, bourgeois parliamentary political
parties'' of Western democracy.
   Yugoslavia is a single-party Communist state.
   An increasing number of critics, including authors, philosophers
and sociologists from Serbia, have been pressing for introduction
of a multi-party system in the country as a way out of its current
economic and social crisis.
   Communists in Slovenia, the country's most prosperous republic,
have been the most outspoken in offering unorthodox solutions to
the country's problems, including introduction of a more
market-oriented economy and closer ties with Western Europe.
   Yugoslavia has a $20 billion foreign debt. Unemployment is at 15
percent. Living standards are declining and inflation is at 170
percent.
   Joze Knez, vice-chairman of Slovenian Parliament, on Wednesday
called on the federal government to resign because of its failure
to cope with the crisis.
   The current Yugoslav constitution, adopted in 1974 during the
rule of the late communist leader Josip Broz Tito, created a sistem
of eight virtually independent communist parties, one within each
of the country's six constituent republics and two provinces.
   The Central Committee of the party excercises nominal control
over its regional branches, but is in fact often reduced to serving
as a forum where regional differences are aired.

   An explosion destroyed a grain elevator
today, killing at least two people and injuring at least two
others, officials said.
   ``It felt like the building was falling in. It was bad,'' said
Pam Adams, a clerk at Stonitsch Construction Co., near the ADM
Growmark elevator. She said the shaking lasted only a few seconds.
   Will County Emergency Services Director Don Gould said three
people were reported dead and four missing.
   But Joliet police Sgt. James Albritton said reports he had from
the scene indicated that two people had been killed, three injured
and ``possibly three (more) missing.
   ``Fire department personnel are searching for the missing
people,'' Albritton said.
   Police reported receiving a call of an explosion at 10:54 a.m.
from the elevator, said Albritton.
   ``We heard it, our whole building shook,'' said Ingrid Warren, a
secretary-bookkeeper at Stonitsch Construction.
   ``All I can do is confirm that there was an explosion at a river
elevator in Joliet,'' said spokesman Dick Burket at ADM offices in
Decatur.
   The ADM Growmark elevator is located on the banks of the
Illinois River, he said. It loads barges that travel on the river.
   Two people were taken to St. Joseph Medical Center, one in fair
condition, the other in good condition, said spokeswoman Linda
Hulbert. She said she believed both were outside the facility when
the explosion occurred.

   A seashell collector found a bundle
of 800 papers about the U.S. nuclear submarine fleet at a naval
base in Scotland, a newspaper reported today.
   But the U.S. Navy said the papers apparently found near the Holy
Loch base contained no classified information.
   The Scotsman, based in Edinburgh, said the papers contained
details of the running costs and the maintenance of the 10
Lafayette and Benjamin Franklin class submarines operating out of
Holy Loch, the largest U.S. submarine base outside the United
States.
   The 10 submarines are armed with Poseidon and Trident nuclear
missiles.
   A woman collecting shells at Helensburgh, seven miles from the
high security base, picked up a black plastic bag that contained
the bundle of papers, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper said the papers contained financial details on the
refitting of three submarines at the base, the amount given for
servicing and engineering at Holy Loch and items needed for the
submarines and for the submarine support vessel USS Simon Lake.
   In a statement issued in Washington, the Navy said the bag was
``routine refuse that fell ashore by accident and contains only
routine maintenance and logistics documents.''
   ``It is easy to understand, given the incomplete and cryptic
nature of the data in the refuse, how it could have been
misinterpreted,'' it said.
   Holy Loch is the principal U.S. submarine base in Europe and is
of key strategic importance to the Western NATO defense alliance.
   The base is wholly operated by the U.S. Navy, which employs more
than 1,700 personnel there.

<TEXT>
   An effort by two bookstores to get a list
of books used at Baylor University is turning into a legal battle
that could force the private school to open most of its records and
files to public scrutiny.
   State Sen. Carl Parker, chairman of the Senate Education
Committee, has asked the attorney general to issue an opinion on
whether the Baptist university in Waco is a governmental body
subject to the Texas Open Records Act. He notes that the university
receives $3.6 million in state aid in the form of tuition grants.
   If Baylor is declared a governmental body because it accepts
state funds, Parker then asks whether the textbook list should be
made available to the public under the state Open Records Act.
   So far, Baylor officials have refused to give the textbook list
to Bear Bookstore and the University Bookstore, two private stores
off-campus.
   Although Parker's legal inquiry is narrowly focused on the
textbook issue, it could affect all Texas colleges affiliated with
religious denominations, said Carol McDonald, president of the
Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas Inc., a group of 39
private schools.
   Abner McCall, Baylor president emeritus, said: ``If he can get
that (textbook list), he can get most of the records out here.''
   Under current interpretations of the Open Records Act, private
schools such as Baylor are not obligated to make records and files
available to the public.
   ``The state shouldn't be able to look at all the records of any
private organization,'' McCall said.
   In a legal brief filed with Attorney General Jim Mattox, Baylor
lawyer Newton Jones of Dallas argued that Baylor isn't a
governmental body because it is ``not supported in whole or in part
by public funds.''
   Funds from the Texas Equalization Grant and Student Incentive
Grant programs are sent to students, not the university, Jones said.

   The Soviet Union exploded a nuclear device at the
Semipalatinsk testing range of the Central Asian Republic of
Kazakhstan, the official Tass news agency said Friday.
   Tass said the purpose of the blast was to test research on the
physics of nuclear explosions. It was the fourth test this year.
   The explosion had a yield of up to 20 kilotons, equivalent to
20,000 tons of TNT. Tass gave no other details of the test.
   The Soviet government wants to ban all nuclear tests, but U.S.
officials have resisted on the basis that they do not agree with
proposed Soviet enforcement procedures.
   American scientists visited the Semipalatinsk range in January
to gather information that may be used in verifying U.S.-Soviet
compliance with a future test ban. Similar exchanges with Soviets
visiting test sites in America are planned.

   A 19-year-old man who was kidnapped at
knifepoint with his girlfriend in 1987 has been charged with raping
three young women and sexually assaulting two others.
   Dino R. Deantonio was charged Thursday with three counts of
rape, three of kidnapping, second-degree sexual assault and
robbery, said Capt. John Power. Deanton were convicted in January and sentenced
last month
to life in prison.
   Police said the rapes and sexual assaults with which Deantonio
is charged all happened in the Providence College area over the
last three months.
   Deantonio was identified as a suspect through a description of
the assailant's car, Power said.
   Deantonio was arraigned in Providence District Court before
Judge Antonio SaoBento and ordered held without bail. His
girlfriend attended the arraignment.
   Deantonio was ordered held without bail. SaoBento granted a
prosecution request that Deantonio be held in protective custody
since he testified against Ferrara and Thompson.

   Police arrested 10 people in a raid on a
Mafia summit meeting at a seaside villa, but at least six others
escaped, police said Friday.
   Police seized a bulletproof car, a bulletproof vest, a revolver,
ammunition and large amounts of stolen goods during the Thursday
night raid. Six men and four women were arrested on charges of
Mafia association.
   Investigators said they are believed to be part of an organized
crime family linked to Salvatore Pillera, the reputed head of the
Catania Mafia who is currently on trial in Turin.
   Six or seven other people fled shortly before agents burst into
the villa, police said.
   In recent weeks, two people have been shot dead in the Catania
area controlled by the gang, police said.

   A prosecutor says he foresees no major hurdles in
holding a third trial for a man twice sentenced to death in the
kidnap, rape and killing of his niece more than 10 years ago.
   The death sentence of John Charles Zimmerman Jr., 41, was thrown
out Wednesday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
   Zimmerman was convicted of capital murder in 1977 and again in
1979 for the death of 10-year-old Ramona Ann Abner of Jacinto City.
   Former assistant Harris County District Attorney Ken Sparks, who
prosecuted Zimmerman at both trials, was angry about the reversal.
   ``The responsibility for this reversal rests squarely on the
shoulders of Allan R. Jamail and the Jacinto City Police Department
for the way they mishandled the confession,'' he said.
   Jamail, former Jacinto City police chief and now mayor of the
town in the Houston area, denied forcibly obtaining Zimmerman's
confession to the March 24, 1977, slaying and said Sparks ``better
be able to back up those statements.''
   Jamail called the conviction reversal a ``miscarriage of
justice.''
   ``This has been painful on Mrs. Abner. Her daughter would be 18
had it not been for Zimmerman,'' he said. ``There's enough evidence
to support the death penalty again.''
   In its 8-1 decision, the appeals court said the second trial
judge improperly allowed into evidence letters written by Zimmerman
to his wife, Sherry, after he was in custody. The letters, in which
Zimmerman admitted killing his niece, wound up in the hands of his
mother-in-law, who sent them to another daughter who forwarded them
to investigators.
   The court ruled that the letters were confidential communication
between husband and wife and that their introduction as evidence
violated a provision of the law that one spouse cannot give adverse
testimony against another.
   Prosecutors will ask for a rehearing, Harris County District
Attorney John Holmes said, because of changes in the so-called
``spousal-immunity statute,'' which now permits such adverse
testimony.
   Holmes said he expects no problems in trying the case again
because most of the state's witnesses are current or former law
enforcement officers.
   According to trial testimony, Zimmerman took Ramona, a
third-grader, from school on the day of the killing, telling a
teacher's aide there was a family emergency.
   The next day, he led police to the girl's body. A 10-inch
butcher knife was found where he said he had thrown it.
   Zimmerman made oral and written confessions to the crime but
later alleged he had been slapped, hit and shocked with a cattle
prod by Jacinto City police.
   A Jacinto City police dispatcher testified that she typed
Zimmerman's confession and that Jamail told Zimmerman everything to
say. She also said she saw an officer hit Zimmerman.
   Jacinto City Council fired Jamail and a federal grand jury later
indicted him and two other officers on charges they abused two
prisoners questioned in the Abner case. All three were acquitted in
1979.

<TEXT>
   The family of an American engineer killed by
Contras in Nicaragua last year boarded a plane Friday to be in that
Central American nation on the anniversary of his death.
   The family of Benjamin Linder took along a check for $250,000 in
donations for a project he was working on when he was fatally shot
April 28, 1987.
   ``Nicaragua is our connection to Ben right now,'' said his
brother, John Linder, just before the family from Portland, Ore.,
boarded a Lacsa flight to Managua.
   Traveling with John Linder were his parents, David and Elisabeth
Linder, and his sister Miriam.
   The family will attend activities commemorating Linder's death
while he worked on a rural electrification project, and are taking
with them the fruits of a yearlong fund-raising campaign.
   Family members visited 220 cities across the country to collect
the money, John Linder said.
   ``His death brought the war home to the U.S. in a very personal
way,'' said the brother. ``Many people told us they had simply
never heard our side of the story before.''
   The family filed a $50 million wrongful death suit Wednesday
against Contra leaders headquartered here, charging that Linder,
27, was shot point-blank in the head by anti-Sandinista guerrillas
after he was wounded in a gun battle.
   The Contras have acknowledged Linder's death but have said only
that it occurred in the middle of a battle.
   The Linders have said one reason for their suit and the national
campaign is to end U.S. backing of the Contra rebels fighting
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   The suit ``will help bring to light who the real people
responsible for his death are,'' said John Linder. ``It was part of
a policy, a policy that begins right here in the United States.''

   Republican National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf
Jr. and former television evangelist Pat Robertson called for party
unity, but discord was obvious as the Nevada state GOP convention
convened Friday.
   Rural-county delegates expressed dismay at what one termed
``Gestapo tactics'' by Robertson's Nevada organizer, Steve Wark,
who helped engineer a Robertson takeover of the state party
leadership.
   But Wark said the gripes were unwarranted, and he said he had
been ``begging people to stay involved'' rather than telling them
they were being replaced by Robertson supporters.
   Fahrenkopf told the convention that Republicans who think a GOP
presidency is certain this election year ``are dead wrong.'' He
said Democrats are in a do-or-die campaign and will use smear
tactics to assure a victory.
   He accused Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis of duplicity
in his statements on issues including taxation, defense spending
and law-and-order legislation.
   The Republican chief also said it's incomprehensible to him that
Jesse Jackson, ``the most radical candidate for the presidency
ever,'' could be running a close second behind Dukakis.
   Fahrenkopf said, ``The old and the new faces in our party must
unite and work to defeat our common enemy,'' which he described as
liberals who dominate the Democratic Party.
   Fahrenkopf said after his speech he wasn't embarrassed that a
Robertson-dominated delegation would come from Nevada to the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans this summer, despite
the fact that Vice President George Bush apparently will be the
presidential nominee.
   Robertson echoed Fahrenkopf's remarks about uniting to defeat
Democrats, winning applause from most of the state convention
delegates with the obvious exception of a crowd of rural delegates.
   He called for a return to quality education based on moral
teachings and an end to progressive education ``that is getting
progressively worse.''
   And Robertson also spoke against ``drug dealers, organized crime
and radical homosexual activists'' and said he was opposed to
legalized abortion or any efforts to block help to the nation's
elderly.
   Many of the delegates began singing ``God Bless America'' as
Robertson wrapped up his 25-minute speech and left the room.
   Delegate Curtis Patrick, a member of the state GOP executive
committee and a former state party chairman, accused Wark of
``Gestapo tactics'' in changing party rules and cutting off rural
delegates from participation.
   Patrick said an executive committee session late Thursday turned
into a shouting match after Wark told ``Old Guard'' Republicans
they were out of power.
   This weekend, the Republicans will finish picking a 20-member
delegation to the national GOP convention. At least 16 of those
national convention delegates will be Robertson delegates.

<TEXT>
   A deposed and exiled Honduran
military chief charged with overseeing death squads is under house
arrest after he returned from the United States as a born-again
Christian.
   Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, who cooperated in U.S. policy against
leftist Nicaragua, headed Hondura's armed forces from 1982 until he
was disarmed, handcuffed and put on a plane out of the country by
mutinous subordinates March 31, 1984.
   The former general returned April 9 from Miami, where he has
lived for the past four years. On Tuesday he was placed under house
arrest in his luxurious home in the Florencia Norte suburb of this
capital.
   Alvarez, who was dishonorably discharged and stripped of his
rank in an unprecedented display of his comrades' ire, is charged
in connection with the disappearance of about 130 suspected
leftists and the killings of about 30 others.
   ``If anyone thinks they have evidence against me, let them take
it to the courts,'' he told journalists at his home the day after
his arrival. ``I have found tranquillity, and fear nothing and no
one except God.''
   Alvarez, 50, said some of his erstwhile subordinates may have
kidnapped or killed suspected subversives, ``and now it's being
placed at my feet.''
   The ex-general's wife and five children remain in Miami and plan
to join him in June.
   That is, unless Criminal Court Judge Saul Suazo Lara, who is
hearing Alvarez' case, takes the unlikely step of ordering him
jailed. Suazo must decide next week whether to imprison Alvarez on
the basis of available evidence or dismiss the case.
   Jurists say the charges will likely be dropped. They say that
even if there were evidence against him, Alvarez would benefit from
a late-1984 amnesty preventing prosecution for such crimes.
   An Associated Press reporter went to Alvarez' grand two-story
home in an effort to speak with him. But a guard who relayed the
request returned to say the former commander decided to make no
further comment to the press.
   Alvarez told journalists the day after his arrival: ``Those who
threw me out of this country thought they were throwing me in the
garbage. But they threw me into the arms of the Lord and made me a
new man.''
   A former Roman Catholic, he said last year in Miami that he
converted to evangelical Christianity in 1985 after rereading the
Bible. He described the vivid, anguished recollection of all the
wrongs he'd ever committed and hours of uncontrollable sobbing.
   But mothers of the victims of death squads that emerged under
the staunchly anti-communist general reject his professed
conversion.
   ``He cannot hide behind the Bible,'' said Liduina Hernandez,
whose 23-year-old son Enrique disappeared in 1982. ``Christ died
for the truth, so let Alvarez begin by telling the truth about what
happened to our sons and daughters.''
   Mrs. Hernandez is president of the Committee of Relatives of the
Disappeared, one of two rights groups pressing the case against
Alvarez. She and several other mothers commented at a press
conference Wednesday.
   It was under Alvarez' command that the Reagan administration
consolidated its use of Honduras in the effort to topple
Nicaragua's leftist government. U.S.-funded rebels established base
camps in Honduras along the Nicaraguan border and the Contras waged
most of their 6-year campaign from there.
   The U.S. also established the Regional Military Training Center
in northern Honduras during Alvarez' tenure. The center, now
defunct, was used mainly to train government forces from El
Salvador in counterinsurgency techniques.
   A year before his expulsion, Alvarez formed the Association for
Progress in Honduras, a group of politicians and business leaders.
The organization was seen as a vehicle for the general's political
ambitions, widely believed to include the presidency.
   But Alvarez told journalists after coming back that once his
legal problems are resolved, he wants to dedicate himself to a
``normal and private life'' removed from politics. He said last
week he would like to settle down in the northern coastal town of
La Ceiba and find some sort of business ``to earn me my beans.''

<HEAD>Proponents Say Coin Redesign Would Yield Billions For Treasury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of redesigning the nation's pennies,
nickels dimes and quarters held out the prospect Friday that
excited coin collectors would hand the Treasury a multi-billion
dollar, deficit-reducing, windfall profit.
   But the director of the U.S. Mint, testifying before the Senate
Banking Commttee, predicted only small-change proceeds ranging in
the millions of dollars, not billions.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said any profit from a redesigned
coin would be welcome.
   ``I suspect that glimmer of black ink in our deficit-plagued
world is, in itself, adequate reason for passage of this bill,'' he
said.
   Sixty-one senators and 90 House members have co-sponsored
legislation authorizing the most sweeping redesign of the nation's
coinage since the early years of the century.
   The bill would require a complete redesign of the tails of the
coins while reserving the heads for the five presidents presently
displayed there.
   While the presidential portraits might themselves be somewhat
redesigned, the coins would retain their present size, shape and
color.
   The bill requires the design of the tail of the quarter to carry
for two years a design commemorating the bicentennial of the
Constitution.
   Cranston said he would like to make some changes in the plan and
said he will introduce a pair of amendments to do that.
   He would reserve the face of two of the coins for a symbolic
design and forbid their use to portray any person, living or dead.
   That would mean that two of the five presidents now so honored _
Lincoln on the penny, Jefferson on the nickel, Roosevelt on the
dime, Washington on the quarter and John F. Kennedy on the
half-dollar _ would lose their places in the nation's pockets and
purses.
   Cranston said no president was featured on the nation's coins
until 1909 when Abraham Lincoln was granted the honor on his 100th
birthday.
   Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and
Kennedy got their coins within a year of their deaths, Cranston
said.
   Cranston said he would also offer an amendment to enhance the
value of the redesigned coins as educational tools by directing
that they be designed as symbols of such democratic principles as
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, due process of law, trial
by jury, the right to vote and the separation of powers.
   ``Coins are the most tangible symbols of our nation in our daily
lives,'' Cranston said. ``We touch them, examine them, carry them
around in our pockets and purses in all our waking hours. ...
People _ particularly young people _ will look at our coins and
learn what they stand for.''
   Diane Wolf, a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts who has
been campaigning for redesigned coins for more than a year, has
said the change could result in a $2.3 billion profit over six
years.
   The bill requires all profits be used to reduce the deficit.
   David C. Harper, editor of Numismatic News, a coin collector's
magazine, testified that the $2.3 billion estimate resulted from
his calculation of profits of the release of the coins at face
value compared to their relatively low production prices and the
separate sales of mint and proof sets to collectors.
   ``It is clear to me the government will make money on design
changes,'' he said. ``Only the size of the profit is undetermined.''
   But Donna Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, had far lower
estimates.
   ``Embellished revenue estimates of $2.3 billion have been cited
and some have looked to coin redesign as a panacea for budget
deficits,'' she said.
   ``Based on analyses of past demand patterns we estimate $224
million in additional ... receipts will be generated in the first
six years of the new designs and $18 million in additional profits
over the same period'' from sales to coin collectors.''
   The mint director suggested that if a decision is made to change
the design of U.S. coins the changes should be made over a six-year
period with a new coin being issued at the beginning of each year.

   A 125-year-old house that was the national
headquarters of the women's suffrage movement in the early 1900s is
facing demolition, despite opposition by historians and city
officials.
   ``Everyone is just sick about it,'' said Councilwoman Virginia
Bufano, who has been researching city codes to see what might be
done to save the Harriet Taylor Upton house.
   Clifton Anderson, one of the owners of the two-story wooden
structure, said Thursday he will seek a demolition permit and plans
to sell the lot for development. Anderson said he has mixed
emotions, but has been unable to sell the house.
   ``We saved this place 12 years ago when we bought it and
preserved it,'' said Anderson.
   Mrs. Upton, a historian, was a national leader in the women's
suffrage movement. From 1903 to 1910, the house served as the
national headquarters of the National Women's Suffragist
Association, of which Mrs. Upton was treasurer.
   The group was a leader in the fight for women's rights,
including the 19th Amendment which granted women the right to vote.
   Anderson said several people are interested in obtaining pieces
of the structure and a buyer is interested in the lot for an office
building.
   Anderson and Richard Stoerkel bought the 14-room house in 1976
and began restoration. They put it on the market several years ago
with an asking price of $140,000.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha's new
plan to expand blacks' political role was denounced Friday as vague
and inadequate, but even some critics credited him with courage.
   For all their limitations in the eyes of black activists, the
proposals sent a clear message to extreme-right whites that Botha
was willing to risk their wrath in pursuit of his version of reform.
   Parliament members of the far-right Conservative Party, victor
over Botha's National Party in three recent by-elections, depicted
the president's plan as dangerous and said he was ``selling out the
white man.''
   ``Black power is lying in wait for you,'' said the
Conservatives' leader, Andries Treurnicht. ``You're walking
straight towards it.''
   In a speech to Parliament on Thursday, Botha proposed black
participation in Cabinet-level policymaking and on the electoral
college that selects the president. He suggested that blacks, who
now may vote only in local elections, could select their
representatives in regional balloting.
   Black and white moderates criticized Botha's vagueness and his
reluctance to bring blacks into Parliament. But they praised his
willingness to challenge the far right, which consists primarily of
the president's fellow Afrikaners.
   ``As limited as the state president's thought is, it will be
used against him by the far right which he now tentatively begins
to defy,'' said Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Colin Eglin, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal
Party, softened his usual denunciations of Botha to say his party,
although skeptical, wished the president success in starting
negotiations with leaders of the nation's 26 million blacks.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts,
schools and health services.
   More militant anti-apartheid leaders were unimpressed by Botha's
speech, which did not address blacks' fundamental demands for full
voting rights and abolition of apartheid laws.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu described Botha's proposals as
``slight adjustments to the evil system'' of apartheid.
   It won't help if the government merely ``moved furniture around,
because the room would remain the same,'' Tutu said at the close of
a four-day visit to Britain.
   ``Reform will not come by `big master' throwing to us crumbs of
conscience that fall from his table,'' the black archbishop said.
``It will happen when all the people in South Africa are able to
determine the menu together when they sit at the same table.''
   Botha, returning to Parliament on Friday to explain aspects of
the presidential budget, veered from his text to defend his
political proposals.
   Blacks, he said, ``cannot be wished away abracadabra'' as the
conservatives might hope. He said blacks would have to be brought
into the government and given a voice in choosing a president.
   But Botha also stressed that white voters have a say on the
proposal to include blacks in the electoral college.
   A referendum on this issue would present whites with a clear
choice between the National Party and the Conservatives, who oppose
any concessions to blacks and favor a strengthening of the
apartheid laws that create a racially segregated society.
   The Conservatives won 26 percent of the vote in the white
general election a year ago, and they are predicting further gains
in nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October.
   The vast majority of Conservative supporters are Afrikaners, the
mainly Dutch-descended whites who traditionally have been loyal
National Party backers.
   Some political analysts in the country say Botha has decided to
abandon the far-right Afrikaners in hopes he can attract enough
support from English-speaking whites to offset the loss. About 60
percent of the 5 million whites are Afrikaners and the rest are
predominantly English-speakers.

<TEXT>
   A former FBI agent told senators Friday that
he almost became the first bureau member initiated into La Cosa
Nostra, but his six-year undercover assignment was ended abruptly
due to a gangster civil war.
   Joseph D. Pistone said he would have become a ``made'' member of
New York City's Bonanno family in December 1981, but he was pulled
out of the mob by his FBI superiors after he was ordered to kill a
gangster from a rival faction.
   ``The FBI felt _ and so did I _ that this was a good time for
getting out, because everybody was being killed,'' Pistone said.
   But for a brief time, Pistone said, he sought permission to
continue the assignment so he could make FBI history.
   FBI spokeswoman Kathy Bradford said that to this day, no agent
has ever penetrated deep enough into a mob family to be a ``made''
member rather than an associate.
   Pistone testified from behind a screen before the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The panel's chairman,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the retired agent has been relocated
from New York and changed his appearance.
   Members of the Sicilian Mafia and La Cosa Nostra in this country
have used the screen for protection in recent hearings. The
committee is looking at the state of organized crime 25 years after
ex-mobster Joe Valachi testified for the first time about the inner
workings of mob families.
   Pistone, who wrote a book about his life as gangster Donnie
Brasco, said the New York mob was so upset when it learned his real
identity, that some of his former allies were murdered, and new
rules were instituted to thwart future undercover penetrations.
   ``They have reinstituted the requirement that before someone is
made a soldier, he will have to `make his bones.' That is, he will
have to kill someone,'' Pistone said.
   ``In addition, they are now requiring two `wiseguys' (organized
crime members) to vouch with their own lives for the new member
rather than as before, when only one did so.''
   The mob had reason to be upset. Pistone's subsequent testimony
resulted in more than 200 indictments and more than 100 convictions
of organized crime members.
   Pistone said there was a ``surprising similarity'' between the
workings of organized crime families and terrorist organizations.
   The families were broken down into small, separate cells called
crews. A strict ``need to know'' policy was enforced, with no one
asking what other members were doing _ and not giving each other
their last names.
   Pistone described the life of a Cosa Nostra soldier in New York
as routine and unglamorous, with most of his time consumed trying
to make money for himself and his mob family.
   ``They didn't think or talk much about their wives, girlfriends,
families, hobbies,'' Pistone said.
   ``Every day you would have to check in with your captain. ...
There was no such thing as taking a couple of weeks off for
vacation, unless you first had your captain's approval.''
   Pistone said mobsters ``believe in God, not in going to church,
but they believe in the church. Killing was part of the business.
Every Mafia member has in his head that he may be wacked out
(killed).''
   In other testimony, the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia said the
Cosa Nostra was ``on the run'' in his city, with most of the
organized crime leadership under indictment or in prison.
   However, Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. said that despite the successful
prosecutions, the mob was ``down but not out'' in Philadelphia.
   The reputed current boss of the Philadelphia family, Nicodemo
Scarfo, was convicted on extortion and conspiracy charges and
sentenced in August 1987 to 14 years in prison.
   He currently is on trial in Philadelphia, along with seven Cosa
Nostra members, on charges of killing a former ``capo'' in the
Scarfo organized crime family.
   At present, most active members of the Philadelphia-South Jersey
Cosa Nostra ``are either under indictment, in custody, or both,''
he said.

   Sixty of Berlin's famed linden trees will be
planted in Kensington Gardens to help replace trees uprooted by
freak gales last October.
   The young, hand-picked lindens, already up to 20 feet high, will
be flown here by a Royal Air Force plane and planted at a ceremony
Monday. Among those to attend the planting will be Jurgen Starnick,
a West Berlin senator, and the Earl of Caithness, minister of state
at the Department of the Environment, said a statement from the
West German Embassy.
   The project is being paid for by the West Berlin boroughs of
Wilmersdorf, Neukoelln, Charlottenburg, Steglitz and Schoeneberg,
three of which are twinned with London boroughs, the statement said.
   It said a plaque on Kensington Gardens' Jubilee Alley, where the
trees are being planted, will read: ``Presented to the citizens of
London as a token of friendship by the citizens and Senate of
Berlin.''
   The Oct. 16 storm damaged or destroyed 10 percent of the
garden's 11,000 trees. Seventeeen people were killed in the gales,
which tool southern England by surprise.

<HEAD>HHS Wants To Transfer Administration To States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said Friday it will
soon submit a bill to transfer administration of the federal family
planning program from the Department of Health and Human Services
to the states.
   Assistant HHS Secretary Robert Windom said the shift would
enable states ``to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring
services to more appropriately and effectively meet their citizens'
family planning needs.''
   In testimony to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
health, Windom said certain federal requirements would be retained.
Among them: a ban on use of funds for abortion-related services and
priority on serving low-income families.
   Windom said that by running their own programs, states could not
only improve services but could also avoid ``burdensome
application, reporting and monitoring requirements in the current
program.''
   He said legislation proposing the shift would be introduced
``very shortly.''
   The Title X family planning program is awarding $130 million in
grants this year to 89 groups and agencies operating 4,000 clinic
sites. Last year the clinics served about 4.3 million people, most
of them low-income and about one-third of them adolescents.
   The administration is trying to put strict new abortion
limitations on grant recipients, including a prohibition on any
mention of the word by counselors and requirements for separate
records, staffs and physical facilities for groups or hospitals
that provide abortions as well as family planning.
   The regulations have been enjoined by courts in Boston, Denver
and New York as a result of lawsuits charging they are
unconstitutional. Windom said HHS regional offices have been
instructed for the time being not to implement them.

<HEAD>Police Say Gangs Are Using Homes of Elderly as Drug Houses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug dealers are either coercing or paying
off elderly people to use their homes as safe bases for narcotics
sales, authorities say.
   The statement follows the fatal shooting Wednesday night of
71-year-old L.C. Hadnott in South Central Los Angeles as police
raided his house during a drug sweep. Police said Hadnott pointed a
shotgun at officers, but his niece denied that.
   ``These rock cocaine dealers are using older people's houses to
alter the appearance of a rock house ... to give the appearance of
an innocent place,'' said Lt. William Costleigh, who's in charge of
the Police Department's central narcotics bureau. ``Rock'' is
another term for the cocaine derivative also known as crack.
   Costleigh said police have found an increasing number of elderly
people either ``coerced or paid off'' by drug dealers for the use
of their homes.
   The Police Department said Thursday that Hadnott had refused
several commands by officers to drop the shotgun he was carrying.
He then turned and pointed it at Charles Wohlfeiler, 36, a 10-year
veteran.
   ``He was in fear for his life and fired one round of a 12-gauge
shotgun, wounding Hadnott in the left arm,'' the statement said.
   Hadnott died hours later during emergency surgery at California
Medical Center.
   Friends and relatives said Thursday that Hadnott neither aimed a
gun at police nor was involved in drug dealing.
   ``They had to have made a mistake,'' said close friend Jerry
Gray, 41. ``He was an old man, just an old man.''
   Hadnott's niece, Joyce Dobbins, said officers wearing ski masks
burst through windows and stormed the house she shared with her
uncle.
   ``He did not have a gun in his hand,'' Ms. Dobbins said. ``He
was trying to ask them what was wrong. They just shot him.''
   ``She's lying,'' said Cmdr. William Booth, LAPD spokesman.
   Booth said undercover officers purchased rock cocaine at the
house just before a search warrant was sought, and again prior to
the raid. The shotgun, drug paraphernalia and a small amount of
cocaine were seized in the raid and Pamela Perkins, 26, was
arrested for investigation of selling narcotics.
   Costleigh said the officers were dressed in dark blue coveralls
and were not wearing masks, but added they sometimes pull
turtlenecks over their faces to make themselves less conspicuous.
   The house was one of three raided by police Wednesday night in
their continuing battle against street gangs and drug trafficking.

<HEAD>Swiss Ignore U.S. Protest, Accredit Iranian Who Led 1979 Embassy
Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland ignored repeated U.S. complaints
and agreed to accredit a new ambassador from Iran who was a leader
of the 1979 U.S. Embassy takeover in Tehran, the State Department
said Friday.
   The refusal by several other governments to let the Iranian,
Seyed Mohammed Malaek, serve as a diplomat in their countries also
failed to deter the Swiss from accepting him, State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   ``Our embassy to Switzerland, on instructions from the
Department of State, expressed concern over the presence and
proposed accreditation of Malaek on several occasions to the
government of Switzerland prior to his accreditation as
ambassador,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``However, the government of Switzerland agreed to accept him as
the Iranian ambassador,'' she said.
   She said Malaek's role in the takeover of the U.S. mission in
Tehran was ``sufficiently well known'' so that other nations had
declined to accept his accreditation.
   ``We considered it inappropriate for a leader of the Tehran
hostage takers who abused diplomatic immunities to be himself
accredited as an ambassador,'' she said.
   Swiss Embassy spokesman Paul Widmer said Friday that his
government ``did not have sufficient evidence'' to reject Malaek.
He said any further comment would have to come from the foreign
ministry in Bern.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the United States made known its views to Switzerland ``very
forcefully'' before Malaek's accreditation was accepted and before
he left Tehran to take up his duties in the Swiss capital, Bern, in
March.
   The official said the United States even sent a diplomat who had
been a hostage in Iran to tell Swiss officials about Malaek's role
in the takeover.
   ``It was to no avail,'' the official said.
   In May 1986, the Iranians sought to make Malaek the chief of
their 14-member diplomatic mission in London, but the British
government refused to let him take the post. In return, Iran
refused to accept Britain's nominee as its chief representative in
Tehran.
   Another State Department official said Malaek also was rejected
by Canada. He said Iran's nomination of Malaek to a post in Japan
was withdrawn after the Japanese withheld approval for a lengthy
period. Malaek's fourth turn-down was a U.S. rejection of his
attempt to come to New York as an Iranian envoy at the United
Nations, the official said.
   Malaek was especially well known to victims of the 1979-1981
U.S. Embassy seizure because he was one of the leading
interrogators among the hostage-takers, this official said.
   Foreign service officers and other Americans were held in Iran
for 444 days until their release in January 1981.
   Since then, the United States has not had diplomatic relations
with Iran and has used the Swiss embassy there to handle any
necessary dealings. Swiss diplomats, for example, were the conduits
for Washington's recent letter of protest to Tehran about a mine
that damaged the USS Samuel B. Roberts, a frigate patrolling the
Persian Gulf.

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes blasted Palestinian
guerrilla bases in seaside hills south of Beirut Friday in the
sixth such raid into Lebanon this year. Police said at least one
fighter was killed.
   Eight guerrillas were wounded in the 40-minute attack by eight
fighter-bombers that bombed and rocketed a string of targets,
police said.
   Three destroyed positions belonged to the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, which claimed
responsibility for a guerrilla's hang glider attack on an Israeli
army base in November. Six Israeli soldiers were killed and eight
wounded in that attack.
   The group is based in Damascus, Syria, and is backed by Libya.
It is headed by Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian army captain, and
maintains bases in north, east and south Lebanon.
   The Israeli army command confirmed the raid and said its planes
bombed and destroyed Arab guerrilla posts and ammunition depots
north of Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon.
   It said in a brief communique that the attacking jets returned
safely to base after scoring accurate hits on their targets.
   Guerrillas fired anti-aircraft guns and Soviet-made SAM-7
Strella missiles on the raiding jets. The Israeli planes released
hot air balloons to deflect the heat-seeking projectiles, police
said.
   They said Beirut airport was closed during the air raid.
   Lebanese police said the attacked positions stretched along a
three-mile strip of highlands overlooking the coastal towns of
Damour and Barja, about 15 miles south of the Lebanese capital.
   Eighteen rockets hit the three posts of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, including a former
sponge plant near Naameh, just north of Damour, and a two-story
building. A jeep-mounted anti-aircraft gun lay charred near a
tunnel the group transformed into an ammunition depot.
   The group's local military commander, who identified himself
only by his nom-de-guerre of Abu Riad, said the tunnel was not hit
and ammunition was spared.
   ``We are targeted because of the current uprising in occupied
territories,'' he told reporters. He was referring to Palestinian
rioting that has raged in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since Dec. 8.
   At least 48 people were killed and 63 wounded in the five
previous Israeli raids since Jan. 3, when they struck bases of the
front in Barja and the nearby costal town of Jiye, killing 26
people and wounding 30.
   The last previous attack targeted guerrilla bases in hills
southeast of Sidon on March 24. Nine people were killed and five
wounded in that attack.

<TEXT>
   A socialite dubbed the ``fugitive
temptress,'' who spent six years on the run to avoid trial on
charges she and her lover had her husband murdered, has been
captured in Washington state, authorities said Friday.
   Mary Naomi Cloud, 45, was picked up by the Benton County, Wash.,
sheriff's department late Thursday, authorities said. She had been
missing since 1982.
   ``I waited a long time for this,'' said Don Meadows, an
investigator with the Mercer County prosecutor's office. Meadows, a
former state trooper, traveled to Washington with state police Sgt.
Charles Blizzard for the arrest.
   Mrs. Cloud was charged with first-degree murder of her husband,
David, who was shot in the yard of their home as the couple
returned from a dinner party on Jan. 26, 1980. Cloud, 56, was vice
president of Carter Machinery Co.
   Authorities allege Mrs. Cloud lured her lover, John Elmer
Corprew Jr. of Roanoke, Va., into the plot to kill her husband, and
that Corprew in turn paid George Guthrie II of Roanoke $2,500 to be
the triggerman.
   Corprew testified that Mrs. Cloud ``was like a spider and I was
caught in her web. I couldn't get out.''
   Corprew was sentenced to one to five years in prison for
voluntary manslaughter as part of a plea bargain and was released
after eight months. Guthrie was convicted of first-degree murder in
1984 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was overturned
by the state Supreme Court, but he was convicted a second time and
again sentenced to life.
   After she was indicted, Mrs. Cloud moved to Huntington, where
she went to work selling cars and became romantically involved with
a former employee of her father's, Bernie D. Stanley, authorities
said. She and Stanley fled just before her trial was to begin on
May 17, 1982, officials said.
   Mrs. Cloud had put up as her bond a $50,000 building she owned
in Princeton, but prosecutors said she sold the building before
skipping town.
   Mrs. Cloud contended her husband was murdered by a masked man
who emerged from the darkness. She said the assailant demanded
money from her husband, then fired a single shotgun blast into his
face.
   Mercer County Prosecutor David Knight said he became suspicious
of her story, questioning why the masked man hadn't burgled their
house while they were away. He also questioned why Mrs. Cloud had
been spared.
   Meadows said West Virginia authorities received a tip about Mrs.
Cloud's whereabouts earlier this week and traveled to Kennewick on
Thursday. He said they showed neighbors pictures from Mrs. Cloud's
wanted poster and staked out her house once they determined the tip
was accurate.
   Meadows said no one was home when they arrived at Mrs. Cloud's
home about 7:30 p.m. He said Stanley arrived shortly after 8 p.m.,
and Mrs. Cloud showed up about 11:20 p.m. Stanley faces no charges
and was not arrested, Meadows said.

   Mrs. Child, 75, was in good condition Friday, and Cottage
Hospital spokeswoman Janet O'Neill predicted she would be released
by Wednesday.
   Mrs. Child said she fell when she tripped over a cord connected

   The 6-foot-2-inch chef issued a warning to other tall people:
``Watch your big feet.''
   Asked whether she is enjoying hospital food, the chef who gained
fame bringing classic French cooking to American households through
her books and television shows replied: ``I haven't had much of an

<TEXT>
   Hostages released from the hijacked Kuwait Airways
jet said Friday that Iran provided the sky pirates with weapons and
explosives while the plane was in northeast Iran.
   ``It's 100 percent obvious that Iran was behind the crime. Let
there be no doubt about that,'' said Khaled Nasser Zaferi, 27, a
Kuwaiti security man, who was held captive during the 16-day ordeal.
   He said a group of men boarded the plane after it landed at
Mashhad Airport in Iran on April 5 with 112 people on board.
   ``More terrorists boarded the plane at Mashhad where they
produced a submachine gun and explosives they didn't have before,''
he told The Associated Press in an interview at his home.
   They were disguised as cleaning workers, Zaferi said, ``but
their performance was so bad and unprofessional that most of us
whispered to each other, `These must be Iranian security men.'''
   Zaferi, 21 other passengers and seven crew members arrived home
from Algiers Thursday, one day after they were freed by the
hijackers at Houari Boumedienne Airport.
   The hostages included three cousins of the emir of Kuwait.
   Kuwait Airways Flight 422 was commandeered on a flight from
Bangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait. It stopped first in Mashhad where 57
hostages were freed. It then went to Larnaca, Cyprus, where 13 more
were released and two hostages were killed.
   The plane flew next to Algiers, Algeria, where one hostage was
released due to medical problems.
   On Wednesday, the 31 remaining captives were freed, and 29 flew
to Kuwait.
   The hostages had demanded the release of 17 convicted terrorists
jailed for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983,
but Kuwait had refused to do so.
   Another captive, Khaled Shamari, 32, also a businessman, said
gumnen boarded the plane in Iran.
   ``They brought arms and explosives aboard the aircraft,'' he
said. ``They also brought the plastic straps with which they tied
our hands.''
   All the hostages said they did not know that two men had been
killed in Cyprus. They said the two were taken to the front of the
aircraft and then disappeared.
   The exact deal that ended the ordeal in Algeria is not known.
But Arab diplomats have said the hostges slipped away after
surrendering the Boeing 747 and the remaining captives Wednesday.
   Western diplomats have said the hijackers went to Beirut. But
officials at Beirut airport denied they landed there.
   Friday's edition of The New York Times quoted unidentified Arab
officials as saying the hijackers were flown on a private Algerian
jet to Damascus, Syria, and were believed to have traveled overland
to Lebanon.
   The officials also were quoted as saying that, with the
exception of one Iranian, most of the hijackers were thought to be
Lebanese citizens.
   Zaferi said he knew that the men who boarded the plane where not
cleaning workers, ``because I'm an airport security man myself.
   ``But of course I never revealed my real profession to the
hijackers. I told them I am a public relations employee,'' he said.
   He said that at the start of the hijacking, a Kuwaiti passenger
next to him, Mubarak Sawagh, murmured ``God help me. I don't think
I'll survive it this time ... This is the second time that I endure
this experience.''
   Sawagh was aboard a Kuwait Airways jetliner that was hijacked to
Tehran in December 1984 by sky pirates who also demanded the
release of the terrorists jailed in Kuwait.
   The hijackers killed two American hostages before the Iranians
stormed the plane.
   Zaferi said the hijackers more pillow cases as masks. They also
moved the passengers around every few hours.
   He said they spoke in several dialects, apparently to cover
their real identity. But, Zaferi added, ``I'm certain they were all
Lebanese.''
   Shamari said: ``It was very obvious to us that the hijackers
became tense and savage after leaving Mashad.
   ``The hijackers wired the explosives to the doors of the
aircraft after landing in Larnaca,'' he said. ``We felt our doom
was sealed.''
   The former captives said they learned they would be freed
suddenly.
   ``The Algerians told us to cheer up because our ordeal was
over,'' Shamari said. ``About half an hour later, we were asked to
leave the plane.''
   Kuwait and other Arab countries praised Algeria for achieving
freedom for the hostages without additional violence. But the
United States, Britain and other Western powers criticized Algeria
for allowing the hijackers to get away.

   Israeli police stormed the holiest Islamic site
in Jerusalem to pursue hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians
after Friday noon prayers. Soldiers shot two Arabs to death in the
occupied lands.
   Police arrested more than 30 Moslem worshipers in the compound
of the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques on Temple Mount, which
is sacred to both Moslems and Jews. The hill is known in Arabic as
Harim es-Sharif, or Noble Enclosure.
   Israeli warplanes attacked Palestinian guerrilla bases in
southern Lebanon. The military command said they scored accurate
hits on targets north of Sidon and returned safely.
   Ten Palestinians were reported wounded in the Gaza Strip during
street battles between soldiers and Arabs protesting the
assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO military commander. He was
killed in Tunis last Saturday by commandos said to be Israelis, and
buried Wednesday in Damascus, Syria.
   Friday's death brings to 171 the number of Arabs killed since a
rebellion began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since capturing them
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war. An Israeli soldier and
Jewish settler also have been killed.
   About 10,000 worshipers attended prayers on the Moslem Sabbath
at Al Aqsa and the adjacent Dome of the Rock, the site from which
the prophet Mohammed is said to have ascended to heaven on his
horse.
   Afterward, hundreds of people threw stones at police, who
responded with rubber bullets and clubs, Associated Press
photographer Max Nash reported from the scene.
   He said the protesters carried black banners and Palestinian
flags, which Israel has outlawed, and chanted: ``With our spirit
and our blood, we will avenge Abu Jihad!'' _ Wazir's nom de guerre,
which means Father of the Holy War.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy put the number of arrests at more
than 30. He said officers stayed off Temple Mount until the Arabs
stoned a nearby police station, and did not enter the mosques.
   Six Arabs were reported injured by rubber bullets and beatings,
and five Israeli policemen were hurt by stones.
   It was the most violent confrontation on the sacred site since
Jan. 15, when up to 100 Palestinians were treated for the effects
of tear gas and a police officer was wounded in a knife attack.
   In the Gaza Strip, where Wazir spent part of his childhood,
Arabs waved black flags and shouted ``Abu Jihad sacrificed his
blood!''
   Israel radio said a Palestinian was killed when soldiers opened
fire in Khan Younis. Soldiers wounded 10 Arabs at the Jabaliya
refugee camp near Gaza City, and U.N. officials reported 18 injured
by rubber bullets or beatings.
   At Idna, a West Bank village near Hebron, troops shot and killed
a Palestinian when he tried to attack a border policeman with a
nail-studded club, the army said. Military officials said the
soldiers were there to search the village.
   Many mosque preachers used noon prayers on the first Sabbath in
the Moslem holy month of Ramadan to denounce Israel for Wazir's
death and urge the faitful to continue fighting occupation.
   Leaftets were distributed at West Bank mosques calling for more
protests Saturday, which underground Palestine Liberation
Organization leaders have designated a ``Day of Rage'' to mark a
week since the assassination.
   Wazir's picture appears on leaflets ordering Palestinians to
attack with ``stones, petrol bombs, metal balls and slingshots'' to
avenge his death.
   Soldiers fought protesters after Friday prayers in at least
three Gaza Strip mosques.
   Outside the Omari mosque in Gaza City, troopers hurled tear gas
canisters and fired in the air when about 200 young Palestinian
left prayers throwing rocks and chanting slogans, Arab witnesses
said.
   ``Youths gather! Gather because Abu Jihad sacrificed his
blood!'' the crowd chanted.
   In Ramallah and neighboring El Bireh in the West Bank, soldiers
guarded main intersections and patrolled the streets in trucks and
jeeps.
   Spray-painted on walls were such slogans as: ``The blood of Abu
Jihad will not go in vain.'' That one was signed by the radical
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   At the Abdel Nasser mosque in El Bireh, a preacher told 500
worshipers Israel killed Wazir to end the uprising. The Israeli
government has not confirmed it was behind the attack.
   ``They killed him to create despair among the people,'' said
Bassam Jarrar, who exhorted Palestinians to continue the rebellion.
   Jarrar said the assassination of Wazir showed Israel's
arrogance, and declared: ``They plan expulsions, but they will
harvest expulsion themselves. They plan death, but they will only
harvest revenge.''

   A group of minority students and
University of Vermont officials reached agreement Friday after
all-night negotiations to end the students' four-day occupation of
the president's office.
   The agreement calls for the university to add four to 11
minority faculty members a year for the next four years and to
double the number of minority students at the school in the next
four years.
   Minority recruitment of faculty and students has always been a
problem for the state university because of Vermont's low minority
population.
   University President Lattie Coor said he was pleased with the
agreement, which sets similar but firmer goals than his original
proposals.
   The agreement came four days after 12 to 16 students occupied
the president's wing of the administrative building, forcing
administrators out of their offices. During the occupation, the
number of students varied.
   The students ``made some concessions'' but ``did achieve all of
our goals in principle,'' said one of the students, Eric Steinberg.
   Coor said much of the agreement follows general goals he had
adopted.
   ``Right from the beginning we were on a common ground,'' said
Coor. ``Is it better because of this? Yes, (but) I don't believe it
required the dramatic step (of the occupation) to make it occur.''
   The students, who also were on a hunger strike, and the
administration were far apart until three faculty mediators were
called in Thursday night.
   Of the 8,234 undergraduates at the university, 40 are black, 162
are Asian-American and 66 are Hispanic, according to Ken Fischell,
a university official.
   ``I think we've made a tremendous impact on campus,'' said David
Jamieson of the Black Student Union. ``It's created a certain
dialogue on the issue.''
   ``There's a lot of ignorance on this campus because it's so
white,'' said student Brad Lichtenstein. ``People don't have any
idea what the real world is like.''
   Jamieson said because there are so few minority students on
campus, issues of racism and cultural diversity are not often
raised.
   ``I think the biggest problem is lack of committment and lack of
effort and passivity and ignorance concerning the student body as
regards to racism,'' he said.

<HEAD>Source Says Kidnappers Will Release Three French Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three French hostages held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslems will be freed soon, a source close to the Syrian
army command said Friday.
   ``Their release is a matter of hours. All arrangements have been
worked out,'' said the source, who spoke Friday evening on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the hostages probably would be freed in the vicinity of
the seaside Summerland Hotel in Moslem west Beirut's Jnah district,
where former French hostages Roger Auque and Jean-Louis Normandin
were released last November.
   The hotel is close to south Beirut's Shiite slums, where many of
the 22 foreigners missing in Lebanon are believed held. It also is
close to Beirut airport.
   A chartered Swissair executive jet flew to Beirut from Larnaca,
Cyprus, and a Lebanese security source said it brought Syrian
hostage negotiator Omran Adham.
   But the Lebanese police later denied that Adham was in Beirut
and said he was not aboard the executive jet.
   The plane's pilot said after returning to Larnaca, ``We went to
get the hostages but there were no hostages ready. So we came back
to spend the night here.''
   The pilot said he would fly to Beirut again early Saturday
morning. He declined to be identified.
   The Beirut weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa said earlier Friday that
contacts were under way between France and Iran for the release of
three Frenchmen held hostage in Lebanon.
   They are French diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine and
journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann. The three were kidnapped in 1985 by
the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
   A fourth Frenchman, Michel Seurat, a scientific researcher, was
kidnapped May 22, 1985. The Islamic Jihad claimed it killed him
March 5, 1986.
   Although no body has been found, Seurat's wife, Marie, said in a
book she published last month that French officials have confirmed
to her that her husband died in captivity.
   The magazine said Paris and Tehran had agreed on the release of
two French hostages in Lebanon in return for ``the release of
Iranian assets frozen in France in addition to a $1 billion
compensation to Iran.''
   It is believed the magazine referred to full repayment of a $1
billion loan made by the late Shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi,
to France and disputed interest that could amount to an additional
$1 billion.
   ``Last minute snags delayed the release,'' the magazine said.
   It indicated that France's insistance on the release of a third
French hostage held up implementation of the deal.
   The April 5 hijack of a Kuwait Airways jetliner by another group
of Shiite extremists also apparently delayed negotiations.
   Ash-Shiraa gained international fame in 1986 when it broke the
story of secret U.S. Arms sales to Iran in an atempt to free U.S.
hostages.
   In addition to the French captives, 18 other foreigners are
missing in Beirut. They are nine Americans, three Britons, a West
German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified
foreign men.

<HEAD>USDA Task Force Keeping Tabs on Drought Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parts of the country are so dry that the
Agriculture Department has had a special drought task force
watching developments for the last seven weeks, officials disclosed
Friday.
   The panel, appointed by Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng on
March 1 and headed by Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers, has been
meeting weekly. Members include heads of USDA agencies mostly
closely associated with farm programs, credit and other resources
that might be needed.
   Lyng said in a statement that USDA is stepping up contact with
state agriculture departments in the affected areas so those can
``provide us with a constant flow of information regarding the
moisture situation and preparations'' for relief.
   The Pacific Northwest and other Western states, which suffered
through drought last year, appear to be the prime regions for
another drought spell in 1988, with several states reporting
February and March being the driest on record, he said.
   Conditions likely to cause problems for agricultural producers
were said to prevail in parts of California, Nevada, Oregon,
Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, Utah and North Dakota.
   Some other states are having extremely dry weather in smaller
areas, raising concerns that forest fires could be severe this year.
   Lyng said several of the USDA agency administrators report that
their state and county offices in the dry areas have been received
numerous inquiries about various federal drought assistance
programs.

   Communist border guards fired a warning shot
Friday to block an escape attempt at the Berlin Wall, but a forest
ranger and a farm worker successfully fled to West Germany in
separate incidents, officials said.
   It was the second time this week that East German guards fired
shots during an escape attempt at the Berlin Wall, which splits the
city into its communist and Western halves.
   West Berlin police said witnesses reported a man running toward
West Berlin territory shortly after 1:00 a.m. with several East
German guards in pursuit.
   The man stopped with his hands over his head after East German
guards fired a single shot and was led away by the armed soldiers,
police quoted the witnesses as saying.
   Meanwhile, a 23-year-old East German man avoided communist
border guards, climbed over steel-mesh fences and strings of barbed
wire to escape to the West German state of Lower Saxony, about 100
miles west of Berlin.
   Border police in Hanover identified the man as an East German
forest ranger.
   Near the Bavarian town of Coburg, police said a 22-year-old East
German man who was working near the border escaped across the
barriers to West Germany before border guards noticed his flight,
police said.
   Police said the man was an agricultural worker, but they did not
say what duties he was performing near the border.
   Police, who spoke on condition of anonymity in each case, did
not release names according to official policy.
   At least 26 East Germans have escaped over borders into West
Germany this year.
   A 31-year-old East German escaped safely over the Berlin Wall
with a homemade ladder on Tuesday, dodging three salvos of bullets
from East German guards.

<HEAD>Bush Aides Say Meese a Political Problem for the Vice President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aides to George Bush said Friday the legal
difficulties surrounding Attorney General Edwin Meese III have
become a political liability for Bush and have put the vice
president in an awkward position.
   The Meese affair and what Bush himself refers to as ``this
so-called sleaze factor,'' have haunted the vice president on the
campaign trail. Hardly a stop goes by without at least one shouted
question to him on whether Meese should resign.
   The Democrats have seized the issue as ammunition against Bush,
who makes much of his role in the current administration. And the
vice president and his advisers say they expect Democrats to make
even more use of the issue as the general election nears.
   The Bush camp handles the issue two ways. In public, Bush takes
the part of the loyal vice president, saying he does not wish to
prejudge Meese, a longtime associate of President Reagan's, or to
interfere with the legal process.
   Privately, however, his aides suggest that it would be better
for the campaign if Meese would go.
   Bush aides, speaking on condition their names not be used, say
the vice president would be relieved if Meese would resign. But
Bush, as one who has been steadfastly loyal to Reagan, has found it
difficult to speak out on the issue, they say.
   The vice president was present at Wednesday's meeting at the
White House at which Reagan met with two departing Justice
Department officials, who reportedly told the president that Meese
was hurting the Justice Department.
   According to an administration source, former Justice Department
criminal division chief William Weld outlined a hypothetical
indictment he said he would have brought against Meese if he had
been the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general.
   Bush, who was in the Florida keys on Friday for a weekend
fishing trip with friends, has not commented on the session.
   A White House official, who also insisted upon anonymity, said
that from Bush's point of view nothing has changed as a result of
the session.
   Another official said the meeting had been arranged by the White
House and not because of Bush's sensitivities to the problem. It
was first talked about when Reagan was in California earlier this
month, the official said.
   While making a point of not criticizing Meese publicly, Bush
often comes close, telling audiences and interviewers that the
Justice Department should be ``above reproach.''
   Bush is proposing a new code of ethics ``that will help us avoid
the excesses of the past,'' and he speaks of plans to establish a
high-level ethics office in the White House.
   ``People should come to Washington to serve, not to profit,'' he
told a Republican gathering in Lancaster, Pa., earlier this week.
``When a congressman goes bad, or a member of the executive branch
betrays the public trust, you know and I know that it hurts.''
   Since last May 11, Meese has been the subject of a criminal
investigation by a special prosecutor examining various issues,
including Meese's assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   Looking ahead to the general election, Bush said recently that
Democrats ``are like a bunch of fish jumping out at a dry fly,
going wild about it. They're going to be going after me _ and I've
already heard it _ on this so-called `sleaze factor.'''
   When asked if Meese should resign, Bush usually says that he
doesn't want to prejudge the attorney general. And he goes on to
stress the high ethical standards he says he has heeded throughout
his political life.

<DATELINE>ORANGEBURG, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some faculty members and students at
predominantly black South Carolina State College are opposed to a
decision to award an honorary degree to Sen. Strom Thurmond, citing
his civil rights record.
   ``It's not just his old past, it's his recent past. Every single
civil rights bill since 1957, he has opposed. Right up to two weeks
ago, when he voted against the recent civil rights bill,'' said
history Professor William Hine.
   The board of trustees decided in February to give the honorary
doctorate of laws degree to Thurmond during graduation May 8,
school President Albert Smith said.
   Four petitions are circulating among the faculty calling for the
degree not to be awarded to the South Carolina Republican, Hine
said, and students are talking about boycotting graduation
ceremonies.
   Thurmond will accept the award but will be out of the country
May 8 on a classified trip with the Senate Armed Services
Committee, press secretary Chris Simpson said.
   Hine said most of the 25 faculty members he has talked with have
agreed to sign the petitions.
   Smith said the petition drive won't stop the degree from being
awarded.
   ``Certainly we need his support,'' Smith said.
   Simpson said Thurmond has endowed a scholarship at the school
and has helped bring $850,000 in federal grants to the school
within the past year.
   He also noted that Thurmond has been awarded honorary degrees at
four other predominantly black schools: Claflin College, Allen
University, Morris College and Vorhees College.
   ``If he had anything less then an exceptional record on aiding
minorities, or if there was anything to these allegations, I feel
certain that the other four historically black colleges would have
reached the same conclusion,'' he said.

   A 21-year-old servicewoman killed in a
terrorist bombing in Italy was eulogized Friday at the church where
she once sang in the choir, her pastor reminding mourners of their
wish for ``one more touch that cannot be.''
   Florida's governor, U.S. Navy officers, relatives and friends
joined to remember Angela Santos, the Navy radio operator third
class killed April 14 near a USO club in Naples.
   Four Italians also died in the bombing, which has been linked to
a member of the Japan's Red Army terrorist group.
   Some 350 mourners packed the Presbyterian Church of Marion Oaks,
where Ms. Santos had been in the choir. Her brother and others
sobbed as a tape was played of her playing the guitar and singing a
song she composed after her maternal grandmother's death.
   ``I want to thank you for the love and kindness that you gave
us,'' Ms. Santos sang on the tape as her remains lay in a
flag-draped casket flanked by red, white and blue floral sprays.
   ``It's hard to imagine that something that happened halfway
around the world brought us here today,'' the Rev. David Omerod,
said in a eulogy. ``Trying to imagine Angela as dead takes all the
strength we have. ... It's out of the natural order of things that
we bury our children.
   ``The shock, frustration, anger ... this is the reality of much
of life.
   ``She died at the hands of unforgiving men,'' Omerod said. ``We
grieve her loss, wishing one more smile, one more hug, one more
touch that cannot be.'' Gov. Bob Martinez attended with his wife,
Mary Jane, and spoke with Ms. Santos' family after seven Navy
pallbearers carried the casket out.
   ``I indicated to the father that as a father, I can feel his
loss,'' Martinez said. ``A terrorist is basically a killer.''
   Later, at Ocala's Belleview Cemetery, a Navy honor guard fired a
salute and a buglar played taps. The Navy gave Ms. Santos' family a
Purple Heart, the Navy Achievement Medal for meritorious service,
the Good Conduct Medal and the flag.
   At the church in Marion Oaks, the suburb of 4,500 where Ms.
Santos lived while attending high school, the choir sang what
members recalled was her favorite song: ``I Will Not Be Afraid.''
   Family members had recalled that she had enlisted in the Navy
right out of high school in 1984 instead of accepting college
scholarships because she wanted to travel and overcome her shyness.
   Her brother Jimmy, 18, said Ms. Santos had planned to attend his
high school graduation next month.
   ``You never expect it's going to be you,'' he said. ``I'm angry
that it happened to her, but I'm not angry with the military _
they're doing a job.'' Ms. Santos was scheduled for discharge this
August, but was undecided about whether to re-enlist again or to
start college, her family said. She had re-enlisted for one more
year last year.
   Her mother, Ellagene Cruz, described her daughter as a shy girl
who ``wanted to see the world and try her wings.''

<HEAD>Judge Waxes Poetic in Ruling That Cools Terlingua Chili War</HEAD>

   A federal judge has put the bite on the beef
between dueling Terlingua chili cookoffs, saying the law offered no
recipe for settling this long-simmering range war.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton of Pecod said he had no
authority to determine which party would have the official world's
chili cookoff.
   ``The parties should see this as an issue of good sense and
decency and not look to the courts,'' he said Thursday.
   However, he settled one lesser issue in the suit filed by the
faction headed by Ray King of Poteet, ruling that the rival group
founded by the late Frank X. Tolbert had no right to call itself
the Chili Appreciation Society International Inc.
   ``Jalapeno Sam'' Lewis, a San Angelo armadillo-race promoter,
jalapeno lollipop seller and long-time supporter of the Tolbert
group, said there will be no change in the cookoff format.
   ``We'll still have two chili cookoffs in Terlingua the first
Saturday in November. We'll identify one as the Tolbert cookoff and
one as the King cookoff,'' Lewis said Friday.
   The Terlingua cookoffs draw some 200 chili chefs to the
mercury-mining ghost town 300 miles southeast of El Paso, but they
are not the biggest in the world. ``The Texas Chili Championship in
San Marcos draws 300 or 400,'' Lewis said.
   The Terlingua cookoff, Lewis emphasized, ``is the big cookoff:
You cook through the year (at other competitions) and receive
points to get to Terlingua.''
   Tolbert _ the author of ``A Bowl of Red,'' the bible of chili _
began the cookoff in 1967. By the early 1980s, he was complaining
that the cookoff had become too stuffy and structured, so he bolted
and formed the opposition group.
   ``We're more laid back,'' Lewis said. ``We don't have a lot of
rules or regulation. They (King group) say you have to have chili a
certain color (red), a certain type (no beans). That creates clone
cooking.''
   Jo Ann Horton of Houston, editor of the Goat Gap Gazette, the
``clarion of the chili world,'' agreed with Lewis.
   ``One guy puts Cracker Jacks in his and wins, they all put
Cracker Jacks in theirs,'' but she said most winners stick to the
KISS recipe: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
   The two CASI groups had their own recipe for rivalry: Beginning
in 1983, both sides flew the CASI Inc. banner at competing events
on the same day. Both filed in 1983 for rights to the same name.
Both ended up in Bunton's court.
   Bunton said King had registered the CASI Inc. name as a federal
trademark, so the Tolbert group had no right to use it. He found
that prior use of the trademark by Tolbert did not constitute
infringement, but that future use by anyone other than the King
group would.
   He ordered CASI Inc. to pay the Tolbert heirs $1,500 for the
cost of the federal trademark, but said the defendants must pay
court costs. No attorneys fees were awarded.
   Bunton's ruling also waxed poetic on one issue the rivals hadn't
raised: hot chili.
   ``Some like it hot, some like it cold. Some like it in the pot
nine days old. When it comes, however, to good, stout chili, if you
don't like it hot, you're just plum silly,'' his ruling said.

   Sikh extremists shot to death eight Hindu
laborers who were were sleeping near their brick kiln in northern
Punjab state on Friday, a security official said.
   S.S. Virk, deputy inspector general of the paramilitary Central
Reserve Police Force, said the gunmen opened fire with AK-47
rifles, killing the laborers instantly.
   The attack occurred in the village of Jastarwal, 25 miles south
of Amritsar.
   Also Friday, the United News of India reported that six people,
at least four of them Hindus, were shot to death in an ambush by
Sikh militants in Jalandhar, 50 miles southeast of Amritsar.
   Four other deaths were reported in the state late Thursday and
early Friday, the news agency said.
   The latest killings raised to nearly 790 the number of deaths
blamed on Sikh extremists in Punjab since the start of the year.
   The Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982
for more political autonomy or an independent homeland in Punjab.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are face
discrimination from India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less
than 2 percent of India's 800 million population but are a majority
in Punjab.

   Five people were killed, 15 wounded and 42 held hostage and
later freed in the assault that ended Thursday at the branch of the
National Bank of Mexico in this Gulf of California agricultural
town.
   Unconfirmed reports said the seven robbers took about $13,000
from the bank, but neither police nor bank officials would confirm
the amount.
   Police on Friday combed a working-class neighborhood where the
young men abandoned a pickup truck and station wagon.
   Judicial police chief Arturo Moreno said Friday the search so
far has yielded no results.
   Army soldiers kept watch at the borders of this northwestern
state.
   ``We did not promise pardons. We said the pursuit would begin
immediately,'' Sinaloa Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa said late
Thursday.
   Labastida Ochoa, who directed negotiations for the release of
the hostages, criticized ``irresponsible people who called for
turning a tragedy into a political act.''
   ``They mobilized people and called on the population to free the
hostages, (and) the criminals and to take to the street in
irresponsible acts that could provoke a great tragedy,'' he said.
   Mentioning the possibility that ``political agitators'' may have
been involved, he added: ``I hope they have not acted with the
support or authorization of any political party opposing the
government.''
   Sinaloa is one of the northwestern states where the conservative
National Action Party is strong and is the home state of Manuel
Clouthier, the party's candidate in July 6 presidential elections.
   On Thursday, a crowd of least 1,000 shouting, ``Freedom,
freedom,'' surged toward the bank and an armored car as police
withdrew to allow the gunmen to escape.
   The authorities had agreed to provide the gunmen with an armored
car and let them take three Red Cross workers hostage.
   Some of the crowd crawled atop the vehicle and stayed with it
for several blocks as it sped from the crime scene.
   Police sharpshooters on rooftops around the bank were unable to
act because of the crowd.
   Labastida said the final police report listed four deaths _ two
bank employees, a Red Cross worker and a policeman. However, police
said Thursday that five people, including two policemen, were
killed.
   Police said the gunmen released the Red Cross hostages,
abandoned the armored car and stole a pickup and station wagon
about 15 minutes after they fled.
   Hostage Rosario Angulo, who drove the armored car, said five
gunmen, one of whom had an arm wound, fled in the truck and two
others apparently mixed in with the crowd.
   He said they had ``sawed-off machine guns, ammunition and
dynamite sticks,'' the latter tied to their bodies.
   The gunmen took the hostages after police responded to an alarm
about a robbery attempt. The deaths and injuries occurred in the
ensuing shootout.
   Hundreds of police surrounded the bank in this city of 120,000
during the siege.
   A local Red Cross worker said Attorney General's Office
officials took his three colleagues who were used as hostages
during the escape ``to an undisclosed location,'' apparently to
interrogate them.
   Bank robberies and other crimes have increased in Mexico since
the onset in 1982 of an economic crisis that has driven up prices
and unemployment.
   Sinaloa is known as a crime center, particularly for the illegal
narcotics trade.
   The Attorney General's Office and the army have an ongoing
campaign against production and trafficking of narcotics in the
region.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Angry Over Food Shipments to Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Nicaragua accused the United States on Friday
of violating a month-old cease-fire agreement with rebel forces by
sending food shipments to Contra camps in Honduras.
   Nicaragua's U.S. ambassador, Carlos Tunnermann, was called back
to Managua for ``urgent consultations'' on the issue, embassy
political counselor Martin Vega said.
   Congress approved a $47.9 million humanitarian aid package for
the rebels three weeks ago, and 69,000 pounds of rice, beans and
other food items were sent to Contra camps in Honduras near the
Nicaraguan border this week.
   Nicaragua contends that the temporary truce signed on March 23
permits deliveries of humanitarian aid only to Contras assembled in
mutually agreed cease-fire zones inside Nicaragua.
   Vega called the U.S. deliveries a violation of the agreement. He
said Tunnermann plans to return to Washington on Tuesday.
   The leftist Sandinista government and the rebels have designated
seven cease-fire zones where the Contras are to assemble but have
not yet reached agreement on ground rules governing there presence
in these areas.
   Thus, the Contras have not yet resettled in the zones even
though an April 15 deadline had been set for their resettlement.
   Alfredo Cesar, a member of the directorate of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the rebels' formal name, told reporters Friday that
large numbers of Contras have fled across the border to Honduras in
recent weeks because of food shortages in Nicaragua.
   He denied that the shipments to Contra camps represented a
violation of the truce agreement.
   The Sandinista government maintains that the agreement specifies
that the aid is to be delivered to rebels in the cease-fire zones
by ``neutral organizations'' and that a verification commission
must ensure compliance.
   The Secretary General of the Organization of American States,
Joao Baena Soares, is one of two commission members. He was due to
interrupt a trip to Latin America on Friday night and to return to
OAS headquarters in Washington to review the controversy over the
U.S. food shipments, an OAS spokesman said.
   An Agency for International Development official, speaking only
on condition of anonymity, said Thursday the shipments were sent
from the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa after being inspected by
independent observers, including Honduran clergymen.
   These were the first deliveries of U.S. aid to the rebels since
Congress cut off all assistance to the rebels on Feb. 29. The $47.9
million package, which includes food, clothing, shelter and medical
supplies, was approved by Congress a week after the March 23 truce
was signed.
   Cesar told reporters the number of rebels on the Honduran side
of the border has swelled in recent weeks to 3,000 to 4,000 because
of the food shortages in Nicaragua. It was not clear, however, how
many rebels were in that area prior to the recent exodus from
Nicaragua.
   At the time of the truce agreement, there were an estimated
12,000 Contra fighters in Nicaragua.
   Rebel forces in jungle and mountainous regions in Nicaragua face
``a very difficult situation,'' Cesar said. He added that the
troops will be ordered to return to Nicaragua once U.S.-sponsored
food shipments inside Nicaragua begin.
   Sandinista and rebel negotiators will resume their discussions
on April 28 in Managua. Cesar said he believes the differences
between the two sides over ground rules in the cease-fire zones can
be ironed out quickly.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis on Friday
accused Vice President George Bush of failing to understand ``what
it takes to build an economic future and to create good jobs.''
   Dukakis, attacking on what could be a major general election
issue, said, ``I don't see how we are going to bring good jobs and
good wages back to the industrial Midwest unless we work together.
If the vice president doesn't understand that, then he shouldn't be
running for president.''
   The Democratic front-runner also criticized Bush, the
all-but-sure Republican nominee, for saying he wants to be ``the
education president.''
   ``How can he say that after the last seven years?'' Dukakis
asked a crowd of students at Mercyhurst College. ``After seven
years of an administration that has slammed a door in the face of
millions of youngsters looking for a chance to go to college? After
seven years of treating education ... as if it were a privilege for
the few, instead of a right and a necessity for every American?''
   As for his own proposals, Dukakis called for a national teaching
excellence fund and an education security fund to boost teachers
and to make more college loans available to students. He said his
ideas would cost an additional $250 million in federal spending.
   The Massachusetts governor had nothing but praise for his
remaining Democratic rival, saying he and Jesse Jackson have to
work together in the ``spirit of friendship'' for victory in the
general election.
   Friday night, he faced Jackson in the first one-on-one debate
with the newly reduced field.
   Asked if Jackson is less likely to be his running mate after a
poll said such a move would cost the Democrats votes in the fall,
Dukakis said, ``No, I never pay any attention to polls.''
   Dukakis had a full campaign day across Ohio and Pennsylvania,
seeking blue-collar votes in the nation's industrial heartland. The
Pennsylvania primary is next Tuesday, with Ohio and Indiana voting
the next week.
   ``You're looking at someone who is a true-blue,
dyed-in-the-wool, full-employment Democrat,'' he told workers
outside a Ford plant in Maumee, Ohio.
   At the Ford plant near Toledo and a steel plant in Pittsburgh,
Dukakis emphasized his support for government working in
partnership with business and labor to save jobs.
   Asked by a reporter about a Bush statement that government
should stay out of the private sector, Dukakis replied at a Toledo
airport news conference:
   ``I don't think the vice president understands what it takes to
build an economic future and to create good jobs. There are
governors and mayors, businessmen and women, labor leaders ...
working together across this country.''
   ``Government shouldn't do it all. I'm a strong believer in the
free enterprise system, but we need a president who will be a
strong partner for you here in Ohio ... who will help with some
resources, some support,'' he said. ``It's the public-private
partnerships that are making the difference all over the country.
That's what I've been doing'' in Massachusetts.
   Dukakis also criticized President Reagan for threatening to veto
the congressional trade bill because of its plant-closing
provisions. He took Reagan to task for repeating his veto pledge
Thursday in Springfield, Mass.
   ``The irony is that he chose to deliver that speech in the one
state that has a comprehensive plant-closing law that works and
works well,'' he told about 100 workers standing in a cold wind
outside the Ford plant.
   Later Dukakis strengthened his criticism of Reagan.
   ``It would be a tragedy if the trade bill that has been worked
on hard and that now is a responsible piece of legislation would be
vetoed because of something we should have done a long time ago,''
he told reporters in Erie. ``A very modest, very mild 60-day notice
provision seems to me to be just simple justice for workers and
working families.''

<HEAD>Charleston Prepares For Grenada II</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With lessons learned from the Grenada
evacuation, Charleston County officials are preparing for the
possibility of a hasty civilian evacuation from Central America.
   ``I guess that the national network interviews of Americans in
Panama made me think in terms of that. Basically, it's just
headlines until you start seeing people and their concerns about
things like that,'' William J. Knowles, director of Charleston
County's Department of Social Services, said Friday.
   During the past three weeks, social services employees have been
assembling ``survival boxes'' containing items ranging from
registration forms to diapers.
   They also have a stockpile of quarters for any new arrival who
might need to make a telephone call.
   The repatriation would be similar to the last-minute handling of
the more than 500 evacuees flown to the Charleston Air Force Base
after the 1983 invasion of Grenada, said Knowles.
   Though the Charleston Air Force Base has not been designated a
civilian evacuation landing zone, Knowles said it is the most
logical and convenient for the large aircraft known to supply
American bases in Central America.
   ``We were very lucky with Grenada because this line of
government dealt with that line of government right up to the State
Department. But with something like an evacuation, you never know
what may happen,'' he said.
   ``It's just been a prudent ground effort to muster the resources
of an agency at a minute's notice,'' he said. ``We don't want to be
in a position of having to run around looking for this and that.''

   Three federal research facilities were
designated Friday as special centers to help industry develop
commercial uses for superconducting technology.
   The Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Tennessee will collaborate with private industry in an attempt to
apply the technology gleaned from basic energy research, Energy
Secretary John S. Herrington said.
   He said their designation is in keeping with an initiative
President Reagan outlined last year in which government and
industry will work together to find commercial applications for
high-temperature superconductors, which can conduct electricity
without energy loss.
   ``Superconductors ... have great potential in such areas as
electrical generation, storage and transmission, computers,
communications, medical diagnostics and transportation,'' the
Energy Department said. ``However, the newly discovered materials
will require extensive research and development.''
   All three laboratories have been active in superconductivity
research and have the facilities and expertise needed to make the
technology marketable, Herrington said.

   A fire science specialist will examine the
wreckage of a commuter plane that crash-landed at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport with one of its two engines on fire, federal
investigators said Friday.
   Merrit Berke, a government fire science expert, will look at
burn patterns on the de Havilland Dash 8 ``and try to help us
determine where the fire originated,'' said Bob Benzon of the
National Transportation Safety Board.
   Meanwhile, the pilot of the Horizon Air plane issued a statement
praising his crew and ground personnel in handling the April 15
crash, in which 19 of the 40 people on board were injured. Three
remain hospitalized.
   ``We did our jobs. ... Under the circumstances, the crew of
Flight 2658 performed and handled the emergency the way we were
trained,'' pilot Carl Carlson, who has declined public comment
since the crash, said Thursday.
   ``Beyond those of us on the aircraft, the emergency crews on the
ground performed flawlessly,'' he said.
   The plane's right engine burst into flames shortly after
takeoff, and Carlson later told investigators he had trouble
controlling the craft when he returned to the airport.
   When the plane touched down, the last words from Carlson heard
by the airport control tower were ``I'm out of control,'' said
Steve Boniberger, an air traffic controller.
   He said Thursday that Carlson sounded calm, but became more
excited while the plane touched down and hurtled down the runway.
Controllers could see flames and smoke from the engine while the
plane descended, Boniberger said.
   He said the plane did not appear to be out of control in the
air, and that the pilot didn't mention the difficulty until landing.
   Benzon, the NTSB's chief investigator on the crash, said that
despite the fire, the plane could have been expected to remain on
the runway during the landing. Instead, it veered off the runway,
went across a strip of grass, and crashed into passenger gates at
the main terminal. No one on the ground was injured.
   Investigators hope Berke can help determine the source of the
fuel leak involved in the fire and the source of ignition, Benzon
said. Investigators believe the fuel may have spilled from a loose
fuel pump, he said.
   The plane's two engines were sent to the Pratt & Whitney Canada
factory in Montreal and other parts were sent to their
manufacturers as part of the investigation.

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz can keep any
money he makes from selling his story, the chairman of the state
Crime Victims Board said Friday.
   The four-member board decided unanimously that the state ``Son
of Sam'' law does not apply to Goetz, said Chairman Angelo
Petromelis. The board made the ruling March 17 in response to a
petition filed by Goetz, he said.
   The board said the crime profits law didn't apply because the
jury that tried Goetz determined that the four teen-agers he shot
were not crime victims. Goetz was acquitted of assault, attempted
murder, reckless endangerment and all but one weapons charge.
   Under the ``Son of Sam'' law, any profits made by convicts who
sell the stories of their crimes are held in escrow by the board
for the person's victims.
   The law was created in 1979 to prevent ``Son of Sam'' killer
David Berkowitz from profiting from book and movie deals about his
year-long crime rampage, which left six people dead and seven
wounded. A judge last year ordered that more than $118,000
Berkowitz received for the rights to his story should be turned
over to families of his victims.
   According to Crime Victims Board attorney Judith Brindle, Goetz
has yet to sell the story of the subway shooting.
   Goetz was convicted in June 1987 of one count of third-degree
weapons possession in the shooting of four 19-year-olds on a subway
Dec. 22, 1984. Goetz maintained that the teen-agers were trying to
rob him when they approached and asked for $5. The youths said they
were panhandling.
   Neither Goetz nor his lawyer were immediately available for
comment. There was no answer at Goetz's home phone. Lawyer Barry
Slotnick didn't return calls.
   Goetz was sentenced to six months in jail and 4{ years probation
but is free on $5,000 bail pending appeal.
   The ruled March 17, but the ruling was mailed to involved
parties this week and released publicly Friday, said Lorraine
Felegy, counsel to the board.

   Explosions and gunfire were heard at
the government's main air force base on Friday, but officials would
not say what had occurred.
   The sounds of gunshots, helicopters and explosions filled the
air starting at about 7:30 p.m. (10 a.m. EDT) at the base in
Katunayake, about 15 miles north of Colombo.
   Gen. Sepala Attygalle, secretary of the Defense Ministry, said
``there has been an explosion and some shooting at the Katunayake
air force base, but I don't have details.'' Air Marshall A.W.
Fernando also declined to explain what had occurred.
   Residents living nearby said there were reports that airmen were
attacking each other and that more than 20 were injured. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The base is at the northern edge of Colombo's international
airport.
   On June 8, the base was attacked by the Peoples Liberation
Front, a group of nationalist Sinhalese. Sentries repulsed the
attack and killed two intruders. Scores of arrests followed.
   The front was outlawed after an abortive 1971 effort to
overthrow the Sri Lankan government, but it began regrouping in
1986. Initially a radical Marxist group, it now champions the cause
of the island's majority Sinhalese.
   The front has opposed the peace accord signed last July by Sri
Lanka and India to try to end a five-year separatist rebellion by
Tamils in the north.
   The Sinhalese group contends the pact makes too many concessions
to the Tamil minority and has vowed to kill anyone who supports the
accord.
   Tamils, who comprise about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who
control the government and military. Tamils are mostly Hindus while
the Sinhalese are Buddhists.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday refused to grant a
mistrial in a smoking liability lawsuit, saying he was satisfied
that an opinion he issued that was critical of three tobacco
companies had not prejudiced the jury.
   Defense attorneys for the cigarette makers requested the
mistrial, arguing that the opinion issued Thursday by U.S. District
Judge H. Lee Sarokin had generated inflammatory headlines.
   In the opinion, Sarokin dismissed some of the claims against the
companies _ Liggett Group Inc., Philip Morris Inc. and Lorillard
Inc. _ but rejected the companies' request to dismiss the entire
lawsuit.
   The judge said the jury will decide whether the companies
covered up the dangers of smoking based on evidence that indicates
``a tobacco industry conspiracy, vast in its scope, devious in its
purpose and devastating in its results.''
   The suit, filed by Antonio Cipollone, 64, of Lakehurst, says the
cigarette makers bear responsibility for the death of Cipollone's
wife, Rose, who died at age 58 in 1984 after smoking for 40 years.
   ``I know that jurors say they haven't seen anything when they
have,'' Peter Bleakley, an attorney for Philip Morris, said in
arguing for a mistrial. ``I don't think anything can be done about
the prejudice that has already taken place.''
   Bleakley pointed to a headline in an area newspaper that said
``Judge Finds Conspiracy.''
   Sarokin questioned each juror individually in his chambers, and
emerged 45 minutes later and had the court clerk reread the
questions he asked as well as each response of the jury.
   In the remarks, the judge told each juror that in the past two
days, there had been a great deal of publicity about the case and
that he wanted to learn if they knew of it.
   One man said all he ever reads is the comic strips and that the
evening news is all ``malarkey,'' the court clerk read.
   Five jurors said they had heard some outside comment on the case
but had followed the judge's instructions not to discuss it.
   ``I am entirely satisfied that the answers of the jury are
entirely credible,'' Sarokin told attorneys before recalling the
jury. ``There is no evidence whatsoever that the jurors were
prejudiced. It insults them to suggest that they would now lie to
the court.''
   Bleakley said that was never his contention.
   ``I did not accuse any juror of lying,'' Bleakley said. ``But
there were highly inflammatory headlines and there should be a
presumption that publicity was received.''
   In rejecting the defense's request Thursday to dismiss the
entire lawsuit, Sarokin wrote, ``If the jury accepts the
plaintiff's version of the facts as to the conduct of the
defendants, it is difficult to envision a more compelling case for
an award of punitive damages.''
   Sarokin did dismiss claims that the three companies caused Mrs.
Cipollone's cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette and by
failing to conduct adequate research into the health effects of
smoking.
   Cipollone's attorneys say the trial, which began Feb. 1, breaks
new ground because for the first time a plaintiff's lawyers had
access to confidential files of tobacco companies and trade groups
detailing their public relations strategies.
   Defense attorneys contend Mrs. Cippolone smoked of her own free
will and was an intelligent, independent woman who knew the dangers
smoking poses.

<HEAD>Officials, Journalists Recommend Easing Of Travel Restrictions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and Soviet officials and journalists
on Friday closed an unusual conference on information policy with a
recommendation that both governments ease travel restrictions on
each other's journalists.
   The meeting resulted from a conversation at the Washington
summit last December involving Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
his politburo colleague Aleksandr Yakovlev, and Charles Z. Wick,
head of the U.S. Information Agency.
   One discussion panel made a recommendation to ``urge our
respective governments to take reciprocal steps to ease travel
restrictions on journalists,'' Wick told a news conference.
   Wick and the head of the Soviet delegation, Valentin Falin,
chairman of the semi-official Novosti news agency, stressed that
the panel's recommendation did not mean either government would
change its policies.
   ``In strict compliance with what has been said by the American
side, the Soviet side on its return (to Moscow) will report to the
competent Soviet agencies all the wishes that have been expressed
and all the proposals and considerations that have been expressed
during the meetings,'' said Falin.
   The number and movements of U.S. and Soviet journalists in the
respective countries are tightly controlled by the governments.
U.S. journalists living in Moscow, and Soviet journalists living in
Washington and New York, cannot travel more than 21 miles outside
those cities without prior approval from the host government.
   The Helsinki accords of 1975 eased some of restrictions on the
work and movements of U.S. and Soviet journalists in each other's
countries, but many remain.
   For example, some cities and regions in each country are closed
to reporters and journalists from the other.
   Wick, reading from a statement approved by one discussion panel,
said: ``The group clearly felt that closed cities should be
gradually opened and other restrictions on coverage should be
lifted. Previous historical arguments about their origin should be
abandoned.''
   Soviet officials have said in the past that they imposed the
restrictions in response to American actions.
   U.S. officials, however, say that the Soviets imposed the travel
restrictions after Nazi Germany invaded in 1941, and left them in
place after the war. The U.S. government imposed similar
restrictions on the movement of Soviet journalists in the United
States in the 1950s.
   Wick said the conference panel discussing the print media
``mutually agreed to undertake, under the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, the American Society of Magazine Editors, and
equivalent Soviet entities, a survey of print media coverage to be
performed by competent academic institutions selected by each side
and reviewed by professional journalists.''
   ``The aim here is to address the innaccurate media stereotypes
each society has of each other,'' said Wick.
   ``There is recognition among panel members that access and
coverage possibilities for journalists be maintained in the bad
times as well as the good times. Perhaps even more so,'' the
statement said. ``It was agreed that in times of tension accurate
reporting provided by such access was all the more desirable.''

   Frank Bourgin has been a civil servant, a
manufacturer and clothier in the 46 years since his doctoral
dissertation was rejected by the University of Chicago. Now he's
finally going to get his Ph.D and recognition for trailblazing
scholarship.
   ``There wasn't a time I didn't feel completely frustrated,''
said Bourgin, now 77 and retired in Chevy Chase, Md. ``I would meet
a Ph.D and think, that's what I should be.''
   ``I would go to one of my stores in the morning and think, `What
am I doing here, opening a store?''' he added in a recent interview
with The New York Times. ``I spent 40 years doing things I really
didn't want to do.''
   Bourgin was a graduate student when he submitted his
dissertation to the political science faculty at Chicago in 1942.
   He argued that the nation's early leaders, among them Alexander
Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, had intended to use the federal
government's powers to develop the fledgling nation's resources
through public works and other projects.
   Bourgin's dissertation was rejected. It may have sounded like
heresy at the time.
   The paper challenged the then-common conviction that the New
Deal social programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt marked a
departure from laissez faire principles attributed to the founding
fathers.
   Bourgin's idea has since gained wide acceptance through the work
of other historians, notably Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in his recent
book, ``Cycles of American History.''
   Bourgin decided after reading Schlesinger's book last year to
make a new effort to gain acceptance for his dissertation, now
titled, ``Affirmative Government in the Early American Economy.''
   He sent Schlesinger a summary of his work, setting in motion a
process that will culminate later this spring when Bourgin finally
receives his doctorate at commencement.
   ``We're just not handing out a degree,'' said Professor Joseph
Cropsey, the political science department's director of graduate
studies and a member of the three-man committee that reviewed the
dissertation last fall.
   ``He earned it.''
   ``I wasn't even born when he wrote this, so I simply treated it
as a revised draft,'' Gary Orfield, a political science professor
at Chicago and also a member of the review committee, said Friday.
   ``But it had been updated. There were many sources added that
came long after the first paper was submitted,'' Orfield added.
``It's a testament to his grit. He is the kind of guy everybody
should want to be at his age _ determined, committed, pressing
forward. I think he's a real inspiration.''
   A letter from Schlesinger, who calls Bourgin's dissertation ``a
strikingly original piece of work,'' and prodding by several other
scholars helped to bring about the review.
   Among Bourgin's supporters was C. Herman Pritchett of the
University of California, a retired chairman of the political
science department at Chicago who is listed as a member of the
original faculty review committee.
   Pritchett said he does not recall the original dissertation. But
after reading it recently at Bourgin's request, he urged a
reappraisal.
   ``I thought it was a tremendous job,'' Pritchett said in a
telephone interview with the Times. ``I simply couldn't understand
how it could have been rejected.''
   Though no one knows why the original dissertation was rejected,
it is believed the retirement of Bourgin's mentor and Ph.D adviser
played a role.
   When Bourgin learned of the rejection, he was married, had a
child and a job and couldn't return to campus as a full-time
student to revise his manuscript.
   Bourgin went on to manufacture light fixtures, owned a chain of
men's clothing stores in Minnesota and became a federal civil
servant, becoming regional director for the federal Office of
Emergency Planning, supervising a five-state region in the Midwest.
   Now Bourgin's philosophical about his study's long-awaited
vindication.
   ``It's really a crazy story,'' Bourgin said.

<HEAD>Labeling Mixup Reported on Iodine Bottles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One-ounce amber bottles of Brite Life brand
ipecac syrup and Brite Life Iodides Tincture, an iodine, are being
recalled nationwide because of a labeling error, the Food and Drug
Administration said Friday.
   Some bottles of the iodine were mislabeled as ipecac syrup,
which is used to produce vomiting after a suspected poisoning.
   Iodine, while potentially harmful if swallowed in large amounts,
would not likely to cause harm in such a small dose, the FDA said.
The problem stemming from the mislabeling is that iodine would not
induce the desired vomiting, said spokesman Bill Grigg.
   The recall affects Brite Life ipecac syrup Lot 004715 with
expiration date 7-92 and Brite Life Iodides Tincture Lot 004713
with expiration date 2-92.
   The FDA said the mislabeled bottles of iodine may also be
identified by the presence of a plastic applicator rod visible in
the bottle.
   The manufacturer, Humco Laboratory of Texarkana, Texas, found 18
mislabled iodine bottles inside its facilities and notified the FDA
and its distributors.
   About 12,000 bottles of the ipecac and 4,500 bottles of iodine
of the affected lots have been distributed since last September,
the FDA said.
   Any bottles covered by the recall should be returned to the
place of purchase, the agency said.

<HEAD>Graham Says There Is A Christian Revival In China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NANKING, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelist Billy Graham told listeners at
China's largest Protestant seminary Friday that he believes a
Christian revival is occurring in Communist-ruled China.
   He told about 250 students and faculty at the Nanking Union
Theological Seminary that Americans are going to church more and
becoming more religious.
   ``And among the Christians in China, I feel the same thing in
just the short time I've been here _ that people are turning to
Christ in great numbers,'' he said.
   Some people sat on wooden chairs in the aisles and others stood
in the doorways of the packed chapel to hear the Southern Baptist
minister.
   Graham said a high-level government official told him ``that the
church in China grows most when there's persecution.''
   The audience laughed when Graham said the official, whom he did
not identify, joked that ``maybe the best way to evangelize China
is to have much persecution.''
   Christianity has never had a strong following in China despite
centuries of missionary work by Western countries before the
communist takeover in 1949.
   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Christians were
persecuted. Churches were turned over to secular groups or
destroyed and many believers were tortured and jailed.
   In recent years, the government has allowed religious activities
to resume, but it administers all such activity through the Bureau
of Religious Affairs.
   An estimated 4 million Protestants worship in 4,000
state-sanctioned churches, but millions more are believed to meet
privately in their homes.
   An estimated 3 million Catholics belong to the
government-supervised Catholic Churches Patriotic Association,
which does not recognize the authority of the Roman Catholic pope.
Millions of other Catholics are believed to remain loyal to the
Vatican and worship in secret.
   The government has no relations with the Vatican, which
recognizes the rival Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan.
   Graham spoke for about an hour at the seminary, which has 170
students, lecturing on how to preach effectively.
   The 69-year-old evangelist, who has preached in 70 countries,
told his listeners to preach the Gospel with authority, simplicity,
repetition and urgency.
   During a question-and-answer period, a student asked how to
preach Christianity in an officially athiestic country such as
China.
   ``In the same way,'' Graham replied.
   ``I'm not sure there are genuine athiests,'' he added.
   The Nanking Seminary is the only one in China that accepts
students from all over the country. Ten smaller Protestant
seminaries accept only students from their areas and have a total
of enrollment of about 600.
   Graham, accompanied by his wife, Ruth, and son, Franklin,
traveled to Shanghai later Friday.
   Graham is making his first visit to China. He arrived April 12
and spent a week in Beijing where he met with Premier Li Peng.
   The Grahams also visited Huaiyin in eastern Jiangsu province
where Mrs. Graham, the daughter of a mission doctor, spent the
first 17 years of her life.
   Graham is scheduled to visit Canton before leaving China on
April 28.

<DATELINE>WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson sought on Friday to
bolster his support in the Philadelphia area, where he already has
the support of the mayor and a major newspaper for Tuesday's state
Democratic primary.
   Friday night, he and Dukakis were to debate at the University of
Pennsylvania in their first meeting since Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore suspended his bid for the Democratic nomination after a
disappointing third-place finish in New York.
   At West Chester State University, Jackson was greeted at a rally
by about 1,000 students, including about 200 waving blue and white
placards for Republican George Bush. The placards were distributed
before the rally by a campus Republican group.
   At the close of Jackson's remarks, a dozen of the Bush
supporters began chanting the vice president's name as Jackson led
the crowd in a cheer of his own: ``Stop drugs. Save jobs.''
   Jackson talked of his competition with Democratic front-runner
Michael Dukakis in his remarks, contending they were virtually even.
   ``The field once was crowded, but now there are three, three
survivors ... Bush, Dukakis and me, and here we are and here we
go,'' Jackson said. ``We're running neck and neck. I'm a
long-distance runner and I don't lose stride.''
   His aides noted that he is close behind Dukakis in total votes
in primaries to date, although Dukakis has a substantial lead in
delegates to the national convention.
   On Saturday, the two remaining Democrats planned to meet in
another debate in Pittsburgh, where Jackson's support is uncertain.
   Jackson met with editorial boards of the Philadelphia Daily News
and the Inquirer Friday morning, then canceled an early afternoon
appearance in Philadelphia before heading for West Chester.
   He renewed his criticism of President Reagan's Central American
policies, telling the students, ``Your generation must go beyond
war in Latin America. We're not threatened by three million
Sandinistas. And, if so, we can't be saved by 15,000 Contras.''
   Alluding to the administration oft-quoted contention that
Nicaragua is the ``back door'' to the United States, Jackson said
the nation is actually ``next door'' and a possible ally.
   Jackson also questioned the administration's commitment to
student aid.
   ``If you were about to lose your scholarship, who would you want
to argue your case?'' he asked. ``When I win, you win. When I win,
scholarships win.''

   Cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 9.37 million head as of April 1, up 6
percent from a year ago and 5 percent above two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Only Arizona and Illinois showed decreases from April 1, 1987,
while cattle numbers in Minnesota were virtually unchanged.
Increases were reported for California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa,
Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during January, February
and March totaled 5.81 million head, a 1 percent increase from the
same period of 1987 and also 1 percent more than in 1986, the
report said.
   The placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the first
quarter of the year totaled 5.8 million head, up 2 percent from
last year and 10 percent more than two years ago.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.93 million head
during April, May and June, up 6 percent from second-quarter levels
of last year and 2 percent more than two years ago.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of April
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>Botha Condemns Neo-Nazi Insults of Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha condemned
neo-Nazis who placed pigs' heads at the front doors of a synagogue
and a Jewish club on the 99th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth.
   ``South Africa will have to rid itself of these people if we
want to get somewhere,'' Botha said Friday in Parliament. South
Africa has about 100,000 Jews in a total white population of 5
million.
   Josh Goldberg, director of the Council of Jewry in Natal
province, quoted witnesses as saying six white men wearing boots
and black Nazi-style uniforms with swastika-like arm bands drove up
to a synagogue in Durban late Wednesday and placed a pig's head at
the entrance. The head was covered with swastikas.
   Durban police said they were seeking the culpirts.
   A celebration of Israel's 40th anniversary was held at the
Jewish club Wednesday evening, Goldberg said, and a pig's head was
left there soon after it ended.
   ``I think it is only sick people who can take a pig's head and
place it in front of the holy shrine of others,'' Botha said,
promising an investigation.
   Government officials and legislators joined the condemnation.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok considered the incidents
sickening, a spokesman said. Colin Eglin, leader of the white
opposition Progressive Federal Party, said they were ``a deliberate
affront to members of the Jewish community.''
   Wynand Malan, an independent member of Parliament, urged police
to arrest those responsible for the Durban incidents and the
throwing of a smoke grenade into a mosque Wednesday night near
Johannesburg. He said South Africa's future is ``in the rich
diversity in our society.''
   A member of the Moslem congregation at Heidelberg, an industrial
community, said two worshipers were injured when a man in uniform
threw the grenade during an observance of the holy month of Ramadan.
   The independent South African Press Association said members of
the Afrikaner National Socialists celebrated Hitler's birthday
Wednesday in Pretoria, the capital.
   It quoted Koos Vermeulen, the group's leader, as saying:
``People tend to get upset when people who believed in Hitler's
greatness honor him. So we conduct our celebrations in secret.''
   Although South Africa joined the Allies during both world wars,
there was sympathy for the German and Nazi causes among the
Afrikaners who are South Africa's dominant white community.
   In 1939-41, Botha belonged to the pro-German Ossewabrandwag, a
paramilitary group. He resigned in 1941 and repudiated the
leadership.
   South Africa has 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national
affairs under the apartheid system.

   Rep. Richard Gephardt ended his presidential
campaign with $1.8 million in debts, a sum that his campaign
manager says has been whittled down by about $300,000 since he
dropped out.
   Gephardt's campaign financial report, filed this week with the
Federal Election Commission, showed he had $67,700 in the bank at
the end of March, and a debt of $1.8 million.
   The Missouri congressman abandoned his presidential bid on March
28, two days after he suffered defeat in Michigan, a state he had
counted on heavily to pull his campaign out of the doldrums.
   He raised $2 million in the last month of his campaign,
including $161,107 in federal matching funds, and $698,059 in loans.
   Of the bank loan debt, only $85,000 is left to be paid, said
Gephardt's campaign manager William Carrick.
   Carrick said Gephardt will hold fund-raising events to pay off
the debt.

   He characterized Dukakis as ``liberal, but he's not an all-out

<HEAD>Reagan Says Congress Caved in to Organized Labor With Trade Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>DESK: SUBS 8th graf pvs, bgng: Byrd said, with vote tentatively
scheduled for Tuesday.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday charged Congress
with caving in to organized labor with its trade bill but
supporters of the measure said it was his ``wishful thinking'' that
a veto would win him a version he prefers.
   The president has promised to veto the bill because of a
provision requiring all but the smallest employers to give 60 days
notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   As the Senate began debate on the sweeping trade measure Friday,
Reagan told a group of conservative state legislators that the
plant-closings provision ``would make American industry less
competitive.''
   ``Put simply, on key provisions in the trade bill, the
Democratic leadership in Congress has caved in to pressure from
organized labor,'' Reagan said. ``If this bill is unloaded on my
desk, I'll stamp it reject and ship it back to where it was made.''
   The House on Thursday passed the bill, with Democrats achieving
more than the two-thirds vote needed to override a Reagan veto.
   The White House continued lobbying senators on Friday to vote
with the president, arguing it would force Congress to send him a
bill without the plant-closing provision.
   ``That's wishful thinking,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., said as Senate debate began Friday. If enough
senators voted to sustain the veto, ``we would be taking a severe
chance in not having this legislation become law,'' he said, ``And
I would argue that we not gamble.''
   Byrd said a Senate vote on the 1,000-page bill was expected on
Tuesday, and although confident it would pass he was not sure he
could muster the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. The
House vote on the legislation was 312-107.
   If the president's veto were sustained, Byrd said the trade bill
_ a product of years of work and a House-Senate compromise on
competing bills that passed last year _ would have to start from
scratch in the process.
   ``This matter is not going to be turned around that easily and
that quickly,'' Byrd said, noting there were 170 amendments the
last time it was before the Senate.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
emphasized the broad scope of the measure, which was being obscured
by the very specific veto fight.
   Among its hundreds of provisions, the bill gives new powers to
the U.S. trade representative, repeals the windfall profits tax on
oil and relaxes controls on U.S. exports of high technology
equipment.
   ``We haven't had a trade policy ... since World War II,''
Bentsen said. Although the nation did well without one when it was
the dominant world economic power, ``that time has since changed
and now we're in tough competition,'' he said.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said he, like many Republicans,
wanted to support their president but he would vote to override.
   ``I hope that when senators vote on this bill they have their
eyes open to the consequences,'' he said of the hot election-year
issue. ``It is by no means certain that this bill can be saved in
some other form.''
   The leaders of Japan, at which much of the trade bill was aimed,
made clear Friday they would welcome its demise.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, in a nationally televised
news conference, said relations with the United States would suffer
but said he had ``strong expectations'' the legislation would die.
   Hajime Tamura, minister for international trade and industry,
said he ``deeply regretted'' House passage of the bill.
   ``While I do not think it will be passed in the Senate in the
end, I will urge the U.S. administration (to block the bill) and
await the common sense of the American people,'' Tamura said.
   The bill includes two provisions regarded as threatening to
Japanese business.
   One is the provision giving the trade representative power to
decide what constitutes unfair trade practices by another country,
and what to do about it. Another imposes sanctions against Toshiba
Corp. and its subsidiary, Toshiba Machine Co., which sold
submarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet Union in violation of a
Western trade agreement on sensitive technology exports.

   An inmate who claims he inherited $2.5 million
may not have to wait for freedom to start spending it, state
officials said Friday, because if he really has the money they want
him to fork over room and board.
   ``It seems only fair ... for inmates who have the resources to
repay their debt to society, while they're paying their debt to
society,'' said Department of Corrections spokesman Brian Fairchild.
   ``We're going to go after the money if it's there.''
   Tony Fieldman, convicted of robbing a Chicago cab driver of $60
at knifepoint on Dec. 27, 1986, told authorities at Joliet
Correctional Center his mother died and left him the money,
officials said.
   But ``we're not sure that he has in fact inherited $2.5
million,'' Fairchild said. ``He has supplied nothing to us other
than a death certificate for his mother, which is a year old.''
   If Fieldman's claim is true, corrections officials plan to seek
a court order to make him pay for the estimated $16,000-a-year cost
of housing, Fairchild said.
   Fieldman, who began serving an eight-year sentence March 25,
could be eligible for early release for good behavior in four
years, Fairchild said.
   He would run up a tab of about $64,000 for a four-year stay,
about the amount he would receive in interest on the inheritance in
that period, the spokesman said.
   Fieldman, 36, of Chicago, apparently fears greedy inmates who
got word of the purported windfall, and was moved to protective
custody earlier this week at his own request, Fairchild said.
   The Corrections Department has launched an investigation to
determine if the woman named in the death cerificate, who died in
Las Vegas, Nev., was in fact Fieldman's mother, and to see if she
did leave him the money, Fairchild said.
   He declined to release the woman's name or any additional
information about her.
   Recovering costs from inmates ``is not something that we've
routinely done in the past because usually inmates don't have those
kind of assets,'' Fairchild said.
   But requiring Fieldman to pay for room and board would not be
unprecedented, he said.
   State law authorizes the Corrections Department to seek legal
action ``to attach inmates' assets for the purpose of reimbursing
the state for costs of incarceration,'' he said.
   Work-release inmates housed at community correctional centers
must pay for room and board, Fairchild said.
   ``About 20 percent of their take-home pay is deposited in an
account that helps pay for their incarceration,'' he said, adding,
``Last year that raised almost half a million dollars for the
department.''
   Attorney John Jackson with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said he
had never heard of costs being recovered from federal inmates.
Inmate costs are covered by the federal budget ``and as far as I
know the government has always paid all of it,'' he said from
Washington, D.C.

<TEXT>
   A committee settled a feud Friday between
two groups competing to take the dramatic story of toddler Jessica
McClure's rescue from an abandoned well to television.
   The choice of a Los Angeles-based firm satisfied the two groups
of rescuers, civic leaders and Jessica's parents, ending nearly two
months of dissension that had split this West Texas city, officials
said.
   The two contending groups were municipal workers who
participated in the rescue and a group of volunteers.
   A five-member panel Mayor Carroll Thomas appointed to settle the
spat chose a television movie proposal from Los Angeles-based
Interscope Communications Inc. over one from producer Larry Spivey,
president of Highland Communications Group Inc.
   The selection of Interscope and word from the McClures' attorney
that negotiations will begin between the family and the film
company appeared to halt the months-long battle for movie rights to
Jessica's story.
   ``The Jessica McClure rescue story is the type of story which
should be told because it exemplifies the noblest aspects of the
human spirit,'' said committee Chairman Wayne Merritt, a Midland
banker.
   Jessica was 18 months old when she fell into the well in a
neighbor's yard Oct. 14. Rescuers, many of them oilfield workers,
dug a shaft through solid rock to save the toddler in a televised
58-hour effort that drew international attention.
   Proposals from Interscope and Spivey were among dozens of
proposals initially pitched to the McClures and workers involved in
the rescue. The flood of offers prompted the formation of two
rescuer's groups after disagreements arose over rights negotiations.
   Thomas appointed the committee after both groups agreed to abide
by the decision of the panel. ``The effort that was made to
reconcile was as as great as the (rescue) effort in October,'' said
Merritt.
   One group remains committed to a deal with Spivey, but spokesman
Bob Hawk said his group endorsed the committee's decision and will
talk to Spivey next week. That group consists of more than 30
volunteers.
   Another group, consisting mainly of municipal employees,
announced Friday it had disbanded because its purpose, finding a
producer, had been served.
   ``It is hoped that (the disbandment) will permit the successful
producer to deal individually with all the people in Midland which
the producer deems necessary to portray an accurate and
all-encompassing true-life story of Jessica's rescue,'' said police
Cpl. Jim White.
   Details remain to be worked out, said committee members.
   The Interscope proposal listed John Kander II as co-executive
producer with Dick Berg, who will write the script. Interscope has
produced such television movies as ``Murder Ordained'' for CBS and
such feature films as ``Three Men And A Baby,'' ``Outrageous
Fortune'' and ``Revenge of the Nerds.''
   Interscope called the story ``an important and positive
reflection not only of the strength of the human spirit, even that
of a small child, but of the strength of a community when it is
banded together at the heart.''
   The movie will be sponsored by Campbell Soup Co. and will be
shown on ABC, officials said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Friday
designed to police traffic in mislabeled drugs, but said he will
seek repeal of a provision requiring states to follow federal
standards in licensing wholesale drug distributors.
   ``I support the expressed goal of this legislation, which is to
reduce potential public health risks that may result from the
distribution of mislabled, subpotent, counterfeit or adulerated
prescriptions drugs,'' the president said.
   But he said the portion requiring federal standards to be
adhered to in licensing drug wholesalers ``represents a substantial
intrusion into traditional state responsibilities and
prerogatives.''
   ``Accordingly, I have directed the Department of Justice to
submit to the Congress legislation repealing this portion of the
bill, and I urge the Congress to enact this legislation promptly,''
Reagan said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., on Friday
asked for a ``full report'' on the government's decision to sign a
$50 million lease on a building here for Justice Department offices
in May 1987.
   The building was owned by a partnership that included members of
the Bender family, which indirectly pays the salary of Attorney
General Edwin Meese's wife, Ursula.
   ``As chairman of the Senate subcommittee with oversight of these
aspects of GSA (the General Services Administration), I am asking
GSA to provide a full report to this committee on this matter,''
Moynihan said in a statement.
   The GSA, the government's housekeeping agency, signed the lease
on the building.
   Moynihan said his interest in the Chester Arthur Building in
downtown Washington was piqued by recent news reports that the
Bender partnership sold the building for a 60 percent profit about
two weeks after signing the lease. The partnership made a profit of
$22.6 million over two years.
   The Bender Foundation, the family's tax-exempt philanthropy,
contributes the money that goes for Mrs. Meese's $40,000-a-year
salary at the Multiple Sclerosis Society.
   Meese says he had nothing to do with the lease, and that there
is no connection between his wife's job and the building's lease.
   GSA officials have said there was nothing unusual about the
lease. But Moynihan said news reports concerning the building,
where the Immigration and Naturalization Service has offices,
``raised questions'' about GSA's actions.
   Dale Bruce, a GSA spokesman, said he had not seen Moynihan's
letter, but the agency would comply with any requests from Congress.
   Although the House Public Works and Transportation Committee
regularly approves prospective leases, the parallel Senate panel
has declined to follow that procedure since the late 1970s,
according to Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt.

<HEAD>Interior Department Said To Have Understated Irrigation Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department told Congress that
irrigation subsidies in the West had been only about a quarter to
half what its own experts and White House budget officers believed
was correct, according to documents released by a House
subcommittee chairman Friday.
   The chairman, Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said the documents
indicate the department ``went to extraordinary lengths to lower
the (Bureau of Reclamation) subsidy estimate'' and ``used a subsidy
calculation it knew was inconsistent with the method in President
Reagan's fiscal year 1989 budget.''
   In February, the department told Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.,
that all past subsidies for the bureau's irrigation projects in the
West amounted to $9.8 billion in today's dollars. It said the
subsidies currently were about $543 million a year, of which an
estimated $203 million went to irrigate surplus crops receiving
other aid in Agriculture Department programs.
   Gejdenson's documents indicated that bureau and department
experts wanted to use figures of $19 billion to $24 billion for the
total historical subsidy, $2.2 billion for the annual subsidy and
$830 million for the subsidy for surplus crops.
   Miller is chairman of the water and power subcommittee of the
House Interior Committee and Gejdenson is chairman of the oversight
and investigations subcommittee.
   ``I find it incredible that an administration that professes to
support cutting farm subsidies and the federal deficit would go to
such extraordinary lengths to minimize its estimate of the subsidy
received by a select group of western farmers,'' Gejdenson wrote
Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel.
   He asked that Hodel supply new answers to Miller's questions
using calculations specified by the Office of Management and Budget
_ answers he already has in the documents, which included drafts of
the Feb. 24 reply to Miller from Wayne Marchant, principal deputy
assistant secretary for water and science, that incorporated the
OMB estimates.
   Marchant said Friday he did not know how he would reply to
Gejdenson, but ``I am confident we are correct and this is an
intellectually defensible analysis.''
   Congress provides many subsidies to irrigation projects, the
most important of which are interest-free repayment of construction
loans from the Treasury or below-market interest rates. Over the
decades, politicians from the West of all parties have jealously
protected those subsidies.
   The difference in the subsidy estimates arises largely from
disputes over what interest rates to use.
   The department used published historical long-term Treasury
borrowing rates for 1906-1957, and after that a statutory ``small
projects'' formula rate designed to reflect long-term Treasury
borrowing costs. The department's experts argued that the formula
blended historical and current rates in such a way that the real
subsidy was underestimated.
   Marchant said in an interview that his boss, assistant secretary
James Ziegler, ``is an investment banker and knows whereof he
speaks.''
   Ziegler, Marchant said, argued successfully with OMB that many
irrigation districts were the equivalent of municipal governments
with their own taxing power ``and could have qualified to borrow at
a tax-free rate,'' which would have been even lower than the
federal rate.
   Not all the difference in subsidy estimates was the result of
differing interest rates, Marchant said. Some $4.5 billion
represents federal investment not yet repaid. ``That's crazy'' to
include it, he maintained, since it will be repaid.

   Neither rain, nor
sleet nor gloom of night kept a load of mail from reaching its
destination, but a detour to Puerto Rico certainly slowed it down.
   About 2,000 pieces of mail _ including Christmas gifts and well
aged fruitcakes _ are scheduled to be delivered to this U.S.
territory on Monday, 2{ years after they were sent.
   Virgin Islands Postmaster Alvin O. Davis said he has ordered a
crew to work overtime to immediately sort the mail and send it to
the intended recipients.
   Why the delay?
   Davis said a trailer containing the mail made a stopover in
neighboring Puerto Rico in November 1985. Inexplicably, it
languished at a San Juan dock.
   Someone finally stumbled across the meandering missives, and the
mail was sent on the final, 60-mile leg of its journey.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Outline Plan To End Cambodian Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Friday offered a
three-stage plan to end the Cambodian conflict and establish a
``peaceful, independent, neutral and non-aligned'' Cambodia.
   The visiting vice foreign minister of Vietnam, Tran Quang Co
Tran, outlined the plan at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur before
continuing his Asian tour.
   ``In case there is no solution to the Cambodian problem (through
this plan) by 1990, then we (Vietnam) will solve the problem
unilaterally and we will withdraw our troops unilaterally,'' Tran
said.
   Vietnam maintains about 140,000 troops in Cambodia.
   Tran said the first move under the proposal would be holding
informal talks, as proposed earlier by Indonesia and backed in
principle by Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, comprised of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the
Philippines and Brunei.
   He said these discussions would be in two stages.
   First would be talks among the Hun Sen regime in Phnom Penh,
which was installed by Vietnam after it invaded Cambodia in late
1978, and the three factions of the Coalition Government of
Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia). Coalition guerrillas are fighting
Hun Sen and the Vietnamese from inside Cambodia near the Thai
border.
   Vietnam, like neighboring Cambodia, is communist, but the
government Vietnam installed there is pro-Vietnam and pro-Soviet
while the ousted regime was pro-China.
   The three-party coalition is headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
former head of state of Cambodia, and is made up of Sihanouk
loyalists; the pro-Peking Khmer Rouge, which killed millions of
Cambodians before being ousted by Vietnam; and the Cambodian
National Liberation Front of Son Sann. Khieu Samphan now leads the
Khmer Rouge.
   ``It is up to these Cambodians to work out what sort of peace
they want ... but it should not be something which will see a
resurgence of a genocidal regime,'' Tran said.
   He added, ``It should be a peaceful, independent, neutral and
non-aligned Cambodia.''
   The second stage would be for the Cambodians and concerned
countries like Vietnam and Indonesia to join in further informal
discussions, Tran said.
   These two stages of talks could be held in Jakarta, Indonesia,
since that country also has offered to act as host, said Tran.
   He said the third stage would be a formal, international
conference, to work out such issues as guaranteeing peace in
Cambodia and supervising a transitional phase.
   The Vietnamese official said this conference could be held in
India.
   He noted that Sihanouk; Hun Sen; Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Ho Thach and others have said India could play a role in
helping bring peace to Cambodia. He said India might also assist in
supervising the accord.
   Tran arrived in Malaysia from Indonesia on Monday and spoke at
the news conference before leaving for Thailand en route to the
Philippines.

   It's much brighter than Kohoutek or even
Halley, but amateur comet-hunters aren't amused by the new light in
the Pittsburgh sky.
   Lights beaming up from the top of a new downtown office building
are so bright, they interfere with star-gazing miles away, the
Amateur Astronomy Association of Pittsburgh claims.
   ``It's a nuisance,'' said Tom Reiland, president of the
250-member group. ``If you are an amateur who is hunting for comets
... a light like that could reduce your possibilities of being able
to discover (them).''
   Reiland said he noticed the effect with his naked eye from the
association's observatory 12 miles away from the edifice, which
opened last week.
   Andy Gildersleeve, project manager of the 31-story Fifth Avenue
Place, said workers were experimenting with the lighting. The
lights' intensity is likely to diminish after the experiments, he
said, but added that the building probably will remain the city's
brightest.

average stuff for your athletic beach bum: a run in the sand, a
30-minute swim and a plentiful diet.
   But Speedy is a crab, and he's preparing for a 2.5-meter race
that will kick off this coastal community's tourist season. The
race is Westport's answer to the popular slug races in Elma, 35
miles to the east.
   ``I've had my crab in training for almost three weeks,'' said
Speedy's owner, Mike Sigler, office manager of the
Westport-Grayland Chamber of Commerce and an organizer of the event.
   ``Every morning I take him out to Westhaven State Park and
exercise Speedy in the sand,'' he said. ``It builds muscle tone.
Then I bring him back and make sure he eats real well.''
   Participants can enter their own crab in the race or use one
provided by the organizers.
   The event also includes a crab feed _ runners not included.

   U.S. officials said Friday they had no
confirmation that the hijackers of the Kuwaiti Airlines jet had
left Algeria, despite published reports they had flown to Syria or
Lebanon.
   ``There are conflicting reports about the whereabouts of the
hijackers, but we have no indication they have left Algeria. The
question of where they are should be addressed to the government of
Algeria,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told
reporters. She declined to elaborate.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Oakley said ``we don't know where the
hijackers are.'' But an administration source said that on the
basis of new information, the department had modified its position.
   ``Something came in that made us able to say that,'' said the
source, speaking on condition that he not be further identified.
   But the source declined to specify the nature of the
information, and said: ``We cannot say with certainty that they are
still in Algeria.''
   Mrs. Oakley has said U.S. officials were discussing whereabouts
of the hijackers with Algerian authorities.
   A Soviet-built Antonov transport of the Algerian air force was
seen taking off from the Algiers airport before dawn Wednesday,
shortly before the hostages left the hijacked plane. It was widely
assumed the hijackers were aboard.
   Western diplomats have said the hijackers went to Beirut. But
officials at Beirut airport denied they landed there.
   The New York Times in Friday editions quoted unidentified Arab
officials as saying the hijackers were flown on a private Algerian
jet to Damascus, Syria, and were believed to have traveled overland
from there to Lebanon.
   But there was no independent confirmation that they were in
Lebanon.
   Kuwait and other Arab nations lauded Algeria for winning freedom
for the hostages without additional violence. But the United
States, Britain and other Western powers criticized Algeria for
allowing the hijackers to get away.

<HEAD>Report Hits S&L Property Agency; Chairman's Resignation Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publication Friday of a highly critical
congressional report on a federal agency created to manage and sell
property from insolvent savings institutions was followed by an
announcement that the agency's chairman had resigned last month.
   The report, by the staff of the House Banking Committee, charged
that the Federal Asset Disposition Association has become a
``bloated bureacracy'' that wastes millions of dollars of public
money.
   Committee Chairman Fernand G. St Germain, D-R.I., in an written
statement accompanying the report, said FADA should be phased out
as soon as possible and its duties reassumed by the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp., which backs deposits in federally insured
S&Ls.
   The House report was dated March 17, but it was not made public
until Friday, when it was published in the Congressional Record.
   In a letter dated March 31, but not released by FADA until
Friday, the agency's chairman, William F. McKenna submitted his
resignation, effective immediately.
   McKenna, a Los Angeles attorney, wrote that his resignation ``is
intended to open the way'' for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which regulates 3,147 federal thrift institutions, to pick his
replacement and ``achieve maximum capability with FADA's new
executive command and chartered course.''
   He has been replaced, on an acting basis, by Vice Chairman John
B. Zellars, chairman of Georgia Federal Bank in Atlanta.
   McKenna was previously chairman of the Federal Savings and Loan
Advisory Council, an industry group that advises federal
regulators. His law firm represents some of the largest S&Ls in the
industry and the creation of FADA was his idea.
   The stated purpose of FADA is bring money into the S&L insurance
fund, at a time when it is short of funds to resolve the problems
of soaring insolvencies, particularly in Texas and other states
hard hit by depressed oil prices.
   However, the House report said ``the unspoken agenda was to give
the savings and loan industry, more specifically a small but very
powerful subgroup of the industry, a major say in how the thrift
industry's problems would be resolved.''
   The report said it was ``difficult to determine'' how much money
FADA has wasted, but it said has directly charged $20 million to
receiverships set up to liquidate failed S&Ls and it has passed on
$51 million in subcontractor costs. Despite this income, FADA is
more than $15 million in the red, the report said.
   Money spent by the receiverships is deducted from what is
eventually left for the creditors of failed institutions, including
depositors over the insurance limit of $100,000.
   Gerald Carmen, who took over as FADA chief executive in
February, said he is working to remedy the agency's faults.
   ``We know there have been problems with FADA and that's why they
brought me aboard,'' he said. ``I have not read the report, but
when I do read it, problems that are real and exist, we're going to
fix.''
   Carmen said he hoped within six months to resolve ``long-range
and strategic'' questions, such as whether FADA should be merged
with the insurance fund, be completely privatized or continue under
its present structure.
   He said he has reduced the FADA payroll from 388 to 370
employees, saving $1 million a year and is consolidating FADA
office space for a reduction of 16,000 square feet. He predicted
FADA would be in the black for the first quarter of the year.
   ``I think we're starting to bring it under control,'' Carmen
said.
   However, the House report described reform efforts so far as
``cosmetic'' and as public relations ``intended to defuse
criticism.''
   Among the other findings of the House report:
   _FADA employees awarded contracts, without bidding, to former
business associates.
   _``FADA officials lived first class and received excessive
salaries and bonuses.'' It said its top 32 executives were paid
over $3 million in 1987 and its total payroll of $22 million went
to more 380 employees.
   _From its creation in late 1985 to the end of last year, it
managed to sell only $124 million of the property in its care.
   _``Certain FADA employees continue to maintain financial
interests in firms that could benefit from FADA contracts.''
   William Fulwider, a spokesman for the bank board, said the
information in the House report is dated. He said FADA is reducing
its expenses and is cooperating more fully with FSLIC.
   Mark Clark, a vice president of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the largest trade group in the industry, said league
officials would have no immediate comment.

<HEAD>Thailand Softens Stand on Vietnamese Refugees, Will Open Center</HEAD>

   Thailand, which has been criticized for
rejecting boat people, will expand a refugee center in order to
accommodate up to 10,000 arrivals, officials said Friday.
   But to prevent a flood of escapees from Vietnam, those housed at
the center will not be eligible for resettlement in third
countries, the officials said.
   ``The door has been somewhat opened,'' said one official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. However, he said Thailand's
recent policy of turning back Vietnamese boat people could be
reinstated and that in some cases it was still being carried out.
   Thailand was criticized by some international aid agencies and
the U.S. government for pushing Vietnamese boats back out to sea.
Some reports have claimed that 100 to 170 refugees may have drowned
after their boats were turned away from Thailand early this year.
   Thai officials, speaking at a background briefing, said Thailand
adopted tough measures because Western governments were not living
up to their agreement to accept the refugees.
   They also said there was no end in sight to the flow of
immigrants and the new arrivals were ``economic migrants'' rather
than people fleeing persecution.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
tough stance had been modified because of ``hopeful signs,''
including a greater movement of refugees from Thailand to the
United States and a growing realization by the international
community that Indochinese refugees had to be resettled.
   They indicated that Thailand was also unhappy about the adverse
publicty surrounding the rejection of the boat people.
   The officials said an annex was being constructed at Site 2, a
camp along the border with Cambodia, to house 8,000 to 10,000
Vietnamese. The camp, to be administered by the Thai military,
already holds more than 900 Vietnamese boat people and 4,000 who
fled Vietnam by land and crossed Cambodia.
   About 2,600 Vietnamese now along the Thai coast will be moved to
the Site 2 annex.
   Another 15,000 Vietnamese are being housed at Phanat Nikhom, a
transit center for Indochinese refugees, including Cambodians and
Laotians.
   This center is to be closed to new Vietnamese arrivals and
pressure will be exerted on the United States and other countries
to accept those currently there, the officials said.
   ``Thirteen years after the Vietnam war we have gone beyond a
certain threshold,'' one official said. ``Those now coming are not
the traditional boat people. Most are looking for better economic
opportunities.''
   The Thai government ordered the Vietnamese boats turned away
when the numbers of refugees jumped dramatically at the end of last
year and rose to 2,500 in January 1988 alone.
   Many arrived via Cambodia with the aid of smugglers.
   The officials said reports of deaths had been exaggerated. They
said less than 100 Vietnamese perished and fewer than 20 bodies had
been recovered in Thai waters.
   ``It was never the willful or malicious intent of the royal Thai
government to cause harm or injury to Vietnamese asylum-seekers,''
the background paper said.
   Thailand has since 1975 provided temporary refuge for over 1
million Indochinese refugees.
   The Vietnamese are regarded as illegal immigrants, but a large
number have in the past been allowed by local authorities to land
without problems.
   The officials indicated the law would remain ambiguous although
there had been a recent ``softening'' of Thai attitude. The
background paper said those who would not be allowed to land on
Thai shores would be given food, water and fuel and their boats
would be repaired if necessary.
   ``A major influx could unravel these new arrangements,'' one
official said. He noted that since January, the number of arrivals
had dropped dramatically, but he did not provide a number.

   Outraged Florida State University
officials suspended Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity Friday after a grand
jury said an intoxicated, 18-year-old woman student was raped at
the fraternity house and the group's members refused to cooperate
with the investigation.
   The young woman was found March 5 with ``crude words'' and a
fraternity symbol written on her thigh, a Leon County grand jury
said Thursday in an interim report.
   She had been raped by more than one person, her clothing was in
disarray, she had suffered multiple scratches and abrasions, and
she was so drunk that her life was in danger, the report said.
   ``We informed Pi Kappa Alpha they are suspended immediately
pending a formal hearing which will begin next Wednesday,'' Dean of
Students James Hayes said Friday. ``They are no longer a registered
student organization at FSU. They lose all rights and privileges.'''
   The incident marked the second time in a week the fraternity was
suspended on a Florida campus. The Pi Kappa Alpha chapter at
Stetson University in Deland was suspended April 15 in the wake of
reports of a similar incident.
   Stetson Dean of Student Affairs Garth Jenkins has said a young
woman reported she was sexually assaulted by more than one man
during a fraternity party April 9. He also said he heard reports
that other people watched the alleged assault.
   The executive vice president of the Memphis, Tenn.-based
national fraternity, Ray Orians, said there were roughly 130
fraternity members at Florida State and 70 at Stetson.
Investigators for the national organization visted both campuses
this week, he said.
   ``We're looking at this (Florida State incident), at this point,
as an individual incident involving an individual member that had
nothing to do with the chapter,'' he said.
   ``In the Stetson case, we do know there was some violations of
school rules, separate and apart from any sexual allegations,''
said Orians. Stetson is a Baptist university.
   Hayes said Florida State officials were sickened over police
information and the grand jury's interim report on the incident
there. No individuals have been charged, but the investigation was
continuing.
   ``When you have 25,000 students, you have disciplinary problems,
but a situation like this hasn't happened in my nine years here,''
said Hayes.
   The president of the fraternity, Brant Byrd of Bellair, told the
Florida Flambeau, a student newspaper, that he was advised not to
talk in public about the incident.
   ``My comment is that I'm very involved with final exams and exam
week and my attorney told me not to concentrate on the grand jury
but to concentrate on final exams,'' the Flambeau reported Friday.
   The panel's report criticized the fraternity for not cooperating
and urged witnesses to step forward.
   ``Possible witnesses have a civic and moral duty to come forward
and report what they have seen or what they have heard from or
about the perpetrators of this sordid incident,'' the grand jury
stated.
   The 18-year-old Florida State University student was found raped
and ``intoxicated to a life-threatening degree'' early on March 5,
the grand jury said.
   The victim was found on the floor of the Theta Chi fraternity
house, about a block from the Pi Kappa Alpha house, at about 5:30
a.m. and taken to a hospital for treatment and an examination.
   The grand jury said members of Theta Chi and of Sigma Chi
fraternity, where the victim said she had visited earlier, were
cooperative. Campus police determined members of those two
organizations were not involved and knew nothing about the victim
or the crime.
   By contrast, Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity members were
uncooperative and evasive, the grand jury said.
   The victim told authorities she had met a Pi Kappa Alpha member
at a club, where she had been drinking beer and tequila. She said
he took her to his fraternity house, giving her a bottle of wine,
which she consumed.
   ``She alleges her host then sexually assaulted her, and she
passed out from intoxication,'' wrote the grand jury.
   A medical examination revealed that the victim had a 0.349
blood-alcohol level, more than three times the legal limit for
driving, and had been raped by more than one person, according to
the grand jury report.
   ``She was comatose,'' said police Lt. Jack Handley, adding that
sexual intercourse had occurred during the time she was
unconscious. ``She was in a life-threatening situation.''
   Handley declined to give details on the words or the symbol
written on the woman's thigh, except to say it was a fraternity
symbol but not the symbol of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.
   The woman was released from the hospital March 6. Hayes said she
has been receiving counseling. The drinking age in Florida is 21.
   Meanwhile, fraternity and sorority pledging was suspended on the
State University of New York at Albany on Friday after a student
was electrocuted when he waded into a pond during an apparent
fraternity stunt.
   Bryan Higgins, 20, a sophomore from Mahopac, N.Y., died after he
walked into the pond wearing only his underwear around 6:15 p.m.
Thursday.
   Albany County District Attorney Sol Greenburg said the death
appeared accidental and the incident appeared to be a non-violent
hazing. Two other students were injured by the electric current in
the concrete-lined pond.
   The reason the pond had current running through it was not
immediately determined. The current disappeared when switches to
electrical circuits near the pond were turned off Thursday night,
officials said.

<HEAD>Postpartum Depression: Factor in Mother's Killing of Infant?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother who allegedly drowned her 2-month-old
son in a bathtub to stop his crying was ordered held on $75,000
bail Friday on a second-degree murder charge and barred from
unsupervised visits with her other son.
   Lucretia Gentile, 36, who appeared before Brooklyn Criminal
Court Judge Mickey Scherer, called police Wednesday to report her
infant son, Stephen, had been kidnapped.
   She broke down Thursday during a polygraph test at FBI
headquarters in Manhattan, telling detectives about her son's death
and directing them to a trash can near her home where the body was
found, authorities said.
   Child abuse experts said Friday that Mrs. Gentile appeared to be
a victim of postpartum depression, probably seeing no other way out.
   ``What's mind-boggling to me is the friends, family and
neighbors of this woman didn't see what was happening to this
mother,'' said Dr. Vincent J. Fontana, chairman of Mayor's Task
Force on Child Abuse and Neglect.
   ``Postpartum depression is a disease,'' Fontana said. ``It can
make a loving, caring mother feel like killing herself and her
baby.''
   Mrs. Gentile, a full-time homemaker, was alone when the baby
died. Her husband, John, was at work and the couple's 7-year-old
son, John, was at school.
   ``He was colicky and she had postpartum depression. She had a
difficult pregnancy, a difficult birth, the kid was up all night
and she couldn't sleep. She just snapped,'' a police source said of
the case.
   Postpartum depression can cause irritability, exhaustion,
insomnia and confusion about child care. Fontana estimated it
strikes 70 percent of mothers in one form or another.
   ``With the disappearance of the extended family, the usual
support systems _ a maiden aunt, widowed sister, other relatives _
are gone,'' said Dr. Maria New, chairwoman of the pediatric
department at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
   Mrs. Gentile's attorney, John DePaola, said his client ``had
been on an emotional roller coaster'' since 1984. She had had an
accidental sterilization by a doctor, followed by a subsequent
operation to correct that condition and a very difficult Caesarean
section birth, he said.
   DePaola refused to comment on his defense strategy after
Friday's hearing.
   In a Vermont case three months ago, Michelle Remington, 29, was
acquitted by reason of insanity in the shooting death of her
6-week-old son after her lawyers argued she suffered from severe
postpartum depression.
   In a 1985 case in Pennsylvania, 28-year-old Sharon Kay Comitz
pleaded guilty but mentally ill to third-degree murder after
throwing her month-old son into a freezing mountain stream. She is
serving an eight-to-20 year sentence in the death.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega asked the
Reagan administration Friday to resume negotiations next month on
``national security'' matters of mutual concern.
   He suggested the meetings begin May 15 at Manzanillo on Mexico's
west coast, site of several rounds in 1984. The United States
suspended the negotiations in January 1985.
   Ortega also claimed the U.S. decision to give non-lethal aid to
Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras violated agreements between the
rebels, known as Contras, and his leftist Sandinista government. He
said the move encouraged military hardliners in the Contra
leadership.
   At a news conference in Managua, he accused the United States of
concealing weapons and ammunition in shipments of humanitarian aid
to rebels in Honduran camps.
   On the matter of U.S.-Nicaraguan negotiations, Ortega said it
was time President Reagan fulfilled a promise of talks he made last
year.
   Reagan told the Organization of American States in November that
Secretary of State George P. Shultz was prepared to meet the
Sandinistas as part of discussions with other Central American
countries ``once serious negotiations'' on a Nicaraguan cease-fire
were under way.
   ``We have met with the Contras, there is a cease-fire, there is
an agreement and the time has come for the U.S. government to show
consistency by meeting with Nicaragua to discuss matters of
national security,'' Ortega said.
   He said the Nicaraguan proposal for talks would be delivered by
Carlos Tunnerman, ambassador to Washington, who was called home
Thursday for consultations. Tunnerman and Foreign Minister Miguel
d'Escoto attended the news conference.
   ``We are offering to discuss topics of security,'' Ortega said.
``The U.S. government has singled out Nicaragua as a security
threat and we are willing to discuss that and we also want to be
heard about how Nicaragua has lived under a state of aggression by
the United States.''
   He urged Washington to lift its economic embargo on Nicaragua,
declaring: ``Favorable conditions exist for Reagan and Congress to
act constructively, but ... the U.S. government's attitude
continues to be negative.''
   Ortega said he discussed U.S. humanitarian aid to Contras in
Honduras with that country's president, Jose Azcona Hoyo, who said
he was informed by the United States that the rebels ``were dying
of hunger.''
   An agreement between the Contra leadership and Nicaraguan
government allows humanitarian aid to be distributed through
neutral international organizations when the rebels are settled in
designated cease-fire zones in Nicaragua.
   The Nicaraguan leader said he told Azcona the Contras in
Honduras should be considered ``refugees, disarmed and relocated
away from the Nicaraguan border,'' or enter Nicaragua and join
other rebels in the areas assigned.
   An agreement between the Nicaraguan government and Contra
leaders provides for rebels to assemble in seven designated areas
during the first two weeks of May.
   Ortega said non-lethal aid, most of it food, was being flown
from Toncontin Airport in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, to
camps controlled by Contra commanders who oppose the cease-fire.
   He said he told Azcona ``the advisable thing would be to tell
AID (the U.S. Agency for International Development) to wait until
the negotiations between the Nicaraguan Resistance (Contras) and
the government agree on the way the rebels enter the assigned areas
or become refugees (in Honduras).''
   An AID official said Thursday the first truckloads of food
arrived at rebel camps inside Honduras this week. He said the
shipments were sent from Tegucigalpa after being inspected by
independent observers to make sure they did not contain arms.
   Contra and government leaders signed an agreement March 23 to
end the civil war, which the government says has cost more than
26,000 lives since 1981. A 60-day cease-fire began April 1.

<HEAD>US, Pakistani Officials React Cautiously To Soviet Aide's Remarks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Pakistani officials said they would
welcome an end to Soviet arms shipments to the Kremlin-backed
regime in Afghanistan but reacted cautiously to statements along
that line by a senior aide to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   State Department spokesman Phyllis Oakley said that the United
States ``will continue to supply the resistance as long as the
Soviet Union continues supplying arms to the (Kabul) regime.''
   ``We have also made clear that we would prefer a complete
cessation of military aid by both'' the United States and the
Soviet Union, who are acting as guarantors of an agreement signed
in Geneva on the withdrawal of an estimated 120,000 Soviet troops
form Afghanistan, she said.
   Yevgeny Primakov, who has advised Gorbachev on the Afghan war,
was quoted in The Washington Post on Friday as saying the Soviet
Union was not planning to continue shipping arms to the Kabul
regime.
   ``We don't need to supply,'' said Primakov. ``We aren't going to
supply if the Americans aren't going to supply. But we aren't going
to restrict our relations with the Afghan government'' headed by
the Kremlin ally, Najibullah.
   Primakov's remarks appeared to break sharply with a position the
Soviets have held since January. The Kremlin refused an American
proposal to end aid simultaneously, a formula known in diplomatic
jargon as negative symmetry, and insisted instead continuing aid,
described as positive symmetry.
   Moreover, Western diplomats in Islamabad said Tuesday that
Soviet aircraft were flying night missions into Kabul, shipping
tons of arms from the Soviet Union.
   Asked to assess Primakov's remarks, Mrs. Oakley said ``it is not
clear what time frame he is addressing. If Mr. Primakov is
indicating an authoritative Soviet position on restraint during
withdrawal, which we have proposed, we welcome it.''
   The United States has accelerated the flow of aid to the
mujahedeen guerrillas across the Pakistani border, and the Soviet
Union has stepped up its shipments of arms to the Najibullah
regime, according to American officials.
   Primakov made his remarks to a group of Americans visiting
Kabul, a trip that Pakistani and U.S. officials said appeared
designed to give ``respectability'' to the Najibullah regime.
   One Pakistani diplomat said Primakov's remarks might be designed
to put pressure on Pakistan to stop U.S. arms from moving through
its territory.
   ``We have to take Primakov's statement carefully,'' said the
Pakistani diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Officials
of the Afghan regime ``are trying to gain some respectability with
this group of influential Americans,'' said the official.
   A State Department source said that Primakov's comments appeared
to be part of a campaign to pressure Paskistan, but predicted it
would not work.
   ``I think that the Soviets will be making statements like this
from time to time,'' said the source, who spoke on condition that
he not be further identified.
   ``If the intent is to pressure Pakistan, then I don't think it
will achieve that result. I think it will stiffen the Pakistani
resolve,'' said the source.

<HEAD>Britain Orders Ships to Stop Visits to Denmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain ordered its warships Friday to steer clear
of Denmark, whose toughened ban on nuclear weapons has brought
criticism from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Britain's Foreign Office said Friday that it has suspended Royal
Navy ship visits to Denmark until after a general election there
scheduled for May 10.
   Last week, Danish socialists forced a resolution through the
country's Parliament requiring the government to tell visiting
ships that nuclear arms are barred from Danish ports in peacetime.
   Britain refuses to say whether its ships carry nuclear arms.
   A brief British Foreign Office announcement said that ``in view
of the Danish general election, the British and Danish governments
have agreed it would be appropriate to postpone a number of British
navy visits which had been scheduled in the coming week.''
   It was the first such boycott by a member of the NATO alliance.
   British sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear
weapons is ``an absolute matter of principle _ there is no
exception.''
   Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, whose center-right
coalition is opposed to the nuclear weapons resolution, called a
new election rather than impose the measure.
   Denmark, like NATO member Norway, has for 30 years officially
banned nuclear weapons from its ports in peacetime. But both
countries avoided controversy over the issue by not asking whether
visiting ships carried nuclear weapons.
   The new Danish resolution underlined the dilemma posed by a NATO
member opposed to nuclear weapons, which are considered fundamental
to the defense strategy of the 16-nation alliance.
   Britain, the United States and other several other NATO
countries have stopped naval visits to New Zealand, a non-NATO
member which bans nuclear weapons on its territory.
   Danish newspapers reported Friday that West Germany sent a
strong letter to Foreign Minister Uff Ellemann-Jensen protesting
the resolution.
   West Germany is Denmark's closest NATO ally. The two nations
share a concern over the defense of the Baltic Sea and its narrow
approaches, which are under Danish control.
   The U.S. government and NATO Secretary-General Lord Carrington
also have publicly criticized the resolution.
   The British decision meant canceling visits by six ships,
including a destroyer, HMS Bristol, and a frigate, HMS Euryalus,
officials said. The other ships involved are three minesweepers and
a survey vessel.

<HEAD>Thai Official Says Reagan Will Pressure Soviets on Cambodia Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan assured a visiting delegation
from Thailand on Friday that he will intensify pressure on the
Soviets to bring about a settlement in Cambodia, Thai Foreign
Minister Siddhi Savetsila said.
   In an interview with wire service reporters, the Thai official
said Reagan vowed during a brief meeting at the White House that he
would raise the Cambodia issue when he goes to Moscow at the end of
May for a summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The situation in Cambodia always has been on the U.S.-Soviet
agenda of regional issues, but Thai officials have complained that
at earlier summits the United States wasn't forceful enough in
pressing the Soviets to use their influence with Vietnam to pull
out of Cambodia.
   Savetsila said the Soviet decision to withdraw from Afghanistan
after eight years raises hopes that the Cambodian situation will
emerge as the top item on the U.S.-Soviet agenda on regional hot
spots.
   The occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam, which receives armaments
and vast economic aid from Moscow, has been blamed for unrest and
violence along the Thai border and for causing hundreds of
thousands of people to flee into Thailand.
   Igor Rogachev, the Soviet deputy foreign minister for Asian
affairs, told officials in Bangkok earlier this week that his
nation's influence with the Vietnamese is limited. Savetsila said,
however, ``if the Soviets are willing to do it,'' they can pressure
Vietnam to withdraw.
   ``I think the Soviets are eager to have some political solution
to the Cambodian problem,'' Savetsila said.
   Savetsila denounced a proposal by Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.,
that the United States open a diplomatic interest section in
Vietnam to coordinate U.S.-Vietnamese efforts to find the estimated
1,700 American servicemen still listed as missing in Vietnam after
the Vietnam War.
   At a time when Southeast Asian and Western nations are pressing
Vietnam to pull out of Cambodia, the opening of such a diplomatic
office ``would send the wrong signal,'' the foreign minister said.
   Savetsila said he exchanged assurances with Reagan and with
Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead that both nations would
continue to play their appointed roles in the ongoing Indochina
refugee crisis.
   Thailand reluctantly has agreed to continue as the country of
``first-asylum'' for the refugees as long as other countries like
the United States promise to resettle them. Since 1975, more than
675,000 refugees have fled Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos and many of
them still remain in camps in Thailand.
   United Nations refugee workers, backed by U.S. officials, have
complained in recent months that refugees fleeing in boats have
been pushed back to sea by Thai authorities. Savetsila repeated
Thai assertions that ``smugglers,'' not Thai officials, were
responsible for harming the refugees.
   Given what he termed ``refugee fatigue'' _ the growing
disinclination by the Thai people to care for the influx of
refugees _ ``it would be counterproductive'' for the United States
to berate his country about its refugee policies, Savetsila said.
   Meanwhile, Reagan sent to the Senate for ratification a treaty
with Thailand covering mutual assistance in criminal matters, which
was signed in Bangkok on March 19, 1986.
   The treaty is one of a series being negotiated by the United
States to assist in prosecution of members of drug cartels, white
collar criminals and terrorists. It provides for cooperation in
such things as the taking of testimony, serving documents and
executing requests for searches and seizures.

   State officials say a black Robeson County
jail inmate probably would still be alive if jail workers had
called an ambulance more quickly after he fell ill, but the sheriff
of the racially divided county accused investigators of slipshod
work.
   Billy McKellar died Jan. 12 after an asthma attack in the jail,
and his death and the tensions it created was cited as a factor in
the takeover of the Robesonian newspaper office for several hours
the following month.
   ``The response time was initially slow after the jailer was
notified of the problem _ and was inexcusably slow after he
verified the situation later,'' said Phil Kirk, chairman of a
special task force appointed by Gov. Jim Martin to study the
McKellar case.
   The task force was formed after the newspaper takeover, which
ended peacefully. Tuscarora Indians Eddie Hatcher and Timothy
Jacobs are accused of taking hostages at the Robesonian and
demanding an investigation into the death of McKellar and other
alleged corruption among law enforcement officials in Robeson
County.
   Since then, the predominantly rural county, whose population is
almost evenly divided among whites, blacks and Indians, has also
been rocked by the shooting death of an Indian activist who was
running for judge. Authorities later blamed the death on a romantic
dispute, not political differences.
   The state report released by Kirk says that jailers failed to
respond properly to McKellar's asthma attack Jan. 12, but Kirk said
the negligence was not criminal.
   ``There was neglect, but we couldn't find any reason to suggest
that it was intentional,'' Kirk told the Winston-Salem Journal on
Thursday. ``We didn't see any criminal intent _ just neglect of
duty.''
   The report further concludes that a staffing shortage, a broken
alarm system and McKellar's periodic refusal to take his medication
all contributed to his death.
   Sheriff Hubert Stone condemned the report.
   ``There are enough generalities and loose ends in the narrative
to make your report seem more an allegation than an
investigation,'' Stone wrote in a formal response.
   ``I think that's just political rhetoric _ just defensive
talk,'' Kirk said. ``We're not out to get Stone. If we had been, we
wouldn't have asked for his comments.''
   McKellar became sick near dinner time, according to the report,
and several inmates began calling the jailer for help. The jailer,
who was doing two jobs at once because the jail was short-staffed
that evening, didn't come until 6:43 p.m., when he passed through
the cell block on his regular rounds.
   At that time the jailer gave McKellar a pill. But McKellar's
condition didn't improve, prompting the inmates to renew their
calls for help, the report said.
   The jailer called an ambulance for McKellar at 8:41 p.m. The
vehicle arrived three minutes later, just as McKellar slumped over
without breath or pulse, the report says.
   Dr. John Butts, the state's chief medical examiner who assisted
the task force in investigating the death, said an ambulance should
have been called earlier. Even calling an ambulance roughly 20
minutes earlier would probably have saved the inmate, he said.
   Meanwhile, a lawyer for accused hostage-taker Jacobs said Friday
that his car was shot at in Robeson County as he drove to interview
a witness, but he refused to report the incident to local
authorities.
   ``This was a sniper-type thing,'' said Bob Warren. ``I was shot
at. ... But we are not going to be intimidated.''
   Warren said the incident occurred at about 2:40 p.m. Wednesday
in Lumberton. He did not report the incident officially for almost
24 hours, when he filled out a report at the police department in
Carrboro, where his office is based, about 100 miles from the scene
of the incident.
   ``I wasn't about to go to the people in Robeson County,'' Warren
said. ``I'm investigating them. We asked the FBI to come in, but
they refused because they said it was a local matter.''
   ``The Constitution is not in effect in Robeson County,'' he
said. ``That's why we have to go to these ridiculous extremes.''
   The Carrboro police report said an unspecified ``projectile''
hit the windshield of Warren's car and that ballistics tests would
be needed to determine whether it was a bullet.

<HEAD>UPI Asks Court To Halt Arbitration, Void Bargaining Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new owners of United Press International
asked a federal court Friday to rule they have no collective
bargaining agreement with the Wire Service Guild and to deny the
union's demand for arbitration.
   New UPI Inc., United Press International Inc., and Mario Vazquez
Rana filed suit in U.S. District Court here, claiming their
obligation to abide by an expired bargaining agreement ended Nov.
1, 1987, after 92 bargaining sessions over a seven-month period.
   The union filed its demand for arbitration with the American
Arbitration Association on Jan. 27, 1988, citing an ``evergreen''
provision of the bargaining agreement that allows the pact to
continue during negotiations.
   ``The issue is whether the evergreen clause is in effect only
during fruitful negotiations,'' said Dwight Geduldig, a spokesman
for UPI in Washington. ``The last negotiations were not fruitful.''
   Negotiations were last held in March, but both union and UPI
spokesmen characterized them as unsuccessful and non-productive.
   ``It appears that the company is not interested in seeking a
constructive relationship with the union,'' said Sean McCormally,
an editor on UPI's Washington desk who is also the union's chairman
of negotiations.
   ``Everyone agrees _ including management _ that a strike would
be lethal to the company,'' McCormally said. ``We are interested in
seeing the company survive. Why management is interested in
brutalizing the company, I don't know.''
   Geduldig said that the company is unwilling to bargain with
union officials.
   ``There are no negotiations scheduled at this time and it is
difficult to say that there will be future arbitration,'' Geduldig
said.
   The suit affects between 500 and 600 of the company's more than
800 employees on the news and photo staffs of the wire serice's
international news operations.
   UPI announced March 30 that they would seek to reach
profitability within two years by eliminating 150 jobs, focusing on
business news and embarking on joint electronic ventures.
   Chairman Earl W. Brian and president Paul Steinle acquired
operating control of UPI from Vazquez Rana on Feb. 19.
   UPI lost $20 million in 1987.
   Brian is chairman of WNW Group, the media investment company
that operates UPI, and of Infotech, a New York-based information
technology and venture capital firm.
   Vazquez Rana rescued UPI from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings
in June 1986 by purchasing the company for $41 million. He
reportedly put an additional $50 million into UPI before he
relinquished control of his stock for 10 years to Brian's WNW Group
in February for an undisclosed cash payment.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special commission on Friday
criticized the investigation into the 1986 assassination of Prime
Minister Olof Palme and recommended the creation of a part-time
police unit to combat terrorism.
   The commission, headed by a former district governor and
including a former prime minister, also proposed stripping courts
of the power to deport suspected terrorists and giving that
authority to the government.
   Parliament appointed the seven-member panel 13 months ago.
Commission members told a news conference they still had no clue to
the identity of Palme's killer or his motive.
   The commission was named to review earlier inquiries into the
assassination of Palme, who was shot to death as he and his wife
strolled along a Stockholm street on Feb. 28, 1986. It also was
told to recommend crime-fighting procedures.
   Reports from the earlier investigations said police responded
slowly to the killing and criticized procedures in organizing the
search for the gunman.
   Sweden, where violent crimes and political violence are rare,
has resisted forming an anti-terrorist squad with opponents saying
such a force could introduce a ``brutalizing'' element into police
work.
   To counter such a possibility, the special commission suggested
a 50-member elite unit, with officers assigned to regular police
duties two-thirds of the time and anti-terrorist work the remaining
third.
   It would be up to the government to convene the force for
possible action, and the Cabinet would have a special security
adviser.
   Commission chairman Ragnar Edenman said Hans Holmer, the
Stockholm police chief who headed the assassination investigation
for the first year, ``abused his power'' by focusing on a Kurdish
exile group and ignoring the advice of civilian prosecutors.
   In Sweden, prosecutors conduct criminal investigations in
conjunction with police and advise officers on evidence needed for
convictions.
   Edenman said prosectors should take a stronger role and police
``should be the instruments of the prosecutors.''
   Panel members included Thorbjorn Falldin, a conservative
politician who was prime minister between two socialist
administrations headed by Palme and representatives of other
political parties in Parliament.
   The commission dismissed proposals that bodyguards be mandatory
for all Cabinet ministers. ``It is ... out of the question to force
these persons by law to have a bodyguard,'' the report said.
   Palme had given his bodyguards the evening off on the night when
he was killed. He was shot in the back as he was walking home with
his wife Lisbet after attending a movie.

<HEAD>USDA Issues New Rules To Prevent Trauma To Show Horses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New interim rules have been adopted which will
gradually put into effect federal restrictions on the height of
hoof pads used on Tennessee Walking Horses and other show horses to
give them distinctive gaits, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The new rules will take effect on Monday, said James W. Glosser,
acting administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service.
   From April 25 through July 31, pads may be no more than three
inches high; from Aug. 1 through Oct. 31, two inches; and,
effective Nov. 1, no more than one-half inch high covering the sole
of the foot.
   At that time, however, an additional half-inch-high ``rim'' pad
will be allowed between the full pad and the shoe. All pads must be
made of leather or other similar soft, pliable material.
   Glosser said the new rules prohibit chains or rollers that weigh
more than six ounces, including the weight of the fastener. Weights
on the hoof other than the specified pads are also prohibited,
except for horseshoes weighing up to 16 ounces.
   Glosser said the reason the restrictions on pad height are being
phased-in is to prevent trauma to show horses, many of which
currently have pads that are four inches high.
   ``To remove four-inch pads abruptly could cause stress on a
horse's feet and limbs,'' he said.
   The new rules allow gradual reductions to reach a pad height
that could not reasonably be expected to causing soring, Glosser
said.
   Agency officials will continue to monitor horse shows and work
with the industry to prevent soring, he said.
   ``If we find sored horses, we will take action against the
responsible parties, regardless of the devices used,'' Glosser said.
   The Horse Protection Act was passed in 1970 to eliminate the
practice of ``soring'' to produce special gaits in horses.
   ``Soring is the use of cruel methods, devices or chemical
substances on a horse's legs or feet that can reasonably be
expected to cause a horse to experience pain when walking,'' the
agency said in its statement. ``Soring is done primarily to alter a
horse's gait in the show ring.''
   The new interim rules apply to all breeds of horses at shows or
sales, the agency said.
   On March 21, a U.S. District Court here, in a lawsuit brought
against USDA by the American Horse Protection Association,
invalidated certain sections of the department's horse protection
regulations.
   In the court order and a clarifying order issued April 13, the
court directed USDA to initiate rulemaking to eliminate devices
that could reasonably be expected to cause soring, the agency said.
The court specifically referred to pads and chains used on the
front feet and legs of horses to alter their gaits.
   Before the court order, there was no limit on the height of pads
in USDA's regulations, except for those on yearling horses,
although the industry had its own rule limiting pads to four inches.
   The previous USDA regulations also put a 16-ounce weight limit
on horseshoes for yearlings, but had no weight limit on shoes for
older horses. The weight limit on chains was eight ounces for
two-year-olds and 10 ounces for horses three years or older.

   Two small pyramids built for the wives of Pharoah
Pepi I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists
who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled Egypt
more than 2,000 years before Jesus was born.
   The discovery was announced Friday by members of the French
Archaeological Mission at Sakkara and scientists from Electricite
de France, the state-owned utility which conducted a high-tech
exploration at the site about 20 miles south of Cairo.
   The Sakkara site contains the step pyramid built by King Zoser,
said to be the first stone structure in history, and other
pyramids. The discovery of the queens' tombs brings to 85 the
number of known pyramids in Egypt.
   One pyramid is in ruins, but the second could contain
subterranean funeral chambers decorated with hieroglyphics, said
Jacques Montlucon, who led the utility's team.
   In the 19th century, the 50-acre Sakkara site served as a quarry
from which stone was taken for building in Cairo. For the last 25
years or so, extensive digging around the pyramid of Pepi I has
left a field of rubble at the site.
   ``It looks like a battlefield there,'' said Montlucon, adding
that the pyramids were covered by ``eight meters (about 26{ feet)
of rubbish.''
   ``In such disturbed land, it would be practically impossible to
find anything, to know where to begin to dig, without our current
technology,'' he said.
   Last summer Montlucon supervised the conservation of artifacts
retrieved from the wreck of the Titanic.
   He said the electromagnetic tests used at Sakkara were developed
by the French utility for conducting geophysical tests at potential
nuclear reactor sites.
   Using test results, the team put together a map pinpointing five
possible pyramid sites. Three sites were then excavated.
   The first hole revealed a highly decorated mastaba, or tomb, of
a dynastic official. Weeks passed before workers finally hit the
stone of a pyramid on Feb. 12.
   ``I was in the big pyramid when the foreman came running in
shouting `Mabrouk!' (congratulations),'' Montlucon said. ``I felt
so happy I could have cried.''
   Workers dug out a ``buttonhole'' through which they could see a
segment of the pyramid wall, smooth and gold in color. The French
archaeological team will ask permission from the Eygptian
Antiquities Organization to begin full excavation next year on the
pyramid, thought to be 66 feet tall and 66 feet at the base.
   The find is ``a big gain for Egyptology'' and ``will allow us to
know more, possibly a great deal more, about the 6th Dynasty'' that
ruled the Nile Valley from 2420 to 2258 B.C., Montlucon said.
   Archaeologists are hoping the pyramid contains hieroglyphic
inscriptions that can be added to the Pyramid Texts, the oldest
writings known to man. The archaeologists also hope the writing
will reveal the name of the pharaoh's wife, shrouded by the
centuries, who is buried there.

<HEAD>Mulroney Urges Congress To Curb Acid Rain If Reagan Won't</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Congress should act on its own to clean
up acid rain since the Reagan administration has refused to do so,
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Friday.
   In an interview with American reporters before an official visit
to Washington next week, Mulroney said:
   ``The United States would be pretty upset with me if I were
dumping my garbage in your backyard. Well, this is what's happening
except it's coming from above.''
   Canada claims that 50 percent of the acid rain damaging its
waterways and forests comes from U.S. smokestacks across the
border. For more than seven years, it has urged the United States
to legislate reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide.
   President Reagan, on advice from the Environmental Protection
Agency, says more research is needed before embarking on costly
clean-up measures.
   ``I don't accept his view at all,'' said Mulroney, who has built
otherwise close relations with his fellow conservative.
   ``When lakes and rivers and streams and forests are dying before
your eyes, you don't need a great deal of further research.''
   In Parliament Friday, opposition Liberal Party member Herb Gray
accused Reagan of believing acid rain is caused by ``ducks, birds
and trees'' and demanded that Mulroney present the United States
with a multimillion-dollar bill for damage to Canadian forests and
lakes.
   But Mulroney, interviewed in his office, said he favored the
civil approach. All nations have differences, he said. ``Do you
declare a war?''
   He said he had not given up on Reagan, but will use an
invitation to address both houses of Congress next Wednesday to
urge American legislators to act on their own.
   ``I'll accept an acid rain treaty irrespective of which end of
Pennsylvania Avenue initiates action,'' the prime minister said.
   He said many members of Congress support the fight against acid
rain, and he forecast that all three leading contenders for the
presidency, Republican Vice President George Bush and Democrats
Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, would be strong advocates for
the environment.
   But he added: ``I'm not pinning my hopes on any individual.''
   Canada reports 14,000 lifeless lakes and 19 barren salmon rivers
because of acid rain. It began its own cleanup in 1985, aimed at
reducing its sulfur emissions 50 percent by 1994. It wants the
United States to do the same.
   Mulroney said there will be a treaty eventually on cutting down
on cross-border acid rain, ``that is for certain. The only question
is when. It won't be tomorrow, but it's going to come _ sooner
rather than later.''
   He said Americans should care that they are ruining the
northeastern part of the continent and damaging relations with
their ``best friend, neighbor and ally, Canada.''
   Despite press speculation that he will call an election this
fall, a year before his five-year term expires, Mulroney said:
``I'm not even thinking about an election.''
   The 49-year-old leader of the Progressive Conservative Party
said his government has a full legislative program this year,
including ratification of the Free Trade Agreement with the United
States, a constitutional accord recognizing Quebec as a ``distinct
society,'' a day care program and the privatization of Air Canada.
   ``We've got a hell of a lot of business to do before I'm going
to start considering elections,'' he said.
   He forecast victory when he does call an election. The latest
polls indicate the three Canadian parties neck-and-neck and the
Conservatives on the rise.

   The United States and Canada will
continue to send aid to the impoverished island of Negros despite
threats by communist rebels to attack projects funded by the
countries, embassy officials said Friday.
   The army's chief of staff, meanwhile, ordered troops to hunt
down the Negros insurgents.
   ``Force them to surrender or die,'' Gen. Renato de Villa told
troops near Bacolod, Negros' largest city, about 300 miles
southeast of Manila.
   He spoke a few hours after three members of the leftist New
People's Army were killed by soldiers in the nearby town of
Candoni. On Thursday, rebels killed a policeman and an officer near
a Bacolod cemetery, police said.
   In Manila, spokesman Jerry Huchel said the U.S. Embassy was
taking the rebel threat seriously but ``we feel that our security
precautions are adequate.''
   Canadian Vice Consul Bruce Levy said the embassy was trying to
verify the reported warning, but so far ``we have no information
that we are a target.''
   The National Democratic Front branch on Negros said Thursday
that projects receiving U.S. and Canadian aid would be included on
its list of targets as it launches increased attacks on Negros.
   The front is the umbrella organization of communist rebels who
have been fighting the government for 19 years.
   The rebels said other targets included multinational companies,
military units and individuals considered ``enemies of the people.''
   The U.S. Embassy increased security and advised other Americans
to take extra precautions after rebels killed three Americans and a
Filipino in October near Clark Air Base north of Manila.
   Huchel said no U.S. personnel are based on Negros but American
aid officials periodically visit the island to look into the
progress of various projects.
   U.S. aid figures for Negros were unavailable, but Huchel said
U.S.-assisted projects on Negros ranged from food programs for
malnourished children to crop development, irrigation and health
care.
   Asked if the rebel threat would affect funding for the programs
or the periodic visits by American officials, Huchel replied, ``I
don't think so.''
   Levy said the threat would not affect the $8.9 million in
Canadian funding for 30 projects on Negros. The projects include
production of food and handicrafts.
   One Canadian officer is based on Negros but other officials make
periodic visits, Levy said.

<TEXT>
   A Greek fuel tanker carrying up
to 29 people broke apart after catching fire in the North Atlantic
and search units reported no sign of survivors Friday.
   Lt. Cmdr. Kent Fisher of the U.S. Coast Guard in New York said a
merchant vessel recovered the burned body of a man who had a Polish
passport and was carrying the ship's registry papers. The victim
was identified only as a 41-year-old man.
   Fisher said there had been 24 crew members and five women, the
wives of crewmen, aboard the 500-foot tanker Athenian Venture.
   The Greek-owned ship had an all-Polish crew, according to the
Coast Guard spokesman.
   ``The vessel apparently exploded and came apart,'' he said. The
bow section, about one-sixth of the ship's length, sank Friday
afternoon and the stern was still burning Friday night.
   Two long-range aircraft would continue patrolling the area where
the body was found in case there are survivors, Fisher said.
   The crippled tanker, which had not radioed any distress signals,
was first spotted just after midnight by the Canadian research ship
Hudson 370 miles southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland.
   The Hudson initially reported one of the tanker's lifeboats had
been launched and a Canadian coast guard spokesman said three
liferafts and a lifeboat were missing from the tanker, leading to
hope there might be survivors.
   But Fisher said later there were no indications anyone had lived.
   ``We can't take a great deal of stock in the meaning of that,''
Fisher said of the early report from the Hudson. ``Further
inspection from the Hudson indicates it (the lifeboat) may have
burned in the cradle. The loading gear was undisturbed.''
   The U.S. Coast Guard is coordinating the search.
   The Cypriot-registered tanker, owned by Patron Marine of Athens,
was headed for New York from Amsterdam with a load of gasoline,
according to Fisher.
   On Friday afternoon the stern of the 18,000-ton tanker was still
ablaze in rain squalls and winds exceeding 55 mph that whipped up
5-foot swells.
   Fisher said there was no indication of the cause of fire.
   He said the vessel was only identified by the Coast Guard
through contacts with companies known to have tankers in the area.
   Capt. Loran Strum of the Hudson said the tanker was burning
fiercely and had already broken in two by the time his ship
approached.
   ``We could see fire through the house windows so she's all
burned out in the bridge sector,'' Strum said in a ship-to-shore
radio interview. ``I think I could quite safely say it would be
impossible for anyone to be alive aboard.''
   ``We did get in under the bow to get a look,'' he said. ``The
paint is so blistered that there is no name _ there is not even a
vestige of a name visible.''
   Strum, a 37-year veteran of the sea, said a column of smoke from
the tanker's sterm could be seen for 30 miles.
   Participating in the search were two Canadian Aurora aircraft
from Greenwood, Nova Scotia, a U.S. Coast Guard C-130 Hercules from
North Carolina, the Hudson, the Canadian fisheries patrol boat Cape
Roger and an Italian-registered ship.
   In Ottawa, Trade Minister John Crosbie told the House of Commons
an oil slick was spotted but it posed no threat to Canadian fishing
grounds because ocean currents would carry the oil to the northeast
and farther out to sea.

   A Republican challenge to the
pro-Democratic reapportionment of California's congressional
districts in 1982 has been rejected by a federal court panel.
   In a decision made public Friday, the panel voted 2-1 to dismiss
a suit by Republicans that claimed the drawing of district
boundaries by the Democratic-controlled Legislature violated the
constitutional rights of GOP voters to equality in voting.
   The court said a partisan reapportionment is unconstitutional
only if one party is effectively ``shut out'' of the political
process. Republicans cannot make that claim in California, as they
hold the governor's office, a U.S. Senate seat, and 40 percent of
the House seats, the court said.
   ``California Republicans represent so potent a political force
that it is unnecessary for the judiciary to intervene,'' said the
opinion by Judge Cecil Poole of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   U.S. District Judge Alfonso Zirpoli joined his opinion. U.S.
District Judge Robert Schnacke said he would file a dissenting
opinion later.
   Lawyers for Republican officials and voters who filed the suit
in 1983 said they would appeal to the Supreme Court and hoped for a
ruling that would affect the 1990 congressional elections.
   Democrats have a 27-18 majority in the state's congressional
delegation. The district lines were drawn by the late Rep. Phil
Burton, a Democrat, approved by the Legislature, and signed by
Democratic Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.

   President Augusto Pinochet indicated
Friday that he would like to be the sole candidate in a
presidential plebiscite scheduled for later this year.
   Speaking before about 4,500 women, the 72-year-old president and
army commander said Chileans will be asked in the plebiscite to say
``whether they want President Pinochet to stay, or not.''
   Under a 1980 Constitution drafted by the military regime,
Chileans will vote in 1988 on whether to approve as president a
single candidate chosen by the military.
   Should a plurality vote yes, Pinochet will serve an eight-year
term starting on March 11, 1989. If most people vote no, an open,
competitive presidential election would be scheduled in 1990.
   It had been widely believed that Pinochet would be the sole
candidate, but Friday's speech at Vina del Mar, a sea resort 75
miles northwest of Santiago, marked the first time that he
indicated he was seeking re-election.
   Pinochet told the crowd Friday that the real question in the
plebiscite ``will be whether citizens want the government to
continue, or not. Whether they want President Pinochet to continue,
or not.''
   The women replied with a resounding ``Yes.''
   According to the constitution, the candidate in the plebiscite
will be chosen by the commanders of the army, the air force, the
navy and the national police. As army commander in chief, Pinochet
takes part in the nomination.
   Pinochet said the commanders will have ``to decide whether the
one who is the president now has done a good job, or a bad job.''
   ``It's up to them now to make a decision,'' he told the cheering
audience.
   The navy commander, Adm. Jose Toribio Merino, and the air force
chief, Gen. Fernando Matthei, have repeatedly stated that they
would prefer a civilian candidate. The have also said, however,
that should Pinochet resign his army command, he would become a
civilian.
   No date has been set for the ballot, but officials have hinted
it could take place on Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of the
military coup led by Pinochet that ousted elected President
Salvador Allende, a Marxist.
   In a statement issued at the end of a three-day closed meeting,
the nation's Roman Catholic bishops called Friday on military
leaders to pick a candidate and choose a date for the plebiscite
promptly.
   ``The sooner the date and the candidate are known, the more
transparent will be the process,'' the Chilean Episcopal Conference
said.
   The bishops also said they hoped the ballot would be ``secret,
free and informed,'' that the number of voters be
``representative'' and that there be a ``guarantee of
impartiality'' in the vote count.
   ``If these conditions are not met, the plebiscite will lack the
moral justness needed to sustain its validity,'' the bishops said.

   Jesse Jackson said it is too early to be ``giving out coronation
roses'' for front-runner Michael Dukakis as the Democrats held
their first one-on-one debate Friday and joked about choosing a
vice presidential nominee for the fall.
   ``I look forward to choosing a running mate; Mike looks forward
to chosing a running mate,'' Jackson said. ``But however it goes,
when it's all said and done and coming out of (the Democratic
national convention in) Atlanta, we will come out as a unit to send
the Reagan-Bush forces back to private life.''
   It was a good-natured, hour-long confrontation between the two
surviving Democrats five days before the Pennsylvania primary.
   There was little heated rhetoric in the debate and what existed
was directed at Vice President George Bush and the Reagan
administration, echoing the themes from the candidates' day of
campaigning across the state.
   Jackson did press Dukakis seriously on policy toward South
Africa, which Jackson said sponsored terrorism.
   ``I would be very tough on South Africa,'' the Massachusetts
governor replied.
   The No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket in the fall was a major
topic of the debate _ the first in the two-man end-game for the
nomination _ as it has been since Dukakis took a giant step toward
the presidential nomination with his New York victory on Tuesday.
   During the debate sponsored by the Pennsylvania Democratic
party, Jackson was asked if he wanted the vice presidential spot.
   ``It's a bit premature to be giving out coronation roses for the
governor and taps for me,'' Jackson said. ``We're now moving into
the last lap of a significant race, and I'm a long-distance runner.
I look forward to it.''
   Then Dukakis turned to Jackson and asked in a soft voice:
   ``Are you interested?''
   Jackson smiled and replied, ``You got it, Mike.''
   Later Dukakis was asked how he could win in the South in the
general election. Jackson added his analysis:
   ``Mike Dukakis on my ticket will win the South,'' provoking
laughter from the audience at the University of Pennsylvania campus
in Philadelphia.
   Asked if he believed polls saying Jackson as vice president
would hurt Dmeocratic chances in the fall, Dukakis gave a one-word
answer: ``No.''
   Jackson was late arriving for the debate, walking onto the stage
about three minutes after it began. He shook Dukakis' hand and then
the two held their clasped hands high, like prizefighters.
   Both men pleaded with voters to ignore the polls, which give
Dukakis a big lead in the state.
   ``People ought to vote conscience, courage and conviction. If
they do, they will vote for Jesse Jackson or, at least, they will
vote for their choice,'' Jackson said. ``I give you a choice. You
give me a chance. I will make you a good president.... When I win,
there are no more imnpossible American dreams.''
   During the debate, both men repeated the themes they used
campaigning Friday.
   Dukakis praised the trade bill moving through Congress, saying
it would be ``a tragedy'' if President Reagan vetoed the measure
over a provision requiring companies to give a 60-day notice before
shutting down a plant.
   ``A very modest, very mild, 60-day notice provision seems to me
to be just simple justice for workers and working families,''
Dukakis said while campaigning in Toledo, Ohio.
   Jackson turned his attention to Central America.
   ``Your generation must go beyond war in Latin America,'' he told
students at a rally at West Chester State University near
Philadelphia. ``We're not threatened by three million Sandinistas.
And, if so, we can't be saved by 15,000 Contras.''
   Dukakis aides said the Massachusetts governor was spending
$100,000 on television advertising in Pennsylvania in advance of
next Tuesday's primary, a relatively modest amount that reflects
his status as overwhelming favorite in the race.
   Bush, his nomination secure and his general election campaign
planning well under way, spent the day fishing in Florida.
   His aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, depicted the vice
president as being uncomfortable with embattled Attorney General
Edwin Meese III's refusal to resign. But Bush himself has not
called for Meese's resignation.
   The vice president attended a White House meeting on Wednesday
with President Reagan at which two departing Justice Department
officials said they thought Meese's presence was damaging the
department.
   In a full day of campaigning in advance of the debate, Dukakis
accused Bush of failing to understand what it takes to ``build an
economic future and to create good jobs.''
   Previewing a line of attack he is expected to use in the fall
campaign, the Massachusetts governor said, ``I don't see how we are
going to bring good jobs and good wages back to the industrial
Midwest unless we work together. If the vice president doesn't
understand that, then he shouldn't be running for president.''
   The Democratic front-runner also attacked the Republican
nominee-apparent for saying he wants to be ``the education
president.''
   ``How can he say that after the last seven years?'' Dukakis
asked a crowd of students at Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa.
``After seven years of an administration that has slammed a door in
the face of millions of youngsters looking for a chance to go to
college? After seven years of treating education ... as if it were
a privilege for the few, instead of a right and a necessity for
every American?''
   In his speech, Dukakis called for a national teaching excellence
fund and an education security fund to boost teachers and to make
more college loans available to students. He said his ideas would
cost an additional $250 million in federal spending.
   Dukakis had a full campaign day across Ohio and Pennsylvania,
seeking blue-collar votes in the nation's industrial heartland. The
Pennsylvania primary is next Tuesday, with Ohio and Indiana voting
on May 3.
   ``You're looking at someone who is a true-blue,
dyed-in-the-wool, full-employment Democrat,'' he told workers
outside a Ford plant in Maumee, Ohio.
   At the Ford plant and at a steel plant in Pittsburgh, Dukakis
emphasized his support for government working in partnership with
business and labor to save jobs.
   Asked by a reporter about a Bush statement that government must
stay out of the private sector, Dukakis replied at a Toledo airport
news conference:
   ``I don't think the vice president understands what it takes to
build an economic future and to create good jobs.''
   ``Government shouldn't do it all. I'm a strong believer in the
free enterprise system, but we need a president who will be a
strong partner ... who will help with some resources, some
support,'' he said. ``It's the public private partnerships that are
making the difference all over the country. That's what I've been
doing'' in Massachusetts.

   With the superpower summit only five weeks off,
Secretary of State George P. Shultz chipped away on arms control
problems and regional disputes with Soviet leaders Friday but
apparently made little headway.
   ``Maybe we're marking time,'' General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev declared.
   Shultz challenged the Soviet leader's assessment. ``From our
point of view, we're far from marking time,'' he told reporters at
the windup of two days of talks. But he said ``the going is hard''
in trying to conclude an arms treaty in time for President Reagan
and Gorbachev to sign at their May 29-June 2 summit meeting here.
   The official news agency Tass said that during the meeting,
Gorbachev attacked recent statements by President Reagan.
   The agency said Gorbachev told Shultz that despite a recent
warming in superpower relations, ``sermons are again being
delivered to us and we are being instructed on how we should behave
ourselves. Our foreign policy is being assessed only negatively
while the policy of the U.S. administration is assessed only
positively.''
   ``Morever, everything that has been achieved in Soviet-American
relations is being ascribed to the policy of strength and ``putting
pressure on the Soviets,''' the Soviet leader told Shultz,
according to the agency.
   ``We are not going to re-educate the United States and do not
recognize that it has any right to re-educate us,'' Gorbachev was
quoted as saying.
   The Soviet leader was apparently referring to a foreign policy
speech given by Reagan Thursday in Springfield, Mass. In it, the
president said that the United States and the Soviet Union cannot
have ``a normal relationship'' unless Moscow changes its ways and
stops interfering in nations such as Afghanistan.
   In a joint statement Friday, the U.S. and Soviet teams said
negotiators would deal with the disputed issues ``on a priority
basis.''
   They reaffirmed their ``strong commitment to make an intensive
effort'' to complete the treaty and said the summit ``should mark
another important step in the process of building a more stable and
constructive relationship.''
   Shultz was scheduled to leave Saturday to visit Kiev and
Tbilisi, stop in Brussels to brief the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization on Monday and then fly home.
   He will hold another session with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze before the Moscow summit, probably in Geneva around
May 10.
   ``It's pick and shovel work,'' Shultz said of the uphill effort
to complete the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, to crown
Reagan's fourth and probably final meeting with Gorbachev.
   At a news conference, Shevardnadze said he could not promise a
strategic arms treaty before Reagan's visit and he criticized any
attempt to rush negotiations.
   ``Soviet-American relations are not some kind of a lightning
chess match whose participants are making lightning moves and
feverishly hit the buttons of the time clock,'' the Soviet envoy
said. ``It is far more important for us to know that the clock of
our contacts have been now timed to achieve weighty, tangible and
stable positive results.''
   He suggested that without a treaty Gorbachev and Reagan could
still sign a document stating progress toward an accord.
   While U.S. arms negotiators offered a new proposal in a dispute
over air-launched cruise missiles, the treaty to sharply reduce
U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons was still stymied in a
dispute over ``Star Wars.''
   The U.S. proposal was to count as nuclear weapons all cruise
missiles carried by fighter planes even though some may be
conventionally armed. Both sides would have the right to develop
air-launched cruises that were not nuclear, and the weapons would
not be covered by the treaty.
   The idea is to bypass a dispute over verifying which of the
cruise missiles are long-range nuclear arms.
   The Soviets agreed to study the proposal, a senior U.S. official
said at a briefing for reporters under rules of anonymity.
   Another major stumbling block in completing the treaty is
finding ways to monitor U.S. and Soviet weapons to make sure
cutbacks are not circumvented.
   On the regional front, the Soviets again refused to heed
Shultz's appeal for the United Nations to declare an arms embargo
against Iran.
   Since the Soviets have veto power on the U.N. Security Council,
this means the United States is unable to move for U.N. sanctions
against Iran. The idea is to try to force compliance with a
cease-fire ordered by the council last July in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Shultz also could not persuade the Soviet Union to restore
diplomatic relations with Israel after a 21-year break or to pledge
to increase Jewish emigration, which hit a 15-month high of 984 in
March, another U.S. official said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church urged the
United States Friday to lift the economic sanctions it imposed on
Panama to oust strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, saying they
pose ``a threat to the life of our people.''
   The church said in an eight-page pastoral letter that the
sanctions ``have strongly hit all the people, above all the poorest
and the most humble.''
   ``We consider that ... they exceed any strategy of political
pressure and constitute by themselves a threat to the life of our
people,'' it said. ``They are, therefore, morally unjust. Because
of that, we demand that they be suspended immediately.
   ``In the same way, we reject all forms of military
intervention.''
   The sanctions block Panamanian government assets in the United
States; bar payments by all people and organizations in the United
States to the Noriega-controlled administration, and ban payments
to this administration by all U.S. citizens and organizations in
Panama, including U.S. branches and subsidiaries.
   The sanctions, combined with closures of the banks and a
two-week strike in March, have brought Panama's economy to a
virtual standstill.
   ``The lack of money in circulation is bringing misery and
desperation to thousands of Panamanians, and an exodus has started
of citizens to foreign countries that is beginning to have
worrisome dimensions,'' the hierarchy of the Catholic Church said
in its letter.
   ``Meanwhile, delinquency in our cities is increasing in an
alarming way,'' it said, adding that the crisis is turning Panama
into ``a sinister battle camp.''
   ``We cannot continue like this.''
   The letter was signed by Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath and the 10
bishops of this predominantly Roman Catholic nation. It asked the
government and its opposition to start bargaining as soon as
possible to arrange a solution to end the crisis.
   The church agreed at the end of March to mediate the dispute,
but suspended the effort a week later.
   Financial analysts said earlier Friday that the government was
seeking an international organization to process a backlog of
checks that have piled up since Panama's banks closed seven weeks
ago.
   Banking regulators have been rebuffed in previous attempts to
get European or Latin American banks to take over the clearinghouse
operation.
   A financial analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the officials wanted an international organization that would be
``beyond the scope of the United States.''
   ``The objective ... (is) to have the accounts with an
organization that has diplomatic privileges and immunities,'' he
said.
   Three ministers, including Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia,
meanwhile offered their resignations to Panama's civilian chief
executive, Manuel Solis Palma.
   A copy of Abadia's letter of resignation addressed to Solis
Palma was obtained by The Associated Press.
   Romulo Escobar Betancourt, president of the Democratic
Revolutionary Party of the governing coalition, identified the
other two men as Nander Pitty Velazquez, minister of the
presidency, and Candelario Santana, recently named to head the
Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
   The state-run newspaper Critica said Friday that Solis Palma was
expected to name a ``war Cabinet'' to confront the nation's
economic crisis.
   Noriega, head of the military and generally considered the real
ruler of the country, is under indictment in the United States on
federal drug trafficking charges. He denied the charges.
   Noriega touched off the crisis on Feb. 26 when he deposed
then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who tried to fire him a day
earlier.
   The action caused a run on Panama's banks by nervous depositors.
The government ordered the approximately 120 banks closed on March
3 after acknowledging it didn't have enough money to cover
withdrawals.
   Panama had an estimated $50 million on deposit in American
banks, but that money was frozen by lawsuits filed to stop the
Noriega-controlled government from withdrawing it.
   With little money, the National Bank of Panama has been unable
to conduct a clearing operation for thousands of checks.
   On Monday, the National Banking Commission, a regulatory agency,
allowed the banks to reopen but only to accept deposits. Customers
still cannot withdraw cash.

   An estimated 30 minority students
took over a dean's office at Williams College on Friday, the eve of
Parents' Weekend at the prestigious liberal arts school.
   A spokesman for the students who declined to identify himself
said in a telephone interview that black, Hispanic, Asian and
Polynesian students occupied Jenness House at 8:30 a.m. The only
member of the dean's staff in the building at the time, a
secretary, left at their request.
   ``We took this action to protest the administration's
unwillingness to address substantially fundamental issues relating
to minority concerns at the college,'' the group, called the
Coalition Against Racism Education, said in a statement.
   ``These issues relate to recruitment, hiring goals and policies
with regard to minority faculty, staff and students,'' the
statement said. ``They also relate to the broader issues of
minority representation in the curriculum.''
   Some 10 percent of the school's 278 faculty members and 13
percent of its 2,000 students are members of minority groups,
school spokesmen said.
   At a Friday evening news conference, Sean F. McPherson, who said
he was a senior from Hilo, Hawaii, and one of the protesters, said
his group had set up a formal meeting Sunday with college President
Francis C. Oakley. He said the outcome could determine whether the
building takeover continues.
   McPherson said the protesters had spoken by phone with with
administrators and were not asked to leave the building. He said
they were asked _ and agreed _ to keep away from confidential files.
   Witnesses said the protesters barricaded the doors and pulled
down the window shades in the Victorian house, which is serving as
a makeshift dean's office while the main administration building is
renovated.
   The occupiers also hung a banner reading, ``By any means
necessary _ We shall not be moved.''
   Shortly after noon, Dean of the College Stephen Fix issued a
statement saying college officials had met with the students to
discuss ``the important goals we share.''
   ``All of us in the college are prepared to continue such
discussions in any atmosphere that is conducive to the free and
open exchange of ideas,'' Fix said.
   College spokeswoman Ellen Berek said she did not know if any
meetings had been arranged, although Fix said he spoke to students
briefly through a window. As of late afternoon, things at the scene
were quiet, said Berek.
   The students have vowed to stay put until the college responds
to their demands, which are apparently the same concerns that many
of the same students sent to Oakley March 4.
   ``After receiving inadequate response, we decided this action
was necessary,'' a protester said.
   The protest came a day before the dedication of a baseball field
and track by George N. Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees
baseball team and an alumnus.
   Steinbrenner, whose son is a sophomore at the elite school, is
one of hundreds of alumni expected to return to the campus for the
parents' weekend.
   In addition to criticism of minority hiring and curriculum, the
protesters' spokesman said they were angry that a college advisory
committee recently voted against urging three pharmaceutical
companies in which the college owns stock to withdraw from South
Africa.
   Berek said the committee decided it was important for blacks in
South Africa to be able to buy the medicines the companies made.
   In February, minority students at the University of
Massachusetts and Hampshire College in Amherst, more than 40 miles
southeast of Williamstown, occupied buildings on their campuses for
several days to protest racial discrimination.
   Those protests ended after the heads of the schools signed
agreements to increase funding of minority projects and make other
concessions.
   Students at Wesleyan University in Middleton, Conn., continued
their sit-in at an administration building for a fifth day Friday
in a protest of the school's investments in South Africa.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Minister Liable For Attack On His Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Methodist minister Walker Railey is liable
for the near-fatal choking of his wife a year ago, a Dallas County
judge ruled Friday.
   Judge John Whittington made a default judgment against Walker
Railey in a civil lawsuit filed by Peggy Railey's mother, Billie Jo
Nicolai.
   Although he was served twice with the suit, Railey, 40, never
responded in court to the allegation he brutally attacked his wife.
   ``If you bring allegations against the defendant and you give
the defendant notice of the allegations and an opportunity to come
in and respond to those allegations, and he refuses to do that, the
court can hold the defendant liable and hold those allegations as
true,'' Bill Arnold, attorney for Mrs. Nicolai, said Friday.
   The decision was announced a year and a day after Mrs. Railey,
39, was found lying unconscious on her garage floor. She has been
in a coma since the attack.
   Railey, former senior minister at First United Methodist Church,
has claimed he was doing research at Southern Methodist University
on the night of the attack.
   The suit asks for unspecified damages for Mrs. Railey and her
family. The Railey's two children are living with family friends in
Dallas.
   Arnold said a jury trial will be scheduled to decide the amount
of damages, probably this summer. He said he plans to subpoena
Railey for the trial and seek a warrant for his arrest.
   William Nicolai, Mrs. Railey's father, declined comment when
reached by telephone Friday.
   Railey's attorney Doug Mulder was not in his office or at home
when phoned for comment.
   After a suicide attempt following the attack, Railey refused to
talk with police or answer questions before a grand jury. No
criminal charges have been filed, although Mulder has said Railey
is the only suspect.
   Railey surrendered his minister's credentials and moved to San
Francisco, where he rented an apartment with Lucy Papillon. Ms.
Papillon, a psychologist, told a grand jury she had been seeing
Railey and they had discussed marriage before the attack on his
wife.
   Railey and Ms. Papillon broke their lease on their apartment
about two weeks ago, the landlord said earlier this week. Officials
say they believe Railey is in the Los Angeles area. There was no
telephone listing for Railey in the area.

   The heart of an unidentified man
found unconscious on a sidewalk was transplanted after he died,
causing debate Friday among medical ethicists, one of whom called
the procedure ``incredible.''
   ``It seems to me this does not sit well with the way we've been
doing things,'' said Michael Shapiro, an ethics professor at the
University of Southern California law center.
   The heart transplant was the first at Hoag Medical Center, 40
miles southeast of Los Angeles. The recipient was Dr. Norton
Humphreys, 58, of Fountain Valley, a former staff doctor who was
suffering from degenerative heart disease and suffered two heart
attacks in the past nine months.
   He was awake, alert and in good condition Friday, said hospital
spokeswoman Gail Love.
   The donor was an unidentified man believed to be a 20-year-old
Costa Mesa resident who was found unconscious in front of a
convenience store, hospital officials said.
   Police recovered from the man a temporary work card issued by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and were checking the
identity of the man pictured on the card, said police Lt. Rick
Johnson.
   ``To take vital organs out of someone who is not identified is
really incredible,'' said George Annas, a law and ethics professor
at Boston University's Medical School. ``If other people have done
it, they haven't talked about it in the newspaper, that's for
sure.''
   ``It seems to me that that is a variation from practice in this
country where someone generally has to agree to the donation,''
Shapiro said.
   The man was declared brain dead Tuesday after he was brought
into the hospital's emergency room, said Dr. Aldan Raney, one of
the cardiac surgeons who performed the transplant. The donor also
had traces of alcohol and cocaine in his urine, hospital officials
said.
   They said doctors followed guidelines established in
California's Uniform Anatomical Gift Act that require a 24-hour
police search for identification and relatives and questioning of
visitors to the donor. The man had no visitors.
   Raney and Dr. Douglas Zusman, the surgeons that performed the
transplant, have performed more than 77 heart transplants between
them.
   Annas said the hospital should have let at least 24 hours,
rather than six, lapse between the time the donor was declared dead
and the time the transplant began.
   But John Robertson, an ethics professor at the University of

   The top investigator for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission told Congress on Thursday that the Tennessee
Valley Authority's nuclear manager ``knowingly and willfully''
misrepresented safety conditions at a TVA plant.
   Disclosing publicly the conclusions of an investigation which
was referred to the Justice Department months ago, Ben B. Hayes,
director of the NRC Office of Investigations, testified that he
believed that Steven White, the TVA's nuclear chief, deliberately
misled the NRC.
   White has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
   The issue concerns a March 20, 1986 letter written by White in
which he assured the regulatory agency that there were no
``pervasive'' quality assurance problems at the still-unlicensed
Watts Bar nuclear plant at Spring City, Tenn.
   Hayes also questioned a subsequent White letter in which the TVA
manager told the commission that an independent review group had
found no serious problems at the plant after a thorough study.
   In fact, said Hayes, several of the men cited by White as
participants of that group told investigators that they ``hadn't
reviewed the matter, nor did they discuss it with Mr. White.''
Others signed off on a short memo about Watts Bar, but filed no
longer report.
   TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon defended White in a statement
released late Thursday, saying, ``The TVA board has complete
confidence in ... White. The board fully supports his managment of
TVA's nuclear recovery program.... We believe it is important to
note that there has been disagreement among the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission staff itself over whether Steven White misled the NRC.''
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized the NRC
for recently approving the restart of another TVA nuclear plant,
Sequoyah, while ``there were unresolved questions concerning the
integrity and believability of the TVA nuclear managers.''
   But NRC Chairman Lando Zech said ``the commission concluded that
immediate regulatory action prior to restart of Sequoyah was not
necessary as a result of the (Hayes) investigation. This limited
conclusion does not mean that there is no regulatory action
anticipated as a result of the findings.''
   The Justice Department has declined any comment on the status of
the White case since Hayes referred it last October. But an NRC
review group, headed by Assistant Director of Operations James
Taylor, disagreed with Hayes' conclusion that White's misstatements
were deliberate.
   Hayes testified that White was deliberately playing word games,
based on consultations with aides and his personal attorney, when
he said there were no ``pervasive'' breakdowns at Watts Bar. White,
said Hayes, apparently was relying on a definition of pervasive as
``100 per cent.''
   While it was technically correct that the plant didn't violate
all quality assurance standards, it did have serious and widespread
problems, according to the NRC.
   Hayes said White's letters amount to ``material false
statements,'' but the Taylor group concluded that while they may
have been off base, they did not violate the law.
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., defended White, who was brought in to
salvage the TVA's long-plagued nuclear operation. He said White is
``caught in the spider's web of confusion and misunderstanding.''

   A session with General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ended two days of talks for Secretary of State George P.
Shultz with little noticeable headway toward a history-making
summit meeting at the end of May.
   American officials have virtually abandoned hopes of completing
a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles by May 29, the date
for the Moscow summit.
   On the regional front, there was little superpower cooperation.
Despite another appeal by Shultz, the Soviets still declined to
support an international arms embargo against Iran, which delays
any action by the U.N. Security Council.
   And a U.S. official told reporters Thursday that a newly
submitted Soviet draft on space defense conforms to a tough Soviet
line that could make weapons cutbacks impossible.
   President Reagan hoped to sign a treaty at the May 29-June 2
summit meeting to reduce arsenals of long-range bombers, missiles
and submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent.

   A federal judge dismissed some claims

   Cancer patients who got morphine at the touch of
a button to relieve pain stopped using the drug sooner, and used
little more than half the narcotic than patients who got a
continuous infusion, a researcher says.
   ``These patients don't even come close to developing
addiction,'' said C. Richard Chapman, associate research director
at the Pain Center of the University of Washington and director of
the pain and toxicity research program at the Fred Hutchinson

<HEAD>Research Society Helps Bring Sex Out of China's Closet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARBIN, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sex is coming out of the closet in China
with the help of a group of sociologists and medical personnel who
want the Chinese to have happy, healthy sex lives.
   ``We are very unconservative,'' said Shi Ling, director of the
Obstetricl and Gynecological Hospital of Harbin and a member of
China's only Sex Science Research Society.
   The 177-member society was set up here last year to coordinate
efforts of medical workers and sociologists at several Harbin
hospitals and institutions in addressing sexual problems.
   Harbin, with its Soviet-style architecture and heavy industry in
northeastern China, seems an unlikely place for sex research and
the study and treatment of sexual disorders.
   But the city of 2 million has the nation's first centers for
treatment of male and female sexual disorders and the unique Sex
Science Research Society.
   Members of the society say China can no longer ignore the sexual
problems that many Chinese live with.
   ``Sex has long been a forbidden subject,'' said sociologist Gao
Caiqin, chairwoman of the Institute of Marriage and Family
Planning. ``No one was willing to talk about sex or sex problems,
but it is a very important problem.''
   ``No other disorder in the world is like sexual disorder in that
it affects both partners,'' said Li Jiqi, head of the Center for
Treatment and Consultations of Sexual Disorders of Men.
   ``Sooner or later, we had to establish this clinic,'' said Yang
Jin, director of the No. 4 Hospital, which houses the male clinic.
``We can't avoid this issue. It's a part of us, but in the past,
nobody was willing to talk about it.''
   He said the clinic has received 4,000 letters since it opened
two years ago and has a year-long waiting list for treatment.
   Similar clinics have been started since in other parts of the
country, but Harbin is regarded as the leader in the field.
   The male sexual disorders clinic has treated more than 3,000
patients, and the Center for Treatment and Consultations of Sexual
Disorders of Women, at the Obstetrical and Gynecological Hospital,
has handled 5,000 cases, of which 3,000 were outpatients.
   The open attitudes of the research society members are in sharp
contrast to those of a traditionally puritanical and moralistic
China.
   The female sexual disorders center, for example, encourages
women to experience orgasms during intercourse.
   Some problems the clinics handle are unique to China.
   With the gradual rise in the standard of living, young people
are reaching puberty earlier. The age at which girls begin to
menstruate has dropped from 13 years to 11, and boys reach puberty
at age 13 rather than 15.
   However, China has a strict policy of late marriage. The legal
age for marriage is 20 for women and 22 for men, the highest in the
world. While late marriage helps keep China's birth rate down, it
creates a nation of sexually frustrated young people.
   The clinics offer them help.
   Members of the research society acknowledged that they have
treated homosexuals and sufferers of venereal diseases, two
problems that Chinese officials had previously claimed no longer
existed in the country.
   ``We do have homosexuals,'' Li said. He added that the clinic's
surveys indicate three of every 1,000 men in China is homosexual.
   No figures were available on lesbians in China, but Shi Ling of
the Obstetrical and Gynecological Hospital said their numbers are
few and the female sexual disorders clinic has not treated any.
   The Chinese regard homosexuality as abnormal.
   The ``cure'' used by the male sexual disorders clinic is to
condition the homosexual not to be excited by men. It either
applies electric shocks or gives traditional Chinese medicine that
induces vomiting.
   Another problem dealt with by the society members is a growing
number of young people engaging in premarital sex.
   ``There is an obvious increase from the past of having sex
before marriage,'' Shi said.
   She added that no complete figures were available but her
hospital has seen an increase in the number of unmarried pregnant
women, ranging in age from 14 to 25. Seventy percent to 75 percent
of the abortions the hospital performs on women in their second
trimester of pregnancy are on unwed mothers, Shi said.
   The incidences of premarital sex in China, however, still falls
far below world levels, Shi said. Results of surveys of engaged
couples have shown that more than 90 percent were still virgins.
   The society members say they fight a battle on two fronts:
against what they call the ignorance and superstitions of
traditional thinking and the sexual freedoms of Western society.
   ``We don't talk about creativity in sex life,'' said Ma Ran,
deputy director the No. 4 Hospital and secretary-general of the
research society. ``We advise them how to have a healthy sex life.''
   Society members insist, however, that their ultimate goal is to
help people adjust sexually so that they can contribute to China's
socialist modernization.

<TEXT>
   KATUTURA, South-West Africa (AP) _ Hilda Shifidi, an unwed
mother of five who washes floors in a hospital for blacks, wants to
bring her father's killers to justice. To do that, she is taking
South Africa's president to court.
   ``I am not afraid of him,'' she said. ``He did something wrong.''
   President P.W. Botha halted the prosecution of six soldiers
charged with killing her father, the 56-year-old political activist
Immanuel Shifidi.
   Ms. Shifidi, who says her $100 monthly salary barely pays the
rent and utilities for her cramped four-room house, is the lone
applicant in legal papers challenging Botha's order.
   But she was not the only one upset when Botha blocked the trial
in March of four white officers and two black enlisted men. Across
South Africa and South-West Africa, the territory commonly known as
Namibia, the order brought an outcry from legal experts and liberal
politicians.
   Namibia's attorney general had accused the six soldiers of
arranging for 54 black soldiers to dress in civilian clothes, arm
themselves with knives and clubs, and ride by bus from a faraway
army base to disrupt an opposition political rally in Katutura, a
black township outside Windhoek, the territorial capital.
   Shifidi, one of about 2,000 people at the legal outdoor rally,
was fatally stabbed Nov. 30, 1986.
   Botha's critics accused him of hypocrisy for intervening in this
case just a few days after saying he should not interfere in the
case of the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a group of South African blacks
sentenced to hang for complicity in a mob killing.
   Botha rejected worldwide appeals for clemency for the
Sharpeville defendants, whose execution has been stayed while they
seek a new trial.
   In the Shifidi case, Botha invoked a section of South Africa's
Defense Act, which empowers him to grant immunity to any soldier
for any action committed ``in good faith ... in connection with the
prevention or suppression of terrorism in any operational area.''
   ``The law is intended to protect soldiers who do wrong,''
claimed Ms. Shifidi's lawyer, Hartmut Ruppel, at his office in
Windhoek
   Ms. Shifidi's application, filed in the territorial Supreme
Court on March 30, seeks to invalidate Botha's order so that the
murder trial can proceed. No date has been set for a hearing, and
the South African government has not indicated what steps it will
take to oppose the application.
   Ms. Shifidi, who wore a ``Workers Unite'' T-shirt during an
interview at her Katutura home, said repeatedly that ``there is no
justice'' under South African rule, but she expressed hope her
application would succeed.
   Speaking in the language of her Ovambo tribe, with a friend
translating, Ms. Shifidi, 35, said the accused soldiers ``must face
the court and accept whatever sentence the court hands down.''
   Her father was a founding member of the South-West African
People's Organization (SWAPO), an independence movement that has
been waging a guerrilla war against South African rule for 22
years. He served 18 years in prison for SWAPO activities, then
lived with his daughter in Katutura for two years before his death.
   SWAPO's political wing is legal, and the organization sponsored
the rally at which Shifidi was killed. His daughter also was at the
rally but was not nearby when he was stabbed.
   Under territorial laws, SWAPO is permitted to function as a
political organization, although the activities of its guerrilla
wing are outlawed.
   Ruppel said there is no evidence Shifidi was a pre-selected
target for assassination. Rather, the lawyer added, it appeared
that army officers sought to discredit SWAPO and intimidate its
supporters by provoking violence at its rally.
   The application filed by Ms. Shifidi contends Botha had no basis
for concluding that the six soldiers acted in good faith for the
purpose of combatting terrorism.
   Botha ``failed to apply his mind to the facts ... or acted in
bad faith, or grossly unreasonably,'' the application says.
   The application also questions whether the Katutura soccer field
where the rally took place, now called Shifidi Square, could be
accurately described as part of the army's operational area. But
Ruppel said he expected the government to contend that the
operational area extends to wherever soldiers are on duty.
   ``It moves as quickly as you can move soldiers,'' he said.
   The section of the Defense Act invoked by Botha says the
president can act only if he deems that continuation of the court
proceedings would harm ``the national interest.''
   Two previous trials in Namibia have been stopped by Botha under
terms of the Defense Act, Ruppel said. In each case, he added,
challenges were filed; one was rejected and the other is pending.
   Ruppel said it was possible that if South African authorities
lose to Ms. Shifidi in Windhoek Supreme Court, they would appeal to
an appellate court in South Africa.

   Each day Indian newspapers recount the
latest killings by Sikh radicals in the province of Punjab in
northern India.
   But 700 miles to the south, a Sikh general heads the Indian
army's southern command; imposing Sikh doormen usher guests into
plush hotels in New Delhi; Sikh drivers in turbans steer taxicabs
through Bombay's chaotic traffic.
   A Sikh owns one of India's largest bottling plants.
   Maninder Singh, a Sikh cricket player, is one of India's sports
stars.
   Known for their beards, turbans and, lately, the brutal campaign
for a separate Sikh nation in Punjab, Sikhs are an integral part of
India and have been since long before the country's independence
from Britain in 1947.
   ``More than half the people hanged by the British in the freedom
movement were Sikhs,'' said Kushwant Singh, a journalist and writer
known for his novels about Indian independence and a scholarly
history of his own Sikh people.
   Sikhs are a mere 2 percent of India's 800 million people and
most live in Punjab, a rich farming state on the Pakistan border.
It is there that radicals have killed more than 770 people this
year in their demand for an independent Sikh nation.
   But perhaps 4 million other Sikhs are scattered around the rest
of India. They have a reputation for being aggressive and
hardworking, and many have achieved success.
   In a survey of Sikhs outside Punjab, the Statesman newspaper
found them running factories in Uttar Pradesh state in the north,
trading in cloth in Bihar in the east, and active in the Lions Club
in Kerala, the southernmost Indian state.
   In Bombay, India's business capital, Sikhs have almost a
monopoly in the auto parts trade, and perhaps 10,000 Sikh taxi
drivers ply the city's streets.
   In much of India, in fact, the Sikhs own or drive many of the
cabs, buses and trucks, making them familiar to tourists. In New
Delhi, the military-looking doormen at five-star hotels are often
Sikhs, chosen for their height, which is accentuated by the turban.
   With the martial tradition of their religion, Sikhs also have
made their way in the army. During World War I, when Indian
soldiers served in the British army, 14 of the 22 British military
crosses warded to Indians went to Sikhs.
   Sikhs still make up 10 percent of India's army and even more
among the officer corps.
   In contrast to its later military role, Sikhism began as a
pacifist faith in 15th-century India, founded by a Hindu in
reaction to the bloody rivalries of Hindus and Moslems.
   The founder, Guru Nanak, rejected Hinduism's caste system but
kept many of its rituals, combining them with Islam's belief in a
single deity.
   Inevitably, though, the Sikh faith was drawn into the clash of
Hindus and Moslems. After the Moguls beheaded the ninth Sikh
prophet _ a defender of Hindus _ his son, Guru Gobind Singh, turned
the Sikhs to a warrior path in 1699.
   The son decreed that all Sikh men carry a knife, be soldiers of
the faith and use the name Singh, which means ``lion.''
   Gobind Singh also gave the Sikhs their distinctive look by
ruling they must never shave or cut their hair, which is worn
wrapped under the turban.
   Later, it was an Indian tradition for one son in a Hindu family
to be reared a Sikh, to act as a defender of both religions.
   The Sikh radical campaign in Punjab, however, has strained the
bond between the two religions. After Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in 1984, rioting in
northern India killed 3,000 people, most of them Sikhs.
   Even today, Sikhs outside Punjab say they are made to feel
separate by India's dominant Hindus, who are 80 percent of the
country's people.
   ``The Sikh is regarded with suspicion,'' said Kushwant Singh,
who noted that Sikhs complain of especially stringent security
checks at airports and that Sikh taxi drivers have more serious
problems at police checkpoints.
   Pratap Singh, who runs a New Delhi taxi stand, said five of his
six Sikh drivers have cut their hair and shaved to avoid being
associated with the radicals in Punjab.
   ``It means a special check the moment the driver is a Sikh. They
stop us, make us open the boot (car trunk), want to know what's in
the passengers' luggage. It's not our right to ask the passengers
what they carry.''
   Pratap Singh, whose own house was set ablaze during the 1984
anti-Sikh riots, wore a bright red turban during an interview at
his taxi stand.
   ``As long as the Punjab problem goes on, the problem here is not
going to be solved,'' he said.
   Kushwant Singh, the writer, said Sikhs outside Punjab are the
sharpest critics of the separatist concept because they are most
hurt by it.
   ``They're developing a feeling of being held as hostages. They
bear the brunt of the Hindu backlash when it comes.''
   He also said Sikhs elsewhere in India often have no connection
with Punjab. Many, he added, fled from Moslem Pakistan to various
parts of India when the two countries were divided at independence
from Britain in 1947.
   The Statesman newspaper also found that most Sikhs outside
Punjab oppose a separate Sikh state because they have built lives
elsewhere. Some have taken up the Telegu language of Andhra Pradesh
or Malayalam in Kerala in place of the Punjabi tongue.
   Kushwant Singh said, however, that opposition to a separate
Khalistan, the radicals' name for their would-be country, did not
mean the Sikhs approved of the government's handling of the Punjab
situation.
   He said Sikhs everywhere were disappointed in the government's
failure to foster industry in Punjab and were hurt by its refusal
to prosecute Hindu agitators blamed for starting the 1984 riots.
   Asked if the violence in Punjab and the reaction to it made
Sikh's feel less Indian, he responded: ``I feel the Indian
government isn't Indian enough.''

<HEAD>Art Malik Turns To Whodunits In PBS ``Black Tower''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans loved ``The Jewel in the Crown,'' the TV
epic that made Art Malik famous, and if the Pakistan-born actor is
right about his upcoming series, Americans will also warm to ``The
Black Tower.''
   ``If you're an Anglophile living in America, you're going to
love it,'' the 35-year-old actor said of the six-part thriller,
which starts April 28 on PBS stations. ``It projects a very
countrified, rarefied atmosphere.''
   The fourth miniseries to be adapted from a P.D. James thriller,
the show brings Roy Marsden back to the screen as Chief Inspector
Adam Dalgliesh, who this time is investigating a series of murders
at a private nursing home, Toynton Grange, in the English
countryside.
   Malik plays the elegantly dressed Julius Court, Toynton Grange's
principal benefactor and a man whose motives may not be what they
seem.
   The actor said the mystery genre attracted him to the project:
``I have to admit I do like whodunits, and Roy Marsden is an actor
I had wanted to work with for a long time.''
   But he said he would have altered the tone of the show.
   ``I don't think they make Dalgliesh angry enough,'' he said in
an interview. ``They don't want it dirty; they don't want Dalgliesh
to be down market. It is a very relaxed piece of TV.''
   It's also a distinct contrast, both in subject matter and style,
from the show to which he owes his success. As Hari Kumar, the
British-reared Indian wrongly charged with rape in ``The Jewel in
the Crown,'' Malik impressed critics with his stirring portrait of
a man caught in an affair he knows must end tragically.
   ``I was lucky enough to be launched into the marketplace with
the blessing of a series like `Jewel,''' the actor recalled of the
show, which also brought such actors as Tim Pigott-Smith, Geraldine
James and Charles Dance to world attention.
   ``In essence, it allows you to be seen as a serious actor on
television, and those opportunities are rare.''
   He spoke less flatteringly of some of his other credits, such as
the ABC TV-movie ``Harem,'' which aired in February 1986 in the
United States.
   ``The less said of that the better,'' Malik said of the
four-hour show starring Omar Sharif and Ava Gardner in which he was
cast as a Turkish rebel. ``The disaster of the whole piece was
nobody could decide whether to be tongue-in-cheek or serious.''
   However, he said Americans had no exclusive hold on mediocre
television.
   ``We have crap TV over here, as well; we have lousy movies as
well,'' Malik said. ```Jewel' comes out, and then there's a
hiatus.''
   He expressed high hopes for his upcoming project _ an ABC drama
series tentatively called ``The Clinic,'' co-starring Josef Sommer,
Michael Learned, and Alexis Smith and written by Jay Presson Allen.
   ``I have a lot of time for Jay. She's a lady with a lot of
integrity,'' Malik said of Allen, a prolific and much admired
writer who has created numerous works including the stage play and
film, ``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.''
   Malik portrays Ved Lahari, an India-born, England-educated
psychiatrist who lives in Boston. The series is scheduled to debut
in the summer.
   The actor, who lives in London's suburban Surrey with his wife,
actress Gina Rowe, and two daughters, said he looks forward to the
day when he is considered for all parts regardless of skin color.
Two of his more prominent roles were as Indians in ``The Far
Pavilions'' and ``A Passage to India.''
   ``Every actor is a minority of one, whether he be fat, thin,
Chinese, a woman,'' Malik said. ``I don't want to be seen as that.
I'm a working actor. I want to be the modern-day Anglo-Asian.''

<HEAD>`Born in East L.A.' To Open in Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The irreverent Cheech Marin, whose comic
``Born in East L.A.'' movie is about to open here, isn't worried
that Mexicans might not get the joke.
   ``It feels real good,'' he said. ``I think this is the place
where it will be the biggest hit of all the Latin American
countries, including Los Angeles.
   ``I expect people will see it and identify with it. I expect
they will laugh a lot, and be moved a lot.''
   The idea started as a song parody of Bruce Springsteen's ``Born
in the U.S.A.'' monster hit, then grew into a popular video before
becoming the movie written by, directed by and starring Marin.
   ``I couldn't afford to pay anyone else,'' he joked.
   The story is of a third-generation Mexican-American caught up in
an immigration dragnet and deported to Mexico where, Marin says, he
is ``a fish out of water'' who must sneak back across the border.
Much of the movie was filmed in Tijuana, Mexico's northwestern city
on the border with California.
   ``Born in East L.A.'' earned generally good reviews and decent
box office results in its release last year in the United States.
   Perhaps more important as far as Marin is concerned, it
established his reputation for working alone, without longtime
partner Tommy Chong in the Cheech and Chong comic duo.
   Asked if the split is definite, Marin replied: ``Only for the
next 150 years.''
   The movie will be released in Mexican theaters in the second
half of May, under the Spanish title ``Un Picaro de Los Angeles,''
or ``A Rascal From Los Angeles.'' The subtitle is ``The Craziest of
Them All.''
   Just as the character in his movie, Marin is a third-generation
Mexican-American. He has learned Spanish in the past few years in
his travels but still has an interpreter standing by for his
appearances here.
   ``At least I don't say, `I used to want a beer right now,''' he
said of his progress. ``I like it; it's a beautiful language.''
   He said there is nothing derogatory at all about Mexico or about
the immigration problem in the movie.
   ``You realize the sadness within the situation,'' he said in an
interview. ``I didn't come to Tijuana to make fun of people.
   ``It's more learning about the people who cross the border. I
wanted to humanize the whole story _ so they're not just numbers.
The United States needs the labor, but they persecute the people.
It's unjust.''
   Mexicans have a notoriously thin-skinned view of foreign humor
about them, and that easily could be true for jokes coming from
Mexican-Americans as well.
   Marin said the only screening so far in Mexico was at a
Guadalajara festival, and it went over well.
   He also said the movie was a hit at the Latin American film
festival in Havana late last year and has been shown as well in
Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and parts of Central America.
   ``So if it's not a big hit in Mexico, there's something wrong
with Mexico,'' he said with a big laugh.
   The movie was released at about the same time as the huge
success of Luis Valdez's ``La Bamba'' brought attention to the
Hispanic market in the United States. ``Stand and Deliver,'' the
new movie starring Edward James Olmos about a mathematics teacher
in a largely Mexican-American Los Angeles high school, also is a
smash.
   ``They're hits, and there will be more,'' Marin said. ``It's
time _ all the people have put in their dues.''
   When ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' is mentioned, however, he
replied: ``I don't really consider that Hispanic ... unless Robert
Redford had Mexican parents we don't know about it.''
   Cheech and Chong built much of their career on drug humor, but
Marin says that topic is behind him.
   ``We were only allotted 10,000 drug jokes _ and they were
gone,'' he said.
   He also said the innocent era has passed as well, comparing the
old jokes about three hippies passing a joint to the modern reality
of a 14-year-old selling crack, armed with a Uzi.
   Marin said about two years ago he split with Chong, got a
divorce and found himself deeply in debt.
   ``So I hit the typewriter,'' he said. ``That's always been my
salvation.''

<HEAD>Although Controverial, Beauty Pageants are a New Rage in Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banned for 23 years as an extravagance,
beauty pageants are suddenly the rage in Taiwan despite protests
from feminists and old-guard conservatives.
   The government lifted the ban in October and the country's
calendar already is crammed with two national and two international
beauty contests, culminating with the glitzy 1988 Miss Universe
Pageant on May 24 in Taipei.
   Most Taiwanese appear to favor the government's decision to end
the ban; one high school went so far as to hold its own pageant to
select teen-age students to compete in the 1988 Miss Republic of
China competition April 16.
   Others are less enthusiastic, however. A small group of retired
soldiers, arguing that only one's mother can be considered the most
beautiful woman, have threatened to set themselves ablaze at the
Miss Universe contest unless authorities reimpose the ban.
   ``We know beauty pageants are controversial, but we also know
most people enjoy a diversified life that includes such pageants,''
said Tsai Han-hsien, an Interior Ministry official who supervises
the contests.
   But Tseng Hsu-pai, a 93-year-old adviser to President Lee
Teng-hui, wants the pageants banned once again on grounds that they
are ``luring women into abandoning work and study for the pursuit
of fame and money.''
   Beauty contests were banned in 1964 by a government that found
them an unneeded extravagance when Taiwan wasn't as wealthy as it
is now.
   Early pageants were derided as indulgences by top officials who
were closely tied to the contestants. For example, the 1961 winner,
Wang Li-ling, was married to the son of Taiwan's governor at the
time, Chou Chi-jou.
   Prudishness also may have been a factor in the ban. According to
an Interior Ministry document, leading military officials thought
the winner of an early Miss China pageant became a strip dancer in
Las Vegas and urged then-President Chiang Kai-shek to ban further
contests.
   But with onset of prosperity, public opinion surveys indicate
that most Taiwanese welcome the return of beauty contests and hope
the two international pageants to be held in Taipei _ Miss Universe
and Miss Wonderland on April 29 _ will help the island win new
friends.
   Nearly 1,000 women overwhelmed two local pageants leading to the
international contests, but not without controversy.
   After a televised preliminary round to chose Taiwan's
representative for the Miss Wonderland contest, several people
telephoned to complain of contestants wearing swimsuits with
plunging necklines.
   About 25 feminists demonstrated outside the hotel where the
finals were held April 1, and they hoisted signs that read: ``Women
are not commercial products.'' The group argued that pageants judge
women by their figures and not by traditional standards of Chinese
beauty, such as intelligence and elegance.
   Four retired soldiers also showed up outside the hotel to
distribute anti-pageant fliers.
   ``Beauty contests are insults to mothers,'' said one, Hsu
Cheng-chien. ``Nobody in the world is more beautiful than one's
mother.''
   Hsu told reporters he and 10 other veterans will immolate
themselves if the government does not ban the pageants.
   The second national contest was held April 16 to select Taiwan's
contestants for the Miss Universe, Miss International and Miss
World pageants.
   Two contestants dropped out because their parents thought it
shameful to wear swimsuits in public.
   One of the three winners, 18-year-old Wu Yi-ning, was sent to
the pageant with four classmates by the Chuang Ching High School's
Board of Directors and faculty. The school held its own beauty
contest to select them and then provided wardrobes and intensive
model training.
   Miss Wu told a news conference after winning that she would
leave school for a year to meet her responsibilities as a winner.
   Despite the controversies, pageant organizer Shieh Tung-min
maintains that Taiwan ``cannot ignore that pageants will help
foreign countries better understand the prosperity and success of
our country.''
   Not so, responded Huang Kuang-kuo, professor of psychology at
the National Taiwan University, who is quick to say pageants are
not the apex of cultural activity.
   ``The world may get to know Taiwan's name from pageants, but
pageants have nothing to do with raising the nation's profile,'' he
said.

   ``The case of Tawana Brawley has become a festering social
wound.''
   _ The New York Times in a March 15 editorial.

<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WAPPINGERS FALLS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What really happened to Tawana
Brawley?
   Her advisers have promised she'll spill all by week's end,
either to a federal prosecutor of their liking or to reporters.
   ``The story will be told,'' vowed the Rev. Al Sharpton, the
Brooklyn minister who appointed himself Brawley's protector and
keeper of her silence.
   ``The public will not see this end without ever knowing Tawana's
story. We owe that to the people who have supported her,'' Sharpton
said in an interview.
   Only scattered pieces of an unsolved puzzle have emerged in the
five months since the former cheerleader stepped off a bus into the
evening shadows and what she said was an abduction punctuated by
sexual and racial abuse.
   Brawley, then 15, was found dazed and wriggling in a garbage bag
outside her old apartment Nov. 28, four days after she disappeared.
Her hair was chopped, her skin smeared with dog feces, and the
words ``nigger'' and ``KKK'' were scrawled on her torso.
   According to relatives and her sketchy accounts to police, she
was raped, sodomized and abused by three to six white men, one of
whom she alleged was a policeman with blond hair and a mustache.
Hospital tests, however, showed no signs of sexual abuse.
   Brawley's refusal to tell her story to a state grand jury has
brought suspicion, innuendo, doubt, gossip, questions about a cop's
suicide and the sizzle of racial tension to this working class
village in the Hudson River Valley.
   Bewildered investigators, handcuffed by Brawley's reticence, are
nowhere near making an arrest.
   ``That (silence) ultimately might jeopardize and prejudice the
opportunity to bring charges against anybody. It's been
perplexing,'' said state Attorney General Robert Abrams,
supervising eight investigators and 12 prosecutors on the case.
   Abrams hinted the grand jury would look at possible obstruction
of justice by Sharpton and Brawley's lawyers, C. Vernon Mason and
Alton Maddox, militant activists known for raising the voltage in
racially charged cases.
   ``There will be all facts taken into account, including the
behavior of the lawyers,'' Abrams told CBS Radio.
   ``I challenge him to arrest us and prove in court that we're
obstructing justice,'' Sharpton retorted later in the interview.
``He should quit bluffing.''
   Brawley's advisers have led marches through Wappingers Falls,
made charges at news conferences and postured before cameras. This
legal and media circus around the case has also had its sideshows.
   Entertainer Bill Cosby and Edward Lewis, publisher of Essence
magazine, offered a $25,000 reward to find the truth.
   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and promoter Don King
spent six hours with Brawley on Feb. 13. Tyson gave her his
$30,000, diamond-studded Rolex watch. He and King pledged $50,000
apiece to pay her college tuition.
   But the truth is unknown. And no place is more eager for the
truth than Wappingers Falls, a village of 5,000 whites and 100
blacks 70 miles north of New York City.
   Townspeople are doubly weary _ of the reporters who come to glue
together shreds of an account that has given headline writers for
New York tabloids a workout, and of waiting to hear the truth.
   ``The best thing would be for this bimbo to open her mouth and
tell what happened or drop the whole thing,'' said Carlos
Rose-White, 42, a substitute teacher, a lifelong resident and a
black. ``People are getting sick of it. We want to know what
happened and who did it. All we're getting is second-hand
information.''
   Rose-White also challenged the girl's allegation of racial
motives, saying, ``My sister asked me how come she's walked this
town for 40 years and the Klan waited for Tawana Brawley.''
   For now, the case has more questions than answers.
   On Nov. 24, Brawley skipped classes at R.C. Ketcham High School
to visit a former boyfriend in jail, 13 miles away. She rode the
bus back and was last seen about 8:45 p.m. at a bus stop a mile
from her home.
   Four days later, former neighbors saw her crawling into the
garbage bag on the ground outside her family's recently vacated
apartment, where her mother had just checked for unforwarded mail.
   Her clothing was different from when she vanished, and her
soiled denim jacket was in an idle washing machine in the building.
   Lt. Bill McCord of the Wappingers Falls police said her mother,
Glenda, first reported the girl missing at 2:02 p.m. Saturday _ 17
minutes after she was found.
   Brawley gave police the barest scraps of information, writing
brief notes accompanied by grunts and nods. She said she was
abducted by two white men in a dark car, one with blond hair and a
light mustache who flashed a police-type badge and wore a holster.
   Brawley said she was driven to a wooded area where more white
men waited to rape and sodomize her. One urinated in her mouth, she
said. She remembered few other details.
   At a hospital, a black policeman asked who did it. Brawley
pointed to his badge and scrawled on a pad: ``white cop.''
   Last month, the New York Daily News reported how, 18 months ago,
a classmate of Brawley's told a similar tale of being abducted and
assaulted by two men in a dark car. Poughkeepsie police found she
concocted the story to conceal abuse by a family member.
   A friend said Brawley had recently angered her stepfather, Ralph
King, by staying out late after a party. King, 40, a bus driver
known around town for a quick temper, spent seven years in prison
for fatally shooting his first wife.
   Tom Croshier, bartender at O'Toole's, said patrons question
Brawley's account because of the family's known domestic problems.
``The general feeling is it's a family affair,'' Croshier said.
   Meanwhile, the investigation has had its fits and starts.
   William Grady, the Dutchess County district attorney, quit the
case because one of his assistants, Steven Pagones, was a friend of
Harry Crist Jr., a part-time cop in Fishkill who killed himself
Dec. 2.
   Crist, 28, who lived four blocks from Brawley, fit the girl's
description of a fair-haired man with a mustache. He said in his
suicide note he was jilted by his girlfriend and failed to get a
job as a state trooper.
   Investigators drew no link to the Brawley case, but Brawley's
advisers accused Crist and Pagones of being assailants. Pagones has
threatened them with a slander suit.
   A special prosecutor also quit after one day. The state attorney
general took over Jan. 26.
   Brawley's advisers have challenged every official effort to
investigate the case.
   They balked at cooperating because they thought John Ryan, an
Abrams aide, wasn't sensitive enough in civil rights matters. Then
they insisted that Abrams handle the trial, even though he had
little courtroom experience.
   If Sharpton can't get an impartial state prosecutor, he wants
U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani to take over.
   ``They simply don't wish to cooperate,'' said Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The governor also warned, ``The trail is getting cold.''

<HEAD>Bombastic Brawley Adviser Loves Limelight, Publicity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tawana Brawley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, the bombastic Pentecostal
minister with the James Brown hairdo and gift for gab, climbed atop
the soap box long before he found the Tawana Brawley case.
   ``I've been screaming ever since the doctor slapped me at
birth,'' said Sharpton, 33, a parishless preacher from Brooklyn who
wears a Martin Luther King Jr. medallion on a chain around his
beefy neck.
   ``Silence is not one of my characteristics,'' Sharpton said.
``Anytime somebody tells me I get a lot of attention on my causes,
that's a compliment. An activist is supposed to get attention. What
am I supposed to be, an activist that kills the limelight on an
issue?''
   Reports, however, suggest Sharpton mouths off to more than just
the news media.
   In January, Newsday reported Sharpton gave information on black
leaders, elected officials, organized crime figures and others to
the FBI. Sharpton was also allegedly under investigation for
scalping rock concert tickets earmarked for ghetto youth, but has
denied any wrongdoing.
   ``All that was a whole lot of talk. That's all. There's no grand
jury. We gave some drug information,'' Sharpton said.
   Sharpton has directed anti-drug rallies and took to the New York
subways in December and January to lead the ``days of outrage''
protests against racial injustice in the city.
   He screeched about racism in Howard Beach, where three white
teen-agers were convicted of manslaughter last year in the death of
a black man they chased onto a highway.
   Now he is advising the 16-year-old Brawley, who he says was
abducted, raped and sodomized by a group of white men in a small
town 70 miles north of New York City. Racial epithets were written
on her body.
   On Sharpton's advice, she has refused to tell her story beyond a
fragmented, almost incoherent interview with police the day she was
found.
   State Assemblyman Roger Green, chairman of the Black and Puerto
Rican Legislative Caucus, has accused Sharpton of using ``tactics
that encourage race wars.''
   The Rev. Carl Fleminster, executive director of the American
Baptist Churches of Metropolitan New York, said it was a travesty
Sharpton and his friends had ``refused to let this investigation
proceed except on their own terms.''
   But Sharpton says he wants to focus on what he calls a pattern
of police and racial abuses.
   ``Enough is enough. We're going to break it on this case,''
Sharpton said.
   At age 4, Sharpton gave his first sermon, a 22-minute piece at a
church in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. He was
licensed to minister at age 10 and appeared with gospel singer
Mahalia Jackson when he was 16.
   As a 12-year-old, he met Adam Clayton Powell, the late
congressman and head of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church. ``You
know, kid, you got to know when to hit it and know when to quit
it,'' Sharpton said Powell told him.
   In 1969, Sharpton worked with Jesse Jackson on boycotts of food
stores under ``Operation Breadbasket.'' He says Jackson told him:
``Turn on the heat, and don't ever turn it off.''
   In 1972, Sharpton met James Brown, the self-proclaimed godfather
of soul music. Sharpton toured with Brown and reverently copied his
wavy hairdo.
   ``I thought I had seen God when I met Adam Clayton Powell. When
I saw James, I knew I had seen God. James is everything I would
think God would be if he was walking around,'' Sharpton said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   Through Brown, Sharpton met boxing promoter Don King at the
Muhammad Ali-George Foreman title fight in Zaire in 1974.
   King tried to give a check to Brown, who insisted on cash. King
relented and delivered $100,000.
   ``We counted it out on the floor,'' Sharpton said.

   The Utne Reader warned of ``The Coming
Crash'' months before the stock market nosedive. It foresaw a wave
of activism washing the country weeks before Americans took to the
streets to protest U.S. troops in Honduras.
   With a flair for prophecy and a circulation approaching 90,000,
more than double the figure of a year ago, Eric Utne's 4-year-old
digest of the underground and alternative press aims to chronicle
the intellectual voice of the Baby Boom generation.
   ``It's my hope and suspicion that the '90s are going to be far
different from the '80s and that people are going to start thinking
about social and political issues in a different way,'' said
executive editor Jay Walljasper, 32.
   ``I think we'll be right there helping to define and propel that
thinking. It's my hope we'll have our finger on the pulse the way
Rolling Stone did in the 1960s and '70s.''
   That's modest compared to Utne's designs.
   ``I want to change the world,'' said the magazine's 41-year-old
namesake and founder. ``That's why I started it. That's the
motivation. I want to find out in the process how the world should
be. I don't have a clear agenda. I think there are a lot of voices
to be heard.''
   Utne, Walljasper and associate editor Helen Cordes scan the
vast, largely left-of-center landscape of the alternative press and
excerpt the best they see in their bimonthly editions. The Reader
sells for $4 an issue.
   The editors say they've combed nearly 3,000 magazine titles in
search of material. The journals are stacked high in the Reader's
office above a gourmet coffee shop.
   Scanned along with familiar opinion magazines such as The Nation
and American Spectator are obscure journals like the India-based
``Manushi,'' printed alternately in English and Hindi; the
London-based ``New Ground,'' the self-billed ``journal of green
socialism''; and ``Daybreak,'' a national magazine by and about
American Indians.
   For some magazines, to be excerpted by the Utne Reader is to
have their whispers amplified to shouts. Many journals and writers
send their published articles to the Reader, Walljasper said.
   In turn, he said, editors and fans look to the Reader as their
line to the alternative press. Walljasper calls the hundreds of
special interest, often-eccentric periodicals the intellectual
equivalent of the network of radar stations set up on the nation's
perimeter to monitor incoming aircraft.
   ``It brings a lot to the attention of people who otherwise
wouldn't get that information,'' said Richard Reynolds,
communications director of the San Francisco-based Mother Jones
magazine.
   ``A person couldn't subscribe to all those magazines excerpted
unless they're a fanatic. I like the Utne Reader,'' Reynolds said.
   Added Dan Cohen, cultural editor of the New York newsweekly The
Guardian: ``It's sort of a Reader's Digest of progressive writing.
I'm glad it's out there.''
   The Reader's Digest comparisons are inevitable. The two share
the excerpting format. Coincidentally, both were conceived in the
Twin Cities, though the late DeWitt Wallace moved his digest from
Minnesota long ago.
   But Reader's Digest, in the middle of the mainstream, has little
interest in the kind of articles found on Utne's pages.
   Recent Reader cover stories include ``In Search of Meaningful
Ritual _ On Finding Customs and Ceremonies that Reflect Your
Values,'' and ``In Praise of Idleness _ How to Live Well Outside
the Fast Lane.''
   Conservative and liberal views are often juxtaposed in the
Reader, which flanks main pieces with numerous shorter, related
stories. Walljasper says the Reader ``doesn't preach to the
converted the way some publications do.''
   Nevertheless, Utne's interests and philosophy come through
loudly.
   New Age and ``holistic'' references abound. Utne, not
coincidentally, founded New Age Journal 14 years ago in his first
magazine venture. It lives on without him, printing articles on
natural foods, ecological politics and Eastern spirituality.
   Utne, a participant in the 1960s counterculture during his time
at the University of Minnesota, has worked as a literary agent in
Boston and as director of new ventures for Wilson Learning Corp. in
Eden Prairie. He describes his politics vaguely, saying he yearns
for ``a greener, kinder world.''
   Advertising for a managing editor in the first year, Utne listed
attributes that more or less match his own: ``a slightly skeptical,
ex-radical, hippie, spiritual-type magazine addict who's seen all
the movements for personal growth and social change and still has
hope for the future.''
   His original hope for the magazine has been met and then some,
Utne says. The idea was sprung by a direct-mail test that persuaded
eight investors to put up the $150,000 in seed money; he has not
had to go back for more.
   From the premier issue, a 12-page newsletter issued in February
1984, the Utne Reader has grown to 128 pages in the May-June 1988
issue. In a special report to readers in the latest edition, Utne
reports a ``secure, positive cash flow'' that has brought the
Reader to the break-even point.
   He states plans to begin Alternative Press Awards and to form a
business and professional association committed to social
responsibility.
   The Utne Reader doesn't have to be small and struggling just
because it's committed to small, often-struggling publications,
Utne said. Reader's Digest, he noted, didn't have a huge Baby Boom
audience to nurture its growth the way the Reader has.
   ``And they're selling 18 million an issue. I figure why
shouldn't we go just as big? In this day and age of media overload,
something that does the selecting and integrating job for (readers)
is really a useful service.''

   Vernon Tejas awoke uneasily in the
darkness of his snow cave, high on Mount McKinley. It was his 20th
day climbing the continent's highest peak, and he was the only
living soul for miles.
   But now someone, or something, seemed to be in the cave with him.
   ``It could have been just the wind,'' the 35-year-old Alaskan
recalled. ``But I was pretty convinced right then and there that
Naomi was in there with me.''
   On Feb. 12, 1984, Naomi Uemura became the first mountaineer to
scale Mount McKinley alone in winter. He vanished in a storm on the
way down, and some veteran climbers believe the Japanese explorer's
spirit still roams the mountain.
   Tejas called out ``Good morning!'' in Japanese. The roaring wind
outside gave the only reply, and Tejas settled back, convinced the
spirit was benign.
   The wind eased the next day, March 7, and Tejas climbed to the
summit, where he planted a Japanese flag to honor the man who
blazed the way for him. Then he did something Uemura failed to do.
He came back.
   Mount McKinley, elevation 20,320 feet, is considered North
America's ultimate mountaineering challenge. The vertical reach
from base camp on the Kahiltna Glacier to the summit is 13,200 feet
_ about 2,000 feet greater than the climb up Mount Everest.
   Each May and June, hundreds of climbers flock to McKinley.
Unbearable arctic weather forces more than half to turn back short
of the summit.
   In winter, the unbearable turns unbelievable. Temperatures can
dip to minus 58 degrees, and storms rake the mountain with
hurricane-force winds.
   Only four teams have made it to the top in winter since the
first expedition in 1967; two of them lost climbers. Uemura was one
of two climbers to die in a recent flurry of solo winter attempts.
   In all, McKinley's slopes are littered with the memories of more
than 50 dead climbers.
   Tejas knows all the grim mileposts _ crevassed areas named for
climbers they swallowed, a slope dubbed the Autobahn for the many
Germans who have fallen there _ and he uses them as warning signs.
   ``I want to challenge myself to live as fully and completely as
possible,'' he said. ``A lot of people will say, `You're doing
something that jeopardizes your ability to live.' But by living on
the edge, I can define life a lot easier. It doesn't make you love
it any less. It makes you love it more.''
   Tejas returned as something of a local hero. As he sat recently
in a sunlit Anchorage cafe, strangers kept interrupting to
congratulate him.
   They stopped partly because of his accomplishment, partly
because Tejas is hard to miss. His head, at its lower elevations,
is forested by a bushy black beard; the summit is bare, shaved
daily except for a neatly braided rattail.
   Tejas (pronounced TAY-hoss) stands 5-foot-8 and has a
personality that lives up to his hairstyle. A veteran of 13
successful McKinley climbs, most of them as a guide for Genet
Expeditions, he bounces boisterous yodels off the bergschrund and
readily pulls a fiddle from his pack to scratch out folk tunes.
   He came to Alaska in 1973, a flatlander from Houston. Within
three days, he stood slack-jawed in Denali National Park, watching
as clouds unveiled McKinley's towering north face. Tejas fell in
love.
   He worked construction jobs and lived in a tent to save money
``to get into climbing big time.'' He first climbed McKinley in
1978; the next year he was invited back to guide.
   In 1986, he led the first successful winter climb of Canada's
Mount Logan, North America's second-tallest peak. Two months later,
back on McKinley, he took part in a daring rescue, climbing over
the summit ridge and rappelling 600 feet to reach two altitude-sick
Korean climbers.
   National Park Service rangers discourage solo climbs of McKinley
and tried to dissuade another climber who started up the same day
as Tejas. That climber, with no previous arctic experience, was
flown out with frostbitten toes after five days.
   Tejas was not warned.
   ``I think Vern is a very special case,'' said Ralph Moore, a
mountaineering ranger who lauds Tejas as a cautious climber and a
meticulous planner. ``With Vern, it was a very calculated risk. He
knew what he was getting into.''
   Tejas proudly notes he can still count to 20 on his fingers and
toes, each digit intact and unfrozen. To prevent slips into
crevasses on his solo climb, he strapped a 16-foot extension ladder
to his body _ ``my aluminum albatross,'' he calls it.
   Tejas was flown to McKinley on Feb. 16 by glacier pilot Lowell
Thomas Jr. He carried 170 pounds of gear and enough food for 16
days. But as he packed a toboggan, he decided he had too much. He
left behind his tent and 20 pounds of food.

   He never missed the tent. Each night he dug a trench, then
covered it with a roof of snow supported by his skis, ladder and
other gear. As the temperature outside dipped to 20 degrees below
zero, the air inside stayed a comfortable 20 to 30 degrees above.
   Good thing. Tejas was confined to trenches, or to snow caves dug
by previous expeditions, for 16 of his 29 days on the mountain. He
hid in them from raging storms, eating half rations to conserve
food, stuffing in earplugs to sleep while the wind roared like a
locomotive.
   Tejas used precious hours between storms to inch upward.
Sometimes, he tossed bamboo wands ahead to gauge the slope in a
white landscape made featureless by blowing snow. He reached the
top, in a whiteout, on the 21st day.
   ``I put a Japanese flag on the summit, out of respect for
Naomi's spirit, took a few pictures, and got the heck out of
there,'' he said.
   Tejas picked his way down the mountain, finally reaching base
camp on the 27th day. He dug in and waited. Two days later, on
March 16, the clouds lifted and Tejas was flown the 130 miles south
to Anchorage, where he stepped into a circle of reporters and the
arms of his girlfriend, Gail Irvine.
   Tejas said his month on the mountain reinforced his conviction
that people are not solitary creatures at heart. It deepened his
relationship with Irvine and stirred thoughts of his father, to
whom he hadn't spoken for 19 years.
   ``The first thing I wanted to do when I got back was call him
and tell him I love him,'' Tejas said. ``Unfortunately, he was out
of town, but he called me. He'd heard about the climb.''
   Tejas seems to have returned from a month of risking death even
fuller of life.
   ``If you take on a challenge that is bigger than you, and you
overcome the obstacles in the way, you become a bigger person for
it,'' he said. ``You find your own limitations, but you also find
your true ability in the process.''
   Tejas is still exploring his limitations. Earlier this month, he
led a climb in eastern Alaska's Wrangell Mountains, and he's
scheduled to lead two groups up McKinley in May.
   Tejas had hoped to make last month's climb even more historic by
being the first to descend from McKinley's summit hanging from a
parasail.
   The swirling snow foiled that plan, but the parasail is cached
near the summit. With a wide grin, Tejas said he just might be able
to find it.

<HEAD>For Renaissance Specialist, Authenticity Is In the Ear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though the Tallis Scholars seldom sing anything
more recent than the 17th century, Peter Phillips doesn't consider
the group to be part of the early music revival.
   Nor does the young conductor worry very much whether the
Scholars mimic the sound of the Renaissance.
   ``We can't possibly guess, and we can't possibly know,'' he said
during the British group's recent U.S. tour. ``It's not like
digging up an instrument which has been buried, and reanimating
it.''
   The standard of authenticity, for Phillips, boils down to what
sounds good. ``I hope that is based on how the choirs were
constituted, and how it did sound in the 16th century,'' he added.
   The Scholars are now the busiest exponents of sacred music of
the Renaissance, and are doing well enough to sustain their own
label, Gimell.
   Tallis Scholars recordings have a heavily English flavor, with
two by Thomas Tallis, two more featuring the music of William Byrd
and the Missa Gloria Tibi Trinitas of John Taverner.
   There is also a single recording of music by the contemporary
composer John Tavener, who was commissioned by the Scholars.
   However, the group's best seller has been its recording of two
masses by Josquin Desprez, a Flemish composer who died in 1521. The
performance was honored as record of the year for 1987 by
Grammophone magazine.
   Debates about the performance of ancient music are often heated,
and at times extreme. Phillips said he has heard it categorically
stated that the music of Palestrina was meant to be sung one voice
to a part, and that the music of Lassus ideally should have 12
voices per part _ though the two men were contemporaries writing in
similar styles.
   ``Experts tend to have their hobbyhorses, I find,'' Phillips
said. ``I can't afford to get bogged down with these endless
details, and not see my way through to a good performance.
   ``In the end, I am most interested in preserving this beauty of
sound, and I will not let dogmatic authenticity get in the way.''
   The voice he wants, Phillips says, is one ``which can sustain a
contrapuntal line without distorting the texture, and that requires
singing in tune and without very much vibrato.''
   The group which toured this country included two basses, two
tenors, two countertenors (male altos) and four women sopranos. The
use of women, rather than boy sopranos, is Phillips' most obvious
departure from the practice of the 16th century.
   Phillips argues that ``authentic'' boy sopranos are no longer
available, because boys' voices now break at age 12 or 13. In the
16th century, voices broke in the late teens, so the boy soprano of
the time would have a riper voice and greater maturity as a
musician.
   Furthermore, Phillips said it is likely that women were used in
some Renaissance music, such as Byrd's later works for the private
chapels of Roman Catholic families. Whether that music was for one
voice or two voices per part, Phillips said, ``was very much a
question of how many people turned up for service.''
   Phillips, 35, was never a choirboy _ ``my parents did not think
of it, they aren't musical'' _ but he became interested in
Renaissance music as an undergraduate at Winchester College. He won
an organ scholarship at St. John's College, Oxford, where he claims
to have been a very indifferent performer.
   In the early 1970s, he came under the spell of David Wulstan's
choral group, the Clerkes of Oxenford, which was founded in the
1960s and used women. The Tallis Scholars were found in 1973, and
became a fully professional group in 1978.
   The Scholars are the only group recorded by Gimell, the
Oxford-based label which Phillips founded in partnership with Steve
C. Smith after cutting two records for EMI.
   ``It was obvious they weren't particularly interested,''
Phillips said. ``They wanted a money-spinner.''
   With his own label, Phillips has been able to record the music
of composers such as Clemens non Papa, who is obscure even within
the small world of early music. Gimell will soon release what is
apparently the first recording of music of Sarum chant, the
liturgical music of medieval England.

<HEAD>Florida Has Most Widespread Selling of False Immigration Documents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Immigration Amnesty, b0521 of April 20</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fraud, confusion and, for thousands, new rejection
have dogged the U.S. immigration amnesty program in Florida,
particularly for Haitian aliens who have for years charged unfair
treatment by the federal government.
   ``There's a general perception that they get treated differently
from the other groups,'' said attorney Douglas Lux, director of a
Lutheran Ministries program that helps aliens in Miami's ``Little
Haiti'' neighborhood. ``These are simple people. They don't know
who to trust. But they are hungry to be U.S. citizens.''
   He had just spent 30 minutes explaining to an upset young woman,
with her male friend translating into Creole, why the Immigration
and Naturalization Service had rejected her application for
amnesty. He asked who had prepared her application and was told a
notary public.
   Lux rolled his eyes.
   ``These notaries public just take their money and they don't
know what they're doing,'' he said, then explained to the woman
that she could appeal and file a new application with more
documentation.
   Lack of documentation has been a major problem for the aliens,
many of them poorly educated. Most have been living underground,
using aliases and trying to avoid the INS.
   The selling and presentation of false documents has been more
prevalent in Florida than any other state, the INS says. Some 20
percent of the nearly 100,000 applications filed in Florida were
recommended for denial, District Director Perry Rivkind said.
Nationwide, about 95 percent have been approved.
   The biggest problem has been with farmworkers, who rarely have
payroll records because they are paid in cash. At the program's
beginning, farm contractors sold false payroll records, with prices
reportedly ranging from $25 to $2,500.
   The U.S. Attorney's office said last week it would discontinue
Operation Cucumber, which resulted in 61 fraud indictments against
farmworkers and employers but was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the
courts.
   While non-farmworker aliens must provide documents proving they
have lived continuously in the United States since before Jan. 1,
1982, the requirements for farmworkers were much looser to ensure a
plentiful labor supply for the nation's growers. They need only
prove they worked 90 days picking crops in the year ending May 1,
1986. Their application deadline is Nov. 30, 1988.
   Haitians in Florida, estimated to number at least 200,000, have
long complained their treatment has been unfair.
   While Cubans who left their Communist homeland have usually been
welcomed with open arms, the U.S. government has battled in court
to uphold its view that Haitians are economic, not political,
refugees. Since 1981, the Coast Guard has patrolled off Haiti,
intercepting boatloads of would-be immigrants.
   However, the INS has included Haitians already on record with
the agency in a special class called Cuban-Haitian Entrants dealing
with huge influxes of Cubans and Haitians in 1980-81. Rivkind said
more than 40,000 Haitians have been granted residency in that class.
   But Haitians applying under the amnesty program sometimes don't
understand, or can't obtain, the required proof of residency and
employment.
   ``I understand their feelings,'' Rivkind said. ``But I don't
know how you can approve anything without some proof. We've got to
abide by the law, which has certain requirements.''
   The Haitian American Community Association of Dade County and
the Haitian Refugee Center Inc. have stopped helping with new
applications. Lux said such organizations, along with the Lutheran
Ministries and the American Friends Service Committee, are barely
keeping up with applications and lack the resources to handle
appeals.
   The Haitian advocates say the INS processors have become overly
skeptical because of the fraud cases.
   ``There are some crooks, but we shouldn't penalize the majority
because of a minority,'' said Gerard Jean-Juste, head of the
Haitian Refugee Center. ``It's a lot of headaches. To the U.S.
lawmakers, I say: `Be generous. We are Americans, too.'''

   You really don't need to know much about
investing to make a buck in the market these days.
   Not that it's easy. You do need a few hundred million dollars,
quick access to information, a good computer program and a
willingness to push the buy or sell button. Given all that, you
have a chance at another fortune.
   Your activities have almost nothing to do with understanding the
companies whose shares you buy or sell, or of assessing their
fundamental values, or measuring their management or determining if
they can remain competitive.
   Your purpose as a program trader is not so much to invest in the
potential earnings of corporations as it is to use the marketplace
as a tool. While you need not understand companies, you must
understand how to work the market.
   Your focus is not just short-term in the usual sense of the
word, which might mean a few months, but brief-term in the sense
that you deal with tiny price variations that might come and go in
a matter of minutes.
   Some critics say the various program trading techniques are but
a step away from manipulation. They say the public, sensing this,
will stay away from stocks, just as reasonable humans and animals
stay clear of the elephant herd.
   In recent days, Donald Regan, former head of Merrill Lynch, said
such actdivities should be outlawed, and former Attorney General
Nicholas Katzenbach suggested the public may come to view the
market as controlled rather than free.
   Congress is upset. Much of Wall Street is also disturbed, and
the New York Stock Exchange has won approval from the Securities
and Exchange Commission to curtail program trading whenever the Dow
Jones industrial average moves 50 points in a day.
   Much of the concern relates to extreme volatility that critics
attribute to program trading, which often kicks in automatically
when certain criteria are reached, thus exacerbating what otherwise
might be minor price changes.
   Program trading was among practices cited in the collapse of
Oct. 19 and in the 100-point-plus selloff in a few hours last week.
Not only is it associated with big moves, rightly or wrongly, but
with reversals as well.
   Institutions with computers, trading power, information and
programs can make quick money on volatility. But volatility
contradicts one of the basic promises of organized marketplaces,
that is, an orderly flow of transactions.
   A loss of confidence in organized markets is deadly. Reduce
confidence and you reduce participation. Reduce participation and
it means smaller commissions and maybe lower prices, too.
   Evidence of lowered confidence abounds today, measured by such
things as unstable prices, money left on the sidelines rather than
committed to stocks, and shrunken price-earnings ratios.
   Wright Investors Service points out that the price-earnings
multiple _ the number of times earnings at which stocks sell _ is
now down to about 13 times 1988 earnings for the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index. Last summer it was 20.
   This and other evidence undoubtedly was considered by the
Securities and Exchange Commission when it cited ``the fragile
nature of public confidence'' in approving the Big Board's
limitations on program trading.

   PPG Industries Inc. said Thursday strong
performances in its chemicals and fiber glass businesses and
favorable currency exchange rates helped first-quarter earnings
rise 36.5 percent from the same period last year.
   Net earnings were $118.6 million, or $1.07 per share, on sales
of $1.37 billion, compared to $86.9 million, or 73 cents per share,
on $1.26 billion in sales a year earlier.
   ``One result of our strategic emphasis on globalization and
value-added diversification is that lower North American auto
production and housing starts did not impede PPG's ability to
achieve substantial growth,'' Chairman Vincent A. Sarni said.
   PPG said its glass business benefitted from strong gains in the
European auto and construction markets and worldwide demand for
continuous strand fiber glass.
   Sales of new car coatings rose significantly in Europe and
Canada, and chemicals sales were considerably higher although PPG
divested units that had 1987 first-quarter sales of $37 million.
   PPG manufacturers glass, coatings and resins and chemicals.

year, the Treasury Department says.
   The March deficit topped a $23.9 billion shortfall in February.

imbalance is usually higher in March than in other months because
because people who owe taxes for 1987 generally wait until April to

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Two major pharmaceutical companies announced first quarter
profit gains on Thursday, with Squibb Corp. reporting a 31 percent
increase in earnings over the same period in 1987 and
Schering-Plough Corp. reporting a 20 percent gain.
   Squibb, based in Princeton, N.J., posted net income of $90.9
million, or 89 cents per share, compared with $69.4 million, or 66
cents per share, in the first quarater of 1987.
   Net sales rose 27 percent to $596.9 million from $470.4 million
in the 1987 quarter, the company said.
   ``Results for the quarter exceeded our expectations and
reflected excellent performances by our leading products, enhanced
by higher foreign currency rates,'' said Richard M. Furlaud,
chairman and chief executive officer of Squibb.
   Squibb said sales in the company's pharmaceutical section rose
28 percent to $510.3 million.
   Schering-Plough reported a profit of $101.5 million, or 91 cents
per share, compared with $84.9 million, or 72 cents per share, in
first quarter 1987.
   First-quarter sales of $752 million rose 10 percent over $686
million in the same period last year despite the sale of the
company's Dr. Scholl's foot-care businesses, Schering-Plough said.
   Company chairman and chief executive, Robert P. Luciano, said
the first-quarter sales and earnings gains stemmed primarily from
continued gains by Schering-Plough's pharmaceutical business, where
sales rose 22 percent during the quarter.
   Sales in the company's consumer segment were down 11 percent,
reflecting the sale of the company's Dr. Scholl's buinesses, the
company said.

disruptions that would boost prices. But those gains evaporated

   On Thursday, O'Connell said, traders began to look ahead with
some optimism to next week's OPEC meetings in Vienna, Austria.
   Representatives of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries will meet with officials of producing countries that are
not members of the 13-nation cartel, then hold a full ministerial

   The object of both encounters will be to seek ways of
coordinating production cutbacks in order to reduce world supplies
and boost prices.
   ``Whether it's right or wrong, I think this idea of linkage with
non-OPEC members has caught the traders' imagination,'' O'Connell
said.

   Home diaper delivery service is bottoming
out in Philadelphia, in what some industry watchers say is another
sign of the nationwide hard times facing an old-fashioned product.
   Damaged by the growth of disposable diapers, Dy-Dee Diaper
Service of Westmont, N.J., dropped its home-delivery service early
this month after almost 50 years and has laid off about 20 percent
of its workforce.
   Dy-Dee's longtime competitor, Dy-Dee Service of Philadelphia,
absorbed a few hundred customers, saw its local sales rise by 14
percent and is ``not hurting at all,'' says general manager Jake
Pilkington.
   But 12 other such services have dried up locally over the past
20 years.
   Nationally, the numbers have dropped by more than half to about
200 during that time, according to John A. Shiffert, executive
director of the Philadelphia-based National Association of Diaper
Services.
   Industry analysts estimate that disposables now account for up
to 90 percent of all diapers used, although Shiffert puts the
figure at 60 percent to 70 percent. He also contends that as many
babies, up to 800,000 nationwide, wear delivered cloth diapers as
they did 20 years ago.
   Shiffert and Odd Knutstad, manager of the Westmont company,
blame the intense, 20-year advertising campaign by disposable
diaper manufacturers for the demise of home delivery.
   ``By the time the baby is born, the woman has seen the ad
hundreds and hundreds of times for Pampers, and is seduced by them.
Her husband also,'' Knutstad said.
   ``We sent them literature, we called, but most people said,
`I've already made up my mind. I'm going to take disposables like
I've seen on TV.'''
   Diaper delivery services began declining drastically in the
mid-1960s, when Procter & Gamble Co., one of the first companies to
manufacture disposable diapers, stepped up its advertising
nationwide, Shiffert said.
   ``Disposable diapers before then were looked upon as temporary
things for travel,'' he said.
   As a result of the blitz, many family-owned diaper businesses
failed or were bought by larger companies, Shiffert said.
   In 1987, combined sales of Luvs and Pampers brands amounted to
nearly 16 percent of Procter & Gamble's $17 billion in revenue.
   Knutstad also blamed the growth of disposables on working
mothers, who have are not at home to receive solicitations from
delivery services. But peers in the business believe working
mothers will be the factor that turns the industry around.
   For example, Pilkington said two-career couples want the
convenience of a diaper service and can afford it. Disposables cost
at least $11 a box a week while Dy-Dee Service charges $12.25 for
90 diapers a week.
   Pilkington and Shiffert also think mounting trash disposal
problems will ultimately restrict the use of disposable products.
Ecologically-minded people already use diaper services, they said.
   Dy-Dee Service in Philadelphia predicts it will expand
deliveries beyond its current 4,000 households. The company, a
division of General Health Care Corp. of Piscataway, N.J., operates
18 growing diaper-delivery services nationwide, Pilkington said.
   Knutstad also foresees an improving market but said it will not
develop soon enough for the Westmont firm. The company will
concentrate on accounts with nursing homes and diversify its
services for at least five years, when it might again target homes.

<HEAD>GM First-Quarter Profit Up 18.4 Percent But Operating Income Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

   General Motors Corp.'s earnings over the rest of
1988 should improve from their first-quarter performance, despite
an expected slowing of auto sales in the United States, industry
analysts predict.
   GM's first-quarter earnings rose 18.4 percent against a year
ago, due primarily to an accounting change, while its operating
income fell 4.3 percent, GM reported Thursday.
   The nation's largest automaker said it earned $1.09 billion, or
$3.11 a share, on sales of $26.4 billion in the first quarter. In
first-quarter 1987, GM earned $922.5 million, or $2.62 a share, on
sales of $26.1 billion.
   Without the accounting change, which boosted GM net income by
$224.2 million, first-quarter earnings would have been 5.9 percent
lower than a year earlier at $868 million, or $2.41 a share.
   The automaker's operating earnings fell 4.3 percent to $657.6
million in the first quarter from $687.4 million a year ago, the
result of production cutbacks, the costs of buyer incentives and
increased labor costs, GM said.
   GM's worldwide vehicle sales were down 5.2 percent from
first-quarter 1987. U.S. sales account for about 61 percent of GM's
worldwide vehicle sales.
   U.S. sales of American-made cars and trucks to dealers fell
nearly 16 percent against the first three months of 1987 as dealers
balanced their inventories. But on the retail side, dealers' sales
of GM vehicles including imports rose 12 percent on cars against a
year ago and 24 percent on trucks.
   David Healy, industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
in New York, predicted GM's sales and earnings would improve in
later quarters due to boosts in vehicle production and to the
first-quarter clean-out of dealer inventories.
   ``They're scheduling a lot more production of cars and trucks in
the second quarter so they could earn even twice as much as in the
first quarter,'' if the one-time accounting change is excluded,
Healy said.
   Chris Cedergren, an analyst with J.D. Power and Associates in
Agoura Hills, Calif., said he expected U.S. auto sales to slow in
the second quarter, delaying improvement in GM earnings until later
in the year.
   But GM's earnings will benefit from further cost cuts in the
second quarter, Cedergren said.
   GM would not provide figures for earnings or losses on GM's U.S.
automaking business. GM earned only a nominal profit on its U.S.
vehicle business for all of 1987.
   On Wednesday, GM had reported earnings rose for two of its
subsidiaries, GM Hughes Electronics Corp. and Electronic Data
Systems Corp., but fell for its finance subsidiary General Motors
Acceptance Corp. because of cut-rate loans to consumers and fewer
auto sales.
   GM said it made improvements in manufacturing efficiency and
engineering, but the gains were not enough to offset lower sales,
GMAC's lower earnings and cost increases that included wage
increases under a new labor contract.
   ``We're going to continue to cut costs and improve the
efficiency of our plants and the quality of our products,'' the
company said in a statement attributed to GM Chairman Roger Smith
and GM President Robert Stempel.
   In 1987, GM trimmed $3.7 billion from its costs under the first
phase of a four-year plan that calls for $4 billion in cost cuts in
1988. GM said it cut $1.3 billion from its costs in first-quarter
1988.

   The head of software giant Lotus Development
Corp. vaulted past Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca last year as
the nation's highest-paid boss, according to a list compiled by
Business Week.
   Jim P. Manzi, the 36-year-old chairman of Lotus, made $26.3
million in salary, bonuses and stock options during 1987, topping
the $17.9 million taken home by Iacocca, who had been the top-paid
executive of 1986, the magazine said Thursday.
   Figures were compiled for the annual ``Executive Compensation
Scoreboard'' being published in Business Week's May 2 edition.
   The list, which covers 339 companies, shows that with long-term
compensation the average chief executive's total pay jumped 48
percent in 1987 to $1.8 million, one of the largest single
increases ever.
   Business Week attributed the gains largely to stock options that
were exercised prior to the Oct. 19 market crash.
   Excluding long-term pay, the average chief executive's salary
and bonus rose 8 percent to $975,617, much less than the 18 percent
average increase in 1986 and slightly below the 8.6 percent that
most managers settled for, the magazine said.
   The third-highest paid executive was Paul Fireman, chairman of
running shoe company Reebok International Ltd., who collected a
total of $15.4 million.
   Two of the highest-paid bosses worked for the same company,
Waste Management Inc. No. 4, President Phillip B. Rooney, collected
$14.3 million, while No. 6, Donald F. Flynn, senior vice president,
collected $13.2 million.
   In a separate analysis of the relationship between pay and
company performance over a three-year period, Business Week said
the executives who delivered the most to shareholders were Robert
A. Swanson, chairman of Genentech, Inc., and Richard G. Cline,
chairman of Nicor Inc.
   Swanson was credited with giving shareholders of the innovative
biotechnology company the largest return in stock appreciation and
dividends for the least pay in the past three years. Cline was
credited with earning the least relative to the profitability of
his company, a natural gas utility.
   Business Week said the worst performers were Iacocca and John F.
McGillicuddy, head of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   Iacocca's pay was the highest relative to Chrysler's return to
shareholders, while McGillicuddy earned the most measured against
the bank's weak financial performance due to hard hit by Third
World loans.
   Some bosses who lost their jobs were big winners because of
so-called ``golden parachute'' severance awards they had negotiated.
   A separate list of the largest severance packages was led by
Terrence A. Elkes, ex-chairman of Viacom Inc., who got $25 million
after a takeover of his company by National Amusements Inc.
   No. 2 was Robert Fomon, former chairman of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc., who got $16.6 million after the company was acquired by
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Earnings Improve In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. says it net
income soared in the first quarter, but most of the gains were
proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations, the company said
Thursday.
   The transportation and natural resources company reported net
income of $343 million, or $2.18 a share, for the first three
months of 1988, compared with $45.9 million, or 29 cents a share,
for the same period a year ago.
   Excluding a gain of about $324 million from the sale of its
California timber operations, some of its pipelines and its leasing
subsidiary, Santa Fe's net income for the quarter declined to $18.7
million from $38.8 million.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled nearly $1.36 billion compared
with $1.23 billion a year earlier.
   ``The lower net result is no surprise, as it reflects
anticipated non-recurring expenses of approximately $30 million
incurred in connection with our restructuring program and a $57
million increase in interest expense,'' Santa Fe President Robert
D. Krebs stated.
   The interest expense resulted from the company's borrowing of
$3.7 billion and issuing of $780 million in debt securities to make
a $30-a-share payment to stockholders as part of its restructuring
plan, Krebs said.
   Operating income increased 57 percent to $153.1 million. The
Santa Fe Railway contributed $51.4 million in operating income and
had its best quarterly results in recent history, Krebs said.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. says it no longer is considering
selling the entire company as a defense against a $1.7 billion
hostile takeover bid launched by Brian Beazer.
   But talks are continuing with unidentified third parties about
possibly selling parts of Koppers' chemicals and construction
materials and services divisions, according to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing made availale on Thursday.
   Koppers Chairman Charles R. Pullin said March 27 that
discussions were being held with unidentified third parties about
selling the entire company to keep it out of Beazer's hands.
   A group led by Beazer and the investment firm Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. is offering $60 per share for Koppers.
   In response, Beazer issued a letter he sent Thursday to Pullin
saying Koppers' disclosure that it may sell only parts of its
chemicals and construction divisions ``is a radical departure'' for
the company.
   Beazer said that Koppers previously said it ``would not consider
selling the chemicals business because, among other things, the
sale of that business would create serious dislocation for Koppers
employees, especially those in Pittsburgh.''
   ``Indeed, if you proceed in your latest plan, it is you, not us,
who would empty the Koppers building,'' he said.
   The SEC filing also identified eight shareholder lawsuits that
have been filed in Delaware against Koppers and its management.
   ``The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the board
and...the company are engaged in a scheme to keep control of the
company for current management at the expense of public
stockholders,'' Koppers stated.
   The company did not comment on the lawsuits.

<HEAD>Bonds Fall On Inflation Fears; Stocks Mixed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to UPDATE with durable goods orders for
March; uppicks 2nd graf pvs: The yield...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gains in orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods in March were
offset by a drop in orders for military hardware, leaving the
overall balance virtually unchanged, the government said today.
   Total orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or
more years, amounted to a seasonally adjusted $114.3 billion last
month, the Commerce Department said.
   That was a tiny $53 million rise and followed a slight 0.1
percent increase in February and a sharp 1.2 percent drop in
January.
   While economists had been expecting a substantial increase in
March orders, the February number represented a sharp upward
revision from a previous estimate of a 1.1 percent drop.
   The report came as interest rates in bond market continued to
rise amid concerns that inflation is heating up again.
   The yield of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose
to 9.03 percent by late Thursday from 9.00 percent in the previous
session. The bond's yield rises when its price falls.
   Analysts also said the bond market took a dim view of the
government's report that it ran up a $29.1 billion budget deficit
in March, up from a $23.9 billion shortfall in February.
   David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago, said the market had expected the deficit to decline by $4
billion to $5 billion in March instead of rising.
   Big deficits mean heavy government borrowing, which tends to
push interest rates _ the cost of borrowing _ higher as competition
for funds increases.
   Oil futures prices, one indicator of potential inflation trends,
moved higher Thursday after a two-day retreat. Contracts for June
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
closed up 38 cents at $18.36 per barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Analysts said the credit markets showed no reaction to the
Federal Reserve's report that its three measures of the nation's
money supply rose in early April.
   On Wall Street, a sharp afternoon selloff wiped out early gains
to leave the stock market little changed from Wednesday's close.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up by more than 30
points at mid-session but finished the day up just 1.99 at 1,987.40.

<TEXT>
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Dennis R. Patrick said today the dial-a-porn industry is widespread
and largely ignores statutes designed to prevent its access to
children.
   Patrick said fines of $600,000 each imposed Thursday against two
California companies were based on their transmission of some
``very rough material'' over the phone to customers.
   ``The problem is very widespread,'' he said, ``not only in terms
of so-called dial-a-porn service providers but what appears to be a
widespread disregard of the statutory requirements as well as the
FCC's regulatory requirements.''
   Audio Enterprises Inc. of Mill Valley and Intercambio Inc. of
San Jose both used tape recordings that were changed daily to
attract callers who were then billed for the calls, Patrick said.
Similar services are advertised in sex-oriented magazines and
newspapers across the country.
   The companies were found in violation of regulations designed to
prevent access of obscene material to minors or transmission of
such material across state lines.
   Audio Enterprises and Intercambio denied the material they used
was obscene and said they did not have the capacity to screen calls.
   Patrick, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning'', said both of the
companies admitted they had made no effort to ensure that only
consenting adults made the calls.
   He said telephone company liability is not at issue under the
statutes. He said on Thursday that AT&T collected $5.5 million from
calls made to one Audio Enterprises line, of which $650,000 went to
Audio Enterprises.
   The use of access codes, message scrambling or credit card
numbers are required by FCC rules, but Patrick said this is widely
disregarded.
   Patrick said the commission had no difficulty determining that
material available through the two California companies was obscene
by federal standards.
   He said he sees no problem with the First Amendment which
guarantees freedom of speech.
   ``After all, the First Amendment does not protect obscenity,''
he said.
   Patrick said the FCC generally supports legislative efforts to
outlaw dial-a-porn.
   Congress this week gave final approval to an education bill
containing a sweeping provision to ban all dial-a-porn and
President Reagan is expected to sign it. But legal experts said it
was probably unconstitutional.
   Thursday's fines followed an investigation triggered by
complaints alleging that access to the sexually explicit messages
caused the molestation of a 10-year-old girl and so disturbed a
16-year-old boy that he had to have psychiatric therapy.

<TEXT>
   Union workers voted Friday to reject a
company contract offer and continue an 11-week strike against P & O
European Ferries Ltd.
   But the company said it still plans to resume sailings from the
English Channel port next week.
   Several hundred ferry workers at a mass meeting here voted
overwhelmingly to stay off the job, said Alan Lamoon, a local
representative of the National Union of Seamen.
   He said the main obstacle to settlement was not pay but the
company's plan to reduce ferry crews from three to two, which the
union contends will threaten safety.
   But Graeme Dunlop, P & O managing director, said 60 percent of
the company's 2,200 workers had accepted a revised company offer
and that the 11-ship Dover fleet would be back in service next week.
   The latest package offers a further $760 a year in wages to
operators on two routes but makes no concessions on the company's
plan to cut 360 jobs and revise working hours.
   The wage offer would raise annual salaries to between $21,360
and $32,885, according to the company.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is asking South
Korea to ban high-tech goods to Communist countries by next year,
according to a published report.
   The Korea Economic Daily reported that the United States wants
South Korea to halt sales of computers and semi-conductor chips
under regulations of the Coordinating Committee on Exports to
Communist Countries.
   Although South Korea is not a COCOM member, the paper quoted
government officials as saying it signed a memorandum of
understanding with the United States last September promising to
abide by the regulations.
   U.S. and Korean officials are to meet in Seoul next month to
work out details of the agreement, the report said.
   The United States wants South Korea to honor the agreement
beginning next month, but South Korea hopes to delay it until next
year pending approval by its National Assembly, the paper said.
   South Korea is scheduled to hold elections on Tuesday to form a
new parliament. The first session of the parliament is not expected
until at least May.
   The paper, quoting sources at the Foreign Ministry and the
state-run Korea Trade Promotion Corp., said the COCOM regulations
may discourage efforts by South Korean firms to expand trade with
Communist nations, with which the Seoul government has no
diplomatic realtions.
   It was not officially known whether South Korea currently sells
any COCOM-regulated high-tech items to Communist nations.
   Unofficial industry figures show that South Korea sold about $2
billion worth of goods to the Soviet Union, China and other
Communist nations in 1986. The 1987 figures were unavilable.

issue slightly below 9 percent.
   But the mood remained subdued on Wall Street. With many

<HEAD>`Golden Parachutes' Turn to Lead for Some, Job-Search Expert Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is off today.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The generous severance plans called ``golden
parachutes'' can turn to lead weights for some fired executives,
lulling them into complacency when they should be out looking for
work, says the president of a large job-placement firm.
   ``They get seduced by the money. The golden parachute is totally
destructive of people,'' said James Challenger of Challenger, Gray
and Christmas Inc.
   Golden parachutes are designed to soften the landing of
corporate executives booted from office in takeover fights.
   But Challenger, whose company has counseled more than 20,000
displaced workers over the last 25 years, said there are cases
where the parachutes provide such a plush cushion the recipients
cannot seem to get on their feet again.
   ``I think it's a terrible thing to happen to people,'' he said.
``To me, money doesn't buy happiness. People have to work, they
have to like what they're doing.''
   Challenger said golden parachutes, typically consisting of a
lump sum equal to two to three years' salary, foster illusions of
financial security and keep recipients from aggressively seeking
new jobs.
   ``The job search is or should be a full-time job in itself until
employment is gained,'' Challenger said. ``The longer the
individual takes, the less he or she is likely to apply themselves
to the search.''
   In addition, he said, a job application showing an extended
period of unemployment _ regardless of the reason _ may raise
questions about motivation in the mind of a prospective employer.
   Not all consultants agree.
   For most executives who receive golden parachutes, the money is
a bridge between the old job and the next one, or between the old
job and retirement, said Webb Bassick, a partner in the
compensation-consulting firm of Hewitt Associates in Lincolnshire,
Ill.
   ``We're talking about people who make hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year,'' he said. ``It's not as simple as picking up the
want ads and finding a job.''
   Bassick suggested Challenger's real beef might be that
job-seekers with lots of money in the bank can afford to be picky,
making them difficult to place.
   But Challenger said that his company collects its fees from the
job seeker's old employer and that his opposition to golden
parachutes is altruistic, not economic.
   ``I'm opposed to anything that ruins a person's life,'' he said.
   Recipients of some of the most famous golden parachutes do not
appear to have abandoned their careers for the lifestyle of the
independently wealthy.
   William Haselton, former chairman of St. Regis Corp., drew about
$12 million in compensation, stock payments and a cash settlement _
the golden parachute _ from St. Regis when it was bought by
Champion International Corp. in 1984. But he stayed on as
Champion's vice chairman.
   Donald P. Kelly, the former head of Esmark Inc., got a $2.7
million compensation package in 1984 when Beatrice Cos. acquired
the company.
   Two years later, Kelly joined the investment firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts in taking Beatrice private in a record $6.2 billion
leveraged buyout.
   As a followup to that deal, Beatrice spun off E-II Holdings,
which is now being acquired by American Brands Inc. in a $2.7
billion deal. This time, Kelly's compensation reportedly includes a
$2.5 million parachute.
   But multimillion-dollar packages represent the high end of
executive severance plans, Challenger said.
   The golden-parachute concept has spread to smaller companies
where top executives earn less than $100,000 a year.
   At that level, severance pay is not enough to retire on, but it
is enough to get lazy on, he said.
   Challenger would not provide names, but cited the case of a
former real-estate company executive whose golden parachute
included some lucrative property holdings.
   ``This man can go around and look at his properties and say he's
managing them, but he really isn't managing them,'' Challenger
said. ``This man is in his early 40s. He can't spend his years
doing this.''

   Phillips Petroleum Co. said it has
agreed to sell its outstanding stock in Bartlesville-based Applied
Automation, Inc. to Mannesmann Capital Corp. of New York, the U.S.
affiliate of a West German company.
   Terms of the sale of the company, which employs 375 people, were
not announced. The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is
scheduled for closing in late May.
   Mannesmann, an affiliate of Mannesmann AG of Duesseldorf, West
Germany, plans to keep the company headquarters in Bartlesville and
to retain current employees, Phillips said in an announcement
Friday.
   ``The sale of Applied Automation is part of our ongoing program
to focus our resources on our core oil, gas and chemicals
businesses,'' said C.J. Silas, Phillips chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``With a new owner, Applied Automation will be able to broaden
its product lines and expand more rapidly, benefitting Applied's
customers, employees and the community.''
   Applied Automation is a major supplier of measurement and
control products for Phillips' worldwide operations. Incorporated
in 1968, it has engineering, research, manufacturing, service and
marketing offices in Bartlesville. It has sales and service offices
in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
   One of Mannesmann's main operating companies is Hartmann and
Braun, which manufactures and markets measurement instruments and
process control systems. Hartmann and Braun had sales of about $500
million last year. Applied Automation had sales of more than $50
million last year.
   David Snow, a Hartmann and Braun manager, will become president
of Applied Automation. Guy Sutherland, current Applied president,
will return to Phillips after a transition period, the company said.

<TEXT>
   J.P. Stevens & Co. late Thursday rejected a
$1.22 billion takeover offer from rival bidders whose buyout
proposal included splitting the textile giant's assets among them.
   Sources said a special committee of outside directors on
Stevens' board informed fabric maker West Point-Pepperell Inc. and
the investment firm Odyssey Partners that their joint
$68.50-a-share bid was unacceptable.
   The directors' objections focused on the length of time the
group's offer would be extended as well as whether Odyssey would
have been able to get financing to purchase its share of assets,
which sources said were valued at about $530 million.
   Because the offer was conditioned upon Odyssey's purchase of
assets, ``that raised the uncertainty'' that disturbed the board,
said one source close to the transaction.
   Sources also said that under the proposal, West Point could have
extended its offer beyond the 10 business days' extension required
by Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
   The board committee asked that the conditions be eliminated,
according to one source who added, ``now the ball's in their
court.''
   Among the assets Odyssey would purchase were Stevens' ``greige
goods,'' or unfinished textile operations. The division sells about
$235 million a year in unfinished fabrics and yarn.
   Odyssey's outstanding a $68.50-a-share tender offer, which has
been recommended by the Stevens board, is set to expire at midnight
EDT Tuesday, the same day Pepperell's competing $67-a-share tender
offer is set to expire.
   The two companies, which had bid against each other three times
in a heated auction, announced earlier in the week that they were
negotiating about making a joint bid for Stevens for $68.50 a share
in cash.
   Separately, the attorneys general of New York and the Carolinas
agreed to issue subpoenas Thursday to Pepperell, Odyssey and Bibb
Co., which has signed an agreement with Pepperell to purchase
certain Stevens assets.
   South Carolina Attorney General Travis Medlock said he was
concerned the three companies, in combining their efforts to
acquire Stevens, may have engaged in ``bid-rigging,'' a violation
of antitrust laws, in determining what price to pay for Stevens
stock.
   A spokesman for Pepperell said today that the company has ``not
been accused of any (antitrust) violations, and we are confident
everything we have done is in accord with all applicable laws.''
   The West Point, Ga., textile company is making its bid for
Stevens in conjunction with NTC Group, the parent of textile
manufacturer Bibb.
   Pepperell has received Federal Trade Commission permission to
sell half of Stevens' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines
to NTC Group for about $170 million.
   Bidding for Stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout
offer earlier this year from a group led by its own senior
management, including Chairman Whitney Stevens, a fifth-generation
member of the family that founded the company in 1813.
   Pepperell launched a $62.50-a-share tender offer last month
after Stevens agreed to a buyout by Odyssey at $61.50 a share.
Odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to $64.
   Pepperell increased its tender offer to $67 a share, but Odyssey
topped that by $1.50 a share just hours later.

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade in follow Thursday's sharp losses.
   Forecasts for more rainy weather in the nation's midsection kept
a lid on upward movement in early trading of the grains, and
soybeans continued to feel additional pressure from the advancing
South American soybean harvest, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But he said prices could stage a slight rally later in the day
in a burst of pre-weekend activity.
   ``We had a pretty severe break yesterday and we're due for a
little bounce today,'' Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.13\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to

cent lower with May at $1.63 a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 1}
cents lower with May at $6.58{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Analysts said the activity reflected
position-evening ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly and
quarterly cattle-on-feed reports, which were due out after the
close.
   Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at
70.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .55 cent higher
with April at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .10
cent higher with June at 48.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .37 cent to .65 cent lower with May at 52.75 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures prices settled mixed on Thursday.

   A congressional panel has subpoenaed the head
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond business to testify as
part of its investigation of the firm and the financial markets,
sources say.
   Michael R. Milken, whose operations have come under scrutiny in
the Wall Street insider trading scandal, was ordered Thursday to
testify April 27 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Drexel's chief executive officer, Frederick Joseph, already was
scheduled to testify next Thursday, but a subpoena was not
considered necessary in his case, one source said.
   ``Milken did not want to appear,'' the source said, and the
subcommittee, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., decided to
subpoena him.
   It was not clear immediately whether Milken actually would
testify.
   Kevin Madigan, the attorney at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.
office who sources said received the subpoena for Milken, was not
in his office late Thursday and queries were directed to Steve
Anreder, the firm's spokesman in New York.
   Asked about the subpoena, Anreder said, ``We can confirm that we
expect hearings next week.''
   Drexel's operations have been the subject of a broad government
inquiry because of the firm's reported past business links with
speculator and inside-trader Ivan F. Boesky, who is serving a
three-year prison term for securities fraud.
   Drexel repeatedly has denied any improper activities and neither
the firm nor Milken have been charged with any wrongdoing.
   Milken was the architect of Drexel's pioneering Beverly
Hills-based business in high-yield junk bonds, which in past years
frequently were used to help finance corporate takeovers like those
in which Boesky speculated.
   Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S.
attorney's office have been conducting investigations of Drexel.
   The subcommittee has been investigating Drexel for the last six
months, looking into its junk-bond operations, corporate finance
department, mergers and acquisitions department and executive
committee, a source said.
   A notice to subcommittee members from Michael Barrett, the
panel's chief counsel, said next Wednesday's hearing would be held
to receive testimony from Milken ``relating to the subcommittee's
investigation into the operations of the nation's securities
markets and the effectiveness of the federal securities laws.''

<HEAD>Icahn Announces New Plan To Take TWA Private</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Carl C. Icahn today resurrected his
proposal to take Trans World Airlines Inc. private, offering to buy
all shares in the company that he does not already own.
   Icahn, chairman of TWA, dropped a similar proposal after last
October's stock market crash.
   Under the new plan, the company would merge with a new entity
controlled by Icahn, who already owns 77 percent of TWA's 30
million outstanding shares.
   Upon the merger, public shareholders other than Icahn would
receive for each share a combination of $20 in cash and $29 in face
amount of notes paying 12 percent interest due in 2008.
   The announcement sent TWA stock up sharply. By midday, TWA was
up $7.50 a share at $35.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Under last year's proposal, those shareholders would have
received $20 in cash and $25 in face amount of the bonds.
   Icahn said his latest offer was conditioned upon approval by a
majority of the TWA shareholders not affiliated with him, and the
satisfaction of appropriate regulatory requirements.
   Once consummated, employee stock ownership plans would be
established to give employees about 10 percent ownership in the
newly merged company, a statement issued by TWA said.

   The stock market staged a moderate advance today
with a boost from declining interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.27 to 1,999.67
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 745 up, 521 down and
534 unchanged.
   A big chunk of that activity came in Southern Co., up \ at 22{,
and Cincinnati Gas & Electric, unchanged at 25|.
   Analysts said much of the trading in both high-yielding utility
issues involved strategies keyed to their impending quarterly
dividends.
   Otherwise, brokers said stocks got a bit of a lift from the bond
market. Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, dropping the yield of the longest Treasury
issue slightly below 9 percent.
   But the mood remained subdued on Wall Street. With many
investors standing aside, analysts say activity lately has been
dominated by computer program trading by professionals.
   On Thursday prices jumped in early trading, dropped sharply at
midafternoon and then rallied just before the close to finish
little changed.
   Trans World Airlines jumped 7 to 35[. Chairman Carl Icahn
announced plans to take the company private through an exchange of
cash and securities for the approximately 23 percent of the stock
he doesn't already control.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.73 to 145.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .10 at 296.61.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 79.80 million shares at
noontime, against 78.45 million at the same point Thursday.

   Dig in your pocket or purse, fish out a
handful of coins and ask yourself the question: Should the design
of America's pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and half dollars be
changed?
   A campaign is gathering steam in Congress to do exactly that.
   Advocates for change say the nation's coins should reflect the
nation's present, not its past. And they claim that minting new
coins would raise an estimated $2.3 billion for the government's
deficit-plagued coffers over six years.
   That's no small change. But the figure is disputed.
   Donna Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, told the Senate Banking
Committee today that redesigning the nation's coins would likely
raise a few million dollars in profits, but not billions.
   She estimated that the difference between production costs and
the face value of the coins would bring in about $2.2 million a
year and that an additional $3 million in annual profits can be
expected from sales of proof sets of the coins to collectors.
   Yet, she said that the U.S. Treasury finds ``generally nothing
objectionable'' in the proposal.
   The sparkplug behind the coin-redesign campaign is Diane Wolf, a
member of the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which has
endorsed the redesign plan.
   Making her case to the banking committee, Ms. Wolf said that it
is important to improve the design of the nation's coinage because,
``not only do our coins tell people in faraway lands something
about us and our heroes, ideals, dreams and celebrations; they also
speak to the ages.''
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the Banking Committee's
consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee, says the record shows
that chances of making billions of dollars from a redesign of the
nation's coins are remote at best.
   The legislation would retain the presidents who currently grace
the fronts of those coins, Lincoln on the penny, Jefferson on the
nickel, Roosevelt on the dime, Washington on the quarter and John
F. Kennedy on the half dollar.
   But it would permit different portraits to be used, and the
tails of the coins would be changed completely.
   The legislation dictates that the reverse of the quarter carry
for a two-year period a design commemorating the bicentennial of
the Constitution.
   Other elements of the design would be selected and approved by
the Treasury Department, perhaps after a national competition by
leading artists.
   Miss Wolf says the newly minted coins could be rattling into
cash registers by 1989 if Congress acts quickly this year.
   ``Aesthetically, the coinage really needs a redesign,'' she said
in an interview.
   ``This is the longest time we have gone without permanent
changes on our coinage,'' she said.
   ``The head of Lincoln on the penny is 79 years old. The tail was
last designed in 1959. The quarter is 56 years old. The nickel was
last designed in 1938. The dime was last designed in 1946.''
   According to Miss Wolf the new coins would be identical in size,
shape and color to present pocket change.
   ``There's no real opposition,'' Miss Wolf said. ``Everyone is
gung ho on it. There are no negatives to this. We can make billions
to reduce the deficit without raising taxes.''
   No opposition? That's not quite the case.
   Annunzio has expressed reservations, especially about the
proposition that changing the design of coins raises billions.
   Miss Wolf argues that since it costs the Mint just 2{ cents to
produce a single coin, it can issue them for face value, making
money on every coin but the penny.
   She says much more money would pour in from collectors who would
rush to buy proof and uncirculated sets of the new coins.
   But Annunzio told the House on Tuesday that there have been six
coin design changes over the past 42 years and none supports the
theory that when coins change their faces the money rolls in.
   ``In fact, some of the changes showed a decline in mintages,''
he said. ``Those claiming that design changes will generate
billions of dollars in revenues base those claims on assumptions
that have no connection with fact or reality.
   ``Indeed, the evidence suggests that the effect that coin design
changes has on coin demand is so small as to be impossible to
measure. It is negligible at best.''
   In any case, Annunzio said the secretary of the Treasury has the
authority to change the design of coins without approval by
Congress.
   ``We should reject attempts to respond to the siren's song of
easy revenue through coin design changes,'' Annunzio said. ``There
are no profits to be made.''
   What about people who are comfortable with the coin designs as
they are and want no changes?
   ``That might be the first impression of some people,'' Miss Wolf
said. But she said good new designs would convert them.
   After all, she said, the classic buffalo nickel went the way of
the beast it depicted. And so did the old Mercury dime.
   ``Coins really reflect how we feel about ourselves as a people;
coins should reflect our times,'' she said. ``And the coinage we
have just doesn't.''

   Bond prices moved modestly higher in early
trading today, influenced by a stronger dollar and other positive
economic news.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose 11-32 point, or nearly
$3.50 for each $1,000 in face value, as its yield slipped to 9
percent from 9.03 percent late Thursday.
   The dollar rose and commodities prices fell today, which helped
turn the credit markets around from a slight decline on Thursday,
said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist with the investment
firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   A Commerce Department report that durable goods orders were
virtually unchanged in March also helped bond trading, Held said.
   However, Held said, ``This kind of stuff should have inspired a
little more buying.''
   He said bond prices were being held back somewhat by nervousness
over next week's scheduled release of first-quarter gross national
product figures.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 1-32 point, intermediate maturities gained 3-32
point to 3-16 point and 20-year issues rose \ point, according to
the financial information service Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.15 to 110.62.
   In corporate bond trading, industrials were up \ point and
utilities rose [ point in very light trading, according to the
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.62 to 279.06.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell 3 basis points to 5.80
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills were down 2 basis points at 6.22 percent and
one-year bills fell 1 basis point to 6.56 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6} percent, down from 6~ percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Ashland Earnings Rise Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. reported dramatically
higher earnings in its fiscal second quarter, mostly due to strong
performance in the company's non-oil divisions.
   The company, a major refiner, said Friday it earned $21 million,
or 74 cents per share in the three months ended March 31, compared
with $1 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same period last year.
   Quarterly revenue totaled $1.9 billion, vs. $1.6 billion in the
1987 period.
   The sharp rise was led by ``outstanding results'' from Ashland
Chemical Co., the company's coal divisions and SuperAmerica
convenience stores, said John R. Hall, the company's chairman, in a
report issued Thursday.
   Hall also credited Ashland Petroleum Co., which reported $5
million in operating income, compared with a $35 million operating
loss in the 1987 quarter.
   Ashland Chemical had a record $28 million in operating income
for the qurater, with improvements in all product areas, Hall said.
   ``SuperAmerica had an excellent quarter with $11 million in
operating income,'' Hall said. ``Operating and equity income from
coal interests totaled $21 million, as Ashland Coal Inc. and Arch
Mineral Corp. had record second-quarter results.''
   For the six-month period, Ashland said it earned $92 million, or
$3.26 per share, on sales of $3.9 billion, compared with 1987
first-half profit of $28 million, or 86 cents per share, on $3.2
billion in revenue.
   The latest six-month earnings were favorably affected by an
accounting change which added $31 million, or $1.11 per share to
the figures.
   The company has continued its cooperation with state and federal
agencies investigating the Jan. 2 collapse of an Ashland Petroleum
storage tank near Pittsburgh, Hall said.
   Damage caused by the tank collapse and spill of about 1 million
gallons of oil into the Ohio and Monongahela rivers will be covered
by insurance, subject to a $2.5 million deductible, he said.
   Hall said the second-quarter results included a charge for the
deductible and unspecified charges not covered by insurance.

   A Yugoslav delegation and a committee
representing more than 400 of the country's bank creditors
worldwide have reached an agreement covering about $6.5 billion of
Yugoslavia's foreign bank debt, a bank committee spokesman said.
   The agreement covers all medium-term bank debts that fell due
under 1983-1988 restructuring agreements plus previously
unrestructured debt due in 1989 and 1990, John Meyers, a spokesman
for Manufacturers Trust of New York, said Friday. Manufacturers
heads the 16-member bank committee.
   The covered debts will be restructured as an 18-year-credit with
a six-year grace period on principal. The interest rate is the
London Interbank Offered Rate plus 13-16 percent.
   The LIBOR rate fluctuates and stands currently at around 7{
percent.
   The agreement also includes a trade and deposit facility of 300
million dollars for the Yugoslav Central Bank, which may use the
funds for any purpose up to June 30, 1990. After that the loan will
become a trade facility, Meyers said. The rate on this loan is
LIBOR plus ~ percent.
   The agreement, reached after talks that began April 13, will be
mailed out to 450 creditor banks for their approval early next
month.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `This morning ...,' with 1 graf to UPDATE with
Sarokin polling jurors and again rejecting request for mistrial.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREA HAMILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for three tobacco companies today
unsuccessfully sought a mistrial in a major cigarette liability
case, arguing the judge's criticim of the industry and publicity
about his statements may have tainted the jury.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin, acting Thursday on the
companies' request to have the case thrown out, said there was
enough evidence of a cover-up by the tobacco industry that a jury
should decide the suit. However, he did dismiss some of the
complaints against the companies _ Liggett Group Inc., Philip
Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc.
   This morning, Sarokin rejected the companies' request for a
mistrial. He upheld his ruling after polling the jurors
individually in private and discovering they did not know of
Thursday's finding.
   In his sometimes scathing opinion, Sarokin wrote, ``The evidence
presented ... permits the jury to find a tobacco industry
conspiracy, vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and
devastating in its results.''
   The suit by Antonio Cipollone of Lakehurst alleges that the
companies were responsible for the lung cancer death of his wife,
Rose, who died at age 58 in 1984 after smoking for 40 years.
   Chuck Wall, a spokesman for Philip Morris and Lorillard, on
Thursday took exception to the tone of Sarokin's opinion. ``I do
think there were flourishes there from the judge's pen that went
beyond the plaintiff's evidence,'' he said.
   Sarokin dismissed claims that the three companies caused Mrs.
Cipollone's cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette and by not
conducting adequate research into the health effects of smoking.
   The suit has been on trial since Feb. 1, and Cipollone's lawyers
have rested their case, which they tout as groundbreaking because
for the first time a plaintiff's lawyers obtained access to
confidential files of tobacco companies and trade groups detailing
their public relations strategies.
   In his 33-page opinion, Sarokin wrote that the evidence
indicated the companies conspired to conceal and misrepresent
information on the dangers of smoking and to ``refute, undermine
and neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical
community.''
   The judge said the evidence also indicated the companies tried
to ``confuse and mislead the consuming public in an effort to
encourage existing smokers to continue and new persons to commence
smoking.''
   ``The jury may reasonably conclude that defendants were members
of and engaged in that conspiracy with full knowledge and disregard
for the illness and death it would cause, and that Mrs. Cipollone
was merely one of its victims,'' Sarokin said.
   Rejecting the defense request to dismiss all claims, he wrote,
``If the jury accepts the plaintiff's version of the facts as to
the conduct of the defendants, it is difficult to envision a more
compelling case for an award of punitive damages.''
   Despite the criticism of the tobacco companies, Wall said he
believed Cipollone's case was gutted by Sarokin's opinion. ``The
conspiracy claim is very tenuous at best,'' he said.
   Cipollone's attorneys denied the claims dismissed by the judge
went to the heart of their case. ``I think the judge was moved by
the evidence. It's powerful evidence,'' said attorney Alan Darnell.
   Attorney Cynthia A. Walters denied that her side suffered a
critical blow when the judge ruled the plaintiff could not prove
Mrs. Cipollone would have smoked a safer cigarette if the companies
had marketed one.
   Referring to evidence that the companies knew how to produce a
safer cigarette but chose not to, she said, ``We thought it was an
important theme, not so much for this case but for the broader
implications in future cases.''
   Sarokin also dismissed a claim that Mrs. Cipollone's death was
caused in part by the companies' failure to do enough research on
the dangers of smoking. While there was ample evidence that the
research was inadequate, the judge said, Cipollone's attorneys did
not prove that this directly harmed Mrs. Cipollone.
   A third claim, that the companies failed to warn smokers of the
dangers of cigarettes, was dismissed against Philip Morris and
Lorillard.
   Sarokin said Mrs. Cipollone smoked only Liggett cigarettes
before 1966, when federally mandated warnings on cigarette packs
were required. He said there is evidence ``from which the jury
could infer that, prior to 1966, ordinary consumers were not
adequately informed of the health risks of smoking,'' he said.
   James Kearney, an attorney for Liggett, said the company was
``confident we will prevail on the basis of evidence that comes out
during our presentation.''

<HEAD>Norway To Continue Restraining Oil Output Second Half Of 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway said Friday that it would continue
restraining its oil output by 7.5 percent of actual production
during the second half of 1988.
   Norway is not a member of the Organization of Oil Exporting
Countries but it has supported OPEC's effort to curb production to
help stabilize worldwide oil prices since February 1986.
   ``The effort will continue on the condition that other exporting
countries carry out realistic regulation efforts to stabilize oil
prices at a reasonably high level,'' Norway's Oil and Energy
Ministry said in a statement.
   The ruling was made by the cabinet and does not need approval by
the parliament.
   Since no new oil fields are scheduled to open in Norway during
the year's second half, the decision means the nation will restrain
its total production capacity of 1.06 million barrels a day by
about 85,000 barrels.
   Egil Helle, a ministry spokesman, acknowledged a connection
between the decision and the April 26 meeting between OPEC and at
least seven non-OPEC oil producers. Norway will not officially
attend the meeting, although it will send an observer.
   ``We have had many questions from outside Norway in connection
with the meeting and our attitude toward a stable oil market,''
Helle said, explaining the reason for his announcement.
   A senior oil ministry official said last week Norway would be
willing to consider further restraints if production cuts are
agreed on at the Vienna meeting.

<HEAD>Head of Crash Study Blames Japanese Selling of U.S. Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a presidential panel that
investigated the October stock market crash says massive selling of
U.S. Treasury bonds by Japanese investors incited the plunge, the
Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
   Nicholas F. Brady, co-chairman of the investment banking firm
Dillon Read & Co., also claims the Federal Reserve injected more
than $10 billion into the U.S. financial system in the days after
the crash, the Journal said. Federal Reserve officials said they
could not comment.
   Brady was quoted as making the assertions at a meeting of
institutional investors and money managers Thursday in Washington.
He was traveling Friday and his secretary said he was unreachable.
   His reported remarks were considered significant not only
because Brady led the panel that investigated the crash, but also
because of his possible future role as a Treasury Secretary if Vice
President George Bush wins the presidential election. Brady is a
Bush confidant.
   ``People ask me: What was it that blew it off on the 19th of
October _ was it the twin (trade and budget) deficits, was it the
Rostenkowski (tax) legislation, what was it?,'' Brady was quoted as
saying.
   ``I don't think it was any of those things that really was the
trigger,'' he was quoted as saying. ``The real trigger was (that)
the Japanese came in for their own reasons and sold an enormous
amount of U.S. government bonds, and drove the 30-year government
(bond) up through 10 percent. And when it got through 10 percent,
that got a lot of people thinking, `Gee, that's four times the
return you get on equity. Here we go, inflation again.'''
   The Brady panel's crash report, released in January, said the
weakening dollar and higher interest rates were key elements in the
uncertainty that helped cause the crash.
   But his reported remarks Thursday marked the first time Japanese
holders of U.S. bonds were specifically mentioned as the catalyst.
It wasn't clear from the Journal account whether Brady had changed
or amended his views after the study was done.
   Brady also was quoted as expressing frustration with the
progress of post-crash changes in market regulation, particularly
the apparent jurisdictional fight between the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which watches stock trading, and the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which watches stock-index
futures and options activity.
   He also was quoted as warning that if the market crashes again,
``punitive'' legislation would result.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
lower Friday in light dealing as buying interest dwindled to a
standstill at the end of the latest settlement period for stock
trading.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
20.3 points, or 1.13 percent, at 1,771.6.
   Volume was an unusually strong 514.9 million shares, compared
with Thursday's 397.9 million shares.
   Although Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average started
stronger Friday, the London market largely ignored New York's
firmer start.
   Equity dealers said because Friday was the final day in the
two-week trading account, many players were closing out positions
acquired earlier. Other than the book-squaring, ``activity is at a
snail's pace,'' one dealer said.
   Another trader said that buying interest ``dried up'' because of
the lack of takeover rumors which were so prevalent in the market
earlier in the week.
   At the close, the Financial Times 30-share index was 11.8 points
lower at 1,411.6.
   The Financial Times 500-share index closed down 10.18 points at
1,005.69.

   The stock market gained ground today with a
boost from declining interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.25 to 2,002.65
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 799 up, 585 down and
499 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 105.99 million shares with two

   A big chunk of that activity came in Southern Co., up [ at 22],
and Cincinnati Gas & Electric, unchanged at 25|.
   Analysts said much of the trading in both high-yielding utility
issues involved strategies keyed to their impending quarterly
dividends.
   Otherwise, brokers said stocks got a bit of a lift from the bond
market. Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, dropping the yield of the longest Treasury
issue slightly below 9 percent.
   But the mood remained subdued on Wall Street. With many
investors standing aside, analysts say activity lately has been
dominated by computer program trading by professionals.
   On Thursday prices jumped in early trading, dropped sharply at
midafternoon and then rallied just before the close to finish
little changed.
   Trans World Airlines jumped 7\ to 35]. Chairman Carl Icahn
announced plans to take the company private through an exchange of

   The dollar rose against major currencies Friday in
very sluggish European trading.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar rose mostly on
pre-weekend short covering and technical factors rather than for
fundamental reasons.
   ``It was a thin, poor day and you can't overglamorize the
dollar's move,'' said a London dealer.
   The British pound cost $1.8880 late Friday, cheaper for buyers
than late Thursday's $1.8990.
   In Japan, where trading ends of Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 124.65 in Tokyo. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 124.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at late Friday, compared with late Thursday:
1.6730 West German marks, up from 1.6660; 1.3840 Swiss francs, up
from 1.3755; 5.6865 French francs, up from 5.6550; 1.8770 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8675; 1,244.50 Italian lire, up from 1,238.50;
and 1.2324 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2329.
   Gold prices closed lower in Europe after dipping through a
support line of around $450. In London, the metal's late bid price
was $449 a troy ounce, down from $454.50 quoted late Thursday. In
Zurich, the late bid price was also $449, down from $454.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 13 cents to close at a bid
$454.77.
   Silver was quoted in London late Friday at a bid price of $6.46
a troy ounce, equal to Thursday's $6.46.

<HEAD>Judge Moves Up Irving's Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. was ordered by a state judge
Friday to hold a shareholders' meeting May 6 to determine whether
the company should merge with rival Bank of New York Co. or sell a
major stake to Italy's second-largest bank.
   Irving had postponed its annual meeting from Saturday to June 13
to give shareholders time to review the Bank of New York bid and a
management-backed offer from the state-run Banca Commerciale
Italiana of Milan, made earlier this week.
   But Bank of New York challenged the legality of Thursday's move,
denouncing it as a stalling tactic and an ``outrageous and
unprecedented attempt to thwart the rights of shareholders.''
   In Friday's ruling, New York Supreme Court Judge Herman Cahn
directed Irving to convene its meeting Saturday, then adjourn it to
May 6 to allow time for the shareholders to vote on a slate of
Irving directors and other matters that will determine the fate of
the two competing bids for the bank.
   Both Irving and Bank of New York said they were pleased with
Cahn's order. Irving attorney Robert Falise said, ``The court's
decision ... confirms Irving's decision to give shareholders more
time to learn about and analyze the fast-moving developments of
recent days and any other development that may happen before May
6.''
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said the court provided
``a victory for shareholder democracy'' by refusing to allow Irving
to postpone its annual meeting until late spring.
   ``Once again, the manipulative tactics of Irving's management
have been rejected by the courts,'' he said.
   Irving said Thursday that it had agreed to negotiate with Bank
of New York for the first time in their bitter, 7-month-old
takeover fight, but also would continue negotiating with Banca
Commerciale. Irving said it believed it could obtain improvements
in both offers.
   Bank of New York is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 of its common
shares for the approximately 95 percent of Irving it doesnt'
already own. The tender offer began last month following regulatory
approval.
   The company also is running a slate of 16 nominees for Irving's
board of directors.
   Banca Commerciale, which emerged as a ``white knight'' merger
partner Monday, has offered to pay $75 a share for 8.5 million
Irving shares, or a 45 percent stake in the company. Banca
Commerciale also would have the right to buy an additional 10
percent of Irving stock on the open market after the deal was
consummated.
   The deal was part of a complex restructuring that Irving
proposed as an alternative to Bank of New York's hostile offer. The
plan included the sale of several Irving assets, including its
50-story Wall Street headquarters.
   To win shareholder support, Irving also proposed to raise net
income by about $1.60 a share in 1988 and $2.75 next year through
cost-cutting measures and to pay a special $10-a-share special cash
dividend from the gains on the asset sales.

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts as weather
forecasters reduced predictions for rainfall. Grains were mixed.
   Long-range forecasts issued Thursday had predicted good amounts
of rain next week in the Midwest and Great Plains, where corn and
soybean planting is beginning and rain is needed to get the crops
off to a good start. Prices fell Thursday in reaction to the
forecasts.
   But new forecasts on Friday predicted lesser amounts of rain,
and the markets rallied on the news, analysts said.
   The soybean market is particularly sensitive to weather
forecasts because of indications that soybean stockpiles are
running low, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter

   ``Last Monday, a lot of states came out with reports showing
very low topsoil moisture,'' he said. ``It's not critical yet but
the market is very sensitive at this time of year to the weather.''

   Financier Carl C. Icahn offered Friday to buy
the 23 percent of Trans World Airlines Inc. stock that he does not
already own, resurrecting his proposal to take the company private.
   Icahn, who is TWA's chairman, dropped a similar proposal after
the stock market crashed on Oct. 19.
   Under the new plan, stockholders other than Icahn would receive
for each of their shares a combination of $20 in cash and $29 in
face amount of notes paying 12 percent interest due in 2008. The
company has 30 million common shares outstanding, of which Icahn
controls 77 percent.
   The announcement sent TWA's stock up sharply. In late afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, TWA was up $7.25 a share at
$35.37{.
   Louis A. Marckesano, airline analyst for the securities firm
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, called the offer ``a
good deal for shareholders ... generous in price.''
   ``The difficulty is putting a discounted value on the paper,''
he said. ``We'd put it at a (combined) value in the low $40s.''
   That would make the offer worth at least $276 million, at $40
per share for the 6.9 million shares Icahn does not already control.
   Edward J. Starkman, who watches TWA for PaineWebber Inc., said
Icahn's offer was ``a little richer than what a lot of people were
looking for.''
   ``We're thinking in terms of its being worth $36 to $38 (per
share), roughly _ and those kind of numbers look pretty good,'' he
said.
   Julius Maldutis, an analyst at the Salomon Brothers securities
firm, declined to comment on Icahn's offer, other than to say he
believed TWA's stock was worth between $40 and $42 per share.
   Icahn's previous offer was $20 in cash and $25 in face amount of
the bonds per share.
   A statement released by TWA said the new offer was conditioned
on approval by a majority of the TWA shareholders not affiliated
with Icahn, and the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory
requirements.
   In addition, it said Icahn reserved the right to change the
terms, if TWA's stake in Texaco _ consisting of about 20.6 million
shares, or 8.5 percent of the oil giant's stock _ should change
substantially in value.
   Once consummated, employee stock ownership plans would be
established to give the airline's employees about 10 percent
ownership in the newly merged company, a statement issued by TWA
said.
   Separately, TWA announced it lost $55.5 million in the first
quarter, slightly less than the $54.8 million it lost in the same
period last year.
   ``These results reflect substantially greater interest charges
during the first quarter of 1988 than existed in the first quarter
of 1987 and do not include unrealized gains of approximately $340
million from TWA's portfolio of marketable securites,'' a statement
said.
   Nearly $220 million of those gains occurred in the first
quarter, it added.
   The company said its $7.8 million first-quarter operating loss _
which compared with a $24.3 million operating loss in the same
period of 1987 _ ``was the best operating performance for TWA's
traditionally most unprofitable quarter in over 20 years.''
   Operating revenues totaled $920,225 in the three months ended
March 31, compared with $823,998 in the 1987 first quarter.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. and Kellog Co., two giant food companies, on Friday
reported improved first quarter earnings partly due to strong sales.
   Borden said its profit for the first three months of this year
climbed 19 percent, to $52.39 million, or $71 cents a share. That
compared with a net income of $44.03 million, or 60 cents a share,
a year ago.
   The New York company said sales totaled $1.6 billion, up 11.9
percent from $1.43 billion.
   Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., said it netted $121.1
million, or 98 cents per share, up 15.9 percent from earnings of
$104.5 million, or 85 cents a share.
   Sales during the period totaled $1.03 billion, vs. $896 million
last year.
   Borden, which makes a number of consumer food products as well
as professional products such as glue and paint, attributed its
results to strong sales and acquisitons.
   ``Acquisitions over the past year were a major factor in these
record figures, but we also benefited from improvements in our
ongoing businesses,'' Chairman R.J. Ventres said in a statement
prepared for Friday's stockholders meeting in Flemington, N.J.
   ``Margins were up slightly in dairy, our base U.S. snacks and
pasta businesses both posted higher sales and income, and overseas
our food joint venture in Spain and our chemical specialties units
did especially well.''
   Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said the increases reflect
continued international growth.
   ``Our heavy investment in marketing, research and development,
and the expansion and modernization of production facilities
continues to contribute to our growth,'' LaMothe said.
   He said the company also benefited from a lower tax rate.
   Kellogg manufactures a number of consumer food products,
including ready-to-eat cereals and other convenience foods.

<HEAD>Xerox Earnings Up 13 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. on Friday reported a 13
percent rise in its first quarter profit over a year ago, boosted
partly on the strength of its financial services unit.
   For the three months ended March 31, Xerox netted $152 million,
or $1.37 a share, compared with earnings of $135 million, or $1.25
a share, last year. Revenue also grew, to $3.8 billion from $3.4
billion.
   The company said revenue from its financial services division
totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, up from $1 billion in the 1987
quarter. Income in that division jumped 14 percent, to $88 million
from $78 million.
   Crum & Forster Inc., a property and casualty insurance
subsidiary, contributed $91 million in income, the company said.
Xerox Credit Corp. also was up, mainly from Xerox equipment
financing.
   Xerox said sales of business products and systems, including
computers, typewriters and copiers, grew by 9 percent, to $2.6
billion from $2.4 billion. But the company said currency exchange
rates accounted for about two-thirds of the increase.
   Income from that division totaled $64 million, up 12 percent
from $57 million.
   ``Continued emphasis on meeting customer requirements and
ongoing cost control should produce another good year for Xerox,
barring any major economic dislocation,'' Xerox Chairman David T.
Kearns said in a statement.
   Xerox President Paul A. Allaire said the company plans to
introduce several new products this year, including a new line of
copiers to be shown for the first time in the country on May 3.

<HEAD>Lotus Chairman Exercises His Options To Make $26.3 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last August, Lotus Development Corp.
chairman Jim P. Manzi exercised his options.
   The 36-year-old head of the nation's leading software and
personal computer maker bought 843,691 shares of company stock at a
price that realized a net value of $25,356,425, according to
company reports.
   Toss in his salary and bonuses, and Manzi made about $26.3
million in 1987, outpacing Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee Iacocca by
about $8.4 million on a list of top-paid executives compiled by
Business Week magazine.
   Some Wall Street analysts say Manzi simply was shrewd to take
advantage of a boom year for the computer company known for its
Lotus 1-2-3 software. But when Manzi turned around and sold a huge
chunk of stock six months later, he used the system to the
detriment of the average stockholder, they said.
   ``I think if companies are going to issue the amount of options
that Lotus does, then management should be proud to be a
shareholder in the company and not use the options to continually
cash in,'' said James M. Meyer, an analyst with Janney Montgomery
Scott Inc.
   Under the system of stock options, executives are given the
opportunity to buy company stock at a set market price. They can
exercise the option years afterward when the stock price may be
trading above the option price.
   They generally are used as incentives under the theory that if
an executive's performance rises, so will the company's value.
   ``In general I root for these executives who get big paychecks
from chasing in stock options,'' said Kevin J. Murphy, an economics
professor at the University of Rochester's William E. Simon
Business School.
   ``There has been a boom market that helps those firms a lot. By
far the best measure of performance is the stock price.''
   Manzi was given a lucrative package of compensation incentives
when he joined Lotus in 1983, a time when the company already was
succeeding. The former newspaper reporter became marketing director
and quickly rose to president in 1984.
   He exercised his stock options in a year that saw Lotus stock
jump 78 percent, ending the year at $30.75 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange. In February, Manzi said he sold 250,000 shares in
order to pay taxes on the options earnings.
   Lotus defended the sales by Manzi and other executives, which
preceded a drop in the company's earnings forecast and a delay in a
new version of its popular 1-2-3 electronic spreadsheet program.
   ``Jim Manzi is one of Lotus' largest shareholders and
substantially all of the gains he realized in 1987 from stock
options have been reinvested in the company,'' Robert Schechter,
Lotus' chief financial officer, said in a statement.
   ``His compensation ... reflects not just his 1987 compensation,
but more accurately an amount earned over four years when his
compensation package was assembled.''
   Critics of stock options say that lucrative compensation
packages often give executives a free ride if the stock market is
rising even if individual performance is sluggish.
   And if a company's gains already are high, executives may try to
preserve what they already have instead of investing anew, which
shareholders might prefer.
   ``For very senior managements at the corporate level, stock
options make lots of sense because what they do is link the
interests of top management with the owners of the firm,'' said
Alfred Rappaport, a Northwestern University accounting professor.
   But he added that ``having lots of stock options doesn't
necessarily make management as aggressive as shareholders would
like them to be in terms of ventures and new investments.''
   As for Manzi's $941,000 cash earnings, analysts said they're not
out of line _ even though Lotus is not a Fortune 500 company and it
reported a net income of $72 million last year.
   ``It's clearly a lot but (Lotus) has had some pretty spectacular
performances,'' said Gordon Wolf, vice president for executive pay
practice at the New York consulting firm of Towers Perrin Forster &
Crosby. ``If you really believe that paper performance is what it's
about, then when you make it you pay it.''

<TEXT>
   J.P. Stevens & Co. said Friday it rejected a
$1.22 billion takeover offer from rival bidders whose joint buyout
proposal includes splitting the textile giant's assets among them.
   A special committee of Stevens' board informed fabric maker West
Point-Pepperell Inc. and the investment firm Odyssey Partners that
their joint $68.50-a-share cash proposal was unacceptable in its
present form.
   The directors, who met late Thursday to review the proposal,
objected to conditioning the joint deal on Odyssey getting
financing and completing the purchase of about $530 million in
Stevens' assets.
   Instead, directors backed Odyssey's separate, outstanding
$68.50-a-share tender offer, which is due to expire at midnight
Tuesday and would assure a quick resolution to the takeover battle.
   A source close to the transaction said the joint proposal would
take longer to complete and could allow the principals to back out.
   Analysts were puzzled over why financing would be an issue,
since Odyssey already has received over $1 billion in commitments
to fund its own bid. Pepperell has a competing $67-a-share tender
offer outstanding which also expires Tuesday.
   The special committee said it would back the Pepperell-Odyssey
plan only if ``it had no conditions relating to the Odyssey asset
transaction.''
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens' stock closed
at $67.50 a share, unchanged from Thursday.
   Analysts speculated that Pepperell might have reached the upper
limit of its financing capacity and might need the proceeds from
the asset sale to Odyssey to clinch the deal.
   ``They might be running out of money,'' said Deborah Bronston, a
textile analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Odyssey and Pepperell, which bid against each other three times
in a heated auction, announced Tuesday that they were holding talks
about making a joint bid for Stevens.
   Odyssey had appeared to be playing the ``white knight'' role by
coming on the scene with a friendly offer after Pepperell had made
its first unsolicited offer. Now, however, Stevens ``feels it has
been stabbed in the back,'' said one analyst who asked not to be
named.
   One source close to the transaction said Odyssey ``feels they
owe some degree of loyalty to both sides.''
   Among the assets Odyssey likely would purchase were Stevens'
unfinished textile operations. The division sells about $235
million a year in unfinished fabrics and yarn.
   Separately, the attorneys general of New York and the Carolinas
have issued subpoenas to Pepperell, Odyssey and Bibb Co., which has
signed an agreement with Pepperell to purchase certain Stevens
assets.
   South Carolina Attorney General Travis Medlock said Thursday he
was concerned the three companies, in combining their efforts to
acquire Stevens, may have engaged in ``bid-rigging'' to determine
what price to pay for Stevens stock.
   Chris Braithwaite, a spokesman for New York Attorney General
Robert Abrams, said that ``two competing bidders talking about the
price and purchase of (Stevens) raises questions under state and
federal antitrust laws.'' The subpoenas seek documents and
testimony about ``alleged discussions concerning the acquisition of
Stevens,'' he said.
   Pepperell noted in a statement Friday that it has ``not been
accused of any (antitrust) violations, and we are confident
everything we have done is in accord with all applicable laws.''
   The West Point, Ga., textile company is making its bid for
Stevens in conjunction with NTC Group, the parent of textile
manufacturer Bibb.
   Pepperell has received Federal Trade Commission permission to
sell half of Stevens' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines
to NTC Group for about $170 million.
   Analysts agreed that Pepperell's interest in Stevens centers
exclusively on the company's sheet and towel operations, which
include manufacturing facilities as well as designer brand names.
Those operations account for 60 percent of Stevens' annual sales,
which amounted to $1.61 billion last year.
   Among the top brand names in Stevens' towel and sheet arsenal
are Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley, Gloria Vanderbilt, Perry Ellis,
Pierre Cardin and Givenchy, among others. Pepperell's brands
include Arrow, Martex, Lady Pepperell and Burberry.
   Separately, Stevens said Friday it planned to file a
counterclaim against Pepperell in Delaware Chancery Court charging
that Pepperell interfered with Stevens' existing merger agreement
with Odyssey.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.H. Robins Co. said Friday its earnings
declined 46 percent in the first three months of 1988, primarily
because of costs associated with its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case and
the company's pending merger with American Home Products Corp.
   Net earnings for the first quarter of 1988 amounted to $14.1
million, or 58 cents per share, down from $26 million, or $1.08 per
share, for the first three months of 1987.
   The company reported sales of $226.1 million, an 8 percent
increase over $209.8 million for the first quarter of last year.
   Operating earnings for the first quarter of 1988 totaled $48.1
million, up 1 percent from $47.8 million for the corresponding
period last year.
   Robins sought protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy
law in August 1985 in the wake of mounting claims by women who
alleged they were injured by the pharmaceutical company's Dalkon
Shield intrauterine birth control device.
   Robins' merger with American Home Products of New York has been
approved as part of its bankruptcy reorganization plan.

<HEAD>Chrysler to Move K-Car Production From Detroit to Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. says it will shift production of
all its Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant K-cars from the United
States to Mexico.
   Chrylser spokesman Steve Harris said Thursday that the move was
designed to make more room for assembly of the automaker's Dodge
Omni-Plymouth Horizon models in Detroit and a new mid-size car in
Newark, Del.
   Production of the Omni-Horizon models is being shifted at the
end of the 1988 model year to Detroit's Jefferson Avenue plant from
Chrysler's Kenosha, Wis., plant, at a cost of 5,500 jobs.
   The Jefferson Avenue and the Delaware plants now assemble
four-door versions of the Aries-Reliant models, known as K-cars,
while the two-door K-cars are assembled in Tolupa, Mexico.
   After September all K-cars will be assembled in Tolupa, Harris
said.
   ``It's just a matter of plant loadings,'' he said. ``There's
still a significant demand for the K-cars so we intend to produce
it. The market will determine the level of production.''
   United Auto Workers union leaders in Wisconsin said they were
angry over the move, which dashed hope that the Kenosha plant might
resume operation should demand for the Omni-Horizon models and
K-cars remain strong.
   ``Their scheme is now being exposed,'' said Rudy Kuzel, chief
bargainer for UAW Local 72 in Kenosha, which is negotiating with
Chrysler over terms of the shutdown. ``This is going to make it
much more difficult to get the contract settled.''
   The talks, which will shift to Detroit next week, involve
provisions for workers who will be laid off, as well as a contract
covering about 1,000 UAW members who will keep their jobs at
Chrysler's engine plant in Kenosha.
   ``I don't remember anybody in Mexico doing anything to save the
Chrysler Corporation,'' Kuzel said.``Born in America and moved to
Mexico.''

<HEAD>Dollar Moves Higher, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished slightly higher against most
major currencies Friday in the same light trading that
characterized dealings throughout the week.
   Gold prices fell sharply. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $449.50 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT,
down from $454.65 Thursday.
   Analysts said the dollar rose on technical factors. There was
virtually no reaction to the Commerce Department's report that
orders for durable goods were virtually unchanged last month.
   ``Basically the dollar has done nothing all day,'' said George
De Luna, a vice president and trader at Irving Trust Co.
   ``There's no reason for the dollar to break out of the current
levels _ the central banks have the markets very well under
control,'' he said.
   Traders said investors were concentrating their holdings in the
so-called high-yielding currencies, including the British pound.
   ``Sterling was a little softer, which prompted a little buying
of dollars,'' noted Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust
and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   In Europe, the dollar rose but trading was very sluggish. ``It
was a thin, poor day and you can't overglamorize the dollar's
move,'' said a London dealer.
   In Japan, where trading ends of Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 124.65 in Tokyo. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 124.85 yen. In New York, the dollar closed
at 124.915 yen, up from 124.27 yen on Thursday.
   The British pound cost $1.8880 in London late Friday, cheaper
for buyers than late Thursday's $1.8990. In New York it cost
$1.88405 to buy one pound, less expensive than Thursday's $1.8973.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.67575 West German marks, up from
1.66715; 1.38495 Swiss francs, up from 1.37675; 5.6845 French
francs, up from 5.6605; 1,244.50 Italian lire, up from 1,238.625,
and 1.23255 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23505.
   Other late dollar rates at in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6730 West German marks, up from
1.6660; 1.3840 Swiss francs, up from 1.3755; 5.6865 French francs,
up from 5.6550; 1.8770 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8675; 1,244.50
Italian lire, up from 1,238.50; and 1.2324 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2329.
   Gold prices closed lower after dipping through a support line of
around $450. Analysts attributed the drop to a stronger dollar and
higher stocks and bond prices.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $450.90 a
troy ounce, down from $455.40 on Thursday.
   In London, the metal's late bid price was $449 a troy ounce,
down from $454.50 quoted late Thursday. In Zurich, the late bid
price was also $449, down from $454.50 late Thursday. Earlier, in
Hong Kong, gold fell 13 cents to close at a bid $454.77.
   Silver finished at $6.405 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, down
from $6.450 on Thursday. In London, silver finished at a bid price
of $6.46 a troy ounce, equal to Thursday's $6.46.

<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The new federal rules banning smoking on flights under two hours
may send some inveterate smokers climbing the cabin walls, but
airlines and experts on smoking have been quick to offer advice.
   The American Institute for Preventive Medicine, for example, has
developed a kit called ``Flying Smokeless.''
   The institute, based in Southfield, Mich., runs quit-smoking and
other health programs at hospitals and businesses around the
companies. It's selling the kits _ a cassette tape and a
``smokeless emergency pack'' _ for $11.45.
   Dr. Don R. Powell, the group's executive director, says several
airlines have expressed interest in buying the program, including
Northwest, Eastern, American and Delta.
   The cassette ``teaches behavior modification techniques that
overcome the desire to smoke,'' the institute says, while the pack
contains cigarette substitutes such as sugarless gum, mints and
toothpicks.
   Other tips from Powell include putting a rubber band around the
wrist of your smoking hand and snapping it whenever a nicotine urge
strikes.
   United Airlines, which has been gearing up for the smoking ban
since April 13, offers some suggestions from its medical director,
Dr. Gary Kohn:
   _Put something in your mouth other than a cigarette. Chew gum.
Carry some celery or a carrot on a flight and munch on it. Inhale
on a straw or suck on a toothpick or cinnamon sticks. Carry breath
mints, throat lozenges or hard candies.
   _If you usually smoke while drinking coffee, soft drinks or
alcohol during flights, try switching to fruit juices, water or

   Orders to the nation's factories for ``big
ticket'' items remained strong in March, the government said
Friday, bolstering analysts' views that the economy is growing at a
healthy pace.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, were virtually unchanged,
rising less than 0.1 percent to $114.3 billion in March as a drop
in military hardware more than offset gains elsewhere.
   That was far less than the 1.3 percent advance most economists
were expecting. However, the government raised its estimate of new
orders in February. The revised report shows a 0.1 percent gain for
the month, rather than the previously reported 1.1 percent drop.
   The net result is a relatively strong level of orders through
the first quarter of this year, 7.9 percent above a year ago when
compared March to March.
   ``I would describe it as a ... picture that shows modest growth
in the economy, not a boom but no signs of a big dip,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   Roger Brinner, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm, said it is ``very premature''
to worry about sluggish growth in new orders because shipments
remain strong and the backlog in unfilled orders remains high.
   Nevertheless, the lower-than-expected results for March, along
with a stronger dollar overseas, helped both the bond and stock
markets, which have been depressed over fears of inflation and
higher interest rates.
   The key 30-year Treasury bond's price rose about $5 per $1,000
in face amount and its yield fell back under 9 percent. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.69 points to
2,015.09.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 2.6 percent last month to $113.3
billion after a 1.4 percent rise in February. The backlog of
unfilled orders was up 0.2 percent to $399.9 billion in March,
following a 1.0 percent rise the month before.
   ``A tremendous backlog has built up, so shipments will remain
high no matter how many new orders come in,'' Brinner said. ``...
If orders held flat for the rest of the year, you would still get a
very strong level of shipments compared to last year.''
   In March, a 3.0 percent drop in the volatile defense goods
category, to $8.3 billion, offset a 0.3 percent increase in orders
for non-defense goods, which rose to $106.0 billion.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel jumped 4.2 percent in
March after rising 0.9 percent in February. At $10.8 billion, they
stood 19.4 percent ahead of last year.
   There was also strength in transportation, primarily motor
vehicles and aircraft. This sector rose 2.5 percent to $31.3
billion, after a strong 5.5 percent boost in February.
   Orders for electrical machinery plummeted 4.7 percent to $18.6
billion, while non-electrical machinery edged down 0.2 percent to
$19.7 billion. However, orders in both categories remained 13
percent above a year ago.
   ``Smokestack U.S.A. is back. We've got strong growth in the
basic areas like steel. That's really pacing the economy now. The
problem is that growth might be too strong,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey G. Langston & Co., a government securities
dealer in New York.
   After the October stock market crash, analysts worried about a
slowdown in the economy during the first three months of this year.
However, they now are more concerned that too much demand could
increase inflation.
   Strong demand overseas for U.S. goods, spurred by the devalued
dollar, and a subsequent need by American manufacturers for
machinery are expected to keep the economy growing.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, which economists
consider a good indicator of factory expansion plans, was $33.3
billion in March, 20.1 percent higher than a year earlier.
   However, the most recent monthly numbers show a dip in orders _
a 1.3 percent decline in March and a 3.0 drop in February.

<HEAD>UAW's Stepp: Chrysler Actions Threaten Chance of Early Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union said
Friday that Chrysler Corp.'s decision to import the Dodge Aries and
Plymouth Reliant from Mexico next year threatens chances of an
early contract settlement and increases the likelihood of a strike.
   ``I hearby warn the Chrysler Corp. that if they cause these
negotiations to go in the ditch, the chances of a strike in
September would be 95 percent or better,'' UAW Vice President Marc
Stepp told a news conference.
   The flap is the latest of several since the opening Monday of
early national labor contract negotiations between the No. 3
automaker and the UAW. The contract covers at least 66,000 workers
in 15 states.
   Workers and union negotiators also were angered by the
compensation executives received in 1987. The figures, including
$17.9 million Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca received in salary,
cash and stock bonuses and exercised stock options, were revealed
in proxy statements mailed Tuesday.
   In addition, Stepp has said that despite Chrysler Vice President
Anthony St. John's assurances otherwise, Chrysler is trying to veer
sharply from an industry-pattern contract established at Ford Motor
Co. and General Motors Corp. last fall.
   St. John, Chrysler's chief bargainer, denied Chrysler is
transferring production of the soon-to-be discontinued
Aries-Reliant K-car to Mexico at the expense of American jobs.
Instead, he said production at an existing K-car plant in Toluca,
Mexico, will be boosted by 40,000 cars for one year while
Chrysler's two U.S. K-car plants are converted to making other
products.
   Ironically, Chrysler is selling the front-wheel-drive K-cars,
whose success saved Chrysler from bankruptcy in the early 1980s, as
``America series'' models.
   St. John said the total number of K-cars exported to the United
States _ 60,000 between Oct. 1, 1988 and Sept. 30, 1989 _ would be
enough to support only one third of one shift at either Chrysler's
Newark, Del., or Jefferson Avenue Detroit plant. Each plant can
build 235,000 cars a year using two shifts.
   The temporary increase in Toluca production will provide cars
primarily to fill fleet orders during the K-car phaseout, he said.
   Meanwhile, the venerable Omni-Horizon small car will be moved
into Jefferson Avenue from a former American Motors Corp. plant in
Kenosha, Wis. this summer and the Newark plant will begin building
the Spirit and Acclaim, the K-car's replacement. St. John said
Jefferson will employ as many or more workers making the
Omni-Horizon as it does now.
   Workers and government officials in Wisconsin were angered by
the announcement because they believed the Omni-Horizon could have
been kept at the 5,500-worker Kenosha plant, slated to close by
year's end, if the Jefferson plant continued to make the K-car.
   But Stepp said he understood that K-car production wouldn't be
high enough to support Jefferson. He said the company should keep
the K-car and build it on the same assembly line with the
Omni-Horizon, disagreeing with St. John's assertion that it wasn't
possible.
   The subject of importing cars from Mexico is a particularly sore
one at Chrysler because while the company emphasizes patriotism in
its advertising, it imports many of its cars, including all models
in its new Eagle lineup.
   At the same time, it is closing the Kenosha plant and tried to
sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary so it could
buy more from outside companies and low-wage foreign countries.
Chrysler U.S. workers earn $14.43 an hour. In Mexico, Chrysler
workers earn $2 to $2.50 an hour, said Chrysler spokesman Lloyd
Northard.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Plunge As Dollar Strengthens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices fell sharply Friday, surprising analysts and
extending the metal's decline over four days on New York's
Commodity Exchange to more than $9 a troy ounce.
   On other markets, pork belly futures plunged while livestock
futures were mixed; soybeans advanced while grains were mixed;
energy futures were mostly lower; and stock index futures advanced.
   Metals analysts said the stronger dollar may have had some
negative impact on precious metals markets but not enough to fully
explain the plunge in gold futures, which lost as much as $6.10 a
troy ounce during the session.
   ``I wasn't expecting a sell-off today of this sort of
magnitude,'' said Richard Levine, vice president of the metals and
foreign exchange group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Analyst Craig Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. said a
government report showing virtually no change last month in factory
orders for durable goods was somewhat disappointing, but also was
hardly enough to spark Friday's decline in metals.
   ``There's been no real negative news,'' he said. ``I guess
there's just been nothing exciting going on and the market has sold
off and just kind of fed on itself for a while.''
   Another analyst, Bernard Savakl of PaineWebber Inc., linked the
sell-off to talk of Japanese sales of platinum and government
concern over Taiwanese purchases of gold.
   Gold settled $4.50 to $6.10 lower with the contract for delivery
in June at $452.40 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 5.3 cents
lower with May at $6.415 a troy ounce.
   Pork belly futures plunged as much as 1.32 cents a pound on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange on expectations that a monthly
government report issued after the close would show a large
increase in the number of bellies in cold storage. The assumption
was correct.
   The Agriculture Department counted about 90.5 million pounds of
frozen pork bellies at the end of March, an increase of nearly 23.5
million pounds during the month and the third-largest March 31
total on record.
   Analyst Chuck Levitt said the report would have little market
impact since it matched expectations.
   But two other USDA reports issued Friday _ the monthly and
quarterly cattle-on-feed reports _ will likely send cattle futures
50 to 100 points lower on Monday, Levitt said.
   The quarterly report showed a 6 percent increase since last year
in the total number of cattle being fattened for slaughter, a 2
percent rise in placements on feedlots during the first quarter and
a 1 percent increase in cattle marketings.
   The monthly report also showed greater-than-expected numbers of
cattle on feed, higher-than-expected placements and
lower-than-expected marketings.
   ``No matter how you cut it, first quarter placements appear to
be the largest on record and that has to take some kind of toll in
the marketplace,'' Levitt said.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with June
at 70.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .48 cent
higher with April at 79.97 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower
to .23 cent higher with June at 48.75 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .60 cent to 1.32 cents lower with May at 52.02 cents a
pound.
   Soybean futures closed sharply higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade as weather forecasters reduced their predictions for next
week's rainfall. The grains were mixed.
   Long-range forecasts issued Thursday predicted good amounts of
rain next week in the Midwest and Great Plains, where corn and
soybean planting is beginning and rain is needed to get the crops
off to a good start. Prices fell Thursday in reaction to the
forecasts.
   But new forecasts Friday predicted lesser amounts of rain, and
the markets rallied on the news, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $3.15 a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 1} cents higher with May at
$2.01\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with May
at $1.64{ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 6{ cents higher with
May at $6.63{ a bushel.
   Energy futures settled mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in nervous trading ahead of next week's meeting of OPEC
and non-OPEC oil producers, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 6 cents
lower with June at $18.30 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent lower
to .11 cent higher with May at 50.60 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .16 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 52.29
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures posted strong gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 5.65 points higher at 261.85.

<HEAD>Short-Term Thinking Hurts Competitiveness, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Short-term thinking is hurting the United
States' ability to compete in world markets, according to a survey
of leaders in corporate research, universities and state government
that was released Friday.
   The survey was sponsored by the Conference Board, a
business-supported research group, as well as the National
Governors' Association and the National Science Foundation.
   People surveyed in all parts of the country said innovation was
being blocked by corporate leaders' lack of long-term goals,
coupled with a lack of the needed tax incentives.
   The leaders also said schools need better science, engineering
and math education, while colleges need better equipment. Business
executives emphasized the need for continued training on the job.
   Slightly more than half of the business people who responded
said they did not think cooperative research between industries and
universities would have a critical impact on U.S. competitiveness.
   More than half the business leaders said the federal budget
deficit leads the list of fiscal and monetary issues that hurt the
nation's competitiveness. Three-quarters of the state government
and university leaders felt the same way.
   The survey was conducted in the winter and spring of 1987 and
covered 2,300 senior corporate research and development officials,
500 university leaders, and state officials in all 50 states.

<HEAD>Feds on Boesky's Sentence: 3 Years Was Fair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors insisted Friday that Ivan F. Boesky
got a fair punishment for his crimes, despite the convicted
speculator's plea for more leniency from a judge who sentenced him
to three years imprisonment.
   Boesky, the disgraced stock speculator at the center of a major
insider trading scandal, asked U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker
late last week to reduce his sentence for conspiracy to violate
securities law.
   Boesky, who could have been sentenced to a maximum five years,
said through his lawyers that he deserves milder treatment because
he has provided prosecutors with additional evidence on ``new
topics, new transactions, new relationships and new securities.''
   That disclosure indicated Boesky is now giving evidence about
people he hadn't implicated in earlier statements to prosecutors
before his sentencing.
   Lasker sentenced Boesky in December. The speculator began
serving his sentence at a minimum security prison at Lompoc, Calif.
last month and will be eligible for parole after one year.
   In a two-page affidavit responding to Boesky's request,
Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said Boesky is continuing
to cooperate and ``the government's investigations relating to
information he has provided continues.''
   But Carrol also maintained that ``in the government's view,
Boesky's three-year sentence was and remains an appropriate
sentence in light of all the competing factors.''
   In his 35-page affidavit requesting sentence reduction, Boesky
lawyer Leon Silverman asked Lasker to delay ruling until October,
by which time ``the extraordinary extent and value of Mr. Boesky's
cooperation will become even more evident.''
   Carrol also agreed that Lasker should delay ruling until October.
   Boesky was a leading speculator in the stocks of potential
takeover targets when he rocked Wall Street in November 1986 by
agreeing to pay $100 million to settle civil insider trading
charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In addition to settling the civil case without admitting guilt,
Boesky also agreed to plead guilty to the single felony count and
has been cooperating since then with prosecutors.

<HEAD>GM Says Cost Cuts Will Top $12.5 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A four-year belt-tightening program at General
Motors Corp. could save more than $12.5 billion by 1990, up from
previous estimates of $10 billion, GM officials told auto industry
analysts Friday.
   A wider profit margin as well as a bigger share of the auto
market are keys to reaching a 15 percent return on common
stockholder equity by that time, GM Chairman Roger Smith told GM's
1988 Automotive Security Analysts meeting in New York.
   GM President Robert C. Stempel told the group 1987 was a
transition year for the company.
   ``Sales and market share rebounded strongly in the first quarter
of 1988 compared with the last quarter of 1987,'' Stempel said.
   He said orders have been strong for the new Buick Regal,
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix mid-sized coupes.
   GM will be cutting under-used production capacity so that by
1992 it approaches 100 percent of the capacity of remaining newer,
more efficient plants to meet expected demand, Stempel said.
   And he said the company will cut its array of models and
options, using more shared components for similarly sized vehicles.
   Alan Smith, chief financial officer, said GM's ``action plan'' _
designed to cut costs by $10 billion through efficiency and
productivity improvements from 1987-1990 _ saved $3.7 billion in
1987 rather than the $3 billion expected in the first year.
   ``Based on our strong cost-containment efforts to date, and the
steps we are now taking, our revised outlook for cumulative 1990
cost savings amounts to between $12.5 billion and $13 billion,''
Smith said.
   The financial officer said a production facility modernizing
program is nearly complete and total spending on that will decline
to about $7 billion this year and $6 billion in 1990, down from
$11.7 billion in 1986.
   Stempel said GM-United Auto Workers union teams are working to
improve roductivity at GM's parts plants, with studies expected to
be completed by September. ``We're working very hard with our
unions on the question of outsourcing noncompetitive products,'' he
said.
