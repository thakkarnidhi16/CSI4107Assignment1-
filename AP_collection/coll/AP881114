   An undertaker who grappled with an airline
stewardess when she told him to stop smoking was ordered Monday to
spend 15 days in prison by a judge who said he wants to protect the
flying public.
   James J. Tabacca, 34, who was convicted of interfering with a
flight crew, said he never meant to upset anyone and pleaded for
probation.
   But U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima said he wanted Tabacca's
sentence to have a deterrent effect on other passengers who might
take the law into their own hands.
   He then imposed a suspended sentence of 18 months with the
provision that Tabacca spend 15 days behind bars. His attorney was
given three weeks to appeal, and Tabacca was ordered to report to a
federal prison Dec. 4.
   Tabacca also was placed on two years' probation, fined $500 and
ordered to perform 100 hours of community service in restitution to
the public.
   The confrontation Dec. 30 on a TWA flight from Boston to Los
Angeles occurred when flight attendant Pamela Martinez tried to stop
Tabacca from lighting a cigarette in the no-smoking section of the
jetliner.
   Tabacca's ticket was for the smoking section, but most seats on
the flight were converted to non-smoking because of government
regulations requiring airlines to provide no-smoking seats for all
passengers who arrive on time and want them.
   Tabacca twisted Ms. Martinez' arm and shoved her across the aisle
into the bulkhead, shouting obscenities at her when she tried to
stop him from smoking, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin Scroggie.
   A jury convicted him Sept. 6 of interfering with a flight crew
but acquitted him of assault.
   He had faced a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   ``For the safety of the flying public, it is necessary that all
passengers abide by the law of flying conduct and not take the law
into their own hands,'' Tashima said.
   ``Because of the nature of the offense and the public nature of
the offense, some custody time is required,'' he told Tabacca.
   The defendant, an undertaker from North Hollywood, pleaded for
leniency.
   ``Sincerely, I am sorry that such an incident has ever taken
place,'' he said. ``I can't believe this has happened to me. I never
meant any interruption or to upset anyone. My family and I have
suffered greatly from this.''
   Deputy Public Defender Kerry Bensinger suggested that prison time
was an excessive penalty.
   ``Mr. Tabacca is now a convicted felon,'' he said. ``His name has
been published in the papers. ... We believe that is all the
punishment Mr. Tabacca needs to receive.''

<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl honored Simon
Wiesenthal at the Nazi hunter's 80th birthday party Monday and
warned against minimizing Nazi crimes through comparison with other
killings.
   ``We Germans have to live with the terrible fact that under the
National Socialist (Nazi) tyranny untold suffering was inflicted on
the Jews in particular,'' Kohl said.
   He called the crimes ``a genocide without any example.''
   Kohl said that there were attempts to compare Nazi crimes with
the suffering of other people persecuted for political convictions
or religious faith.
   ``Yet anyone who uses this line of argument overlooks or denies
that the hatred for the Jews was deeper: the mere fact that someone
was of Jewish descent constituted a capital crime,'' Kohl said.
   ``Our century is not only marked by economic, social, scientific
and technologial change that was scarcely conceivable beforehand, it
will also enter history as an era in which war and genocide brought
forth new unimaginable atrocities,'' Kohl said.
   ``There is a collective guilt. ... There is a common
responsibility for ensuring that history does not repeat itself,''
he said.
   Wiesenthal thanked Kohl for his friendship and ``appreciation of
my work.''
   ``Your presence here tonight is proof of your willingness to
honor all those who did not live to see the day of liberation from
the Nazi rule,'' Wiesenthal said.
   ``You definitely do not belong to that group that simply wants to
put history behind them, on the contrary, you have always spoken
about the responsibility for everything that was committed in the
name of the Germans,'' he said.

   The black bird that became a man's obsession
in one of the greatest movie crime dramas can now perch on top of
any latter-day Sam Spade's desk.
   There it is, the gold and jewel-encrusted Maltese Falcon,
bestowed on Charles V by the Crusaders in tribute for the king's
bestowal of the island of Malta. The bird captured by pirates and
taken to Paris, where it was found in an obscure antiques shop, its
riches hidden by black paint. The bird that became the passion of
Kaspar Gutman and bound together Sam Spade, Joel Cairo, Brigid
O'Shaugnessy and Wilmer Cook in a drama of greed and obsession.
   Except that this Maltese Falcon actually comes to your doorstep
from Mercerville, N.J., where sculptor Clifton J. Sheely makes $45
reproductions of the object from the 1941 Humphrey Bogart movie
``The Maltese Falcon.''
   ``I was sitting at home one night watching the movie, and I
thought, `My God, wouldn't this be great for people to have?''' he
said.
   ``It has this mystique about it.''
   Sheely, 31, of Mercerville, who teaches at the Johnson Technical
School of Sculpture, spent 2{ weeks sculpting a clay prototype. He
modeled the 10-inch-high bird from movie stills, measuring the
dimensions by comparing its image to the hand of Bogart, who holds
it in a picture.
   Sheely made a rubber mold of the bird, into which he pours a type
of gypsum cement. Then comes a coating with black lacquer. When it
is shipped, the bird is accompanied by a history drawn from the
movie and is wrapped in newspaper and twine, just as it arrives in
the film.
   Sheely, who has his own decorative sculpting business, said he
has sold about 100 birds in the past month since an advertisement
appeared in a film buff's magazine.
   He also offers a $250 bronze version.
   Who buys the black bird? Die-hard fans of Bogie and the movie,
equally divided between men and women, Sheely said.
   One customer told Sheely that he used to watch the movie together
with his father and knows all the dialogue. The customer's father
died several months ago.
   ``He just wanted to buy it as a remembrance,'' Sheely said.
   In the Dashiell Hammett novel and John Huston-directed film,
private eye Spade, played by Bogart, is drawn into the feverish
attempts by Gutman _ actor Sydney Greenstreet _ to acquire the
falcon.
   When Gutman's search ends and he finally has the bird in hand, he
exclaims, ``By Gad, sir, now, after 17 years!''
   But it turns out to be as fake as Sheely's.
   ``It's not just any old black bird,'' said Louise Duus, a Rutgers
University associate dean and professor of American studies
specializing in popular culture.
   People are drawn to Sheely's bird out of a sense of nostalgia for
``an age, a model, an ideal,'' she said.
   But could there be a deeper reason?
   The movie is about ``fraud, and greed, and all those things we
say we're against,'' Ms. Duus said.
   Perhaps people are attracted to Sheely's falcon ``as a way of
laughing at yourself if you're greedy,'' she said. But, in the end,
maybe the bird's appeal can't be pinned down.
   ``It's like the pet rock. How do you explain these things?'' she
said.

<HEAD>Quayle Likely To Be Odd Man Out In Bush White House, Pundits Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the
outside'' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential
candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts
say.
   Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy
of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies,
Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or
allies.
   Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas,
Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional
ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _
rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had,
some scholars feel.
   ``Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a
decade or more. One thing that political scientists have been
talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown. ...
With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics
and funerals,'' said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of political
science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies the
American presidency.
   Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the
campaign. When asked, Bush employed the stock lines that Quayle
would ``make an outstanding vice president'' and had been ``tempered
by steel'' as he weathered the early furor over his military
service, academic record and personal life.
   The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to
the same papers, information and intelligence that is available to
the president. But he would go no further in describing what
assignments he would give Quayle.
   Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council,
and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration's
anti-drug efforts. ``I will be a very close adviser to the
president,'' Quayle said.
   But that's not the way everyone sees it.
   Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns
with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in
important positions in the respective presidential campaigns,
Barilleaux notes.
   ``Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the
Bush campaign. He doesn't have his own big reputation on Capitol
Hill. ... Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except
George Bush,'' Barilleaux says.
   ``They're going to give him a lot of window dressing, a space
council, drug task force, but he's going to be a man on the outside
... not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis, except on a
pro forma basis.''
   But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bush
campaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role in
the administration than he had in the campaign.
   ``Vindication demands that. Both of them will want to prove how
right the decision was,'' Mahe says.
   Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight,
a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested and
unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Even some
members of Quayle's own party were dismayed at Bush's choice.
   Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated
gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbled
explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I didn't live in
this century.''
   Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, says
Quayle, while ``not the world's leading intellectual,'' is not ``a
complete dummy.'' He was simply thrust into a situation for which he
was unprepared, Ornstein says.
   ``I think he's immature. He's not stupid,'' Ornstein says.
   But Quayle comes to the White House with ``a very damaging
stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the
political community and that's believed by a large segment of the
electorate,'' Ornstein says.
   ``That's going to give him a good deal to overcome. It's going to
give him an enormous impetus to prove himself. That's going to be
difficult, given the office.''
   Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution see
parallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon and
Spiro Agnew. The choice of Nixon was viewed as a move by Dwight
Eisenhower to appease the party's right wing, and Agnew was seen as
a political nonentity.
   ``The natural response is to use him (Quayle) sparingly, as Nixon
did with Agnew in 1968,'' Hess says. ``However, Quayle has four
years to prove himself, and I think you're going to see stories in
two years about how much he's learned, how much he's acted
responsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988.''
   Quayle admits the campaign was a learning process. After the
controversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence from his
Bush handlers, saying he would be his own man. He became more
accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule
handed down from Washington and to deliver the party's scripted
message. Soon, he dropped off the front pages.
   And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having
little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national
news, he played the role of loyal No. 2 and even trumpeted his new
anonymity.
   ``We have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential
nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the
pages at all. That's what we're supposed to be,'' he told reporters.
   That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a
Bush White House, Mahe feels, since Bush wants ``a private adviser,
whose experience and opinion he respected ... (who) has never had
another agenda.''
   ``Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man
alone,'' Mahe says. ``You're never going to see Dan Quayle telling
tales out of school.''

<HEAD>New Ship Communications Signal End Of Morse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World shipping leaders have given the go-ahead for
the introduction of new, automatic communications that will mean the
end of the Morse code for ships at sea.
   The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System transmits and
receives automatically, so Morse will no longer be a requirement for
ships. Shipowners are expected to phase out radio operators when the
new equipment is installed in ships, starting in 1993.
   Some parts of the new technology, which includes satellite
communications, are already in use on British ships and from 1999
they will be compulsory on ships worldwide.
   The decision was taken Friday during a two-week London conference
of the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency
for the safety of shipping and preventing ships polluting the seas.
   The 66 countries represented accounted for about 97 percent of
the world's ships, said spokesman Roger Kohn.
   A statement afterward called the decision ``one of the biggest
advances in maritime communications since the introduction of
radio.''
   The new system allows the crew to send a distress signal by
pushing a button, which should prevent ships disappearing without a
trace when messages cannot be sent in time.
   Ships will also carry a radio beacon, which will give the ship's
position and must be able to float free if the ship sinks suddenly.
   Kohn said: ``Morse has great romantic connotations with the
gallant radio operator sending off distress calls as the ship sinks.
But we are bringing in something that will be much better and which
should save even more lives.''
   The Morse code, invented by American Samuel Morse and first used
in 1844, has been the foundation of ship's distress and safety
messages since the turn of the century. It is a series of long and
short electronic ``dots and dashes'' representing letters of the
alphabet.
   Morse code was used to inform an incredulous world that the
supposedly unsinkable oceanliner Titanic was sinking in the North
Atlantic in 1912. The Titanic sank swiftly and 1,500 people perished.

   Former attorney general John N. Mitchell was
laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery after a service attended
by former President Richard Nixon and many members of his
administration.
   Mitchell, who won the Silver Star for gallantry in the World War
II Navy, was buried with full military honors on Saturday, three
days after he suffered a heart attack on a Washington street and
died.
   A neighboring grave holds the remains of Gregory ``Pappy''
Boyington, a Medal of Honor winner whose life Mitchell is credited
with saving, and nearby are the graves of heavyweight boxing
champion Joe Louis, actor Lee Marvin and Maxwell D. Taylor, a
four-star general.
   Nixon escorted Mitchell's longtime companion, Mary Gore Dean,
down the aisle at St. Alban's Church but did not take part in the
service. The pallbearers included Mitchell's five grandsons by two
children from his first marriage.
   Among the mourners was Robert Mardian, one of Mitchell's
co-defendants in the Watergate cover-up trial in which Mitchell was
convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice. He became the first
attorney general to go to prison, serving 19 months of a 2{-to-8
year sentence.
   H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, Nixon's top lieutenants in
the White House, did not attend the funeral. Nixon was one of 18
unindicted co-conspirators in the Watergate scandal.
   There was only one reference to the scandal that brought the
Nixon administration down.
   ``What he went through was the most unfair, cruel treatment of a
public figure in the history of this cynical city,'' said former
Nixon aide Richard A. Moore in the eulogy.
   ``It is said that you judge a man by the friends he makes and the
friends he keeps,'' said Moore. ``He made friends in every phase of
his life, in law, in government, in politics, in Washington and in
New York. John was not one who attracted fair-weather friends.''

<TEXT>
   Schools, museums, librarians, prominent
politicians and even a television quiz show are teaming up this week
to draw attention to the need to know where we _ and others _ are.
   A variety of programs are planned for ``Geography Awareness
Week'' in the United States, a land of people who came from other
places.
   ``Without geographically literate citizens, America cannot
compete in global markets or take the lead in meeting international
political, economic, environmental, social and military
challenges,'' said Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the National
Geographic Society.
   Yet Americans' ignorance is illustrated by a recent Gallup survey
which found that 18- to 24-year-old Americans know less about world
geography than residents of other nations do.
   _Less than half could find Central America on a map.
   _Only one in three could locate Vietnam.
   _Just one-quarter could find the Persian Gulf.
   _And when asked to locate New York state on a map, respondents
picked 37 different places across the nation.
   ``Continued ignorance of geography, other cultures, and foreign
languages places the United States at a disadvantage in matters of
business, politics and the environment,'' says Sen. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J.
   How to solve the problem?
   The National Geographic Society, the Association of American
Geographers, educators, librarians and others are giving it a try.
   Perhaps with the potential to reach the most people quickly is
the quiz show ``Jeopardy,'' which will include special geography
categories during the week.
   National Geographic Society head Grosvenor and U.S. Education
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos will teach a geography class in Dallas,
Texas. Several state governors will serve as honorary teachers
during the week.
   In many cities, weathercasters will include a bit of extra
geography in their broadcasts during the week, as well as lecturing
in local schools.
   Grosvenor also announced that his society will donate a copy of
its new Historical Atlas of the United States to every school in the
nation with a ninth grade or higher.
   The Census Bureau, which spends lots of time worrying about where
people are, will send workers to a dozen or more schools in the
Washington area to make classroom presentations on maps and
locations.
   The geography of environmental hazards will be the focus of
lectures at Western Washington University in Bellingham, the
University of Maryland in College Park, Villanova University, in
Villanova, Pa., Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. and others.
   At George Mason University in Virginia, the geography of the
spread of the disease AIDS will be reported by geographer William B.
Wood of the State Department.
   T-shirts celebrating the week will be on sale from the Geography
Club at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and by students at
Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C.
   At Montana State University in Bozeman a ``bake sale of
geographic delights'' is planned, while a high school in Louisville,
Ky., has created cookie cutters in the shape of states and will hold
a decorating contest to add appropriate topographic features.
   Science will make room for the arts also, as students at Ball
State in Muncie, Ind., explore the ``geographical perspectives of
bluegrass music,'' and the Texas Alliance for Geographic Education
holds a statewide poster contest with judging scheduled at Southwest
Texas State in San Marcos.

<HEAD>Judge Expected To Decide Who Gets To Buy Remains of PTL Empire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a year and a half after PTL filed
for bankrupty reorganization, a judge is expected to decide this
week who gets what's left of the religious empire.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds may choose from four bids
for the theme park and other property near Fort Mill, about 70 miles
north of Columbia.
   Two bids, considered serious, are from Canadians Stephen Mernick
and Peter Thomas; two other bids came from groups known as ``Lexalt
University'' and ``Holy Celebration.''
   Lawyers for the bidders, creditors, PTL contributors, and people
still involved in the ministry and concerned about its future are
planning to pack the courtroom for the hearing Wednesday.
   ``I've been calling it a potential zoo,'' PTL lawyer R. Bradford
Leggett said late last week.
   PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton predicted the hearing will
continue at least until Thursday. But he expects a buyer will be
chosen.
   ``It's a matter of finances,'' Benton said. ``It has to be sold.''
   PTL filed for protection from its creditors in June 1987, three
months after founder Jim Bakker admitted having a sexual encounter
with church secretary Jessica Hahn and stepped aside.
   The Bakkers tried to buy the assets, but their bid fell through.
They are now trying to raise money for a new TV ministry.
   Earlier this month, Reynolds ordered the Bakkers and a former top
aide to pay $7.7 million to PTL, who filed a lawsuit against them.
The judge determined the Bakkers and the aide were overpayed during
their last four years with the ministry.
   Last summer the television ministry was separated in a non-profit
organization known as Heritage Ministries. The remaining for-profit
organization, including the theme park, hotel and shopping mall at
Heritage USA, has been under the court's guidance pending the sale.
   The future of Heritage Ministries and of the Heritage Village
Church based at Heritage USA depends largely on which buyer is
chosen.
   Thomas of Samoth Capital Corp. in Vancouver, British Columbia,
has submitted a $113 million bid. He has said he would keep the
theme park's family orientation and would consider allowing the
ministry and church to lease facilities and stay at Heritage USA.
   Mernick, a Toronto businessman who has offered $115 million, has
not said whether he would allow the ministry and church to stay.
Benton recommended in October that Mernick be allowed to buy the
assets.
   The $116 million bid from Lexalt University was made by the Rev.
Edward J. Brown of Atlanta, who has said no university actually
exists. He has said he would return Bakker to Heritage USA.
   The fourth bid was for $120 million by a Christian business
association known as Holy Celebration. Its trustees are Herbert T.
Nelson, a lawyer from Greenbelt, Md., and Sandi Kalez of Seattle.
   Benton said he has yet to see proof that the Lexalt or Holy
Celebration groups can back their offers. He called the Mernick and
Thomas bids the only viable offers so far.
   Terry Steen, chief financial officer for Heritage Ministries,
said the 135 people who work for the television ministry and church
and the 250 workers remaining at the for-profit operations at
Heritage USA are anxiously awaiting a decision on a buyer.
   But, he added, ``We've gone through so many deadlines in the last
18 to 20 months that we're kind of immune to it.''

   Voter turnout fell in all but two states in
this year's presidential election from four years ago and voters in
12 states cast more ballots in statewide races for senator and
governor than in the race for president, a research group says.
   Overall, 91.3 million Americans _ half of those eligible to vote
_ cast ballots in the presidential race. Turnout declined in 48
states and the District of Columbia from the 1984 election, said the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
   The turnout was the lowest since 1924, when an estimated 48.9
percent of eligible Americans voted, the nonpartisan research group
said.
   Except for a slight increase in 1984, national turnout has
declined steadily since 1960, when 62.8 percent of eligible voters
cast ballots, according to the committee's study. This year's
turnout was down from 92.7 million, or 53.1 percent of eligible
voters who cast ballots in 1984.
   Continuation of the trend ``will pose a serious threat to the
political health of the American nation,'' Curtis Gans, director of
the committee, said Sunday.
   Turnout dropped from 1984 by more than 1 percentage point in 46
states and the District of Columbia, and by 0.9 percent in Colorado
and 0.5 percent in Nebraska. It rose in two states _ Nevada by 1.9
percentage points and New Hampshire by 0.7 percentage points.
   Some political analysts blame the declining turnout on
registration procedures that present barriers to voting, but Gans
said the study found registration was not the problem.
   In North Dakota, which does not require voters to register,
turnout has declined 17.4 percentage points since 1960, compared
with a national decline of 12.8 percentage points during the same
period, according to the study.
   In Wisconsin and Minnesota, both of which established election
day registration in 1976, turnout has dropped below what it was in
1972 before the same-day registration began.
   Also, while Nevada, Colorado, Arizona and the District of
Columbia had significant increases in registration this year, only
Nevada of the three had a higher turnout than in 1984, the committee
said.
   ``The problem isn't registration,'' he said. ``While easing of
registration procedures might help some, the problem is the conduct
of our campaigns ... the decline of political parties, the rise of
political consultants and the abuse of television advertising.''
   Gans also said the partisan turnout figures show ``the Republican
revolution is running out of steam and that what slim hopes they
have had for a realignment in their favor will depend very strongly
on the success of the Bush presidency.''
   Republican turnout fell five percentage points nationally,
dropping in every state and the District of Columbia from the 1984
election, he said. Democratic turnout, however, was up 0.9
percentage points from the previous election, gaining in 38 states
and dropping in 12 and the District of Columbia, he said.
   Gans said the committee's estimate of a 50 percent turnout of
eligible voters this year is based on incomplete tallies in some
places, but he believes the final number will be within two-tenths
of a percentage point of his estimate.
   Turnout was lowest in the District of Columbia, where 36.6
percent of the eligible voters cast ballots, followed by South
Carolina with 38.2 percent; Georgia, 38.3 percent; Hawaii, 42.6
percent; and Alaska, 42.8 percent.
   The highest turnout was in Minnesota, where 65.3 percent voted
for president, followed by Wisconsin, 61.3 percent; South Dakota,
61.1 percent; Montana, 61.0 percent; and Maine, 61.0 percent.
   Turnout of registered voters also has been steadily declining,
except for an increase in 1976. This year, an estimated 70.5 percent
of registered voters cast ballots in the presidential election.
   The study also said that in 12 states, more people voted in
statewide races for Senate and governor than in the presidential
race this year. Those states were: Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Utah,
Vermont, Washington and Wyoming.
   Turnout rates for other states were:
   North Dakota, 60.9 percent; Utah, 58.8; Iowa, 58.4; Vermont,
58.2; Idaho, 57.2; Connecticut, 57.1; Massachusetts, 56.7; Nebraska,
55.2; Missouri, 54.6; Ohio, 54.5; Colorado, 54.2; New Hampshire,
53.7; Michigan, 53.6; Kansas, 53.3; Oregon, 53.3; Illinois, 52.4;
Indiana, 52.4; Rhode Island, 50.6; Louisiana, 50.3.
   Also: New Jersey, 50.1; Wyoming, 49.5; Pennsylvania, 49.4;
Mississippi, 48.9; Oklahoma, 48.3; Washington, 48.1; Kentucky, 47.7;
Virginia, 47.7; Delaware, 47.0; Maryland, 46.7; West Virginia, 46.3;
New York, 46.0; Arkansas, 45.9; New Mexico, 45.2; Alabama, 45.1;
Tennessee, 44.2; California, 44.1; Arizona, 43.9; Texas, 43.6;
Nevada, 43.4; Florida, 43.4; North Carolina, 43.2.

   Concluding 7{ years as the Reagan
administration's point man on civil rights, William Bradford
Reynolds is leaving government the same way he came in: as a target
of civil rights groups and a champion of conservatives.
   Reynolds is resigning effective Dec. 9 from the job of assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's civil rights
division. He served longer in the post than anyone else.
   ``One can only hope it's the end of an era,'' said William Taylor
of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, who is an adjunct
professor at Georgetown University law school and a former director
of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
   The post of civil rights chief in the Justice Department
traditionally has carried with it a certain set of expectations.
   Until 1981, the head of the division had been someone on whom
civil rights leaders usually could rely to reflect their views. All
of that changed when Reynolds arrived.
   ``The NAACP would like the Justice Department'' civil rights
division ``to be an arm of the NAACP,'' said Clint Bolick, a former
special assistant to Reynolds and now director of the Landmark
Center for Civil Rights, a conservative litigating organization.
   ``When he believes a civil rights violation has occurred, there's
never been a more tenacious enforcer of the law than Brad Reynolds,
but if he believes a violation has been cured or if there's no
discrimination, he will not use the arm of the government to
effectuate somebody else's agenda and that's what really rankles
them,'' said Bolick.
   The Reagan administration has sought an end to affirmative action
hiring and promotion programs and to forced busing to achieve school
desegregation.
   Neither goal has been realized by the administration but by
raising these and other issues over and over again in court briefs,
speeches, and interviews, Reynolds has reopened debate on matters
which the civil rights movement thought had been settled long ago.
   ``Laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, voting,
education, housing and the funding of federal programs all were the
targets of Mr. Reynolds' attempts to turn back the clock on civil
rights enforcement,'' said Ralph Neas, executive director of the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. ``Fortunately a bipartisan
Congress and the Supreme Court repeatedly rejected the extremism of
the Meese-Reynolds Department of Justice.''
   But conservative Patrick McGuigan of the Free Congress Foundation
said Reynolds has ``an absolute intensity and dedication to
eradicating real instances of racial bias ... and yet has had to
suffer the likes of (Sen. Arlen) Specter questioning his commitment
to civil rights.''
   Specter, R-Pa., cast a key vote against Reynolds' nomination as
associate attorney general, the No. 3 job in the Justice Department.
The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected his nomination. Reynolds was
accused of failing to enforce civil rights laws and of lying to the
committee, accusations he denied.
   The theme sounded constantly by Reynolds during his tenure at the
Justice Department was that affirmative action goals and timetables,
whether instituted in the private sector or among federal
contractors, have all too frequently become rigid hiring quotas.
   Instead of mandatory busing to achieve school desegregation,
Reynolds favored use of magnet school programs to attract students
from all parts of a school system. Bolick said that approach has
worked ``breathtakingly well,'' but civil rights groups say such
steps have usually been inadequate to desegregate schools.
   However, even civil rights lawyers such as Morris Dees of the
Southern Poverty Law Center give Reynolds and his division high
marks in at least one area.
   ``The Reagan Justice Department has done a better job enforcing
the civil rights laws against racial violence than any
administration that I've dealt with in the past 30 years,'' Dees, a
critic of the administration's policies on affirmative action and
other issues, said in a speech last March in New York City at a
regional conference on prejudice and violence.
   In an interview Friday, Dees also praised Reynolds personally for
having his division move aggressively against incidents of police
brutality aimed at minorities.

<TEXT>
   Two decades after Soviet tanks stopped his
``Prague Spring'' reforms, Alexander Dubcek says Czechoslovakia is
in such a sore state that it has no choice but to launch another
drive for democracy.
   Wiping away tears, the 66-year-old Dubcek received an honorary
degree Sunday for the efforts that provoked the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia and his ouster as the country's Communist
Party leader.
   His trip to Italy to accept the political science degree from the
University of Bologna was his first outside Czechoslovakia in 18
years. During those years he lived in obscurity, holding a routine
administrative job in the forestry department in Bratislava.
   After receiving his degree and a minute of thunderous applause,
Dubcek read excerpts of his 11{-page acceptance speech, in which he
denounced the 1968 invasion of his country and the hardline
government the Soviets installed.
   ``It is my firm conviction that without the external intervention
in the situation of our party and our Czechoslovak society, our
endeavor would have been crowned with success,'' he said in the
speech.
   Saying that now ``every form of dialogue is virtually barred'' in
Czechoslovakia, Dubcek declared in his native Slovak that his nation
cannot help but push for democracy.
   Just last week, Communist authorities arrested more than a dozen
dissidents in Prague, according to the opposition.
   ``In 1968, there was a process of democratization, with words and
acts, before the eyes of all the people,'' Dubcek said in his speech.
   ``Today it is not possible to do anything else. So much more
because the 20 years that have passed'' have been marked by
``economic stagnation, sterility and incalculable moral losses.''
   Dubcek told Italian state television in an interview broadcast
Sunday night that he ``insists'' on being politically rehabilitated
by his party ``not so much for myself but for the people who
believed'' in his reforms.
   In interviews earlier this year in Czechoslovakia in which he
broke years of silence, Dubcek praised Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for working to reform the Soviet economy and liberalize
politics to some degree.
   Several Italian newspapers on Sunday quoted Dubcek as commenting
at an encounter with university officials on Saturday that Gorbachev
``is our hope, that great man.''
   In the televised discussion, Dubcek said that Gorbachev's reform
campaign could help ``nations and people to come closer together.''
   He added that if Gorbachev's policies fail, ``the return will be
much worse than you can imagine ... a neo-Stalinism that you could
not imagine.''
   One Italian newspaper, Il Resto del Carlino, quoted Dubcek as
saying during the visit: ``I want to return to my country. I think I
will be more useful there than outside.''
   Before leaving Czechoslovakia on Friday, Dubcek said he feared
that Communist authorities might not let him return home.
   His wife, Anna, was also granted an exit travel visa but
announced at the last minute that she was staying behind because of
illness.
   Posters reading ``Welcome, Comrade Dubcek'' decorated many of the
streets in Bologna, a Communist stronghold in Italy's north-central
``Red Belt.''

<HEAD>Mike Mansfield, Ambassador to Japan, Retiring at 85</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS six grafs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield, one of Japan's best
foreign friends, announced Monday he is retiring at age 85.
   Mansfield, whose service to the United States started at 14 when
he was an under-age enlistee in the Navy, told a packed news
conference at the American Embassy that he and his wife Maureen had
waited until after the U.S. presidential election to make their
decision.
   ``We decided it was time for me to resign at the will of the
president, and that has been done,'' he said.
   Mansfield, a Montana Democrat, set longevity records in his 16
years as U.S. Senate majority leader and in his 11 years as envoy in
the crucial Tokyo post under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan.
   In January, he had coronary bypass surgery, causing a renewal of
speculation that he might retire, but he returned to the Tokyo
Embassy last spring.
   He said he would leave Tokyo before the first of the year.
   Mansfield said he had waited for the resolution of the issue of
U.S. rice imports to Japan, as well as the presidential election,
before making his decision.
   Washington has decided not to make an immediate attempt to force
the opening of the Japanese rice market, a position endorsed by
Mansfield, who has long touted the U.S.-Japan relationship as the
most important to Washington _ ``bar none,'' he always says.
   The situation is stable now between the two countries, he said,
and he and his wife ``can leave with our heads held high and our
arms swinging.''
   But he said he was leaving with regret after ``an exhilarating
experience.''
   To the Japanese, the appointment of Mansfield in 1977 was a happy
one because of his immense prestige in the U.S. Congress and his
long advocacy of Japan and East Asia as of great importance to the
United States.
   There were rumors later, however, of splits in both the U.S.
State Department and the Tokyo Embassy into pro- and anti-Mansfield
camps, with the latter arguing he was too ``soft'' on Japan and had
failed to counsel firm stances on the trade issues that caused
friction in the Washington-Tokyo relationship.
   But Mansfield argued in his defense that Japanese markets had
opened in many ways during his tenure and Japan has taken on a
significant portion of the security burden in Asia.
   He was in favor of negotiating a wide-ranging trade agreement
with Japan, an idea that now is being studied but is not likely to
materialize for years.
   ``What we ought to do is sit down, get away from this nickel and
diming way of conducting trade negotiations ... and face up to the
issue as a whole. Not the $60-billion deficit with Japan, but the
$170-billion deficit with the whole world,'' he told correspondents
last year.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Share Prices Up Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell today against the Japanese yen,
while share prices edged up on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 123.00 yen, its lowest point since Jan. 4
when it finished at 121.65 yen, off 0.70 yen from Friday's close of
123.70 yen. The currency opened at 122.55 yen, also the lowest since
Jan. 4, and ranged from 122.50 to 123.10 yen.
   After dropping sharply, the U.S. currency recovered slightly
toward the end of trading because of dollar-buying by the Bank of
Japan and by speculators, said Yukuo Takahashi, vice president of
Chemical Bank.
   He said the dollar's fall was due mainly to investors' pessimism
about the United States' ability to reduce its trade deficit.
   ``The next president has been elected, but many (investors) doubt
if he has a potential remedy to reduce the deficit,'' Takahashi said.
   But he added the dollar was not likely to decline much further
ahead of the release of U.S. trade figures for September, which is
due Wednesday.
   Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa Bank attributed the dollar's decline
to speculative dollar-selling.
   ``Market players are likely to buy the dollar only when the Bank
of Japan intervenes, but their dollar-selling trend is so strong
otherwise,'' he said.
   The central bank was reported to have bought dollars shortly
after the market opened. The bank does not publicly comment on its
activities, but Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita said it was
willing to take concerted measures with other nations to prevent the
U.S. currency from falling further.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa also said the foreign exchange
rate needs to be watched closely, and there would be aggressive
intervention if the rate becomes un stable.
   Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which reached a
record high 28,489.57 points Friday, added another 31.33 points, or
0.11 percent, to close at 28,520.90. The index lost 83.01 points in
early trading but gradually recovered.
   ``This proves the Tokyo market is stable,'' said a trader with a
major securities firm, speaking anonymously. He said trading was
thin due to uncertainty in the foreign exchange market.
   A Nomura Securities' analyst also said many market players were
in a wait-and-see mood ahead of the release of the September trade
figures.
   Financial issues attracted participants in thin trading with
first section volume estimated at 550 million shares.

   Suspected Tamil separatists today
ambushed a private passenger bus in northeastern Sri Lanka, killing
at least 20 men, women and children, police and military sources
said. Three were reported wounded.
   A military spokesman said the massacre occurred at 8 a.m. near
Pinkatiya, 146 miles northeast of Colombo. The victims were all
believed to be Sinhalese, police said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   According to police in Colombo, a group of suspected Tamil
extremists surrounded the bus as it was traveling from Trincomalee
to Anuradhapura, a Sinhalese holy city. It was not known how many
passengers were aboard the bus.
   It was the first attack by Tamil rebels since the Oct. 9 massacre
of 47 people in a Sinhalese village in the war-torn region.
   The attack occurred as officials were preparing for Saturday's
election of a provincial council to take over administrative duties
in the newly merged northeastern district.
   The council is a key provision of an India-sponsored peace accord
aimed at granting limited autonomy in the district. The move is
aimed at ending five years of bloodshed by Tamil extremists
demanding a separate homeland.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They claim they are denied education, jobs and
land by the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75
percent of the population and control the govearnment and the army.
   The liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam, the most militant of the
Tamil separatist groups, opposes the peace accord saying that it
does not go far enough in meeting demands for self-rule.
   The Tigers have threatened to disrupt Saturday's election.

<HEAD>`I Do's' Echo As Eight Couples Marry After Housing Project Sweep</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Theoauther in 7th graf is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the only alternative, make that
altar-native, for 16 residents at a public housing project after
police told the eight live-in boyfriends to get married or get
moving.
   So on Sunday, eight brides, dressed in pink gowns donated by a
local dressmaker, and eight grooms, wearing black tuxedos provided
by a formal wear store, tied the knot.
   After a Sept. 20 police raid to combat gang violence in the
Rockwell Gardens housing project, overnight guests were banned,
meaning the boyfriends were forced to choose between walking down
the aisle or walking out the door.
   The blunt dictum became a big impetus for some couples.
   ``I just love it,'' said the former Tammy Grigsby, 20, who
married Eugene Young, 54. ``We had been planning to get married, but
since they went on and pressed the issue, we was all for it.''
   The couples beamed as the Rev. Louise Reed pronounced them
husbands and wives at a makeshift altar at the nearby Malcolm X
College auditorium.
   ``I love it,'' said Theoauther Bower, 36, who married Linda
Jackson, 31. ``It came out real beautiful _ mighty fine.''
   Robert Johnson, 26, and Linda Hardy, 28, are the parents of seven
children, but their wedding day was no less a cause for celebration.
   ``When they raided my house, that was wrong,'' said Johnson.
``But today is the best day of my life. ... I'm ready to party.''
   Chicago Housing Authority Chairman Vincent Lane, whose agency
arranged the wedding, said the nuptials represent a step in the
right direction for the residents involved.
   The agency also will work with the husbands, all unemployed, to
help them find jobs, he said.
   ``These people are models and I have high hope for them,'' said
Lane, who attended the brief ceremony. ``I think a great deal of
what happens in public housing in Chicago is riding on their
shoulders.
   ``People will say the only reason they're getting married is
because of (the raids),'' he said. ``I don't think that's true.''
   But if nothing else, the marriages mean a number of the men won't
have to violate a police order to visit their children.
   ``I was really upset because (Cedric) couldn't come see the kids
and I couldn't see him for a couple weeks,'' said Marie Woods, 24,
about her new husband, Cedric Smith.
   ``We were taking our time,'' she said. ``But all this came up
with the gangs, so we decided we was going to get married.''
   Smith, 25, said the gang situation has improved since the raids.
   ``I was glad they did it,'' he said. ``The situation that was
over there with the gangs _ you was running for your life.''
   And if the newlyweds were pleased, their parents were ecstatic.
   ``I think it's great,'' said Jesse Hardy, father of the new Mrs.
Johnson. ``I tried to get her to marry a long time ago.''

   President-elect George Bush and Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle may be more than just running mates. A
genealogist who specializes in the lineage of presidents says Bush
and Quayle are 10th cousins once removed.
   The two are also related to Abraham Lincoln, and the man thought
to be Marilyn Monroe's father, said Gary Boyd Roberts, a genealogist
at the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston.
   Bush, a Yankee, and Quayle, from a wealthy Indiana newspaper
publishing family, both have 17th century roots in New England,
Roberts said.
   Roberts has spent almost a decade researching Bush's ancestry,
which will be included in his upcoming book on presidential lineage,
timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of George Washington's
inauguration April 30.
   Roberts is director of publications at the genealogical society,
the nation's oldest and second largest.
   ``Part of my mission is to show how one goes out from one's self
to one's family to the community and to various groups around the
nation,'' Roberts said. ``If you look at pedigree, you can tell
about patterns in culture.''
   Bush, he said, is only the third of what he calls ``Social
Register'' presidents. The first two, Republican Theodore Roosevelt
and Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who were distant cousins,
were closely connected to New York society.
   Both Bush and Quayle are WASPs _ white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants
_ with a twist. They both have strong ancestral ties to the South as
well as New England, Roberts said.
   According to Roberts, Bush is distantly related to 10 American
presidents, including Franklin Pierce, the nearest relation (fifth
cousins four times removed); Lincoln; Ulysses S. Grant; Rutherford
B. Hayes; Grover Cleveland; William Howard Taft; Calvin Coolidge;
Franklin Roosevelt; Richard Nixon; and Gerald Ford, the most distant
relation (11th cousins once removed.)
   Bush also is descended from British royalty going as far back as
12th century King Henry I, the son of William the Conqueror, said
Roberts.
   Quayle ``almost certainly'' has some royal ancestry but Roberts
has not thoroughly researched his family tree. And he had ancestors
on the Mayflower, including Miles Standish and John Alden. Quayle's
father is a member of the Mayflower Society.
   But that honor, as Roberts explains it, is not uncommon. There
are an estimated 20 million to 30 million people descended from the
23 families who survived passage on the Mayflower, Roberts said.
   Bush's and Quayle's common ancestor was James Hamlin, who died in
Barnstable in 1690. Bush and Nixon, as well as former presidents
Hayes and Taft, are descended from Robert Foote, of Shalford, in the
English county of Essex, who died in 1608.
   Bush and Franklin Delano Roosevelt share an ancestor in Anne
Marbury, the noted religious reformer, heretic and a founder of
Rhode Island, who was killed by Indians on Long Island in 1643.
   Roberts discovered one of both Bush's and Quayle's more
celebrated relatives _ Marilyn Monroe _ through another genealogist
affiliated with the society, Richard Brenneman. Brenneman has
documentation to show that Bush and Quayle share a common ancestor
with Monroe's supposed father, Charles Stanley Gifford, who was born
in Rhode Island in 1888 and died in California in 1965.
   Most Monroe biographies cite Gifford as the man Monroe's mother
claimed was her father. Monroe's mother never married Gifford but
Monroe and Gifford made contact with each other over the years.

<DATELINE>NABLUS, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Graffiti spray-painted along a
hilly street in this West Bank city gave a message of intransigence
to the Palestinian leaders meeting in Algeria.
   ``It is disgraceful for a hand to shake hands with the one who
kills our own people,'' said the slogan, signed by a pro-Syrian PLO
faction.
   While many in the occupied territories are looking to the
Palestine National Council session in Algiers to declare Palestinian
independence on Tuesday, thus granting implicit recognition of
Israel's existence, a significant number strongly reject such a move.
   The slogan in Nablus was signed by the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Syrian-backed PLO faction long opposed to
softening the Palestinian refusal to recognize the reality of Israel
40 years after its founding.
   Already, other small Syrian-backed, leftist PLO factions such as
Saiqa, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, and Fatah Uprising have declared a boycott of this week's
session of the Palestine council.
   Moslem fundamentalists, who command an even larger following than
the leftists, also object to any move toward recognizing Israel. In
a leaflet distributed in the occupied lands last week, the
fundamentalist group Hamas, or Zeal, called on the PLO not to
capitulate.
   ``We are against all the positions that are calling for the end
of armed struggle ... for peace with the murderers ... for
recognition of a Zionist state on even one inch of our land,'' it
said.
   Fundamentalists have repeatedly disputed the PLO-backed
leadership of the 11-month uprising against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The PLO, which includes the Palestinians' 20 percent Christian
minority as well as majority Moslems, wants Palestine to be a
secular nation, while fundamentalists demand an Islamic state.
   The differences were recently patched up, but the rift apparently
is reopening over the issue of recognizing Israel.
   The declaration of independence expected to be accepted by the
Palestine council is based on the United Nations' 1947 partition
plan calling for Arab and Jewish states side-by-side in Palestine,
or what has become Israel and the occupied territories.
   Moderate Palestinians argue this implies recognition of the
Jewish state and hope a council declaration based on the so-called
two-state solution would open the way for peace talks.
   But Moslem fundamentalists argue the PLO-dominated Palestine
National Council has no right to speak for all Palestinians.
   ``The PNC (Palestine council) does not take Islamic stands,''
said Ahmed, a lecturer at An-Najah University in Nablus who refused
to give his last name. ``I don't think the Islamic movement is
represented in the PNC.''
   Sheik Said Bilal, a fundamentalist leader in Nablus, said that
before adopting a declaration of independence, the Palestine council
should consult Islamic religious leaders throughout the world.
   He named a half-dozen such leaders in countries from Egypt to
Pakistan, which is not an Arab country.
   ``Palestine is an Islamic land and the entire Islamic nation
should decide whether the partition plan would be a good step,'' he
said.
   Other non-fundamentalist Palestinians see the disunity over the
issue as reason enough to hold off on any new stance toward Israel.
   Bassam Shakaa, the hardline ex-mayor of Nablus who lost his legs
in a car bomb set by Jewish underground members, said any
declaration of independence should have the backing not only of
Palestinians but of most Arab nations.
   ``Unless we first establish unity,'' he said, ``we will not get
more support for our struggle through this declaration.''

   A strong earthquake was recorded today in the
Bismarck archipelago northeast of Papua New Guinea, the Hong Kong
observatory reported.
   The observatory said the quake struck at 10:24 a.m. (9:24 p.m.
Sunday EST) and registered a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the
open-ended Richter scale.
   The earthquake's epicenter was about 530 miles north northeast of
Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea, the observatory said. It had no
further details about the quake.
   The Richter scale measures the total strength of an earthquake as
recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number represents a
tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake measuring six on the
scale is capable of causing extensive damage in populated areas.

<HEAD>Despite `Get-Tough' Police Sweeps, Drug-Dealing Gangs Still Roam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug-dealing gang members are killing in
record numbers this year with no end to the deadly violence in
sight, despite police claims that they are not losing a street war
waged against the gangs.
   The battle is being won in target areas such as south-central Los
Angeles, police said, but those successes are not reflected in the
numbers.
   ``We aren't losing the war, we just aren't winning in the data,''
department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said Friday. But he
conceded, ``The data does tell us we are a long way from winning the
war.''
   Police Department figures show gang-related homicides rose
threefold in October compared with the same month last year, from 11
to 33. For the year through Oct. 31, they were up nearly 25 percent,
from 166 in 1987 to 207.
   That total already surpasses the record 205 gang killings for all
of 1987.
   And during the weekend, four more people were slain in gang-style
attacks.
   In Los Angeles County areas where the sheriff enforces the law,
79 gang-related murders were recorded by late October, matching the
total for all of 1987.
   Meanwhile, the crack-dealing gangs called the Crips and Bloods,
the deadliest gangs in the nation's second-largest city, continue to
surface in towns and cities across the western United States.
   In April, Mayor Tom Bradley, a former police lieutenant, vowed
during the first 1,000-officer gang task force sweep, ``We are going
to take these terrorists off the streets of Los Angeles.''
   More than 21,000 people, 12,000 of them gang members, have been
arrested by the department's gang task force since February, most of
them during the highly publicized sweeps, including one Saturday
night that netted more than 175 people. Police said they do not know
at this point how many arrests resulted in convictions.
   In late October, gang violence took an especially heavy toll. A
football star at California State University, Long Beach, had a
kidney removed after using his body to shield a child from a bullet
at a Halloween party, and 10 people were wounded outside a birthday
party the same weekend, including a 15-month-old child who later
died.
   Booth said that despite the rising gang murder rate, it's too
early to call those sweeps ineffective.
   ``You can't jump to conclusions that nothing is working,'' Booth
said. ``I think we're making some impact overall, and we're going to
make more impact.''
   In south-central Los Angeles, where the gangs are worst and task
force sweeps most frequent, homicide is down 17 percent, robbery
down 4 percent and rape down 5 percent in October compared with a
year ago, the police figures show.
   Gangs, however, are simply moving into other areas of the city to
ply their drug trade, Booth conceded.
   On the city's west side, for instance, there have been 20 murders
through October compared with 17 for the same period last year. In
the San Fernando Valley, there have been 26 deaths compared with
eight through October 1987.

<HEAD>Former Prime Minister Takeo Miki Dead At 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Takeo Miki, who was in the
peace camp when it was unpopular in the 1930s and worked to keep
monied interests from exerting undue influence in politics, died
today of acute heart failure. He was 81.
   Miki, hospitalized since June 1986 when he suffered a cerebral
hemorrhage, died this morning at Mitsui Memorial Hospital, his aides
said.
   ``Mr. Miki was a politician who consistently carried out his work
with integrity before, during and after World War II,'' Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita said in a television interview. ``His
creed toward political ethics was a strong leadership ideal.''
   Miki served in the House of Representatives for a record 51
consecutive years beginning in 1937, and was prime minister from
1974 to 1976.
   Eishiro Saito, chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said in a statement that Miki was a
``walking dictionary'' of modern Japanese politics.
   ``His death comes at a time when the issue of trust in politics
is being asked now,'' Saito added, referring to a stock scandal now
rocking Japanese politics that involved scores of politicians and
political aides who made huge profits by selling unlisted shares in
a real estate firm before they were offered to the public.
   Miki had a long-standing reputation as a pacifist he earned by
speaking out against the possibility of war with the United States
in 1938, at a time when militarists were ascendant in government and
such sentiments were suppressed.
   Throughout his career, he fought for political reforms, most
prominently when he was the compromise choice for leadership of the
Liberal Democratic Party and the premiership after the 1974 crisis
caused by the resignation of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.
   Tanaka had resigned over burgeoning financial scandals and public
criticism of the party's ``money politics.''
   Miki's selection was largely intended to refurbish the party's
tainted image because he was a stern foe within the party of
Tanaka-style politics and he had the least ties to vested business
interests.
   He did not earn favor with all in the party, and he was once
called ``the man closest to the opposition camp'' by Yasuhiro
Nakasone, a political rival who later became prime minister.
   While premier, Miki faced such major problems as the recession
triggered by the 1973 ``oil shock'' and the so-called Lockheed
scandal.
   In February 1976, a U.S. Senate subcommittee disclosed
multimillion-dollar payments allegedly made by the U.S.-based
Lockheed Corp. to Japanese business and government figures to
promote sales of its aircraft in Japan.
   Miki vigorously pursued the investigation, and Tanaka eventually
was tried and convicted for taking a bribe. Tanaka, who has since
suffered a stroke and has appeals before the courts, has not gone to
prison.
   Miki's campaign split the Liberal Democrats into pro- and
anti-Miki camps, which campaigned separately for the House of
Representatives elections in December 1976. The Liberal Democrats
fell seven seats short of the 256 neeeded for a majority and had to
enlist eight independents for a fragile majority.
   Miki resigned to accept responsibility for the poor showing but
retained his seat until the end.
   A native of the southern island of Shikoku, where he was born
March 17, 1907, Miki studied at the University of California at
Berkeley and at Meiji University in Japan.
   His major government positions included minister of international
trade and industry in 1965-66 and foreign minister in 1966-67.
   Miki is survived by his wife Mutsuko, two sons and one daughter.
Buddhist funeral services will be held Thursday at the Zojoji Temple
in Tokyo.

<HEAD>Once Shunned Avant-Garde Director to Return for `Long Time'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stage director Yuri Lyubimov, stripped of his
citizenship four years ago, will return to Moscow for a lengthy
visit in January to direct two plays at his avant-garde Taganka
Theater, official media said today.
   ``I'll come for a long time since I've received an official
invitation, even though I'll work under a contract,'' Lyubimov was
quoted as saying.
   ``Although I have commitments under contracts in the West, I'm
longing to come home, to the Taganka Theater,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   The government news agency Novosti, quoting the upcoming edition
of the news weekly New Times, said the 70-year-old Lyubimov would
stage the play ``Alive,'' written by Boris Mozhayev in the 1960s,
and a work by Fyodor Dostoyevsky _ probably ``The Possessed.''
   The report did not say how long Lyubimov will remain, or whether
his visit might turn into a permanent stay.
   It quoted Lyubimov as saying in Stockholm, where he is staging
Mikhail Bulgakov's masterpiece ``The Master and Marguerita,'' that
he has found life difficult in the West. He has settled in Israel,
but has directed plays in the United States and throughout western
Europe.
   ``Some people think life here is like heaven. I'll put it bluntly
_ life here is very, very hard. To live a normal life without any
luxuries a producer should make at least four plays a year in good
theaters. This is very difficult. You have to work very hard,''
Lyubimov was quoted as saying.
   Lyubimov returned to Moscow briefly last spring after indications
officials were taking a conciliatory attitude toward him.
   Many plays, art works and publications that were banned in
previous years now are being published under Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness.
   Lyubimov's avant-garde productions in his 20-year career at the
Taganka theater often ran into trouble with Communist Party and
government officials.
   The Novosti report quoted him as saying ``Alive'' was one of the
productions he tried several times to stage in Moscow without
success.
   In 1983, Lyubimov went to London to stage Dostoyevsky's ``Crime
and Punishment'' amid speculation that he would not be allowed to
return.
   He extended his stay in London, demanding assurances that he
would be allowed artistic freedom in the Soviet Union. But in March
1984 he was fired from his job and expelled from the Communist
Party. Four months later, he was stripped of his citizenship.

   Thirty-seven people were slain by a
death squad shortly after soldiers and police officers left this
northern gold mining town, local authorities say. Among the dead
were six children and eight women.
   Thirty-five others were wounded in the submachine-gun and
hand-grenade attack, which occurred Friday night in this town 180
miles north of Bogota, Mayor Rita Ivon told The Associated Press on
Sunday.
   Miss Ivon, of the leftist Patriotic Union Party, said the gunmen
criss-crossed through this town of 16,000 during the massacre.
   The Patriotic Union Party has long claimed government security
forces operate right-wing death squads. Colombia's Human Rights
Commission says death squads have killed 600 members of the party in
the last three years.
   On Saturday, Mayor Carlos Rojo of nearby Remedios said the attack
on Segovia was carried out by a right-wing death squad that has been
active in the area. Rojo is also a member of the Patriotic Union
Party.
   Army Gen. Raul Rojas Cubillos on Saturday blamed the Segovia
massacre on leftist guerrillas who have been fighting for 25 years
to overthrow Colombia's government and establish a Marxist state.
   During a funeral service Sunday for the victims, pallbearers
dropped one coffin in the town square and it caused a noise that
sounded like a gunshot. Believing the killers were returning, many
mourners fled and several were injured in the panic.
   At an army base a half-mile from Segovia where 600 troops are
based, guards told the AP no officers were available to be
interviewed about the massacre. Guards at the town police station,
where 20 officers normally are stationed, gave the same response.
   Until Friday, troops had been patrolling Segovia around the
clock, Miss Ivon said. She said the soldiers had been there since a
nationwide one-day strike Oct. 24.
   All troops and policemen vanished from the town's streets when
the gunmen arrived at 7 p.m., she said.
   Miss Ivon said the attackers began tossing grenades and firing
bursts of submachine-gun fire into windows and doors of houses. A
hand grenade lobbed into a bar killed eight patrons, she said.
   The gunmen also fired into a Roman Catholic church on the town
square where dozens of people were attending a Mass but no one was
hit, the mayor said.
   Friday's attack was the second most deadly in recent years in
Colombia. On Aug. 23, 12 civilians, 12 police and 18 guerrillas were
slain during a rebel raid on Saiza, 280 miles north of Bogota.

   The battle for control of the country's
largest Teamsters local and its 8,500 members pits the powerful and
corrupt former regime against its old enemies.
   Members of Local 560 will be voting in the first election since a
judge ruled the local was dominated by the mob and then deposed its
executive board in favor of a trustee.
   Michael Sciarra was removed as the local's president, and Joseph
Sheridan as vice president, in 1986 because of their alleged ties to
organized crime. Both deny any wrongdoing, but have been barred from
running for union office.
   It was the first time a union's leadership had been ousted by the
government for corruption.
   While some felt that helped pry the corruption-plagued local from
the grip of organized crime, others perceive one slate of candidates
as trying to wedge that influence back in.
   Danny Sciarra, Michael's brother, and Mark Sheridan, Joseph's
nephew, are on the Teamsters for Liberty ticket, running for
president and vice president, respectively.
   ``I think he killed himself at that nominating meeting,'' former
Teamster George D. Hansen said of Michael Sciarra, who nominated his
brother.
   ``Any talk that they weren't corrupt went down the drain when
(Danny) Sciarra and (Mark) Sheridan were nominated. That's exactly
what happens under mob rule. They're just trying to perpetuate it.''
   If Daniel Sciarra wins the race for president, it's because mob
influence still reigns, said Libero Marotta, a lawyer who advises
opposing candidate Ray Carney. A third slate is not running a
president.
   Carney was a friend of a rival union leader who was slain 27
years ago during a power struggle with former local president
Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano, who is in prison for racketeering
and murder convictions.
   Carney could not be reached for comment. Several messages left at
his campaign headquarters were not returned.
   ``With the (local) you have a history of outright bossism and
gangsterism. It's not a secret that Michael Sciarra was a part of
that. Who's naive enough to believe Danny Sciarra won't be?''
Marotta said.
   Ballots were to be mailed today to members and must be returned
by Dec. 6.
   Danny Sciarra admits he's running in place of his brother and
plans to let Michael in on some of the decision-making at the local.
But he adamantly denies either of them are involved with the mob,
and says Michael looked out only for the interests of the membership.
   Michael Sciarra said there was no intimidation when he was
president, and there will be none if his brother wins. He scoffed at
suggestions the membership wouldn't vote for Danny because of the
allegations against him.
   ``I think they'll vote for him all the more because of what's
happened to me,'' Michael Sciarra said.
   Ed Stier, the trustee who has worked to rid the local of
corruption, said he would not object if Danny Sciarra wins the
election, .
   ``My job isn't to try to call this election,'' Stier said. ``My
job is to create a democratic process in Local 560 by which the
membership has a chance to elect who they want.
   ``You can't overcome 25 or 30 years of dictatorship in a couple
years, but I think we've started that process.''

   Omero Berti's imitation of a boar's grunt
was so good he got shot for it, police say.
   The 70-year-old Berti was wounded in the leg by a gunshot fired
by his brother, Ovidio, 62, when he hid behind a bush and gave a
wild boar's grunt as a joke while the two were hunting Sunday,
police in this central Italian town said.
   Omero Berti was reported in good condition in a local hospital.

   Donna Folse went to a lot of trouble to blow
a big pink bubble. And by the time the contest judge counted to 15,
she was wearing a smile and a blue ribbon.
   ``They tease me at work all the time because I chew gum,'' said
Ms. Folse, the only adult competing in a bubble gum-blowing contest.
``Now I've got a ribbon to show for it.''
   Meantime, her young rivals were peeling bubble gum from their
faces.
   Folse wasn't the only grownup acting like a kid Sunday as 3,000
people celebrated the 100th birthday of this Louisiana city.
Sunday's picnic was the last event in a yearlong centennial
celebration.
   Contests and games included hula-hoop twirling, red-bean
spitting, horseshoe pitching, cricket racing, and a tug of war
between the city administration and City Council.
   Even though the administration pulled to victory, one councilman
claimed his side won.
   ``We thought it was a rope push,'' said Lynn Barthelemy. ``So we
won.''

   A homeless mutt is giving up a dog's
life by moving into the governor's mansion.
   Gov. James Thompson decided to keep a mixed-breed hound found
tied to the fence outside the the grounds of his Springfield
residence over the weekend, said spokesman Jim Bray.
   ``The governor fell in love with the dog immediately,'' Bray
said. ``He's a dog lover _ he's got two already.''
   Thompson named the dog ``Trooper'' in honor of the state police
guards who found him, Bray said.
   A note found with Trooper, who was very thin but otherwise in
good health, said: ``Please give pup a good home, we can't. We will
miss him dearly, please take care of him.''
   Thompson's other two dogs, an Irish setter named Gov and a cocker
spaniel named Mo, took an immediate liking to the new dog as well,
Bray said.
   Bray said Thompson was unconcerned that the dog might be a
political spy.
   ``It's not a Trojan horse ... I think the dog's too young to have
any political leanings,'' Bray said. ``I'm sure it'll be a fan of
the governor.''

<TEXT>
   Snow piled up today in parts of the West, making travel difficult
in many areas from the California mountains to the northern Rockies
and causing minor accidents, but much of the rest of the nation
enjoyed clear skies.
   By late Sunday evening, up to a foot of snow had fallen in the
Jackson, Wyo., area and numerous auto accidents were reported
because of the weather. The only vehicles going over Teton Pass,
west of Jackson, were four-wheel-drive vehicles with chains. An
additional 8 to 14 inches of snow was expected in the area this
morning.
   In the Sierra Nevada, 8 to 10 inches had fallen at Echo Summit.
Truckee, Calif., reported 6 inches of snow.
   ``We've got blizzard conditions out there,'' said Sonja Liles, a
dispatcher for the California Highway Patrol in Truckee. ``We've had
probably 200 accidents, but no fatals ... and only several minor
injuries.''
   As the storm developed over Nevada, winds gusted up to 64 mph.
   Clear skies were reported this morning from the Middle Atlantic
States across the middle Mississippi Valley, central and southern
Plains and the southern Rockies to the desert Southwest.
   Rain extended across parts of the West Coast and New England, and
dense fog developed across the Gulf Coast, northern Florida, and
southern Appalachians.
   Today's forecast called for a major winter storm from the
northern Rockies and northern Plateau into the Great Basin; rain and
snow from the Dakotas across the central Rockies to central Arizona;
scattered thunderstorms in parts of New Mexico and Arizona; rain in
Oregon and California; and showers in Maine.
   Winds were expected to be gusty at times from the Southern
California mountain region across the central Rockies to the central
Plains.
   Predicted highs: 20s in northern Montana; 30s and 40s from
northern California to the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies,
northern Plains, and upper Mississippi Valley to the northern Great
Lakes; 70s from the desert Southwest across most of New Mexico,
Kansas, Oklahoma, middle Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee Valley
to the southern Atlantic Coast; 80s in most of Texas, the Gulf Coast
region and Florida.
   The rest of the nation should be in the 50s or 60s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 16 degrees at
Williston, N.D., to 75 at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Mississippi Governor Won't Claim Victory in County Government
Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Ray Mabus persuaded state lawmakers in
August to adopt anti-corruption changes in county government, and
now voters in more than half of the state's 82 counties have taken
the reforms even further.
   ``It was a vote on how much Mississippi is willing to change,''
said Mabus, who led a group of young, reform-minded Democrats into
office last November with county government reform as one of the
hallmarks of his campaign.
   Voters in 48 counties agreed last Tuesday that their county's
system for constructing and maintaining roads should be changed.
They approved a ballot issue to streamline the corruption-plagued
road operations.
   The county government reorganization bill passed by lawmakers was
inspired by an FBI corruption investigation that snared dozens of
public officials.
   Mabus, as state auditor, assisted the FBI in the crackdown on
corrupt county purchasing practices that resulted in charges ranging
from mail fraud to extortion against 57 county supervisors in 25
counties.
   Prodded by Mabus, the state legislature in August approved a bill
restructuring the state's century-old system of county government,
but left the the road issue up to voters.
   At the time, 22 of the state's counties had already abandoned the
``beat system'' which gave the five supervisors in each county
control over policy and day-to-day operations in the district that
elected them.
   Mabus claimed the ``beat system'' invited officials to steal.
   Under the new system, the part-time supervisors set the policy
and hire an administrator to oversee consolidated county operations.
The state bill also requires counties to establish central
purchasing, receiving and inventory control systems with separate
clerks for each.
   Many of the supervisors vocally opposed the changes. The
410-member Mississippi Association of Supervisors had placed
estimates for the switch at more than $36 million statewide for
property purchases and personnel.
   Mabus and the Mississippi Economic Council, the statewide chamber
of commerce, however, had predicted a statewide savings of $27
million by eliminating duplicated equipment and services.
   While instigator of the changes, Mabus is reluctant to claim the
voter approval of the road changes as a personal victory.
   ``I don't think it's a referendum on you unless your name is on
the ballot,'' Mabus said, while adding that he was ``very happy with
the outcome.''
   Others disagree.
   ``Overall, it was a victory for political reform in the state and
since the governor really took the lead, it was a victory for him,''
said Steven Shaffer, a political science professor at Mississippi
State University.
   House speaker Tim Ford said he viewed the outcome of the
referendum ``as a victory for the citizens of the state, regardless
of who proposed it.'' He added, however, ``Certainly for those in
favor of the unit system, which included the governor, I think it is
a victory.''
   Every urban county in Mississippi, which is largely rural to
begin with, voted to adopt the unit system, but Mabus shuns any
division of the vote along urban-rural lines. Some of the counties
that voted in favor of the switch are ``as rural as you get,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in European trading this morning
after the Bank of Japan reportedly intervened to prop it up in
earlier trading in Tokyo, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices
rose slightly.
   Traders said that while the Bank of Japan bought only a small
amount of dollars at 122.50 yen, they were impressed with the
central bank's persistence in supporting the currency.
   The bank does not publicly comment on its activities, but its
governor, Satoshi Sumita, said it was willing to take concerted
measures with other nations to prevent the U.S. currency from
falling further.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa also was quoted as saying that
``agressive intervention'' will be used if exchange markets are
unstable.
   In the United States, aids to President-elect George Bush said
over the weekend that Bush has no interest in seeing a lower dollar.
As well, Nicholas Brady, who is expected to continue as treasury
secretary under Bush, said the United States remains committed to
exchange rate stability.
   The dollar rallied slightly near the end of Tokyo's trading day,
but closed at 123.00 yen, its lowest level since Jan. 4. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 123.70 yen.
   European traders said one factor adding caution to the market is
Wednesday's scheduled release of U.S. trade figures for September.
   August's trade gap was $12.18 billion and the market expects
September's to range from $9 billion to $11 billion.
   Dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.7465 West German marks, up from 1.7345
   _1.4660 Swiss francs, up from 1.4553
   _5.9680 French francs, up from 5.9285
   _1.9635 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9551
   _1,303.50 Italian lire, up from 1,296.50
   _1.2285 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8030, cheaper for buyers
than late Friday's $1.8137.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for
gold of $420.65 a troy ounce at midmorning, up from $419.95 bid late
Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $420.25, up from $420.20 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 32 cents to close at a bid
$422.51.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.40 a troy ounce,
down from Friday's $6.45.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield Announces Retirement At Age 85</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield, a lean Montanan who
spent much of his lengthy political career promoting better
relations between the United States and Asia, announced today that
he is retiring at age 85.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno reacted to the imminent departure of
Japan's much valued friend with ``deep regret,'' a ministry official
said. Mansfield said he would leave Tokyo before Jan. 1.
   Mansfield, a Democrat who set longevity records during his 16
years as U.S. Senate majority leader and in his 11 years as envoy to
the crucial Tokyo post, told a packed news conference at the
American Embassy that he and his wife Maureen had decided it was
time to retire.
   ``We decided it was time for me to resign subject to the will of
the president, and that has been done,'' Mansfield said.
   Mansfield said he delayed announcing his retirement plans until
after Congress had adjourned; until a resolution had been reached on
U.S. demands that Japan import American rice; and, most importantly,
until after last week's presidential election.
   Describing bilateral relations as ``excellent,'' Mansfield said
the situation between Japan and the United States was stable enough
that ``we can leave with our heads high and our arms swinging.''
   Mansfield's service to the United States started at 14 as an
under-age enlistee in the Navy for the duration of World War I. He
subsequently served with the Army, and later with the Marine Corps,
for whom he worked in Asia.
   Before Mansfield began the first of his five terms as a
representative from Montana's First District in 1942, he taught Far
Eastern and Latin American history at Montana State University.
   In 1944, Mansfield was sent on a foreign policy mission to China
at President Franklin D. Roosevelt's request. Prior to his Tokyo
appointment, he returned to China several times at the invitation of
the Beijing government.
   Mansfield's assignment to Tokyo in 1977 made many Japanese happy
because of his prestige in Congress and his long advocacy of East
Asia's great importance to the United States. The U.S.-Japan
relationship, he often said, is the most important to Washington _
``bar none.''
   It is ``our hope that we will work together in the next century,
which will be the century of the Pacific,'' Mansfield said today.
   Following Mansfield's announcement, Uno expressed appreciation
for the ambassador's efforts to improve relations between Tokyo and
Washington. ``It was truly fortunate that we had a person like
Ambassador Mansfield in Tokyo for a long time,'' ministry officials
quoted him as saying.
   Mansfield's calls for patience in dealing with the Japanese in
trade negotiations generated rumors, however, of splits in both the
State Department and the Tokyo Embassy into pro- and anti-Mansfield
camps. The latter argued he was too ``soft'' on Japan and had failed
to counsel firm stances on the trade issues that caused friction
between Washington and Tokyo.
   Mansfield argued in return that Japanese markets had opened in
many ways during his tenure and Japan has taken on a significant
portion of the security burden in Asia. He spoke out in favor of a
wide-ranging trade agreement with Japan, an idea that is unlikely to
materialize for years.
   ``What we ought to do is sit down, get away from this nickel and
diming way of conducting trade negotiations ... and face up to the
issue as a whole. Not the $60 billion deficit with Japan, but the
$170 billion deficit with the whole world,'' he said last year.
   In January, Mansfield had coronary bypass surgery, renewing
speculation he might retire, but he returned to the Tokyo Embassy
last spring.
   Washington's decision not to make an immediate attempt to force
the opening of the Japanese rice market, a position endorsed by
Mansfield, freed him to retire, convinced of ``the excellent
relationship that exists between our two countries at this time,''
he said today.
   He added he would leave Japan with regret after ``an exhilerating
experience.'' The years in Tokyo ``have been the most enjoyable in
our lives.''

<TEXT>
   Ammonia gas seeped from a cold-storage building
during a blaze that sent three fightfighters to the hospital and
resulted in the evacuation of about 100 people from their homes,
officials said today.
   The multi-alarm fire was burning out of control early today at
the Rainier Cold Storage and Ice building, said Deputy Fire Chief
Steve Bailey. He said the building's walls are packed with sawdust
and the sawdust was smoldering.
   ``This is a fire we dreaded occurring and it occurred,'' Bailey
said. ``We could be here for days.''
   The back wall of the four-story, turn-of-the century building,
originally built by the Rainier Brewing Co., collapsed as flames
shot out its windows.
   The cause of the fire, which broke out Sunday night, had not been
determined, Bailey said.
   About 4,000 pounds of ammonia were in the lines that supply the
building's refrigeration, said Mike Roberts, Rainier vice president
of marketing and warehousing. The bottom floor was an ice plant, he
said.
   Roberts said 22-room structure contained about 13 million pounds
of fruits, vegetables, meats and seafood.
   The odor of ammonia was evident in the area near the blaze.
   ``Normally, it dissipates easily. We had a cloud on the ground
and at one time we had a cloud moving up, so it's hard to tell which
way it's going to go,'' he said.
   Ammonia in high enough concentrations can cause burns on the
throat and lungs and can be fatal.
   Three firefighters were taken to Harborview Medical Center. One
firefighter who inhaled ammonia was admitted in satisfactory
condition, said nursing supervisor Pamela Fanton. A firefighter with
a leg injury and another who suffered chest pains were released.
   About 10 blocks in the mostly industrial area were cordoned off,
said police Sgt. Gary Morrell. About 100 people were taken to an
emergency shelter at a nearby high school, said Hope Tuttle, Red
Cross director of public affair.

   A group of black teen-agers shouting racial slurs
beat two white brothers a block from their home in a melee that left
one black wounded by gunfire, police said.
   Police on Sunday charged two black teen-agers in the brawl on
Staten Island, one of them accused of firing the shot that wounded
another black. Another youth was being sought.
   The attack was believed to be the second racial incident in the
borough in a little more than a month, police said. On Oct. 7, a
17-year-old black was struck and killed by a car after an encounter
with a group of whites.
   Daniel Marsac, 20, and Dean Marsac, 17, told police they were
attacked as they walked home early Sunday. One suffered a broken
nose and the other a black eye, said their father, Daniel G. Marsac.
   ``About 20 to 30 kids, all black, are slamming their fists into
their hands, saying `White boy, white boy,''' the younger Daniel
Marsac said.
   ``They grabbed me from behind by my jacket, about five of them,
and three of them jumped on my brother,'' he said. ``I was afraid of
knives _ but then I heard gunshots.''
   Police said at least three shots were fired, one of which hit
Lloyd Bryson, 17, in the side. He was listed in satisfactory
condition at St. Vincent's Medical Center.
   Nobert Jamel Grigger, 14, was charged as an adult with assault

Boone, 16, was charged with assault and aggravated harassment of the
Marsac brothers, O'Donnell said.

<HEAD>Surgeon General Talks About Minorities And AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discrimination, language problems and poverty are
as much at the heart of the AIDS epidemic as drug abuse and
promiscuity, says U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.
   ``If you just look at the numbers in AIDS, the numbers that have
died, you're missing the whole story,'' Koop said Sunday at a news
conference before an address at a meeting of the Association of
American Medical Colleges.
   ``Minorities, poverty, discrimination, access to care ... all
these are part of the whole story.''
   He said the fight against the deadly disease has failed to convey
AIDS information effectively to blacks and Hispanics, who have been
stricken with AIDS in numbers disproportionate to their populations.
   Of the 77,994 AIDS cases reported since June 1981 in the United
States, 26 percent were among blacks and 15 percent among Hispanics.
Blacks make up about 14 percent of the overall population and
Hispanics make up 7 percent.
   Koop said higher rates of illiteracy in the black and Hispanic
communities may be part of the problem in conveying information
about the disease.
   A related problem is lack of access to health care among
minorities and groups at high risk for contracting AIDS, such as
prostitutes and intravenous drug users, he said.
   ``We have to make sure that they get it,'' Koop said. But often,
``they don't know where to get it ... and many times, the medical
profession doesn't feel comfortable treating them.''
   Koop said the government AIDS education campaign has employed
black and Hispanic public relations firms to reach those groups,
``so it's very difficult to understand where these black and
Hispanic groups are making their errors.''

<HEAD>A Revival of Shaw's `The Devil's Disciple' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS four grafs with reviews from other critics. No PMs
planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Devil's Disciple'' is the most melodramatic
of George Bernard Shaw's comedies, a play in which the hero spends a
good deal of the last act with a noose around his neck, waiting to
be hanged.
   It requires a swashbuckler of an actor, a daring doer who can
physically dominate the stage, charm the other characters, as well
as the audience, and at the same time, negotiate some of Shaw's
wittiest and trickiest dialogue.
   Fortunately, Circle in the Square has found such an adep|
performer for its revival of the play which opened Sunday on
Broadway. His name is Victor Garber, and he pretty much lifts this
production out of the ordinary all by himself.
   Television audiences may know Garber as Liberace II. He was the
king of piano glitz in the second of two recent TV movies based on
the entertainer's life.
   New York theateregoers have had a better chance to appraise his
talent in such diverse offerings as ``Deathtrap,'' ``Sweeney Todd,''
``Little Me'' and ``Wenceslas Square.'' In most of them, the actor
played supporting roles.
   Now Garber comes into his own as the star of this production. He
portrays Dick Dudgeon, a self-professed follower of the devil who
ends up a man of God by the time the curtain falls.
   The setting is Revolutionary War New Hampshire, and the
playwright is concerned with the hypocrisy of war and peace. Dick's
opposite number is the Rev. Anthony Anderson, a Yankee minister who
also undergoes a conversion of sorts. He trades his pulpit for
pistols before the story is over.
   The transformation occurs after the ne'er-do-well is mistaken for
the minister and is sentenced by the British to hang. Dick readily
goes along with the mistake, willing to die for another man. His
ultimate act of sacrifice is disrupted by the reverend's wife,
Judith, who, at least in this production, becomes smitten with the
imposter.
   Their romantic attachment is more than hinted at in director
Stephen Porter's swiftly paced production. Roxanne Hart overdoes the
emotion as the minister's loyal but bewildered wife. She swoons a
bit too much at the dashing Dudgeon.
   But then one can sense her disinterest in her minister husband
played with diffidence by Remak Ramsay. His conversion from boring
pastor to mighty warrior is unconvincing and seems unexpected.
   Garber's only real support in what is a large cast comes from
Philip Bosco, a veteran Circle in the Square performer. Bosco plays
the British Gen. Burgoyne. It's a small but pivotal role, and the
actor has the wit, urbanity and stage presence to carry it off. The
general is Shaw's voice of common sense, a realist who sees what
will happen to the American colonies and what Dudgeon is trying to
accomplish by his masquerade.
   The physical production is respectable if unexciting. Zack
Brown's turntable settings slammed up against one wall are spartan.
A flooring of wooden planks cover the elongated playing area with
the audience on three sides.
   Respectable is a good word for the entire production. Porter's
professional direction never slips, even when his two most
interesting actors are off stage. Still, the play becomes even more
than that when Bosco and particularly Garber are on stage. It's
these two performers who put this revival of ``The Devil's
Disciple'' on the side of the angels.
   Other critics, such as Newsday's Leo Seligsohn, lamented ``the
unevenness of the evening. For all the stylishness of the production
at its best, (Porter) hasn't wrung the same high-quality acting from
everyone.''
   Howard Kissel of the Daily News applauded the work of Garber and
Hart but complained that the production ``starts shakily'' and
features ``heavy-handed'' acting by other principals.
   Frank Rich of The New York Times said ``the work of both stars is
exemplary, just as Mr. Porter's staging is largely above reproach.
But this time the gathering of our most lustrous Shavian ensemble
seems a frivolous waste of valuable resources.''
   Clive Barnes of the New York Post said the production was
``worthy but a little commonplace, its pleasures proving all as
predictable as a fast-food hamburger with most of the trimmings.''

   President Chaim Herzog asked Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir today to form Israel's next government, and Shamir
pledged to make a ``tremendous effort'' to advance peace with the
Arabs.
   The president called on Israel's two major parties, Shamir's
right-wing Likud and the rival left-leaning Labor, to try to form a
national unity government.
   But it appeared most likely Shamir would form a government with
small right-wing parties and three religious parties.
   Shamir, speaking at the presidential mansion after being summoned
by Herzog, agreed to try to explore a unity government but made it
clear he alone would lead the government and would not share power
with Labor as he did after the 1984 stalemated elections.
   Shamir promised to include in his Cabinet all the parties ``that
would agree to be part of a Likud-led government.''
   However, Labor Party Secretary-General Uzi Bar-Am said Labor
would accept nothing less than an equal partnership with Likud.
   After the 1984 elections, Shamir and Peres agreed to divide
Cabinet posts equally and both served as premier for two years. This
time, however, Likud has the ability to form a government with small
religious and right-wing parties and was unlikely to grant Labor's
demand for equality.
   Herzog referred to the growing tension between secular and
religious Jews in Israel and the Orthodox and non-Orthodox abroad
that emerged after religious parties demanded major concessions as
the price for backing Shamir.
   Based on thousands of telegrams and letters to his office, the
president said, ``There is a wish for unity to confront the dangers
from outside and the separation threatening us from within.''
   Ultra-Orthodox parties have demanded legislation giving them
final say over conversions to Judaism, marriage and divorce.
   This puts them on a collision course with Reform and Conservative
Jews, who constitute a majority in the United States. They warned
such moves would undermine identification with Israel and could
ultimately threaten political and financial support.
   Many secular Israelis, who make up three-quarters of Israel's 3.5
million Jews, have protested religious demands to close pubs,
restaurants and soccer stadiums on the Jewish Sabbath and enforce a
law banning the sale of pork.
   In a radio interview, Shamir appeared to hold out a peace feeler
to Labor. He said government guidelines on negotiations with the
Arabs had not yet been composed and hinted Labor would have a say in
formulating such policy if they agreed to his leadership of th
government.
   But four years of conflict between Shamir and Peres left
bitterness that would be difficult to overcome. Political
concessions would also be difficult for Labor to accept, especially
an expected Likud demand that Labor give up its support for an
international peace conference.
   ``The government I put together will, with the help of God, see
as its first goal to make a tremendous effort to advance the peace
process and achieve friendship and understanding with our
neighbors,'' Shamir said in the radio interview.
   According to Israeli law, Shamir has 21 days to put the
government in place. If necessary, he can request an extension of 21
days.
   Rafi Edri, who headed a Labor delegation that met with Herzog
earlier today, conceded the left-leaning party's defeat.
   ``This morning it's clear that Shamir will form the next
government. We did what we could and we did not succeed, but we did
not compromise our principles,'' he told reporters.
   Even though Shamir seemed assured of being able to muster a
majority in parliament, the battle over posts in the 25-member
Cabinet could at least delay, and possibly sabotage, his efforts to
form a government.
   The agreements with one religious party, Agudat Israel, also
remained to be finalized.
   Likud legislator David Levy angrily denounced the agreement with
Agudat Israel and another religious party, Shas, that yielded
crucial Cabinet portfolios to the ultra-Orthodox in exchange for
their support.
   ``I think a very serious mistake was made here, and I can only be
sorry about it,'' said Levy, adding he thought the party gave away
too much.
   To woo Shas and Agudat Israel into the coalition, Shamir promised
what Labor and its staunchly secular allies would not _ the
amendment to Israel's ``Who is a Jew'', or Law of Return, which
guarantees automatic citizenship to all Jews and converts.
   Other concessions included a promise to Shas party leader Rabbi
Yitzhak Peretz that he would hold the key portfolios of deputy prime
minister and interior minister, the Jerusalem Post said.

<HEAD>Bugler Recalls Missing Note While Playing Taps At Kennedy Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 25 years have passed since bugler
Keith Clark missed the sixth note of taps at the funeral of John F.
Kennedy.
   Clark recovered and completed the song, but the note that broke
off-key stays with him.
   ``I missed a note under pressure,'' he said. ``It's something you
don't like, but it's something that can happen to a trumpet player.''
   ``You never really get over it,'' said Clark, now 60 and retired.
   Clark, as lead trumpeter in the Army Band when Kennedy was
assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, was assigned the task of sounding
taps at the president's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery in
Virginia.
   Clark had played taps daily for four years, giving hundreds of
flawless performances at Arlington and adjacent Fort Myer.
   At Kennedy's funeral, Clark swallowed hard as the 21 guns fired,
then took his cue. On the sixth note, he faltered.
   ``It is like the speaker of the House saying, `Ladies and
gentleman, the president of the United States.' That is not at all
hard to say,'' Clark said. ``But to do it then, and to do it there _
that's when the pressure comes; that's when it becomes difficult all
of a sudden. A lot of people can sing in the shower, you know.''
   In the aftermath, the crackling note assumed a lore of its own.
It was widely believed that the break was intentional, a ripple of
sadness left to the mourners.
   For a month after the funeral, buglers missed that note ``like
crazy'' at Arlington, Clark said. ``We all thought it must be
psychological,'' he said.
   After the service, Clark confronted the commanding officer who
had given him the assignment, angrily thrusting the bugle at him.
   ``Here you take it,'' he said. ``You play it next time.''
   Clark retired from the Army in 1966 and teaches trumpet part-time
at a community college. The bugle is on display at the Smithsonian
Institution.

   The army said today it arrested at least 54
Palestinian guerrillas in the West Bank while the PLO's
parliament-in-exile met in Algiers with the intention of declaring
an independent Palestine homeland.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian activists
distributed copies of an anthem for the would-be state entitled ``My
Homeland, My Homeland.''
   ``Palestine live free, live liberated from the enemy,'' said the
lyrics, which are from an old Palestinian song once used as an
Egyptian anthem.
   Most of the 650,000 residents of the Gaza Strip were kept under
curfew for a third day today as a deterrant to violence during the
four-day meeting in Algiers, Algeria of the Palestine National
Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile. The session opened Saturday.
   Curfews also were imposed in three West Bank villages, telephone
lines were cut to many areas in the occupied territories, and
Palestinians reported travel limitations and extra army patrols.
   The parliament-in-exile of the Palestine Liberation Organization
was expected to declare an independent Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip at its Tuesday session.
   Israel radio and army radio today reported the arrests of at
least 54 Palestinians who allegedly belonged to 16 guerrilla squads
and the destruction of several houses.
   ``This is a message to residents (of the occupied territories).
It clarifies that the army is there and continues to operate
efficiently,'' said a military official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The radio reports said that in the West Bank villages of Jaba and
Jalbun, soldiers detained 33 Palestinians on suspicion of belonging
to guerrilla groups that set forest fires and prevented Arab workers
from traveling to jobs in Israel.
   In Tulkarem, the army detained three Arab youths suspected of
throwing a firebomb at a military patrol six weeks ago that wounded
one soldier. Their houses were demolished, army radio said.
   In Hebron, security forces detained a Palestinian suspected of
stabbing and wounding a Jewish youth in Jerusalem in May, Israel
radio said.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, the army arrested 17
members of a squad belonging to Moslem fundamentalist Hamas (Zeal)
movement on suspicion of planting a bomb near a Jewish settlement.
The bomb did not explode.
   In east Jerusalem, security forces uncovered a squad identified
as belonging to Fatah, Yasser Arafat's mainstream PLO group, the
radio reports said. Squad members were said to be suspected of
planting a bomb that exploded in September near the house of Trade
Minister Ariel Sharon, causing no damage or injuries, and of
planning an attack on a police station.
   Another squad, based in the Jerusalem neighborhoods of Anabta and
Abu-Tor, belonged to the radical fundamentalist Islamic Jihad
movement, Israel radio said, and was suspected of organizing riots.
   Also in east Jerusalem, security forces were said to have
uncovered a guerrilla group belonging to Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Its members were suspected of
organizing riots and staging firebomb attacks in March and August.
   On Sunday, Israeli officials denounced the Palestine National
Council's expected move to approve a U.N. Resolution 242, which
implicitly recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   ``We will not negotiate with the PLO. It's not a problem of
definition and formulations of various positions. We'll not
negotiate with them because they're opposed to peace with Israel,''
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel radio.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, 43 miles north of Jerusalem,
troops killed a Palestinian on Sunday and another was wounded, said
an army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The death of 27-year-old Alam Hamtouli raised to 311 the number
of Palestinians killed in the uprising against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began Dec. 8. Eleven Israelis
also have died.

   Populist leader Benazir Bhutto drew
about 20,000 people to her final rally in the northwest frontier
city of Peshawar today as parties ended campaigns for Pakistan's
Nov. 16 national elections.
   In the eastern city of Lahore, her right-wing rivals of the
Islamic Democratic Alliance scheduled a campaign finale later in the
day.
   At Peshawar's Jinnah Park, Ms. Bhutto said her Pakistan People's
Party was a champion of workers and farmers while the nine-party
alliance, which contains loyalists of late President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq, has ``become an opposition alliance against the People's
Party.''
   As one of the only women in the election campaign, she alluded to
Moslem fundamentalists who oppose the prospect of a woman leader.
   ``As a woman I am your sister. You are my force _ your success is
my success,'' she told the crowd, which had waited up to three hours
for her 20-minute speech.
   Election officials have ordered all campaigning to cease at
midnight in order to establish calm. And the government said
thousands of security forces had gone on alert to quell any
political violence.
   Federal and provincial authorities announced the mobilization of
police, army and paramilitary forces to head off any trouble during
the lengthy voting period, which ends with provincial assembly
elections on Saturday.
   At stake Wednesday are 217 elected seats in the National Assembly
and on Saturday, 483 seats in the four provincial legislatures.
   The party that takes the most National Assembly seats will have
the first chance at forming a government.
   No reliable polls have been taken during the campaign.
   The election is seen mainly as a contest between Ms. Bhutto's
left-leaning party and Zia loyalists led by the Pakistan Muslim
League of former Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo and Punjab
state chief minister Nawaz Sharif.
   Ms. Bhutto is the daughter of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, who Zia ousted in a 1977 coup and had hanged two years later
for conspiracy to kill a political rival.
   Zia died in an Aug. 17 plane crash that investigators said
appeared to be sabotage. Also killed were the U.S. ambassador and 28
other people.
   Wednesday's vote is expected to be the first democratic election
in the nation of 107 million people since the 1973 polls that swept
the elder Bhutto to power. Bhutto was re-elected in 1977, but Zia
nullified the results after the coup, saying the vote was rigged.
   Despite their differences, the battle between the two largest
parties has been more one of symbols than of issues.
   Ms. Bhutto has abandoned her father's disastrous economic policy
of nationalizing industry and has pledged to continue close U.S.
ties and support for Afghanistan's anti-communist guerrillas. Zia
loyalists also pledge support for the guerrillas and close U.S. ties.
   Both sides favor Pakistan's nuclear research program for peaceful
purposes.
   Army convoys began moving troops today around Islamabad, the
capital, and adjacent Rawalpindi. However, officials said security
forces would be most vigilant in the southern cities of Hyderabad
and Karachi where nearly 300 people were killed in ethnic clashes
with a political undertone in September.
   Iftekhar Rashid, deputy police inspector-general for Sind
province, said about 50,000 military and police personnel would be
deployed in voting districts there, in addition to the Sindhi cities
of Sukkur and Larkana.
   Tension in the province has been mainly between Sindhi
separatists and Indian Moslem immigrants known as Mohajirs.
   Otherwise, the campaign has seen sporadic incidents of gunfire
and rock-throwing but no episodes of major political violence.
   Pakistan's 48 million eligible voters, three-fourths of them
illiterate, will be required to present a government identity card
to cast their ballots. Officials say about 93 percent had been
issued cards but Ms. Bhutto claimed the percentage was far less.
   She has called on party supporters without cards to demonstrate
at polling stations, but to remain peaceful.

<HEAD>Soviets To Make Second Shuttle Launch Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of spotlights illuminated the Soviet space
shuttle today as experts made final preparations for the second
attempt to launch the Buran, the Tass news agency said.
   The Soviet shuttle was scheduled to blast off on its first,
unmanned flight at 6 a.m. Moscow time Tuesday (10 p.m. tonight EST)
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia.
   Workers labored overnight under nearly 700 spotlights to prepare
the Buran, meaning Snowstorm, the official Tass news agency said.
Liquid fuels were to be added to its giant booster rocket 14 hours
before the flight, Tass said.
   The Buran is to make two orbits on fully automatic control and
then return to a 2.7-mile-long concrete runway a few miles away from
the launch site.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda today ran a front-page
picture of the shuttle attached to the rocket being transported to
the launch site.
   The first launch was scrubbed on Oct. 29, when an access arm did
not pull far enough away from the spaceship in the final minute
before blast-off.
   Computers automatically stopped the launch when the arm did not
retract.
   V. Filin, the deputy chief engineer for the booster rocket,
blamed the failure on ``overcomplicated construction'' of the joint
between the access tower and the spacecraft.
   Filin said an analysis showed it would take not three seconds to
fully retract the access arm, as had been expected, but 38 seconds.
   ``As a result of the analysis ... (access arm) became simpler but
more reliable, and that has been confirmed by experiments,'' Filin
said.

<TEXT>
   Authorities today freed more than
20 dissidents arrested to prevent them from attending an independent
seminar, and the Communist Party denounced them for waging
``psychological warfare,'' sources said.
   Eighteen people arrested between Thursday and Sunday were
released before dawn, according to dissident sources in Prague,
reached by telephone from Vienna.
   At least a dozen Westerners arrived in Prague on Friday to take
part in ``Czechoslovakia 88,'' a seminar on the country's history
and future.
   Four others who had planned to attend were refused visas,
according to the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation.
   Banned playwright Vaclav Havel, who eluded a police roundup of
dissidents Thursday and formally opened the seminar at a Prague
hotel, was detained Friday morning, the Prague sources said.
   Havel and his brother, Ivan, were also released today, said an
emigre source in Vienna.
   Three signatories of the Charter 77 human rights document were
held under house arrest over the weekend, the Vienna source said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In addition, seven other activists who tried to attend the
symposium were detained and interrogated over the weekend and
released, the source said.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said the dissidents tried to
use the planned symposium as a ``form of provocation, making use of
this for the cooperation of NATO countries for psychological
warfare.''
   The release of the dissidents came as Soviet Politburo member
Alexander N. Yakovlev arrived for talks with Communist Party leader
Milos Jakes, the official CTK news agency reported.
   Two weeks ago, Communist authorities used force to break up an
independent rally of 5,000 people and detained dozens of people.
   On Monday, the Rude Pravo daily branded the rally, called to mark
Czechoslovakia's 70th anniversary of independence, ``a provocative
action by anti-socialist forces.''
   In Vienna, the International Helsinki Federation for human rights
held a meeting on Sunday and today attended by Czechoslovak emigres,
including Jiri Pelikan, head of Czechoslovakia's state-run
television in 1968 during the popular reform movement that ended
with the Soviet-led invasion of Prague.
   Havel telephoned the Vienna seminar today, thanking the
participants for protesting the detentions this week, said a
participant, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Court Agreeds to Hear Connecticut Case on Beer Prices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to judge the
constitutionality of a Connecticut law aimed at assuring that beer
sold in the state costs no more than it does in three neighboring
states.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the 1984 law
regulating beer prices unduly interfered with interstate commerce.
   The justices in 1983 voted 5-3 in striking down as
unconstitutional a similar Connecticut law.
   The earlier law prohibited brewers from selling its brand of beer
in Connecticut at a price higher than the lowest price which it sold
beer in New York, Massachusetts or Rhode Island. Under that law, the
controlling price was adjusted each month.
   The retail price of beer generally has been higher in Connecticut
than in its neighbor states, and many Connecticut consumers buy beer
in one of the three neighboring states.
   The earlier law was struck down because it was deemed to affect
the price of beer outside Connecticut by locking beer prices in all
four states for one-month periods to the level posted in Connecticut.
   The 1984 Connecticut law, however, stated that the posted
Connecticut beer prices only had to reflect the lowest prices being
offered ``at the time of the posting.''
   The law did not prevent brewers from lowering prices in the three
neighboring states ``at any time during the calendar month covered
by such posting.''
   Beer brewers immediately challenged the 1984 law but a federal
trial judge upheld it.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June 13 reversed the
judge's ruling and struck down the law.
   ``The realities of beer price regulation in the border state area
show that Connecticut's statute inevitably exercises control over
the prices set for sales occurring wholly outside its territory,''
the appeals court ruled.
   ``Accordingly, we hold that the amended Connecticut beer price
affirmation provisions directly regulate interstate commerce in
violation of the Constitution,'' it added.
   The 2nd Circuit court's ruling was appealed by state officials
and in-state beer wholesalers.
   The cases are Healy vs. Beer Institute, 88-449, and Wine and
Spirits Wholesalers vs. Beer Institute, 88-513.

   Police believe white supremacist
``skinheads'' beat to death an Ethiopian man with a baseball bat.
   Mulugeta Seraw, a 27-year-old African immigrant, was attacked
outside his apartment early Sunday and died eight hours later at
Emanuel Hospital & Health Center.
   Police spokesman Dave Simpson said Seraw and two friends from
Ethiopia were jumped by five people who drove up in a car as Seraw's
friends dropped him off at home. One of the friends was hospitalized
in fair condition.
   Police sought five suspected ``skinheads,'' a group committed to
the use of violence against blacks, Jews and minorities. The three
young men and two young women had close-cropped hair and
military-style jackets, Simpson said.
   Seraw, a bus driver, moved to the United States seven years ago
and attended Portland State University, a relative said.
   Three teen-agers were convicted earlier this year in the March 10
beating of a Chinese-Singaporean man and the harassment of his
family. The victim said the attackers shouted racial slurs as he
left a restaurant.
   At the time of the attack, there were thought to be 25 to 30
skinheads active in the Portland area, according to the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which monitors the
activities of the radical right.

<HEAD>Louisiana Ruling Affirmed; Law Applies to Judicial Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that
the federal Voting Rights Act, designed to prevent racial
discrimination, applies to state judicial elections.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Louisiana
officials who said the law is not intended to cover the judicial
branch and could impair the independence of judges.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last February in
favor of blacks seeking to apply the voter rights law to the
election of Louisiana judges.
   The black registered voters said their voting power was diluted
unlawfully by a system in which two Louisiana Supreme Court justices
are elected at-large from a district comprised of four parishes.
   The state court has seven justices, five of whom are elected from
single-member districts. The remaining two are elected at large from
a district comprised of Orleans, St. Bernard, Plaquemines and
Jefferson parishes.
   Orleans Parish has a black population of 55 percent and accounts
for more than half the population of the four-parish judicial
district.
   The black voters filed a lawsuit to split the four parishes and
create two single-member districts, thus enhancing the chance that
Orleans Parish could elect a black justice to the state court.
   The blacks said the at-large system violates the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, which is designed to prevent dilution of black voting
strength.
   Louisiana officials argued that the law covers only
``representatives'' of the people, namely members of the legislative
and executive branches of government.
   The state officials, headed by Gov. Buddy Roemer, said:
   ``Judges should not be representatives. The larger the
constituency, the less parochial pressures can be brought to bear.
An advantage to at-large elections for judges is that judges can
make the difficult decisions without undue fear of dissatisfaction
in the electorate.''
   They added, ``Judges have but one constituency, the blindfolded
lady with scales, sword and shield.''
   But the 5th Circuit court said the Voting Rights Act is intended
to be a broad attack on racial discrimination in voting.
   ``Clearly, judges are candidates for public office,'' the appeals
court said. ``The act must be interpreted in a broad and
comprehensive manner in accordance with congressional intent to
combat racial discrimination of any kind in all voting practices and
procedures.''
   Judges are elected in most states. The Louisiana officials said
there are only eight states _ Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia _ where
judges are appointed.
   The Reagan administration supported the 5th Circuit court's
interpretation of the voting rights law.
   ``The natural reading of the term `representatives' does not
exclude elected judges in the context of the Voting Rights Act,''
the Justice Department said.
   Eight states urged the Supreme Court to hear Louisiana's appeal
and decide the issue. They are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Mississippi, North Carolina and Texas.
   The case is Roemer vs. Chisom, 88-327.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of notaries are duping
immigrants into paying thousands of dollars for flawed immigration
papers by posing as legal advisers, a state commission has found.
   Most of Florida's 350,000 notaries are abiding by their duty as
official witnesses to legal transactions, but some are preying on
immigrants, especially Hispanics, who need help changing their
immigration status, said several members of the Governor's Study
Commission on Notaries Public.
   These notaries capitalize on the fact that the Spanish ``notario
publico'' refers in most Latin American countries to a high-ranking
public official, qualified and licensed to give legal advice, the
commission said.
   Although these notaries charge high prices for their work, they
often provide nothing but worthless sheets of paper easily spotted
by immigration officers who can have the immigrant deported,
commission members said.
   ``This is absolutely the worst kind of fraud on the public
because it's aimed at the people who are least able to fend for
themselves,'' said Robert Sondak, a commission member and Miami
lawyer.

<TEXT>
   A South African official today described as
``glacial'' the progress in talks between Cuba, Angola and South
Africa aimed at achieving peace in southwest Africa.
   The main issue of the negotiations is a timetable for the
withdrawal of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, where
they are backing the Marxist government against Western-supported
rebels.
   A seond issue is establishing a framework for the independence of
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, which has been under South
African control for 73 years.
   One South African official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described progress in the latest round as ``glacial. Things are on
track, but on a very slow track.''
   However, a senior U.S. delegation member said Sunday that
progress had been made on the issue of Cuban troop pullout.
   The American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the negotiations have ``never been closer to agreement.''
   The three countries have agreed to hold an extra day of talks on
Tuesday.
   The U.S. official cited progress on the issue of a Cuban troop
withdrawal from Angola as one of the reasons to extend the
closed-door talks, which began Friday and had been scheduled to end
Sunday.
   ``If people can't go the extra mile, you could see a rapid change
of atmosphere,'' the American official said.
   The United States, which began mediating the negotiations in May,
proposed a plan in October that reportedly calls for a gradual
two-year withdrawal of Cuban troops. Cuba has sought a 2{-year
pullout timetable.
   South Africa has linked independence for South-West Africa, a
former German colony it took over after World War I, to a
satisfactory agreement on the Cuban withdrawal. It is ruling the
country in violation of a U.N. resolution demanding independence for
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The target date for the start of the pullout was reported to be
Jan. 1, the same day on which a U.N.-supervised plan for bringing
independence to South-West Africa would begin.

<HEAD>Court Will Hear Appeal of Arkansas Truck-Tax Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear an
appeal by trucking companies seeking refunds from Arkansas of taxes
they paid under a levy that was declared unconstitutional.
   The court said it will review a ruling that denied the companies
the refunds on grounds that doing so would require an unfair
retroactive application of decisions that invalidated the tax.
   At the same time, the court also agreed to study the refund issue
in a case from Florida involving taxes on alcoholic beverages. The
justices said they will hear an appeal by McKesson Corp., a
wholesale liquor distributor, seeking a refund for taxes paid under
a state levy that allegedly favored in-state companies.
   In the Arkansas case, the truck tax was declared unconstitutional
last March by the state supreme court.
   That court based its ruling on a U.S. Supreme Court decision in
June 1987 that struck down a similar tax in Pennsylvania on grounds
it discriminated unlawfully against interstate truckers.
   The Arkansas court ordered state officials to refund to
interstate truckers $4.9 million that had been held in a special
escrow fund created in August 1987.
   But the state court said the truckers were not entitled to
additional refunds on taxes the state collected but had not placed
in the separate fund.
   The state court said it would be unfair to apply the 1987 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling retroactively and award the interstate truckers
the additional refunds.
   ``The equities favor disallowing refund of the tax money already
paid into the state treasury,'' the state court said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 struck down a so-called flat tax
that Pennsylvania had imposed on all truck companies that used its
highways. The justices said the tax favored Pennsylvania companies
because they paid the same amount of money as interstate haulers,
even though the trucks owned by interstate companies traveled far
fewer miles on Pennsylvania highways.
   The American Trucking Association, which successfully challenged
the Pennsylvania tax, noted that the Arkansas Legislature repealed
that state's flat tax in October 1987 and replaced it with one that
imposed a rate of 2.5 cents per mile on all users of Arkansas
highways.
   But the new law allowed Arkansas officials to collect the
invalidated tax for another year.
   The trucking association did not specify the size of the
additional refunds it sought for its members. But the invalidated
Arkansas tax produced some $23 million in annual revenue.
   The case are McKesson Corp vs. Division of Alcoholic Beverages
and American Truck Associations vs. Smith, 88-325.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today
convened an unusual gathering of the Communist Party and
government's top officials and told them the country's farm problem
is the most critical one they face.
   The Tass news agency said Gorbachev addressed a gathering in the
industrial city of Orel, about 230 miles south of Moscow, that
included national party and government leaders, officials of the
state-run media and provincial Communist Party chiefs.
   The Soviet leader called the Soviet Union's food supply
difficulties ``the most important problem of the internal policy of
the Soviet Union,'' official Radio Moscow said.
   Although Gorbachev frequently goes on trips outside of Moscow to
push his reform effort, it was rare for him to call a large
gathering of top national and regional officials outside of the
Kremlin.
   The inclusion of media officials and regional party leaders
indicated the importance of the gathering. Among the Kremlin
officials who attended the gathering were Politburo member Yegor K.
Ligachev, formerly regarded as the No. 2 leader but shifted at the
end of September to the agriculture portfolio.
   Ligachev had not attended a mid-October meeting in the Central
Committee on agriculture.
   Gorbachev said improvements in the Orel region's agricultural
production in the past three years prove the value of his drive for
greater local control, Tass said.
   The improvements indicate ``much depends on the initiative, and
independence of local organs of power to rule and decide practical
problems of the agricultural sector,'' Tass quoted him as saying.
   The Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee will meet
in February to discuss plans to let families and other small groups
of farmers rent land from giant collective and state farms on
long-term leases, Gorbachev said.
   The lead article of the government newspaper Izvestia this
evening said the Orel region had increased its sales of meat by
one-third and milk by 17 percent in the past three years. It ran its
story under a headline ``Lease Contracts Return the Land to Its
Master.''
   Tass said the Orel conference will consider ``pressing issues''
of Gorbachev's reform effort, primarily what the Communist Party
must do to improve food supplies.
   ``The participants will familiarize themselves with the
experience of introducing new relations of production and economic
relations and expediting social progress in the countryside, which
has been gained in the Orel region,'' Tass said.
   Soviet farming is plagued by low productivity, frequent disregard
for the land and machinery, waste in shipping and storage, and few
cultural and social amenities in the countryside.
   Soviet food stores are frequently empty of anything but basic
goods.
   Gorbachev has said that improving the food supply is one of his
top priorities, and is pushing for a shift to lease contracts in
farming.
   Officials say such a system instills in farmers greater care for
the land and makes them more efficient than other farmers.

   Police arrested a newspaper editor today
after he published reports accusing Lesotho's finance minister of
improper dealings with an Italian company, his lawyers said.
   Police declined to comment on the arrest of Johnny Maseko, 29,
editor of The Mirror, an independent newspaper published weekly in
the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho.
   Maseko was charged two weeks ago with criminal defamation for a
series of articles published in September about Finance Minister
Evaristus Sekhonyana.
   Maseko appeared briefly in court on Friday but did not plead. He
was released on bail of $40.
   His articles said Sekhonyana in 1981 authorized the transfer of
millions of dollars into a Swiss bank account for an Italian
construction firm operating in Lesotho.
   The government subsequently accused the Italian firm, Banco, of
failing to complete building projects that had already been funded.
Company officials fled the country and the firm was liquidated.
   Lesotho is completely surrounded by South Africa. Its 1.6 million
people are ruled by a six-man military council that took power in a
1986 coup, ousting leftist Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan.
   Sekhonyana was the only government minister who kept his post
after the coup.

   Massachusetts' highest court will review an
extraordinary ruling by a judge who threw out a jury verdict of
guilty of murder, declared the defendant innocent and alleged
possible misconduct by the prosecution.
   A Superior Court jury last month convicted Charles W. Doucette
Jr., 28, of killing a fellow mechanic who owed him money in 1987.
   Two days later, Judge John T. Ronan declared Doucette innocent,
and he was freed, although he is awaiting trial on a charge of
intimidating a witness, his former fiancee, in the trial.
   ``I dare say these walls have never heard such untruths. The
system has been abused. The jurors not only lost their way, but, sad
to say, the truth got lost along the way,'' Ronan said in
overturning the verdict.
   Ronan, 58, a Superior Court judge for 15 years, ordered a
transcript of the trial sent to Attorney General James M. Shannon to
investigate possible misconduct, including perjury, by police and
prosecutors.
   District Attorney Kevin M. Burke's only public statement was that
Ronan ``abused his discretion.''
   ``No matter what (defense attorney John J.) Jennings and the
judge said about us, the jury cleared us when it came back with a
guilty finding,'' said Salem Police Lt. Wilfred F. Garrette Jr.
   Ronan told the Boston Globe that based on the evidence, ``it was
simply impossible to find Doucette guilty of murder beyond a
reasonable doubt.''

<HEAD>Inquest Opens Into 1982 Killings of Unarmed Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inquest into the 1982 killing
of three unarmed guerrillas by police opened today with its scope
sharply narrowed by a government order citing national security.
   An 11-member inquest jury in Craigavon, 19 miles southwest of
Belfast, was to establish the circumstances surrounding the shooting
deaths of Gervase McKerr, Eugene Toman and Sean Burns. The Irish
Republican Army has acknowledged the three as members.
   A detective told the inquest that police had been told before the
shootings that the IRA was planning to kill a member of the security
forces, and that Toman and Burns, both 21, were thought to be armed.
   One hour after the hearing began, a lawyer for the family of
McKerr, 31, walked out in protest when the coroner heading the
inquest refused to summon three officers to testify.
   Attorney Pat Finnucane said he would ask the Northern Ireland
High Court to order the officers to answer questions at the inquest.
   The three IRA men were shot dead in a police ambush on Nov. 11,
1982 as they drove through County Armagh, a hotbed of guerrilla
activity geared primarily toward assassinating police officers.
   Three more unarmed Roman Catholics, two of them guerrillas and
one a teen-ager, died in two other police ambushes in County Armagh
over the next month.
   At first, police said all the deaths occurred in the normal
course of anti-terrorist warfare. But subsequent evidence suggested
the killings were deliberate and avoidable, and that police were
operating an alleged ``shoot-to-kill policy'' in the British
province.
   The overwhelmingly Catholic IRA is fighting to rid
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland of British rule and unite it
with the Irish Republic.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, Britain's top official in
the province, has barred the inquest from investigating certain
circumstances of the shootings which he considers would be
``detrimental to the national security.''
   King's order, signed last week, expressed concern about
jeopardizing present and future counter-terrorist operations.
   A screen, heavily guarded by policemen, concealed the identities
of police officers giving testimony.
   Allegations that police systematically distorted the
circumstances of the killings culminated in a 1986 police inquiry
which uncovered evidence that at least 11 police officers were
involved in a conspiracy to pervert justice.
   The investigating officer, John Stalker, deputy chief constable
of the Manchester police force, was abruptly dismissed from the
two-year inquiry in May 1986 and suspended for ``disciplinary
offenses.''
   The allegations of misconduct turned out to be trivial and a
police watchdog panel cleared Stalker. But he was not restored to
the Northern Ireland inquiry into the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
province's overwhelmingly Protestant police force.
   Critics say it reaffirms the belief that British rule in Northern
Ireland is unjust toward the Catholic minority.
   Inquests into the three other killings are expected to be held at
the end of the first inquest.

   George Bush, seeking to calm world
financial market fears about his forthcoming presidency, said today
that he will continue the Reagan administration policy of
coordinated intervention with U.S. allies in exchange markets when
major currencies rise or fall too quickly.
   The president-elect sought to minimize the weakening of the
dollar against the Japanese yen and German mark and the plunge of
the stock market since his election last Tuesday, saying ``These
gyrations happen.''
   ``Exchange market stability is the key ... Nobody is going to peg
the dollar to any existing currency,'' he said in an informal
meeting with reporters on the beach.
   Questions about the markets' behavior have dogged the vice
president during his post-election Florida beach vacation. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials fell almost 80 points last week,
including a 47-point drop Friday that was partially triggered by
fears over erosion of the dollar's value abroad.
   Asked if he would favor lowering the dollar against foreign
currencies as has been suggested by his sometime economic adviser
Martin Feldstein, Bush said: ``The policy in effect is the
administration policy built around policy coordination and exchange
market stability ... That's the policy of the administration.''
   For the past three years, the United States and its economic
allies have had a policy of coordinated intervention in exchange
markets when major currencies rise or fall too rapidly. The central
banks of the major industrial countries buy or sell dollars,
depending on whether they are trying to counter a rise or a fall in
its value.
   Between September 1985 and February 1987, the policy was to push
the value of the dollar down. Since February, the policy has been to
maintain stability of exchange rates through a ``managed float''
within established unofficial trading ranges.
   Earlier, the co-chairman of Bush's transition team said that
cutting the federal budget deficit would be ``priority one'' for the
incoming administration.
   ``I do think we've got to turn first to the deficit problem as
soon as we undertake a new administration,'' Craig Fuller, Bush's
chief of staff, said from Washington on the NBC-TV ``Today'' program.
   Fuller, asked in the interview about investors' concerns, said
the Bush White House is moving quickly to address the deficit.
   ``We've already had some good contacts with the (House Speaker
James Wright, D-Texas). I expect to have further contacts with the
speaker. I think you'll have people who have a great deal of
experience working with each other willing to sit down early and
talk about these concerns,'' Fuller said.
   Investors should understand, he said, that no major differences
in spending priorities from the Reagan administration are planned.
   ``I think I have to emphasize that priority one is going to be
getting this deficit under control. That suggests that we're not
going to rush out with large spending programs. And I think both
Republicans and Democrats understand the significance of that,''
Fuller said.
   Wright, without mentioning the deficit, said in a separate
interview on the same program:
   ``I think we can find a lot of common ground'' with Bush and that
``...there are many areas in which we can work together, and should,
and we ought to reach out to seek those opportunities in every way
we can.''
   Bush also hinted today that he might have announcements on
appointees to his administration when he returns to Washington this
week.
   He rejected a report suggesting that James A. Baker III, whom
Bush has selected as secretary of State, would wield power as a
``deputy president.''
   ``You haven't heard that here,'' he told reporters. He said Baker
is a close confident, but ``I simply would look here for guidance on
who's going to be calling the shots other than the new president.''
   On reports that a three-person chief-of-staff arrangement was
under consideration, Bush said, ``Stay tuned. I'll have
announcements on that pretty soon.''
   He revealed that New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu would join Bush
this evening at the president-elect's oceanfront vacation spot.
   No other political associates have visited Bush here since he
arrived Thurday, but Bush laughlingly cautioned reporters, ``Don't
read into it anything about Sununu.''
   Fuller said Sunday that Bush plans to name his top economic
advisers later this week.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is widely expected to stay on
with Bush and former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard G. Darman has
been reported to be the choice for budget director.
   Bush sidestepped a question about whether he would name a woman
to his Cabinet, saying he did not want to impose quotas, but that
``I will anticipate there will be representation in the Cabinet.''
   On another matter, Bush rejected allegations that the
government's foreclosure warning to 80,000 farmers was held up until
after the election.
   ``I don't believe there's any political motivation related to
agriculural policies at all,'' he said.
   He declined to comment on the merits of the foreclosure action,
saying, ``I will get briefed on that when I get back.''
   Bush is scheduled to return to Washington early Tuesday. His
schedule for the week includes meetings with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

   Former Prime Minister Takeo Miki, who sought to
reform the governing party's economic policies after Prime Minister
Kakuei Tanaka resigned amid a financial scandal, died today at age
81.
   Miki served in Japan's House of Representatives for a record 51
consecutive years beginning in 1937, and as prime minister from 1974
to 1976.
   Miki, who studied at the University of California at Berkeley and
Japan's Meiji University, spoke against the possibility of war with
the United States in 1938, when militarists in the government tried
to suppress such sentiments.
   In the 1970s, as leader of a small faction in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, he was a compromise choice for the
premiership after Tanaka's resignation in 1974.

<HEAD>Former Group Home Administrator's Shooting Spree Ends in Suicide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who shot to death one person and
wounded three others before killing himself wanted revenge for his
firing as an administrator of a home for the retarded, state police
say.
   ``He knew his victims by their first names and asked for them
specifically when he came to their home,'' state police spokesman
Steve McCausland said of Alan Matterson, 36, of Cumberland.
   ``He was broken man'' as a result of the investigation that
prompted the state to seize control of the group home and which led
to Matterson's dismissal in 1987, McCausland said Sunday night.
   Matterson was fired from his job at the former Androscoggin
Community Home in Mechanic Falls, a home for 14 mentally handicapped
adults. It is now called Main Street Mechanic Falls and is under new
management.
   Police said Matterson shot the home's former bookkeeper, two
state officials who had been involved in regulating such homes and
one of their relatives. One victim remains hospitalized in serious
condition.
   The series of shootings spanned about 100 miles in New Hampshire
and Maine in less than four hours Saturday night and early Sunday,
McCausland said.
   Matterson posed as a police officer during at least one of the
shootings, he said. A police hat, handcuffs, flashlight and other
items, along with two pistols, were recovered from Matterson's car.
   The shootings began in Milton Mills, N.H., where the former
bookkeeper, Howard Hedegard, 43, and his sister-in-law, Patricia
Collins, 27, of Derry, N.H., were shot at Hedegard's home.
   Hedegard said he peered out the window, saw Matterson at the door
and knew something was wrong.
   ``He asked me to come outside and I refused,'' said Hedegard.
Then Matterson turned and fired through the window, wounding
Hedegard in the chin. A second shot took off the tip of his finger.
   Collins received a slight leg wound, and both were treated at
Frisbee Memorial Hospital in Rochester.
   McCausland said the next stop was in Poland, Maine, about 50
miles east, where William Twarog, 44, a regional administrator for
the state Mental Retardation Bureau, was shot dead at his home.
   It was Twarog's job to monitor private group homes such as the
one Matterson had administered.
   After that, McCausland said, Matterson drove to Topsham, Maine,
where he shot Louis T. Dorogi, 46, director of licensing for nursing
homes in the state Human Services Department, in the kitchen of his
home.
   Dorogi underwent emergency surgery at Brunswick Regional Memorial
Hospital and is in serious condition. In his state post, he was in
charge of inspection of state-affiliated homes for compliance with
Medicaid standards, said Susan Parker, commissioner of Mental Health
and Retardation.
   Parker said management and financial problems came to light at
the group home while Matterson was administrator. ``Alan had trouble
keeping track of the finances,'' she said.
   The search for the gunman began after New Hampshire state police
issued a report on the first shootings.
   A Gardiner, Maine, police officer spotted his car and two state
police cruisers took up the chase at speeds to 90 mph.
   State troopers said they saw him brandish a gun and shoot
himself, said McCausland. That sent his car careening off the road,
where it became briefly airborne before it landed in a field.
   State officials were at a loss for an explanation.
   ``I am totally shocked,'' said Parker. ``The unfairness of it all
makes me furious.''
   Others said they had thought Matterson might one day seek
vengeance against those he held responsible for his dismissal.
   ``People thought there would be some attempt to hurt people, but
not physically. Most people thought he would sue,'' said Peter
Kowalski, executive director of John F. Murphy Homes, the non-profit
organization in Lewiston that took over the facility.

<HEAD>Indiana Ruling Affirmed; Husbands Can't Prevent Wives' Abortions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to give
husbands the legal power to prevent their wives from having
abortions.
   The justices, without comment, let stand an Indiana Supreme Court
decision that a husband has no right to interfere with his wife's
constitutional right to abort her pregnancy.
   The court also told deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
and his wife, Imelda, they must turn over subpoenaed records to a
federal grand jury.
   The state court's ruling in the abortion case last July was based
directly on past rulings by the nation's highest court.
   Erin Andrew Conn of Elkhart, Ind., went to court early last
summer in an attempt to prevent his estranged wife, Jennifer, from
having an abortion. She was about six weeks pregnant at the time.
   A state trial judge issued a temporary order barring Mrs. Conn
from having the operation performed, but a state appeals court threw
out that order.
   ``Erin has no right to veto Jennifer's decision ... as such
decision concerns only her,'' the appeals court ruled.
   The Indiana Supreme Court, acting on Conn's subsequent appeal,
then adopted the appeals court ruling as its own.
   The state courts said Conn's attempt to block his wife's abortion
was prohibited by prior Supreme Court rulings dating back to 1973,
when a landmark decision by the justices legalized abortion.
   In 1976, the court struck down a Missouri law requiring spousal
consent before a woman could obtain an abortion during the first 12
weeks of her pregnancy.
   After the state Supreme Court ruling, Conn sought emergency help
from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice John Paul
Stevens. Both denied his request, and the injunction prohibiting
Mrs. Conn's abortion was lifted last July 22.
   She subsequently obtained an abortion. The Conns are in the midst
of divorce proceedings. Conn's attorney, James Bopp of Terre Haute,
said a decree is expected within days.
   In the appeal acted on today, Conn said the 1973 and 1976 rulings
did not preclude state courts from taking a husband's rights into
consideration ``on a case-by-case basis.''
   ``The father has fundamental rights and interests in his unborn
child which should be judicially considered, on the facts of this
case, along with the rights and interests of his wife in aborting
their child,'' lawyers for Conn argued.
   The appeal, which did not directly attack the court's previous
abortion decisions, said consideration of a husband's objections is
justified by ``the traditional balancing approved by this court
where competing rights collide.''
   Lawyers for Mrs. Conn called the appeal ``entirely without
merit.''
   ``Every appellate court to consider the issue has held that a man
does not have the right to a court order enjoining a woman from
exercising her abortion right,'' they said. ``This has been true in
cases where the man seeking the court order was the woman's
husband.''
   The case is Conn vs. Conn, 88-347.
   In other cases, the court:
   _Denied the Marcoses' emergency request that they not be
compelled to abide by a grand jury's demand for financial and other
records related to an investigation of the couple, charged with
looting their nation's treasury of more than $100 million.
   A federal judge in New York, where the grand jury is meeting,
ruled Aug. 11 that the Marcoses must honor the subpoenas and no
longer have immunity as ruler and first lady of a foreign country.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling Oct.
19.
   _Let stand an appellate ruling that the federal Voting Rights
Act, designed to prevent racial discrimination, applies to state
judicial elections.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Louisiana
officials who said the law is not intended to cover the judicial
branch and could impair the independence of judges.
   _Agreed to consider the constitutionality of a Connecticut law
aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs no more than it
does in three neighboring states.

<HEAD>Opposition Raises Questions About Botha Link To Anti-Communist Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition parties today
demanded an inquiry into why the state-run television company helped
finance an anti-communist film on which President P.W. Botha's
daughter was production coordinator.
   The film, ``Back To Freedom,'' opened in South Africa last week
and has been panned by critics as an amateurish propaganda exercise.
   The far-right Conservative Party called for appointment of a
commission to investigate the South African Broadcasting Corp.'s
involvement in the production.
   Parliament member Dave Dalling, spokesman for the liberal
Progressive Federal Party, said the film company involved was owned
by a friend of President Botha's. Dalling asked who authorized the
SABC to provide more than $1 million to finance the film.
   Botha's daughter, Rozanne, was production coordinator of the
film, but in the credits her last name is given as ``Both'' instead
of Botha. The film's scriptwriter, a university professor, also used
a pseudonym.
   The controversy over the film was sparked by reports in Sunday
newspapers that the Cabinet minister formerly in charge of the SABC,
Alvyn Schlebusch, had recommended the corporation withhold the final
installment of its payment to Mimosa Films, more than $200,000,
because the film was substandard.
   According to the reports, President Botha overruled Schlebusch
and ordered the payment be made.
   Schlebusch subsequently resigned. The Cabinet minister who now
oversees the SABC, Stoffel van der Merve, said the broadcasting
company's involvement in the film was legitimate.
   The SABC, in return for its financing, was to get all profits
from domestic box-office receipts and half of overseas profits.
   The movie plot is based loosely on the current civil war in
Angola, in which South African-backed rebels are fighting the
Soviet- and Cuban-supported troops of Angola's Marxist government.
   South African military equipment was used in the film, and dozens
of soldiers reportedly served as extras. The Sunday Times newspaper
said the script was believed to have been submitted to Angolan rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi for approval.

   The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 today that the
state of Arkansas can hold a second sentencing trial for a man
mistakenly sent to prison as a habitual offender.
   The court said a second trial would not violate the Fifth
Amendment's double jeopardy clause, which protects a defendant from
undergoing trial more than once for any single offense.
   In this case, Johnny Lee Nelson pleaded guilty in 1982 of
burglary and theft for taking $45 from a vending machine.
   A jury sentenced him to 20 years in prison after prosecutors
introduced evidence of four prior felony convictions. Four felony
convictions triggers Arkansas' habitual offender law, which allows
sentences of 20 years to 40 years compared to 5 years to 20 years
for non-habitual offenders.
   Unbeknownst to the prosecutor or defense, one of Nelson's
convictions had been pardoned. But it wasn't until more than three
years later, after a petition filed by Nelson from prison, that a
court-ordered review discovered the error.
   A lower federal court invalidated the habitual offender sentence,
and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling, which
barred a retrial under the habitual offender law.
   The state appealed, seeking to have the sentence reinstated by
introducig evidence of another conviction not introduced at the
previous trial.
   The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, reversed the lower courts. Rehnquist said ``it has long
been settled'' that the double jeopardy clause does not prevent a
retrial when a defendant wins a reversal due to ``some error in the
proceedings leading to conviction.''
   ``Permitting retrial in this instance is not the sort of
government oppression at which the double jeopardy clause is aimed;
rather, it serves the interest of the defendant'' by affording him a
fair adjudication, Rehnquist said.
   He added, ``Our holding today thus merely recreates the situation
that would have been obtained if the trial court had excluded the
evidence of the conviction because of the showing of a pardon.''
   In a dissent, Justice Thurgood Marshall said a retrial is
``squarely foreclosed'' in the case. He noted that the high court
ruled in 1978 that states may not retry defendants when prosecutors
initially failed to present sufficient evidence of guilt.
   He said if the state had offered proof of three convictions and a
blank piece of paper to prove a fourth, ``no one would doubt that
Arkansas had produced insufficient evidence and that the double
jeopardy clause barred retrial.''
   Joining Rehnquist in the majority were Justices Byron R. White,
John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony
M. Kennedy. Marshall was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and
Harry A. Blackmun.
   The case is Lockhart vs. Nelson, 87-1277.

   Along with congratulations, the nation's Roman
Catholic bishops sent President-elect George Bush a reminder today
they will speak out firmly on national issues and not ``only in
praise and appreciation'' of White House policies.
   As their annual meeting got under way, the bishops also showed
frustration bordering on irritation on an intra-church matter, a
late intervention by the Vatican that will keep them from voting on
guidelines for resolving disputes with theologians.
   The Vatican action _ based on an objection that the guidelines
suggest equality between theologians and bishops _ ``might be
perceived as confrontational or as belittling the episcopal
conference (of bishops), which I know is not intended,'' said
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago. He and other bishops said the
complaint should have come much earlier.
   The vote on the guidelines was put off until next June, but the
bishops will get another chance this week to publicly discuss their
not-always-harmonious relationship with the Vatican. A vote is
scheduled for Wednesday on a proposal concerning the authority of
bishops' conferences.
   At the beginning of today's opening session, the president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop John May of St.
Louis, declared they would stand with Pope John Paul II ``in
denouncing injustices and actions which foster disrespect for human
life, from abortion to the death penalty.''
   The reference is a pointed one since President-elect Bush
campaigned for the presidency as a vigorous defender of capital
punishment _ portraying rival Michael Dukakis as weak for taking the
other side _ as well as a foe of abortion.
   In recent years, several of the bishops' major statements have
stirred controversy outside as well as inside the church,
particularly as they took issue with Reagan administration policies
on nuclear arms, Latin America and the U.S. economy.
   ``We are sometimes criticized for being too concerned about the
world, of pursuing an agenda that in the minds of some critics is
secular, leftist or in some way `ideological,''' May said. But he
said actions and statements by the pope have shown the bishops it is
not possible to have ``too much social consciousness.''
   The bishops this week will consider a number of seemingly secular
proposals, including one calling on Congress to ease a 1986 law and
give legal standing to many more undocumented Hispanic workers.
   May indicated that if U.S. Catholics once kept quiet out of fear
they would be accused of disloyalty to their government, such
attitudes are gone.
   ``Catholics in America have long since passed the time when we
must prove ourselves to this country which we love,'' he said. ``Now
is the time to translate our teaching into action, to build a more
just nation and a more peaceful world.''
   May took a considerably more conciliatory stance on the main
intra-church matter the bishops will debate and vote on this week _
a proposal that they reject a draft Vatican document that appears to
undercut the theological authority of bishops' organizations such as
theirs.
   The bishops' proposed response uses such phrases as ``rigid and
confusing'' and ``overly defensive and negative'' to describe the
Vatican draft and says it seems to be ``pretending to be a study but
with its conclusions already determined.''
   Still, May said the bishops' response has been portrayed
incorrectly by the news media ``as if it signaled some sort of
struggle with the Holy See. With all due respect for the creative
imaginations of certain writers, this is simply false.''
   May said the bishops were simply responding to the Vatican's
invitation for comment.
   He said it is ``always a thankless office'' to give criticism,
even when asked. And he said, ``There has been no action by the body
this year that is more profoundly obediential and respectful than
the work on this document.''
   The pope has publicly supported the bishops' national pastoral
letters on nuclear arms and the U.S. economy. But there also has
been criticism from top officials in the Vatican, who ask for whom
the bishops were speaking, and on what authority. Other critics have
suggested the bishops were taking on issues that were none of their
business.
   But May said, ``Our people need to hear that the work we have
begun on `social issues' _ whether on nuclear policy, human rights
or advocacy for the unborn, the poor and the homeless _ will
continue.''
   Noting that the 300 or so bishops were meeting in the nation's
capital, May said it was appropriate to congratulate Bush and to
assure him ``of the bishops' continuing commitment to the
commonweal.''
   ``But our voices will not be heard only in praise and
appreciation,'' he said.
   Among specific issues this week, the bishops will:
   _Hear a report from a special committee drafting a statement on
AIDS. An earlier document drew fire from some bishops, partly
because it seemed to approve condoms as a way of preventing the
deadly disease.
   _Call for greater religious liberty in Eastern Europe, saying
that despite the emergence of Soviet ``glasnost,'' or openness,
``intimidation of religious dissenters continues.''

   PLO leaders today drafted a historic
declaration to be presented to the group's parliament-in-exile that
implicitly recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   Several conference sources said they expected up to 85 percent of
the 450 members of the Palestine National Council to endorse the
document.
   The council's political committee met behind closed doors to
debate the wording of another part of the declaration, a commitment
distancing the Palestine Liberation Organization from terrorism,
conference sources said.
   The source, who are on the drafting committee, said they did not
expect any differences over the draft, but would not elaborate. They
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The declaration sets out a new political strategy by endorsing
U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 _ which recognizes Israel's
right to exist _ thus satisfying one of Washington's key conditions
for dealing with the PLO. The resolution also calls for Israel's
withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In Washington, President Reagan said today that if the council
does accept Resolution 242, ``that would be some progress.'' But he
said ``there are other problems that remain to be solved'' before a
breakthrough in the Arab stance toward Israel would be achieved. He
did not elaborate.
   ``Apparently there has been an indication they're willing to
abide by 242,'' Reagan said in response to a reporter's question.
``I hope that is true because that would be some progress.''
   On Tuesday, the council is expected to end its extraordinary
four-day meeting with a declaration of independence for the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have for 11 months been
revolting against Israel's 21-year occupation.
   In a radio interview today, PLO chief Yasser Arafat called the
council meeting a ``turning point in the course of the Palestinian
struggle that will also influence events and developments in the
Arab world.''
   He praised the council for what he called its ``democratic
spirit'' and criticized opponents of the latest Palestinian moves
towards peace without mentioning any specific names or groups as
``swimmers against the current of history.'' The Radio Monte Carlo
interview was monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   The independence declaration, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman
and other officials said, already has been drafted. Another draft
document proposes the formation of a provisional government to
negotiate peace.
   In closed-door committee meetings, there had been strong
opposition to Resolution 242 from the PLO's Marxist-oriented groups,
particularly George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
   But Habash's faction, the second-largest of the eight groups
comprising the PLO, agreed Sunday to go ``with the rule of the
majority,'' a spokesman said.
   Arafat had hoped for a consensus on Resolution 242 to avert
further splits within his guerrilla movement and in the national
council, which first assembled in 1964.
   President Reagan, asked if he was pleased with the PLO leaders'
action, said Sunday in Washington, ``We're still looking at that;
that's all I can say.''
   In another development, Abul Abbas, the Palestinian who
masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille
Lauro, made light of the killing of New Yorker Leon Klinghoffer
during the ordeal, the New York Times reported in today's editions.
   Klinghoffer, a 69-year-old wheelchair-bound passenger, was shot
and pushed overboard.
   ``Maybe he was trying to swim for it,'' the Times quoted Abbas as
telling reporters outside the hall where the council is meeting.
Abbas compared the hijacking to driving a car and said ``You have an
accident on the way. Accidents happen.''
   Arafat is hoping political moderation coupled with increasing
sympathy for the Palestinian cause brought on by the Palestinian
uprising will eventually lead to an international peace conference
on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   The conflict in the occupied territories has left at least 311
Palestinians and 11 Israelis dead since it began Dec. 8.
   The national council's acceptance of Resolution 242 would meet
one of the conditions for U.S. recognition of the PLO.
   Previously, the PLO had explicitly rejected Resolution 242, which
calls for Israel's withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967 and
for the right of all states in the region to live in peace within
secure and recognized borders _ an implicit recognition of Israel.

   Democratic Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay, the
loser by a narrow margin to Republican Connie Mack in the race for
the U.S. Senate, has demanded a recount in five of the state's
biggest counties.
   The protest filed Sunday was accompanied by charts showing that
in the contested counties, a much larger percentage of people than
usual voted for president but cast no vote in the Senate race Nov. 8.
   The recount is being sought in Hillsborough, Dade, Broward,
Orange and Palm Beach counties, where MacKay contends about 170,000
votes were not reported. MacKay won all five counties but by smaller
margins than his staff anticipated.
   Attorneys for Mack said they will ask the canvassing boards in
the five counties to reject MacKay's request.
   Mack attorney Gregg Thomas said the drop-off in voters
participating in the Senate race could have been caused by the
position of the race on the ballot, people being turned off by the
``hotly contested race'' or confusion over the similarity in the
candidates' names.
   MacKay attorney Steve Uhlfelder said the congressman isn't yet
alleging fraud.
   Nearly complete but unofficial returns compiled by The Associated
Press show Mack with 2,044,575 votes and MacKay with 2,014,924.
   The Panama City News-Herald reported Sunday that Bay County, the
last county remaining, had completed counting absentee ballots,
giving Mack 2,048,356 votes to 2,016,828 votes for MacKay, a margin
of 31,528 for Mack.
   If the recounts disclose potential fraud or gross irregularities,
Uhlfelder said, MacKay has until 10 days after the election to file
a lawsuit contesting the vote.
   Mack campaign spokesman Mark Mills said further pursuit of a
recount by MacKay ``looks like sour grapes'' and could ``tarnish his
good reputation'' in the state.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Marshals Service, with the aid of a
computerized tracking system, announced today it had hunted down and
arrested 218 drug fugitives in a 10-week operation that was so
successful it paid for itself with $1.3 million in seized cash and
property.
   The operation cost $1.1 million and was launched Aug. 27 when 105
deputy marshals were assigned full-time to special units.
   The 218 fugitives all are accused of various drug-related
offenses, including 84 alleged drug lab operators, drug financiers,
major suppliers or lead figures in drug organizations, said marshals
service director Stanley Morris.
   Morris said the operation, called Warrant Apprehension Narcotics
Team or WANT-II, is an attempt to ``add a bottom line'' to law
enforcement efforts targeting drug traffickers. The number of
federal drug fugitives grew by nearly 25 percent in the last two
years, with total outstanding warrants rising to more than 4,200.
   ``Intensified anti-drug activities by DEA, the FBI, the U.S.
Customs Service and other investigative agencies have led to an
increasing number of charges filed against drug traffickers,''
Morris said at a news conference. ``Consequently, the number of
narcotics fugitives _ those who avoid arrest or fail to appear in
court _ has increased significantly in the past few years.''
   A key to the project's success was a special computerized system
called ``Scorecard,'' a computer program capable of storing and
sorting through a vast quantity of data from fugitive case files to
develop investigative leads for the teams trying to locate the drug
figures.
   The leads developed through Scorecard were passed along to deputy
marshals and local police who checked out the information and made
the arrests.
   WANT-II operated from Galveston, Texas; New Orleans; Mobile,
Ala.; Jacksonville and Tampa, Fla., and Miami, with a headquarters
unit at El Paso, Texas.
   Seized during the operation was a $127,000 Ferrari Testarossa
from accused drug trafficker Nicholas Hunter-Reay, who was arrested
in Miami.
   Hunter-Reay, who vanished after his 1979 federal indictment in
California for alleged cocaine distribution, was living comfortably
under an assumed name in Delray Beach, Fla. He was a member of the
Broward County Sheriff's Advisory Council when he was arrested Sept.
15.
   Arrested Sept. 25 in the operation was Francisco Penaranda,
indicted in 1985 as the kingpin of an international drug trafficking
conspiracy that allegedly brought huge quantities of cocaine from
Colombia into the United States and Canada.
   Also caught up in the operation were Trepop Pidech and Hobart
Dunn, indicted for allegedly masterminding the laundering of nearly
$3 billion in profits from the Penaranda network.

   Wearing a button proclaiming ``Life
begins at 40,'' Prince Charles celebrated his 40th birthday today
with the inner-city young people whose cause he has championed
during his long wait to ascend the British throne.
   Obviously enjoying the daylong public celebrations, the prince
launched a nationwide appeal to raise $72 million for the Prince's
Youth Business Trust, which helps unemployed young people establish
their own businesses. The government has agreed to match donations
up to that level.
   To cheers and laughter, Charles delivered a parody of some of his
own more eccentric interests, particularly the notion that he
regularly consults the plants in his gardens.
   He said that before he came to Birmingham, ``an entire bed of
old-fashioned roses ... were forced to listen to my demented
ramblings on the meaning of the universe as I sat cross-legged in
the lotus position on the gravel paths in front of them.''
   Charles said the ``Life begins at 40'' button was a present from
his two young sons, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4.
   As he crosses into middle age, the heir to the British throne,
who has no constitutionally defined job, has carved his own role _
as crusader for the underprivileged and protector of the environment.
   On the eve of the prince's birthday, one of his close associates,
Tom Shebbeare, said Charles is irritated by the news media's
obsession with peddling what he called ``tittle-tattle'' and fiction
about Charles' private life, which he said distracts from the
prince's serious work.
   Hundreds of well-wishers cheered and sang ``Happy Birthday, Dear
Charlie'' when the heir to the British throne arrived in Birmingham.
   Later today, he was to attend a glittering Buckingham Palace ball.
   As Charles was en route to Birmingham, the Defense Ministry
awarded him the double promotion. The ranks are ceremonial; the
prince ended his active career with Britain's armed services in 1976.
   Charles chose the Prince's Trust _ which he established in 1976
to help disadvantaged youths find jobs _ to organize his public
birthday celebration in Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city.
   Shebbeare, director of the Prince's Trust, said in an interview
published Sunday in the Observer newspaper that the prince had
decided not to give an interview himself because he didn't want to
get involved ``in the hype'' surrounding his birthday.
   ``He is now pretty determined that he has departed on an
interesting and useful role as the Prince of Wales, and that his
interventions into areas of public life are things that he can do
usefully for the nation,'' Shebbeare was quoted as saying.
   After years of being picked on by the tabloid press, which has
accused him of everything from eccentricity to failing as a husband,
Charles has recently been lauded as ``charismatic'' and ``a great
communicator.''
   The new media appraisal followed a 70-minute television attack on
modern architectural development _ including central Birmingham,
which Charles said had been turned into a monstrous concrete maze in
which only cars could find their way. ``People didn't stand a
chance,'' he said.
   The prince has been expressing his views with greater
determination on other issues as well: the creation of jobs and
businesses, the building of homes that people would like to live in,
the protection of the environment, and a united Europe where
individual countries retain their own languages and culture.
   But there are other sides to the 21st Prince of Wales.
   There's the action man who loves polo and skiing, who plummetted
into the ocean in a tangled parachute, and who skied clear of an
avalanche that killed one of his best friends.
   There's the father who played at the seaside in the Spanish
resort of Majorca with his sons, and who took them to their first
fox hunt on Saturday _ enraging animal rights activists.
   There's the husband whose relationship with his wife, Diana _
repeatedly named one of the most beautiful and best-dressed women in
the world _ is chronicled daily in the tabloid press, regardless of
any factual basis.
   Charles' birthday ball was to be attended by 300 guests,
including members of the royal family and King Olav of Norway.

<HEAD>New Beaujolais Takes Off to Worldwide Wine Lovers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forklifts laden with cases of new Beaujolais rushed
across the tarmac at Charles De Gaulle airport Monday to load the
wine onto cargo jets bound for bon vivants around the world.
   Under French law, Beaujolais ``primeur'' is not to be uncorked
until 12:01 a.m. Thursday and customs officials kept an eye on
loading operations to make sure not one drop was consumed before its
time.
   Pallets weighing four tons each were lifted through the open nose
of the Air France Boeing 747 bound for New York. About 72,000
bottles were on a 10 a.m. flight that was delayed two hours because
of a mechanics strike.
   Other cartons were destined for Portland, Ore., Phoenix, San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Ketchum, Idaho, and dozens of other American
cities.
   The U.S. market represents about 10 percent of all Beaujolais
sales. West Germany, Switzerland and Britain combined take about 60
percent of the new wine. The fastest growing market is Japan.
   A Japan Air Lines cargo plane was prepared for takeoff carrying
the pride of dozens of Beaujolais vinters, while workers rushed to
load a Korean Airlines jet parked between the JAL and Air France
planes.
   For their compatriots far from home, Air France flights were also
carrying wine to French overseas territories such as the island of
Reunion.
   ``A delay of a day or two is disastrous,'' according to Air
France spokesman Raymond Courtat, who said the airline would ship
330 tons of wine on Monday and a similar amount Tuesday. ``The most
difficult part is moving fast yet safely.''
   Trucks from the Beaujolais region began arriving about 4 a.m. at
the airport while other trucks carried wine to ports on the English
channel for shipment to England and still others hit the highway for
European points.
   Beaujolais vintners in central France will produce an estimated
7.9 million gallons of the simple, fruity and relatively inexpensive
wine.
   Unlike aged wines, primeur Beaujolais is ready for drinking about
six weeks after harvest and meant to be consumed in the months
immediately after its mid-November release. After that, it rapidly
loses its flavor.
   The early selling wine accounts for about 55 percent of the
Beaujolais crop this year, compared with about 6 percent two decades
ago.

   National and international flights were
canceled at airports in northern Italy because of a 12-hour strike
by air traffic controllers Monday, but Tuesday's scheduled
nationwide strike was called off.
   The strike forced the cancellation of flights to and from Milan,
Turin, Genoa, Venice and Pisa.
   ``Only flights to the Italian islands were unaffected by the
walkout,'' said a spokesman for Milan's Linate airport. ``All other
flights were canceled.''
   The unions called off Tuesday's scheduled 13-hour nationwide
strike after reaching an accord with management.
   The agreement calls for more flexible work schedules and
promotion of 500 controllers to a higher pay category.
   The controllers agreed to suspend any labor unrest through Jan.
16 pending final acceptance of the agreement by the two sides.

   A U.S. congressional delegation arrived Monday on a
visit to discuss human rights and security issues with Soviet
officials and see a prison camp.
   Rep. Donald Ritter, R-Pa., expressed concern about the Soviet
military buildup in Afghanistan, and said they could cast a ``dark
shadow'' over improving U.S.-Soviet relations, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said.
   The Soviet Union recently began introducing SS-1 Scud missiles
and sophisticated MiG-27 warplanes in Afghanistan, and have
suspended the withdrawal of their soldiers because of pressure by
anti-government Moslem rebels.
   The delegation of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, led by Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was invited to Moscow by
Soviet officials and met by Supreme Soviet deputy Mikhail Pichuzhkin.
   It was the first time all nine U.S. representatives and the
Senate leader of the group, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., were
invited to the Soviet Union. The commission reviews implementation
of the 1975 Helsinki act on European security and cooperation in
areas such as human rights.
   The delegation is scheduled to visit a Soviet prison camp on
Thursday, and also to meet with dissidents and Jews denied
permission to emigrate, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Mike Hurley.
   It was to hold a series of meeting with Soviet officials on human
rights, security, and regional differences, he said.
   The group sought a meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, but was unlikely to get it. Gorbachev was attending a
meeting on farm policy in the city of Orel, south of Moscow, and is
preparing for a trip to India later this week.
   Accompanying the legislators were three assistant Cabinet
secretaries _ Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for
human rights issues; Assistant Defense Secretary Ronald Lehman; and
Assistant Commerce Secretary Louis Laun.

   Police suspended three white

black man in custody.
   Oupie Mpete, 26, died Friday while in detention, one day after he
was arrested for a ``criminal offense'' in Reivilo in north-central
South Africa, said police Col. Vic Heyns.
   Heyns said Mpete was not held under the country's 29-month-old
state of emergency regulations, but declined to elaborate Mpete's
alleged offense.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods of time under the emergency, and five are known to
have died in custody.
   Heyns did not release the names of the suspended officers.
   Many detainees have alleged that they were victims of police
assault and torture. Some have filed lawsuits against the police,
and on several occasions police have paid have paid out-of-court
settlements.

actions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The court, without comment, refused to give husbands the legal
power to prevent their wives from having abortions. The justices let
stand an Indiana Supreme Court decision that a husband has no right
to interfere with his wife's constitutional right to abort her
pregnancy. The state court's ruling last July was based directly on
past rulings by the nation's highest court.
   The case is Conn vs. Conn, 88-347.

   The court denied an emergency request from deposed Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, that they not be
compelled to abide by a federal grand jury's request for financial
and other records related to an investigation of the couple. A
federal judge in New York ruled Aug. 11 that the Marcoses, who are
charged with looting their nation's treasury of more than $100
million, must honor the subpoenas and no longer have immunity as
ruler and first lady of a foreign country.
   The case is Marcos vs. U.S., A-361.

<HEAD>VOTING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The court let stand an appellate ruling that the federal Voting
Rights Act, designed to prevent racial discrimination, applies to
state judicial elections. Without comment, the justices rejected an
appeal by Louisiana officials who said the law is not intended to
cover the judicial branch and could impair the independent of judges.
   The case is Roemer vs. Chisom, 88-327.

   The court ruled that the state of Arkansas can hold a sentencing
trial for a man mistakenly sent to prison as a habitual offender. By
a 6-3 vote, the court said a second trial would not violate the
Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy clause, which protects a defendant
from undergoing trial more than once for any single offense.
   The case is Lockhart vs. Nelson, 87-1277.

   The court agreed to rule on the constitutionality of a
Connecticut law aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs
no more than it does in three neighboring states. The justices said
they will review a ruling that the 1984 law regulating beer prices
unduly interfered with interstate commerce. In 1983, the court voted
5-3 in striking down as unconstitutional a similar Connecticut law.
   The cases are Healy vs. Beer Institute, 88-449, and Wine and
Sprits Wholesalers vs. Beer Institute, 88-513.

   Leo Alexander Jones received a stay of
execution this morning an hour before he was to die in the electric
chair for the 1981 ambush slaying of a young police officer.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II in Jacksonville granted
Jones, 38, a hearing for Tuesday. The execution was rescheduled for
7:01 a.m. Wednesday.
   In Florida State Prison near Starke, Jones refused a last meal
this morning. Prison officials had not yet shaved his head or legs
where the electrodes were to be attached when news of the stay came
down at 11:10 a.m.
   ``This is unusual in my experience for a stay to be issued this
close to an execution,'' Bob Macmaster, a spokesman for the state
Department of Corrections. Jones was slated to die in the electric
chair at 12:01 p.m.
   Jones was condemned for the sniper slaying of Officer Thomas J.
Szafranski. The 28-year-old officer had gone to Jones' apartment
building to respond to a hostage situation and was shot in the head
while sitting in his squad car.
   Prosecutors said Jones had been arrested on a traffic violation a
week earlier and vowed to kill Szafranski.
   A total of 103 people have been put to death in the United States
since U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.
Nineteen men have been executed in Florida, two this year.

cash and crystal globes awarded by the National Geographic Society
on its 100th anniversary.
   Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to reach the summit of Mount
Everest, and Robert D. Ballard, the Navy scientist who discovered
the sunken remains of the Titanic, also were among the pioneers
selected for society's ``Centennial Awards,'' which will be
presented Thursday.
   Other winners:
   _Bradford Washburn and Barbara Washburn for cartography and
mountaineering. The Washburns spent seven years creating a precise,
large-scale map of the Grand Canyon. Barbara Washburn was the first
women to reach the summit of Mount McKinley, North America's highest
peak.
   _Frank C. Craighead Jr. and John J. Craighead, biology and
ecology. The Craigheads were pioneers in the use of satellites for
radio tracking of animals and are known especially for their
research on grizzly bears.
   _Harold E. Edgerton, who developed the method of using strobe
lights to freeze action in pictures, allowing for the photography of
hummingbirds and other extraordinarily fast creatures and objects.
He also pioneered the underwater camera and side-scan sonar for
ocean research.
   _Thayer Soule, lecturer. Soule has shared his knowledge of the
world and its peoples with film and lectures since 1947.
   _Mary D. Leakey and Richard E. Leakey, for their research into
the beginnings of mankind. The Leakeys, from a first breakthrough in
1959, have made a series of discoveries of bones of ancestors of
modern humans.
   _George F. Bass, underwater archeologist, for his work in
increasing the understanding of the ancient world through
exploration of shipwrecks.
   _Jane Goodall, for her pioneering research of chimpanzees in
Tanzania, the longest continuous field research ever conducted on a
wild animal.
   _Kenan D. Ballard for a lifetime of work unearthing and restoring
the ancient classical Greek city of Aphrodisias, in present Turkey.
   Glenn, now a Democratic senator from Ohio, was the first American
to orbit the earth. Hillary was honored both for his famed climb of
Everest and his subsequent work in creating schools, hospitals and a
national park in the region.
   ``One mark of great individuals is their ability to look byond
areas of expertise to see the larger picture _ to understand the
problems facing us all and to do something about them,'' said the
society's president, Gilbert M. Grosvenor.

<HEAD>Environmetalists Say Bush Now Must Fulfill Campaign Promises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The environmental community, backed by polls
showing Americans want cleaner air, water and soil, is looking to
George Bush to put presidential substance behind his pro-environment
campaign pledges.
   ``Proclaiming himself an environmentalist is not enough,'' says
Robert SanGeorge, the National Audubon Society's vice president for
public affairs. ``Now is the time for action. He's got a lot to
prove.''
   Bush, declaring that ``I am an environmentalist,'' set himself a
broad environmental agenda during the campaign, promising action
against global warming, air and ocean pollution, toxic waste and
loss of wetlands.
   ``If he specifically proposes to Congress half of what he's
promised in the campaign, he'll have a hell of an environmental
record,'' says Gaylord Nelson, counselor to the Wilderness Society.
   Bush's statements represented a repudiation of many of the
policies that kept the Reagan administration and the
environment-conservation lobby fighting for eight years. His
campaign ads about the filthy waters of Boston harbor put
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis on the defensive.
   Both candidates ran as environmentalists, elevating the issue to
a higher level than in previous presidential races as they played to
an increasingly popular cause.
   A Gallup poll released two days before Bush's election said 65
percent of the respondents _ Republicans and Democrats _ said
``proposing laws to increase protection of the environment'' should
be the next president's top priority.
   ``The reason Bush got so many votes was because he did eliminate
some of the skepticism about his earlier environmental stands,''
said Nancy Light of the Sierra Club.
   She and other environmentalists said in interviews last week with
The Associated Press that the skepticism came from Bush's role early
in the Reagan years directing the effort to scrap federal
regulations, including some sacred to the environmental movement.
   Bush worked to overcome this by strong, although mainly
generalized, statements in favor of a better environment.
   ``In many ways Bush set up the expectation he's going to be the
best environmental president since Teddy Roosevelt,'' said Rick Hind
of U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ``But his past leaves us
puzzled as to whether he will live up to this expectation.''
   ``He made a lot of promises and commitments,'' said Dan Becker of
Environmental Action. ``It would be cynical for him to turn his back
on them.''
   They and others say the nation won't have to wait until Bush
assumes office Jan. 20 to get a sense of his environmental direction.
   ``The clearest indications will be the appointments he makes to
the key environmental posts,'' said Brent Blackwelder of the
Environmental Policy Institute.
   These jobs are the secretaries of the interior and energy and the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``He needs to put in people who are not like the James Watt
wrecking crew,'' said David Baker of Friends of the Earth, referring
to President Reagan's first and highly controversial interior
secretary.
   Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund,
praised Bush's first Cabinet choice, James A. Baker III as secretary
of state. He said that as treasury secretary Baker was instrumental
in pushing international lending agencies to pay attention to the
environmental consequences of their Third World loans.
   Krupp sees the top job at the State Department as a post growing
in environmental importance because of worldwide problems such as
global warming. ``The greenhouse effect overrides all other
environmental problems. It is in a class with preventing nuclear
war.''
   Environmentalists ticked off a long list of items they say needs
leadership from the new administration: better toxic waste control;
protection of ground water; a strengthened Clean Air Act; a national
energy policy that puts conservation and safe, clean alternatives
ahead of petroleum and coal; cleaner oceans and rivers; better
management of public lands.
   Nelson, a former Democratic senator from Wisconsin, says what
Bush does about the environment could be the most important legacy
of his presidency.
   ``It could put him down in history as a great leader,'' Nelson
said.
   After its struggles with the Reagan administration, the
environmental community is taking a deep breath and looking ahead,
even if Bush wasn't the first choice of many of its leaders.
   After Ronald Reagan, said SanGeorge, ``it can't get any worse.''

   The co-directors of George Bush's transition
opened the president-elect's office today, saying their boss had no
firm timetable for making appointments but the team would move
expeditiously.
   The men, Craig Fuller and Robert Teeter, would not confirm
speculation that Bush would act this week to keep Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady in the job he has held since August. Brady, a
former chairman of Dillon, Read & Co., is a long-time friend of Bush.
   But Teeter, a top strategist in the presidential campaign, said
Bush's economics team ``is one that he would want to pay attention
to.'' Other speculation has centered on Richard Darman as the new
budget director.
   Since Bush's election last Tuesday, the dollar has fallen against
the Japanese yen and the German mark, causing jitters on Wall
Street. Bush, who is vacationing in Florida, sought to minimize the
situation today. ``These gyrations happen,'' Bush said.
   Fuller, chief of staff in the vice president's office, said he
and Teeter had spent ``a great deal of time'' talking with each
other over the weekend and had also consulted with Bush by telephone.
   ``We're delighted to be coming to work,'' he said at a briefing
for reporters on the sidewalk outside the transition office about 12
blocks from the White House.
   Bush has no timetable for making appointments in the 70-day
period before his inauguration, but he will name people as decisions
are made, Fuller said. Bush named former Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III the new secretary of state the day after Bush was elected.
   For major appointments, Fuller said Bush would be presented with
three to five names. The president-elect does not have to chose any
of the people on the list, however. Both Fuller and Teeter will
interview candidates.
   On his return to the nation's capital Tuedsay, Bush will meet
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Vice President-elect Dan Quayle
will sit in on the meeting, Fuller said. On Wednesday, Bush sees
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Besides the top jobs, the transition needs to hire people who
will work in the office until Jan. 20. Officials will also sift
through resumes from people hoping to be hired for the 5,000
political jobs that come open next year.

   A shipment of relief supplies put together
by a Mississippi church group for Jamaicans still recovering from
Hurricane Gilbert will include a classic Southern delicacy _ 40,000
pounds of red beans and rice.
   Also included in the $30,758 package is 5,000 pounds of dried
eggs, 5,000 pounds of powdered milk and 10,000 pounds of flour, said
Jerry Mitchell of Jackson, coordinator of a disaster relief program
for the Mississippi Conference of the United Methodist Church.
   ``Even though it's out of the newspapers, the people are still
suffering,'' Mitchell said.
   At least 26 people were killed in September when Hurricane
Gilbert swept over Jamaica and damaged most of the island's homes
and crops.
   An Air National Guard C141B transport will carry the food later
this week, Mitchell said. A shipment of building materials is
planned later this month.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said today it's ``nice to
be back at the Statehouse'' and too early to decide whether to seek
re-election in 1990.
   ``I'm back at a job I love. I'm challenged by it,'' Dukakis said
at his first news conference on state issues since he lost the race
for the White House. He promised to make a decision on his plans
sometime next year.
   During the news conference, Dukakis announced steps to address
the ``major challenges'' facing Massachusetts government, including
a budget deficit projected by House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Richard Voke at $282 million.
   The governor refused to rule out new taxes but promised to
balance the $11.6 billion budget when the fiscal year ends in June.
   ``We face major challenges,'' Dukakis acknowledged, but he
disagreed with critics who maintain the state faces a ``fiscal
crisis'' and denied that problems have worsened at home because of
his presidential campaign.
   Asked about his political future, Dukakis said he had made no
decision about whether to run for governor again in 1990. ``It's too
early to tell,'' he said.
   The governor spent the weekend getting his first rest in weeks.
``It's nice to be back at the Statehouse,'' he said after taking the
trolley to work. ``The Green Line was on time and working.''
   Dukakis said he was grateful to legislators for their ``patience
and cooperation'' during his 20-month presidential effort.
   Dukakis outlined the steps he is taking to control spending, four
months into the fiscal year. They include giving his finance
secretary veto power over most hiring, meeting with his Cabinet
secretaries to discuss savings targets, and getting tough on
spending in government accounts that traditionally run
``deficiencies.'' He singled out the huge Medicaid account.
   Despite the savings steps, Dukakis insisted tax collections are
only slightly below the monthly benchmarks set by the Revenue
Department.
   Asked about the need for new or higher taxes, Dukakis said: ``I
hope we can avoid them.'' Asked if he foresees layoffs, he said: ``I
would hope not.''

<HEAD>High Court To Decide Whether Investors May Sue Brokers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear
arguments on whether all investors' claims against brokers must be
settled by binding arbitration.
   Seventeen first-time investors brought the case to challenge
standard brokerage contracts that order arbitration to settle all
disputes. Unless the clauses can be enforced, investors could sue
their brokers in court.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the arbitration
language, a decision that reversed a lower federal court in
Brownsville, Texas. The lower court said some of the claims could
not be arbitrated.
   The investors, some of whom could not understand English,
included minors, widows and people dying of cancer.
   They opened securities accounts in 1982 and 1983 with the
Shearson Lehman Hutton office in Brownsville, doing business with
account manager Jon Grady Deaton.
   The investors claimed Deaton mismanaged separate accounts
totaling some $190,000, and conducted unauthorized transactions to
generate commissions and profits.
   Shearson filed a motion in federal court to enforce the
arbitration agreements in the contracts. But the district court
cited a 1953 case in which the Supreme Court ruled an agreement to
arbitrate certain claims was unenforceable under a 1933 securities
law.
   The company appealed, on ground that in a 1987 case, the high
court ruled that claims against brokers could be arbitrated in a
1934 law. The appellate court agreed with Shearson.
   The investors then appealed to the Supreme Court. Shearson agreed
that the high court should hear the case to clear up conflicts among
appellate courts on the issue.
   The case is de Quijas, Ofelia R., et al vs. Shearson American
Express, 88-385.

   Prince Charles donned a ``Life Begins
at 40'' button and poked fun at his eccentric image Monday as he
celebrated his birthday with 1,500 youths he has helped overcome
poverty and unemployment.
   ``You've given me one of the best birthday parties I could ever
have hoped for,'' the heir to the throne declared after a day that
included champagne toasts, birthday cakes, renditions of ``Happy
Birthday,'' and a princely bit of disco dancing with three of his
guests.
   A ball at Buckingham Palace for friends and family was scheduled
for the evening.
   Charles used his 40th birthday to launch an appeal for $70
million for the Prince's Youth Business Trust, a charity that gives
seed money and professional advice to unemployed people aged 18 to
25 who want to start their own business.
   He chose Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city, and spent the
day visiting projects partly financed by his various charities.
   He went to Handsworth, an inner city district torn by race riots
in 1985, to inspect Grove Lane Baths, which is being converted into
a community center.
   Then he continued to the Old Tram Depot, which has been made into
a transport museum. It was festooned with flags, balloons and
antique gaslamps. An old double-decker bus bore the number 40 and
the words ``Happy Birthday Prince Charles.''
   In the cavernous tram depot, the prince was serenaded by calypso
and rock bands, and by hundreds of young people singing a specially
composed paean to Charles: ``Thank you for showing where the road
can lead; If we put our mind to it, in time we will succeed.''
   His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is in good health at 62, and he
expects a long wait before being crowned King Charles III.
Meanwhile, his search for a meaningful role has transformed him into
a compelling spokesman for Britain's needy youth, and a critic of
environmental neglect.
   He also has a penchant for alternative medicine, vegetarianism,
talking to his plants and sojourning among the Bushmen of the
Kalahari Desert. He regards this simply as a measure of his
open-mindedness, and is known to be angry at the way some newspapers
here have exploited his foibles to question his sanity.
   His speech in Birmingham was a carefully crafted riposte,
frequently interrupted by laughter and cheers.
   ``Only the other day I was inquiring of an entire bed of
old-fashioned roses who were forced to listen to my dementing
ramblings on the meaning of the universe as I sat cross-legged in
the lotus position on the gravel path in front of me,'' he said.
   ``And I was inquiring of them what they thought would happen on
my birthday in a Birmingham tram shed. `A tram shed?' they all
replied, totally aghast at the thought. Yes, I said, a tram shed.
   ``At this point a row of prize Welsh leeks, cocky little things,
which were lurking in a nearby vegetable patch, chipped in to say
that they expected the shed would be filled with groups of
semi-naked Kalahari Bushmen ... and also a troupe or two of Tibetan
Buddhist monks ... armed with advance copies of the tabloid
newspapers which would be strewn in my path in a form of ancient
Buddhist greeting ...
   ``But looking around here, ladies and gentlemen, I see those
idiotic plants have got it wrong again. I knew they would. Instead,
you've given me one of the best birthday parties I could ever have
hoped for.''
   Gesturing to his lapel button, which he said was given to him by
his two small sons, he said, ``I'm not sure I ought to be reminded
of it, but my children reminded me of it just this day.''
   Of the charities he runs, he said: ``I never imagined for one
minute that they would become big enough to start giving expensive
birthday parties like this one. But it's all, I can assure you,
extremely rewarding and encouraging if you can see just one person's
life transformed by this means.''

news agency reported Monday.
   Vejvoda, who published about 70 songs during his lifetime, died
Sunday at his home near Prague.
   The song, sometimes known as ``Roll Out the Barrel'' was a
favorite among soldiers in World War II, including Gen. Dwight
Eisenhower.
   The tune, written in 1927 for Vejvoda's own band, was known in
Czech as ``Skoda Lasky'' or ``Love in Vain.''It also was popular in
German-speaking countries under the title ``Rosamunde.''
   Vejvoda lived in the town of Zabraslav, about six miles west of
Prague.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, welcoming Andrei D. Sakharov
at the White House, said today human rights will remain an irritant
in U.S.-Soviet relations until all political prisoners are released.
   ``We've had great success,'' Reagan said as he praised Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as more cooperative than any Kremlin
leader before him.
   But, Reagan said, ``We can only wait and see'' if Gorbachev makes
good on a promise to release all political prisoners.
   Sakharov told the president as they posed for pictures that
``there are only individuals'' left in jails. The Nobel laureate and
human rights activist spoke through an American interpreter.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that during their
meeting, Sakharov ``was very thankful'' to Reagan ``for what he had
done on behalf of human rights and for him and his wife.''
   Sakharov, however, also voiced concern about the impact that
Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missile defense program would have on efforts
by the superpowers to negotiate a cut in long-range nuclear missile
stockpiles.
   These statements led Reagan to talk about the ``insurance
policy'' concept behind development of the Strategic Defense
Initiative, according to Fitzwater, who also said that the president
told Sakharov that while there is a treaty to ban chemical weapons,
``we still keep our gas masks.''
   Sakharov says the West should worry more about the possibility
that Gorbachev will fail in his bid to transform Soviet society, and
less about whether the changes will strengthen the communist nation.
   Sakharov, the Soviet Nobel Peace Prize-winning physicist and
longtime spokesman for political prisoners and dissidents, told
those honoring him Sunday at a National Academy of Sciences banquet
that the effects of perestroika _ the ambitious economic
restructuring pursued by Gorbachev _ will ripple throughout the
world.
   He said some have suggested that the Soviet Union could pose an
even greater threat to the West if the Soviet economy is
strengthened.
   ``I always answer that question this way,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``The threat (to the West) of perestroika doesn't
consist of its success, but of its bloody failure. This would be a
total calamity.''
   The program pushed by Gorbachev, the Soviet general secretary,
includes greater freedoms and movement away from a centrally
controlled economy.
   ``I believe we are undergoing historic events whose significance
extends beyond our country to the whole world,'' said Sakharov.
   Sakharov, 67, was sent to internal exile in the Soviet city of
Gorky in 1980 after criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and the immigration policies of his country. Gorbachev freed him two
years ago.
   Sakharov first made his mark as a physicist whose original
concepts in subatomic particles attracted world attention among
scientists. He is considered the father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
   Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, told
the banquet guests that Sakharov was inducted into the American
academy in 1973 as an associate member. But unlike other members,
Sakharov had never been allowed to come to the United States to sign
the membership book.
   While guests applauded, the Soviet scientist strolled to the
large, red-bound ledger and signed his name.
   Sakharov said that during his long years of exile, the American
academy members ``supported me unequivocally.''
   ``This is a fact I can never let myself forget,'' he said.
   The 100 guests who attended the banquet included other Soviet
scientists, noted American physicists, physicians, arms control
negotiators, human rights advocates and government officials.
   Sakharov is in Washington to attend the first meeting of the
International Foundation for the Survival and Development of
Humanity. The foundation was organized by U.S. and Soviet scientists
to address social and scientific problems that affect mankind.

<HEAD>More Jobs Opened to Women in Military Following Discrimination
Review</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year-long review of the military's treatment
of its female personnel ended Monday with the Army announcing it was
opening 11,138 new jobs to women, Pentagon officials said.
   The decision, when combined with previous moves by the Navy, Air
Force and Marine Corps, brings to more than 24,000 the number of
previously closed positions opened to women since the review began
in October 1987.
   ``I think the overall message is that the secretary (of defense)
is firmly committed to opening all positions to women that are
compatible with existing laws and statutues,'' said Dr. David J.
Armor, the principal deputy assistant secretary for manpower.
   Armor said the decision indicates the Pentagon's commitment to
``maximize (women's) opportunities in the military.''
   Currently, women comprise 10.4 percent of the U.S. armed forces,
or about 217,400 enlisted personnel and officers of the 2.1 million
total.
   Armor declined to predict whether opening additional positions to
women might attract more female recruits. ``In the Army, for
example, we have 50 percent of the Army positions open to women. But
I don't think we'll ever have 50 percent of those positions filled
by women because it requires the people to volunteer.''
   Armor appeared at a Pentagon briefing to announce completion of
the work of the DoD Task Force on Women in the Military, a panel
formed in October 1987 after another advisory committee reported
strong evidence of sexual harassment and abuse in the Navy and
Marine Corps.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in reviewing task force
findings last January, ordered a new educational effort to attack
sexual harassment. He also ordered all four services to adopt the
same ``risk analysis'' rule for determining if particular jobs
should be closed to women.
   The task force found that while roughly 50 percent of military
personnel were assigned to combat positions _ which by law must be
filled by men _ and roughly 50 percent were in non-combat support
jobs, there were thousands of jobs in the middle that required
judgment calls that frequently went against women.
   ``Each of the services had a way of designating positions,''
Armor said. ``That led to situations where a reconnaissance aircraft
in the Navy was closed but it was open in the Air Force. So what
we've really done here is adopted the same value in evaluating
risk.''
   The new rule specifies that a particular job or military
occupation should be judged not on the basis of the skills involved
or the unit to which it is now assigned, but on whether the position
would expose an individual to the same risk of hostile fire as a
combat job.
   Applying that standard, the Navy previously had opened new jobs
to women aboard logistic support ships; the Air Force had opened
positions in its Red Horse civil engineering units and surveillance
aircraft like the TR-1 and U-2 spy planes; and the Marine Corps had
opened slots within its embassy guard force and base security forces.
   The Army positions opened on Monday include jobs within a
specialty that involves constructing electrical power systems to
support rear headquarter units; some additional jobs in the Engineer
Combat Support Equipment Companies; and many new positions within
the headquarters staff of combat units.
   Such headquarters operations would be set up well behind the line
of fighting where the risk of combat exposure is not that great, the
Army decided.

   Prime time television is coming to the nation's

departed ``Spenser: For Hire'' program.
   The action-drama show, starring Avery Brooks, is the first series
ever filmed in and around Washington, D.C. It will be aired by ABC
at an undetermined time.
   Fans of ``Spenser: For Hire'' know Hawk as a mysterious,
physically intimidating black man to whom Spenser, played by Robert
Urich, often turned for advice.
   Bald and deadly serious, with opaque sunglasses, long leather
coat, baritone voice and huge revolver, the Hawk character emanated
an air of supreme confidence that earned him a growing following on
the ``Spenser'' show.
   In the new series, Hawk comes home to Washington, where he will
be drawn into an adventure each week.

   Doctors are attacking heart disease with a
variety of tiny new devices that shave, sand or burn away fatty
deposits that clog the arteries, according to reports Monday.
   ``This is in its infancy,'' said Dr. George Beller of the
University of Virginia. ``Progress is being made by leaps and
bounds. We are starting to see the first trials in patients.''
   All of the gadgets being developed are intended to burrow through
plugged heart arteries and blast away the fatty buildups that choke
off the flow of blood and cause heart attacks.
   They were described Monday at the annual meeting of the American
Heart Association. An estimated 30,000 people are attending the
four-day meeting.
   All of the devices are intended to replace or improve balloon
angioplasty. This treatment, performed on 184,000 people last year,
is one of the nation's most common medical procedures.
   During angioplasty, doctors thread a tiny balloon through an
artery into the heart. There it's inflated, squeezing open the
narrowed blood vessel. However, in about 30 percent of cases the
vessel soon closes shut again.
   Doctors hope the new tools will solve this problem. The devices
have been tested on numbers ranging from about 50 to more than 200
patients. While these initial results show they can open up clogged
arteries, more followup will be necessary before doctors know
whether the long-term success is any better than with balloon
angioplasty.
   The new devices include:
   _Shaver catheter. This device works something like a miniature
electric razor. Anything on the vessel walls that contacts the
catheter's whirling blades is sliced off and removed.
   _Rotablator. This is a diamond-coated burr similar to a dentist's
drill. ``It literally polishes and sands the inside of a diseased
vessel,'' said Dr. Robert Ginsburg of Stanford University.
   _Hot-tipped laser. This metal point is heated by a laser. It
burns away the fatty deposits.
   _Smart laser. This approach uses a laser beam directly to burn
the deposits. Earlier attempts failed because the pin-point beam
burned holes in the artery. Now doctors are marking the fat first
with specific colors, then using lasers that only attack those
colors.
   _Laser and balloon. In this technique, doctors open up the artery
with a balloon. Then they use relatively low levels of laser heat to
seal off tears in the vessel wall and, they hope, prevent it from
squeezing shut again.
   In addition, several reports at the meeting describe the use of
mesh tubes that are pushed into the newly opened blood vessels. The
goal is to hold the blood vessels open after angioplasty.
   Of the devices described, the shaver catheter has been tested
most widely, used on about 230 heart patients at several hospitals.
   Its developer, Dr. John B. Simpson of Sequoia Hospital in Redwood
City, Calif., predicted that it will be approved for widespread use
in about a year. Doctors working with other devices said as much as
five years more testing may be required before they can be employed
routinely.
   Several experts said they doubt the devices will replace the need
for coronary bypass surgery, a common technique in which blood is
detoured around plugged arteries.

<DATELINE>ISLE AU HAUT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 45 year-round residents of this
rockbound island are putting their highly prized privacy on the line
and allowing telephones in their homes in an effort to guarantee
their future.
   ``The survival of the community's at stake here,'' said Belvia
MacDonald, who led efforts to bring phones to the island but won't
get one herself. ``I like the quietness, and they're going to put in
a phone booth I can use.''
   MacDonald, who has lived with her lobsterman husband on the
rugged island for more than three decades, said Isle au Haut needs
new residents to keep businesses viable and the post office and
one-room schoolhouse open.
   Telephones could be an incentive for people considering living on
Isle au Haut, one of about 2,000 islands along Maine's jagged coast
and perhaps the last New England town without service.
   While there have been only minor fluctuations in the island's
population, residents are getting concerned about an impending loss
as the core of year-round residents ages. A few older people already
have moved off the island over the last couple of years to be closer
to medical facilities.
   Rocky and guarded at one end by 500-foot cliffs, Isle au Haut's
residents are proud of their spirit of self-reliance, required for
the sometimes harsh environment and isolation.
   ``People out here enjoy this remote living, without the worries
and hassles of a more normal environment,'' said Louis ``Bud''
Blaisdell, a town selectman.
   While some do not relish the arrival of phones, they prefer that
intrusion to the prospect of losing their way of life.
   Crime is unheard of. Virtually every adult pitches in with some
civic service, such as volunteer firefighter or town selectman. In
summer, practically everyone, from the youngest child to elderly
folks, join in evening softball games.
   ``Any problem of any sort, people will cooperate and help.
They're very sensitive to others' problems,'' Blaisdell said. ``It's
like a large family.''
   Electrical service was introduced only 18 years ago to the
fishing community, also as a hedge against population loss. The
islanders' power cooperative hooked up to the mainland grid by an
undersea cable in 1982.
   To a visitor, the utility poles running and a car or pickup truck
that occasionally rolls by are the only clues that the 20th century
has arrived on the six- by three-mile Isle au Haut, French for high
island.
   It may be the last town in Maine, and possibly New England, to be
without telephone service, said Bill Black of the Maine Public
Advocate's Office, which was involved in efforts to bring phone
service to the island.
   Efforts began two years ago, when a ``telephone committee'' found
that 88 percent of the residents wanted the service. Initial efforts
to find a supplier failed. Companies said the project would be too
expensive. But in June, Jeffrey V. Webber, founder and president of
the tiny Island Telephone Co., came forward.
   Webber set up a similar service a few years ago for the Maine
island of Frenchboro, and can provide it to Isle au Haut for an
estimated $180,000.
   The microwave towers are to be erected this week.
   Sixteen homes have been connected to phone lines and can
communicate among themselves, and Webber said full service off the
island should be in place by Thanksgiving. ``If they don't get it
with their turkey, they'll get a bow on it'' this Christmas, he said.
   ``I'm pretty much against the phones, though we're going to get
one,'' said Lori Jablon, a teacher's aide. ``You can't pretend they
don't exist.''
   The island's more than 300 summer residents are likewise split,
but have supported community efforts to provide service.
   Blaisdell, a retired engineer who made due for years without
running water, welcomes the new technology. To call his son in
Florida, he now must drive to the dock and board the mailboat for a
40-minute ride to the island of Stonington to the nearest pay phone.
   Tina Tully, one of the first islanders to get a phone, described
her first call as ``wonderful.''
   Her federally licensed radio phone has been the island's only
dependable telecommunications link with the world, but she said her
neighbors have always respected her family's privacy and seldom
asked to use it.
   Citizen's band radios, used sometimes in the past, are impersonal
and their signals are often drowned out by static, residents say.
   None of the islanders interviewed could recall a situation in
which a phone would have made the difference between life or death.
And no one knows how life will change when the full system is up,
but so far, Tully said, ``It hasn't done anything but make life
easier.''

   Gerrie Schipske didn't win a seat on
the City Council, but her post-election cleanup could be a sign she
has a bright future as an environmental activist.
   Ms. Schipske, anxious to clear the community of her campaign
signs after last week's election, ran a newspaper ad offering $1 for
each sign returned.
   Unfortunately, she neglected to say in the ad that she only
wanted her campaign signs, not everybody else's.
   On Sunday, as she waited at a park to collect her own signs,
people showed up with signs from Assembly, Senate, congressional and
presidential contests as well as from elections in the cities of
Cypress, Garden Grove and Huntington Beach. There were even signs
promoting the campaign of Les Robbins, who had defeated Ms. Schipske.
   ``I kept telling them, `Why should I pay for someone else's
signs?''' she said.
   But she paid $50 for her own signs and promised to send checks to
15 families that brought only signs she didn't want.
   And afterward she hauled all the signs away.

   In one corner, dozens of Sudanese
Dervishes stand ready to defend Khartoum against British cavalry.
Nearby are Abyssinian tribesmen, poised to fight off Mussolini's
invasion.
   And just around the corner, Zulu warriors armed with shields and
spears fight Boer settlers for the plains of South Africa.
   All in New Jersey, where about 1,000 collectors of military
miniatures gathered Sunday to trade, sell or admire detailed
replicas of armies and weaponry.
   ``There seems to be less interest this year in mainstream armies,
like the British and French,'' mused Tom Fallon, a clinical
psychologist from Boston who paints the intricate uniforms on the
tiny armies he sells during weekends. ``I'd say the English Civil
War and the Boer War are the most popular this year.''
   Fallon's wares included a regiment of Imperial Chinese troops
from the Boxer Rebellion of the 1890s and Belgian soldiers from
World War I.
   ``In many ways the more obscure the conflict, the greater the
value to the collector,'' he said. ``But we, that is collectors, are
not militarists. We do this so that we can remember the mistakes of
the past, so that we do not repeat them.''
   Bill Lango, a collector and vendor from North Bergen, said he
began collecting miniatures in 1965.
   ``I wanted to get the toys I had as a kid back from my parents,
but we moved around a lot and they threw the stuff out along the
way,'' he said. ``So my wife and I started going to antique shops on
the weekends and it kind of became a habit.''
   But it's peaceful habit, he said. ``We think of ourselves more
like people who trade baseball cards than warlike.''
   Collecting soldiers, according to Vincent Vernon of Bardstown,
Ky., can be traced to ancient Egypt. Louis XIV had an army of toy
soldiers as a child, and Napoleon used toy soldiers to plan
conquests.

   Border guards fought a gun battle with
Colombian bandits who planned to kidnap a rancher and captured three
of them, a national guard officer said Monday.
   The Saturday shootout near the town of Casigua, about 300 miles
west of Caracas, stopped the Colombians from kidnapping the rancher,
Nolberto Guttierez, said Gen. Vinicio Barrios Puche.
   Three revolvers and jungle boots were seized along with the men,
he said.
   Some of the retreating bandits may have been injured, since
bloodstains were found, he said, adding that no soldiers were
wounded.
   Security forces increased border patrols after the number of
clashes between Venezuelan troops and alleged Colombian guerrillas
rose recently.
   Last month, security forces killed 14 Colombian fishermen, who
authorities say were guerrillas.
   Barrios did not say if the kidnappers were considered guerrillas.

   Police today found a sixth corpse
buried in the yard of a tree-shaded Victorian rooming house whose
landlady is suspected of killing the elderly boarders for their
Social Security checks.
   Investigators believe seven or eight bodies may have been buried,
based on the number of residents missing, said Homicide Lt. Joe
Enloe.
   Detectives sought Dorothea Montalvo Puente, 59, for investigation
of murder, Enloe said. The landlady was interviewed Friday by police
after the first body was discovered but was released for lack of
evidence.
   The woman apparently had been regularly cashing some of the
victims' Social Security checks for several months, he said.
   Sgt. Bob Burns said the sixth corpse was found under a metal
shed, wrapped in clothing. Police used picks and shovels today and
will use a backhoe to dig up the rest of the yard, Burns said.
   Puente was convicted in 1982 of grand theft and imprisoned for
drugging three elderly people and taking their possessions after
meeting them in bars, police said. She served 2{ years of a
five-year sentence before being paroled, officials said.
   The boardinghouse is not a nursing home and did not require a
license.
   The first body was discovered Friday and was followed by the
unearthing of two more bodies Saturday and two others Sunday.
   After uncovering the fifth body, police arrested John McCauley,
59, on suspicion of being an accessory to the homicides. McCauley, a
resident at the boardinghouse, was arrested after he gave
conflicting information, Enloe said.
   ``We do not believe that this could have been done solely by
herself,'' Enloe said. ``We know she's had people help her dig the
holes.''
   Police were unable to determine the identities of the victims or
how they died because four of the bodies were wrapped in cloth or
plastic, investigators said. They were able to determine the sex of
only the first body, ``wrapped like a mummy'' and described as a
gray-haired woman.
   The bodies, all found in the fetal position, showed no signs of
trauma, according to police, who said autopies would be performed.
   Enloe said evidence was discovered in the graves linking Puente
to the deaths, but he declined to elaborate.
   ``Part of the reason we have probable cause (for her arrest) is
because we've been digging for two days, and we've discovered
things,'' he said.
   An all-points bulletin was issued for Puente and she remained at
large today. She had not been charged, but Enloe said an arrest
warrant was being prepared for her for investigation of murder.
   Investigators also were seeking access to her bank records.
   ``Until we get a search warrant, until we get in her bank
account, find out what's in there, identify who these people are and
try to show she changed their money, it's still guesswork,'' Enloe
said.
   On Saturday, investigators cordoned off the two-story home and
yard in the city's northeast section, about one mile from the state
Capitol, and used picks, shovels and an earthmover to excavate the
yard.
   For months, neighbors had complained of a stench coming from the
site and were told a fish emulsion had been used there as a
fertilizer, police said.
   ``The first time was about the middle of last May,'' said
neighbor Will McIntire. ``We couldn't stand it. It definitely was
something dead. It had a sweet, sickly smell.''
   Neighbors said Puente often shouted at passers-by to stay off her
lawn.
   ``If somebody walked on her lawn, she'd cuss at them in language
that would make a sailor blush,'' McIntire said.
   Police went to the house last Monday after neighbors reported
former tenant Bert Montoya had been missing since August. Puente
told investigators Montoya had moved back to his home in Mexico,
officials said.
   Puente was very cooperative with police, Enloe said.
   ``We came over and asked her if we could dig in her yard,'' he
said. ``We said, `You don't have to let us dig in (your) yard.' She
said, `Dig in the yard, I don't know what's out there.'''

   Portraying the piano-pounding Jerry Lee
Lewis takes a lot of spontaneity, says Dennis Quaid, star of ``Great

   ``To be spontaneous, you've got to be willing to fall flat on

you're always on the edge of your seat watching him. You're just

   ``Great Balls Of Fire,'' which covers Lewis' life from 1956-58,

   Quaid said he had planned to sing in the film, but no one told
Lewis, who also planned to do the singing.
   ``Before we really knew each other, we had a conversation in a
packed dressing room. When he saw me, he said: `Son, you can't sing

   ``Now I don't really operate this way but I had to, so I said:
`Well, for that matter, you can't act like Dennis Quaid, either.'
And we spent five hours talking it over.''

<HEAD>Critics Say Surrogacy Case Shows Third World Mother Used as Breeder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATIONAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four mornings a week, without a word
or glance, Mario Haro and Alejandra Arellano Munoz exchange a
2{-year-old girl who has become a symbol in the controversy over
surrogate motherhood.
   Critics point to their case as an example of how Third World
mothers can be exploited as breeders for people from affluent
countries.
   Ms. Arellano Munoz, 22, a single mother of three from a small
town near Mazatlan, Mexico, and Haro's wife, Nattie, are cousins.
When the Haros couldn't conceive a child they brought her cousin
from Mexico to help them.
   Arellano Munoz, impregnated artificially with Haro's sperm, says
she believed she would carry the embryo just three weeks and then it
would be transplanted to Mrs. Haro.
   When she found out otherwise, she vowed to keep the child, Lydia
Michelle. A handwritten surrogacy contract paying $1,500 _ far below
the market $10,000 surrogacy payment _ was discredited. A judge
awarded joint custody.
   `It's only a matter of time before we start crossing more borders
and start hiring Third World breeders for families in this
country,'' said Matt Pawa, legislative liaison for the National
Coalition Against Surrogacy, a Washington-based advocacy group that
has followed the case.
   The Haros, also born in Mexico, live in a four-bedroom house in
Chula Vista. He is a 35-year-old teacher; she is a former bank
employee.
   ``I think their (the Haros') position has been that they have
more money, they're more educated, and therefore they have better
parenting skills,'' said lawyer Harvey E. Berman, who represented
Arellano Munoz in court last year. ``Fortunately, we don't rate
parents' abilities by how much money they have.''
   Arellano Munoz, a former cleaning woman, has a third-grade
education. She supports her two other children with $50 a month from
the Haros and charitable gifts. She shares an apartment here with
several other women.
   Another court hearing is scheduled after Lydia's third birthday
in July to determine her immediate future.
   ``I think she (Lydia) needs to be in a stable home, not bounding
around,'' said Mrs. Haro, 38, who has a 20-year-old daughter from a
previous marriage. ``I wish that she would just give us custody. ...
She has two other children to keep her occupied.''
   Arellano Munoz declined to be interviewed. In an interview last
year, she complained: ``I am ignored as ... the mother.''
   ``They would like her to disappear,'' said Gena Corea, a Boston
author and critic of surrogate motherhood. ``She was supposed to be
a breeder, a package that would just deliver this baby and
disappear. So it's really inconvenient that there's this human being
here.''

   An animal rights activist accused of
planting a bomb in an attempt to kill the head of a surgical
instruments company may have been supplied with the explosive device
by a terrorist group, a newspaper reported.
   The activist, Fran Stephanie Trutt, 33, of New York City, was
arraigned in Superior Court today on charges of attempted murder,
possession of explosives and manufacturing a bomb. She was being
held on $500,000 bail.
   Trutt did not enter enter a plea or speak during the appearance
and was scheduled for another hearing Nov. 29. Judge Edward Leavitt
refused to lower bail.
   Trutt was arrested Friday and accused of hiding a powerful,
radio-controlled pipe bomb packed with roofing nails in bushes at
the headquarters of U.S. Surgical Corp., near the vacant parking
space of chairman Leon Hirsch.
   The Sunday Advocate of Stamford quoted an unidentified source as
saying that police and the FBI are convinced that Ms. Trutt could
not have made the sophisticated bomb herself and that they believe a
terrorist group supplied the device.
   Three more bombs were discovered in Trutt's apartment after her
arrest.
   ``They're not nuclear weapons,'' a source told the newspaper.
``But the bombs are unique for their electronics.''
   The New York City police department's terrorist task force has
joined the FBI in the investigation into the manufacture of the
bombs, said spokeswoman Sgt. Diane Kubler.
   Assistant State's Attorney Harry Katz had no comment today on the
published reports.
   Animal rights activists have disavowed Trutt, saying that she is
not a member of their groups.
   The Norwalk company manufactures surgical staplers, which close
incisions without stitches, and demonstrates the devices on
anesthetized dogs.
   Trutt had a remote-control device in her hands that was to be
used to detonate the foot-long pipe bomb when she was arrested,
police said. About 200 people were working in the plant overnight at
the time.
   The three nail-wrapped bombs found in Trutt's basement apartment
were fashioned from plumbing pipes and ``certainly would have
destroyed the entire building'' and damaged surrounding houses, said
police Deputy Inspector Vincent Tarone.
   The New York-based Fund for Animals filed a complaint over the
experiments with the state Department of Health Services, which
rejected the complaint last month.
   Trutt's parents, Mary and Harry Trutt of New Hyde Park, N.Y.,
said their daughter told them in a telephone call from the jail
Saturday that she was set up by friends, who then tipped police.
   In an interview with Newsday, the Trutts said their daughter, who
graduated from Adelphi University and has a teaching certificate,
had no mechanical schooling and couldn't possibly have assembled the
bombs.
   She cared deeply about animals, often picking up strays and
nursing them back to health, the Trutts said. ``She would never,
never, under any circumstance, hurt anyone, or do anything to harm
anybody,'' Mrs. Trutt said.

   Lilacs in November? Thanks to this
year's drought, the purple, sweet-smelling flowers are blooming now.
   ``I was really shocked when we were out walking and saw them,''
said Barb Anderson of Grand Island. ``We thought we were seeing
things.''
   Lilacs can bloom in the fall ``in years with very hot, high
temperatures and some moisture stress,'' said Don Steinegger,
University of Nebraska extension horticulture specialist. ``It
doesn't happen on a regular basis but it does happen.''
   Lilacs, apples, cherries, peaches and pears, all can flower in
the fall. Plants that usually flower in the spring form their buds
in late summer, and the buds stay dormant over the winter,
Steinegger said. But heat and dryness during development can bring a
bloom on early, he said.

<HEAD>Questions Raised About Botha Link To Anti-Communist War Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition parties Monday
demanded an inquiry into why state television helped finance an
anti-communist war film for which President P.W. Botha's daughter
was production coordinator.
   The film ``Back To Freedom'' opened in South Africa last week and
has been panned by critics as an amateurish propaganda exercise.
   The far-right Conservative Party called for a commission to
investigate the South African Broadcasting Corp.'s involvement in
the production.
   Parliament member Dave Dalling, media spokesman for the liberal
Progressive Federal Party, said the film company involved was owned
by a friend of President Botha. Dalling asked who authorized the
corporation to provide more than $1 million to finance the film.
   Botha's daughter, Rozanne, coordinated production of the film,
but in the credits her last name is given as ``Both'' instead of
Botha. The film's scriptwriter, a university professor, also used a
pseudonym.
   Public controversy was sparked by reports in Sunday newspapers
that Alvyn Schlebusch, the Cabinet minister formerly in charge of
the corporation, had recommended that the final $200,000 installment
of its payment to Mimosa Films be withheld because the film was
substandard.
   According to the reports, President Botha overruled Schlebusch
and ordered the payment.
   Schlebusch subsequently resigned. His successor, Stoffel van der
Merve, said the broadcasting company's involvement in the film was
legitimate.
   In return for its financing, the corporation was to get all
domestic box office profits and half of overseas profits.
   The movie plot is based loosely on the civil war in Angola, where
South African-backed rebels are fighting the Soviet- and
Cuban-supported troops of Angola's Marxist government.
   South African military equipment was used in the film and dozens
of soldiers reportedly served as extras. The Sunday Times newspaper
said it was believed the script was submitted to Angolan rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi for approval.

   The three victims of a sewerage tunnel explosion
lived a short time before succumbing to burns and carbon monoxide
poisoning, a medical examiner's investigator said Monday.
   ``They might have been unconscious,'' said Richard Goeb, who
could not say exactly how long the men lived.
   Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann said the
cause of Thursday's explosion may never be known, but his office was
investigating to ensure that all possible safety precautions are
taken in tunnel work.
   ``There's no question it is dangerous,'' McCann said. ``Can
anything be done? We hope it can.''
   McCann said it may still be another week before investigators can
enter the tunnel. High levels of methane gas have kept it closed
since the bodies were removed.
   The victims were identified as Ron Kohne, 49, a shift
superintendent from Big Sandy, Tenn.; Tony Bell, 25, a shift foreman
from Sturgeon Bay; and Rick Sochacki, 34, a safety officer from
South Holland, Ill. All were employees of the S.A. Healy Co. of
McCook, Ill., and were checking methane levels when the explosion
occurred.
   It took eight hours for rescuers to reach the victims and remove
their bodies from 2,000 feet inside the tunnel, part of a project
for the Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewerage District.
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators were
interviewing Healy workers and officials and fire department
personnel who took part in the rescue, Gerald Cunningham, spokesman
for OSHA, said Monday.
   Cunningham said OSHA investigators were hoping to determine
whether an OSHA regulation to provide a safe and healthful workplace
and safe and healthful environment had been violated.
   Cunningham said Healy, which in March was cited by OSHA for
violations including inadequate ventilation of a shaft leading to a
tunnel, had been ``most cooperative'' in the investigation.
   Company officials did not immediately return calls seeking
comment.
   Six people, including those on Thursday, have died on the
Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewerage District project.

   Iran has urged the Soviet Union to resume
joint ventures halted by the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Monday.
   Mohammad Iravani, Iran's economic and financial affairs minister,
made the request to Oleg Bortyevmev, deputy chairman of the Soviet
construction committee, during his visit to Tehran.
   Iravani asked the Soviets to complete a project that would boost
output at the Isfahan steel plant, as well as transportation
projects and dams on the Aras, Atrak and Harirud rivers, according
to the agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   Bortyevmev said his government wants to build factories in Iran
for making construction materials.
   Iran and the Soviet Union also plan to operate a shipping line in
the Caspian Sea, and Iran has agreed to buy two freighters from the
Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union pulled hundreds of technicians from Iran after
Iraqi air raids in 1985. A cease-fire in the war took effect Aug. 20.

<HEAD>Moslem Leader Begins Reign in Nigeria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new leader of Nigeria's Moslems was
installed under heavy security Monday, one week after rioting over
his appointment led to the deaths of 10 people.
   Ibrahim Dasuki became the 18th Sultan of Sokoto during a
traditional ceremony of pomp and prayer in which he was crowned with
a turban. Police and soldiers stood guard.
   He succeeds Sadiq Abubakar, who led the Moslem community for 50
years before his death Nov. 1 at the age of 85.
   Three days after Abubakar died, a nine-member committee known as
the ``kingmakers'' gave the title to Dasuki, 65, a former civil
servant and previous secretary of Nigeria's Supreme Council for
Islamic Affairs.
   On Nov. 6, the military governor approved Dasuki as the new
sultan, touching off two days of rioting by Moslems who favored
Abubakar's elder son, Muhammadu Maccido.
   Radio Nigeria said rioters burned buildings, including a radio
station and a branch of the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, of which Dasuki is chairman.
   Officials ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew with soldiers patrolling
the streets.
   Before order was restored, 10 people were killed and dozens more
were hurt, including at least five policemen who were seriously
injured. Authorities have not said how the 10 civilians died.
   Sokoto is 465 miles north of Lagos, the capital.
   The sultan's position is powerful, heading the Moslems who make
up 47 percent of Nigerians. He also is revered by Moslems in
neighboring countries and frequently is consulted by Nigerian
politicians of all denominations.
   Christians account for 34 percent of the nearly 103 million
people in Nigeria, black Africa's most populous and powerful nation.
Most other Nigerians are animists.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto drew 20,000 people to
rally of her populist party in Peshawar and the rightist opposition
attracted an equal crowd in Lahore on Monday, the last day of
campaigning for national elections.
   Ms. Bhutto ended the campaign of her Pakistan People's Party for
the Wednesday election at Peshawar, a northwestern border city in
the heart of the region where more 3 million Afghan refugees live.
   The nine-party Islamic Democratic Alliance chose the old Punjab
capital of Lahore for its last rally, which was preceded by a slow
procession through the streets of the northeastern city.
   Witnesses said a Bhutto rally at Lahore on Sunday attracted
``record-breaking'' crowds whose procession arrived at the rally
site eight hours late. About 60 percent of Pakistan's 107 million
people live in Punjab.
   Shaukat Ali, a journalist for the English-language Lahore
newspaper Dawn, said some people at the Sunday rally were those
``who just want to get a look'' at Ms. Bhutto, who is from Sind, a
southern province, and pays few visits to the north.
   Leading the Islamic Alliance rally Monday was Nawaz Sharif, the
Punjab chief minister.
   Ms. Bhutto's main opposition comes from the alliance on the right
and the Awami National Party on the far left.
   At Peshawar's Jinnah Park, named for Mohammed Ali Jinnah, founder
of Pakistan, Mrs. Bhutto said Monday her party champions workers and
farmers. She said the Islamic Alliance, which includes loyalists of
the late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, has ``become an opposition
alliance against the People's Party.''
   Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, founded the Pakistan People's
Party and it carried him to power in 1973.
   Zia overthrew Bhutto in 1977. The former prime minister was
convicted of conspiring to kill a political rival, who was not
slain, and was hanged in 1979.
   Zia died in a plane crash Aug. 17, along with the U.S. ambassador
and 28 other people. Pakistani investigators said they suspected
sabotage, but the cause has not been established.
   Only a few women are involved in the election campaign, and
Benazir Bhutto alluded at Monday's rally to Moslem fundamentalists
who oppose the prospect of a woman leader.
   ``As a woman I am your sister. You are my force. Your success is
my success,'' she told her supporters, who had begun gathering three
hours earlier for her 20-minute speech.
   Officials ordered all campaigning to end at midnight Monday.
Federal and provincial authorities announced the mobilization of
police, army and paramilitary forces to guard against violence
during a lengthy voting period that runs through provincial assembly
elections Saturday.
   Officials said security would be tightest in Hyderabad and
Karachi, southern cities where nearly 300 people were killed in
September during ethnic riots with a political undertone in
September.
   At stake Wednesday are the 217 National Assembly seats, and the
party winning the most will have first chance at forming a
government. On Saturday, voters will chose the 483 members of the
four provincial legislatures.
   No reliable polls have been conducted but the election is seen
mainly as a contest betwen Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning party and the
Islamic Alliance, whose main leaders are Sharif, the Punjab chief
minister, and former Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo.
   It will be the first democratic election since the one that swept
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to power in 1973. He was re-elected in 1977 but
Zia nullified the vote after the coup, declaring it rigged.
   Parties rather than issues have dominated the campaign. Ms.
Bhutto has abandoned her father's unsuccessful policy of
nationalizing industry and, like the Islamic Alliance, pledges
continued close relations with the United States and aid to
anti-communist guerrillas in Afghanistan.
   Both favor Pakistan's nuclear research program, which the
government says is for peaceful purposes.
   Pakistan's 48 million eligible voters, three-fourths of them
illiterate, must present government identity cards in order to cast
ballots. Officials said about 93 percent of eligible voters had
cards, but Ms. Bhutto claimed the percentage was far lower.
   She has urged supporters who do have not been given cards to
demonstrate peacefully at voting stations.

   Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said today Latin American nations should close ranks behind a
``new diplomacy'' aimed at pressuring the region's dictatorships
into making democratic reforms.
   ``The time is right for a new diplomacy _ a diplomacy based on
democractic solidarity and on the aggressive advocacy of democracy
by democratic states,'' Shultz said in a speech to Organization of
American States foreign ministers.
   In comments while en route here for an eight-hour visit, Shultz
said democracies in the region should consider ways to make
Nicaragua ``feel a sense of isolation'' as a means of promoting
democratic reform.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte convened the weeklong OAS meeting
with a condemnation of leftist guerrillas battling waging a
9-year-old war against his U.S.-backed government. He also urged
debt relief for the hemisphere's nations.
   Duarte also called upon delegates to provide ``moral support''
for an eventual summit meeting of Central American presidents that
would try to breathe new life into a regional peace process begun in
August 1987.
   ``What is at stake is not just peace in Central America, but the
security of the entire continent,'' he said.
   In Shultz's comments, he singled out Paraguay and Cuba as
countries which have not been part of the democratic trend in the
hemisphere.
   Shultz criticized the OAS for what he regards as its indifferent
attitude toward the hemisphere's democratic development.
   ``This organization has not always been out front on issues
concerning democracy,'' Shultz told the delegates. ``Too often it
has been one step behind when it has needed to be one step ahead.''
   He suggested the OAS has been negligent in not insisting that
Nicaragua live up to its 1979 commitment to a pluralistic political
system.
   ``Agreements exist; promises have been made,'' he said. ``The
dictators and the totalitarians must be told they are not free to
subjugate their peoples.''
   A return trip to Washington is planned for tonight.
   In an interview last week, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams said the Sandinistas have been so unyielding on democratic
reform that ``they've disappointed people who are even moderately
sympathetic to them.''
   He said there has been an increase in repression in Nicaragua
this year, including the continued detention of about 40 persons
involved in an anti-government protest last June.
   The Sandinistas contend U.S. efforts to destabilize Nicaragua are
continuing despite the military aid cutoff to the Contras. They cite
a statement two months ago by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., that
the administration was trying to disrupt peace talks in Nicaragua by
having the CIA ``provoke'' a clampdown by the Sandinistas.
   Shultz has been a frequent visitor to El Salvador over the years,
and the officials said today's speech was to include numerous
expressions of esteem and affection for Duarte, who is dying of
cancer.
   Duarte, who is in the last year of a five-year term, has been
perhaps the closest ally of the United States in the hemisphere and
his government is the biggest recipient of U.S. aid in the region.
   There are diplomats from at least two OAS countries with whom
Shultz had no plans to meet: Panama and Nicaragua. Reagan
administration policy forbids substantive contact with officials
from either government.

<HEAD>Educational Testing Organizations Adopt Code of Fair Practices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six educational testing organizations on Monday
unveiled a new code of practices that commits them to strive for
fairness in tests given students of different races, sex or ethnic
backgrounds.
   The voluntary code also commits the test makers to review and
revise questions ``to avoid potentially insensitive content or
language,'' and to offer ``appropriately modified forms of tests''
to the handicapped.
   The Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education bears the
endorsement of six companies whose tests are taken by millions of
American students each year, from first grade to graduate school.
   The signers of the new code are: Educational Testing Service, the
College Board, the American College Testing Program, CTB@McGraw
Hill, the Psychological Corp. and the Riverside Publishing Co.
   The code lays out 21 standards for both test developers and test
users in four areas: developing and selecting tests; interpreting
scores; striving for fairness; and informing test takers.
   On fairness, it says, ``Test developers should strive to make
tests that are as fair as possible for test takers of different
races, gender, ethnic backgrounds or handicapping conditions.''
   It commits them to investigate the performance of test takers of
differents races, sex and ethnic backgrounds ``when samples of
sufficient size are available,'' and to set up procedures ``to
ensure that differences in performance are related primarily to the
skills under assessment rather than to irrelevant factors.''
   On test selection, the code says the test makers should make
available to ``qualified users'' either ``representative samples or
complete copies of test questions, directions, answer sheets,
manuals and score reports.''
   Robert Schaeffer, a spokesman for FairTest, a Cambrige, Mass.,
group that is critical of standardized testing, said the code
``sounds good in principle, but it lacks teeth.''
   ``What's needed is public oversight and control of the
billion-dollar testing industry,'' Schaeffer said.
   Everyone wants fair tests, he added. ``The question is how do you
make them fair and who is to judge and who punishes those whose
tests are nor fair?''
   The College Board sponsors the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which is
made by ETS. The American College Testing Program makes the ACT, a
rival college-entrance exam. CTB@McGraw Hill makes both the
Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills and the California Achievement
Test. The Psychological Corp. makes both the Stanford and the
Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Riverside Publishing makes the Iowa
Tests of Basic Skills.
   Copies of the code are available from the National Council on
Measurement in Education, 1230 17th St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.

   An 84-year-old man was released without
bail after allegedly trying to smother his wife in a mercy-killing
attempt that failed when she woke up and fought him off, officials
said.
   Town Justice Edward Horne said he released George Wootan without
bail on Sunday on the recommendation of the Suffolk County district
attorney's office.
   Wootan is charged with the attempted murder of his 76-year-old
wife, Olivia, to whom he has been married more than 50 years.
   He told police his wife was in pain and could only sleep after
taking sleeping pills, Horne said Monday. Wootan said he put a
pillow over her on Saturday, but she woke up and thwarted him,
according to Horne.
   Wootan then called police and turned himself in, Horne said.
   Horne said his main concern in releasing Wootan was that he
remain away from his wife until the case is settled. Mrs. Wootan was
in the hospital at the time of the court hearing and has since gone
to stay with a son in upstate New York, he said.
   The justice said that until he learns the woman's wishes, he will
not let them live together. She may decide she does not want to
prosecute, Horne said.
   Horne scheduled a hearing Thursday, when he expects the district
attorney's office to tell him whether it plans to prosecute.

   A small earthquake rumbled through western
Maine early Monday, but no injuries or damage were reported,
authorities said.
   The earthquake, which hit at 1:16 a.m. and measured 3.8 on the
Richter scale, was centered near Sumner, according to John Minsch of
the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center
in Golden, Colo.
   Rumford police Sgt. Mike Boutte said police had received about 65
calls from people who reported feeling the quake. Boutte said there
were no reports of damage.
   The Maine Geological Survey also received a few calls from people
who felt the quake or noticed windows rattling, said the agency's
Mike Foley.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage.

<TEXT>
   Bad weather forced the Air Force
to postpone a plan to explode nearly a half million pounds of
explosives Monday to test a new ordnance storage bunker, a base
spokesman said.
   Len Barry said the enormous blast to test the new Hayman Igloo
design could not be conducted during overcast weather because cloud
cover would reflect the force of the explosion and possibly damage
buildings in populated areas.
   A storm front over northern Utah produced heavy cloud cover and
several inches of snow Monday. Barry said he did not know when the
test would be rescheduled.
   The Air Force had planned to detonate the explosives on the Test
and Training Range west of the Great Salt Lake, 50 to 60 miles from
populated areas.
   Plans had called 450,000 pounds of explosive in one igloo to be
detonated to test the effects on four other igloos built nearby.
   The purpose of the test is to determine how far apart the igloos
should be spaced to prevent an explosion in one from setting off
others.
   The Hayman is designed to channel the force of explosion upward
through the roof and away from other storage bunkers or buildings,
Barry said.
   The Air Force has said that under the proper weather conditions,
the test would pose little risk to the public directly or through
environmental problems.
   The State Bureau of Air Quality issued an open-burning permit for
the test after concluding it would not create significant air
pollution.
   Barry said the Hayman Igloo, developed by Hill Air Force Base
industrial engineering technician Lowell Hayman, costs only $100,000
to build, compared to $500,000 for current ammunition storage
bunkers.
   The Hayman Igloo is made of concrete and steel, as is the current
bunker. However, the Hayman is cheaper because the walls and roof
are prefabricated and assembled on-site. It can be completed in only
two weeks, while the current design, built entirely on site,
requires four months.

aboard, authorities said.
   Rescuers spotted the wreckage of the helium balloon near here and
reached the two men at mid-morning, said Utah Civil Air Patrol
spokesman Jerry Wellman. The were taken by ambulance to Garfield
Memorial Hospital in nearby Panguitch.
   Garfield County sheriff's dispatcher Cathy Holt said Ron Martin,
46, of Long Beach and Scott Hendricks, 30, of Chino, suffered broken
bones and complained of back injuries.
   The long-range balloon had taken off Sunday evening from a
parking lot near Disneyland in Orange County, Calif.
   Hajnal Crieg, who along with Martin owns the four-passenger,
3,500-cubic-foot balloon, said Martin, the craft's pilot, and
Hendricks, his friend, had intended only to take a tour of the Los
Angeles basin.
   ``But a storm came in. You can't really control a helium balloon,
so they went wherever the wind takes them,'' she said of the trip,
which ended about 500 air miles east of Los Angeles. ``They were
just on an overnight trip.''
   The crew had radioed air traffic controllers this morning that it
was losing altitude and needed emergency assistance. The Federal
Aviation Administration said it lost radar contact about 10 miles
south of Circleville.
   While a snowstorm enveloped much of the state, weather was clear
in southern Utah today, allowing an immediate search, Wellman said.
However, the National Weather Service had issued a high-wind warning
for the area in the morning.
   A balloon reported to have taken off near Disneyland on Sunday
apparently was not connected to the amusement park, said spokesman
Bob Roth.

   U.S. congressmen told President
Corazon Aquino on Monday that Washington will honor a pledge of more
economic aid and urged Manila to extend an agreement on U.S.
military bases after 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino told the Americans her government must achieve the
``widest consensus'' among Filipinos for ``entangling foreign
commitments.''
   The six-member delegation, led by Senate Minority Leader Robert
Dole, met with Mrs. Aquino and Philippine officials on the first
stop of a four-nation tour of Southeast Asia.
   The other members of the delegation were Sens. James McClure,
R-Idaho, Arlen Specter, R-Pa., Franck Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Reps.
Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., and William Lehman, D-Fla.
   Dole said President-elect George Bush will honor a commitment
made by President Reagan to support a multinational aid package to
bolster the Philippine economy.
   ``It's not just some statement, some rhetorics. It's going to
happen,'' Dole told reporters.
   Last month, Reagan pledged in a letter to Mrs. Aquino to work
with Japan, South Korea, West Germany and other U.S. allies to
develop the aid plan.
   The letter was delivered shortly after the United States and the
Philippines concluded an agreement Oct. 17 that guarantees U.S.
military use of six bases through 1991 in exchange for $962 million
in American aid.
   Any extension of the agreement beyond that year must be approved
by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition
to the bases is strong.
   ``It is in the interest of both countries that we work out
appropriate arrangements fully consistent with Philippine
sovereignty that would permit continuation of access to the bases
facilities,'' the congressmen said in a statement.
   U.S. officials have said privately they would like to begin talks
on a new treaty early next year. The pact expires Sept. 16, 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino told the delegation that as democracies, the
Philippines and the United States ``need the widest consensus and
the most willing support for entangling foreign commitments.'' She
made no direct reference to the U.S. bases.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus told reporters he briefed the
delegation on the results of a recent survey that showed about 75
percent of the 1,200 people polled favored extending the bases
beyond 1991. About 25 percent of the supporters, however, wanted
better financial terms from Washington.
   The delegation also will visit Bangkok, Thailand, Singapore and
Indonesia.

<HEAD>Mixed Views On Ethics Of Judges' Periodical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A periodical that summarizes unpublished
opinions from Kentucky's Court of Appeals and Supreme Court is being
marketed by two appeals court judges who say there is nothing
unethical about the venture.
   About 50 subscriptions _ at $200 a year for law firms and $160
for sole practitioners _ have been sold since the publication began
in September, said Judge Michael McDonald, who started the
``Kentucky Legal Practitioner'' with Judge John P. Hayes.
   McDonald said he and Hayes view the venture not as a moneymaker
but as ``a good way to get more of the work of Kentucky's appellate
courts into the hands of busy, practicing attorneys.''
   The opinions summarized in the publication are ones the state
Supreme Court has decided are not worth having published in law
books. Unpublished opinions cannot be cited as precedents in other
cases.
   Experts on judicial ethics said they knew of no similar
periodical elsewhere in the country published by appellate judges.
   Some lawyers and legal ethicists questioned the propriety of the
judges' venture, but McDonald said such questions were ``absolutely
the most absurd thing I have ever heard of.''
   The Code of Judicial Conduct says a judge ``shall refrain from
financial and business dealings'' that tend to ``exploit his
judicial position or involve him in frequent transactions with
lawyers or persons likely to come before the court on which he
serves.''
   Judges may manage investments and ``engage in other remunerative
activity,'' but should not serve as ``an officer, director, manager,
advisor or employee of any business.''
   Another portion of the code, however, says judges may speak,
write, lecture or teach on legal subjects if, in doing so, they
don't cast doubt on their impartiality.
   McDonald said he believes the summaries of unpublished opinions
will be ``extremely useful'' research tools.
   Kentucky's appellate courts issue hundreds of decisions each year
but most, by court order, are not published in law books when the
Court of Appeals decides they offer no new guidance on legal issues.
   But some of the appellate judges have bridled under rules that
allow the Supreme Court to veto the lower court's decision that an
opinion should be published.
   In their first issue, the judges said they started the periodical
because the state Supreme Court had ``frustrated'' moves to allow
lawyers to cite such unpublished opinions as precedent in arguing
cases.
   Experts on legal ethics said they believe it is improper for
judges to produce such a publication.
   Professor Stephen Gillers of New York University said lawyers who
appear before the judges might feel pressure to subscribe to the
service, and that litigants represented by lawyers who don't
subscribe might question the judges' impartiality.
   Professor Geoffrey Hazard of Yale University said he thinks the
publication is improper because it requires the judges to summarize
decisions of their colleagues. ``You can't neutrally summarize
opinions,'' he said.
   However, another leading ethicist, Professor Roald Rotunda of the
University of Illinois, said judges wouldn't automatically violate
the code in producing such a publication, as long as it doesn't take
up too much of their time.
   McDonald said he spends less than an hour each week on the
periodical and former and current staff attorneys of the Court of
Appeals write the summaries at home in their spare time. He said no
court equipment or supplies are used.
   The Hayes-McDonald enterprise offers subscribers the full text of
opinions for 75 cents a page. Such opinions may be obtained directly
from the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals by mail for 30 cents a
page.

   Walkouts by the orchestra have disrupted
rehearsals of ``William Tell,'' the Gioacchino Rossini opera which
is scheduled to inaugurate La Scala's season in December.
   A theater spokesman reported Monday that six rehearsals have been
canceled so far and that others are being put at risk by the labor
unrest.
   Members of the orchestra have been refusing to show up for
rehearsals to press their demands for higher pay and fringe benefits.
   The theater management has countered that pay increases can not
be immediately granted because of a recent government decision to
cut back on funds allocated to opera houses.
   ``William Tell,'' directed by maestro Riccardo Muti and starring
Chris Merritt, is to be performed on a gala night inaugurating the
opera season Dec. 7.

<HEAD>Mansfield Retures After 11 Years as Ambassador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mike Mansfield announced his retirement Monday after
11 years as U.S. ambassador to Japan and a public service career
that began at age 14, when he lied about his age to enter the Navy
during World War I.
   The 85-year-old former Senate majority leader has worked
tirelessly for strong U.S.-Japanese relations, which he described as
excellent, with most problems resolved. He said he would leave his
post before Jan. 1.
   Mansfield said he and his wife, Maureen, made the decision
together.
   ``We decided it was time for me to resign, subject to the will of
the president, and that has been done,'' the Democrat from Montana
told reporters at the U.S. Embassy. He said they would divide their
time between Washington and his home state, spending winters in
Florida.
   Senior Japanese officials expressed appreciation for Mansfield's
years of effort for improved relations.
   ``It is very regrettable that Ambassador Mansfield is
resigning,'' aides quoted Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno as saying.
``He was a good friend who understands Japan quite well.
   ``It was truly fortunate that we had a person like Ambassador
Mansfield in Tokyo for a long time. ... His warm personality has
earned everyone's respect and love.''
   Mansfield set records for length of service with 16 years as
Senate majority leader and 11 as ambassador to Japan.
   The Japanese welcomed his appointment to the Tokyo mission by
President Jimmy Carter because of Mansfield's prestige in Congress
and his belief in the importance of East Asia to the United States.
   He has called the next century the ``century of the Pacific
basin'' and often said the relationship with Japan is the most
important to Washington, ``bar none.''
   Speculation arose that Mansfield would retire after coronary
bypass surgery in January, but he returned to work in the spring.
The ambassador said Monday he and his wife agreed at the time to
delay retirement until after major trade issues were resolved and
the U.S. presidential election was over.
   The recent U.S. decision, with Mansfield's support, against
trying to force the opening of the Japanese rice market at this time
helped clear the way for his retirement, he said.
   Trade problems are the major cause of friction between the United
States and Japan but relations generally are in ``excellent shape,''
Mansfield said.
   `In the field of politics and diplomacy we work very well
together,'' he told the news conference. ``In the field of security,
the relationship couldn't be better, and in the area of investment
things are going very nicely.''
   Some people both in and outside the U.S. government have
criticized Mansfield as being too accommodating toward the Japanese.
   He says in response that Japanese markets have opened in many
ways and Japan has assumed a significant part of the security burden
in Asia. He advocates a broad trade agreement to ease friction and
the idea is being studied, but is unlikely to materialize soon.
   Mansfield said Monday he treated the Japanese as he would wish to
be treated and they responded in kind. he called the Tokyo years
``the most enjoyable in our lives.''
   After beginning seven decades of service to the United States
with the Navy enlistment at 14, Mansfield served in the Army and the
Marine Corps. He was in Asia with the Marines.
   Before his election to Congress in 1942, he taught Far Eastern
and Latin American history at Montana State University in Missoula.
The school since has been renamed the University of Montana.
   In 1944, Mansfield was sent on a foreign policy mission to China
at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Before his
appointment to Tokyo, he had returned to China several times at the
Chinese government's invitation.

<HEAD>Shultz Calls For `Aggressive Advocacy' of Democracy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin American democracies have
been too permissive of dictatorships in their midst and should
vigorously promote constitutional rule, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said Monday.
   ``The time is right for a new diplomacy _ a diplomacy based on
democratic solidarity and on the aggressive advocacy of democracy by
democratic states,'' he told a meeting of Organization of American
States foreign ministers.
   On what is expected to be the last of his many trips to Latin
America during six years in office, Shultz challenged the
democracies to ``go out on a limb to pressure non-democratic
neighbors to open up. We need to confront these states with a
diplomacy by democracies, for democracy.''
   Shultz said the OAS had not led the struggle for democracy even
though the organization is based on democratic principles.
   The remarks appeared to reflect Shultz's frustration over the
lack of hemispheric backing for a stronger stand against Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government.
   Reagan administration support for Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras, has been given little approval and sometimes has created
hostility.
   The secretary made only a passing reference to Nicaragua,
asserting that the Sandinista government has not fulfilled a 1979
pledge to the OAS to establish a democratic system. The leftist
rebels overthrew the pro-U.S. government of the late President
Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
   On the plane from Washington, Shultz said Paraguay and Cuba also
have have not joined a trend toward democratic rule that began nine
years ago and now encompasses about 90 percent of the hemisphere's
people.
   In his remarks to reporters, he offered no specific suggestions
about what the OAS might do to promote democracy in Nicaragua, but
said it should consider ways in which ``Nicaragua would feel a sense
of isolation.''
   He said Nicaragua has become an economic ``basket case'' but
continues to be a threat to its neighbors because of its large army
and continued military support from the Soviet Union.
   Shultz said the Reagan administration has differences with
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, but he commended Arias for
``forthright'' comments on the lack of progress toward democracy in
Nicaragua.
   ``That's what everybody should do,'' Shultz said.
   Arias won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for devising a regional
peace plan 987for Central America that was signed Aug. 7, 1987 by
Arias and the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and
Guatemala.
   Nicaragua has said it is committed to a democratic system and
accuses the United States of continued efforts to undermine the
Sandinsta revolution, despite the cutoff by Congress in February of
aid to the Contras.
   In his speech to the OAS, Shultz said 32-nation hemispheric group
``has not always been out front on issues concerning democracy.
``Too often it has been one step behind when it has needed to be one
step ahead.''
   ``As we challenge others to adopt democracy, we need to hold them
to their promises and commitments. No one is fooled by empty
promises,'' he declared.

   Federal and state agents have arrested a man
accused of intimidating hunters for years, stealing their game at
gunpoint and chasing them off public land, earning the nickname the
``bull of the woods.''
   Tommy L. Williams, 53, of Montgomery, was arrested Sunday after
he led a group of about a dozen companions who tried to take deer
from other hunters and eject them from the Sam Houston National
Forest, Billy Ball, special agent for the U.S. Forest Service, said
Monday.
   Unknown to Williams, the hunters were undercover federal and
state agents. Williams pointed a shotgun at the agents while
threatening them, officials said. His companions have not been
arrested.
   ``We were hunting the hunters this weekend,'' said Ball, who
participated in the operation north of Houston in Montgomery County.
``Our concern is all these threats going on. There will be
additional undercover operations.
   ``He confronted us and wanted to take part of our game. We ID'd
him based on information from other hunters.''
   Williams was ordered to appear in federal court on misdemeanor
charges of threatening three hunters. Three other minor charges were
to be filed against him, Ball said. Conviction carries a maximum
penalty of six months in prison and $500 fine.
   ``He's had a reputation for threatening and intimidating hunters
for years,'' Ball said. ``I think we dehorned the bull of the
woods.''

<HEAD>Reagan on Woman President: `I Welcome It.'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Monday the United States
inevitably will have a woman president, and ``I welcome it.''
   But during a question-and-answer session with a group of school
children in the State Dining Room of the White House, Reagan also
said he thought a woman would likely get to the Oval Office only by
serving first as vice president.
   Asked whether there would ever be a woman chief executive, he
replied, ``I don't know. Believe, I'm certainly not against it. ...''
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of England,
Margaret Thatcher, and she's done a remarkable job for England,''
the president said.
   Reagan will play host to Mrs. Thatcher for an official visit and
state dinner at the White House later this week. The British prime
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the Western
Alliance during his nearly eight years in office.
   As for a women president, Reagan said the idea would take ``a
little getting used to on the part of some people. But I think it's
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president
because they've come up in so many different fields.''
   He added: ``It's just my feeling that probably, rather than one
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with,
that maybe it would probably start with one of them, as we did in
the election in 1984, ... running for vice president. She didn't
make it, but that might be the start of it, and I welcome it.''
   Reagan was referring to then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., who
had the second spot on the Democratic ticket headed by then-Vice
President Walter F. Mondale.
   Reagan swept to a 49-state landslide over the ticket, with the
Mondale-Ferraro team carrying only Mondale's home state of Minnesota
and the District of Columbia.
   Reagan's appearance before students from five Washington-area
junior and senior high schools was the first of four such talks the
president plans to give before leaving office on Jan. 20.
   Before taking questions from the pupils, Reagan told his audience
that he would look to young people to carry forth the message of the
American revolution to the rest of the world. But as the world goes
through rapid technological and social change, he said, ``the
permanent truths which give meaning to our lives don't change.''

<TEXT>
   More than 200 narcotics fugitives responsible
for $5.8 billion in U.S. drug sales were captured during a 10-week
sweep of the Southeastern Gulf states, officials said Monday.
   Marshals said their calulations showed that if these fugitives
were a corporation, sales would rank 71st on the Fortune 500 list.
   Investigative teams worked in Tampa, Jacksonville and Miami,
Mobile, Ala., New Orleans and Galveston, Texas. Fugitives targeted
were on the run from two to 13 yearm accused
Colombian smugglers to street dealers.
   ``This program demonstrats and ranged froes that if the government
would commit
the resources to the drug-trafficking war, then we could win the
war,'' said Miami U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen. ``The problem in
the war has not been that the dopers are unapprehendable or that the
government cannot find them _ the problem is that the public is not
yet committed to winning the war on drugs.''
   More than $1.2 million in cash and property seized from the
fugitives as illegal proceeds of narcotics activity went to pay the
tab for operation WANT II, a code-name for warrant apprehension
narcotics team.
   Altogether, 249 people were arrested, 218 of them narcotics
fugitives. And 402 warrants were cleared, representing 10 percent of
the outstanding drug fugitivd by
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and other Democratic leaders,
including Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio, a potential rival.
   That all but assures his selection as chairman when the House
Democratic Caucus meets Dec. 6.
   Gonzalez will be taking over at the start of a critical year for
the committee. Regulators estimate as much as $50 billion is needed
to clean up the S&L mess and analysts agree nearly uniformly that it
will require government help.
   The committee also is expected to take another try at a
fundamental restructuring of the financial system, allowing greater
mingling of commercial banks and securities firms. Third World debt
is likely to get attention, too.
   Both the S&L crisis and new bank powers have been divisive issues
and Congress couldn't agree on legislation this year. Sen. Donald W.
Riegle, D-Mich., is expected to succeed the retiring William
Proxmire, D-Wis., as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and
Urban Affairs Committee, meaning both chambers of Congress will have
new banking leaders in 1989.
   ``It's hard not to believe this is going to slow momentum,'' said
R. Dan Brumbaugh, a savings industry consultant and former chief
economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   The changeover in Congress means the new Bush administration
likely will take the lead in forging a solution to the S&L problem,
he said. ``However, nothing of a significant magnitude can get done
without the concurrence of the House committee,'' he said.
   Gonzalez has generally opposed permitting banks to get involved
with securities underwriting, but he said recently that he also
takes a pragmatic view and recognizes that the financial system is
changing and Congress must change with the times.
   Last summer, Gonzalez said he favored an immediate $50 billion
loan from the Treasury to quickly resolve the S&L crisis. He has
also expressed sympathy for S&Ls in his home state, where most of
the industry's losses are concentrated, arguing they were victimized
by the drop in oil prices and the consequent decline in Southwestern
real estate prices.
   ``He has strong feelings about the industry's inability to pay,
and that's encouraging,'' said Frederick Webber, the newly appointed
president of the savings industry's largest trade group, the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions.
   Webber said the industry will not be sorry to see the departure
of St Germain, who was defeated following disclosure of Justice
Department allegations that he accepted thousands of dollars in
entertainment and meals from S&L lobbyists.
   ``I know the allegations have been that the industry was in bed
with Freddy, but look at his record. The chairman did not go out of
his way to help the industry, not by a long shot,'' Webber said.
   Gonzalez gets high marks from colleagues for personal integrity
and his willingness to speak his mind. They also say he is a
likeable man, despite a temper that caused him two years ago to slug
a man who called him a communist.
   However, many question Gonzalez's ability to rein in his own
views enough to ride herd on a committee with more than 50 members
and nearly as many factions.
   ``He is not a dumb man. He's bright. He understands problems and
he can be very direct with what he says. But it's one thing to be
able to make cogent comments and its another thing to be able to
forge a legislative compromise. That may be where he has problems,''
said Bert Ely, a financial institutions consultant in Alexandria, Va.
   In 1977, Gonzalez was appointed to chair a special committee to
investigate the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr. But after holding the position for only weeks, he
fired the chief counsel and then quit, leaving the committee in
turmoil.
   As chairman of the Banking subcommittee on housing since 1981,
Gonzalez has shown a confrontational style. He once called Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce, the only black member
of the Reagan Cabinet, ``a Stepin Fetchit.''
   He also had advocated the impeachment of former Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Paul Volcker, who was pushing up interest rates in
the early 1980s to fight inflation.
   But former Rep. Henry A. Reuss, a Wisconsin Democrat who preceded
St Germain as Banking Committee chairman, says Gonzalez may do
better than many expect.
   Under the Reagan administration it just has not been possible to
pass housing legislation, Reuss said, adding that Gonzalez has
``shown a capacity to learn and grow ... and I think that will stand
Congress in good stead.''
   Gonzalez, addressing the National Association of Mortgage Brokers
on Monday, answered his critics, saying, ``I've never considered
myself an ideologue no matter how I've been labeled. You (can't)
last in politics unless you're in the traditional American vein of
pragmatism.''
   After the speech, he told reporters that much of the criticisms
circulating were ``hobgoblins calculatedly set forth by those who
... have ambitions themselves.''
   Ely said if Gonzalez proves to be a weak chairman, it could tip
control of the committee to various senior Democrats, depending on
the issue, or to the Republican minority.
   ``If the Democrats split a lot, that puts the Republicans in the
driver's seat. ... They may, in effect, decide which faction among
the Democrats wins out,'' he said. ``What we're going to see is a
more tulmultuous committee.''

   Christina LoCasto, 24, was ordered to return to San Mateo County
Municipal Court on Jan. 19, when a date will be set for a
preliminary hearing, held to determine if someone should stand trial.
   LoCasto, of New York, had pleaded innocent to one felony count of
child endangerment. If tried and convicted, she could face a
three-year prison sentence.
   A United Airline worker found newborn Alyssa LoCasto under the
sink of a United jet he was cleaning after passengers left a flight
from Newark, N.J., to San Francisco on July 13.
   Authorities used a passenger list to trace LoCasto.
   Custody of the child has been awarded to her paternal
grandparents, John and Frances LoCasto, of Staten Island, N.Y. The
parents are allowed to visit six hours a week, under supervision of
a social worker.

   They thought about chopping off Sybil
Luddington's head, and they thought about boring holes into her
skull. But so far they've contented themselves with putting a gasbag
over her head.
   Sybil was the 16-year-old heroine who rode through the
countryside warning colonists that the British were burning Danbury,
Conn., in 1778.
   She has been memorialized in a song, a poem, a postage stamp and
a statue put up in 1961 on the shore of Lake Gleneida in Carmel.
   But the statue has been acting up lately, acquiring the
unbecoming habit of foaming at the mouth.
   Suggestions were made to decapitate it to examine what was
causing the foaming, and boring holes to see what was inside.
   But on Sunday, metallurgist Terry Lowe put a plastic bag over the
head of the statue and pumped it full of gas.
   He said he had identified the foam as calcium sulphate, or
gypsum, and believes it was part of a plaster mold left behind when
the statue was made. He thinks the residue is seeping from the pores
in the bronze.
   Lowe said he will watch the bag for signs that the gas is
escaping into the statue, which would confirm that there are such
pores.

   An 11-year-old boy stole a bus Monday morning and
took it on a wild seven-block ride which led to four collisions and
left one woman and the boy injured, the Transit Authority said.
   The boy climbed in the 40-foot, 13-ton bus in a Brooklyn
maintenance yard, and pulled out onto the street, where the
accidents quickly began, said TA spokesman Bob Slovak.
   Slovak said the bus smashed into the left side of a parked fire
engine; crashed into the left side of a parked truck; collided
head-on into a car, injuring a woman inside; and careened into a
pillar beneath subway tracks.
   The youth bailed out of the moving bus between the second and
third accidents, said Slovak. He was injured in one of the first two
crashes, and was taken to St. Mary's Hospital.
   Police were investigating why the boy was not in school, Slovak
said.
   Slovak was unsure where the driver of the moving car was taken,
and had no details on her injuries. The bus went just seven blocks
before smashing into the pillar, he said.

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels ambushed a bus in
northeastern Sri Lanka and opened fire on the passengers, killing at
least 27 people, police said.
   Three people also were injured in the morning attack on the
state-run public bus near Pinkatiya village, about 146 miles
northeast of Colombo, said a police official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Soldiers were searching the area for at least 15 attackers who
fled after the killings, he said.
   The victims are believed to be Sinhalese, including several women
and children.
   In Colombo, President Junius R. Jayewardene called a meeting with
the powerful Buddhist clergy who have been calling for him and his
Cabinet to resign. Government sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said no agenda has been fixed for the Monday night
meeting.
   The island nation off the southern coast of India is facing two
violent uprisings _ the lingering Tamil rebellion in the northeast
and a backlash by radical Sinhalese in the south.
   The mostly Buddhist Sinhalese claim government peace overtures to
the predominantly Hindu Tamils grant too many concessions to the
minority community.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil militant
group, say the government's offers fell below expectations to end
alleged discrimination in jobs and education. They are continuing
their 5-year-old war for an independent homeland.
   The ambush came six days before local elections in the
Tamil-dominated northeast province.
   The Tigers have vowed to disrupt the election of the first
provincial council with limited autonomy. It was sanctioned by an
Indian-brokered peace accord in July 1987 and was meant to appease
Tamil demands for self-rule.
   Radical Sinhalese, mainly from the People's Liberation Front,
have stepped up demands for Jayewardene's resignation and called a
four-day strike last week.
   It caused severe food and fuel shortages, especially in the
Sinhalese-dominated south, and crippled the tourism industry that
brings in $67 million a year.
   Armed with broad new powers to combat the Sinhalese threat, the
Sri Lankan army went on television Monday warning it will crush any
group that tries to bring down Jayewardene's government.
   ``The armed forces have been vested with enough power by the
government to deal with any group or movement which threatens the
sovereignty, independence and the very existence of the democratic
form of government,'' said a statement read by an unidentified army
officer.
   The government says the People's Liberation Front has killed at
least 550 people, mostly Sinhalese government officials and
supporters, since the peace accord was signed.
   On Wednesday, the army got orders to shoot anti-government
demonstrators on sight. The following day, soldiers killed at least
18 people when they opened fire on protesters in three southern
towns.
   On Friday, Jayewardene issued an emergency decree providing a
maximum sentence of death by hanging for anyone convicted of
instigating a strike.
   Seventy-five percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people are
Sinhalese, who control most government and military jobs.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of the population.

   The next first lady of the United
States had one request for the news media on Monday: ``Please don't
take pictures of me swimming.''
   ``My children are complaining all across the country,'' Barbara
Bush laughingly told photographers and television crews who staked
out the beach near the vacation home where she and her husband are
staying.
   President-elect George Bush chimed in with his daughter's
reaction to photographs of her mother swimming in a modest one piece
bathing suit: ``I could tell you exactly what Dorothy said when she
called in, but I don't use those kinds of words in front of the
national press corps.''
   Mrs. Bush is an avid swimmer, sometimes doing a mile at a time.
Both she and the president-elect have been seen daily since Thursday
in the balmy waters off the ocean-front home of their friend William
Stamps Farish III.
   The Bushes traded quips with reporters at the conclusion of a
question-and-answer session on the beach. Photographers told Bush
that if he planned to fish as usual that afternoon, he should try to
do so a little closer to the line behind which Secret Service agents
require the film crews to stand.
   ``Barbara says if you don't take pictures of her swimming, I'll
fish here,'' Bush joked.
   He also said noted that he has taken to wearing a T-shirt when he
swims, so nobody can snap revealing pictures of him.
   Talking about how he has enjoyed his few days at the beach, he
said:
   ``I think my mental attitude is in much better shape. I know my
body is. I'm sure everybody can attest to that, to these long
lenses, these long penetrating lenses which cause us to wear
T-shirts when we go swimming and all this kind of thing because we
don't want to be analysed by the doctors from the New York Times.''
   Reflecting further on the vacation time at the end of a long
political campaign, Bush said, ``You get to clear your mind. You get
to think a little bit about the future, you see these tremendous
problems but you just get refurbished in your desire to do the best
job you can.''
   He said he has run and fished every day.
   ``I love the fishing. It doesn't matter what you catch. It's the
fact you're out there and fishermen know that.
   ``And so I'm still of the Isaac Walton school _ that the days I
spend fishing should not be deducted from the time I spend on
earth.''

   President-elect George Bush took a
cautious approach on Monday when asked about the political
aspirations of his oldest son, George W. Bush.
   In a beachfront question-and-answer session, a reporter
questioned Bush on speculation that his 42-year-old son would run
for governor of Texas.
   `I never intervene in primaries, and I expect if any of the Bush
boys ran they would have primaries. But I have no reason to believe
that he's going to do that which you asked about,'' Bush replied.
   His son, a graduate of Harvard Business School, campaigned full
time for his father's White House bid.
   He previously ran unsuccessfully for Congress and has been active
in grassroots politics. He took a leave from his oil company in
Midland, Texas, and moved his family to Washington to work on his
father's campaign.
   It was the younger Bush _ eldest of his five children _ who
announced the Texas delegation vote that put his father over the top
to be nominated at the Republican convention in New Orleans this
past summer.
   In that announcement he called his father, ``the man who made me
proud every single day of my life and a man who will make America
proud, the next president of the United States, my beloved father,
George Bush.''

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek said Monday he expects a
rebuke from the Czechoslovak regime for his outspokenness during his
first trip abroad in 18 years.
   Addressing 300 political science students, Dubcek repeatedly
invoked Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms as
justification for his own failed democratic moves in 1968.
   Since his first day in Italy on Saturday, Dubcek has praised
Gorbachev and criticized current leaders in Czechoslovakia and those
who saw him ousted as party chief shortly after Soviet tanks took
over Prague streets on Aug. 21, 1968.
   The Moscow-led invasion ended his attempt to ease censorship,
allow political freedoms and improve the economy during his few
months as Czechoslovak leader.
   Dubcek spoke animatedly about the Soviet bloc's past and future
in an overcrowded lecture hall at the University of Bologna, which
awarded him an honorary degree Sunday for his defense of personal
liberties.
   Referring to his party's version of events leading to the
invasion, Dubcek told applauding students: ``When I reject these,
what do you think they will tell me when I return home? (They will
say) that I am helping Western propaganda.'' He then joined in the
subsequent applause.
   Dubcek had believed after a meeting with Soviet leaders Aug. 3,
1968, that he could continue his reforms. The official version says
he was warned of the possible consequences.
   In all his appearances, Dubcek, 66, has been intent on convincing
the world he was right to implement his liberalization policy.
   After recounting for his young audience the years of violence
during the Stalinist era, Dubcek said:
   ``Gorbachev is trying to put distance from that system of so many
things that didn't work ...
   ``Many ask why, despite all the enormous difficulties, I continue
to insist that socialism is reformable.
   ``The idea of reform continues to live today ... The 20 years
that have passed have confirmed the rightness of our idea as you see
what is happening in the Soviet Union and other countries.''
   Dubcek said Western support is important for socialism's new
direction and Gorbachev's ``perestroika'' campaign to reform
political and economic policy. He dismissed as unfounded the
speculation that he submitted to some kind of censorship when he
read only excerpts from his highly critical speech at Sunday's award
ceremony. He said he cut out parts to save time since the text had
been published the previous evening.
   Dubcek was expected to spend at least another day in Bologna.
   Venice and Florence also are on his itinerary before his return
sometime next week to Bratislava, Czechoslavakia, near the Austrian
border, where he lives in retirement after years of working at a
lowly forestry department job assigned to him after he was stripped
of party membership in 1970.

<TEXT>
   The financially strapped
Organization of American States opened its General Assembly on
Monday with a warning from its secretary-general that it could
become ``merely a bureaucratic contrivance.''
   Joao Baena Soares, the Brazilian head of the 31-member OAS, also
said that ``a new reality must be created within our hemisphere ...
that will find the OAS to be an effective political forum between
the Americas, north and south.''
   Baena Soares spoke just before Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, who formally opened the week-long session. Duarte, who has
terminal cancer, energetically condemned leftist guerrillas battling
his government and called for support for the stalled Central
American peace process.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz attended the inaugural
session.
   In his speech, Baena Soares addressed two fundamental criticisms
leveled at the OAS since its foundation in 1948: that it is an
ineffective, essentially bureaucratic forum, and that it is
dominated by the United States.
   ``Over this session of the General Assembly there looms a central
issue that must be settled,'' said Baena Soares. ``The member
governments must decide what they want to do with the OAS at this
critical juncture in the life of the Americas.''
   He also lamented the organization's ``extremely difficult
financial circumstances.''
   The OAS is nearly bankrupt because most member nations are far
behind in their dues. The United States, which provides the lion's
share of the budget as well as the OAS headquarters in Washington
owes $41 million.
   ``The (financial) situation has been insurmountable because of a
failure to comply with the legal obligations that establish the
member states' commitment to contribute their quotas,'' Baena Soares
said.
   Baena Soares said in September the U.S. arrears ``severely
affect'' the functioning of the OAS. House Speaker Jim Wright said
at the time that Latin nations interpreted Washington's retention of
funds as an effort to reassert its domination of the forum.
   An OAS commission has recommended that the organization cut its
$66 million budget by 30 percent and fire a fourth of its staff of
1,004. The foreign ministers and heads of delegations meeting here
will decide whether to accept the recommendation.
   Shultz said in a speech that the Reagan administration ``will ask
for full funding of our assessed contribution to the OAS in 1990.''
   Baena Soares declared: ``It is often said that the OAS is too
costly. Indeed it is, if all its diplomatic-political potential is
not used, if it subsists as merely a bureaucratic contrivance.''
   He also called for joint action on Latin America's foreign debt.
The United States, the largest hemispheric creditor, has tried to
discourage tentative efforts by debtor nations to form a block that
would give them more weight in debt negotiations.
   Duarte, 62, called on the OAS delegates to approve a resolution
``that emphatically condemns terrorism and delegitimizes those who
seek political power by violence and terror.''
   He accused leftist rebels waging a 9-year-old war against the
U.S.-backed government of resorting to terrorism.
   Duarte is suffering from liver cancer. Because of weight and hair
loss during chemotherapy, he appeared haggard but he spoke
emphatically in a clear, strong voice.
   Doctors said when the cancer was diagnosed in June that Duarte
had between six and 18 months to live.
   Duarte asked delegates to provide ``moral support'' for an
eventual summit meeting of Central American presidents that would
try to breathe new life into a regional peace process begun in
August 1987.
   ``What is at stake is not just peace in Central America, but the
security of the entire continent,'' he said.
   Diplomats from the five Central American countries _ Guatemala,
El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica _ have been trying
without success for months to set a date and place for a summit.
There has been talk in recent days of a summit before the end of the
year, but nothing has been formalized.

   Workers at a Gulf Coast wildlife
center are trying to nurse back to health an ailing golden eagle,
not normally seen in Mississippi, which was rescued after it plunged
into the Gulf of Mexico.
   Shrimp boat workers said they saw the eagle fly too close to the
water and hit a wave Saturday. Capt. Charlie Schmidt of the Theresa
Maria said he assumed the eagle would fly away on its own, but it
was still there when the ship sailed past the spot an hour later.
   The shrimpers scooped up the bird and a fishing official called
the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, said Robin Berry, director of
the center.
   ``He was in bad shape, very weak and thin,'' Berry said. The
eagle, with an estimated wing span of about five feet, weighed only
about six pounds.
   The eagle was fed liquids through a tube Sunday and was
improving, Berry said.
   Berry and her staff hadn't figured out what weakened the eagle.
``He might have eaten a poisoned rat,'' she said.

   South Africa expressed dissatisfaction Monday at
the pace of talks on peace for southwestern Africa as negotiators
agreed to a second unforeseen day of meetings.
   Cuba, Angola and South Africa continued to search for a
breakthrough in closed-door bilateral talks mediated by U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker.
   South African spokesman Roland Darroll said the latest round,
originally set for three days ending Sunday, would continue Tuesday.
   But he added: ``It seems the more time there is, the more people
take their time.''
   Negotiators agreed to extend the talks after a U.S. delegate, in
an upbeat assessment, cited progress on the issue of a Cuban troop
withdrawal from Angola. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley echoed his optimism. ``We're hopeful that agreement
can be reached,'' she said.
   But a senior South African diplomat cautioned Monday, ``There's
still a lot of ground to cover.''
   ``We are waiting for more complete replies'' from Cuba and Angola
on a U.S. peace plan put forward in October, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He described progress as ``glacial.''
   ``Things are on track, but on a very slow track,'' he said.
   The main remaining issue in the peace effort begun in May is
setting a timetable for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops backing
Angola's Marxist government against South African- and
U.S.-supported UNITA rebels. The other component is a framework to
end South Africa's 73-year control of South-West Africa, or Namibia.
   In New York, the U.N. General Assembly took up a resolution
Monday condemning Pretoria's rule of Namibia. Passage of the measure
was considered certain.
   It calls on South Africa not to link Namibian independence to
``irrelevant and extraneous issues, particularly the presence of
Cuban forces in Angola.''
   Debate was expected to last until Wednesday. Last year, a
virtually identical resolution passed with no opposition. The United
States, Western Europe and Nordic countries abstained.
   The resolution calls on all nations to obey international
boycotts against South Africa, including the mandatory arms embargo.
   It urges member states to increase aid to the South-West Africa
People's Organization, the guerrilla movement which the United
Nations recognizes as the sole representative of Namibia.
   The United States considers SWAPO a terrorist organization and
withholds a small part of its U.N. dues that would be used to fund
SWAPO activities.
   In Geneva on Sunday, a senior U.S. delegate said negotiators have
``never been closer to agreement.''
   However, he added: ``If people can't go the extra mile, you could
see a rapid change of atmosphere.''
   A U.S. proposal reportedly calls for a gradual two-year
withdrawal. Cuba seeks a 2{-year timetable.
   Target date for the start of the pullout is said to be Jan. 1,
the same day a U.N.-supervised process for bringing independence to
Namibia would begin.
   The former German colony Pretoria took over after World War I
lies between South Africa and Angola.

   A five-star restaurant celebrated its second
anniversary by whipping up gourmet fixings for 100 homeless people
at a downtown shelter.
   ``We wanted to mark our anniversary in a way that really hits
home,'' said Victor Gielisse, co-owner of Actuelle. ``It's really
scary to think this is happening so close to home. We were there at
the shelter last week, and it gives you goose bumps to see the kids,
the babies.''
   The gourmet fare was prepared by the restaurant's staff and
served Sunday at the Downtown Dallas Family Shelter. Three waiters
came in on their day off. ``I didn't even have to ask,'' Gielisse
said.
   A typical dinner menu at the shelter consists of chicken-fried
steak, mashed potatoes, canned corn and sheet cake.
   On Sunday, the fare was more upscale: lima bean and black-eyed
pea soup; green salad with basil-vinaigrette dressing; pecan- and
bran-crusted boneless chicken halves; potato pancakes and
praline-chocolate bread pudding. The meals would have cost about $45
each at Actuelle.
   Among the grateful diners were Sylvia Allen of Miami, Fla., and
her 2-year-old son DeQuan, who have lived at the shelter four days.
   ``The baby's father brought us here and just left us,'' Allen
explained. The meal was ``great,'' she said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Monday his
rightist Likud bloc would consider forming a coalition with the
center-left Labor Party, but he ruled out giving the rival party an
equal share of power.
   Shamir, who was chosen by President Chaim Herzog to form a new
government, also tried to defuse concern over the far right's
hard-line stance on the peace process, pledging to make a
``tremendous effort'' to achieve dialogue with the Arabs.
   In parliamentary elections Nov. 1, neither Likud nor its rival,
the center-left Labor Party, won enough parliament seats to gain a
majority in the 120-member body. According to Israeli law, the
president calls on the party with the most support to try to form a
governing coalition.
   Shamir has six weeks to form a coalition, and he was expected to
get the needed 61-seat majority by forming a coalition with small
religious and right-wing parties. Two of those parties endorsed him
Sunday.
   Herzog, however, urged Shamir to include the Labor Party in a
broad coalition similar to the National Unity government that has
been in power since inconclusive elections in 1984.
   The president said his office had been flooded with thousands of
calls urging a unity government. Many Israelis, most of whom are
secular, fear the religious parties will force the passage of laws
that will restrict their daily lives.
   ``The public is worried,'' Herzog said. ``There is a wish for
unity to confront the dangers from outside and the separation
threatening us from within.''
   Later Monday, Shamir invited Labor leader Shimon Peres for
coalition talks Tuesday, said Shamir aide Avi Pazner. Peres accepted
the invitation, Pazner said. He refused to elaborate.
   A unity government would not only blunt the power of the Orthodox
parties but would relieve Shamir of pressure from the extreme right,
which demands annexation of the West Bank and Gaza and the expulsion
of 1.5 million Palestinians who live there.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Shamir agreed to try to form a coalition with Labor. But he made
clear he could not share power equally with Peres as he has for the
past four years, during which each was prime minister for two years
and Cabinet posts were divided.
   ``The government that exists today cannot continue. There can not
be a government that speaks with two voices,'' Shamir said on Israel
radio.
   The Labor Party is divided on joining a Likud-led coalition, and
the dispute could rekindle the rivalry between Peres and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who told the radio a Likud-led government
should be prevented at all costs.
   Shamir sought to appease international concern that his
government would be intransigent toward the Arabs.
   ``The government I shall be able to form, if with God's help I
succeed, will see as one of its primary aims making a tremendous
effort to advance the peace process and reach a dialogue and
agreement with our neighbors,'' Shamir said.
   There was also squabbling within Likud's ranks. Shamir's Likud
rival, Housing Minister David Levy, was disgruntled over reports he
would not get the foreign ministry post and protested that Shamir
gave too many concessions to the religious parties.
   Proposals for a new unity coalition have gained popularity as
concern has grown over promises made to ultra-Orthodox parties,
which have demanded control of influential Cabinet posts in
education, interior and housing as well as controversial legislation.
   Secular Israelis, who make up three-quarters of the nation's 3.5
million Jews, expressed fear that rabbinical control of marriage and
divorce would be increased and coercive laws passed to close pubs,
restaurants, theaters and soccer stadiums on the Sabbath.
   Abroad, U.S. Jews protested Shamir's agreement to religious
demands for a limit on which converts to Judaism would be granted
automatic Israeli citizenship under the so-called Law of Return. The
religious demand it be given only to those converted by Orthodox
rabbis.
   Most of America's 5 million Jews belong to the more liberal
Reform or Conservative strains, and thousands are in mixed
marriages. The legislation would be a slap in the face that could
ultimately undermine political and financial support for Israel.

   The on-stage squabbling that has been the
basis of the Smothers Brothers appeal for 30 years isn't an act, the
brothers insist.
   ``Sometimes, we have an argument right on stage and people don't
know it. They think it's part of the act,'' Dick Smothers said.
   Dick and Tom Smothers began performing as a folk-singing team
when they were students at San Diego State University 30 years ago.
They moved on to the stage and television. Their latest effort is a
series of six specials they did for CBS this season.
   ``What we write comes out of what we really see happening between
them,'' staff writer John Hadley says in the Nov. 19 issue of TV
Guide magazine.
   ``Being at odds with each other has kept them alive and kept them
working,'' he said.
   Tom, 51, plays the sly, but childlike, brother on stage. Dick,
50, said it is ``hard work being his brother'' because Tom ``is a
meticulous taskmaster.''
   ``I go to parties and I want to make sure they run OK, so I
rearrange the furniture,'' said Tom.
   Tom also believes his brother would not be on stage with him if
he had an alternative.
   ``Dickie would never be in show business if I hadn't needed a
singer,'' said Tom. ``And, if he had a choice and could live
comfortably, he'd just as soon be out of it.''

   Howard Rollins Jr., co-star of

possession of cocaine and agreed to make an anti-drug video for the
state of Louisiana.
   Rollins also pleaded guilty to charges of driving while

   State District Judge Freddie Pitcher placed Rollins, 38, on two

   ``I'm grateful to be able to contribute back to the community in

   Rollins was arrested in March when a state trooper clocked him
driving more than 100 mph on Interstate 12 near Baton Rouge. The
trooper found two bags of cocaine in Rollins' jacket, police said.
   Assistant District Attorney Glenn Lorio said there was no plea
bargain. Defense attorney Jim Boren said Rollins entered a substance
abuse program in Pennsylvania after his arrest.
   Rollins, who now lives in Georgia, previously starred in the
movies ``Ragtime'' and ``A Soldier's Story.'' Portions of ``In the

   The creator of the ``Pet Rock'' says he
has spent the last 13 years avoiding publicity and dealing with ``a
bunch of wackos.''
   In 1975, Gary Dahl was a typical advertising executive from Los
Gatos when he came up with the idea of selling the rocks. The Pet
Rock vanished by Valentine's Day 1976, but not before Dahl had sold
1.5 million of them at $4 each.
   ``No one will ever do it again,'' said Dahl, referring to the
phenomenon that swept the country.
   Dahl, 52, is still in advertising but won't say where. He avoided
interviews for years because of what he called ``a bunch of wackos''
appearing out of nowhere with threats and lawsuits.
   ``I really don't know how they find me, but they do,'' he said.
   ``It makes me a lot more cynical,'' he said. ``It made me too
high profile. There's a bizarre lunatic fringe who feel I owe them a
living. I don't know if it's been an asset or a liability.
   ``Sometimes I look back and wonder if my life wouldn't have been
simpler If I hadn't done it,'' he said.

<HEAD>President Vows To Tighten Security After Rebel Commander's Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino vowed Monday
to tighten prison security after a communist rebel commander and his
wife escaped when they were released temporarily from military
detention to attend a party.
   Mrs. Aquino said the government cannot allow its efforts to crush
the 19-year-old communist rebellion ``to go wasted.''
   Romulo Kintanar and his wife escaped from Camp Crame,
headquarters of the Philippine national police force, after
attending a party Saturday in another part of the compound.
   Kintanar, 41, had commanded the 25,000-member communist New
People's Army when he and his 38-year-old wife, Gloria, were
arrested in March. He is believed to be the chief organizer of
assassination squads responsible for killing scores of police
officers and soldiers.
   Officials said Kintanar and his wife slipped away from a birthday
party for Lt. Col. Robelito Comilang, a former prison warden.
   Comilang said he invited Kintanar, his wife and other prisoners
to the party at his home at Camp Crame.
   Kintanar was released from his cell about noon and escorted to
Comilang's home, according to Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao.
   Kintanar and the guard left the party about two hours later and
returned to the prison compound, Dumlao said. Kintanar, his wife and
another rebel prisoner then returned to Comilang's party,
accompanied by the guard, then slipped away.
   Landrito said he did not give permission for Kintanar to leave
his cell the second time because ``I was in my office, sleeping.''
   Relatives of Kintanar's wife claimed the military may have
murdered the couple and fabricated the story as a cover-up.
   Because of the escape, Comilang was placed under house arrest. He
also was relieved of his military duties, as was Gen. Renato de
Villa, the military chief, acting warden Maj. Benjamin Landrito and
camp commander Col. Percival Adiong, according to police spokesman
Lt. Col. Cresencio Maralit. He said three prison guards were
arrested.
   ``I will give instructions that we have to have stricter rules
there,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters. ``We cannot allow all of our
efforts to go wasted simply because of the laxity.''
   Kintanar, who was held in the maximum-security section of the
camp, was the third prominent opponent of the government to escape
custody since April.
   ``There has been more damage in this case to the credibility of
the entire government machinery because you can imagine soldiers and
policemen in the field reacting, `Why will we risk our lives
catching these people? It's so easy for them to escape from
confinement,''' said Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate
defense committee.
   About 160 communist rebels and soldiers arrested in coup plots
are held at Camp Crame.
   In April, Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, leader of the August 1987
coup attempt, escaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay with the help
of his guards. He remains at large.
   A few days later, a Honasan aide, Lt. Col. Eduardo Matillano,
escaped after being allowed to leave his cell to visit a dentist. He
was recaptured in September.

<HEAD>New Group Formed To Press For Multiparty System in Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new group has been formed to press for
multiparty elections with non-communist candidates and to demand
that Hungary renegotiate its ties with the Warsaw Pact, official
media reported Monday.
   The Federation of Free Democrats was launched Sunday at a meeting
of a network of independent political, ecological, religious and
youth groups, according to a participant at the session in
Budapest's Jurta Theater.
   The network, which was established in May, on Sunday split into
two groups _the new federation and a second group that will take a
less active political role, said the participant, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The formation of the new group also was reported by the
government daily Magyar Hirlap and the state news agency MTI.
   Last week, the government approved a draft law that would
legalize independent groups and trade unions, and could pave the way
for a multiparty system. The Communist Party has been Hungary's only
political party since it assumed power in 1948.
   However, Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said that a new law
governing alternative political parties probably would not be ready
until 1990, when a new constitution is to be issued.
   The network of democratic groups formed in May was a loose
organization of about 1,500 individuals who supported democracy, but
was not organized as a purely political group or the nucleus of a
new political party.
   The Federation of Free Democrats intends to ``give its members
some kind of organizing framework with a clear political purpose,''
said the participant.
   The Federation of Free Democrats is headed by a nine-member
committee, including the dissident Ferenc Koeszeg, sociologist
Ottilia Solt, historian Miklos Szabo, pastor Gabor Ivanyi and a
worker, Istvan Vass.
   The new group is calling for the democratic right of association,
the organization of alternative political parties and representation
in Parliament, according to a draft program.
   The group also demands that Hungary renegotiate its ties with the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance and the withdrawal of the
Soviet Union's estimated 65,000 troops from Hungary.
   Another group that has said it intends to support candidates for
Parliament is the Hungarian Democratic Forum, which was established
in September.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Monday
his country and Iran could sign a peace treaty in 10 days if Tehran
is willing, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   ``The phase of interference in the internal affairs of others is
over,'' INA quoted Hussein as saying.
   ``In 10 days, everyone (Iran and Iraq) could be at peace if the
will and decisions were there,'' he told soldiers in Baghdad
receiving medals for valor.
   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq stalled Aug. 25, five days
after a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire halted fighting in the
8-year gulf war.
   Talks in Geneva recessed Friday and are expected to resume soon.
   Both sides blame the other for a deadlock over troop withdrawals
to the pre-war border.
   Iran insists the southern border is the middle of the
Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, as defined by a 1975 treaty.
   Iraq abrogated the treaty a few days before it invaded Iran in
September 1980 and insists the border runs along the eastern,
Iranian bank.
   Tehran radio reported Monday that the two countries agreed to
repatriate more than 1,500 sick or disabled prisoners over a
three-week period starting Sunday.
   The exchange will be organized by the International Committee of
the Red Cross, which is waiting for Iran and Iraq to provide lists
of all other disabled prisoners for another exchange beginning Dec.
5.
   The Red Cross estimates there are more than 100,000 prisoners.
   Hussein said Iraq has been seeking peace since 1985 and would
have accepted the U.N. cease-fire resolution when it was approved on
July 20, 1987.
   Iran equivocated until July this year, when it unconditionally
accepted after a series of battlefield defeats.
   ``We are still discussing how to fix the cease-fire,'' Hussein
said. ``We want the cease-fire to be fixed so that no spark could
flare up and cause us a problem.''
   He did not indicate whether Baghdad is prepared to soften its
stand in the talks.
   But he stressed: ``We are continuing the way of peace and believe
in it, unless they (the Iranians) attack us. Then, we would mobilize
120 army divisions. But, by God's will, this will not happen.''
   Iraq's military currently has 54 divisions and an estimated 1
million men under arms.
   Tehran claims Iraq occupies 386 square miles of Iranian territory
in the central border sector.
   ``Iran is not short of land, space and free waters,'' INA quoted
Hussein as saying. ``Let each of us live freely in his own homeland,
without interference in internal affairs.''
   His country already is preparing for peace. In Baghdad on Monday,
French Foreign Trade Minister Jean-Marie Rausch conferred with Iraqi
officials on bilateral trade and France's participation in Iraq's
post-war reconstruction, INA reported.
   It said delegates from the Soviet Union, Romania and West Germany
also are in Baghdad discussing cooperation on several industrial
projects.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge declared a mistrial Monday in
a civil suit aimed at assigning blame for the Aeromexico jetliner
disaster two years ago.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon agreed with government
attorneys that jurors were tainted when an attorney for the pilot of
a small plane said the pilot may have died two minutes before the
crash over Cerritos on Aug. 31, 1986. The crash killed 82 people.
   The judge noted that the trial had just begun with opening
statements and no evidence had been presented. Kenyon said he did
not want to take objecting parties``kicking and screaming'' into the
rest of the trial.
   ``I see some prejudice, some very genuine prejudice, to certain
parties,'' Kenyon said, saying the opening statement of an attorney
could ``have had a lasting effect and would be on the mind'' of
jurors.
   U.S. Justice Department lawyer Steven J. Riegel made a mistrial
motion which was denied last week.
   Kenyon said then that trial could continue, but told jurors they
could not consider the heart attack scenario presented by attorneys
for the family of small plane pilot William Kramer.
   But on Monday, Riegel re-introduced his motion and after four
hours of arguments the judge reconsidered and declared the mistrial.
   In the new trial, jurors may not hear anything about an alleged
incapacity or death of Kramer before the accident, Kenyon also
ruled. A pool of 100 prospective jurors will be called Tuesday to
select a new panel.

   Three light earthquakes shook
Northern California Monday, but there were no reports of damage or

   The three quakes appeared to be centered on the San Andreas
Fault, said Pat Jorgenson.
   The first quake struck at 10:58 a.m. and registered 2.4 on the
Richter scale, said Jorgenson. The second was at 11:21 with a 3.0
magnitude and the final one hit at 11:52 a.m., registering 2.75.
   All three were in a location about 30 miles south of San
Francisco.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake.
   A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while
a quake of 6.0 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>PBS Special Questions Second Gunman Theories in JFK Assassination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid a new wave of books, TV specials and
docudramas that have revived the specter of a conspiracy in the John
F. Kennedy assassination, a public television broadcast this week
casts doubt on many of the second gunman theories.
   The JFK segment of the ``Nova'' series, narrated by former CBS
News anchorman Walter Cronkite, used available evidence _ and in
some cases new scientific analyses _ to test theories that a second
gunman shot at Kennedy and that the wounds were altered to hide
evidence of a conspiracy.
   The program, which for the first time gained access to autopsy
photos of the slain president, concludes only that the available
evidence, even when put through modern-day scientific testing, is
inconclusive on whether there was a second gunman.
   The one-hour Public Broadcasting Service special, ``Who Shot
President Kennedy,'' was scheduled to air Tuesday night, one week
before the 25th anniversary of the slaying.
   Producer Robert Richter received permission from the Kennedy
family to show 52 color and black-and-white autopsy photos to four
doctors who were part of the emergency medical team that struggled
to save the president in Dallas.
   Each of the four doctors examined the photos individually behind
closed doors at the National Archives, where evidence from the JFK
assassination is stored. They concluded that the wounds looked the
same as they did when the president arrived at Parkland Memorial
Hospital in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
   The testimony strikes directly at a cornerstone of the second
gunman theory: that Kennedy was shot from the front by a gunman on
the infamous grassy knoll as well as from behind by Lee Harvey
Oswald and that bullet wounds were altered somewhere between Dallas
and the Washington autopsy to make it appear as though entrance
wounds were actually exit wounds.
   Nova received family permission to view the original autopsy
photos only by agreeing not to show them during the broadcast, but
the program does show, for the first time, several graphic autopsy
shots of the slain president. Richter said they were copies obtained
by an outside source whom he declined to identify.
   Richter used a computer model of Dealey Plaza to show how the
much-maligned ``single-bullet theory'' embraced by the Warren
Commission could be correct.
   According to Richter's computer model, a single bullet fired from
the sixth floor of the nearby Texas School Book Depository, where
Oswald was perched, could have traveled through Kennedy's neck, if
he had been bending slightly forward, and go through then-Gov. John
Connally of Texas.
   But the surgeon who operated on Connally in Dallas, interviewed
on the program, doubted that the bullet could have done that damage
and remain nearly intact. The bullet, recovered later at the
hospital, had little damage.
   Nova producers also had a fuzzy photograph, which some say showed
a gunman on the grassy knoll, analyzed by scientists at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Polaroid Corp. The
analysis was inconclusive.
   The program did not explore other theories that say Oswald was
the lone gunman but that he and Jack Ruby, the nightclub owner who
shot Oswald, were part of an organized crime or Cuban plot to kill
the president.
   Cronkite said additional tests on the bullet could be helpful to
formulate a more conclusive opinion.

<HEAD>Heavy Water Exports To Be Outlawed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway is moving to outlaw exports of heavy
water as evidence mounts that material sold for peaceful research
has been diverted to make nuclear weapons.
   Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg has told parliament he was
drafting a bill to halt the sales, charging that other countries had
failed to control how the water was used.
   ``Our experience from the concrete events now being pursued shows
that control systems in some countries are being circumvented
without those responsible facing punishment,'' Stoltenberg said
Thursday.
   Allegations that Norway had an unwitting role in producing
nuclear weaponry proved embarrassing for a nation known as the
distributor of the Nobel Peace Prize.
   A Norwegian TV documentary last month said as much as two-thirds
of the heavy water Norway has sold may have been used in reactors
for weapons production.
   The Norsk Hydro A.S. chemical company has been making heavy water
for 50 years as a byproduct of its ammonia fertilizer production. It
has sold 450 tons of the material, which looks like ordinary water,
to 38 countries.
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used as a coolant in nuclear
reactors. But it also can be used to enable reactors to run on
natural uranium rather than enriched uranium fuel, and to convert it
into plutonium for possible use in nuclear weapons.
   A law banning exports would be mostly a symbolic gesture, since
Norsk Hydro has reduced its output of heavy water from a peak of 20
tons annually to less than two.
   The government has been under fire for losing track of its
shipments at least three times and failing to ensure that it was
used for peaceful purposes.
   Norway sold 15 tons to a West Germany company in 1983, but it
never arrived at its stated destination. The Norwegians traced it to
Basel, Switzerland, then lost it.
   Last week investigators confirmed the shipment was flown to
Bombay, where India has a nuclear facility. It apparently had
arrived at the same time as a Soviet shipment, making it difficult
to find, state prosecutors said.
   Norway refuses to sell to India, which exploded its first nuclear
device in 1974, because it refuses to sign the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
   In 1986 Romania received a shipment of 12{ tons which, according
to Norwegian press reports, was later sent to Israel. Romania is the
only Soviet bloc country with full diplomatic ties with Jerusalem.
   In 1959 Norway sold 20 tons to Israel for research at a reactor
it was then building in Dimona. It received an additional ton in
1970.
   Claims by a former Dimona technician in 1986 that nuclear
explosives were being produced at the desert facility prompted
Norway to demand its contractual right to inspect its goods. Israel
refused to open the Dimona plant to outsiders.
   The technician, Mordechai Vanunu, told a London newspaper that
Israel had stockpiled up to 100 warheads, which would make it the
sixth-largest nuclear power in the world. Vanunu was sentenced to 18
years in prison on treason charges for his disclosures.
   After months of negotiation, Israel and Norway initialed an
agreement under which the Norwegians would be allowed to inspect the
nine tons which remain.
   But some critics have suggested the agreement was an empty
gesture, even if Norway could determine whether its heavy water had
been used to manufacture bombs.
   ``After all, we cannot sent troops to Israel to get the water
back,'' said Kaare Willoch, chairman of parliament's foreign
relations committee.

   The seven bodies unearthed from shallow
graves around Dorothea Montalvo Puente's neatly kept Victorian
rooming house haven't been identified, but detectives have a good
idea who they may be.
   Puente, 59, was known to open her eight-bedroom home on a
tree-lined street a half-mile from the Capitol to retirees, the
homeless, the physically or mentally disabled and others on limited
incomes.
   She was described as a shy and kindly widow, willing to take the
needy into her big house filled with candles and statues of the
Virgin Mary and Jesus.
   Puente took street people, transients, elderly and disabled
people, cleaned them up, fed them and appeared to give them loving
care, said Peggy Nickerson, a social worker who sent 19 people there
over two years.
   Nickerson also encouraged churches to give Puente money to help
her in her good work at Christmas.
   Most of the boarders, according to neighbors, were older men,
some with mental disabilities.
   Puente also arranged to have herself designated as payee on the
disability checks of at least one of her now-missing boarders,
authorities say. She is suspected of collecting welfare or
disability benefits for other boarders as well.
   Nickerson said she stopped sending clients to Puente about three
months ago, after she heard Puente verbally abusing one boarder.
   Nickerson said it isn't unusual for the transient clients she
works with to move on without leaving word, and she was not
suspicious initially when boarders she had placed in Puente's home
vanished.
   But it was Nickerson's call to police, plus a neighbor's
independent report about a different missing person, that brought
detectives to the house Friday.
   By Monday afternoon, seven bodies had been discovered. Most
appear to have been buried for several months, and none of have been
positively identified yet.
   ``We may have to search for dental records, medical records and
other things to find out who these people are,'' police Lt. Joe
Enloe said.
   To help, Nickerson has provided the names of her missing clients,
and Peter D'Anna, district manager of the Social Security
Administration, said his staff would search records to see if
recipients had lived at the house or had signed benefits over to
Puente.
   Nickerson and D'Anna said it is not uncommon for persons such as
the kind of boarders in Puente's home to have welfare, Social
Security or disability checks cashed for them by another party.
   No charges have been filed against Puente, but an arrest warrant
for investigation of murder has been issued for her. Her whereabouts
are unknown.

   A college student who gave birth in her
dormitory and apparently tossed the infant down a garbage chute was
charged Monday with first-degree murder.
   Barbara Trapp, 23, a junior at Tennessee State University,
surrendered to police and was being held without bond, said police
Sgt. Anita Lowrance. A preliminary hearing was set for Wednesday.
   The 6-pound, 3-ounce infant was found Nov. 6 by campus security
guards at Hale Hall, where Ms. Trapp lived in a third-floor room.
The boy was taken to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where
he was in critical condition for six days.
   An autopsy determined the infant died from injuries caused by a
blow to the head, Medical Examiner Charles Harlan said.

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle announced
Monday he intends to resign his Senate seat in time to give his
successor a jump in seniority over the new class of lawmakers being
sworn in Jan. 3..
   Quayle said he had ``no recommendations'' to make on a successor
when he met privately with Indiana Gov. Robert Orr, who will make
the appointment. ``I evaluated everyone from top to bottom,'' he
told reporters afterward.
   Orr, a Republican, stressed that the decision would be his to
make, and said he and Quayle ``talked about a whole lot of people.
That's confidential.''
   The list of possible successors includes Rep. Dan Coats, a former
aide to Quayle who holds the House seat once occupied by Quayle;
Indiana House Speaker Dan Paul Mannweiler and Mitchell Daniels, a
former White House political director with close ties to Sen.
Richard Lugar.
   Other names mentioned include Marion County prosecutor Steve
Goldsmith; Lt. Gov. John Mutz, who was defeated in the election for
governor last week, and Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut.
   Others whose names have cropped up include former Indiana
Secretary of State Edwin Simcox, one-time Environmental Protection
Administration chief William Ruckelshaus and Rep. Dan Burton.
   Quayle's wife, Marilyn, has passed up several opportunities to
say whether reports of her interest in the seat are true, although
the vice president-elect told reporters that she intends to issue a
statement shortly.
   Speculation on a new Indiana senator picked up Monday as
President-elect George Bush said in Florida that he had ``no
specifics yet'' on the duties Quayle will hold in the new
administration.
   Bush said his campaign pledge that Quayle will head a space
council stands. But he said his wish to have Quayle serve as drug
czar has been complicated by legislation requiring that the head of
the program not hold any other position in the government.
   Officials also announced that Quayle would sit on on Tuesday when
Bush meets with visiting West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Quayle issued a statement about his Senate seat after his meeting
with Orr, whose appointee will serve until a special election in
November 1990.
   In a brief statement, Quayle seemed to raise the possibility that
Orr would designate a new senator before the post became officially
vacant. Privately, some Republicans with ties to the state have said
they expect an appointment well before the end of the year.
   Orr is expected to meet within the next several days to discuss
the Senate seat with Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, Indiana's senior
senator.
   In a brief statement, Quayle said he told Orr he intends to
resign his seat before Jan. 3, the date incoming senators are sworn
in for the 101st Congress. A new senator sworn in before that date
would have an advantage over other newcomers when it came to
parceling out the perquisites of office.
   It also could translate to better committee assignments and in
time, a larger staff.
   Quayle's statement said the effective day of his Senate
resignation ``would probably be Jan. 1st or 2nd. Should Governor Orr
name someone to fill the Senate seat prior to the first of the year,
the vice president-elect has pledged that he and his Senate staff
will work with the appointee to make the transition a smooth one.''

   The likely chairman next year of the House
Banking Committee said Monday he will ask the Treasury secretary and
chairman of the Federal Reserve to push for a $50 billion loan to
the agency that rescues insolvent savings institutions.
   Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, told the National Association of
Mortgage Brokers that his first priority as chairman would be the
savings and loan crisis.
   Gonzalez is the senior member of the committee and has the
backing of House leaders to take over from the current chairman,
Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., who lost his bid for a 15th
House term.
   He told the mortgage brokers that he has asked to meet with
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to present the plan, and would
also seek a meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Under the proposal, the Treasury would open a $50 billion line of
credit to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Money from
the sale of loans and repossessed property from the failed S&Ls
could then be funneled back to the Treasury.
   Gonzalez said his recommendation could be accomplished with
little or no legislation. He acknowledged that the administration
has resisted any use of taxpayer funds in the crisis, but, he said
it might be more receptive now, after the presidential election.
   ``Nobody wanted much to rock the boat before the election,'' he
said.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures commercial
banks but has been tracking S&L losses, estimates it will cost $65
billion to clean up the S&L mess. The most recent figures, for the
second quarter of this year, show that the problem is growing by $15
billion a year, FDIC spokesman Alan J. Whitney said Monday.
   ``The FSLIC, it's broke. ... There's no other way to put it,''
Gonzalez said. ``... Nobody wants a taxpayer bailout ... but there
are limits to what the industry can do and they've reached those
limits.''
   Later, speaking with reporters, he said, ``If it ever gets around
that there's nothing insuring those accounts and deposits, you could
have chaos.''
   After insolvent S&Ls are closed, Gonzalez said he would preserve
the conventional S&L system, aided by a National Housing Trust to
stabilize mortgage interest rates.
   ``We've got to save some semblance of the system,'' he said.
   He criticized the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's policy of
keeping failed S&Ls open after merger with another institition and a
thin infusion of capital from private investors.
   ``They stitch these dead corpses together. All that does is make
a bigger stinking corpse,'' Gonzalez said.

<TEXT>
   A former Miskito Indian rebel
leader accused the leftist government of reneging on a peace pact,
and refused to rule out a return to battle unless the Sandinistas
make good on their promises.
   ``I haven't received the promised political, moral or economic
support,'' Uriel Vanegas, 24, said in a weekend interview in this
Atlantic coast city.
   Slightly more than a year ago, Vanegas and 400 of his troops
ended their more than 7-year-old war against the Sandinista
government with an agreement that allowed the rebels to return to
civilian life but keep their U.S.-supplied arms.
   The war along the isolated, so-called Miskito Coast virtually
ended with Vanegas' decision to stop fighting. Since then the
Sandinistas, under the direction of Interior Minister Tomas Borge,
have signed similar pacts with other Miskito, Sumo and Rama Indian
groups.
   ``My decision was for the best,'' Vanegas said, shortly before
meeting with Borge to discuss the agreement's progress.
   But he charged that the government has sought to disarm and
harass his troops, failed to provide them with enough economic
support, and barred them from holding political meetings.
   ``I can't visit the (Indian) communities. They (the Sandinistas)
are afraid I'll have contact with the Contras,'' he said, referring
to the main U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebel group. ``There is a lot of
mistrust.''
   Vanegas said that about 100 of his men had returned to the
battlefield during the past year.
   He said the Contras also have banned him from going to some
remote villages.
   ``They say we surrendered and consider us the enemies. They won't
let us come into their territory. We're caught in the middle,''
Vanegas said.
   The Indian groups received some of the millions of dollars that
the Reagan administration gave the Contras, but most of the money
went to rebels operating out of Honduras on the northern front and,
to a lesser extent, the southern front along the Costa Rican border.
   The Sandinistas and the non-Indian Contra leaders signed a
cease-fire agreement in March. The sides have failed to agree to a
permanent truce but most of the fighting has stopped.
   ``The war won't help the poor,'' Vanegas said. ``The war enriches
those who have the arms and those who make the arms. The Miskitos
could begin a war much stronger, or there could be a lasting peace.
That depends on the policies of the government.''
   Asked if this meant he would again take up arms, he said, ``Yes,
we will fight, go to war, it's up to the government.''
   Borge, on a trip to the Atlantic Coast, held three closed-door
sessions during the weekend with Vanegas and leaders of other groups
that gave up the fight.
   Borge said later that Vanegas aired his complaints and had
indicated ``quite the opposite'' from intending to return to war.
   Several of the Indians asked Borge for more government money, a
request not easily filled in this financially devastated nation. The
economy suffered a severe blow when Hurricane Joan struck Nicaragua
last month and ravaged the southern Atlantic coastal city of
Bluefields.

<HEAD>Kennedy Declares Liberalism `Alive and Well' in Election Aftermath</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis would have won the 1988
presidential election if he had followed John F. Kennedy's example
and embraced the term ``liberal'' early in his campaign, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy said Monday.
   Speaking at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, the
56-year-old Democrat maintained that ``the liberal tradition of the
Democratic Party is alive and well and strong in America'' and
``this election was eminently winnable.''
   About 250 students and faculty members jammed a lecture hall for
the speech, one of a weeklong series of events commemorating the
25th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination on Nov. 22,
1963.
   ``I know how my brother would have ridiculed the Republican
attempts in the recent election campaign to make `liberal' a dirty
word. They tried that trick in the 1960 election, too, and my
brother rejected it out of hand,'' Kennedy said.
   ``He embraced the liberal label without hesitation. He didn't run
away from it, he welcomed it, and he campaigned proudly under its
banner.
   ``And I believe that if he had started campaigning that way a few
weeks earlier, Mike Dukakis and not George Bush would be taking the
oath of office next January as the next president of the United
States.''
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential
nominee, initially took a defensive posture toward Republican
assertions that he was a liberal whose views were ``out of the
mainstream.'' He did not call himself a liberal until the final two
weeks of the campaign.
   Far from being out of the mainstream, Kennedy said, the current
liberal positions on issues like day care, parental leaves, national
health insurance, education and the minimum wage have received broad
support in opinion polls.
   ``I believe when the economic issues are level, this country is
basically for the Democratic agenda,'' he said.
   Twenty years ago, Kennedy added, liberals had to deal with ``very
tough questions'' like busing for racial integration, withdrawal
from Vietnam and the trade-off between jobs and environmental
protection.
   By contrast, he said, the current agenda consists mainly of
family issues which are supported by 80 percent of the public.
   The six-term senator also contended that the need to reduce the
federal budget deficit may boost support for the Democratic position
on defense.
   ``I think you'll see a dramatic change, hopefully, in terms of
Americans' understanding of defense issues. ... In the past, the
people who wanted to stop (weapon systems) were always accused of
being weak on defense. Now that debate hopefully will change,'' he
said.
   Asked by a student if Jack Kennedy would have withdrawn U.S.
forces from Vietnam if he had not been assassinated, the senator at
first said that ``it's not worthwhile to speculate on it ... in
terms of fairness to those that succeeded him.''
   But, he added, ``My own sense is, we would have found a way out.''
   Kennedy said he believed George Bush was ``not as ideological''
as Ronald Reagan and would work with the Democratic majority in
Congress on issues like education.
   Adopting a conciliatory tone in an otherwise partisan speech,
Kennedy congratulated Bush on being the first sitting vice president
since Martin Van Buren in 1836 to win election to the presidency.
   ``I'll just point out, though, that Martin Van Buren turned out
to be a one-term president,'' he said.

   Associates of a former administrator of a
group home for the retarded had feared that he might seek revenge
for his dismissal, but didn't anticipate the violent reaction that
left two people dead.
   ``People thought there would be some attempt to hurt people, but
not physically. Most people thought he would sue,'' said Peter
Kowalski, executive director of John F. Murphy Homes, the non-profit
organization that took over the group home in Mechanic Falls after
it emerged from bankruptcy.
   Authorities said Alan Matterson, embittered by being fired 18
months ago for mismanagement, went on a 3{-hour rampage that started
late Saturday in New Hampshire and ended early Sunday when he killed
himself with a shot in the head while fleeing police in Maine.
   Also killed was a state official whose duties involved regulation
of community care facilities. And three people were wounded: another
state official, a former bookkeeper for the Mechanic Falls home and
the bookkeeper's sister-in-law.
   The shootings, which began Saturday night in Milton Mills, N.H.,
came on the eve of an open house marking the dedication of Main
Street Mechanic Falls, as the group home for 14 retarded people is
now known.
   Kowalski said Monday that advertisements for Sunday's open house
had appeared in local newspapers and it was likely that Matterson,
36, of Cumberland, was aware of the event.
   ``That may have been the straw that broke the camel's back,''
said Janet Tillson, a nursing supervisor who became interim director
of the group home after Matterson's dismissal.
   ``I don't know whether it was coincidence or whether it was one
of the events that might have caused him to crack. That may be one
of the questions we never know the answer to,'' State Police
spokesman Steve McCausland said.
   The shootings took place at the victims' homes, spread over a
distance of 75 miles, as part of a methodically executed plan
apparently motivated by a desire for vengeance, McCausland said.
   Matterson was armed with a pair of .44-caliber revolvers and had
80 rounds of ammunition in his car, said Detective Timothy Culbert.
Investigators didn't know where he was headed when a Gardiner police
officer spotted his car and gave chase, but Culbert said he may have
been stalking other state officials he felt were reponsible for
destroying his career.
   ``He didn't have a list per se. He didn't have anything written
down,'' Culbert said.
   Details about Matterson's activities over the past year were
sketchy, although authorities said he had been living with his
parents in Cumberland at the time of the shootings. The parents
could not be reached for comment; their telephone number is unlisted.
   State officials and former associates said Matterson was a poor
administrator who was forced to relinquish previous jobs because of
his poor management skills.
   Kowalski said Matterson was regarded by employees at the Mechanic
Falls home as ``very, very introverted, a loner who did not
associate with the people around him.''
   Culbert said Matterson's life had come apart under the strain of
his dismissal and the prospect that he would no longer be able to
find a job in the field in which he had been trained.
   ``This was his whole life, to run a nursing home or a mental
retardation center. He had the certification and the schooling,''
Culbert said. ``When they took it away from him, they took away
everything.''

<HEAD>Memorial Tribute to Career of Broadway and Film Director</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a memorial by turns lighthearted, sentimental
and poignant, colleagues and admirers recalled Monday the career of
Joshua Logan, who directed, produced or wrote some of America's most
honored plays and films.
   ``He was among the greats of the American theater,'' President
Reagan said in a message from the White House, mentioning among
Logan's achievements ``South Pacific,'' ``Mister Roberts,'' ``and my
own favorite, `This is the Army.'''
   Reagan had a role in a movie version of that one, a 1942 G.I.
show. ``And it took him right to the White House, as you all
remember,'' wisecracked Arlene Francis, who read the president's
tribute from the stage of the Shubert Theater, where ``Celebrating
Josh'' played for an audience of about 1,000.
   Logan died in New York on July 12 at age 79.
   James Stewart, a classmate of Logan's at Princeton in the late
1920s, said, ``I will always be grateful with all my heart to Josh
because he gave me my acting career.''
   Stewart said it all came about in a few minutes, after receiving
his degree in architecture with every intention of returning for
graduate work, but letting Logan sweet-talk him into spending the
summer with the University Players.
   ``I said fine and I've been an actor ever since,'' said Stewart.
   Joanne Woodward said her life was changed when Logan hired her in
1952 to understudy Kim Stanley and Janice Rule in the Broadway
production of ``Picnic,'' during which ``I learned more about acting
that one time than the rest of my life.'' She also met Paul Newman,
her husband, who had a small role and understudied the lead.
   In a film clip that opened the tribute, Logan called himself
``one of the world's luckiest men.''
   ``I was lucky enough to be born at the right time so that I could
work with the greatest composers and lyricists and book writers, in
the golden age of American musical comedy ... golden because you
could understand the words of the lyrics and when you understood
them they were worth understanding.''

   Black leaders said they were
disappointed Monday after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review a
lawsuit filed over the composition of the Leon County Commission.
   ``It would have been a precedent-setting case,'' said Henry
Lewis, a pharmacology professor and the county's first and only
black commissioner.
   Even though Lewis said the current system _ revised since the
original lawsuit was filed _ worked, he noted that reapportionment
was coming up in four years and there was a danger that blacks could
be short-changed.
   Anita Davis, president of the Tallahassee branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, also said Monday
that, currently ``the good outweighs the bad.''
   In 1983, when the NAACP sued, Leon County's five commissioners
were elected at-large. The lawsuit contended that system illegally
diluted the voting strength of black residents, who comprised 25
percent of the population of Leon County, which is Tallahassee and
the surrounding area.
   The plaintiffs urged that the commission consist of five members,
each elected from a district.
   When the commissioners revamped the system in 1986, however, it
adopted a plan that provides for five commissioners from districts
and two at-large.
   ``So we got part of what we wanted ... and it seems to be fair,''
Davis said Monday.
   But the NAACP argued that the plan lacked the status of a
legislative enactment, in part because it was not approved by
referendum. It said Florida law required such county reapportionment
plans to be approved by the voters.
   ``The thing is the county should have at least offered the
opportunity for the electorate to decide ... but they did not,''
Davis said. ``They just took it upon themselves.''
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the current plan,
and on Monday, the Supreme Court, with one dissenting vote, left
that ruling intact. The votes of at least four justices are required
to grand such review, and only Justice Harry A. Blackum voted to
hear arguments in the case.
   The appeals court said the plan adopted by the board of
commissioners was ``legislatively enacted,'' in effect similar to
one approved by a state Legislature.
   ``A broad definition of `legislatively enacted' leaves
reapportionment to be performed by a legislative body of the state
rather than the federal judiciary,'' the appeals court said.
   Davis said she did not know if the NAACP would pursue the matter.
   The new plan led to election in November 1986 of six whites and
one black. Commissioners generally serve for four years, although
some members are serving two-year terms.
   Gayle Nelson, a commissioner since 1978, said she was relieved
the legal action was finished. ``I think that any time you have a
lawsuit behind you you're always glad,'' she said.
   ``I think it's the best of both worlds,'' she said in defense of
the current system.

   A federal prosecutor applauded a ruling Monday by
the U.S. Supreme Court that ex-Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos
and his wife must surrender banking records to the grand jury which
indicted them on charges they stole millions from their country's
treasury.
   ``It definitely is a victory,'' said Viktor Pohorelsky of the
U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan. ``It means we're going to get
what we wanted all along.''
   The Marcoses also must turn over fingerprints, palm prints, voice
prints and handwriting samples, but their attorney, John Tigue, said
the order to provide financial records from foreign banks was the
most important facet of the ruling. The couple faced jail or a fine
if they did not comply.
   ``We will have to comply, and we will do it forthwith,'' Tigue
said. ``We will do it at a date that is convenient for all.''
   FBI assistant special agent-in-charge Ralph Girardi said the
Marcoses would appear at Honolulu headquarters Friday afternoon to
provide the samples. The process should take about two hours, he
said.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said the couple had no comment on
the ruling.
   The court's rejection of an emergency request by the former
Philippine president and first lady reversed an order issued Nov. 8
by Justice Thurgood Marshall.
   Marshall temporarily excused the couple from complying with the
grand jury subpoenas to give the full U.S. Supreme Court a chance to
review the case.
   The records and samples were sought by a federal grand jury in
New York which previously indicted the Marcoses and eight others on
racketeering charges. The panel is conducting further investigations.
   U.S. District Judge John M. Walker ruled Aug. 11 that the
Marcoses no longer held immunity as ruler and first lady of a
foreign country and must comply with the subpoenas. The 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling on Oct. 19.
   The Marcoses have been indicted on racketeering charges for
allegedly plundering $103 million from the Philippine treasury,
funneling it to foreign bank accounts and using the money to buy
prime New York City real estate and art.
   Eight others, including Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi,
also were indicted but remain at large outside the United States.
   Marcos, 71, and his wife, 59, have lived in exile in Hawaii since
he was ousted in a popular uprising in 1986. The samples will be
provided by the couple in Hawaii, Tigue said.
   Mrs. Marcos, who has pleaded innocent to the racketeering
charges, is free on $5 million bail that was put up by tobacco
heiress Doris Duke.
   Marcos' arraignment was postponed pending a report by a
government physician who examined him.
   The case is Marcos vs. U.S., A-361.

   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., met with state
political leaders and space agency and defense officials on Monday
to coordinate efforts to funnel enough federal contracts to Avtex
Fibers Inc. to keep its Front Royal, Va., rayon plant operating.
   Avtex Fibers, the sole supplier of rayon fibers used in the space
shuttle and several military missiles, was shut down for several
days this month, idling 1,300 employees. Avtex Chairman John N.
Gregg complained of foreign competition and stiff environmental
regulations.
   The plant resumed operations last Thursday after the company said
it had negotiated a long-term contract with several aerospace
companies.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration reportedly
arranged a $7 million contract last week for Avtex with the promise
of additional contracts if Avtex raised $20 million by this Friday
to remain open.
   Warner, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said
after Monday's meeting that NASA and the Defense Department are
cooperating in trying to arrange enough contracts to solve Avtex's
short-term cash flow problem. Avtex reportedly says it needs a total
of $45 million to keep operating.
   The senator said that within the next couple of days, he will
hold another meeting with Avtex executives, the U.S. and Virginia
attorneys general and representatives of federal and state
environmental agencies to discuss claims against the Front Royal
plant for past safety and pollution violations.
   Warner said some agreement must be reached that would allow Avtex
to receive government contract payments without the threat that
federal money would be diverted to pay off environmental and safety
claims.
   Virginia Attorney General Mary Sue Terry filed a $20 million suit
against Avtex of Nov. 2, alleging nearly 2,000 water pollution
violations over the last eight years at the Front Royal plant, about
60 miles west of Washington, D.C.
   ``The good news is that people are looking at this thing with the
idea of `let's make it work,''' Warner said. He said the rayon
fibers produced by Avtex were ``essential to our national security
and the U.S. space program.''
   Warner said he is trying to arrangement appointment of a single
federal official to represent such agencies as NASA, the Pentagon,
the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, and a similar official to represent state
interests, in negotiations over the plant.
   Attending Monday's meeting with Warner were officials of NASA and
the Pentagon plus Gov. Gerald Baliles, Sen. Paul Trible, R-Va., and
his successor, Sen.-elect Charles Robb, and Rep. D. French Slaughter
Jr., R-Va.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Rights Violations Increase In El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights violations have risen sharply
this year in El Salvador, where both the government and guerrillas
are to blame for an increase in bloodshed, a U.N. report said Monday.
   The report, which echoes a similar accusations made by Amnesty
International last week, said death squads linked to the military
have stepped up their violent tactics in 1988.
   ``An alarming number of politically motivated summary executions,
including mass executions, have been carried out by members of the
state apparatus, particularly the armed forces,'' said the U.N.
report.
   But it also said leftist guerrillas have persisted in
assassinating people who collaborate with the armed forces.
   It said guerrilla groups have ``revived the equally disturbing
practice of indiscriminate urban terrorism, which seriously
endangers the lives and physical integrity of civilians.''
   It said that the rebels' ``continuing systematic attacks on the
country's economic infrastructure also seriously undermine the
present and future enjoyment by Salvadoran citizens of important
economic, social and cultural rights.''
   Meanwhile, Guillermo Ungo, an opposition candidate for president,
told a news conference here Monday that there is ``no chance to have
a fair election when the army controls the main political
structure.''
   Ungo is the presidential candidate of the Democratic Convergence,
a coalition of three leftist parties.
   He also is president of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, which
is allied with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
umbrella organization of five guerrilla groups fighting the
U.S.-backed government.
   ``In El Salvador, as in Chile, just because there are elections,
doesn't mean there is democracy,'' Ungo said in English.
   He said he agreed with some aspects of the U.N. human rights
report, but said it did not adequately recognize the problems of war
and that both sides, not only the rebels, use mines and grenades.
   The increased activity of death squads comes at a time when
President Jose Napoleon Duarte is suffering from cancer and leftist
leaders are re-entering the country after guerrillas agreed to let
their political wings participate in a March 1989 presidential
election.
   Duarte, a centrist who has vigorously opposed the death squads,
is not a candidate in the election.
   The U.N. report was prepared by Jose Antonio Pastor Ridruejo,
special representative of the Commission on Human Rights, which
requested an investigation.Ridruejo visited the El Salvador Oct.
9-15.
   The report said that armed forces occasionally kill and injure
civilians, but that guerrillas ``continue to cause more civilian
deaths and injuries than the army, as a result of the explosion of
contact mines (and) ... guerrilla fire.''
   In Washington, Amnesty International USA also noted what it said
was ``an alarming resurgence of death squad activity'' in the
country.
   It said an average of 12 ``death squad-style'' killings per month
occurred in El Salvador in 1987 and said that figure tripled during
the first half of 1988, according to estimates by the Roman Catholic
Church.
   More than 60,000 people have died during the 9-year-old war
between the leftist rebels and the government.

   OPEC oil ministers begin a series of
crucial meetings this week designed to impose greater discipline on
the cartel and end the persistent weakness in world crude prices.
   However, industry analysts held out little expectation OPEC would
reach agreement, a sentiment echoed by U.S. oil company executives
gathered Monday at the annual meeting of the American Petroleum
Institute in New York.
   ``It might take more than one or two meetings to achieve'' higher
prices by limiting production, said Richard M. Morrow, chairman of
Amoco Corp.
   The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
under intense pressure to come up with a new production agreement to
regain some control over the chaotic market.
   ``The alternative is for the conference to collapse in a heap,''
said London oil consultant Paul McDonald.
   Two of the cartel's committees plan joint discussions starting
Thursday in Vienna, Austria. All 13 ministers are scheduled to meet
next Monday for their regular winter meeting.
   Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have turned up their
production levels in recent months as they compete for market
position in advance of the meetings.
   The increased output has added more crude to an already glutted
market, pushing prices $4 or more below OPEC's benchmark price of
$18 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Each $1 drop in the price of crude oil theoretically means a fall
of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices. However, U.S. oil
companies have not passed on to consumers the current price decline
partly because of the tight supplies of gasoline coupled with high
demand.
   If the OPEC ministers succeeded in putting together a new
production package, oil prices should rise some in the coming
months, analysts said.
   Failure, they said, could send prices into a nosedive.
   ``If they come up with a convincing system, we could see prices
go up a couple of dollars,'' said David Gray, an oil analyst at the
London investment firm of James Capel and Co. If not, ``prices could
be below $10 quite quickly.''
   Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute,
the main trade group for the U.S. oil business, said, ``I am
optimistic that they will reach an agreement; the question is how
soon.''
   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that OPEC production soared to almost 21.1 million
barrels a day in October, the highest monthly output for more than
five years.
   The cartel's current production quotas, stemming from a December
1986 arrangement, are intended to limit total output to about 15
million barrels a day. That excludes Iraq, which ignored its quota.
   Several OPEC members have recommended that the cartel boost its
output ceiling to 17.4 million barrels, which would still require a
sharp overall cutback by the cartel.
   The Vienna meeting's goals are to try to come up with new quotas,
bring Iraq back into the system and stop the cheating by the
cartel's members.

<TEXT>
   Antal Dorati, the noted Hungarian-born
composer and conductor, died Sunday at his home at Gerzensee, near
Bern, his wife said Monday. He was 82.
   Ilsa Dorati would reveal no further details about her husband's
death, and the cause of death was not immediately known.
   A student of Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly, Dorati led orchestras
in Budapest, Dresden and Monaco before World War II. He then
migrated to the United States via Australia and became a naturalized
American citizen in 1947.
   In 1945 he was named to head the Dallas Symphony and in 1949
succeeded Dimitri Mitropoulos as head conductor of the Minneapolis
Symphony. Dorati returned to Europe in the 1960s and settled in
Switzerland, continuing to work as conductor.
   Born in Budapest on April 9, 1906, Dorati was educated at the
Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest and at the University of
Vienna.
   He was music director of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from
1933 to 1939 and his conducting posts included Budapest's Royal
Opera and the Ballet Theater of New York. He was principal conductor
of the British Broadcasting Corp. Symphony Orchestra from 1962 to
1966 and of the Stockholm Philharmonic from 1966-74.
   Dorati was music director of the Washington National Symphony
Orchestra from 1970 to 1977, principal conductor of Britain's Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra from 1975-78, and remained as conductor
laureate thereafter. He was music director of the Detroit Symphony
from 1977 to 1981.
   Dorati made more than 500 symphonic recordings and won 29 Grand
Prix du Disque among many recording awards.
   His compositions included chamber music, concertos and suites for
strings and oboe, and a symphonic song cycle called ``The Voices.''

<HEAD>Major Fire Said To Disrupt Cuban Phone Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A telephone service fire in Havana over the
weekend shut down Cuba's overseas phone and telegraph lines, the
State Department said Monday.
   ``We have no estimate when service will resume,'' Ben Justesen, a
department press officer, said. ``We don't have any informatin on
the cause of the fire at all.''
   The Justesen said the damage prevented telephone contact between
the department and the U.S. interests section in Havana, which is
part of the Swiss embassy.
   ``We have no information on the fire's effect on domestic Cuban
service,'' he said.
   Earlier this year, the U.S. Departments of Treasury and Commerce
authorized licenses for the use of American equipment to replace an
international telephone cable in Cuba.
   The project was not intended to improve domestic service.
   Some employees of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. were
believed to be headed for Cuba to do some of the work, or may
actually have reached the country. However the fire was not related
to the project, Justesen said.

<HEAD>Snowstorm In West, Headed For Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm spread heavy snow Monday in the mountains of the West,
with generous rain at lower altitudes, and the snow was expected to
move to the northern Plains.
   The first heavy snowfall of the season occurred in the Sierra
Nevada near Lake Tahoe. Accumulations ranged from 6 to 8 inches
around lake level to around 2 feet at higher elevations. Donner
Summit, Calif., had 23 inches by morning and Echo Summit, Calif.,
had 18 inches.
   Idaho also got substantial snow. Bald Mountain got 22 inches of
snow with 13 inches on the valley below, and Sun Valley got 9 inches
with 11 inches on surrounding mountain tops.
   Winter storm warnings were posted for parts of Montana, Wyoming,
Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Winter storm watches were posted
into Tuesday for western South Dakota.
   Up to 6 inches of snow fell in the mountains of northern Utah,
and a teen-ager was killed when her car went out of control on ice
and snow and careened into an empty school bus.
   Ahead of the storm, rain was reported in northeastern South
Dakota, with snow falling in southwestern North Dakota.
   Generous rain fell across parts of central and eastern
California. Two 2 inches was measured from Sunday morning into
Monday morning below 5,000 feet near Blue Canyon, and 1.3 inches at
Shelter Cove along the northwest coast.
   Up to an inch of rain fell in the Los Angeles area early Monday,
and a pregnant woman and her unborn child were killed in one of the
many highway pileups attributed in part to wet pavement.
   There were scattered power outages in California, and about 3,000
Bakersfield High School students were given the day off because of a
lingering blackout.
   Around the storm, wind gusted to 55 mph at Casper, Wyo., and to
53 mph at Laramie, Wyo. Wind gusted to 40 mph over the mountain and
desert areas of southern California.
   Elsewhere, widely scattered showers developed during the morning
along the central Gulf Coast.
   In sharp contrast to the winterlike weather elsewhere, Galveston,
Texas, reached a record high of 81 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 20
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 90 at Harlingen and McAllen, Texas.
Monday's morning low was 13 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   For Tuesday, the storm in the West was forecast to move from the
central Rockies into the middle Missouri Valley. Widespread snow and
blowing snow were forecast from the Colorado Rockies through the
northern Plains into northern Minnesota. Numerous showers and
thunderstorms were forecast from the middle Mississippi and the
middle and lower Missouri valleys into the southern Plains. Rain was
forecast over the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 20s and 30s were predicted through the northern and
central Rockies into the northern Plains; in the 40s and 50s from
the northern Pacific Coast into the Great Basin of Nevada and
western Utah, and the southern Rockies, and from the Great Lakes
into the mid Atlantic states and New England; in the 60s from the
central California coast into the desert Southwest; in the 60s or
70s across much of the nation east of the Mississippi River and
south of the mid Atlantic states; in the 70s over southeastern
Kansas and southern Missouri into Oklahoma and Arkansas; in the 80s
from the central Gulf Coast into Florida; and from the mid 80s to
lower 90s over central and eastern Texas into the lower Rio Grande
Valley.

   President-elect George Bush tried to soothe
jitters on financial markets Monday by promising quick action on the
budget deficit, while his advisers signaled an early appointment of
an economics team expected to be led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady.
   Bush, meanwhile, fueled speculation about his White House
appointments by inviting New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu to dinner at
a vacation retreat in Florida. Sununu is considered a leading
candidate to be chief of staff. So is Craig Fuller, chief of staff
in Bush's vice presidential office.
   As Bush relaxed at the Gulf Stream home of millionaire friend
William Stamps Farish III, his aides said the vice president planned
to consider candidates this week for senior Cabinet posts. A list of
three to five names was being drawn up for each post, the aides said.
   Bush will return to Washington on Tuesday. He is expected to
announce that Brady, a longtime adviser and friend, will remain as
treasury secretary after Jan. 20, when the Bush administration
begins.
   Leaders of Bush's transition team said the president-elect wants
to consider four or five senior Cabinet choices this week. They said
he especially wants to assemble his economic team rapidly, which
also is likely to include former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard
Darman as budget chief, and Stanford University professor Michael J.
Boskin as chief White House economic adviser.
   ``I think that the economic team, under any circumstance, would
be one you'd want to pay attention to early on,'' said Robert
Teeter, a co-director of the transition with Fuller.
   Bush's words of assurance about the deficit seemed to have some
effect. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks, which had
lost almost 80 points since Bush's election, including a 47-point
drop Friday, steadied and ended the day Monday down only 1.95
points. The dollar also recovered some of its losses.
   Bush has no timetable for making appointments, and will announce
them as decisions are made, Fuller said. Bush already has named
former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III as the new secretary of
state.
   But Bush said Monday he will hold back on ``any special
missions'' involving Baker because he doesn't want to ``pre-empt the
official foreign policy machinery of this administration.''
   Asked specifically about his policy toward Nicaragua, Bush,
speaking to reporters on the beach, said ``Those who are looking for
radical policy shifts won't find them. Now if you're looking for new
initiatives or something of that nature, maybe we'll have something
to say on that. But in terms of reiterating my support for the
freedom fighters, I'm glad to keep on doing that.''
   Bush also did nothing to dampen speculation that the White House
would be run by a power-sharing triumverate of Sununu, Fuller and
Teeter. ``Stay tuned. I'll have announcements on that pretty soon,''
Bush said.
   On his return to Washington, Bush and Vice President-elect Dan
Quayle will meet Tuesday with visiting West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. Bush also is to meet Wednesday with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   Bush said he had not spoken to Quayle since the day before he
came to Florida. Asked what functions Quayle would perform, he said:
``No specifics yet. I had a very good meeting with Sen. Quayle ...
but we didn't get into specific assignments.''
   He said that his campaign pledge that Quayle would head a space
council is ``a given.'' But he said that his wish that Quayle head
the anti-drug war has ``been complicated a little bit by the new
legislation'' calling for the appointment of a full-time drug czar.
``I have to get _ we're getting a good legal opinion ... I must
comply with the law, but I think that a president can have people
report to him any way he wants. But I want to know more about it
before I can go further,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, Quayle said he will resign his Senate seat before Jan.
3 _ probably a day o two earlier. That will allow outgoing Indiana
Gov. Robert Orr to name a Republican replacement before Democratic
Gov.-elect Evan Bayh is sworn in.
   The list of possible Senate successors includes Rep. Dan Coats, a
former aide to Quayle who holds the seat in the House that the vice
president-elect once held; Indiana House Speaker Dan Mannweiler;
county prosecutor Steve Goldsmith; Lt. Gov. John Mutz, who was
defeated last week in a bid to become the state's governor and
Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut. Others whose names have cropped
up include former EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus; Rep. Dan
Burton and Mitchell Daniels, a former White House political director
and former close adviser to Sen. Richard Lugar. Quayle's wife,
Marilyn, also has been mentioned.
   Bush's strategists hope Brady's reappointment will calm turmoil
on world financial markets, where the value of the dollar and stock
prices have skidded because of uncertainty about the economic
policies he will pursue.
   Bush, minimizing market jitters, said, ``these gyrations happen.''
   Bush pledged to follow the Reagan admnistration's policy of
coordinated intervention with U.S. allies in exchange marekets when
major currencies rise or fall too quickly.
   Trying to assure the financial community that he will move
quickly to deal with the huge budget deficit, Bush said, `` I will
address myself to that early on in my presidency ... It is a matter
of great urgency.''
   In Washington, Fuller and Teeter talked by telephone with the
vacationing Bush. Fuller said they were preparing a list of three to
five names for each major appointment he has to make.
   ``The vice president does want to look at a series of names,''
Teeter said. ``He wants to examine some of the criteria and some of
the issues that will be facing each of those departments so that he
can consider people in that context. But he certainly wants to look
at a series of names for each and every job _ he made that clear to
us last week.
   ``There are four or five senior jobs in the Cabinet that are all
being looked at right now and that he is going to want to meet on
and consider this week,'' Teeter said. He said that in most cases,
Bush would want to talk with candidates before picking one.
   Asked about the timing for naming a defense secretary, Teeter
said, ``I don't think it's particularly close.''
   A transition source said that while some people will be appointed
quickly, others will take weeks as they undergo a full FBI
background check that takes two to four weeks.

   A coroner heading an inquest
into the 1982 slayings of three unarmed IRA guerrillas refused
Monday to order testimony from three police officers involved in the
shootings.
   The inquest into the slayings opened Monday before an 11-member
jury sitting in Craigavon, 19 miles southwest of Belfast.
   The jury is to establish the circumstances surrounding the
shooting deaths of Gervase McKerr, Eugene Toman and Sean Burns. The
Irish Republican Army has acknowledged the three as members.
   An hour after the hearing began, a lawyer for the family of
McKerr, 31, walked out in protest when coroner James Elliott refused
to summon three officers to testify.
   Attorney Pat Finnucane said he would ask the Northern Ireland
High Court to order the officers to answer questions at the inquest.
The officers were involved in the shooting but a Belfast court
acquitted them of murder charges.
   Elliott said the officers would present statements but could not
be compelled to testify. Finnucane then left, saying the ruling
allowed the officers ``to have their cake and eat it.'' He said the
McKerr family had instructed him to appeal to the High Court.
   The three IRA men were shot and killed in a police ambush on Nov.
11, 1982, as they drove through County Armagh, a hotbed of guerrilla
activity.
   Three more unarmed Roman Catholics, two of them guerrillas and
one apparently an innocent teen-ager, died in unclear circumstances
in two more police ambushes in County Armagh over the next month.
   The overwhelmingly Catholic IRA is fighting to expell the British
from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the
Irish Republic.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, Britain's top official in
the province, has barred the inquest from investigating certain
circumstances of the shootings which he considers would be
``detrimental to the national security.''
   King's order, signed last week, expressed concern about
jeopardizing present and future counter-terrorist operations.
   A screen, heavily guarded by policemen, concealed the identities
of police officers giving testimony, and up to one dozen officers
will be identified only by letters of the alphabet.
   The first to testify was a detective inspector of the Royal
Ulster Constabulary's intelligence-gathering unit, called E4A.
   The officer, identified only as AK, said that at a briefing on
the morning of the shooting intelligence was given of a planned IRA
attack. He said Burns and Toman were wanted for questioning about
terrorist activity, and that it was thought they were armed.

<HEAD>Thatcher Announces Official Gorbachev Visit to Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev will come to Britain next
month for his first official visit since becoming Soviet leader in
1985, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced Monday.
   Mrs. Thatcher said in her annual address to the Lord Mayor's
banquet in the City of London, the capital's financial district,
that the visit of Gorbachev and his wife Raisa was scheduled for
Dec. 12-14.
   ``I am very pleased to announce tonight that Mr. Gorbachev has
accepted our invitation ... and that he and Mrs. Gorbachev will come
here next month,'' she said, ``We shall give them a very warm
welcome.''
   It will be the fifth meeting of the two leaders. Mrs. Thatcher
issued her invitation during a visit to Moscow in April 1987 and
repeated it last December when Gorbachev stopped here briefly on his
way to a summit with President Reagan.
   The prime minister, departing from her prepared text Monday, paid
tribute to the Soviet president and Communist Party chief but said
Soviet ``vested interests'' would prevent immediate change.
   ``We very much welcome what Mr. Gorbachev is trying to achieve in
the Soviet Union but we shouldn't expect change to come quickly,''
she said of Gorbachev's plans for economic and social reform. ``The
vested interests opposed to it are immensely strong, as Mr.
Gorbachev frequently reminds us.'' After ensuring a strong defense
in the West, Mrs. Thatcher declared, it is important to encourage
change and reform in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``We want to see their countries more prosperous, with their
peoples enjoying a fuller share of life's benefits,'' she said. ``We
must do everything we can to stretch out hands across the divide.''

   Public health officials should take advantage of
upheavals in the nuclear weapons industry to demand a full
accounting of the plants' activities, members of the American Public
Health Association said Monday.
   ``What's happening today is very, very important and is a real
opportunity for change,'' said Anthony Robbins, professor of public
health at Boston University and treasurer for International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.
   ``We must not miss the opportunity to end this ever expanding but
largely hidden public health disaster,'' he said at a news
conference called by the Radioactive Waste Campaign, one of several
events in the APHA's four-day meeting in Boston.
   Concern has grown as the Energy Department has disclosed problems
at some of its nuclear production plants and has wholly or partly
closing down four of its 17 major facilities. Officials have
estimated cleanup will cost $110 billion.
   The three reactors at the Savannah River plant, a nuclear weapons
facility near Aiken, S.C., have been shut down because of safety
problems. DOE officials have said tritium gas has accidentally
leaked from the reactors on several occasions, but they added the
amounts of the gas did not pose a danger to public health.
   The Savannah reactors make tritium and plutonium needed in
nuclear weapons. They will have to be reopened within six months to
ensure a continued supply, said Chris West, a DOE spokesman.
   ``We do not want to operate unsafe reactors or any unsafe
facilities, but on the other hand we've got the crunch,'' West said.
   He said Energy Department experts are evaluating the Savannah
plant and hope to have it restarted by December, although that date
is tentative.
   ``The bottom line is that this country's national defense is
based on the nuclear deterrent, and basically it has been since the
Truman administration,'' West said.
   Last year, the APHA endorsed a resolution calling for a ban on
nuclear testing.
   ``These facilities must be phased out,'' said Jennie Tichenor, a
nurse and assistant director of the New York City-based Radioactive
Waste Campaign. She said the federal government should ``close them
down, undo as much as possible and never repeat it.''
   The panel called for appropriating money to retrain workers who
would lose their jobs if the plants were closed down; exhuming
on-site waste; making the Energy Department subject to public
scrutiny; and conducting epidemiological studies of workers.

   Less than a week after California voters threw the
insurance business into turmoil by ordering a rate rollback,
Allstate Insurance Co. announced Monday it is leaving Massachusetts
because of losses and frustration over the state's regulatory
climate.
   The announcement came about a week after several insurers doing
business in California promised to leave the nation's biggest market
after voters approved a measure providing deep cuts in auto and
other insurance rates.
   Kevin Sullivan, director of Allstate's Group Auto division, told
a news conference that Allstate has lost $115 million in
Massachusetts over the past five years, largely due to the ``unique
regulatory environment'' for auto insurance.
   Allstate would be the third major insurer to abandon
Massachusetts, following Kemper Group and Fireman's Fund Insurance
Cos. Two smaller companies also have pulled out.
   Allstate will not renew its license when it expires June 30.
Until then, it will sell new policies and follow through on current
ones until they expire, he said.
   Peter Rice, deputy Massachusetts insurance commissioner, reacted
with ``complete surprise.''
   ``I guess our overall assessment is we think the company was
premature in assessing the effect of the recently passed auto reform
bill on the market,'' Rice said.
   Last week, a bill was signed that will reduce 1989 insurance
premiums by 16 percent, or $400 million, by cracking down on fraud
and abuse, reducing required coverages and limiting the number of
auto cases that end up in court. The legislation comes after
industry court challenges and rate decisions increased Massachusetts
rates by nearly one third since 1986 to among the highest in the
country.
   Sullivan said Allstate saw encouraging improvements in the bill.
But he said it did not restore free markets.
   Massachusetts requires all companies wishing to sell any form of
insurance in the state participate in an open ``high-risk'' auto
insurance pool.
   In addition, state law forbids open competition for automobile
insurance. Instead, the state insurance commissioner annually
calculates a single statewide rate for each category of compulsory
and optional insurance. Only Texas has a similar system.
   Allstate, based in Northbrook, Ill., has 6.6 percent of the
Massachusetts auto insurance market and 5.2 percent of the state's
homeowners insurance market.
   Massachusetts accounts for some $199 million of Allstate's
premiums annually, or about 2 percent of the company's business in
the United States.
   In California, voters last week approved Proposition 103, which
mandates that property and casualty insurers roll their rates back
to a level 20 percent below those in effect on Nov. 8, 1987. In
addition, drivers with good records would get an additional 20
percent off.
   However, the California Supreme Court has delayed the start of
the law while it considers its constitutionality.
   Allstate had no intention to pull out of California, saying the
key difference is that California allows ``open competition,''
Sullivan said.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday that 168 U.N. workers have been arrested, detained or
kidnapped over in a one-year period, and urged member nations to
guarantee the safety of his staff.
   ``It is painful for me to recall the names of our colleagues,
including Lt. Col. William Higgins and Mr. Alec Collett, who are
still in captivity or missing,'' he said. ``The United Nations has
so far been rendered unable to extend to them the protection which
is their right.''
   Higgins, a U.S. Marine, was abducted Feb. 17 while serving as
chief of a 75-man observer corps attached to the U.N. peacekeeping
force in Lebanon. A group calling itself the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, claimed responsibility.
   Collett, a Briton, was seized March 25, 1985, while on assignment
in Lebanon for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency.
   They are among 14 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing
in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, believed
linked to Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal, claimed on April 23,
1986, to have hanged Collett in retaliation for the U.S. air raid on
Libya, but no body was found.
   Perez de Cuellar said the 168 U.N. workers were reported
arrested, detained or abducted from July 1, 1987, through June 30,
1988, in 16 member nations or territories.
   ``More than 100 staff or members of their families still remain
imprisoned or detained, have disappeared or died, or are being held
against their will in a country,'' said a report he submitted to the
General Assembly's Fifth Committee, which deals with personnel
problems.
   Most were members of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency detained in
the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip or West Bank, the report said,
adding that other members of the relief agency's staff are detained
or missing in Syria or held in Lebanon by ``militias or unknown
elements.''
   ``I must emphasize that it is also the responsibility of member
states, individually as well as collectively, to arrange that staff
members may perform their individual duties effectively _ free from
arrest, detention or abduction,'' the secretary-general declared.
   He said governments should guarantee arrested or detained U.N.
employees access to other U.N. staff members within 24 hours and
furnish a written explanation within 48 hours.
   The report, prepared by the Federation of International Civil
Servants' Associations, listed 110 cases of U.N. workers whose
fundamental rights had been violated, including some cases dating to
the 1970s.
   Eight U.N. workers were arrested or prevented from carrying out
their duties in Afghanistan in 1979-1984, including Bismillah Kamkai
of the U.N. Development Program, who was put to death, and Tawakal
Shah of the U.N. Children's Fund, imprisoned and believed dead, the
report said.
   Others include a woman arrested in 1976 during the Argentine
military junta's ``dirty war'' on leftists, still missing and
presumed dead, and two women killed after being arrested in Chile in
1973 and 1976.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will make
another visit to the United States next month to address the United
Nations and will meet with President Reagan, U.S. officials said
Monday.
   Gorbachev also is expected to meet with President-elect George
Bush while he is in New York.
   The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
a report by CBS.
   Earlier, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa would visit London Dec. 12-14.
   Reagan met with Gorbachev in Washington last December, the third
of their four summit meetings. They signed a treaty to abolish U.S.
and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush said last week he was interested in a meeting with Gorbachev
if it could produce progress on arms control, human rights or
regional disputes.
   But first, Bush said, he would have James A. Baker III, who he
has named his choice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and with foreign ministers
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Bush ruled out a mere get-acquainted session. ``I am acquainted
with him,'' the president-elect said. ``What I want to see is
progress. I`ve never supported meetings just for the sake of having
meetings.''
   Reagan first met with Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland, in
November 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in Iceland,
then met in Washington last December and in Moscow May 29-June 2.
   The two superpowers are close to an agreement to sharply reduce
their strategic nuclear weapons, but are wrestling with problems
over how to verify some of the cutbacks.
   On the regional front, the Soviets have suspended the withdrawal
of their troops from Afghanistan. But the pullout is not supposed to
completed until Feb. 15, and Reagan administration officials have
expressed confidence the Soviets would meet the deadline.
   Phyllis Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman, said of a
Gorbachev visit: ``There has been no official announcement from the
U.S.S.R. on this question. Therefore it is inappropriate for us to
comment now.''

<HEAD>Strike By Oil Workers Spreads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More oil workers walked off the job
Monday, joining a strike that has virtually paralyzed the petroleum
refining industry in Latin America's biggest country.
   Some workers at offshore and land wells joined the strike by
refinery workers that began Friday, according to Petrobras, the
state-owned oil monopoly.
   Petrobras spokesman Lucio Pimentel said 80 percent of Brazil's
60,000 oil workers were now on strike ``and our guess is that this
percentage will keep growing.''
   The strike has shut down eight of Brazil's 10 refineries.
Refineries in the Amazon jungle city of Manaus and in
central-eastern Belo Horizonte still were operating, he said.
   Those two refineries have a daily production capacity of close to
135,000 barrels. Brazil's total daily production capacity is 1.5
million barrels of gasoline, diesel oil, cooking gas and other
petroleum products.
   Mauro Costa, of the national strike command, said by telephone
from Brasilia that the Manaus and Belo Horizonte refineries were
being run by night-shift crews who had been on duty Thursday night,
a few hours before the strike began.
   ``They are being forced to remain at their jobs by Petrobras,
which is pressuring them with threats of dismissal,'' Costa said.
Petrobras would not comment on Costa's charges.
   Pimentel estimated Petrobras had enough gasoline and diesel oil
stockpiled to last 10 more days. Cooking gas supplies were
sufficient for five days.
   Brazil consumes about 1.1 million barrels of fuel a day, he added.
   Brazil has 6,987 oil wells on land and 1,088 offshore wells, with
a total output of 560,000 barrels a day. Pimentel said the strike
has cut production by about 100,000 barrels
   Costa said the strikers were demanding a 354 percent pay
increase, while Petrobras offered close to 70 percent. He said oil
workers earn an average of about $300 a month.
   Inflation in Brazil is running at over 1,000 percent a year.
   Last week, Durval Gomes of the Rio de Janeiro Refinery Workers
Union said the strikers were demanding a 154 percent increase and
that the average wage was $1,365 a month.
   ``I don't know where Gomes got those figures but they are
completely wrong,'' Costa said.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Report on Drug Trafficking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors across the country are compiling
detailed reports on narcotics trafficking in their areas, as part of
a federal effort to focus attention on the nation's drug problem.
   The Justice Department sent a memo to U.S. attorneys Nov. 4
calling for detailed analyses spelling out the financial structure
of narcotics trafficking, ``the involvement of legitimate and
non-legitimate businesses'' and other details about drug
organizations.
   The directive was based on a recent speech in which Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh asked the prosecutors to outline the
corporate structure of narcotics trafficking ``so that we can fully
educate the American public.''
   The memo from Laurence McWhorter, director of the executive
office for U.S. attorneys, says that ``your analysis will become a
part of a public document.
   ``Your report should be based upon matters of public record ...
as well as present investigations to the extent that such
information will not compromise sensitive ongoing investigations,''
said McWhorter's memo.
   ``You should take the extra step of circulating your report in
`draft' form to the pertinent law enforcement leadership in your
District to assure an accurate depiction of the problem and to guard
against disclosure of sensitive information,'' the memo added.
   The attorney general wants an interim report by Dec. 19 and a
final report by March 1.
   The suggested format for the report includes relevant information
regarding accounting, banking, financing, communication, money
laundering schemes, payment of `mules,' currency and tax fraud.
   It also suggests an explanation of the impact of narcotics
businesses on crime, including the ``nature and extent of public
corruption, if any.''
   In his recent speech, Thornburgh said he wants to ``drag'' the
narcotics trafficking business ``out from under the rock where it
lives and breeds'' so that the American public ``will better
understand and more enthusiastically support the difficult struggle
in which we are engaged.''

<TEXT>
   Firefighters worked on a ``wet and smother''
assault Monday against a tenacious underground landfill fire that
forced the evacuation of more than 25 families.
   A contractor continued digging large trenches on two sides of the
smoldering area Monday while acrid smoke poured from about two acres
of the 17-acre landfill.
   When finished, the 30 feet wide by 30 feet deep and 400 feet long
trenches are to be filled in with dirt to form a firebreak similar
to ones used in fighting forest fires. Emergency services officials
have used such phrases as ``supply lines'' and ``establish a
perimeter'' to describe tactics used against the blaze.
   ``It sounds like the military with all these terms,'' said Paul
Lent, director of emergency services for Saratoga County.
   The fire, which started Thursday night, forced the evacuation of
25 to 30 families. Most of the people had found lodging with friends
or relatives and are still being urged to stay away from their
homes, Lent said.
   Saratoga Hospital reported 35 people, most of them firefighters,
had been treated for respiratory problems from the smoke.
   Lent said more than a million gallons of water and 30,000 cubic
yards of dirt would be used in the county's ``wet and smother''
strategy for putting out the fire.
   ``But we have to make sure it's out before we bury it or else
we'll be back _ and soon,'' Lent said.
   Lent said it would be premature to estimate when the fire would
be completely out.
   ``The fire chief feels he's gained on it today, but there's still
a lot of fire out there,'' said Lee Palmer, spokesman for the
Saratoga County emergency services coordinator.
   Traces of toxic polychlorinated byphenyls, or PCBs, were found in
the smoke but the state Department of Health said the levels of the
chemicals did not exceed federal standards. More air and water tests
were conducted Monday by the health department and the state
Department of Environmental Conservation. Results from those tests
were expected to be released Tuesday, Lent said.
   The city of Saratoga Springs kept in effect a health alert,
urging residents of its west side to stay inside if they have
respiratory problems. Sunday's overcast skies and westerly winds
helped spread the smoke over the city, but by Monday it had cleared,
although a slight acrid smell remained.
   Lent said the dump contains plastic piping, gypsum board, wood
and other building materials placed there by its owner, John Rock,
who has been charged with operating a dump without a permit.
   Rock's landfill is classified by the state Department of
Environmental Conservation as a construction and demolition debris
landfill. Until this year, permits for such landfills were not
required if the dumps were to be in operation for less than a year.
   ``The concern is that a large number of them are not even
reported to us,'' said Bob Phaneuf, associate sanitary engineer for
the DEC's Division of Solid Waste.
   He said construction debris leaves large underground air pockets
that allow fire to spread more easily than it would in a municipal
landfill.

   The dollar bounced back Monday after a weeklong
slide, supported by the Japanese and U.S. central banks and calming
statements from American officials.
   Last week's slide was brought about by fears that President-elect
George Bush and his advisers wanted the dollar to fall to make U.S.
goods more competitive and shrink the trade deficit.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady helped quell those
suspicions on Sunday by issuing a statement that ``the
administration remains committed to exchange-rate stability.''
   Bush backed Brady on Monday by saying he was fully committed to
the Reagan administration's policy of coordinated actions with other
major countries to stabilize the value of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets.
   In contrast to last week's bearishness, ``People weren't that
sure today if the new administration really wants the dollar down,''
said Peter Wild, a senior trader at Switzerland's Bank Julius Baer &
Co. in New York.
   The dollar began the trading day Monday in Tokyo at 122.55
Japanese, near the Jan. 4 low that was the lowest since modern
exchange rates were established in the late 1940s.
   A rebound began when the Bank of Japan bought dollars in the open
market, traders said. The dollar closed at 123.00 yen. Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi
Sumita said Japanese authorities were ready to strengthen their
intervention efforts if the need arose.
   The dollar continued to rise in Europe and the United States as
trading followed the sun, and on Tuesday morning in Tokyo it opened
at 123.60 yen. Bush's statement and dollar purchases by the Federal
Reserve helped counter attempts by traders to carry the currency
lower, several traders said.

Washington Tuesday to say goodbye to President Reagan, a friend with
whom she has marched in close ideological step from the day he came
to office.
   She will also be meeting President-elect George Bush to welcome
him into the ranks of Western leaders, of whom she is the
longest-serving.
   Reagan came to office 1{ years after Mrs. Thatcher, and together
they have reinvigorated the long-standing special relationship
between the two countries.
   But while Reagan is obliged to step down, Mrs. Thatcher faces no
such constraints. Her present tenure lasts another four years, and
she has served notice that she will seek an unprecedented fourth
term in the 1990s. So the likelihood is that she will be working
with Bush right up to 1992.
   In a speech Monday night, Mrs. Thatcher thanked Reagan ``for
ending the West's retreat from world responsibilty, for restoring
the pride and leadership of the U.S. and for giving the West back
its confidence ... in the success of free enterprise ... in the
values which guide our societies.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said Bush would be ``a worthy successor'' and
added: ``We know him as a friend, we admire him as a man of
unrivaled experience and we respect him because he stands for all
that is best in America.''
   Sharing a profound anti-communist ideology, distaste for
welfarism, faith in free markets and belief in negotiating from
strength, Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher have managed to agree on most of
the issues that have confronted them through the 1980s.
   They have helped each other out at critical movements, and at
great political risk _ Reagan by approving vital arms supplies and
intelligence to Britain in the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina,
and Mrs. Thatcher by allowing the Reagan to use U.S. bombers based
on British soil to bomb Libya in 1986.
   ``We must brace ourselves for a Niagara of mutual admiration,''
wrote columnist George Walden of the conservative Daily Telegraph,
previewing this last journey by Mrs. Thatcher to the Reagan White
House. ``The personal relationship has indeed been special.''
   In the view of David Dimbleby and David Reynolds, in their recent
book on Anglo-American relations, Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher have
``established one of the closest personal bonds in the history of
Anglo-American cooperation and breathed new life into the special
relationship.''
   Mrs. Thatcher arrives in Washington on Tuesday evening, and will
have talks with Reagan Wednesday, followed by a state dinner. On
Thursday she will have talks with Bush, and return home Friday.
   A foretaste of the emotional farewells in store came in June,
when Reagan stopped in London en route home from the Moscow summit
with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Britain had played a role in the Reagan-Gorbachev thaw. Mrs.
Thatcher was the first major Western leader to visit the Soviet
leader, and on his way to Washington to sign the arms-reduction
treaty, Gorbachev stopped in England for talks with the prime
minister.
   Reagan paid lavish tribute to Mrs. Thatcher's leadership, and
Mrs. Thatcher responded in kind.
   ``You have restored faith in the American dream,'' the Iron Lady
told the Great Communicator. ``Your personal courage, your gentle
humor and your spirit of optimism are all part of the special
quality that you brought to the presidency.''
   Replied Reagan: ``The entire world salutes you and your gallant
people and gallant nation.''
   Left-wing opponents call Mrs. Thatcher ``Reagan's Poodle,''
claiming she doesn't make a move without his approval.
   Mrs. Thatcher argues that the United States, as leader and
defender of the free world, must be heeded, and the special
relationship is a pillar of her foreign policy.
   They don't agree on everything. A believer in thrifty, debt-free
housekeeping, Mrs. Thatcher worries about the U.S. deficit. But she
does not believe in criticizing the president outright.
   ``I think she believes that we can only hope to influence the
United States in private and affect their judgments ... if the basic
relationship is extremely good,'' says Sir Anthony Parsons, her
former foreign affairs adviser.

   The IRA fired mortar bombs at
the Cookstown security base Monday and wounded two members of the
Ulster Defense Regiment, police said.
   Five civilians who were stunned by shock waves from the blast at
Cookstown, about 53 miles west of Belfast, were taken to a hospital,
they said.
   Police said it was the third mortar attack on the base this year
by the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to drive
the British out of the province.
   They said the bombs, launched from tubes in a van parked opposite
the base, wounded two regiment members and did substantial damage to
buildings. Two other bombs stuck in their tubes, apparently failing
to fire, and an army bomb disposal expert defused them.
   The Ulster Defense Regiment is a locally staffed, mainly
part-time security force.
   In Belfast, a police statement said rockets, guns, thousands of
bullets and more than 3,500 pounds of explosives were seized in a
security crackdown in the past five weeks.
   Almost 700,000 vehicles were stopped, 1,100 buildings searched
and 66 people charged with ``terrorist-type offenses,'' including 14
of murder or attempted murder.
   The statement followed complaints from the Roman Catholic
minority of harassment but the police said: ``Searching for arms and
explosives must and will continue. Life is at stake.''
   ``We know that the IRA, north and south of the border, are still
in possession of considerable caches of arms and explosives as a
result of the shipments which came into the (Irish) Republic from
Libya,'' it said.

   California's attorney general asked the
state Supreme Court on Monday to allow a voter-approved 20 percent
cut in insurance rates to take effect while the court reviews
insurance company lawsuits.
   ``The voters believed that they were enacting immediate insurance
reform with the adoption of Proposition 103,'' Attorney General John
Van de Kamp said in papers filed with the court. ``That expectation
should not be frustrated without giving the initiative a fair chance
to work.''
   He asked the court to withdraw the order it issued last Thursday
blocking enforcement of Proposition 103. As an alternative, Van de
Kamp said, the court should allow all provisions of the measure to
take effect except the 20 percent rate rollback, and should require
insurance companies to set aside enough money to lower their
premiums if they lose their case.
   The initiative, backed by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, was
narrowly approved by state voters last Tuesday.
   Its provisions include a 20 percent reduction in insurance rates
from the rates in effect in November 1987; a freeze at those levels
until November 1989, when auto insurance rates would be cut an
additional 20 percent for ``good drivers''; exemption from the
rollback for insurers who could show a ``substantial threat of
insolvency,'ney needed to enter the case
now but were starting a fund-raising drive that would let them
intervene later.
   Van de Kamp's brief, by Deputy Attorney General Timothy Laddish,
asked the court to take the Proposition 103 case itself, rather than
referring it to a lower court, and decide the constitutional issues
quickly.
   ``With Californians paying billions of dollars each day in
(property and casualty insurance) premiums, it is obviously of great
urgency that they, and those who sell the insurance, know whether
the voters will get the relief for which they voted,'' Laddish wrote.
   In urging the court to lift the stay, he said insurers ``are not
likely to succeed'' in their suits, and have not shown that they
would suffer ``irreparable injury'' if Proposition 103 were allowed
to take effect while the case was pending.
   Laddish said the court has rejected the same constitutional
challenge against local rent-control laws that rolled back rents to
a previous period and required administrative approval for future
increases. He compared those laws to Proposition 103, which allows
the insurance commissioner to consider a company's financial
situation in granting exemptions from the 20 percent rollback and in
reviewing future rate increase applications.
   As a fallback position, Laddish contended most provisions of
Proposition 103 do not threaten immediate injury to insurers and
should be allowed to take effect while the lawsuits are pending.
   Those provisions include state review of future rate increases; a
repeal of the insurance industry's exemption from state antitrust
laws, and new limits on a company's authority to refuse to renew an
insurance policy.
   The current blanket order blocking enforcement of the entire
measure hurts consumers needlessly and may prevent the state
Department of Insurance from making preparations for its new duties
under the intiative, Laddish said.
   If the court leaves in place its stay of the rate rollback, the
state lawyer said, it should require insurance companies to set
aside the amounts of money needed to pay for the rate reductions,
plus interest, if the reductions are later upheld.

   Many of the 53 children removed from a home
operated by the Ecclesia Athletic Association said Monday they're
eager to return to the farmhouse where an 8-year-old girl was beaten
to death and that they miss the man they call ``Big El.''
   ``Nobody's as nice to us as Big El,'' said a 13-year-old boy,
referring to Eldridge Broussard Jr., 36, leader of the Los
Angeles-based group and father of the slain girl.
   The children were taken from a sparsely furnished farmhouse east
of Portland following the Oct. 14 beating death of Dayna Lorea
Broussard. Juvenile authorities claim many of the Ecclesia children
were administered ritualistic beatings of up to 800 strokes with
electrical cords or paddles.
   During brief interviews with the children Monday, reporters were
prevented from asking about their life in Ecclesia. None of the
children's names was revealed.
   The 22 Ecclesia boys, ages 3 to 14, live together in a dormitory
on the MacLaren School campus in Woodburn, while 15 girls, ranging
in age from 4 to 16, are living in a four-bedroom, ranch-style house
at Hillcrest School. The remainder of the children are in foster
care.
   The farmhouse was used by Ecclesia members to train inner-city
children in athletics as part of Broussard's dream of a role in a
future Olympics in Africa.
   The children will remain in state custody until criminal
proceedings are completed against four adult Ecclesia members
scheduled to be tried Dec. 12 on first-degree manslaughter charges.
   Custody proceedings will begin after the trial to determine the
children's fate.
   Several of the children have had visits from their parents, but
they have not been allowed to talk to Broussard, said Les Busch, who
has designed a program to care for the Ecclesia children.
   Broussard's frequent television appearances and news stories
about the case have been kept from the children.
   ``We just feel it's too much for them to handle at this point,''
he said.
   Psychiatric evaluations are scheduled this week for most of the
children, Busch added.
   Staff members say the children have shown signs of post-traumatic
stress disorder, including anxiety, bed-wetting and irregular
sleeping patterns, said Busch.
   Dayna's death has been discussed with the children, he said.
Several of the older girls wanted to attend the girl's funeral, and
the boys decorated their Halloween cake with a candle lighted to
remember their playmate, who would have been 9 on Oct. 31.
   ``We're trying to establish a safe, secure shelter situation for
these kids,'' said Busch, head of the Children's Psychiatric Day
Treatment Center at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland.
   ``I'd rather be with my coach. Even though he makes us work out,
I still don't mind,'' said one 8-year-old girl.
   ``Nobody's even close to being as nice as Big El,'' added a
14-year-old boy.
   Several girls complained they had been in state custody for too
long.
   ``They lied to us,'' said one girl. ``They told us we'd be here
overnight and it's been one month and one day.''

<TEXT>
   Arab leaders in the Israeli-occupied lands
hailed Tuesday's declaration of an independent Palestinian state as
the beginning of a new era of political moderation and dialogue.
   Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip shot off firecrackers,
flew balloons and raised outlawed Palestinian flags to celebrate the
declaration by the PLO-backed Palestine National Council in Algiers,
the Algerian capital.
   Leaders of the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip also called a general
strike Tuesday to mark independence day.
   The declaration was expected to fuel the uprising, but was not
believed to have much effect on everyday life in the occupied lands.
   The declaration and accompanying resolutions implicitly recognize
Israel's right to exist, meeting some of the conditions the United
States has set for dealing with the PLO in peace talks.
   But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir reiterated his position
that Israel would never negotiate with the PLO.
   ``It's not a problem of definition and formulations on various
positions,'' Shamir said Monday. ``We'll not negotiate with them
because they are opposed to peace in Israel.''
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, was entrusted Monday
by President Chaim Herzog with forming a coalition government and is
likely to be Israel's leader for the next four years.
   Shamir and other Israeli leaders, including Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres of the left-of-center Labor Party, have said they would
not tolerate a Palestinian state in the occupied lands.
   Shamir also opposes returning Israeli-occupied territory in
exchange for peace and holding peace talks within the framework of
an international peace conference, a forum endorsed by the PLO.
   Instead, Shamir favors direct talks with Arab states on limited
Palestinian autonomy.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands were optimistic that the
independence declaration would lead to a political breakthrough.
   West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians repeatedly had expressed
their frustration with PLO leaders who for months were divided over
whether to recognize Israel and renounce terror. The quarreling was
blamed for the Palestinians' failure to translate the uprising into
political gains.
   ``This is the beginning of a new era for the Palestinians and the
beginning of moderation in facing our problems,'' said lawyer Fayez
Abu Rahme, a prominent PLO supporter in the Gaza Strip.
   ``It shows the Palestinians are ready to co-exist with Israel,
that they want a state side-by-side with Israel,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   Abu Rahme said the PLO's new moderate stance would enable the
United States to exert pressure on Israel to be more flexible in its
positions. Washington backs an international conference and a
territories-for-peace formula.
   On Monday night, Palestinians in some parts of the Gaza Strip
broke curfews and took to the streets in anticipation of the
declaration of independence.
   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, residents set off firecrackers
and shouted ``Allahu Akhbar'' (God is Great), an Arab reporter said.
   Elsewhere, residents flew balloons and hoisted pictures of Arafat
to express their joy. Other Gaza Strip residents remained glued to
the radio for news from Algiers.
   At least 312 Palestinians have been killed since a rebellion
began Dec. 8, 1987, among the 1.5 million who live in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 war. Eleven Israelis also have died.

   Detectives using backhoes and steel
probes dug up sixth and seventh bodies Monday from the yard of a
rooming house whose missing landlady once said she took in elderly
boarders as a way to repay society.
   The sixth and seventh corpses _ unidentified like the others _
were discovered shortly after digging resumed Monday morning.
   The sixth corpse was ``wrapped in some type of clothing,'' and
buried in a shallow grave under a shed, said police Sgt. Bob Burns.
The seventh was found Monday afternoon, by searchers using a
backhoe, under a flower bed in the front yard, said Lt. Joe Enloe.
   The cause of death was not immediately known.
   On Monday, 200 spectators watched from behind police lines as
investigators worked at the grounds of the home. Authorities say
there could be eight bodies buried.
   Burns said police are still searching for the landlady, Dorothea
Montalvo Puente, 59. ``Our first priority is to get her into
custody,'' he said.
   Burns said investigators were told she ran a board-and-care home
eight or nine years ago about eight blocks away, and authorities
were interviewing tenants and neighbors there. There were no
immediate plans to dig at that property, Burns added.
   Authorities issued an all-points bulletin for Puente, who
disappeared Friday after detectives interviewed her for several
hours and released her for lack of evidence.
   Authorities believe the victims, apparently all low-income
elderly people and all residents of the eight-room Victorian home
downtown _ were killed for their Social Security checks. Enloe said
the payments continued to be sent to them after their disappearances
but that someone else fraudulently cashed their checks. On Monday,
detectives planned to examine Puente's bank records, Enloe said.
   Police were led to the house after neighbors reported that a
friend had been missing since August, and a social worker said some
of her clients were missing.
   Burns said police planned to get a search warrant for the home,
which is sealed, later Monday.
   Enloe said the means of death could not be determined until
autopsies were performed. Evidence linking Puente to the deaths was
found in the graves, said Enloe, but he declined to give details.
   A social worker familiar with the rooming house described the
residents as elderly people on fixed incomes with few relatives.
   The case worker, Peggy Nickerson, told police that Puente had
come to her in 1986, offering lodging. Nickerson said she referred
19 clients to the house during the last two years.
   ``She (Puente) was the best the system had to offer. She said she
was a widow and had a big house, and she said it was her time to
give back to other people. ... That was her story and I didn't have
any reason to doubt her,'' Nickerson said. ``I deal with a transient
population and it's not unusual for people to be staying at a place
and just pick up and leave.''
   The list of possible identities grew throughout the day. ``We are
getting a large number of calls from people with relatives who have
stayed here. We are trying to determine the welfare of these
people,'' Burns said.
   ``There are a lot more than eight names,'' he said, referring to
the original list of occupants supplied by a social worker.
``There's a big list of names. We've got detectives scurrying all
over this city.''
   Several neighbors periodically complained of a stench from the
yard that smelled like dead animals. Puente told them it was a fish
emulsion used as fertilizer, they said.
   ``It struck me that the tomato plants in the yard were doing
beautifully,'' said Vera Smith, a worker for Catholic Social
Services who visited a man staying at the home. ``The whole place
was smothered. I was tempted to go and pick one.''
   Another neighbor, property manager Will McIntyre, said Puente was
up daily at 4:30 a.m. to do gardening and used to dig in the lot
behind her rooming house, where there were ``6-foot-long
depressions.'' The lot now is covered by a house that was moved in
in 1985.
   Burns said police would investigate McIntyre's report.
   In 1982, Puente was convicted of drugging and robbing people in
bars, and sentenced to a five-year term. She was paroled after 2{
years, said Christine May, a spokeswoman for the state Corrections
Department.
   A victim in that case, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, told The Sacramento Bee that Puente ``came into the bar
and gave us a pill, to all three of us, and knocked us out. She
stole a diamond ring from me, took my wallet and wristwatch.''
   Authorities, acting on information from Nickerson and others,
believe a total of ``seven or eight'' bodies may be buried at the
house.
   On Sunday, police arrested John McCauley, 59, a resident of the
house, on suspicion of being an accessory after the fact to
homicide. He was in custody in Sacramento County jail.
   Authorities believe McCauley assisted Puente after the slayings,
and that she may have arranged for others to dig the victims'
graves, police said. ``We do not believe that this could have been
done solely by herself,'' Enloe said.

<TEXT>
   The PLO's parliament on Tuesday
proclaimed an independent Palestinian homeland with Jerusalem as its
capital, and extended an olive branch by implicitly recognizing
Israel.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat read the declaration early Tuesday to
a chamber filled with delegates to the 450-member Palestine National
Council, Arab dignitaries and observers, who broke into long
applause and loud cheers.
   Wearing the traditional black-and-white checked headdress, Arafat
read his speech in Arabic in a low, solemn voice.
   His voice rising to a crescendo at 1:38 a.m. (7:38 p.m. EST
Monday), he said:
   ``The Palestinian National Council hereby declares the
establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,
which will be for all Palestinians wherever they are.''
   The PLO leader declared the new Palestinian state would be
government by ``a democratic, parliamentary system based on freedom
of opinion, multiple parties, freedom of worship and equality
between men and women.''
   The declaration of the new state did not set out its boundaries,
which the Palestinians say should be determined in future
negotiations.
   It had been expected that the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip would be included in the homeland. Israel captured the West
Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Algerian Foreign Minister Boualem Bessaieh announced to the
council that Algeria officially recognized the new state, becoming
the first country to do so.
   The declaration came shortly after the council had endorsed a new
political strategy implicitly recognizing the state of Israel and
renouncing terrorism.
   In Washington on Monday, President Reagan said PLO recognition of
Israel ``would be some progress,'' but added: ``There are other
problems that remain to be solved.''
   Israel rejected results of the Algiers meeting in advance.
   ``We will not negotiate with the PLO,'' said Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir. ``It's not a problem of definition and formulations
of various positions. We'll not negotiate with them because they're
opposed to peace with Israel.''
   Arafat and other PLO leaders consider the independence
declaration a historic step toward creation of an independent state
in the West Bank and Gaza. The council meeting is called the
``Intefadeh'' session after the 11-month-old uprising among the 1.5
million Palestinians of the occupied lands.
   The Arab League formed the council in 1964, but it has assumed
the role of PLO legislature.
   The approval of the new political strategy implicitly recognizing
Israel's right to exist marked a major victory for Arafat's campaign
for a more moderate policy that would meet some of Washington's
conditions for dealing with the PLO, attempting to build on the
uprising in the occupied territories.
   The council endorsed the ``political declaration,'' with 253 of
its members voting for it, 46 voting against and 10 abstaining,
reported Dr. Assaad Abdel-Rahman, a council member from Jordan,
confirming reports from council sources.
   Some other council members were absent because the voting session
was called at short notice, immediately after the council's
political committee completed drafting the declaration.
   Abdel-Rahman said Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, and others of his group who also are
council members were among those who voted against the draft in the
show of hands. Habash, a radical, already had said he would accept
the rule of the majority.
   ``Habash, as the leader of the opposition, made a beautiful
speech after the vote, saying he was very happy about the great show
of democracy,'' Abdel-Rahman said. He quoted Habash as saying, ``Let
me suggest that our slogan from now on be, `Unity until victory,
revolution until victory.'''
   That slogan later was chanted as Arafat entered the hall.
   Palestinians in the Gaza Strip shot off firecrackers, flew
balloons and raised the outlawed Palestinian flag to celebrate the
declaration.
   A third resolution endorsed at the meeting empowers the PLO's
ruling 15-man Executive Committee and the Central Council, a
70-member senate-like body, to form a provisional government at a
later stage.
   The government, Palestinian officials say, will not replace the
PLO but will act as one of its institutions, with a mandate to
negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians in the framework of a U.N.
international conference.
   The strategy drawn is designed mainly to polish the PLO's image
in the West and transform the sympathy won by the revolt in the
territories into political gains.
   The council endorsed U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and
338 as ``the basis for an international conference, while stressing
the necessity to guarantee Palestinian national and political
rights, foremost of which is the right to self-determination.''
   Resolution 242 implicitly recognizes Israel by referring to the
right of all states in the region to live in peace within secure and
recognized borders. It also calls for withdrawal from lands Israel
occupied in 1967.
   The PLO long had rejected the resolution as the basis for peace,
arguing that it treated the Palestinians only as a refugee problem,
ignoring their quest for self-determination and a homeland.
   Resolution 338, adopted in 1973, called for implementation of 242.
   The United States had demanded that the PLO endorse 242,
explicitly recognize the Jewish state and renounce terrorism before
allowing the organization any role in the Middle East peace process.
   The council also took a stand on terrorism, reiterating
commitment to what is called the Cairo Declaration and endorsing
U.N. resolutions on the issue.
   The Cairo declaration, mediated by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, was signed in 1985. It limited Palestinian guerrilla
operations to military targets in Israel.
   The new statement goes a step further, restricting guerrilla
action to military targets in Israeli-occupied territories.

   Israeli soldiers fought
protesters Monday, killing one and wounding at least four, while
Palestinians in the occupied lands celebrated the PLO declaration of
an independent homeland.
   At least 312 Palestinians have been killed since a rebellion
began Dec. 8, 1987, among the 1.5 million who live in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 war. Eleven Israelis also have died.
   Troopers arrested dozens of alleged guerrillas and destroyed or
sealed nine houses in the effort to prevent pro-PLO demonstrations
while the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature, meets in Algiers.
   ``The Palestinian National Council hereby declares the
establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,
which will be for all Palestinians wherever they are,'' Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, announced
in Algiers early Tuesday.
   The Gaza Strip's 650,000 residents remained under curfew for a
third day. Arab reports and Israel radio said some violated the
restrictions because of the council's declaration of an independent
state.
   Palestinians lit firecrackers, raised outlawed Palestinian flags,
flew balloons and hoisted pictures of Arafat.
   Residents of Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp shouted ``Allahu
Akhbar!'' (God is Great!) and sang ``My Homeland, My Homeland,'' the
Palestinian anthem, an Arab journalist reported.
   Among the words are: ``Palestine live free, live liberated from
the enemy. Palestine, you are the mother of the world ... the symbol
of the holy war.''
   Soldiers using loudspeakers ordered residents to their homes but
took no other action, the reporter said.
   A young Palestinian was killed in a confrontation at the Khan
Yunis camp in Gaza, the army reported. Israel radio said he was
throwing concrete blocks at a patrol when an officer opened fire.
   Youths in Gaza City blocked a main street with burning tires and
rocks, said an Arab reporter at the scene.
   Telephones were cut off in many areas of the West Bank and a
reporter who visited Jericho, near the Jordanian border, said
residents were being prevented from leaving the city.
   Soldiers in jeeps and on foot patrolled villages on the main
highway from Jerusalem to Nablus, largest city in the West Bank, and
on the road west to Tulkarem.
   Israeli officials repeated their view that a declaration of
Palestinian independence would be meaningless.
   ``We will not negotiate with the PLO,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir told reporters in Jerusalem. ``It's not a problem of
definition and formulations of various positions. We'll not
negotiate with them because they're opposed to peace with Israel.''
   Tulkarem, just inside the West Bank, was declared a closed
military area after troops bulldozed three houses of suspected
firebombers. Soldiers blocked reporters from entering the town of
40,000.
   While dozens of troops could be seen patrolling the town, no one
else was visible on the streets and all shops appeared to be
shuttered. At one point, two young boys appeared on a rooftop and
waved, but they disappeared when soldiers shouted at them.
   Army spokesmen refused to say when or exactly how many arrests
were made in the crackdown on underground groups announced Monday.
Israel radio said the announcement was meant to deter expected
violence if independence is declared.
   The army listed 54 people rounded up in five West Bank cities and
said guerrilla cells also were found to be operating in 11 other
areas.
   In addition to the houses destroyed in Tulkarem, five were
demolished in Bani Naim, near Nablus, and one was sealed in Hebron,
the army said.
   In Gaza, three teen-agers were shot by soldiers during
stone-throwing incidents, hospital officials said. One was a
14-year-old listed in serious condition with a stomach wound after
being shot in the town of Khan Yunis.
   In the West Bank, an 18-year-old was listed in serious condition
with a head wound after soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in the
old market area of Nablus, said officials at the city's Al-Ittihad
hospital.

   Authorities investigated but apparently
took no action on behalf of a woman who said she was forced to live
in an unheated shed, chained to a wall, while her husband lived with
another couple in a nearby trailer.
   Portions of heavy chain and a padlock were attached to the
22-year-old woman's waist and wrists when she sought help from a
neighbor Friday, said Lt. Norm Nickerson of the Spokane County
Sheriff's Department. Deputies used bolt cutters to free the
22-year-old woman, who was described as underfed and abused.
   Authorities apparently were told about the woman last April when
a neighbor showed them a copy of ``house rules'' the woman was
expected to follow, including when to bathe, what to wear and when
to have sex with her husband.
   Neighbors and others familiar with the case said the woman's
allegations were reported to the state Department of Social and
Health Services in April and again about a month ago.
   Frank Mendizabal, a DSHS spokesman in Olympia, said the case was
handled properly in April when allegations of sexual abuse were made.
   He said the case was referred to the sheriff's department for
investigation, and that no criminal charges were brought because the
woman told investigators she had willingly signed the house rules
and was not being forced to have sex against her will.
   A DSHS social worker met with the woman Monday to help explain
her options and plan for the future, Mendizabal said.
   Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Ethridge said the state agency asked the
sheriff's department to investigate in April, but detectives could
not find enough evidence to justify an arrest.
   ``The incident is still under investigation by our officers to
see if any criminal acts were involved,'' Nickerson said. ``We're
still trying to get the full story. We still haven't been able to
interview everyone involved. We're going into it quite extensively
in the next few days.''
   The woman apparently is married to a sergeant stationed at nearby
Fairchild Air Force Base who lived with another couple in a mobile
home near the shed. Ethridge said he questioned a man in the mobile
home who claimed to have married the woman in May.
   The woman told sheriff's deputies that she had been chained to a
wooden board inside an old, dilapidated camper she called ``the
shed,'' Ethridge said. ``It's not a place for human habitation,''
Ethridge said.
   ``It appears from the preliminary investigation there is merit to
her allegations,'' he said.
   Fran Pierson, the neighbor from whom the woman sought help, said
the woman was wearing an Air Force jacket, a dirty pair of men's
long underwear and military boots that were several sizes too large.
   The woman showed the list of rules to neighbor Wendy White in
April because she did not understand it.
   Ms. White gave copies of the rules to her father-in-law, an
Eastern State Hospital psychiatrist, who contacted the DSHS in
April. She said she was later called and told the matter had been
investigated.
   ``They didn't feel she was in any danger,'' she said. ``They just
said, `Don't worry. She'll be taken care of.'''
   The woman was treated at a Spokane hospital and is being cared
for at a temporary shelter, Nickerson said.

   Democrat John Vinich, who lost a close
Senate race to incumbent Republican Malcolm Wallop, said Monday he
will neither ask for a recount nor concede until after an official
review of the election this week.
   Unofficial returns show Vinich finished 1,315 votes behind Wallop
in last week's election, 89,806 to 91,121. Results won't be official
until the state Canvassing Board meets Wednesday.
   Vinich said the count was so close that he feels he owes it to
the people who voted for him to ``to take a close look at the
outcome of this race.''
   ``We're still waiting for the official records. I think that's
only appropriate,'' he said.
   Shortly after the initial returns came in, showing Wallop
defeating Vinich, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
charged that there were irregularities in the handling of absentee
ballots in the race.
   Secretary of State Kathy Karpan's office made a
precinct-by-precinct review of ballots late last week, and Karpan
said she was satisfied there were no problems.
   If the canvassing board also finds no problems with the returns,
Vinich will have until Friday evening to decide whether to call for
a recount. He would have to pay for it, which could run up to
$11,500.
   If the board finds irregularities, the state would pay for an
automatic recount.
   Any challenge the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would
want to make to the results would have to come through the courts,
according to the Karpan's office. If the courts agreed to overturn
the election results, that would force a special election.
   On Saturday. Vinich called on Wallop to join him in requesting a
recount. Vinich said Monday he had not received a response from
Wallop.
   A spokesman for Wallop said the incumbent has no interest in
joining Vinich in calling for a recount.
   ``Right now we see no reason for a recount. We are pleased with
Sen. Wallop's victory, and we've followed the process carefully,''
said Wallop spokesman Kevin Bohnenblust. He said, however, that the
incumbent had not received Vinich's letter.

   There was no great explosion of joy when
Yasser Arafat, leader and symbol of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, proclaimed an independent Palestinian state early
Tuesday.
   Instead, hundreds of dignified people expressed their emotions
quietly with handshakes, kisses and an occasional tear.
   In a jam-packed seaside conference hall west of Algiers, Arafat
read the declaration, which proclaims ``the establishment of the
state of Palestine.''
   The reading of the declaration by Arafat, wearing his usual
military fatigues and black-and-white checkered headdress, was
interrupted frequently by clapping and cheering, and high-pitched
ululations from the women.
   Spirits were high before the long-awaited session of the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, to
declare the existence of a state that once was and which they hope
would be again.
   In the lobby at the entrance to the meeting hall, spontaneous
songs and dances broke out. Then, at about 1 a.m. Algiers time _ 2
a.m. in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip where 1.5
million Palestinians live _ they filed into the round, wood-paneled
conference hall.
   As Arafat entered, many council members began chanting the new
slogan, ``Unity, unity until victory. Revolution, revolution until
victory.''
   The slogan was launched Monday by George Habash, leader of the
Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Habash had
opposed Arafat's new moderate policies, but ceded to the vote of the
council majority.
   The proclamation came at 1:38 a.m. (7:38 p.m. EST Monday).
   When the reading was over, people filed out slowly, mingling and
talking in low voices, not unlike the scene at a theater after the
final act.
   There were handshakes, smiles, solemn embraces and tears.
   ``It was a dignified ceremony,'' said council member Mustafa
Hallak. ``There was a lack of emotional demonstration perhaps
because we've known for a week it (the declaration) was coming.''
   Assaad Abdel-Rahman, another Council member, said he felt
different Tuesday morning after the declaration.
   ``Yes, I feel more secure and more responsible,'' Abdel-Rahman
said.
   ``If anything impressed me today, it was the behavior of the top
leadership. They were entirely responsible and democratic in ironing
out differences, very civilized, showing a high calibre of dealing
with differences.''

<HEAD>Meeting on Radioactive Waste Postponed; Gov. Romer to Meet with DOE</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meeting between Department of Energy officials
and three Western governors on hazardous waste storage problems at
the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant has been postponed, Gov. Roy
Romer said Monday.
   Romer was clearly angered at the postponement because several
railroad cars are sitting at Rocky Flats, filled with radioactive
waste, but have no place to go. The plant has only about a
four-month storage capacity.
   Romer, Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus and New Mexico Gov. Garrey
Carruthers were to meet Wednesday in Salt Lake City with DOE
officials to work on solutions to the storage problem.
   The meeting was postponed so Carruthers, a Republican, could
participate in a presidential transition team meeting, Romer said.
   In late October, Romer rejected plans to expand the storage
capacity at Rocky Flats, urging the DOE to expedite its search for a
permanent facility.
   A proposed site for permanent waste storage is scheduled to open
in New Mexico, but that has been delayed, to the annoyance of Romer
and other governors caught in a push-pull dilemma over existing
waste.
   After the New Mexico site's opening was delayed indefinitely,
Andrus banned further storage of waste at a site in Idaho, which
forced the return to Rocky Flats of one rail car filled with waste.
   Rocky Flats, the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago and the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., had been
shipping radioactive rags, machines parts, gloves, liquids and other
debris to the Idaho site, where an estimated 2 million cubic feet of
the waste is stored below ground and 2.4 million cubic feet is
stored above ground in steel barrels.
   Romer said he is insisting on a meeting with the DOE anyway
because of pressing problems at Rocky Flats. The agency has agreed
to send several representatives to Colorado on Wednesday.
   ``I wanted to have that meeting Wednesday. I called the
Department of Energy this afternoon and told them I wanted to go
ahead. They said they wanted to reschedule it because they felt it
was necessary for Carruthers to be there,'' he said.
   ``I told them we should reschedule the meeting as soon as
possible, and I told them I wanted to meet with them on Wednesday.''
   Cindy Parmenter, Romer's press aide, said the meeting will be
closed, but the participants will be available for reporters'
questions later in the day.

   Couples unable to bear children can contract for a
surrogate mother as long as the agreement does not provide money to
a woman for giving up her parental rights, a judge ruled Monday.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said the ruling by Wayne
County Circuit Judge John Gillis was confusing but apparently means
some surrogate contracts are valid in Michigan, where the nation's
most active surrogacy lawyer practices.
   The ACLU had sought to have the state law against pregnancy for
pay overturned, but Gillis reaffirmed his Sept. 19 finding that the
law was constitutional.
   ``This court,'' he wrote, ``finds that the Michigan Legislature
intended to prohibit all surrogate arrangements where the surrogate
mother is compensated (other than actual medical expenses as a
result of the pregnancy) and agrees to voluntarily relinquish her
parental rights to the child.
   ``It is important to note that individuals may still legally
enter into surrogate arrangements where there is no compensation
paid to the mother (other than actual medical expenses). All other
situations must be decided on a case-by-case basis.''
   Howard Simon, executive director of the Michigan ACLU, said he
wants to have Gillis' order clarified.
   ``I don't think it gives much guidance,'' he said. ``It does
appear, however, that he is adopting the interpretation that both we
and the attorney general agreed upon.
   ``It appears to have allowed us to accomplish what we wanted to
accomplish,'' he said. ``There are many, many couples for whom a
surrogate parenting arrangement is the only realistic option to
start a family.''
   At the Sept. 19 hearing, Assistant Attorney General Vincent Leone
said the statute prohibited any surrogate contract that included
money being paid in exchange for the woman giving up parental rights
to the child.
   Leone said the law does not address a woman's right to act as a
surrogate or receiving money for carrying the child.
   Simon said if Gillis agreed with that interpretation, the right
to enter a surrogate contract still exists in Michigan.
   ``The legal issue is, `Can you require a surrogate mother to
surrender her parental rights? Can you pay a surrogate mother to
give up the child she bore?''' Simon said.
   ``That's baby-selling. That's what should be prohibited by law.
You can never require a woman to relinquish her parental rights. The
payment has got to be for something else.''
   Gillis said the ACLU and other plaintiffs trying to have the
state law overturned ended any controversy when they agreed in
September that the law was constitutional.
   Noel Keane, a Dearborn attorney who arranges surrogacy contracts
between women willing to carry a child and couples unable to
conceive, said he expected Gillis' ruling to be appealed.
   Keane said he is serving about 200 couples with surrogate
contracts enacted in states such as New York and Nevada that allow
surrogate parenting for pay.
   Typically, infertile couples pay $10,000 to be matched with a
would-be mother. They pay another $10,000 to the woman who agrees to
be artificially inseminated, carry the child, then give up custody.

   A long-range, high-altitude helium
balloon blown 500 miles off course from California crashed near this
southern Utah town Monday, seriously injuring two men aboard.
   The balloon, registered to Scorpion Productions of Perris,
Calif., took off Sunday evening from a parking lot near Disneyland
in Orange County, Calif., authorities said.
   The two friends had planned to take an aerial tour of the Los
Angeles basin, said Hajnal Crieg, co-owner of the four-passenger,
3,500-cubic-foot balloon.
   ``But a storm came in. You can't really control a helium balloon,
so they went wherever the wind takes them,'' she said. The trip
ended about 500 air miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``They were just on an overnight trip,'' Crieg said.
   The balloon wreckage was spotted about 10:20 a.m. in rugged,
mountainous terrain about five miles south of Circleville, said Utah
Civil Air Patrol spokesman Jerry Wellman.
   The California men, pilot Ron Martin, 46, of Long Beach, and
Scott Hendricks, 30, of Chino, were taken to Garfield Memorial
Hospital.
   Hendricks was in critical condition with severe back injuries and
a possible broken ankle. Martin was in serious condition with back
injuries and a dislocated shoulder, said hospital administrator
Wayne Ross. Ross said Hendricks was taken by ambulance to a Salt
Lake City hospital, about 200 miles to the north, Monday afternoon.

   A stubborn fire at a warehouse destroyed at least
340,000 frozen turkeys and millions of pounds of crab, cauliflower
and other foods.
   The overnight fire, which was brought under control Monday
afternoon, was inside thick walls filled with dry,
turn-of-the-century sawdust that helped insulate the Rainier Cold
Storage, said Fire Chief Claude Harris.
   About 80 people had to be evacuated from the plant when ammonia
gas, used in the warehouse's refrigeration, was released.
   The residents were moved back to their homes after utility
services were restored, said Lt. Herb Brooks. Electricity and gas
lines had been shut off for safety, he said.
   Five firefighters were injured slightly in the blaze and a sixth
was hospitalized, Harris said. The cause of the fire was being
investigated.
   Deputy Fire Chief Steve Bailey said it may have started in the
building's electrical system. ``We first received a call of an
electrical problem,'' he said.
   One wall collapsed from the heat and water. Harris said pumping
water into the 4-foot-wide walls was necessary to extinguish the
smoldering blaze, but dangerous because the weight of the water
could cause the walls to collapse.
   At least some walls on the inside of the building, which was
built before 1910 as a brewery for Rainier Brewing Co., had fallen
in, and the roof collapsed.
   ``There was 13 million pounds of food in this building,'' said
Bud Horton, owner of Meats, Inc., and crab was a big part of the
loss. He said he had lost 40,000 pounds of turkeys and 20,000 pounds
of fish, and another broker had lost 300,000 pounds of turkeys.
   Bill Butler, office manager for Rainier Cold Storage, said the
facility rented space to many food brokers. He said he did not know
how extensive losses would be, or whether there was insurance
coverage.
   Mike Roberts, Rainier Cold Storage vice president of marketing
and warehousing, estimated the building's value at $5 million,
adding that the 22-room structure housed about 13 million pounds of
fruits, vegetables, meats and seafood. He said the value of the
frozen foods ranged from 50 cents a pound to $8 a pound.

<TEXT>
   The largest home and car insurer in
California, State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., said Monday it has
stopped writing new auto policies because of chaos surrounding
rate-slashing Proposition 103.
   State Farm Mutual will continue to carry and renew policies for
its more than 3 million auto insurance customers, the company
announced Monday.
   But new applications will be referred to an affiliated company
that has higher rates, thus shielding the company from some of the
cuts that would be imposed by Proposition 103.
   In California, Proposition 103's author, Harvey Rosenfield,
denounced the plan to switch new customers to a higher-priced
affiliate as an improper attempt to circumvent the measure.
   ``They can't get away with it,'' Rosenfield said.
   The affiliate, State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., charges 20
percent to 60 percent more for car insurance than does State Farm
Mutual because State Farm Fire insures higher-risk drivers rejected
by its affiliate, spokesman Jim Stahly said from the companies'
Bloomington, Ill., headquarters.
   State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. has about 300,000 auto policies
in California and also is the state's biggest homeowners' insurance
carrier.
   Implementation of Proposition 103, approved by voters last week,
was blocked by the California Supreme Court. But uncertainty in the
industry has already prompted a number of companies to either stop
writing insurance or to consider a halt.
   Proposition 103 orders sweeping changes of the insurance
industry, including a 20 percent rate cut below November 1987 rates
for auto, home and commercial insurance.
   In Massachusetts on Monday, Allstate Insurance Co. announced it
is leaving that state because of financial losses and frustration
over the regulatory climate.
   Kevin Sullivan, director of Allstate's Group Auto division, said
Allstate has lost $115 million in Massachusetts in five years.
   ``We have no intention to return,'' Sullivan said, making
Allstate the third major insurer to abandon Massachusetts.
   Allstate will not renew its license when it expires on June 30.
But until then, Allstate will sell new policies and follow through
on policies until they expire, he said.
   State Farm made the switch concerning its California business
both to reduce its continuing losses on car insurance and to have a
vehicle to sell insurance to drivers whose own companies may quit
the state, Stahly said.
   ``Our underwriting loss was $76 for each car insured in
California during 1987, and we're losing substantially more during
1988,'' the company said in a news release, adding that escalating
future losses are a ``near certainty.''
   Additional losses could reach $1.3 million in auto insurance
premium income each day for the next year under Proposition 103,
officials said.
   State Farm Mutual owns State Farm Fire. Together, the companies'
California business includes more than 3 million auto policies, 1.2
million homeowner policies and 420,000 business liability customers.

   The PLO's parliament-in-exile today takes
up a historic draft declaration approved by its leadership that
implicitly recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   Several conference sources said they expected up to 85 percent of
the 450 members of the Palestine National Council to endorse the
document. The declaration sets out a new political strategy by
endorsing U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 _ which recognizes
Israel's right to exist _ thus satisfying one of Washington's key
preconditions for dealing with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   On Tuesday, the council is expected to end its extraordinary
four-day meeting with a declaration of independence for the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have for 11 months been
revolting against Israel's 21-year occupation.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc has
won the support of two ultra-Orthodox parties, apparently enabling
it to form a governing coalition that will exclude Israel's other
dominant party _ Labor.
   The price of the religious parties' endorsement, secured late
Sunday, was a promise to amend Israel's controversial ``Who is a
Jew'' law so Orthodox rabbis have exlusive rights to approve
conversions to Judaism. Most American Jews, who like most Israelis
are not Orthodox, fiercely oppose the amendment.
   President Chaim Herzog was expected to give Likud the go-ahead
today to form a new government after meeting with leaders of the
hard-line party and its left-leaning rival, Labor. The two parties
have governed Israel since deadlocked 1984 elections, and
inconclusive Nov. 1 elections gave Likud 40 seats in the 120-member
parliament and Labor 39.

   The environmental community is looking to
President-elect George Bush to take action early next year to back
up his campaign-trail claim to be an environmentalist.
   ``Proclaiming himself an environmentalist is not enough,'' says
Robert SanGeorge, the National Audubon Society's vice president for
public affairs. ``Now is the time for action. He's got a lot to
prove.''
   Shortly after getting the Republican nomination, Bush moved to
stake out the green ground, proclaiming ``I am an environmentalist''
and putting Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis on the defensive with
ads about the filthy waters of Boston Harbor. Bush pledged action on
a variety of fronts, from convening an international conference on
global warming to protecting this nation's disappearing wetlands and
cleaning up its polluted air.

   President-elect George Bush and Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle may be more than just running mates. A
genealogist who specializes in the lineage of presidents says Bush
and Quayle are 10th cousins once removed.
   The two are also related to Abraham Lincoln, and the man thought
to be Marilyn Monroe's father, said Gary Boyd Roberts, a genealogist
at the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston.
   Bush, a Yankee, and Quayle, from a wealthy Indiana newspaper
publishing family, both have 17th century roots in New England,
Roberts said. Roberts has spent almost a decade researching Bush's
ancestry, which will be included in his upcoming book on
presidential lineage, timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary
of George Washington's inauguration April 30.

   As he crosses into middle age, the heir to the British throne,
who has no constitutionally defined job, has carved his own role _
as crusader for the underprivileged and protector of the environment.
   On the eve of the prince's birthday, one of his close associates,

   Defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis, facing an uneasy
transition back to the Massachusetts Statehouse, acknowledged Monday
that his state has fiscal problems but insisted they're not as bad
as George Bush said they were.
   In a scene far removed from the cheering rallies of the
presidential campaign, the governor fielded questions from his
home-state press on issues ranging from taxes to a new car for the
lieutenant governor.
   ``We face major challenges,'' Dukakis acknowledged at a jammed
Beacon Hill news conference. But he disagreed with critics who say
the state faces a ``fiscal crisis'' and denied that problems had
worsened at home because of his 20-month presidential campaign.
   As he did on the campaign trail, Dukakis refused to rule out new
state taxes. But he promised to balance the current $11.6 billion
state budget when the fiscal year ends next June.

<HEAD>Joanna Kerns Writes Script for `Growing Pains'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The producers of ABC's ``Growing Pains'' could
reasonably have expected Joanna Kerns to pitch stories featuring her
own character when she asked to write an episode.
   Kerns stars as Maggie Seaver, a television anchorwoman who's
married to psychiatrist Jason Seaver, played by Alan Thicke.
   ``I think they expected Maggie stories,'' she said. ``We pitched
them six stories, none of them about Maggie.''
   This Wednesday's episode, co-written by Kerns and her writng
partner Becky Ayers, revolves around Jason's mother, played by Jane
Powell, and the crisis that arises when she announces she's
remarrying.
   ``We got the idea from a few different things,'' said Kerns.
``I'm single and dating, and it's difficult to date with a child who
has set ideas about who you should be with. We applied that to
Jason, a psychiatrist, who should know better. When his mother says
she's getting married, how does he react? Like a grownup, or a
5-year-old?
   ``It challenges the expectations that children have of their
parents. Children tend to believe parents are around just to serve
them. It's about letting go. Even if you're 40 years old, you have
to let go.''
   Jason's mother has been referred to in the show, but she has
never appeared before. ``In one episode she stops by to pick up the
kids,'' said Kerns. ``You hear her honking the horn, then screeching
tires as she pulls away. That gave us the idea she was a little more
daring than Jason.''
   Kerns and Ayers met about eight years ago when their children
were in nursery school together. Their first writing project was an
unproduced movie script called ``Let It Rain,'' which they said was
similar to ``Mr. Mom,'' the hit movie that came two years later.
   They also collaborated on another script, ``American Pie,'' which
has been optioned as a television movie.
   Ayers, who is married to actor Robert Rockwell, has written
another script for ``Growing Pains'' on her own. This one is about
Maggie. ``I wanted to write about the stress of being a working
mother,'' said Ayers. She had once sold a script to ``Flo,'' but the
series was canceled before it could be produced.
   Working alone, Kerns has written a movie script called
``Freestyle'' that tells of two teen-age sisters competing to go to
the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow _ which the United States
ultimately boycotted because of the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan. That script is also under option by a studio.
   ``The younger sister thinks that if she can win a spot on the
team she'll be loved by her father,'' said Kerns. ``The sisters wind
up competing against each other.''
   The story is partly autobiographical. Kerns' older sister is
Donna de Varona, who won two Olympic swimming gold medals in 1964.
Kerns was a gymnast who participated in the 1968 Olympic trials, but
placed 14th out of the 28 vying for the team.
   ``It was a sport I was too tall for,'' said the actress, who at
5-foot-8{ was a foot taller than most of her competitors. ``I really
wrote the story because it took me years to give myself any
validation as an athlete. My expectations for myself were so high.
When I didn't make the team I thought I had failed. My friends say I
should call the script `I Never Swam for My Father.'''
   Despite being a star of ``Growing Pains,'' Kerns found it tough
breaking in as a writer.
   ``If they don't know you as a writer, your script may or may not
get read,'' she said. ``I even had trouble getting my own agents to
read my scripts. I was just another actress who wanted to write. I
think when a writer makes a breakthrough, a closet full of rejected
scripts falls out.''
   Kerns also co-stars with Gary Cole (``Midnight Caller'') in an
NBC movie with a working title of ``Daddy'' scheduled to air in
January.

<HEAD>On Top of War, Lebanon is Hit with Toxic Waste Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ravaged by civil war for 13 years, Lebanon
now has been hit by the dumping of poisonous chemical waste from
Western Europe.
   At least 2,400 tons of Italian chemical waste, which Lebanese
officials said was toxic and dangerous, were discovered last May in
the mountains of Kesrouan province in the Christian heartland about
20 miles north of Beirut.
   That discovery forced the cancellation of another shipment of
30,000 tons of Italian waste destined for Lebanon, Justice Ministry
sources reported.
   The incident is one of several that have recently surfaced in
African, Middle Eastern and Latin American countries where Western
Europe has unloaded its industrial waste, often passed off as
innocent material, because of the high cost of toxic-waste disposal
at home.
   Amid an outcry for tighter controls, several countries have
blocked ships carrying toxic waste from entering their harbors,
leaving the vessels to roam the seas looking for a place to unload
their hazardous cargoes.
   Lebanon's leftist newspapers and radio stations accused the
Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, of allowing the
industrial waste to be brought into the country through the port
they control in Beirut harbor.
   They claim the militia was paid $10 million to dump the waste and
alleged there was an ``Israeli connection.''
   Lebanon has numerous ports run by Moslem and Christian militias
along its Mediterranean coast through which they ship in goods and
weapons.
   The Christian militia has denied involvement in the toxic waste
affairs and diplomats don't believe it was. Officials of the
London-based International Maritime Bureau recently said the
Lebanese Forces have helped them uncover shipping frauds.
   But Beirut's leftist As-Safir newspaper published letters and
documents purporting to prove the militia's involvement. It did not
say who provided the documents.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that former President Amin Gemayel, whose term
expired Sept. 23, deliberately leaked the story to polish up his
image and discredit the militia.
   The Lebanese Forces and Gemayel's Katayeb militia at the time
were battling for dominance of the 800,000-member Maronite Catholic
community, Lebanon's most powerful Christian sect. Since Gemayel
stepped down, the Lebanese Forces have won.
   ``The case was blown up out of proportion, in typical Lebanese
fashion. I don't believe the Lebanese Forces imported the stuff,''
the diplomat said.
   ``Moslem leaders fanned the flames of the scandal, hoping it
would touch off a confrontation between the Christian rivals.''
   ``What happened was a stupid mistake which resulted from
ignorance,'' said Caesar Nasr, head of the Lebanese Forces' foreign
relations department.
   The manifest of the Czechoslovak freighter Radhost, which carried
the waste in October, 1987, to the Lebanese Forces' port, known as
the Fifth Basin, listed the cargo as ``chemical residue and
agricultural products.''
   Nasr said that the militia's ``customs officers'' at the Fifth
Basin ``didn't have the scientific background to realize the
significance of industrial residue.''
   ``Since there's no law forbidding the entry of industrial residue
into Lebanon, they allowed the barrels in,'' he added. He claimed
that ``unscrupulous Lebanese merchants'' brought the waste in.
   Joseph Hashem, Lebanon's health minister at the time, declared
that the waste was poisonous and harmful. Nasr said the militia
later moved the waste back to the Fifth Basin.
   Attilio Massimo Iannucci, first secretary at Italy's Embassy in
Beirut, said the drums contain solvents, paint and plastics products.
   ``It's very dirty because it's the residue of chemical waste .. .
but it's not toxic, explosive or radioactive,'' he added.
   Nonetheless, the Italian authorities sent a 16-man team of
specialists to handle the waste. They spent 50 days repacking it
into 10,000 new drums and 15 containers brought from Italy.
   Toxic waste from Italy has turned up in several countries and the
government in Rome has said it will ban toxic waste shipments to the
Third World.
   Asked why Italy was going to such lengths to rid Lebanon of the
waste, Iannucci said it was part of Italy's ``technical assistance''
program.
   ``Lebanon was facing a problem without the means to solve it .. .
so we offered to help,'' he said. ``Also, these products came from
Italy.''
   Iannucci added that the chemicals were brought to Lebanon after
the Jelly Wax Co. of Milan, a paraffin manufacturer that moved into
the lucrative toxic waste disposal business, made a deal with a
Lebanese company known as Adonis. Lebanese officials said Adonis was
a ``fictitious company.''
   Iannucci said Adonis undertook to destroy the chemicals for a
``huge sum of money'' to be paid after disposal.
   ``Instead, they dumped it in Lebanon and presented an official
document claiming it had been disposed of to get the money.'' The
document proved to be forged.
   Roger Haddad, director of maritime operations with the Nassar
Shipping Co., and four other Christian businessmen linked to Adonis
were arrested on charges of importing toxic waste that endangered
lives. They were later released on bail.
   A warrant has also been issued for Armand Nassar, owner of the
shipping company and a relative of Haddad. Nassar, identified as the
mastermind of the deal, fled Lebanon earlier this year.

   Evening campfires in the nomads'
camelhide tents dance to a nightly staccato of gunfire from warring
rebels and communist government soldiers on theWriter=
   KAN desert plain outside
this ancient provincial capital.
   Turbaned men oblivious to the shots face southwest toward the
Moslem holy city of Mecca to begin their evening prayer. Women in
voluminous layers of colored cloth move about nearby.
   The primitive nomad tribes have for centuries encamped near
Kandahar's satellite village of Argandab. Now, Soviet jets scream
overhead.
   Afghanistan's war goes on around them and sometimes engulfs them.
   Less than a mile from the nomads' camp, Moslem rebels, blast away
at government military posts with recoilless rifles,
rocket-propelled grenade launchers and light and heavy machine guns.
   The army's artillery is an even match, but government troops have
an advantaggovernment hold Kandahar, a key
city, once the Soviets withdraw from Afghanistan. They are committed
to do so by February.
   In Argandab, where civilians far outnumber rebels, jets swept one
recent day over the main bazaar, levelling a portion of it, killing
nine people and wounding 80 others.
   A squat man with a gray beard said, ``When I wake up in the
morning until I go to sleep, I'm not sure about my life, that I will
be alive five minutes from now because of the war.''
   The old man, wrapped in a blanket, said he lived in Kandahar,
once the capital of all Afghanistan.
   Through the fine dust that hangs over the city, the pale blue
dome of the Kalqi Sharif mosque can be seen from a distance. The
mosque, which embodies the Islamic tenets propelling the rebel
mujahedeen in their fight sits opposite the governor's home, a
stronghold of the Soviet-backed government.
   The western entrance to the city is deserted but for the army and
militia, tanks and trucks. Civilians are not seen except at the
bazaar at Shaheedan Chowk, a pillared monument honoring Afghans
killed fighting the British more than a century ago.
   Kandahar, known as the city of kings, is the birthplace of
generations of Afghan royalty. The ornate tomb of Ahmad Shah
Durrani, the grandfather of Afghanistan's exiled King Zahir Shah, is
a vernerated site of monarchists who are in the majority around
Kandahar, both among the mujahedeen and civilians.
   The rubble of blasted buildings chokes the streets, forcing
motorized rickshaws and horse drawn ``tonga'' carriages to steer an
obstacle course through the bazaar.
   Gul Lalai, a commander of the rebel National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, said the bulk of the damage near Herat Gate on the
western edge of Kandahar occurred when fighter jets aiming at
guerrilla positions in a nearby suburb missed their mark.
   Evidence that the guerrillas have operated extensively in the
city for years is the heavy tank-fire damage to the mud homes and
shops.
   About 50,000 people remain in Kandahar compared to a prewar
population of about 200,000, making it second only in size to Kabul,
Afghanistan's capital.
   Old men, women and children crowd daily into the bazaar before it
closes at 2 p.m.
   The free access of women and children is used by mujahedeen who
employ youngsters to bring supplies to rebel bases from the city.
   One of the young recruits, Gul Mohammad, said he lost his mother,
two younger sisters and a brother when a tank round hit his home in
Kandahar two years ago. He was 9 years old at the time.
   Police once stopped him and a friend carrying turbans, sandals
and ``important letters'' to rebels, he said. ``When they captured
me they beat me up. Even they broke my head.''
   Mohammad said he spent almost a year in Kandahar prison.
   ``Everyday for questioning they brought us to a room full of
water and made us lie down and they beat us,'' he said.
   ``I'm not afraid of anything,'' he boasted. But mujahedeen said
his forays into the city were finished.

<HEAD>Spain's Socialist Government and Labor on Verge of Split</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With unemployment the highest in Western
Europe, Spain's Socialist government and labor unions, longtime
allies, are on the verge of a serious split.
   When leaders of Spain's 100-year-old General Workers Union called
recently for a nationwide strike to protest government economic
austerity policies, they took what many saw as the final step toward
a divorce from the governing Spanish Socialist Workers Party and the
46-year-old Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   The union and its erstwhile rival, the Communist-oriented Workers
Commissions, have set a 24-hour nationwide strike for Dec. 14.
   The aim of both unions is to force Gonzalez, a former labor
lawyer, to shift his support to labor and drop policies favoring
only moderate wage hikes and low inflation as the way to high
economic growth.
   Labor Minister Manuel Chaves' decision to create a youth job
corps was the last straw for the unions, who claim the low wages
proposed in the plan will take jobs away from older workers at a
time when the unemployment rate has soared to 18.8 percent.
   The youth plan calls for the creation of up to to 800,000 jobs
for unemployed youths 16 to 25 years old over the next three years
through low wages and tax credits for businesses who must provide
training during their six-to-18 month contracts.
   At least 45 percent of those in the 16-25 age group are
unemployed and many have never held a job.
   Apolinar Rodriguez, member of the General Workers Union executive
committee, said the program ``foments inequities among workers since
youths hired under the plan will be making less than the minimum
legal wage'' _ the equivalent of $376 a month for those aged 18 to
25 _ ``and will be excluded from collective bargaining agreements.''
   Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga reponded, however, that the
unions may find the majority of Spaniards do not share their
disapproval of the youth jobs program.
   Even before the jobs plan conflict, the unions had clashed with
the Gonzalez government over wage agreements.
   Union leaders have denounced the government's request that
employers reject demands for immediate wage increases until after
the first of the year, despite a recent rise in inflation to 5
percent, two points above the 1988 government target.
   Nicolas Redondo, secretary general of the General Workers Union,
helped propel Gonzalez to the top of the Socialist party during the
bitter years of the opposition to the authoritarian regime of Gen.
Francisco Franco. But Redondo quit his Parliament seat in 1987 to
protest a budget he viewed as anti-labor.
   ``The strikes are not just about money, but about ideology,''
Redondo said recently. ``The economic policies of this government,
instead of helping workers, lean clearly to the right. It should
realize it cannot remain in power very long with just the support of
businessmen and bankers.''
   The Spanish Confederation of Employers has given its full support
to the youth plan and backs continued government calls for moderate
wages.
   The economic policies criticized by the unions have helped end a
decade of economic stagnation in Spain and spurred a boom that has
fueled a 5 percent annual growth, the highest in Western Europe, for
the past two years.
   A top Labor Ministry official, Alvaro Espina, has criticized the
unions' opposition to the jobs plan, saying they appear more
interested in politics than helping youths get jobs.
   Espina lamented the growing separation between the unions and the
Socialist administration ``which diminishes their (the unions') role
in society, which is absolutely necessary and which should be
reinforced.''
   Only 10 percent of Spain's active work force belongs to a union,
according to Labor Ministry statistics, and the government appears
confident of public support for its jobs plan.
   A government poll recently indicated that 85 percent of those
surveyed believed the administration's top priority should be
creating jobs for youths.
   An additional 77 percent said they preferred that the government
create the jobs through incentives to businesses rather than
directly hand out unemployment pay.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Mix equal parts of stubbornness, bureaucracy and
economics. The reaction can be explosive. In the case of Elmer Fike
and the Environmental Protection Agency, it blew up into one of the
worst toxic waste sites in America.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<BYLINE>By JULES LOH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NITRO, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elmer Fike was out of town the day the
federal government, not for the first time, cited his chemical plant
for ``recognized hazards...likely to cause death or physical harm to
employees.''
   Fike happened to be in Chicago picking up a National Safety
Council award for his ``outstanding commitment to safety,'' as
demonstrated by his zeal in promoting motorcycle helmets.
   Ironies abound in the decade-long contest between Elmer Fike and
the federal government.
   Right now, Environmental Protection Agency workers wearing moon
suits are prowling around 12 acres of rusted pipes and vats and
tanks of Fike's abandoned plant, cleaning up what they consider one
of the worst toxic waste sites in the nation.
   Meanwhile, Fike, wearing stained trousers and a sweater, is
working nearby among beakers and test tubes and pipets in a house
trailer lab, still brewing chemicals.
   ``The EPA put me out of business,'' he was saying the other day,
without apparent bitterness.
   According to Harold Yates, an EPA spokesman, there may be a grain
of truth in that.
   ``I feel sorry for Elmer Fike,'' he says. ``Fike sort of fell
through the cracks. What he was doing, an operation his size, well,
he really couldn't afford to implement the required regulations.''
   Elmer Fike's operation, which employed 75 people, entailed using
hazardous materials to make products in small volume that large
chemical companies deemed unprofitable and too troublesome to make
themselves.
   He's still doing it, as a ``consultant'' for somebody else.
   ``I used ways that nobody else used,'' Fike says. ``I innovated.
I know how to handle hazardous material, but I am, I realize, a
non-conformist.''
   For their part, the residents of Nitro, who number 8,000, seem
ambivalent about Fike's fight.
   At the Nitro Lounge, a gathering place for workers in West
Virginia's ``Chemical Valley,'' who know the risks, most say they
would never have worked for Fike even though jobs in this state are
scarce.
   But they also call the $13 million government cleanup of Fike's
old plant a boondoggle. When the EPA called for evacuating one-third
of the townspeople while they destroyed a cylinder of a lethal
chemical they found at the plant, many didn't leave.
   ``Chemicals are our livelihood,'' says Bill Goff. ``We don't like
to announce to the world that they can kill you, even though they
can.''
   Goff is a 35-year old native of the valley who works at Vimasco
Corp., a paint manufacturer separated from the Fike cleanup site by
a chain-link fence, corroded.
   ``I needed a job,'' Goff says, ``so I took the only one I could
get. I cleaned out railroad tank cars. I would never do it again.''
   One day his rubber boots sunk through the spongy crust of asphalt
residue in the bottom of a tank car. The goo acted like chemical
quicksand and sucked him down. He had to be hauled out. The hair on
his legs has never grown back. Other exposures have caused itchy
skin rashes when he goes in the sun.
   Elmer Fike will tell you that he operated his plant for nearly 30
years without accident or serious injury. But Nitro firemen will
tell you that they once hauled Fike himself out of his plant,
unconscious, with his hair on fire.
   Elmer Fike is a 70-year old man with eyes the color of cobalt. He
earned his chemical engineering degree at Iowa State University and
was offered work at Monsanto Co. in Nitro.
   To find Nitro, you drive west out of Charleston along the Kanawha
River, past a string of 20 chemical plants and after 15 miles,
especially on a rainy day, you likely will smell it.
   The town was built on riverbank farmland in 1918 to make
munitions for World War I. It was named for nitrocellulose,
smokeless gunpowder. It grew overnight to 25,000 people, and was as
quickly abandoned when the war ended, leaving behind thick concrete
bunkers which remain scattered about, and great piles of sulphur
which, old timers testify, stank even then.
   In 1974 the Nitro Business and Professional Association passed a
resolution asking the governor to keep his air polution control
commissioner from talking about how Nitro smells. Bad for business.

   ``Nitro's low-level emissions,'' the resolution said, voicing the
hometown opinion which still prevails, ``are less offensive to
sensitive nostrils than a freshly fertilized farm.''
   Since then, industries have made remarkable deodorant progress,
but even fresh manure doesn't make your eyes smart. Residents across
from Fike's plant complained to the EPA that whatever was wafting
their way made the paint peel off their houses.
   ``Most don't complain,'' says Sharon Pfost, who writes training
programs for Union Carbide Co. ``That's why they make $15 an hour.''
   Elmer Fike, after 12 years with Monsanto, opened his own plant in
one of those World War I bunkers and built from there. By the
mid-1970s he had made quite a name for himself in West Virginia.
   He headed a committee fighting for school textbooks that
reflected ``traditional values and free enterprise,'' and became
president of the West Virginia Safety Council.
   He also was in the news because of a series of explosions and
fires at his plant in 1976. One was caused by rainwater leaking
through one of those old bunkers onto a ton of sodium waste. Instant
combustion. They had to herd all the schoolchildren home because of
the choking smoke blowing all over town for 12 hours.
   But mainly Elmer Fike drew attention as an uncompromising foe of
what he considered wrongheaded government regulations.
   He was outspoken against the Water Pollution Control Bill and the
Toxic Substance Control Act, calling it, by its acronym, the
Terminate Small Companies Act.
   He took several trips to Washington to argue his points and was
noticed by a network news program.
   ``I said, sure, come on down and look over my operation. They
sent a crew down. I showed them everything.
   ``Before the show came on the air we had a meeting of the
Chemical Manufacturers Association. I told everybody there to be
sure and watch the program. I guess that was a mistake.
   ``Here came Lesley Stahl on the TV screen and she said, `Now we
take you to the messiest place we've ever been.' And that was the
nicest thing she had to say about me for the rest of the program.
   ``Within a week I had four government agents on my back. Worse,
the industry began to desert me. I had become a pariah. They all
want to keep their distance from EPA, so they turned their backs on
me. I began to lose customers I had had for years.
   ``I was told I had contaminated the soil, the ground water, the
air. They told me to dig down 20 feet, test the soil, incinerate
some stuff, haul it off, all that kind of crap. It would have cost
multimillions of dollars. So I said I wouldn't do it.
   ``A month later I was on the Superfund list. That was the kiss of
death. I lost all my customers, what few I had left. I laid
everybody off. That was in 1982.''
   ``Fike said he'd clean up the operation,'' says the EPA's Yates.
``It is our policy not to interfere with an operating business.
We're sensitive to unemployment, to what closing a business will do
to a town. Moreover, if the violator will clean it up himself it
will save the government money.
   ``Since 1982, Fike has chosen to do nothing.
   ``On June 11 of this year the mayor of Nitro informed us that the
site had been abandoned. We had no choice but to act.''
   The abandonment, Yates explains, moved the site from the
``remedial'' category, meaning the owner was endeavoring to clean it
up himself, to the ``removal'' category, meaning it was an
``immediate and substantial'' threat to public safety.
   ``What we had,'' Yates says, ``was a screaming emergency.''
   So the EPA people moved in with their moon suits. After
destroying that lethal cylinder of hydrogen cyanide, they went on to
pack more than 5,000 rusted drums of chemicals into new drums to be
identified and hauled away.
   Now their main concern is to empty a railroad tank car which Fike
used as a storage tank for 9,000 gallons of methyl mercaptan, a
toxic and flammable chemical with a skunk odor. The car, its wheels
removed, sits on a slab and all its drainpipes are corroded.
   ``If that stuff were released into the air,'' Yates says, ``you
would smell it in Washington, D.C.
   ``The biggest mistake Elmer Fike made is that he was too honest
and forthright. I mean it. The average person would have cashed in
in 1982, hid his assets and run like hell. A lot of them did.
   ``He chose to stand his ground and fight for his principles. He's
stubborn that way, that's all.
   ``But in the end he lost.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
five years ago to protect a small Oregon town from the flash floods
that had caused so much death and destruction in the past. But from
the start the Willow Creek Dam has been leaking. To make matters
worse, there is new evidence that chemicals in the water are eroding
the concrete structure. Residents of Heppner are demanding that
something be done. But what?

   ``The...torrent came at 5:30 o'clock when
most of the inhabitants were at their evening meal. All were taken
so suddenly...that nothing could be done to save those who were
caught in the rushing waters. Homes, stores, and all buildings in
the principal portion of the town were torn loose and driven
onward.''
   That was a haunting eyewitness account of a 1903 flash flood that
sent the swollen waters of Willow Creek coursing through this
Eastern Oregon community.
   Today residents wonder if it could happen again.
   The 5-year-old Willow Creek Dam looms 170 feet over the town of
1,375, mostly farmers, ranchers and lumbermen. That the dam leaks
has been obvious from the beginning. Recent reports that the dam
also may be eroding have intensified the uneasiness on Main Street.
   Experts say oxygen depletion in the nutrient-rich reservoir has
left pockets of chemicals corrosive enough to dissolve the concrete
dam.
   Roughly one-fifth of Heppner's population _ some 250 people _
died in the 1903 deluge, which is listed in the Guinness Book of
World Records as the worst disaster of its kind measured by per
capita loss of life.
   Former Mayor Cliff Green operates the hardware store where local
heroes Bruce Kelly and Leslie Matlock stole a pair of wire cutters
so they could cut fences and ride cross-country to warn downstream
neighbors of the encroaching floodwaters. Their historic ride saved
hundreds of residents in Lexington and Ione.
   A system of sirens stands ready to warn townspeople in the event
of a flash flood today.
   But no warning could prepare them for the worst-case scenario. A
breach in the Willow Creek Dam could inundate the town with 18
million tons of water.
   The dam has been a touchy subject among residents since before it
was built.
   Opponents claimed the dam was unnecessary. Supporters then and
now said they had little choice.
   ``Basically, we built the dam to save Main Street from government
regulations, not from water,'' says Green, whose bright yellow lapel
button reads, ``Best Little Dam By a Townsite.''
   Heppner has a history of flash floods, caused by the
thunderstorms locals call ``waterspouts.''
   The most recent, in 1971, destroyed several homes and prompted
the Federal Emergency Management Agency to designate the downtown
area as a flood plain.
   FEMA spokesman Chuck Steele of Seattle said statistics showed the
town faced a 1 percent chance of a catastrophic flood in any given
year, a 26 percent chance of such a disaster within an average
30-year mortgage cycle, and a 67 percent chance of a major flood
within 100 years.
   Heppner is one of 258 communities nationwide built in flood
plains as defined by the Flood Insurance Act of 1968, Steele says.
   The designation requires residents to carry flood insurance and
also bans any federally backed construction loans unless measures
are taken to prevent future flooding.
   In Heppner, it meant the town had to be rebuilt on higher ground
or protected by a flood control dam.
   Green was one of those opposed to the dam, but he finally
resigned himself to the idea. What else was the town to do?
   ``Some people said, `By God, they can't make you do something
like that,''' Green recalls. ``But they just didn't understand there
wasn't any other choice.''
   Townspeople were bitterly divided by the issue. But in 1981, it
finally was approved by a vote of 297-272.
   A subsequent U.S. Army Corps of Engineers feasibility study
showed the cost of the project _ $34.7 million _ outweighed the
benefits. But Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., pressed for the dam,
citing its potential to save lives.

   Finally, the corps proceeded.
   The decision to build the dam was vindicated before construction
was completed, Green says. In 1982, fire destroyed the Heppner Post
Office, the store next door and a vacant building near the center of
town. None could have been rebuilt under the FEMA restriction.
   Ed Hiemstra remains one of the most outspoken opponents of the
Willow Creek Dam. From his back yard, he has a clear view of the
dam's wet face.
   ``We can see it's disintegrating, but they're not telling us
anything,'' he complains. ``They were looking for a sparsely settled
area so they could experiment with this new type of dam, and now
we're stuck with it.''
   It was the first in the world to employ a quick and inexpensive
construction technique in which concrete is built up in layers like
a cake instead of molded and slabbed.
   Twenty dams have been built since the roller compacted concrete
construction (RCC) method was pioneered at Willow Creek. And
engineers are still perfecting the technique.
   As Ronnie M. Lemons wrote in the October 1988 issue of ``Civil
Engineering'' magazine, ``Even with the technology as it exists
today, RCC dams leak...As yet there is no consensus on how to stop
those leaks.''
   When it first was filled in 1983, the Willow Creek Dam leaked
nearly 3,000 gallons a minute. A $2 million grouting project in 1984
reduced the leakage by 95 percent.
   A greater problem than leaking, however, may be the corrosion of
the dam from within.
   In 1984, a study by environmental engineer William Funk of the
Washington State University Water Research Center predicted water
quality problems at Willow Creek.
   With experience in other cattle and sheep-feeding areas, Funk
could predict a watershed rich with the kind of nutrients that can
destroy concrete. While not opposed to the dam, he said its
construction weighed heavily on his mind.
   ``I expected to see a real mess there,'' he says.
   Corps scientists were surprised to find water quality
deteriorating more rapidly and dramatically than Funk had
anticipated. After four years of study, they still are not sure what
it all means.
   ``We're not alarmed, but we are concerned,'' says Doug Larson, a
lake scientist who has spent years studying the waters behind Willow
Creek Dam.
   ``We have all the compounds present that can deteriorate
concrete. We just don't know how intense they are. The big question
is: How quickly is this happening?''
   He says the answers are at least eight months away. Consultants
are studying the geochemical processes occurring in the dam and the
reservoir, while others are analyzing the presence of volatile
methane gases and the effect of concrete-corroding acids.
   ``The corps' reputation and future is on the line,'' says Cliff
Green. ``They can't say, `You've got a problem and it may break _
send us a post card.' They have to do something.''
   David Sykes, publisher of the Gazette-Times newspaper, says the
corps already has lost credibility among the residents of Heppner.
   In an angry editorial, Sykes demanded an independent analysis of
the dam's safety.
   ``We need more than a dose of the corps' publicity machine,''
Sykes wrote. ``We need some action, to tell the truth, and it should
come from our elected representatives.
   ``Word is out that the Willow Creek Dam is sick. The Corps of
Engineers says everything is fine. But we, the people of Heppner,
need a second opinion.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ African voodoo rituals blend with Roman
Catholicism and Jimmy Swaggart-style Pentacostalism in Brazil.
Officials estimate that 90 million of Brazil's 144 million people
practice some form of spiritism, but many of them list their
``official'' religion as Catholic.

<TEXT>
   In a packed meeting hall on Rio's
poor North Side, a Pentecostal preacher screams the names of African
voodoo gods as scores of ``possessed'' followers surge forward to be
exorcized.
   At a nearby Roman Catholic church, a priest says Mass as the
congregation sways to the throbbing beat of the ``atabaques,'' the
traditional wooden drums used in Candomble spirit rituals.
   Persecuted for years, Afro-Brazilian spirit cults such as
Candomble, Umbanda and Macumba today are regarded as serious rivals
to Christianity in Brazil, the world's largest Roman Catholic
country.
   Catholics and Protestants are striving to win converts among the
tens of millions of spirit worshipers.
   ``We want to intensify the religious dialogue with our brothers
in Candomble and Umbanda. We have more things in common than
divergencies,'' says the Rev. Antonio Aparecido da Silva, a leader
of the Catholic Church's Association of Black Pastoral Agents.
   On paper, Roman Catholicism is by far Brazil's dominant religion,
brought by Portuguese settlers 400 years ago.
   But millions also follow cults descended from Yoruba and Bantu
religions originally practiced by African slaves. Over the
centuries, the cults picked up elements of Roman Catholicism, native
Indian faiths, European witchcraft and Kardec spiritism and became
uniquely Brazilian.
   The Christian Research Institute in Sao Paulo estimates that 90
million of Brazil's 144 million people practice some form of
spiritism, although many still give their ``official'' religion as
Roman Catholic.
   ``Brazilians have multiple religious loyalties simultaneously,''
says Paul Carden, director of the institute. ``They go to
Seicho-no-Ie (a Buddhist sect) on Wednesday, an Umbanda ritual on
Friday and Mass on Sunday. The option depends on the need of the
moment.''
   Since 1970, the number of Brazilian Catholics has dropped from 92
percent of the population to 85 percent. Meanwhile, the number of
Protestants _ and especially Pentecostals _ has tripled to nearly 15
percent.
   ``Roman Catholicism is a baptizing-marrying-and-burying religion,
but not relied on for everyday needs,'' Carden says. ``The two major
options today are Afro-Brazilian spirit religions and Pentecostal
Protestantism. They are making the most converts at this time.''
   The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Brazil's
fastest-growing Pentecostal church, says that more than 90 percent
of its members are former spirit worshipers.
   Jose Paiva de Oliveira is president of Brazil's Candomble and
Umbanda Federation, which claims 50 million members. He is revered
as a ``babalao alaba,'' which he says is ``like the Pope'' of
Afro-Brazilian religions.
   Millions believe Pai Paiva (Father Paiva) can predict the future,
talk to the dead and cure the ill with herbs or by reading
``buzios,'' or sacred seashells. He often participates in the ritual
sacrificing of goats, sheep and chickens to the African gods.
   Those who follow his counsel include top-ranking government
officials including, it is said, President Jose Sarney.
   ``If I wasn't right most of the time, I wouldn't have
credibility,'' he says. ``Sixty percent of government officials come
to me...The senator who wants to be minister, the colonel who wants
to be general. Of course the top brass don't come personally. They
send underlings.''
   The religious rivalry grew in the 1970s, when a population boom
and Brazil's ``economic miracle'' brought a flood of migrants from
the countryside to urban slums.
   ``People leave their little hometown, go to the big city and,
poof, their identity is gone, they're floating,'' Carden says.
``They've got to establish roots, have a role, a community.
Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions provide it.''
   The Pentecostals also got a boost from television and the popular
programs of U.S. evangelists such as Jimmy Swaggart and Rex Humbard.
Today, dozens of U.S.-based Protestant churches operate in Brazil.
   But the big success story is a Brazilian sect, The Universal
Church of the Kingdom of God. Founded in 1977 with 30 members, today
it has more than 600 churches in Brazil, two in New York and one in
New Jersey, with a daily attendance of some 500,000. The church also
runs a publishing house, two radio stations and a morning TV program.

   Bishop Edir Macedo Bezerra, the church's founder and leader,
directs his message straight at spirit worshipers.
   ``Ogum, show yourself. Exu, I summon you. Then you're going to
BURN in the name of Jesus,'' he screams, invoking the African spirit
gods at a weekly exorcism ceremony at the church's headquarters in
Rio's Abolicao district.
   Scores in the audience swoon as they ``receive'' the spirits.
Ushers guide them forward to the stage, where Macedo Bezerra calls
on the Holy Spirit to expel the entities.
   Gradually the ``possessed'' parishioners recover with a shudder
and are helped back to their seats.
   ``Spiritists are more sincere than evangelists or Catholics,''
says Macedo Bezerra, a former spirit worshiper himself. ``We have
the greatest compassion for them. But we must show them they're on
the wrong road and rip the devil out of their bodies.''
   However, some Pentecostal followers have been accused of trying
to convert disbelievers by force.
   Oju Oba, an African-culture group in Rio that assists spirit
centers, says it receives almost daily complaints of aggression by
Pentacostalists.
   ``One spirit center was stoned. In another, a girl was
sequestered by Pentecostalists and preached to for three days,''
says Jairo Pereira de Jesus, a member of Oju Oba.
   Candomble followers say the main problem is a misunderstanding
about Exu, a deity symbolized by a phallus and iron spikes and often
equated with the devil.
   ``The idea of heaven and hell doesn't exist in African religions.
Exu is the dynamic principle, vitality, fertility, transformation,''
says Gesia de Oliveira, a member of Oju Oba and a Candomble
practitioner.
   The Brazilian Catholic Church has given up trying to repress
spirit cults. Instead, some priests want to ``Africanize'' the
Catholic ritual to compete with the cults.
   ``Candomble has a great fraternal element. Catholics go to Mass
and remain anonymous. It's not a meeting of brothers,'' says the
Rev. Felix Neefjes, a Dutch-born priest in the Ecumenism and
Religious Dialogue sector of the Brazilian Bishops Conference. ``The
Church has to ask itself if it's corresponding to the people's
needs.''
   Da Silva, a doctor of theology and dean of the Theological School
for the archdiocese of Sao Paulo, heads a clerical campaign to bring
together Catholicism and African religions.
   In some Masses, samba music is played on atabaques, agogos and
other African instruments. Sometimes the altar is removed and
flowers and fruit offerings placed on a cloth laid on the floor,
African-style.
   ``African culture is our common mother,'' da Silva says. ``To
Africans, the earth is the altar of God, Olorum. The black Catholic
is rediscovering this.''
   Da Silva concedes that some bishops ``are upset'' at the changes.
   ``They know only the Roman way, the European way,'' he says.
``But this is a new vitality. It is the Latin American church
renewed.''
   Some believe the Roman Catholic Church has become too
accommodating since the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65.
   ``The Church is afraid of losing people,'' says Carden of the
Christian Research Institute. ``It can't catechize them, so it wants
to make them feel at home and not leave the Church. It's a very
serious compromise. They're talking about African gods and
anti-biblical things.''
   Many spirit worshipers just wish Christians would leave them
alone.
   Mae Meninazinha de Oxum, or ``Mother Little Girl of Oxum,'' is a
Candomble priestess in Sao Joao de Meriti, a poor city north of Rio.
Recently she literally had to bar her door to prevent
Pentecostalists from invading.
   ``They cursed us and said we would burn in hell,'' she says.
``They're fanatics. We respect all religions, but we are not
respected.''
   Mae Beata de Iemanja, a priestess at the Yle Omi Oju Aro
Candomble center in the nearby Sao Mateus district, also has battled
police and preachers to preserve her religion.
   ``I was baptized a Catholic, but today, knowing what I do of the
religion of the orixas, I wouldn't do it,'' says the 57-year-old
priestess, dressed in the traditional white lace dress, turban and
colored ritual necklaces of Candomble. ``Nature is our religion.
Nature purifies, blesses, does everything. It has force.
   ``When Olorum made the world, he made a place for everything he
created. So why fight? We are all children of Olorum.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Back in 1972, painter Russell Chatham left the
fast-lane California art scene and moved to Montana, a more
congenial place for his particular vision. His object was serenity
more than success. Ironically, after years of struggle, he's become
a favorite of some of Hollywood's rich and famous.

<TEXT>
   Just as Vincent van Gogh's supreme
struggle with his artistic demons came at Arles, and Paul Gauguin's
unorthodox genius escaped onto canvas in Tahiti, so American painter
Russell Chatham has found his vision in a valley called Paradise.
   Chatham is no Gaugin or van Gogh, as he'd be the first to admit.
But at age 49, he's been painting since he was 7. Descended from
artists who always struggled, Chatham assumed he would always be
poor. His first memories center on his grandfather, Gottardo
Piazzoni, who painted the 14 landscape murals in the main branch of
the San Francisco Library.
   Forever fresh in his mind is the image of his grandfather, on
scaffolding, painting. Ansel Adams captured the same stark scene
with black-and-white film. The recollection evokes in Chatham the
feeling of being in a cathedral, of having a religious experience.
The memory and the photograph intertwine in his mind. Early, he knew
that art was his destiny.
   ``I knew I could get by somehow,'' Chatham says. ``Painting was
the most important thing of all in my family, it was what you were
supposed to do. Once you sense that, you shouldn't go against it. I
never thought about the money. I basically assumed it was impossible
to make a living as a painter. But that was what I was, so I got
by.''
   Chatham's desire to pursue his passion in a pure place, without
external confusion or false rewards, led him from his native Marin
County, Calif., to the Paradise Valley and Livingston, Mont., in
1972.
   His old fishing buddy, Thomas McGuane, was the catalyst. He'd
left the increasingly crowded San Francisco Bay area in 1969 and
wrote back about the glories of Yellowstone trout. The artist, a
record-holding fisherman considered to be one of the best flycasters
in the nation, was hooked. So were pals Richard Brautigan and
William Hjortsberg. They all headed for Montana.
   When he left Bolinas, Chatham had a yard sale which included
dozens of his paintings priced at 25 cents and 50 cents apiece. Many
didn't sell, so, along with the rest of his possessions, they were
piled into a '49 Chevy pickup. He still cherishes that truck, as
well as a '47 Plymouth, despite their near terminal infirmities.
   Arriving alongside Deep Creek with $5 in his pocket, Chatham
borrowed a stake from McGuane and moved into a $50-a-month old
ranchstead which he still rents for about the same price. In a shed
he converted into a studio, the newcomer set about learning the
artistic nuances of his adopted home.
   He translated violent autumns, numbing winters, and the green
caress of a high plains spring into oils, acrylics, and lithographs.
He toiled amid mountains called Crazies and Absarokas, Gallatins and
Tetons. He painted dry fields and woolly cattle, ghostly rivers that
ran quiet and clear through sagebrush and sand.
   Often the paintings and lithographs were subtle and muted, with a
brooding quality. He worked slowly. Six or seven major canvases a
year was a good year.
   Chatham is not a Western artist in the mode of Charles Russell or
Frederic Remington. He is not counted _ nor does he wish to be _
among the contemporary painters who earn big bucks with their gaudy
cowboys, bucking broncos, and outlandish versions of what long-ago
mountain men might have looked like.
   Year after year, Chatham quietly painted the elusive landscape of
Montana and seldom sold his visions. He became his own one-man
school of art: not Western, not photo realism, not illustration,
simply ``Chatham.''
   ``Some people have described it as impressionism, but it isn't,''
Chatham says. ``Not everything in life can or should be explained.''
   By the late 1970s, the reviewers were paying attention, but
Chatham was still broke.
   Meanwhile, his transplanted California buddies were becoming rich
and famous.

   Brautigan published ``Trout Fishing in America,'' writer
Hjortsberg hit it big with ``Falling Angel,'' and McGuane sold his
novel ``92 in the Shade'' to Hollywood, launching himself as a
popular screenwriter. And each began to load up on Chatham pictures.
   A born barterer, Chatham swapped his art for firewood and fishing
rods, baby-sitting service and airline tickets, medical care and
food _ even a handmade afghan. Which explains why a few dozen
cowboys and merchants in Livingston now own Chatham originals worth
thousands of dollars.
   Because, after nearly 200 one-man shows which usually lost money,
after living on less than $15,000 annually, eked out through sales
to friends and free-lance writing, Chatham has made enough in the
last two years to stay out of debt with some left over. Today his
paintings command up to $60,000, with an average of $10,000 to
$30,000 per canvas.
   ``Now, 28 years after taking up this desperate line of work
professionally, it appears the work is fulfilling its function,
which is simply to add a measure of interest and dimension to
people's lives in an almost subliminal way by inhabiting their walls
just as a spirit might inhabit a gloomy stairway,'' writes Chatham
in a slim brochure about his work.
   He has become the artist-of-choice for many of Hollywood's hip
and famous. Actor Jack Nicholson reportedly owns 30 Chatham
canvases. Other buyers include movie stars Jeff Bridges, Peter
Fonda, and Dennis Quaid (all Paradise Valley transplants), Robert
Redford, Jane Fonda, Ali McGraw, and Harrison Ford.
   Thus, the supreme irony of Russell Chatham's life is that, having
moved away from the hyped-up fast lane of the California art scene
where patrons abound, wealthy admirers found him by what he calls
``accident'' when they came to fly-fish and make movies in a small
Montana town on the edge of nowhere.
   As Chatham talks, he paints, neither exercise hampering the
other. He is dressed in untied tennis shoes, a rumpled shirt, and
oil-splattered pants. He is a big man, barrel-chested, brawny-armed.
His eyes are large and liquid, now brown, now gray, depending on the
angle of the studio's flat north light. His nose, once described by
a friend as a bobsled run, fits sideways on his face. The image is
uncannily like a Gauguin self-portrait.
   It is a silent Sunday. None of the seven employees he now pays to
keep track of his growing business are around. He has the entire
second floor of a building which also houses Sax & Fryer, a
bookstore which has helped Livingstonites find erudition since 1883.
   Stacked in the hallways are oils, acrylics, and large framed
prints from his ``Missouri Headwaters'' series of 12 original
lithographs. Most are going to Seattle for two major shows, one at
the Davidson Gallery, the other at the Kimzey Miller Gallery,
through late November.
   After years of living on the edge, Chatham at last finds himself
riding the crest of a success his admirers say will last the
remainder of his life.
   But for Chatham there is much more to living than just painting.
There are his wife, Suzanne, and their 3-year-old daughter, Rebecca.
There are new books to write and old ones to re-issue through his
new publishing venture, the Livingston-based Clark City Press.
   There are pickup games of pool to be played with strangers across
the street, birds to be hunted with old friends on cold days, fish
to be caught.
   Writing in ``Sports Illustrated'' a few years ago, McGuane told
of being in the river and looking up to see Chatham: ``I see my
friend and neighbor, a painter, walking along the high cutbank above
the river. This would be a man who has ruined his life with sport.
He skulks from his home at all hours with gun or rod. Today he has
both.
   ```What are you doing?'
   ```Trout fishing and duck hunting...As you can see,' says the
painter gesticulating strangely, `I'm ready for anything. I spoiled
half the day with work and errands.'''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are the victims of heart attacks, among
those who survived. But rather than resume their old bad habits they
decided to follow the advice of doctors and alter their lifestyles.
Now, one will be picked to get a prize as an example for others to
follow.

   It's a brand new contest with a $10,000 first prize, but you may
be glad that you are not an entrant. On the other hand, all who have
been nominated are glad they are in the running.
   The award: Heart Patient of the Year.
   Some 100 hospitals are participating, nominating those men and
women who essentially became ``born again'' heart patients after
suffering heart attacks. Nearly 1.5 million Americans suffer heart
attacks each year and about 450,000 have second heart attacks.
   Nominees, chosen by their doctors, are people who have altered
their lives considerably through diet, exercise, medication
(including aspirin), quitting smoking, avoiding stress, and, if
applicable, trying to go from Type A to Type B.
   Dr. Robert C. Schlant, a professor of cardiology at Emory
University School of Medicine in Atlanta, says he agreed to serve on
the advisory committee because the recognition could stimulate other
heart patients to follow physicians' orders.
   ``Sometimes it's rather discouraging to see how people are living
after their recovery,'' says Schlant, a heart disease specialist who
has served as president of the Association of University
Cardiologists and chairman of the council on clinical cardiology for
the American Heart Association. ``They may stop smoking for a while,
but then a year later, they are back on cigarettes.
   ``We're doing rather miserably in getting people to alter their
lifestyles. In an ideal world, this contest will also get some
people to alter their lives before anything happens. After all,
everything we do, bypassing, other surgeries, after-care treatment,
is secondary and palliative. It's primary prevention that is
needed.''
   One of the nominees already announced is Achille ``Kelly''
D'Aprile, now 48, who is in far better shape than he was four years
ago when he suffered a heart attack. He gave up the pack of
cigarettes a day he was smoking, he shed about 35 pounds, and he now
jogs to work out stress.
   ``The hardest thing was realizing I had a heart attack,'' says
D'Aprile, owner of a deli and liquor store in Weathersfield, Conn.
``I'd never been in a hospital before. I got chest pains going to
visit somebody in the hospital.
   ``At the time I was working 16 to 18 hours a day. I ate all the
butters, breads and meats I wanted. I had to make a major adjustment
to try and not be such a Type A personality with workaholic
tendencies.''
   D'Aprile has even created a low-cholesterol special sausage for
his deli customers, made with either veal or veal and chicken.
   Schlant notes that most heart patients do, in fact, end up more
active and stronger than before.
   There are exceptions. Herman Rice, 67, of Linthicum Heights, Md.,
suffered too much damage when he had a major attack in 1982. But the
doctors call him their miracle patient.
   Rice worked on an assembly line at a meatpacking plant when he
felt such pain in his forefingers that he asked the foreman if he
could see the nurse.
   A man not accustomed to being ill, a non-smoker and teetotaler,
Rice ran up the four flights to the medical office, collapsed, and
was left with only 40 percent of his heart intact, despite
triple-bypass surgery.
   ``When he first came home from the hospital he was crying and
depressed, because he had to retire, he couldn't lift anything over
5 pounds, and his exercise was limited to walking,'' his wife says.
   ``I told him to stop crying. The Lord had given him another
inning. When he said he didn't know what for, I told him he was here
to keep me company.

   ``I'm a strict nurse. I've had him for 37 years and I want to
keep him. I'm happy to lift the shopping bags.''
   Margaret Miko of Catonsville, Md., also 67, says that before her
heart attack she felt that Westinghouse Corp. would probably fold
without her. She was a secretary to an important executive.
   Mrs. Miko, a widow, goes to the cardiac rehabilitation center at
St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore three times a week, dons a sweat
suit, does her warm-ups, and works out on the rowing, the treadmill
and the bicycle.
   ``I was never what you would call the athletic type, but now I
wouldn't miss it.''
   Mrs. Miko collapsed on the job during a stressful day at work and
remembers someone shouting for anyone with knowledge of CPR.
   ``They practically had the shovel out,'' she says. ``The CPR and
prayers pulled me through. The priest gave me the last rites.''
   Dr. Raymond Bahr, director of the coronary care unit at St. Agnes
Hospital, says he decided to nominate patients because of the
transformations he saw in some. He says 1,700 heart patients a year
come through this coronary care unit alone.
   ``The transformation of character is something like being born
again,'' Bahr says. ``They have something the rest of us don't
appreciate. They see life differently after a heart attack.''
   Bahr, as a heart specialist, regrets that so many people wait
until it's too late to make the changes that will make their heart
stronger.
   ``Too many people have to wait until a Mack truck is sitting on
their chest,'' he says.
   Bahr's nominess include both Mrs. Miko and Miller, who were
virtually given up for dead.
   Another of Bahr's nominees is Bernie Walter, 45, a baseball coach
and athletic director of Arundel High School outside of Annapolis,
Md.
   Walter points out that even though he was a health educator, he
ignored the early warning signals. He suffered several aches in both
elbows early in the day, but laid down for a few minutes and it went
away. Then he coached for two hours and felt better but not quite
good.
   ``I just felt really tired. At 8:30 that night I was watching a
hockey game. It was the Stanley Cup. The Philadelphia Flyers were
winning 2-0 when the guy started down the ice to score the third
goal. Then I had the severe pain and I told my wife,'' he admits.
   He was rushed to the hospital, given a clot-dissolving drug, and
the heart attack was arrested quickly.
   ``I'm not handicapped in any way,'' he says. ``The idea is not
just keeping you alive, the idea is getting you back to doing the
things you want to do.''
   Walter certainly is. He's totally altered his life.
   ``I'm also beating out infield hits now,'' he says.
``Occasionally even getting a double.''
   Bahr says Walter is an excellent example of what early care can
mean.
   Walter took both his weight and his blood pressure down and
eliminated salt, red meat and any canned products from his diet.
   ``Before that, cheese and gravy was right down my alley and it
was always red meat,'' he says. ``Now we shop very carefully.''
   ``As you can probably tell,'' he says, ``I'm a type A
personality. I'm learning to change that. If I feel too much
pressure, I'll just say the heck with it and go home and ride my
bike.''
   Both the patient and the hospital who nominated him or her will
receive $10,000, a grant from the makers of Ecotrin safety-coated
aspirin.
   It will be presented on _ when else _ Valentine's Day.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ We listen to their warnings and board up our
houses. We don't trust them when they forecast a nice day. Yet no
experts touch the lives of more Americans than weather forecasters,
people like Ron McPherson, the new deputy director of the National
Weather Service.

   The clouds hugged the Texas Hill Country on a
gray day 27 years ago. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson waited
impatiently for word he could fly out of his ranch on the Pedernales
River.
   The flight hinged on a National Weather Service forecast, left to
a neophyte weatherman with more than a little awe of the vice
president.
   Ron McPherson says it was one of his toughest calls in three
decades of forecasting: ``I was a 22-year-old kid with a year's
service and here's a vice president who wants to get out of his
ranch. When he wanted to go somewhere, he wanted to go. He didn't
take too kindly to the clouds covering the hills.''
   But for McPherson, there was no other way. Johnson had to make it
to Austin by car. Johnson's pilot let McPherson know the vice
president was not too happy with the arrogance of the weather.
   The memory has stayed with McPherson through his career which
began as an undergraduate intern in 1959 while at the University of
Texas in Austin, one that has now taken him to the agency's
second-highest post.
   He was named deputy director of the weather service in September
and started work in mid-October, in charge of day-to-day operations
at an organization attempting to move into the 21st century.
   ``But what better person is there than a guy who worked his way
up in the system?'' asks Don Witten, a spokesman for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which operates the weather
service.
   The service has 299 offices nationwide responsible for watching
and warning of storms, tornadoes, hurricanes and flash floods. It
plays a key role in space and air travel and is at the edge of
research into understanding such phenomena as drought, wind shear
and turbulent storms that die almost as quickly as they erupt.
   What attracts McPherson to weather, he says, is its uncertainty.
   ``It's knowing that you're dealing with something slippery.
You're trained to deal with uncertainty, fragments of evidence, more
than any other profession than maybe law,'' he says.
   Those fragments come from scores of sources around the country
and the world _ from forecasters in the field and thousands of
volunteer storm spotters, weather balloons and river forecasting
centers at the headwaters of the nation's major waterways, ships at
sea and satellites hovering above the equator and circling the poles.
   The weather service, which traces its roots to the Army's Signal
Corps in the late 1800s, has sometimes been on the cutting edge of
technology and other times lagged behind, McPherson says.
   Now the weather service is trying to buy its way into the future,
ordering up some sophisticated new electronic equipment to replace
some of its antiquated methods and gear. The new probes will allow
forecasters to look inside a major storm system and maybe even
predict a tornado in the embyronic stage, or the kinds of storms and
squalls that spark killer flash floods.
   It is part of the NEXRAD project of the service, the Air Force
and the Federal Aviation Agency.
   The basic unit is automated Doppler radar, which will allow
meteorologists to look inside weather systems to see the movement of
water droplets, vapor and dust particles which will betray otherwise
invisible winds and air turbulence, which will in turn betray the
formation of severe storms and tornadoes.
   Doppler radar is more refined than current radar which can only
detect water in weather systems, but not its movement. A Doppler
system reads the returning radar echo and determines whether it is
shortening or lengthening, much the way the ear can determine that
an approaching ambulance siren has a higher pitch than one going
away. Computers can then give operators a more instant and fluid
reading on what is going on inside clouds.
   The first of the 170 to 190 units will be installed in the early
1990s at a cost of $2.5 million each.
   McPherson hopes, too, that they will help explain how the weather
systems work.
   ``You can't forecast what you don't understand, and you have to
be able to observe what you're going to forecast.''
   McPherson's most recent job was as chief of the meteorological
operations division at the National Meteorological Center, a weather
service branch outside Washington. He moved there from San Antonio
20 years ago.
   Growing up in Port Arthur, McPherson says he was bitten by the
weather bug as a 12-year-old Boy Scout working on a weather merit
badge. As part of the assignment, McPherson says he read a passage
from the book, ``Storm,'' by George R. Stewart.
   ``The story is about a forecast office on the West Coast tracking
a major Pacific storm and its impact on land and on people. It was
very impressive for a 12-year-old kid,'' he says.
   ``As it turns out, I've run into at least eight or 10 people who
have read the same novel and gotten into meteorology through the
influence of that novel. It's a little dated now, but it's still a
good story.''
   ``You can get hooked on weather,'' Don Witten of NOAA says.
``What is it that touches every human life on earth? One of the
answers is weather. It can make you an orphan, it can bring you a
fresh crop. It can cause you a lot of trouble getting to work; yet
there's nothing like a beautiful day.''

   In her final year on ``Murder, She Wrote,''
Angela Lansbury as mystery writer Jessica Fletcher briefly considers
an offer of marriage from a rich suitor.
   But a second marriage is not for the widowed J.B. Fletcher, nor
is it the way Lansbury wants to wrap up five years on the hit CBS
mystery series.
   Although she's ending the show's long and successful run by her
own choice, Lansbury is not yet ready to sever her connection with
Jessica Fletcher. She wants to leave the character unencumbered so
that she can return for an occasional movie of ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   ``It's my decision to end the series. I want to do movies, movies
for television and go back to Broadway,'' says Lansbury, who won
four Tony awards for her performances on the New York stage.
   This Sunday you can watch her solve another mystery on ``Murder,
She Wrote,'' then on Monday she stars in the NBC movie ``Shootdown.''
   In ``Shootdown,'' she plays Nan Moore, a mother whose son is
among those killed when a Soviet fighter plane shot down Korean Air
Lines flight 007 on Sept. 1, 1983. She presses for more information
to cut through the cloudy circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
   ``She was instrumental in keeping up the fight to have Congress
investigate why the plane was where it was and whether it was
deliberately off course,'' she says. ``The movie doesn't come to any
conclusion, but it does place all the facts in front of the audience
so people can make up their own mind. There were so many conflicting
reports.''
   Lansbury is pleased that the real Mrs. Moore has seen the movie
and likes her interpretation.
   ``I was very concerned about playing someone who's still alive,''
Lansbury says. ``I had seen newsreels of her and had seen her on
`Donahue.' In the picture they inserted shots of me to make it look
like I was on `Donahue.'''
   The movie also stars Jennifer Savidge, George Coe and Molly Hagen
and Kyle Secor as her son, John.
   Lansbury was frequently cast as the mother of grown people
earlier in her career. Probably her most famous mother role was in
``The Manchurian Candidate,'' a chilling 1962 political thriller
that was withdrawn until recently because of the Kennedy
assassination.
   She played the mother of Laurence Harvey, who was only three
years younger. The role also called for her to be insanely
ambitious, directing the career of her husband, a Joseph
McCarthy-type senator.
   The ``mother phase'' of her career ended when she went to New
York and won Tonys for roles in ``Mame,'' ``Dear World,'' ``Gypsy''
and ``Sweeney Todd.''
   Lansbury was at the 750-acre Saddle Rock Ranch, set in a bowl in
the Malibu Mountains between Los Angeles and the Pacific coast, to
film two episodes of ``Murder, She Wrote,'' with Dale Robertson as a
wealthy rancher.
   ``I visit this man who served on the same flight crew with my
late husband in the Korean War,'' she says. ``He's a widower and I'm
a widow, and he thinks we should get together. It's one of the few
times Jessica is tempted to give up her independence. But I'm not
ready to make that decision and at the end of the show I return to
Cabot Cove.''
   The series hasn't changed much since Jessica Fletcher, a former
substitute teacher, published her first mystery novel and solved her
first case in September 1984. She is still the curious busybody
who's always at hand when murder strikes. She finds the clues the
police overlook, and thus is able to pick out the killer from among
the guest-star suspects.
   ``The big change is that she has become very successful as a
writer,'' Lansbury says. ``She has become a celebrity. She has
become more urbane and sophisticated, although she has not lost that
small-town feeling. Her world has opened up tremendously.
   ``She has become a champion of middle-aged women and women
struggling to maintain their position in life, even though they're
alone.''
   Lansbury also has shed about 16 pounds gained in the early years
of ``Murder, She Wrote.'' She also champions the cause of middle-age
women with a fitness and health video called ``Angela Lansbury's
Positive Moves.''
   ``I went on a diet and a regimen of non-strenuous exercise,'' she
says. `` People kept asking, `What have you done to yourself? You
look 20 years younger.' I was finally persuaded by my agent to make
the tape for women my age. It's an intimate discussion of one
woman's way of taking care of herself.''

   If there's one thing Julie Wilson has learned
during her long career singing in nightclubs and high-tone places
like the Plaza and the St. Regis and the Algonquin, it's never count
on anything.
   ``I'm a total fatalist,'' says the sophisticated song stylist
known for her impeccable way with lyrics. ``I feel if it's going to
happen, it's going to happen. If it's not, it's not.''
   So when Peter Allen told her nearly five years ago that he would
write a role for her in his first Broadway musical, she didn't tell
anyone.
   ``Not a soul,'' Miss Wilson says. ``You know when you want
something so much, it's like the kiss of death if you talk about it.
I didn't open my trap.''
   Her silence _ and waiting _ paid off.
   Miss Wilson now is appearing with Allen at the Mark Hellinger
Theater in ``Legs Diamond,'' a new musical about the 1920s New York
gangster. Allen, who wrote the show's music and lyrics, also plays
the famous outlaw. Miss Wilson is Flo, a woman who fronts a
nightclub secretly owned by Diamond.
   ``They needed a woman of my age and experience to play this role,
someone who's been around the block _ more than once,'' she laughs.
``I'm the older woman in this show. Believe me, I am the oldie. I
like to say `oldie but goodie.'''
   For Miss Wilson, ``Legs Diamond'' is her first Broadway musical
in nearly two decades. Broadway has only been a part of her show
business career, which began at the age of 17 back in Omaha when she
was chosen Miss Nebraska. Since then, there have been touring shows,
radio, television, recordings, summer stock and stints in London
where she appeared in West End editions of ``Kiss Me Kate,'' ``South
Pacific'' and ``Bells Are Ringing.''
   But her bread and butter has been nightclubs. Usually wearing a
slinky gown and a gardenia perched behind her ear, Miss Wilson has
sung the best songs of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Rodgers and
Hart, Kurt Weill, Stephen Sondheim and other Broadway writers.
   Allen's material has been a more recent addition. She met him for
the first time in the 1970s, but he knew about her long before that.
   ``When he was a kid, dancing in Australia, somebody sent him an
old record of mine called `Julie Wilson at the St. Regis,''' she
says.
   Those days in the early 1970s were lean years for Miss Wilson in
New York. Suddenly there was no place to sing. Big clubs were
closing all over town.
   ``I was fighting for my life,'' she recalls. ``I grabbed whatever
came my way. Things like small roles in plays like `Norman, Is That
You?' in Paramus, N.J.''
   At the time, Miss Wilson and Allen shared the same voice teacher
_ Keith Davis. They still do.
   ``I became very aware of Peter because my teacher was always
talking about him and because he had the big hit song, `I Honestly
Love You,''' the singer recalls.
   Whenever she got a job, there would be flowers and a note from
Allen. Sometimes, he and a group of friends would show up to cheer
her on. She attended a lot of his concerts, too, and they became
good friends.
   Then, in 1976, she left New York, returning to Omaha for an
eight-year sabbatical to take care of her ailing parents and raise
her two sons. When she came back in 1984 to resume her career, Allen
showed up at Michael's Pub, an East Side nightclub, to hear her
sing. It was then that he told her about ``Legs Diamond'' and his
plans for her.
   Nothing happened.
   A year later, she was at her voice teacher's studio and ran into
Allen again. ``Would you like to hear your song?'' he asked.
   Allen sat down at the piano and played ``The Music Went Out of My
Life,'' the song Miss Wilson sings in ``Legs Diamond.''
   ``It's a little soliloquy,'' she says. ``It's a woman singing
about her loves, what happened and why they didn't work out.''
   Then another year went by, and Miss Wilson was asked to perform
with Allen in a workshop production of ``Legs.'' The workshop was
done in March 1987. The show's producers decided the book by Charles
Suppon needed work.
   Harvey Fierstein, author of ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' was brought
in to help, to sharpen some of the characters and make the story
brighter.
   Then the show was finally announced to open on Broadway in the
fall of 1988.
   But before ``Legs Diamond'' went into rehearsal, Miss Wilson
found out she was under consideration to replace Dolores Gray and
sing the show-stopping ``I'm Still Here'' in the London production
of ``Follies.'' She told her agent ``no.'' Her heart belonged to
Allen.
   ``I don't want anything else,'' Miss Wilson told her agent. ``I
just want to hang out, do my club thing and hope that the show will
go.''
   She doesn't regret her decision.
   ``I'm on the boards until they get rid of me,'' she says. ``I
knew I had to chance it.''

   Until this year, soft-voiced Agvam
Tadevosyan was a card-carrying Communist and had a steady job. Then
came a transformation: He was sent to jail twice for anti-Soviet
agitation, lost his job and resigned from the Communist Party.
   All this came about, he says, because of what he sees as
Kremlin-imposed terror in his homeland of Soviet Armenia and he
maintains that terror must be answered with terror.
   He is not alone in his view of the Kremlin in Moscow.
   From a tent on a Yerevan square, Khachik Stamboltsyan campaigns
for election to Armenia's Supreme Soviet, or legislature. The
biophysicist expresses scorn for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, charging that
the Soviet leader ``has shown us he is no democrat, but a dictator.''
   Ten months into a bitter territorial dispute with the neighboring
Soviet republic of Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea, Armenian voices
cry out in anger and frustration. They have turned their hostility
toward the Communist Party and Soviet system, presenting a threat to
Gorbachev and the unity of the multi-ethnic nation he heads.
   Many Armenians predict a confrontation with Soviet authorities,
perhaps even a violent explosion.
   ``People are ready to persevere until our demands are met,'' said
Rafael Poposyan, a former political prisoner, literary critic and
Armenian activist. ``I think this movement can be crushed only with
tanks.''
   In February, tens of thousands marched in Yerevan, the Armenian
republic's capital, to demand the annexation of the predominantly
Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh district, which has been part of
Azerbaijan since 1923. Anti-Armenian rioting broke out in
Azerbaijan, and at least 32 people _ 26 of them Armenians _ were
killed.
   Led by Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the central
government's top executive body in Moscow, dashed Armenians' hopes
in July by ruling that Azerbaijan's refusal to go along with a
change in its territory took precedence over Nagorno-Karabakh's
petition to join Armenia.
   The Kremlin decision, backed by a tough back-to-work order and
the dispatch of troops to enforce order, produced a brief calm. But
a new wave of strikes and demonstrations broke out in September, and
what began as the ``Karabakh movement'' broadened into an alternate
political force, with rival tendencies, that challenges the
leadership of the Communist Party on issues from ecology to economic
reform.
   ``The movement started with slogans like `We support glasnost and
perestroika,' and people carrying pictures of Gorbachev,'' Popoyan
said. ``This lasted as long as the Armenians had faith that
Gorbachev would understand.''
   Many Armenians now don't have that faith.
   A poster in an open-air exhibit of protest art in Yerevan's Opera
Square, nerve center of the republic's burgeoning nationalist
sentiment, depicts a weeping Armenia and reads: ``Moscow does not
believe in tears.''
   Armenians are painfully aware that for centuries, the very
survival of their largely Orthodox Christian people has often seemed
at stake. For some, the rioting in Sumgait was a terrifying reprise
of the 1915 Armenian genocide organized by Turkey, in which 1.5
million Armenians are said to have perished.
   The mostly Moslem Azerbajanis are ethnically related to the
Turks, and Armenians commonly call them ``Turks.'' Atop a windswept
Yerevan hill, hundreds Armenians come daily to lay flowers at the
memorial to the 1915 genocide victims, in a ritual made more
poignant by the spilling of Armenian blood in Sumgait.
   ``Here 1.5 million Armenians are symbolically buried,'' said one
recent visitor, Gayany Sarkisyan, 25. ``Today the same thing has
started again, in Sumgait.''
   Gorbachev rejected that logic at the Presidium meeting. He told
an Armenian speaker: ``What genocide can one speak of? You know what
that word implies, the weight it carries. You are making accusations
that you will regret for the rest of your life.''
   Gorbachev acknowledged the Karabakh issue had been long
neglected, and the Kremlin has approved a plan to promote the area's
economic and social development by pumping in government money. But
he drew the line at a redrawing of borders, which could set off a
chain reaction among other disaffected Soviet minorities.
   ``If placing the Nagorno-Karabakh Automonous Region under the
jurisdiction of someone else is the only way, then we should recarve
our whole country,'' Gorbachev said. `People have lived here for
centuries. They'll say to us: Have you people at the center gone
crazy or something?''
   Some in Armenia, dismayed by what they see as Moscow's
pro-Azerbaijan tilt, speak openly of organizing a secession attempt.
   ``If they won't accord us the rights that are our due, we'll have
a referendum and vote to live outside the Soviet Union,'' says
would-be lawmaker Stamboltsyan.
   ``Our movement has become a much wider movement _ its goal is now
independence,'' says Tadevosyan, 22, who was fired from his job as a
civilian firearms instructor after he was sentenced to two 15-day
jail terms.
   Tadevosyan said he expects Moscow officials to provoke an
incident in order to provide a pretext for liquidating the Karabakh
movement.
   ``Against state terror we can only reply with terror _ and the
state is using terror,'' he claims.
   For others, however, the Karabakh issue, and not independence, is
still paramount.
   ``Since the Soviet Union has been founded, there have been two
Armenias, and now we want to reunite them, to bring the baby back to
the mother,'' said Artur Danilyan, 52, a worker at a Yerevan perfume
factory.
   Despite the outspoken nationalist sentiment, faith in Moscow has
not vanished among many Armenians. A middle-aged Armenian bard, his
voice choking with emotion, gathered a crowd around him on Opera
Square as he read a poem that included these lines:
   ``And if Russia knew the truth, about what Islam was doing here,
   ``She would sweep the Moslem lice from the face of Russia.''
   The Armenian Apostolic Church, an officially recognized religious
body in the ostensibly atheist Soviet state, has opposed the Kremlin
decision on Karabakh and expressed hope for eventual reunification
between the region of more than 160,000 people and Armenia, itself
about the size of Maine with 3.4 million inhabitants.
   ``Karabakh is historically Armenian territory,'' Archbishop
Nersess Bozabalian said in an interview. ``What people there want is
the freedom to work, to produce and to achieve their aims without
losing their national integrity.''
   The waves of strikes called in Yerevan over the Karabakh issue
have subsided, and special units of internal security troops sent to
the city were withdrawn from the streets in October. But
politically, Armenia remains on the boil.
   On a recent Monday, more than 1,000 marchers set out for Yerevan
from Echmiadzin, the cradle of the Armenian church, to demand
unification with Karabakh and the removal of Echmiadzin's party
chief, whom they accused of corruption and inaction. They turned
back only after a high party official was sent out to the highway to
meet with them.
   Armenia, by all accounts, will never be the same.
   ``These past 10 months have been like a century,'' Stamboltsyan
said. ``We have learned so much. It's as if the entire republic has
been to university.''

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, The Associated Press rode along on a
pre-dawn trip to Denver, where Mexican farm worker Alejandro Fierro,
wearing his best blue jeans and finest cowboy hat, met U.S.
immigration officers face to face and applied for amnesty. After 30
years of working illegally, Fierro now boasts a plastic-laminated
temporary residence card. Today, with only days remaining until the
deadline for Special Agricultural Workers to apply for the
government's one-time amnesty, Fierro is well along the way to
permanent status _ and maybe citizenship.

<TEXT>
   After three decades of sneaking into the
United States to earn a living for his family, Mexican farm worker
Alejandro Fierro this year strode across the border, upright and
legal, with proof in his pocket that America's new amnesty program
works.
   Fierro was 19 in 1958 when he first swam the Rio Grande and, like
his father and grandfather before him, became an illegal alien
working in the fields of El Norte _ the land up north.
   Last summer, spiffy in a new shirt and polished cowboy boots, he
summoned up his courage and walked into the Denver office of the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to apply for amnesty
under the landmark Immigration Control and Reform Act of 1986.
   That legislation applied to two groups of foreigners living and
working without permission in this country. Applications from those
trying to prove continuous residency in the United States since
before 1982 totaled 1,761,766 in the one-year registration period
that ended last May 4.
   The second category encompasses illegal aliens who have worked
with perishable crops in certain periods beginning in 1984.
Applicants have until Nov. 30 to seek INS approval. As of Nov. 9,
according to INS figures, 1,014,115 Special Agricultural Workers _
SAWs _ had applied for amnesty. The approval rate was running at 92
percent.
   Fierro is one of the 281,112 SAWS granted temporary resident
status as of Oct. 31. That's the first of three steps leading to
citizenship, a move Fierro says he will consider seriously in the
next few years.
   Sitting in the shade of a big tree on a lunch break in the dawn
to past-dark Colorado onion harvest, Fierro unsnapped the left
breast pocket of his western shirt and pulled out the
plastic-laminated ID card he keeps next to his heart.
   ``A90616632, Fierro-Jacobo, Alejandro,'' says the fine print.
``Bearer entitled to reside and work in U.S. until card expires, not
eligible for federally funded assistance program ... expires Jan. 1,
1991.''
   The 49-year-old father of six speaks no English, but he knew the
meaning of every word on the INS card.
   ``I feel so happy because there is now no problem to find a job
and I can take a bus,'' said Fierro through his friend and
interpreter Reyes Perez, a U.S. citizen who's worked beside him in
farmer Harry Matsushima's fields for years.
   The INS card has given Fierro back his dignity. It's also given
his middle-aged legs a rest.
   Always before, beginning his annual migratory ritual in early
spring, Fierro would start his stealthy journey to Colorado by
buying five days' worth of tortillas, canned meat and sweets and
filling a gallon jug with water. Then, with a spare shirt stuffed in
his pocket, he would pay some strapping Mexican teen-ager $1 to
carry him piggyback across the Rio Grande near Presidio, Texas, and
strike out in the darkness on foot.
   For five days Fierro used to avoid roads and people, walking at
night and hiding by day, and finally board a northbound bus only
when all his instincts told him he was safe from arrest and
deportation.
   Not this year.
   ``For the first time, I crossed the bridge at El Paso, which is
much closer to my home in Chihuahua than Presidio. The American
inspector looks at my card. Everything is OK, so I go straight
across the bridge into the United States. I didn't have to buy food
and water. I got on a bus in El Paso and didn't have to walk
anywhere,'' Fierro said with a big smile.
   He was headed for Santa Fe to work for a few weeks in a
restaurant kitchen before Colorado's agricultural season got
underway. Thirty miles south of Alamogordo, N.M., the Border Patrol
pulled the Greyhound bus over and put Fierro's amnesty card to its
first major test.
   ``They came on and checked the whole bus. I was very relieved
because they let me pass. Everybody on the bus had papers. They
didn't catch one illegal,'' Fierro said.
   Once in Santa Fe, he said it was easy to find a $3.50-an-hour job
in a restaurant ``because there are still a lot of illegals around,
but the bosses won't hire them. They're afraid of being caught.''
   The 1986 legislation aims to prevent illegal aliens from taking
jobs that ordinarily would be filled by Americans and properly
documented workers. The INS estimates as many as 7 million illegal
aliens are still in the United States.
   Nationally, as of mid-October, the INS had issued 3,175 warning
citations and fined 720 businesses more than $2 million for
violating the new immigration law.
   Fierro considers his INS card among his most important
possessions. He has proudly showed it to his 80-year-old father,
Socorro Fierro, who, he says, pronounced it ``a very good thing.''
   Alejandro Fierro's three daughters live in Mexico. Two of his
three sons live and work in this country. One lives in Wichita,
Kan., and is married to an American. The other lives in Santa Fe and
has applied for amnesty. His third son is home in Chihuahua, tending
the 15 cows and small acreage his father has bought with his
Colorado earnings.
   ``I don't know how long I can make him stay home,'' said Fierro.
``He knows he can have a much better life in El Norte, and he wants
to come, too.''
   Fierro, who lives on about $30 a week and sends more than
two-thirds of his annual $6,000 in wages to his wife, planned to
return home ``when it gets cold.'' But he will come back next year,
and every year after that he's able to hoe, harvest and haul onions.
   In 1991, when his current ID card expires, Fierro will be
notified he's eligible to apply for permanent residency ``if he has
been an upstanding citizen and a member in good standing of our
society,'' said INS spokesman Duke Austin in Washington, D.C.
   ``Then he will have to have permanent immigrant status for five
years before he can apply for naturalization to become a United
States citizen,'' said Austin. ``The earliest that could happen is
1996.''
   Fierro, who was an illegal alien for 30 years, said now that it's
actually possible, he often wonders what it would like to be an
American citizen.
   ``It is a big step,'' he said through his interpreter,
``especially learning the English. But why not? I still have many
years left!''

   ``A Cry in the Dark''
   
   A deeply religious Australian family goes on a camping vacation
at the site of Ayers Rock, which rises like a monstrous carbuncle
from the flat, desolate land. One evening the wife returns to the
tent in time to see a dingo, a wild dog of the outback, escape into
the darkness. The nine-week-old baby Azaria is missing.
   Search of the surrounding territory fails to locate the baby. The
sorrowing couple returns home and discovers the disappearance has
become a national sensation. Television and the tabloid press raise
doubts about the mother's story, and she is arrested on a charge of
murder. Pregnant with her fourth child, she is convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor.
   A grim, harrowing story that happens to be true. The events are
told with apparent fidelity in the Warner Bros. release ``A Cry in
the Dark,'' starring Meryl Streep and Sam Neill and directed by Fred
Schepisi. The screenplay was written by Schepisi and Robert Caswell,
taken from John Bryson's book, ``Evil Angels.''
   Meryl Streep as Lindy Chamberlain adds another of her impeccable
portrayals of tormented women, this time affecting an Australian
accent. Curiously, it is her performance itself that prevents ``A
Cry in the Dark'' from becoming a completely absorbing film. Her
Lindy is so cool and sardonic that she repells sympathy rather than
attracts it (this reportedly was true with the real-life defendant).
   Sam Neill contributes a well-shaded portrait of a husband
perplexed and bewildered by the onrush of events. Schepisi's
direction matches the heaviness of the story. He seems obsessed by
the imagery of the huge rock, the significance of which is not
readily apparent. The venality of the news media, while perhaps
historically accurate, also seems overplayed.
   Despite its deficiencies, ``A Cry in the Dark'' is a valuable and
courageous document, showing how ignorance and hysteria can inflame
a ruinous miscarriage of justice. Only this September was Lindy
Chamberlain finally cleared of all charges. That is noted in a
postscript to the movie, added just before the release.
   Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus were executive producers, and
Verity Lambert produced, with Roy Stevens as line producer. The
rating is PG, with scary elements for the very young. Running time:
121 minutes.

   ``U2 Rattle and Hum''
   
   In the age of MTV, the concert film has become superfluous
self-parody. U2, the sometimes insufferably self-righteous rock
conscience of the 1980s, also flirts dangerously with the line over
which lies unintentional comedy.
   It took a young, relatively inexperienced director, 26-year-old
Phil Joanou, to walk this tightrope, oblivious to the lack of a net.
   ``U2 Rattle and Hum'' is an unself-conscious, visually thrilling
concert film that honors the music, but also reveals the boys in the
band _ lead singer Bono, guitarist The Edge, bassist Adam Clayton
and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. _ as less self-important than
reassuringly self-deprecating.
   Most of the film, shot during U2's ``Joshua Tree'' tour last
year, is in beautiful black and white. Concert films can be
cloyingly arty in the filming, but Joanou lays down an unobtrusive
visual back-beat for his stars _ until it's time to take the lead,
and when the camera work is center stage, it's dazzling. Joanou also
did his own editing.
   Thankfully there are none of those
sitting-around-the-hotel-suite-rapping scenes. When Joanou does try
to interview the band, they giggle and stammer what they know to be
hopeless banalities, such as, ``It's a musical journey.''
   Other behind-the-scenes are quite touching. During a visit to
Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Mullen struggles
earnestly to explain why he liked the Elvis movies that hipper types
disdained. Bono, like an indulgent papa, sweet-talks the tour guide
into letting Mullen have his picture taken sitting aboard one of
Elvis' motorcycles.
   The Edge provides Buster Keaton-like comic relief _ though he is
quite articulate when asked to talk about the film or the music.
Backstage just before an encore, huffing and puffing Bono shouts at
him, ``Not on the first verse, not on the second verse, on the third
verse!'' When B.B. King joins the band onstage in Fort Worth, he and
Bono walk the stage in rehearsal. ``I'm no good at chords,'' King
says. ``You'll have to get somebody else to do chords.'' Bono
mutters, ``Edge can do it.''
   The title of the movie is from one of the songs that first seared
the band into U.S. consciousness, ``Bullet the Blue Sky.'' The
band's political message is more sophisticated than the usual
oh-wow-man-heavy rock dose. Ironically, when Bono is flinging
himself around the stage, it's hard to concentrate on the message
when thinking, ``Nice hair.''
   Bono does allow himself to be upstaged, though, as on a trip to a
Harlem church where the New Voices of Freedom sing ``I Still Haven't
Found What I'm Looking For'' as a gospel song, or B.B. King's duet
on ``When Love Comes to Town,'' a song Bono wrote for the blues
great when he came to Ireland.
   The true test of a concert film is, after all, its concert
footage, and the friendly preview crowd at a Times Square theater
thought it was _ they cheered after every number.

   Videos Reviewed this week: ``Anna,'' ``Two Moon Junction,''
``Opera Do Milandro,'' ``Little Nikita.''
   
   ``Anna'' (Vestron Video; VHS-Beta, $79.98; Rated PG-13)
   
   Sally Kirkland was nominated for an Academy Award _ and
deservedly so _ for her portrayal of an aging Czech actress in
``Anna,'' but this gritty film needs more than her extraordinary
performance to carry it.
   Directed by Yurek Bogayevicz, the movie tells the story of Anna,
an actress who was a great star in her native Czechoslovakia before
being forced into permanent exile in America.
   In New York she is forced to endure degrading auditions for bit
parts, her choice of roles limited by her age and her accent. In an
early scene she hops in circles on one foot, screaming the words to
``Humpty-Dumpty'' to one director's bidding. She winds up being the
understudy.
   Enter Krystyna, a young Czech woman who has followed Anna's
career from afar. She comes to New York, tracks Anna to an audition,
asks to be her maid, then faints from hunger. Anna, touched by the
young woman's adulation, takes her in and begins to school her in an
acting career.
   Krystyna, played by the achingly beautiful model Paulina
Porizkova in her film debut, soon learns English, has her rotting
teeth capped, and finds that acting roles drop at her feet with
little effort on her part. Her youth and her beauty are her only
ticket, and she proves a quick study in cashing in on them.
   Predictably, Anna's star falls as fast as Krystyna's rises, and
here lies the chief flaw of the film: Agnieszka Holland's screenplay
is full of such strained parallels. The movie gets very preachy and
stagy so as to better draw the viewer's attention to the injustice
of youth's trampling of experience.
   The ending is absolutely implausible, but so are so many scenes
leading up to it that it hardly comes as a surprise.
   Porizkova, with her finely chiseled features and low-key
performance, is perfect as Krystyna, both savvy and innocent at the
same time. Robert Fields has a thankless role as Daniel, the
sometime-lover of Anna who is still financially dependent on his
parents as he enters middle age.

   ``Two Moon Junction'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video;
VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated R)
   
   Someone once told Sherilyn Fenn she looked a little like Marilyn
Monroe and maybe she ought to be in pictures. You remember Sherilyn,
she was in those two memorable movies, ``The Wild Life'' and ``Just
One of the Guys.'' What? You don't remember? You didn't see them?
You don't know who she is? Tsk. Tsk.
   Then maybe you should keep your record unblemished and skip ``Two
Moon Junction'' as well. It's a seedy little movie filled with fake
erotica and silliness, most perpetrated by our little Marilyn clone.
   Fenn plays April Delongpre, a Southern debutante about to marry
one as equally as privileged as she. The wedding is a big affair
patterned after ``Alice in Wonderland.'' Indeed, April looks
wistfully a her friends, as she clicks together a pair of ballet toe
shoes (perhaps she expects her wedding party to pirouette?), and
says she's always dreamed of a story book weeding.
   Then she meets a carny, and as the publicity hype puts it:
``sparks ignite into flames of passion.'' Their passion is as hot
and appealing as cold grits, and they go through their story with
the speed of molasses. You also can pretty much predict the outcome,
and you also know what evil lurks behind the fatherly smile of Burl
Ives, here a small-town sheriff. Zalman King directed this mess and
also wrote the screenplay.
   With the exception of a perky and much too brief cameo by Kristy
McNichol, you can skip this one.

   ``Opera Do Milandro'' (Virgin Vision, VHS-Beta, $59.95, not rated)
   
   The Brazilian ``Opera Do Milandro'' is a blending of ``Guys 'n
Dolls'' with ``Threepenny Opera'' and set to a samba beat.
   This handsome movie recreates the atmosphere of the era's
soundstage melodramas and musicals, which were especially popular in
Latin America, and it percolates with sambas and tangos and ballads
and little pop songs that are still echoing when the next one begins.
   Director Ruy Guerra shares screenplay credit with Orlando Senna
and playwright Chico Buarque who also wrote the music and lyrics.
   Edson Celulari plays Max Overseas, a handsome good-for-nothing
hood who joyfully lives off the earnings of Margot (Elba Ramalho),
the B-girl with a heart of gold and former girlfriend of Tiger the
policeman (Ney Latorraca).
   With Tiger gunning for him, Max gets Margot fired by Nazi-loving
cabaret owner Otto Strudell (J.C. Violla) then seduces Otto's
gorgeous daughter Ludmilla (Claudia Ohana). The situation gets
desperate and then everything is miraculously resolved _ almost _ in
the final scene.
   ``Opera Do Milandro'' clicks effortlessly. It's a sad, romantic
and funny and visually engaging. If you like Brazilian music, you'll
love the movie. If you like musicals, grab this one.

   ``Little Nikita'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95;
Rated PG)
   
   Jeff Grant is a typical Southern California teen who likes the
usual things: girls, cars, hanging out with his buddies. He also has
applied to the Air Force Academy and can hardly wait to be a flyboy.
   Only one teensy, tiny hitch: His mommy and daddy are Soviet
spies. It seems they came to the United States in the 1960s as
sleepers _ deep, deep cover agents who carry on a normal life in
their target country until they are called into service by mother
Russia.
   Enter FBI superagent Roy Parmenter (Sidney Poitier). And here's
where the story gets a little dicey: He tells Jeff (River Phoenix)
his parents are agents and enlists the boy's help in keeping tabs on
them and finding what they're up to. To make matters worse, the
parents have been enlisted by a KGB agent trying to stop a killer
Soviet spy. Unfortunately, it all comes across as jibberish. The
plot could work if only it had been better developed by
screenwriters John Hill and Bo Goldman, and better handled by
director Richard Benjamin.
   Poitier and crew do their best to work with improbable situations
and trying lines, and manage to provide some light entertainment and
even a thimble full of suspense.

   ``What Up, Dog?'' (Chrysalis) _ Was (Not Was)
   
   Ever wonder what happened to the class clowns in your high
school? In the case of Donald Fagenson and David Weiss, they're now
making records.
   Billing themselves as Donald and David Was, the duo's warped
sense of humor flows through the new album, ``What Up, Dog?''
Fortunately, it's accompanied by some sweet soul music.
   The multi-instrumentalists team with the potent vocal team of
Sweet Pea Atkinson, a gruff bass, and Harry Bowens, a smooth tenor,
to make street-smart music. ``What Up, Dog?'' sounds more consistent
than this group's forgotten 1983 masterpiece, ``Born to Laugh at
Tornadoes,'' but is ultimately less compelling.
   ``Walk the Dinosaur,'' with its ``acka-lacka-boom-boom'' chorus,
is a terrific mindless dance song that, with any luck, should be a
smash.
   Bowers croons the optimistic ``Anything Can Happen,'' with this
irresistible opening couplet: ``She took me in the bedroom to show
me her computer. She asked me if I liked it, I told her she was
cuter.''
   The Was brothers also coax fairly interesting songwriting
contributions from Marshall Crenshaw and Elvis Costello and, on the
compact disc, a vocal performance from Frank Sinatra Jr., of all
people.
   But they include three cuts that are little more than comedy
skits with music backgrounds _ humorous the first time they're
listened to, a drag thereafter. Add them to lackluster tunes such as
``Boy's Gone Crazy'' and ``11 MPH'' _ the latter about John F.
Kennedy's assassination _ and the filler barometer shoots too high.
   Then again, you didn't have to laugh at all your class clown's
jokes to appreciate the effort.

   ``Notes From America'' (Columbia) _ Bonnie Tyler
   
   There's no denying Bonnie Tyler's voice. She could _ should _ be
one of rock's finest female vocalists, with her husky growl that
echoes both Janis Joplin and Tina Turner.
   The presence of such an extraordinary voice makes ``Notes From
America'' worth listening to, but unfortunately the material Tyler
uses and the overblown production on the record make it very, very
ordinary.
   Tyler first hit both pop and country charts 10 years ago with
``It's a Heartache'' and, five years later, had a No. 1 single with
``Total Eclipse of the Heart.''
   Since then, the Welsh-born Tyler has recorded sparingly. On
``Notes From America,'' she teams up with producer-songwriter
Desmond Child, who is known for his work with Bon Jovi and
Aerosmith. The aim is to create big hits. What results is big, and
it might be a hit, but it doesn't do justice to Tyler's abilities.
   The album is overproduced at nearly every turn. ``Don't Turn
Around,'' for instance, is a ballad that starts off as a wonderful
showcase for Tyler's tough yet vulnerable voice. But as it builds to
a crescendo (as many songs on ``Notes From America'' do) and a choir
chimes in, the core of the song is lost in a tidal wave of sound.
   The title track features 50 people corralled on the streets of
Woodstock, N.Y., where the album was made, to sing backup. Why only
50?
   Other tunes stand up better. ``Hide Your Heart'' is a hook-filled
rocker dominated by snarling guitars, while ``Take Another Look at
My Heart'' is a lighter, keyboard-based piece that allows Tyler to
stand out. She even does a version of the Bee Gees' ``To Love
Somebody'' that's better than the original.
   One song stands head and shoulders above the rest. An old Janis
Joplin tune, ``Turtle Blues,'' is a wonderful blues-rocker that
shows the vocal phrasing, range and power of which Tyler is capable.
   ``Notes From America'' sounds like much of the commercial rock
'n' roll on the radio these days. It might make Tyler richer, but
it's a shame such a voice isn't singing more memorable music.

   ``Land of Dreams'' (Reprise) _ Randy Newman
   
   Randy Newman, the songwriter with humor dark enough to make jokes
about short people, has returned with a rich, complex album that's
easily one of the most pleasant surprises of the year.
   ``Land of Dreams'' is full of sharply drawn characters, cutting
emotion and, of course, humor. Newman, on his ninth album, again
shows he is a deft and perceptive composer.
   Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits and Electric Light Orchestra's Jeff
Lynne produced and played on much of the album, which also features
an appearance by Tom Petty. But things are dominated by Newman's
calliope-like piano and Delta-accented voice.
   Side 1 is purely autobiographical. ``Dixie Flyer'' deals with
Newman's early move to New Orleans, the ``land of dreams.'' In the
ragtime ``New Orleans Wins the War,'' his father returns from World
War II, but not before his mother teaches him some things about life:
   ``She said, `Here comes a white boy-there goes a black one-that
one's an octoroon-this little cookie here's a macaroon-that big
round thing's a red balloon-and the paper down here's called the
Picayune ... '''
   On ``Four Eyes,'' Newman deals with the terrors of his first day
of school: ``You're not gonna leave me here, are you?'' he wails to
his father.
   Three songs deal with love and love lost. ``Falling in Love'' has
a whimsical, catchy hook that captures the happiness of the feeling.
The relationship matures on the evocative ``Something Special,'' but
then is destroyed on ``Bad News From Home,'' a desolate piano piece
about betrayal.
   Side 2 is more light-hearted, starting with ``Roll With the
Punches,'' a satirical look at how some people would solve the
problems of the poor and hungry:
   ``I say we ain't gotta do nothin' for nobody-cause they won't
work a lick you know-they just gonna have to roll with the punches,
yes they will.''
   ``Masterman and Baby J'' is a rap sendup, but with a vein of
sympathy for people trapped in ghettos with nothing but dreams of
stardom to keep their ugly world from ensnaring them.
   The hit song ``It's Money That Matters'' features a rolling
Knopfler lick and a semi-serious lyric about what it takes to make
it in America. And ``I Want You to Hurt Like I Do'' ends the record
on a quiet note of domestic pain.
   ``Land of Dreams'' rings true. While much of it may be drawn from
Newman's own life, in the telling of his stories he tells us about
ourselves.

<TEXT>
   Sam Neill was born in Northern Ireland, grew
up in New Zealand, first achieved notice in Australian films, and
became well known in American television. A suitable path to
international stardom.
   With his strong features and unaccented English, Neill is a
self-proclaimed citizen of the world, living in London with an
apartment in Sydney and a mountain hideaway in New Zealand. He was
recently here to help launch his new film with Meryl Streep, ``A Cry
in the Dark.'' A quiet-spoken man, he is nevertheless forceful in
his opinions.
   ``A Cry in the Dark'' is based on a real-life cause celebre that
occupied the Australian public for several years. The wife of a
Seventh Day Adventist churchman declared that her nine-week-old
daughter had been snatched from the family's camping tent by a wild
dog known as the dingo. Because of a flimsy set of circumstantial
evidence, the woman was charged with murdering the baby.
   The media exploited the case, stirring up emotions that
apparently continue today despite the fact that the wife, played by
Meryl Streep, was finally cleared of all charges after serving three
years of a life imprisonment for murder.
   ``Anyone who has been to Australia in the last eight years knows
of this case,'' Neill said, ``because of the enormous controversy
the whole thing stirred up. I didn't feel as involved with it as
others who were more familiar with the case, because most of the
time I was living in England.
   ``I was completely flabbergasted by the extent that people were
excited or angered. They were completely involved in the case. Their
opinions are not simply mild; they were extremely black and white.
And they still are, about whether or not these people are guilty or
innocent of this crime.''
   The actor jumped at the chance to rejoin Streep and director Fred
Schepisi, with whom he had worked in ``Plenty.'' But he admitted
that the role of Michael Chamberlain presented the biggest challenge
of his career.
   ``I was scared before we started, terrified,'' he said with a
nervous laugh. ``It was certainly a departure from anything I've
ever done. I was encouraged when I learned that Meryl was just as
frightened as I was.
   ``I had met Michael Chamberlain, and it became apparent that this
was a dual-edged thing. I realized that I couldn't take liberties
with his character or his personality or his story. This meant that
I had to act responsibly. Most acting is a sort of jump of the
imagination. This was not fiction. We're talking about (the
Chamberlains') lives and reputations, and their futures, too. So we
had to do it right.''
   Neill's indeterminate accent is due to his lifelong travels
through the English-speaking world. He was born in Northern Ireland,
where his father was a member of an Irish regiment of the British
army. His father retired when Sam was eight and the family settled
in New Zealand. As an outsider in a colonial environment, he
overcame his shyness by becoming an actor.
   ``I saw a lot of American films, and British films, too,'' he
recalled. ``Films, cars and rock 'n' roll music have been the
primary American export of the past 30 years or so. When I was
growing up we had no television; that came very late to New Zealand.
So we were raised on a diet of films that were made within a four-
or five-mile radius of this very hotel (the Beverly Hills).''
   After college, Neill began making documentary movies, then was
cast by director Roger Donaldson (``The Bounty,'' ``Marie'') in a
modest film called ``Sleeping Dogs.'' That led to ``My Brilliant
Career,'' one of the first films in the Australian movie boom that
has produced such actors as Mel Gibson, Bryan Brown and Paul Hogan,
directors Bruce Beresford, Fred Schepisi, Donaldson and others.
   In explaining the creative surge, Neill commented: ``What we have
in Australia is a very vigorous, young society with young ideas, and
the film industry is part of that. In some ways, it's the cutting
edge of that.''
   In 1980, Neill's life was changed by a telephone call. Out of the
blue the late actor James Mason called him from Switzerland to tell
him: ``You should be working overseas. I'm sending you a plane
ticket to come to London. There's a film I think you should try out
for.''
   The young actor flew from Sydney to London and won the role of
the satanic Damien in ``The Final Conflict,'' last of three ``The
Omen'' movies. That led to his portrayal of the legendary Sidney
Reilly in the acclaimed British TV miniseries, ``Reilly: Ace of
Spies.'' He has also appeared in other miniseries such as ``Kane and
Abel'' and ``Amerika,'' as well as such features as ``Possession,''
``Enigma,'' ``Leap of Faith,'' ``The Good Wife'' and next, ``Dead
Calm.''

<HEAD>The Artists: A Hail and Possible Farewell for Ailey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alvin Ailey approaches a joyous celebration of
the 30th anniversary of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater on
Dec. 7, after being honored by the Kennedy Center for Performing
Arts three days earlier.
   Along with pride in his integrated modern dance company's
accomplishments, far-flung touring, a satisfying outreach program in
Kansas City and honors for all of it, he also faces his company's
possible demise.
   ``I'm facing a 30-year season with the possibility this will all
fall apart in the 30th year,'' Ailey said. The company's 10-year
lease on 20,000 square feet of office, studio and school space in
the Minskoff Theater Building on Broadway ends next May.
   ``We came in during a real estate slump,'' said William Hammond,
company executive director, who sat in on an interview with Ailey in
his office. ``Now real estate is booming. They want to move to
commercial rates. It's impossible. We've got the best dance studios
in the city. It would be a shame for the studios to be put to office
space. It would be a shame for the company to go out of business.''
Hammond has been looking, so far unsuccessfully, for other quarters.
   ``Without a place to be, it is difficult to be in business,'' he
said. ``We've got a great school. The city is helpful but no space
is available for three or four years. The problem is keeping alive
between now and then, without space or an angel or patron.'' He has
considered moving the company out of New York.
   While worrying about that, Ailey is choreographing and running a
company. His ``Opus McShann,'' to music by 72-year-old Kansas City
jazz pianist Jay McShann, received its premiere Nov. 4 in Kansas
City.
   When Ailey receives Kennedy Center Honors on Dec. 4, along with
comedian George Burns, actress Myrna Loy, violinist Alexander
Schneider and arts producer Roger Stevens, his company will dance.
It'll probably be sections from ``Revelations,'' Ailey's stirring
choreography to spirituals.
   The Kennedy Center Honors show will be televised on CBS Dec. 30
as a General Motors ``mark of excellence'' presentation.
   Ailey returned to New York on election day after seven weeks with
his company in Europe and two weeks in Kansas City.
   The Kansas City engagement, which has occured every other year
since 1984, is close to Ailey's heart because the company enters the
community, dancing by day for children, the elderly and prisoners,
and giving evening concerts.
   ``We came through Kansas City on tour to play two nights in 1982.
There was a group called the Gentlemen of Distinction, 21 young
black businessmen. They asked what I really wanted to do. I said,
`To go into a community and take the dance to people,''' Ailey
recalled.
   ``They have to raise a lot of money to do this and they do it.
The Kansas City Friends of Alvin Ailey have functions all year
round. It brings together racial segments which would ordinarily
never speak to each other, to socialize and plan together. It's a
very good thing for the city.
   ``The audience in Kansas City is very sweet and thinks we're
wonderful and every step we do is special. But the most interesting
thing is dividing the 28 dancers into groups of three or four and
sending them out to two or three places a day. They do introductory
dance classes at elementary schools.''
   In one section of ``Opus McShann'' Ailey said, there's an
interruption by the Ku Klux Klan. ``I couldn't get off without some
kind of social comment. Missouri in the '30s was rife with the Ku
Klux Klan.
   ``I worked on it a lot in Paris. We had five days of rehearsal in
Paris, trying to put some edges together. We'll have a week of
rehearsal before New York. A week of rehearsal is like a gold mine.
There's never enough time to do anything. We rehearse constantly on
the road, in hotel rooms and hallways.''
   The company started in 1958 with unpaid dancers and no real place
to dance.
   ``We saw the dance explosion happen,'' he said. ``We were part of
it and helped the surge. We saw the Civil Rights movement, the
National Endowment for the Arts start in 1966 and the responsibility
for the arts passed on to corporations, which can work in strange
ways.
   ``The touring program of the National Endowment, which gave
presenters a third of the company's fee, did a lot to further dance
in this country. We've been struggling since they dissolved it in
the early '80s.''
   Looking back over his company's accomplishments, Ailey said
they've accomplished a tremendous amouth.
   ``We've done a lot of fantastic things,'' he said. ``I really am
happy about that. We toured more than anybody. We were the first
contemporary dance to go into Russia in 1971 and the first into
China in 1985. We started in Europe in 1964, three weeks in Paris
and six weeks in London. We spent five summers touring in major
European festivals.
   ``We'd dissolve every time we got back. We'd come back together
or I'd get new dancers when we got work. Colleges got interested in
us. We spend five months a year touring to colleges and
communities.''
   Finally, Ailey says what his company is all about: ``We're trying
to project the idea of the expressive possibilities of movement _
metaphors, implications, what dance can say to one's interior and
sensitivity.
   ``The dances should have good taste, should not be overly
commercial. We should dance about ordinary people. Our heritage
should be celebrated in the dance. Bringing back modern dance
classics isn't as easy as one would hope. Funding agencies are only
interested in what is new.''
   Last year's reconstruction of an evening of Katharine Dunham
dances, with her help, cost $500,000 and had donations from the Ford
and Doris Duke foundations. The first act was performed in Paris
this year and Ailey hopes money will be raised to take it to
California on this winter's tour.
   ``I decided it would be in part a company to preserve black
choreography and music, with the idea of enlarging the minority
audience. I put dancers of different races together. The audience
could applaud the effort of black and white working together.''
   Ailey also encourages new choreographers. The upcoming season
will include a new dance by Rovan Deon, a student at the Ailey
school.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Taking Comfort In Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With so much to worry about these days, Americans
are bellying up to the table to find solace in foods that stir
memories as much as taste buds.
   So-called comfort foods can be delicious but don't have to be,
can be healthy but generally are not, can be down-home but might be
very special. What they have in common is an ability to tug at the
heart strings.
   Among the first to recognize the lure of comfort foods were Jane
and Michael Stern. Their 1984 ``Square Meals'' cookbook was an early
sign that the foods from which baby boomers fled were again becoming
the foods for which they yearned.
   Several new books, including a new one by the Sterns, show the
interest has not waned.
   ``There's a kind of spiritual nutriment to be found in honest
food that doesn't take itself so seriously, that's an expression of
the way people really live,'' Stern said in a telephone interivew.
``That has been our soapbox since before we did `Square Meals.'''
   In their new book, ``A Taste of America'' (Andrews and McMeel,
$16.95), a compilation of their syndicated columns, the Sterns roam
the country in search of honest food. They stop to sample ``Bowl of
the Wife of Kit Carson'' stew in Morrison, Colo.; the ``Golden
Noodle Bake,'' served at the L.S. Ayres Department Store in
Indianapolis; or the fried okra from Ruth and Jimmie's Sporting
Goods and Cafe in Abbeville, Miss.
   ``A Taste of America'' provides the flavor of more than the food,
as each recipe has a story _ of the cook, the town or the dish.
   In ``Comfort Foods'' (Donald I. Fine Inc., $16.95), Holly
Garrison also takes a trip, this one back in time, with recipes and
anecdotes of canned vegetables and processed cheese, marshmallows
and white bread.
   Unhealthy, certainly. But comfort foods generally are ``older
recipes, before people became aware how unhealthy some of these
foods are if you eat too much of them,'' said Garrison.
   So she provides ``heart preserver tips,'' though for fudge, she
writes, ``There are none. Fudge is not heart-healthy food.''
   Garrison recommends moderation rather than abstinence, and
sometimes can't resist her own favorite of ``Granny's Greatest
Hits'' _ fried chicken, especially with mashed potatoes and gravy.
   Probably the best-known comfort food is chicken soup, ``revered
for its curative and restorative powers,'' Garrison writes. Among
the other common foods she includes are chicken stew with dumplings,
mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallows and strawberry shortcake.
   As Garrison writes, it is not always the food but the emotions it
elicits: ``Once upon a time, a plump roast chicken for Sunday dinner
was the ultimate symbol of prosperity and well-being in America. How
bad could things be when we were surrounded by a loving, happy
family seated together at the big dining room table so loaded with
serving dishes, platters and plates of food that the tablecloth was
barely visible?''
   Stern said he and his wife began writing about comfort foods
``out of a sense of being fed up with overly pretentious overly
fancy, overly expensive food.''
   ``I think what happened is that the much-vaunted culinary
revolution of the late '70s nd early '80s just went so far that
everyone started to feel what Jane and I were feeling,'' he said.
``Food ought to be something that makes you feel good, not something
that intimidates you.''
   Author Karen Brown was a victim of that revolution.
   ``I was a yuppie cook,'' she said. ``I could do a beautiful
dessert souffle and impress my dates.'' But she couldn't make pot
roast.
   When her son was born seven years ago, she looked to the food of
her childhood. Many of those recipes appear in ``Mommy Meals''
(Legacy Marketing, $9.95), a month's worth of menus for foods many a
'50s mother put on her table _ pot roast, banana pudding,
carrot-raisin salad, pumpkin pie.
   Brown, a 36-year-old working single mother in Dallas, said her
book is written for the woman who's on a first-name basis with her
pizza delivery men.
   ``When mine knew all these personal things about my life, I knew
he was there once too often,'' she joked. ``Since we're so busy ...
there's a little guilt that we're not giving our children all that
we had, and food is one way to do that.''
   If comfort food mixes the tummy and the heart, then the ultimate
comfort meal for many must be Christmas dinner, and in ``Christmas
Memories With Recipes'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22.50), 25 food
writers share food and spirit.
   ``The menus never varied much from year to year, which was, now
that I reflect upon it, part of the reassuring warmth of the
season,'' Bryan Miller writes.
   ``It is the rituals that count more than anything,'' writes Irena
Chalmers. ``Basically, we hold hands with the generations past but
forge our own unique links in the chain of memories.''
   Edna Lewis recalls that her childhood feasts in Freetown, Va.,
began in September, when children would gather black walnuts,
hickory nuts and hazelnuts. ``Using a nut pick or sometimes a
hairpin, we'd pry the nutmeat from the shell _ rich, flavorful
nutmeats that, even on those warm, bright days, filled us with happy
anticipation beause we knew they would be baked into delicious
Christmas cakes and cookies.''
   Some of the joy was born of hardship. Marcella Hazan recounts the
Christmas her family returned to their farm in Italy at the end of
World War II, a year when the food served was the only gift.
   ``As a special gift for my father, Mother rose earlier than
anyone else to bake ciambella, a breakfast cake ... (that) is now my
husband's, as it was my father's, favorite thing to have with a
large morning coffee.''
   And Betty Fusell tells of a Great Depression Christmas Eve dinner
of scrambled eggs and brains: ``In our house this was not a
sophisticated French dish cloaked with capers and beurre noir, but
poverty food _ cheap and, to most of my friends, disgusting. To me
brains were lovely, not only for their creamy softness but because
they redeemed the plain scrambled eggs that were our common everyday
supper. Little did I dream that eggs fresh from the nest, annealed
with nothing but sweet butter, would in my adult years be scarce as
hen's teeth and precious as repentance.''
   In 20 years more, what foods will today's kids find comforting?
   ``It's hard to say, something Mommy fixes or Grandma fixes. It's
not the food but the association,'' said Garrison.
   ``Maybe granola. Maybe McDonalds,'' said Stern.
   But the precise food is hardly the point, so long as it brings
comfort, a sense of tradition and peace.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Chet Atkins Plays Guitar To Stay Happy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran musician Chet Atkins says he gets
depressed unless his nimble fingers are dancing along the neck of a
guitar.
   The 64-year-old performer, known as ``Mr. Guitar,'' is staying
happy by playing his instrument well past the 40-year milestone in
his career.
   This fall he won the Country Music Association musician of the
year award for the ninth time. He has a new album, ``Chet Atkins,
C.G.P,'' which stands for ``certified guitar player.'' He performs
frequently with Garrison Keillor, the former host of the radio show
``Prairie Home Companion.'' And he has released an instructional
video, ``Get Started on Guitar With Chet Atkins.''
   ``To me playing the guitar is like some people who enjoy a meal
and a dessert,'' he said. ``I remember my boss at RCA when they
would bring the dessert tray and he'd look at it like it was a
pretty girl.
   ``I think guitar playing to me is that way. I see a guitar and
imagine the tunes I can play on it and I kind of get ecstatic and
excited like my boss when he looked at that dessert tray.
   ``If I'm not working on a project, I get depressed. I think I'm
not accomplishing anything and I get mad at the world.''
   Atkins' album, approximately his 80th, includes a duet with Dire
Straits' Mark Knopfler on John Lennon's ``Imagine.'' Atkins also
plays a jazzy version of the 1960's pop hit, ``What a Day for a
Daydream,'' and does a rare vocal performance on the ballad, ``I
Still Can't Say Goodbye.''
   But he didn't have to work much on ``Imagine.''
   ``It's a beautiful melody. There's no use improvising too much
and leading the listener astray.''
   Even though he's sold more than 30 million records, he says he
still finds it necessary to practice playing the instrument he
learned as he grew up in rural poverty in the Clinch Mountains of
east Tennessee.
   ``I've got to. It's like typing or playing tennis or golf. If you
don't do it every three or four days, you can't do it. I try to
practice a little bit every week and learn new things. If you don't,
you get so you conform too much and you become very predictable,''
he said.
   ``It's a constant learning process because the music keeps
changing due to the entrance of young people into music. They
introduce a lot of new ideas. To stay a little bit contemporary
requires a lot of listening and a lot of work; no, not work, but
play. It's always been play to me.''
   He says he still makes mistakes while playing even though he's
been coaxing melodies out of the instrument for more than 50 years.
   ``But you learn to cover up those things. All notes, all
dissonance, leads to something else. That's the reason music is
beautiful. Music is dissonance always resolved.
   ``Any note you play is one half-tone away from something that
will work if you improvise. So if I hit a bad note, I just go up or
down a half tone and it sounds like I meant to do it,'' Atkins said.
   He's so dedicated to the guitar that years ago he named his
daughter Merle after fellow guitarist Merle Travis.
   ``For some reason, the guitar gave me a passion to play it that
will follow me to the grave. I just loved the sound of the chords
and the romance and the shape of the guitar.
   ``My older brother played the guitar, and I thought it was such a
romantic, beautiful instrument. My dad was a professional music
teacher and he didn't want me to play guitar because he didn't think
there was any future in it.
   ``Of course, I rebelled like all kids do. If kids listened to
their parents, there would never be any progress because they want
you to stick with the status quo.''
   He owns about 30 guitars, but doesn't consider himself a
collector.
   ``I don't have room in my little home. It's better to collect
gold or diamonds; it doesn't take up as much space.''
   He and Keillor performed together in 1987 on Keillor's final
broadcast of ``Prairie Home Companion.'' They have appeared together
often and are scheduled to perform at Carnegie Hall in early 1989.
   ``I enjoy working with him and standing and watching him
entertain in his very unusual way,'' Atkins said.
   ``I hope to continue what I do: playing a few concerts, making
records, ducking when the grim reaper swings at me and get on the
back porch and pick with my friends.''

<HEAD>`Crying' Author Flooded With Letters From Tearful, Tearless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tearful and tearless both cry on
William Frey's shoulder.
   Among those seeking Frey's help since he published ``Crying: The
Mystery of Tears'' three years ago were a woman whose husband
alternated bouts of tears and laughter, and a restaurateur whose
cooks cried chopping onions.
   For the restaurant owner, the answer was easy and time-honored:
Chop the onions under a mist of water.
   Other times, it's more complicated.
   Frey advised Anne Firebaugh, 64, who divides her year between
Nanoose Bay, British Columbia, and Alta Sierra, Calif., to take her
husband Joseph, 71, to a neurologist. Mrs. Firebaugh said Frey's
ideas reassured her belief _ scorned by some doctors _ that there
was more to her husband's problems than runaway emotions. She
learned that he is suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease.
   Frey believes tears are a body's way of getting rid of chemicals
produced by strong emotion.
   ``To get confirmation from someone who has made a study of this,
that was very important to me,'' said Mrs. Firebaugh. ``He is
someone I can look to for help and guidance.''
   Frey, of the Dry Eye and Tear Research Center at St. Paul-Ramsey
Medical Center, receives and answers letters nearly every week from
people, including many men, concerned about tears or lack of them.
   They get a sympathetic response because Frey knows the
frustration of being unable to cry.
   His mother suggested the line of inquiry when he was a graduate
student in the early 1970s in search of a research project. He was
spurred by curiosity over his own lack of emotional tears since he
was a child.
   ``Once scientifically I started thinking about this, I started to
realize this could be a very important process for us as humans. I
became dissatisfied with what I had been satisfied, which was the
fact I didn't cry very easily or very often,'' he said.
   ``So I went and talked to a psychologist. First trying to
convince a psychologist that this is a problem worth dealing with is
not easy.''
   But Frey eventually found someone who thought he had a worthwhile
concern and helped him sort out his feelings. He estimates he now
cries four times a month, even if his eyes only well up with tears.
   ``I hear things on the news or I read things in the paper or I
hear something on National Public Radio or whatever. Whereas I used
to not have any tears or cry, I will cry about it now, because I
allow myself to do it.''
   The identities of the key substances removed in tears still elude
him, partly because he may have made a conceptual error early in his
experiments.
   ``I thought we could take emotional tears ... and that we could
compare those to tears that were produced by eye irritation. But the
thing that I have come to realize lately is that when people tear in
response to eye irritation, there is quite a bit of stress involved
actually. When you're sitting there inhaling vapors from freshly cut
onion, your eyes burn really a lot. You're feeling pain, stress.''
   His research backed that up, showing the same three biochemicals
are present in both kinds of tears. They are leucine-enkephalin, an
endorphin, and the hormones prolactin and Adrenocorticotropic
hormone, known as ACTH. But he doesn't know in what amounts and is
working on a way to determine that.
   Tears also have a lot of material, such as wetting agents, which
have interfered with his chemical methods of measurements.
   ``One thing we're interested in is trying to understand what is
the biochemical basis of emotion and stress, what happens to us when
we have changes in our emotions and our affect,'' Frey said.
   ``If we really understood the biochemistry of stress and emotion,
we might be able to figure out what's going wrong in people who have
emotional disorders.''
   So far though, his research has been confined to the tears of
people who are sad, not the clinically depressed. Emotional tears
are collected in the laboratory by showing poignant scenes from sad
movies. ``Brian's Song,'' ``The Champ'' and ``All Mine To Give''
have proven to be reliable tear-jerkers.
   In his book, Frey wrote that Margaret Crepeau at the University
of Pittsburgh School of Nursing discovered in 1979 that sufferers of
ulcers and colitis, stress-related disorders, cry less often than
healthy people.
   ``This suggests there's some kind of correlation between crying
behavior and susceptibility to stress-related disorders,'' he said.
``It doesn't mean that if you cry, you won't get an ulcer or
anything like that.''
   The flip side of his research could benefit ophthalmology and
sufferers of dry eyes, who number an estimated 2 million to 4
million in the United States, he said. Most sufferers of dry eyes
are postmenopausal women.
   Frey has found women cry on the average of five times a month,
while men generally cry once a month. Other research has shown
little difference in the regularity of emotional crying between boys
and girls under the age of 12.
   ``That's very interesting because, for example, the hormone
prolactin, which I think is probably involved in the sex difference
(in crying) that we see between males and females, is at the same
level in the blood of children,'' Frey said. ``But it's 50 to 60
percent higher in the blood of adult women than in the blood of
adult men.''
   In his book, Frey suggested research to learn whether there are
anatomical differences in the tear glands of men and women. Other
researchers have since reported finding those differences.
   Pregnant women may have erroneously believed they cried more
often because they were more aware of their emotions during
pregnancy, and they may have felt like crying more due to the added
stress of pregnancy.
   People who argue against his excretory theory of the tear gland
generally point out that it lacks the filtering apparatus of the
kidney and ask where the as yet-unidentified waste substances come
from.
   As for the source of the unidentified substances being removed by
the tear gland, he said, ``I suspect that while it might come from
the blood, that there is an equally good chance it might come from
the brain. People forget there's a lot of things still not known
about anatomy.''

<HEAD>Nitrogen Storage Can Help Boost Onion Production and Extend Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIFTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nitrogen atmosphere keeps apples sweet in
storage, and a crop specialist says it could do the same for Vidalia
onions.
   The special storage also could extend the sales season for the
onions from the current six weeks to as long as 32 weeks, said
horticulturist Doyle Smittle at the University of Georgia's Coastal
Plain Experiment Station.
   Growers sell $30 million worth of Vidalia onions from May 1 to
June 15, but about 20 percent of the crop is lost because the onions
can't be stored longer. The pressure to sell forces farmers to
accept lower prices. This year there was an oversupply, and onion
prices dropped below normal.
   Smittle, who has spent five years trying to extend the shelf life
of the world-famous onions, achieved the best results by adapting
the technology used to store apples in Michigan and Washington state.
   Vidalias stored in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide, 3
percent oxygen and 92 percent nitrogen kept their sweetness and mild
taste for months, he said. The humidity must be kept high for
apples, but low for onions.
   Smittle compared the quality of 200 pounds of onions in cold
storage and in a controlled atmosphere for 32 weeks last year. The
lack of oxygen in the atmosphere slows the deterioration of the
onions.
   Eighty-nine percent of the cold-storage onions were rated in good
condition a week after removal from a 34-degree room. Sixty-four
percent were good after two weeks, 48 percent after three weeks, and
28 percent after four weeks.
   Onions kept at 34 degrees in the controlled atmosphere were rated
100 percent good after one week, 98 percent after two weeks, 93
percent after three weeks, and 83 percent at the end of four weeks.
   The tests show that onions kept in just cold storage tended to
lose the mild, sweet taste that Vidalias are known for, Smittle
said. ``The onion bites you after you bite it. In Vidalia, quality
is No. 1. If you don't have quality, the Vidalia name won't mean
anything.''
   The current optimum flow of onions is about 250,000 bags a week
during the harvest season, but if they could be stored through
December 18, farmers would need to grow about six times as many, he
said. He believes the special storage ultimately could provide
consumers with Vidalias for up to 11 months a year.
   Based on Smittle's research, W.J. Grimes, a major grower in
Wheeler County, has begun building a controlled-atmosphere warehouse
for 60,000 bags of onions.
   The warehouse, designed by engineers from Georgia Power Co. and
the Little Ocmulgee Electric Membership Corp., will have
computerized controls and sensors to monitor and adjust the
temperature, humidity and gas concentration hourly.
   Grimes said he has tasted Vidalias stored in a controlled
atmosphere for up to seven months. ``The onion still had its flavor.
There's no use in storing it unless it's going to be a Vidalia
onion. I think there's a future in it.''

<TEXT>
   Sara Moody proudly shows a videotape of her
10-year-old nephew, Stevie Roper, riding his bicycle and raking
leaves with his father.
   Not so long ago, those routine activities could have killed
Stevie, who suffers from hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, a lack
of sweat glands that can cause the body to overheat.
   But a phone call to NASA in July 1987 has led to a new, active
life for Stevie and hope for hundreds who suffer from the same rare
birth defect. An estimated 400 children in the United States suffer
from HED.
   ``All I did was make a phone call and the rest fell into place,''
said Mrs. Moody, 49, a homemaker and president of the HED Foundation
she formed in March. That call, made after Stevie became overheated
in a car and almost died during a vist to Hampton, was to NASA's
Langley Research Center.
   Mrs. Moody got the idea from watching a TV movie about a young
man who lacked an immune system and lived inside a protective bubble
designed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   NASA directed her to Life Support Systems Inc. of Mountain View,
Calif., which helped develop a cooling system for space suits and
now makes ``cool suits'' for firefighters, race car drivers and
nuclear plant workers.
   The company designed a child-sized vest and cap that Stevie could
wear as a personal air conditioner. A portable cooling pack powered
by a battery circulates chilled water through tubes to the vest and
cap.
   Knowing that Stevie's parents in Waynesville, N.C., couldn't
afford the suit, Tootsie Moody designed a poster, collected her dill
pickle jars and set them on counters at PoFolks, a restaurant chain
managed locally by a friend.
   The jars and a fund-raising effort by another friend brought in
more than $5,000. But Life Support Systems agreed to sell the suit
at cost for $2,600, so the rest of the money went for Stevie's care.
   After a brief flurry of publicity about the suit, Mrs. Moody went
home and settled down again. Then the telephone started to ring.
   ``You wouldn't believe the people who started calling that had
this problem. Everybody said, `Look, why don't you form a foundation
and go on to help those other children?' I thought, `Well, why
not?'''
   Since she started the foundation, suits have been delivered to
children in Birmingham, Ala.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Tuscon, Ariz.; and
Kuwait.
   ``Here we were already gone national and now then international,
pow!''
   PoFolks restaurants across the country now have jars to collect
money for the HED Foundation, said Carol Koenig, marketing manager
of the Nashville-based company. The campaign would not have started
without Tootsie Moody, she said.
   ``She is tireless. She just keeps going, will not take no for an
answer. But she does it in a way that doesn't offend anyone.''
   Twenty-seven children are waiting for suits to be made and the
money to be raised to pay for them. The foundation has raised more
than $16,000, most of it spent to buy suits, which also have helped
multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis patients who need to avoid
overheating.
   Aside from helping the children survive, the suits have brought
together HED victims who told Mrs. Moody they had never known anyone
else with the same condition.
   ``It's made a different person out of Stevie as it has these
other people,'' she said. ``They no longer feel like a freak.
They're out as a normal human being except for no sweat glands. I
think it's done good in a lot of different ways.''

<HEAD>Study Says Common Heart Procedure Is Safe for Outpatients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sending some patients home immediately after common
heart catheter tests could reduce the nation's medical bills by
millions of dollars without injuring people's health, a new study
concludes.
   The report estimates that if 15 percent of the 500,000 Americans
who undergo this procedure each year were treated as outpatients
instead of being hospitalized, the savings would be $51 million.
Some of the savings may already have been realized, because many
doctors in recent years have begun performing the procedure without
putting their patients in the hospital for a day or two.
   The study, directed by Dr. Peter C. Block of Massachusetts
General Hospital, was published recently in the New England Journal
of Medicine.
   The doctors compared the experience of 192 patients who were
randomly assigned to have the procedure as outpatients and 189
others who were admitted to the hospital for the test. No one died,
and there were no significant differences in the need for later
hospitalization because of complications.
   While they concluded that doing the procedure on an outpatient
basis is ``feasible and safe,'' they cautioned that only relatively
young and healthy patients should be treated this way. In the study,
patients were not considered for outpatient treatment if they were
elderly or had a variety of common medical conditions, including
heart failure and high blood pressure.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. C. Richard Conti of the
University of Florida said the research provides more evidence that
outpatient procedures are safe and efficient, and the results ``are
applicable to the general population considered at low risk.''
   Cardiac catherization involves inserting a slender tube through
an artery into the heart. Dye is released into the heart, and an
X-ray camera is used to take movies of blood flowing through the
heart arteries. The procedure is widely used to diagnose heart
disease.

<HEAD>AIDS Video Reduces VD Among Navy Crewmen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy sailors were less likely to be
infected by gonorrhea, and probably by the AIDS virus, after a
videotape about AIDS played constantly on their aircraft carrier
three days before shore leave, a doctor says.
   ``The incidence of gonorrhea among the crew dropped 75 percent,
from 16 to four cases per 1,000 men per day,'' said Dr. William O.
Harrison, who created the video program before his retirement last
August as head of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome evaluation
unit at Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego.
   ``If the incidence of sexually transmitted disease is reduced,
then the likelihood of being exposed to the AIDS virus is reduced by
the same amount,'' Harrison said during a recent symposium at the
Long Beach Naval Hospital.
   Harrison cited security rules in declining to name the aircraft
carrier or ports it visited, but said it was one of many ships that
showed the 70-minute video. The carrier's crew, however, was the
only group monitored for sexually transmitted disease rates before
and after the video was shown.
   All Navy personnel are tested for HIV, the AIDS-causing human
immunodeficiency virus, before they are sent overseas.
   ``I can substantiate that the education program works,'' said Lt.
Cmdr. Richard A. Weiner, flight surgeon on the Long Beach-based
ship, Peleliu, which recently returned from the Western Pacific.
   ``We repeatedly showed the educational videotape made by Dr.
Harrison and lectured the crew before pulling into port. There were
no HIV positives (people who tested positive for signs of AIDS
infection) and there was a marked decrease in the rate of sexually
transmitted disease among the crew.''
   The video ``describes case histories and how those people
contracted AIDS and in a simplified way, explains the human immune
system and how HIV affects the body,'' and discusses the risk of
catching AIDS from infected people on active duty, Harrison said.

<HEAD>Vitamin E Seen To Enhance Immune Systems In Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have preliminary evidence that extra
doses of vitamin E may help elderly people ward off disease by
boosting the strength of their disease-fighting immune systems.
   Despite the new evidence, however, doctors say more research will
be necessary before they recommend that people take this nutrient to
stay healthy.
   ``Our goals are to identify whether the elderly ought to take
supplements and to identify the role diet and nutrition play in the
age-related diseases and the immune system,'' said Dr. Jeffrey B.
Blumberg.
   The research was conducted on 32 elderly volunteers at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging
at Tufts University. For a month, half of them got vitamin E
supplements, while the rest took dummy pills.
   Skin tests showed marked enhancement of the immune response in
those getting the vitamin. Their blood also carried more stimulated
white cells that indicate the vigor of the immune system.
   ``Our results show improvements in immune responses of already
healthy people...,'' said Blumberg, chief of the lab where the
research was conducted.
   Some experts believe that a breakdown of the immune system may
contribute to the illnesses that afflict old people, including
cancer and infections. Part of this immune weakness may result from
oxidation, the destructive process that makes iron rust and food
turn rancid.
   Vitamin E is an antioxidant. It consumes the highly reactive
chemical molecules, known as free radicals, that result from
oxidation in the body. Levels of antioxidants in the body seem to
decline with age.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. expects to save
$500,000 a year after an artificial intelligence program taught the
company a thing or two about making the metal tubes that contain
nuclear fuel in reactors.
   Conventional industrial computer programs, called expert systems,
control production by applying known rules for making particular
products. Westinghouse fed the computer raw data from the production
line.
   The ``discovery system,'' as the company calls it, ``looks at its
own performance and says `I produce good tubing or bad tubing, and
if I produce bad tubing using the expert's rules, there's obviously
something missing,''' said researcher Jan Schreurs.
   It helped improve a process at the Blairsville specialty metals
plant in which short, thick zirconium alloy tubing is rolled into
long, thin tubes that hold nuclear fuel pellets in reactor fuel
assemblies.
   The computer discovered that the surface quality of tubing did
not depend simply on the temperature of the fluid used to cool the
rolling machine and the alloy, said Schreurs and Neil Pessall,
another researcher. Another critical factor was the difference in
coolant temperatures on the day the rolling machine was calibrated
and on the days of production.
   A new rule, derived by humans using the findings, says the
temperature can differ up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit before surface
quality deteriorates. Before, the weather was creating temperature
differences of 40 degrees.
   ``This process has been used for about two decades without ever
anybody coming up with a rule,'' Schreurs said, adding that the rule
``had been there all along'' but lay buried in the myriad facts that
only a computer could sort.
   ``The computer does the tedious part of the work, looking at the
same data in a thousand different says. You can do that on paper, of
course, but people get very tired of doing that. They try a few
obvious things, but if they don't find what they're looking for they
give up and forget the data. The computer doesn't get tired, and it
doesn't forget the data.''
   The rule is expected to bring about a 1 percent to 2 percent
increase in the amount of tubing that doesn't need reworking or
adjustments, worth about $500,000 a year in production cost savings,
he said.

<HEAD>Anglo-Dutch Giant Posts 12 Percent Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unilever, the giant Anglo-Dutch household products
group, said Monday its earnings rose 12 percent in the third quarter
on stronger profit margins in both Europe and North America.
   Unilever said its earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30
came to 222 million pounds, the equivalent of $400 million, compared
with 198 million pounds in the same period a year earlier.
   Earnings per share came to 11.90 pence, compared with 10.63 pence
in the 1987 period.
   Sales rose 7 percent to 4.49 billion pounds from 4.2 billion
pounds.
   ``This was a good quarter,'' both in Europe and North America,
Unilever Chairman Michael Angus said.
   Angus attributed a 15 percent rise in operating profit in Europe
to sales of edible fats and detergents, and a 20 percent rise in
North American operating profit to an excellent performance in
specialty chemicals.
   In the first nine months of the year, Unilever's earnings rose 8
percent to 617 million pounds, or 33.06 pence per share, from 570
million pounds, or 30.58 pence per share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales rose 5 percent to 13 billion pounds from 12.4
billion pounds.

<HEAD>EEC Eyes Company To Promote HDTV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community is
considering creating a European company to promote recently
developed technology for a cinema-quality television system, a
senior source said Monday.
   The source, who asked not to be named, said the executive
commission of the EEC was expected to adopt a proposal this week to
create a ``European company for research and promotion'' of
high-definition television (HDTV).
   It would encourage production of shows in HDTV, establish studios
with HDTV technology and organize HDTV demonstrations. Companies of
EEC countries involved in developing HDTV could join the European
venture.
   HDTV produces sharper, brighter images on a wider TV screen with
high-quality sound.
   Demand for HDTV, which promises to bring cinema-quality pictures
to TV screens, is expected to surge in the next few years. Industry
insiders see a world market for HDTV sets of around $100 billion by
1991.
   EEC companies are working on a European HDTV system in
competition with Japan, where NHK, the state-owned broadcaster, is
poised to launch HDTV after a series of demonstrations of the
technology earlier this year.
   The United States is also developing an HDTV standard that will
be incompatible with the Japanese standard and may be incompatible
with the European standard as well.
   The EEC firms _ Robert Bosch GMBH of West Germany, Philips
International BV of the Netherlands, Thomson SA of France and
Britain's Thorn EMI PLC _ might want to join the new European
company, the source said.

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade with the soybean market leading the way
on follow-through selling from last week's price break, analysts
said.
   Soybean prices also were pressured by a combination of bearish
technical and fundamental signals, including beneficial rain over
the weekend in the major soybean-growing region of Brazil.
   Rain in the winter wheat areas of the United States weighed on
soybean prices this morning.
   But corn was down only slightly in early trading with support
stemming from reports that the Soviet Union had told Argentinian
exporters that it intended to buy only U.S. corn to fill its corn
import needs for the remainder of this year.
   ``Corn is actually holding up better than anything else here and
that's probably the reason,'' said Jon Horton, grain market analyst

   Commodore International Ltd., the
resurgent maker of microcomputers, on Monday unveiled three new
models aimed at business users, including two additions to its Amiga
line intended to compete with Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh.
   The Amiga 2500 and the Amiga 2000HD are the first additions to
the line since two machines, one intended primarily for home use and
another for business, were unveiled in April 1987.
   The Amiga ranks fourth in U.S. sales among computers with 32-bit
microprocessors, behind the Macintosh, International Business
Machines Corp.'s Personal System-2 Model 70, and Compaq Computer
Corp.'s Deskpro 386, according to market researcher IMS America Ltd.
   ``Especially with Apple's introduction of the Mac II and IIX,
they needed to get the new Amigas out because Amiga was the hardware
leader three years ago,'' said Rhett Anderson, associate editor of
Compute Gazette, a magazine targeted at Commodore users and
published in Greensboro, N.C.
   ``Some of their thinking might be if they get these out before
Christmas, they (consumers) might hear the word Amiga and some might
take 500s (last year's low-cost home computer model) home,'' he said.
   The new Amigas offer twice the capacity of the earlier models and
a faster microprocessor.
   The 2000HD comes with software loaded on a hard disk so the
machine is ready to use right out of the box, said spokesman Gary
Fishman.
   The suggested retail price for the 2500 is $4,699 and the 200HD
is priced at $2,699. The suggested prices for the latest Macintosh
machines range from $100 to $3,000 more than the Amiga 2500.
   The company also introduced the PC40-III, which is Commodore's
first IBM AT-compatible machine sold in the United States, Fishman
said. Commodore already sells IBM-compatible computers in Europe.
   Earlier this month, Commodore reported a 52 percent increase in
earnings to $9.6 million for the first fiscal quarter of the year.
The company suffered serious losses in 1985 and 1986 before starting
to turn around last year.

<HEAD>Court Orders Restudy of Whether Florida can Tax OCS Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered a Florida court
to restudy whether that state may tax income derived from the sale
of oil extracted from the Outer Continental Shelf.
   The court sent a case involving Shell Oil Co. back to the Florida
Supreme Court for further study in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's
ruling on Nov. 8 in a case from Iowa.
   The justices ruled that Iowa may tax income derived from oil and
natural gas taken from the Outer Continental Shelf.
   The high court upheld an Iowa law that allows a state to impose a
tax on that portion of a company's income calculated to come from
the amount of business it does within that state.
   In the Florida case, that state's highest court ruled in 1986
that the Florida tax applies to offshore oil refined and sold by an
oil company within the 50 states _ after it has been transferred to
the mainland by pipeline from the offshore wells and platforms.
   The state court said only income from oil actually sold on the
platforms at sea is exempt from the Florida tax.
   The Outer Continental Shelf is underwater land more than three
miles off the shore of any state. The land is owned by the federal
government, which leases it to private companies.
   Shell said a 1953 federal law authorizing exploration and
production of Outer Continental Shelf oil bars states from taxing
any natural gas or oil derived from the offshore land regardless of
where the products are sold.
   ``Any form of state levy, direct or indirect, would adversely
affect the amounts of revenue available to the federal government''
from the offshore leases, Shell said.
   State taxes reduce the value of the federal leases, the company
said.
   It added that the Florida tax is ``precisely the result Congress
attempted to forbid'' in exempting the oil from state taxes.
   The Florida Department of Revenue imposed the tax on a portion of
Shell Oil's profits based on a complex formula designed to take into
account what percentage of the company's national business occurs in
Florida.
   The natural gas extracted by Shell was not affected by the case
because it is transferred to other companies that rent space on
Shell's offshore platforms _ and was not carried by pipeline to the
mainland before sale.
   The Supreme Court in 1981 struck down a Louisiana tax on natural
gas that passes through the state on its way to consumers in other
states. The court said the Louisiana tax interferes with interstate
commerce and with the authority vested in the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.
   The case is Shell Oil vs. Florida, 86-1593.

<TEXT>
   The federal government today ordered a broad
range of transportation workers from commercial pilots to truckers
to undergo random drug testing. But the testing need not begin for
at least a year.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley told a news conference the
regulations would cover about 4 million workers and were intended to
``take us as far as (is) practically possible'' toward ending drug
use among workers in jobs were safety is an issue.
   The Transportation Department said without offering specifics
that large companies and transit agencies would have until December
1989 to begin the testing. Smaller ones will have up to two years.
   Under the new rule, employers must keep records of testing
results and make them available to federal officials. It was not
clear how independent truckers would be expected to comply with that
provision.
   Unions representing transportation workers have strongly opposed
required random testing, although the unions have been willing to go
along with other tests such as those conducted prior to employment
or after accidents.
   The random testing requirement is virtually sure to be challenged
in the courts, but DOT officials have said they are confident of
having the tests upheld because of the safety implications.
   The testing regulations will cover an estimated 2.5 million
over-the-road truckers, including the tens of thousands of
independent truckers, many of whom work for themselves and drive
their own truck.
   Critics as well as some supporters of the testing regulations
have questioned whether the rules should even cover truck drivers
because the testing may be virtually impossible to enforce among the
independent drivers.
   According to government sources, who asked not to be named, other
workers subject to random tests include:
   _More than 500,000 airline workers, including 50,000 commercial
pilots, more than 80,000 flight attendants and nearly 300,000
aircraft mechanics.
   _Nearly 300,000 railroad employees, including engineers and other
train operators.
   _About 110,000 urban mass transit workers, including subway and
city bus drives.
   Under the regulations, workers would be subject to pre-employment
tests, periodic testing whenever a person takes a physical,
post-accident tests, tests for reasonable cause and random tests.
   The drug testing rule had been expected for months.
   Burnley's predecessor, Elizabeth Dole, called for increased
testing for drugs among workers in all modes of transportation in
early l987. The department has issued proposed regulations for the
various modes of transportation during the last year.
   Congress this year debated legislation that would have required
drug testing of millions of transportation workers, but the
provision never was approved, in part because of strong opposition
from organized labor. The department has maintained, however, that
it does not need new regulations to impose the testing requirements.
   Unions contend the random tests violate privacy and could make
workers vulnerable to losing their jobs because of erroneous
laboratory results.
   Drug testing of transportation workers gained widespread interest
nearly two years ago after the drug-related Jan. 4, 1987, collision
of a Conrail locomotive and an Amtrak passenger train in Chase, Md.,
in which 16 people were killed and 175 others were injured.
   Two crewmen on the Conrail engine later admitted they had smoked
marijuana shortly before the crash.

<HEAD>Control Data Expects Fourth-Quarter Earnings Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp., turning more
pessimistic, said Monday it expects to record a loss in the fourth
quarter that will leave it with approximately break-even results for
the year as a whole.
   The change in outlook is mainly attributable to continued delays
in shipments in the company's computer products division, Control
Data said. This includes start-up production delays for the new
Control Data Cyber 960 mid-range mainframe, which earlier
experienced delays in availability of critical logic chips.
   ``The outlook for the year, particularly in the computer products
division, has changed in the last few days,'' said Robert M. Price,
chairman and chief executive officer, in a written statement. ``...
The bulk of the change is due to timing as opposed to lost
business.''
   Last month, Control Data reported a net loss of $2.4 million on
revenues of $841.4 million for the third quarter ending Sept. 30.
For the first nine months of the year, the company had net earnings
of $14.5 million on revenues of $2.7 billion.

<HEAD>Pillsbury's British Prowler May Be Takeover Target Itself</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, seeking Pillsbury Co. in
a $5.23 billion hostile takeover, said Monday that a group of
investors including Pillsbury may be planning a Pac-Man countermove
on the British conglomerate.
   Walter Montgomery, a spokesman for Grand Metropolitan, confirmed
the accuracy of remarks about the rumored move, which were made by
the company's chief executive officer, Ian A. Martin, in an
interview.
   Martin told the Wall Street Journal he was taking seriously
rumors that a group of other unidentified investors were seeking
buyers for all or parts of Grand Metropolitan, a large London-based
distilling, gambling and franchise concern.
   He also said one of the potential participants might be
Pillsbury, the big Minneapolis-based food and restaurant franchise
targeted for acquisition by Grand Metropolitan last month. At the
same time, Martin expressed some doubt that Pillsbury would
undertake a Pac-Man defense.
   The Pac-Man strategy is so named because it resembles the popular
video game in which a target turns and tries to gobble up its
pursuer.
   Pillsbury spokesman John Thompson said he had no comment on
Martin's remarks.
   Part of the reason Grand Metropolitan might be considered an
attractive takeover target was the difference between its stock
price of about $8 a share and its estimated breakup value of between
$12.50 and $18 a share.
   That degree of discrepancy often invites takeover bids by
investors who hope to profit by selling pieces of a target company.
   ``When there's a gap as big as there is between our share price
and (breakup value) you have to take it seriously just as a
technical matter,'' Martin told the Journal.
   Martin said he saw little logic in a Pillsbury move on his
company, so ``the only conclusion I can come to is that (if the
rumors are true) they're trying to frighten us to abandon our bid,
or something of that kind.''
   Nevertheless, he said, ``we have to take it seriously. We're in a
major bid battle here. We don't know the source of the rumors or how
serious they were.''
   On Oct. 4 Grand Metropolitan undertook one of the biggest hostile
takeover attempts on a company with a $60-a-share tender offer for
Pillsbury, which has been fighting the bid. Last week Pillsbury
announced a restructuring that includes spinning off its Burger King
Corp. subsidiary as an independent company.
   Pillsbury and Grand Metropolitan also have been skirmishing in
court over the validity of Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
bylaw, which thus far has prevented Grand Metropolitan from
accepting any tendered shares. The bylaw would make an acquisition
prohibitively expensive.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs plunged by
45 this week to total 897, marking the largest single-week decline
since February, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The sharp drop continues a seesaw trend in the volatile energy
industry, but contradicts a traditional year-end increase, said
Baker Hughes spokesman Ike Kerridge.
   ``The count has been moving up and down, but it's been within a
narrow range for several months,'' Kerridge said. ``We don't have
any explanation for this, except to say that it's probably the
result of of uncertain crude prices.''
   The number of rigs last week increased by 19 to total 942,
following a decline of 10 working rigs in the previous week.
   A year ago the count was 1,174, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
The 897 reported Monday is the lowest count since Aug. 1, when there
were 894 working rigs.
   It also marked the single largest decline since Feb. 1, when the
count dropped by 62 rigs to total 964.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas posted the biggest drop
with 20 fewer rigs, followed by Wyoming, five; Colorado, New Mexico
and Ohio, four each; California and North Dakota, three each; and
Kansas, one.
   States that saw increases include Oklahoma, three; Pennsylvania,
two; and Michigan, one. Louisiana's count was unchanged for the week.

<HEAD>Reagan Honors Firms for Quality Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Monday recognized the
winners of a new national business award for quality control, saying
their accomplishments helped America become more competitive in
world markets.
   The first annual Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards were
presented to Motorola Inc. and Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
commercial nuclear fuel division in the manufacturing category, and
to Globe Metallurgical Inc. of Beverly, Ohio, in the small company
category.
   The awards were created by Congress last year in honor of
Baldrige, who was killed in a rodeo accident in California in July
1987 while serving as secretary of commerce.
   Supporters hope honoring U.S. companies for their quality-control
efforts will boost the standing of U.S. products on overseas
markets. The Baldrige prize is modeled after the Deming Prize, which
Japan has been awarding since 1951 to recognize quality achievements
by Japanese companies.
   W. Edwards Deming is an American quality control expert revered
in Japan for his work with Japanese companies after World War II.
   ``Today's ceremony reflects both the progress we have made and
the promises that we have yet to keep,'' Reagan said. ``America's
economic strength depends on industry's ability to improve its
productivity and quality.''
   C. William Verity, who succeeded Baldrige as commerce secretary,
said that the awards were a direct answer to critics who ``still
think it is fashionable to question the quality of products that are
marked Made in America. ... Based on the strength of the
applications received this year, I think it is clear that the
winners' accomplishments are just the tip of the iceberg in a
back-to-quality movement in this country.''
   Commerce Department officials said that 66 U.S. companies entered
the competition for the first awards. The legislation allows up to
two awards to be presented in the three categories: manufacturing,
services and small companies with fewer than 500 employees.
   However, the judges decided not to make any awards in services
this year and only one award in the small business category.
   Accepting the awards were Robert W. Galvin, chairman of the board
of Motorola; John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer of
Westinghouse, and Arden C. Sims, president of Globe Metallurgical.
   Sims said that Globe, which produces specialty metal alloys at
plants in Beverly, Ohio, and Selma, Ala., ``refused to accept the
gloom spreading over America's smokestack industries. ... We aimed
at becoming the lowest-cost, highest quality producer in the world.
We hit that mark.''
   Motorola's Galvin said that his company, which employs 99,000
workers at 53 plants worldwide, launched a drive to improve the
quality of its electronic products in 1981 and is well on the way to
achieving its 10-year goal of ``zero defects in everything that we
do.''
   Westinghouse employs 2,000 people in its nuclear fuels unit at
plants near Pittsburgh, where the metal tubes are manufactured, and
two facilities near Columbia, S.C., where the uranium fuel pellets
are loaded into the metal rods.
   Westinghouse supplies about 40 percent of the U.S. market for the
nuclear fuel rods used at nuclear plants generating electricity in
the United States and has 20 percent of the world market.
   Marous said his company's nuclear business was part of a
``goldfish bowl industry'' because of public concerns over the
safety of nuclear power. He said he hoped the award would ``reflect
credit on the entire industry, which is so important to the economic
well-being of the nation.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose in European trading Monday for
the first time since the U.S. presidential election amid signs of
strong official support for the currency.
   Gold prices turned mixed.
   The dollar began its recovery in Tokyo following Bank of Japan
intervention and on bullish comments from Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa and Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita. Both men
said Japanese authorities were ready to strengthen their
intervention efforts if the need arose.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve intervened later in the European trading
day buying small amounts of dollars for yen, dealers said.
   They said the dollar was given a further boost in Europe
following comments by President-elect George Bush that he will
continue the Reagan administration policy of working to stabilize
currency rates.
   Bush's remarks were echoed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady in an interview in Monday's Wall Street Journal.
   But dealers said that despite signs of strong official support
for the dollar, market sentiment remained bearish.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.70 yen to a closing 123.00 yen from Friday's
123.70. Later, in London, it was quoted at 123.40 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.8090 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8137 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.7452 West German marks, up from 1.7345; 1.4645 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4553; 5.9615 French francs, up from 5.9285; 1.9735 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.9551; 1,303.50 Italian lire, up from 1,296.50;
and 1,2297 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $420.95 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $419.95.
   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid $420.00 an ounce,
compared with $420.20 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 32 cents to close at a bid
$422.51 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market to a late bid
price of $6.39 a troy ounce, compared with Friday's $6.45 dollars.

<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. reported Monday its third-quarter
earnings rose 14.6 percent as the retailer's sales increased 6.4
percent.
   K mart reported income of $126.1 million, or 63 cents a share,
for the 13 weeks ended Oct. 28, up from $110.1 million, or 54 cents
a share, in the same period in 1987.
   The company said sales for the period rose to $6.36 billion from
$5.97 billion in the third quarter of last year.
   On a comparable store basis _ based on stores open in the third
quarter both this year and last _ sales were up 2.4 percent, K mart
said.
   Joseph E. Antonini, K mart chairman and chief executive officer,
said sales rose at a faster rate in the third quarter than the first
or second.
   ``This suggests that customers are responding to our lowering of
shelf prices, our strengthened once-a-week advertising program and
to our various merchandising programs,'' Antonini said.
   Antonini said 1,113 K mart stores were linked with the company's
point-of-sale computerized central inventory control system, up from
729 a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, K mart said it had
income of $409.7 million, or $2.04 a share, on sales of $18.88
billion, up from $371 million, or $1.82 a share, on sales of $17.87
billion in the nine months ended Oct. 26, 1987.
   The company had 2,243 K mart discount stores, 1,213 Waldenbooks,
133 Builders Square and 257 Pay Less Drug stores as of Oct. 26.

   Grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade after recovering from an early
sell-off on rumors that the Soviet Union had bought up to 2 million
metric tons of U.S. corn.
   The soybean market led the morning decline right from the opening
bell on follow-through selling from last week's losses.
   But the corn market held up well in early trading and ultimately
led the other markets higher. The rumors of Soviet buying followed a
morning news report that the Soviet Union had told Argentinian
exporters it planned to import only U.S. corn for the remainder of
1988.
   ``Around mid-session, we finally bottomed out and started to
recover,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Cargill Inc., a major grain dealer, spurred the price recovery by
buying about 12 million bushels of corn in the afternoon session,
analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents lower to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.20} a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.71} a bushel; oats were

<TEXT>
   British Coal, the state-owned mining company due to
be privatized in the early 1990s, on Monday reported a pre-tax loss
of 56 million pounds, or $101 million, for the first six months of
its fiscal year.
   The loss was narower than its pre-tax loss of 136 million pounds
in the same period a year ago.
   Operating profit, before interest charges and other items, in the
six months ended Sept. 30 spurted 83 percent to 190 million pounds,
or $342 million, from 104 million pounds last year.
   The company said it was its highest operating profit since 1969.
   Total coal production rose to 48.8 million tons from 47.6 million
tons for the same six months a year ago.
   British Coal Chairman Robert Haslam said further pit closures
this year would lead to the loss of 8,000 jobs from the current
total of 114,000. He warned the National Union of Mineworkers that
strike action against the closure plans could mean an additional
12,000 job losses next year.
   Since the 1984-1985 miners' strike over mine closures, British
Coal's workforce has declined to 114,000 from 221,000.

<HEAD>Matsushita To Sell Tandy-Made PCs Under Panasonic Label</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulling a switch, Tandy Corp. will sell its
American-made personal computers to Japan's Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. Ltd. for sale under the Panasonic brand name, it was
announced Monday.
   The deal, a marketing success for Tandy, marks the first time a
Japanese company has bought personal computers made in the United
States for sale in the United States.
   Tandy used to sell its computers only through company-owned
stores, but has been moving aggressively to find other outlets for
its broad line of industry-standard machines.
   The Fort Worth, Texas-based company announced last month it would
sell PCs to Digital Equipment Corp. for sale under the Digital
label. In June, it said it would sell PCs through Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.
   ``This agreement is an important step in our announced strategy
to leverage Tandy's computer design and world-class manufacturing
capability by distributing through alternative marketing channels,''
John Patterson, senior vice president of Tandy Computers, said in a
written statement.
   Matsushita, whose brand names include Panasonic, Quasar, Technics
and National, has $4.5 billion in annual sales in the United States,
making it the leading consumer electronics company in U.S. sales.
   Although Matsushita sells personal computers in Japan, they
cannot run the same software as American computers, Panasonic
spokesman James Wickizer said. He said sales of the Tandy-made
machines would begin in the first quarter of 1989.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev summoned top
Communist Party and government officials to a provincial town Monday
and told them his reforms will fail unless consumers get better food
supplies.
   His decision to gather top Kremlin leaders, officials of the
state-run media as well as regional and district party chiefs in
Orel indicated the importance of the topic as well as the success
the area has had improving its farm output.
   Such meetings rarely are held outside the Kremlin.
   The evening TV news program ``Vremya'' devoted its first 80
minutes to the meeting, showing Gorbachev's remarks and those of a
parade of Orel officials and farmers who said they had increased the
output of milk and other foodstuffs because of agricultural reforms
introduced under Gorbachev, Communist Party chief since March 1985.
   ``We don't need just words on this theme, there have been a lot
of words spoken already _ including during the years of
perestroika,'' Gorbachev said in remarks carried by the Tass news
agency. ``Now it is clear to us that we cannot move forward
successfully, not having decided this problem.''
   Official Radio Moscow said Gorbachev called the Soviet Union's
food supply problems ``the most important problem of the internal
policy of the Soviet Union.'' He has said many times that improving
food supplies and consumer goods is the top priority of his reform
effort.
   The collectivized farm sector is plagued by low productivity,
disregard for the land and machinery, waste in shipping and storage,
and few cultural and social amenities in the countryside.
   Soviet food stores frequently are empty of anything but the most
basic goods.
   At the meeting in the Communist Party Central Committee last
month, Gorbachev said agrarian policy had turned farmers ``from
masters of their land into day laborers.''
   Gorbachev announced plans then to push his lease-contract
program, under which large collective and state farms turn over land
to families and other small groups on long-term leases, into the
whole farm sector.
   Officials say such a system instills in farmers greater care for
the land and makes them several times more efficient than other
farmers.
   Gorbachev billed the meeting in Orel, an industrial city about
230 miles south of Moscow, as a run-up to a meeting in the Communist
Party's policy-making Central Committee in February to discuss farm
policy.
   He frequently goes on trips outside of Moscow to push his reform
effort, but it was rare for him to call a large gathering of top
national and regional officials outside of the Kremlin.
   Farms in the region produce grain, vegetables and dairy products,
and raise beef cattle.
   Gorbachev, who was responsible for Soviet farm policy before
becoming party general secretary in 1985, said improvements in the
Orel region's agricultural production in the past three years prove
the value of his drive for greater local control, Tass said.
   The improvements indicate ``much depends on the initiative, and
independence of local organs of power to rule and decide practical
problems of the agricultural sector,'' Tass said.
   The lead article of the government newspaper Izvestia Monday
evening said the Orel region had increased its sales of meat by a
third and milk by 17 percent in the past three years. It ran its
story under a headline ``Lease Contracts Return the Land to its
Master.''
   Among the Kremlin officials who attended the gathering were
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, formerly regarded as the No. 2
leader but shifted at the end of September to the agriculture
portfolio. Ligachev did not attend a mid-October meeting in the
Central Committee on agriculture.
   Other Politburo members who attended were Vitaly Vorotnikov,
president of the Russian republic, Moscow party chief Lev Zaikov,
and former agricultural party chief Viktor Nikonov.

   The stock market drifted lower Monday, extending
its post-election slump through a fourth consecutive session.
   Trading remained quiet.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.95 to 2,065.08,
bringing its loss over the four trading days since the election last
Tuesday to 62.41 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
561 up, 912 down and 486 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.90 million
shares, against 135.50 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 166.99 million shares.
   Stock prices followed the dollar lower in last week's trading
amid uncertainty about the likely course of the U.S. currency in the
administration of President-elect Bush.
   The dollar recovered some of its losses in Monday's activity.
Nicholas Brady, secretary of the Treasury, said U.S. policy remains
committed to ``exchange market stability'' for currencies.
   However, brokers said few market participants were eagerly
bidding for stocks in advance of the government's monthly report,
scheduled to be issued Wednesday, on the nation's trade balance for
September.
   Petrie Stores took the day's biggest percentage drop among NYSE
issues, tumbling 3{ to 15{. Chairman Milton Petrie, who had said he
was considering an offer to buy the company's shares he doesn't
already known, announced that he had decided to drop the idea.
   Control Data fell 1{ to 17}. The company said it may report a
loss for the fourth quarter that could bring its results for the
year down to the break-even point.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose [ to 42~ and
International Business Machines gained { to 117[, while American
Telephone & Telegraph was down \ at 27~ and Merck dropped | to 55].
   TW Services fell } to 23|. A member of the investment group
Coniston Partners was determined to pursue its bid for a big chunk
of TW's stock, despite a New York Times article citing obstacles to
its potential success.
   Alco Health Services jumped 3[ to 28{ in the over-the-counter
market. The company said it agreed to be acquired for $31 a share by
a group of investors that includes members of its management.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $4.82 billion, or 0.18
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped
.20 to 151.04.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell .38 to 307.73, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was down .20 at 267.72.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.40 to 372.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 289.40, down 2.08.

   Comdex, the annual barometer of the economic
health of the computer industry, opened Monday with the promoter of
the event pronouncing the patient in good condition.
   More than 100,000 people are expected to attend this year's show,
which runs through Friday. Demands for exhibit space are up 14
percent over a year ago.
   ``Obviously, the computer industry is alive and well,'' said
Sheldon Adelson, chairman of the Interface Group, the producer of
the five-day event.
   More than 1,700 companies are exhibiting their computer wares at
this year's show, with displays covering 1.75 million square feet in
eight locations.
   The week's activities range from parties introducing new products
to seminars on a host of topics, from industry trends to battling
computer viruses
   Adelson, in an interview Sunday, said he expected this 10th
anniversary show to break all records in terms of attendance,
display space, foreign companies exhibiting their wares and media in
attendance.
   The booming attendance is a good sign for the computer industry,
Adelson said.
   ``Comdex reflects the health of the computer industry,'' Adelson
said. ``How the show goes, so goes the industry, and vice versa. The
turnout at this year's show demonstrates that the industry is alive
and well.''
   Adelson said personal computers (PCs) and laptop computers are
expected to be the big drawing card again this year.
   Comdex Fall in Las Vegas and a companion show in Atlanta in the
spring are used by companies around the globe to introduce new lines
of hardware and software.
   The 1988 show reflects the marked growth of Comdex and the
computer industry from a decade ago, when 4,000 attendees crowded
into a ballroom at a Strip resort to view products from 157
exhibitors.
   Twenty members of the media covered that first show. Some 2,000
are expected for the 1988 version.
   Keynote speakers at Monday's opening event included: Rod Canion,
president of Compaq Computer Corp.; William Gates, co-founder and
chairman of Microsoft Corp.; Philippe Kahn, president of Borland
International; Robert Kavner, president, AT&T Data Systems Group;
and Terry Lautenbach, senior vice president of International
Business Machines Corp.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Plummet On International Discord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices plummeted Monday as reports of discord at
the London meeting of the International Coffee Organization reached
traders on the floor of Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New York.
   On other exchanges, copper, gold, silver, oil and pork futures
rose; cattle, grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   A week-long meeting of the 74 nation-members of the International
Coffee Organization opened on a sour note with the producer
countries divided on their goals and the United States, the largest
of the consumer members, threatening to withdraw from the ICO unless
it becomes more responsive to the marketplace.
   U.S. representative Allan Wallis, the under-secretary of state
for economic affairs, said U.S. participation in the next
International Coffee Agreeement was ``in jeopardy'' due to the
problems of the two-tier coffee market and the tight availability of
the mild arabica coffee beans favored by American coffee drinkers.
   A two-tier market has been created by the willingness of coffee
producers to sell coffee beans at a discount to countries that are
not ICO members, said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Although the European Economic Community and other Northern
Hemisphere nations belong to the ICO, the United States' absence
from a new agreement ``would likely be seen as a death blow to the
agreement's effectiveness,'' Stevenson said.
   That prospect prompted heavy selling of coffee futures in New
York. Coffee settled .89 cent to 1.52 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in December at $1.2727 a pound.
   The London meeting is the second to be held this year to conduct
preliminary negotiations toward a new coffee agreement. The current
pact expires next Sept. 30.
   Despite his complaints, Wallis expressed confidence that the
negotiations could produce a satisfactory compromise. And Stevenson
noted that bargaining was at an early stage.
   ``We cannot realistically expect the boys in London to wrap up
everything this week,'' he said.
   Copper futures prices advanced slightly on New York's Commodity
Exchange after both the Comex and the London Metal Exchange reported
drawdowns last week in their warehouse stocks of the metal.
   Copper prices declined last week after touching a new record high
of $1.538 for spot delivery. But Fred Demler, metals economist with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York, said the market appeared to
be consolidating before moving higher.
   ``There's a lot of nervousness in the market right now,'' he
said. ``The technicals (chart signals) suggest maybe the correction
isn't over.''
   Copper settled .20 cent lower to 1.80 cents higher with the spot
November contract at $1.43 a pound and December at $1.36 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures advanced on the Comex mainly in response
to a gain in energy prices, Demler said.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $2.30 higher with December at $425.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.7 cents to 3 cents higher with December at
$6.445 a troy ounce.
   Fears of tight gasoline supplies supported energy futures prices
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, although trading volume was
light.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 32 cents
higher with December at $14.27 a barrel; heating oil was .34 cent to
.62 cent higher with December at 44.63 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .61 cent to 1.51 cents higher with December at 48.16
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures ended mixed to lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after a late selling flurry erased earlier gains. Analysts
linked the selling to light movement of boxed beef at lower prices
and concern that the live cattle market had also slowed.
   Pork futures gained slightly due to higher cash prices following
light weekend marketings.
   Live cattle settled .33 cent lower to .03 cent higher with
December at 72.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower
to .25 cent higher with November at 81.60 cents a pound; live hogs
were unchanged to .32 cent higher with December at 40.67 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .57 cent higher with
February at 44.77 cents a pound.
   Corn futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade on rumors
that the Soviet Union had bought up to 2 million metric tons of U.S.
corn. Wheat and soybeans finished narrowly mixed after recovering
from an early sell-off.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$4.20} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with December
at $2.71{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1} cents higher with
December at $2.13} a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to } cent
higher with November at $7.59 a bushel.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Merc, where
the contract for December delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
settled .25 point higher at 268.85.

   Coca-Cola, IBM and Sony are the three most
powerful brand names in the world, according to a new survey
published Monday.
   The Landor Imagepower Survey identified the 40 corporate or
consumer brand names which register most strongly with consumers in
the United States, Japan and Western Europe. Of the 40 top brands,
17 belong to U.S. companies, 14 to European firms and nine to the
Japanese, the study found.
   The study was conducted by Landor Associates, an image management
and strategic design consultant. The firm interviewed 3,000
consumers in the three geographic markets to test 2,140 brand names.
   ``The winners in this survey are the first true world brands,''
said John M. Diefenbach, Landor's chief executive officer. ``The
obvious lesson for business is that, as the marketplace becomes
increasingly global, products with the strongest brand images have
the opportunity to gain the largest market share.''
   After Coca-Cola, IBM and Sony, the study found the 25 most
powerful brands were (in descending order): Porsche, McDonald's,
Disney, Honda, Toyota, Seiko, BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes, Pepsi Cola,
Kleenex, Nestle, Rolex, Jaguar, Xerox, Lipton, Hilton, Polaroid,
Canon, Levi's, Yamaha and Nissan.

   Allegheny International Inc. said Monday it
signed a definitive agreement to sell its Thermco Systems Inc.
subsidiary, a maker of equipment used in producing semiconductors.
   The terms of the sale were withheld.
   The deal with Silicon Valley Group Inc. is subject to approval by
federal bankruptcy court, where Allegheny International, primarily a
producer of consumer products, has been reorganizing since early
this year. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti likely will ask the
opinion of Allegheny International's creditors.
   ``We have no reason to believe they would oppose it,'' said
Anthony Muller, vice president and chief financial officer of SVG of
San Jose, Calif.
   Thermco, based in Orange, Calif., employs about 390 people making
and marketing equipment used to deposit the various layers of
semiconductor wafers. Thermco is slightly larger than SVG, which
recently reported it earned $4.4 million on sales of $49 million for
the year ended Sept. 30.
   SVG, which employs about 450 people, produces equipment used to
prepare the semiconductor wafers before the circuits are etched in
them, Muller said.
   SVG plans no changes in Thermco's operations or employment if the
deal goes through, he said.

<HEAD>Union Plan To Sue Hafts Over Potential Lost Wages And Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Food and Commercial Workers Union
said Monday it plans to sue Dart Group Corp. for an unsuccessful
takeover attempt that the union claims may put over 9,000 Bradlees
employees out of work.
   Carey Butsavage, an attorney for the UFCW, said the union will
seek to make Dart Group, based in Landover, Md., reimburse employees
for any lost wages they would have earned under their current union
contracts.
   The UCFW also wants Dart to pay the costs of employees' medical
insurance and retraining.
   Bradlees is a discount store chain owned by Boston-based Stop &
Shop Cos. Inc., the target of an unsuccessful buyout attempt by the
Hafts earlier this year. Stop & Shop decided to sell many of its
Bradlees stores to help pay the debt it incurred in a $1.23 billion
leveraged buyout undertaken to thwart Dart.
   ``A leveraged buyout blocked the Haft takeover but they walked
away with their customary fat profit _ this time, $17 million,''
said Tom McNutt, president of Local 400 of the UCFW. ``Bradlees
employees had their jobs sold out from under them to pay the costs
of the Haft raid.''
   Dart Group, controlled by Herbert Haft and his son Robert, has
been involved in a number of unsuccessful takeovers.
   Robert Haft, Dart Group president, on Monday defended his
companies' actions in a press release saying, ``The claims are
without merit and appear to be a publicity stunt.''
   The civil suit was to be filed in Camden, N.J., the union said.
Court papers were made available to reporters Monday, but court
officials in New Jersey could not immediately say whether the suit
actually had been filed.
   Although Dart controls retail operations of its own, such as
Crown Books, the Hafts have earned a reputation as corporate raiders
by launching bids for several major retailing chains such as
Supermarkets General, Safeway Stores and Eckerd Corp.
   None of the raids have been successful, but in most of them Dart
reportedly has profited by selling its stock to the target company
or a rival bidder.
   Dart launched its bid for Stop & Shop in January. Following a
similar pattern, Stop & Shop's stock price soared as management
fought to remain independent and speculators anticipated a bidding
war.
   Stop & Shop finally agreed to a leveraged buyout arranged by New
York-based Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. In such deals, a company is
acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with the
company's cash flow or money raised by the sale of its assets.
   The deal allowed Stop & Shop to remain independent, but to pay
the enormous debt it had to sell part of its underperforming
Bradlees division. Hechinger Co. bought the leases to 47 local
Bradlees stores.
   In May, Stop & Shop said it would sell all of the 58 Bradlees
stores in its Southern divison, including southern New Jersey,
Maryland and Virginia, approximately one-third of the Bradlees it
owns. The company decided not to sell its 113 Stop & Shop stores.

<HEAD>Interco Says It Will Continue Appealing Poison Pill Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc. indicated Monday it would continue
resisting a $2.7 billion hostile takeover bid, and would go ahead
with a planned restructuring if its suitor follows through on its
threat to withdraw the offer.
   The furniture and apparel maker also said it intended to pursue
its appeal of a Delaware court ruling striking down its ``poison
pill'' defense against the $74 a share tender offer.
   Interco closed down $2.12{ a share at $65.87{ in New York Stock
Exchange trading on Monday.
   Interco made its disclosures in a letter to Cardinal Acquisition
Corp., led by Steven and Mitchell Rales of Washington, D.C.
   They came the day after Cardinal released a letter to Interco
extending its hostile offer by two days, to midnight EST Wednesday,
and threatening to withdraw the offer if company did not agree by 5
p.m. EST Wednesday to give it confidential corporate information or
enter into buyout talks.
   Interco fashioned the restructuring as a defensive maneuver to
help it thwart the Raleses, who it has rebuffed since their initial
$64 a share buyout offer in July.
   The $2.8 billion plan includes payment of a special dividend
totaling $30.80 in cash and securities, plus the possible sale of
its Ethan Allan furniture business and other operations.
   The Raleses have insisted on a chance to bid on any assets
Interco might put up for sale. In a letter to Steven Rales released
Monday, Interco Chairman Harvey Saligman indicated that if the
Raleses did decide to withdraw their tender offer they would be
invited to bid on any properties Interco decided to sell.
   Cardinal announced last Wednesday that Interco stockholders had
tendered 29.6 million shares under its offer. Combined with the 3.2
million shares the group already owns, that would give the Raleses
control of 92 percent of Interco's outstanding shares.
   In its letter, the group contended the only barrier to completion
of a buyout was Interco's refusal to withdraw its takeover defense.
   Last week, the Delaware Chancery Court enjoined the use of the
poison pill defense, but Interco has appealed the decision to the
Delaware Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the appeal on Nov. 30.
Interco is incorporated in Delaware.
   ``...while you profess to have confidence in your position on
appeal, your letter boils down to an attempt to pressure us into
abandoning it,'' Saligman's letter read. ``We decline to do so.''
   Interco employs about 54,000 people nationwide and had sales of
$3.34 billion last year. In addition to Ethan Allen, the company
controls such clothing, furniture and shoe brands as London Fog,
Converse and Florsheim.

   Honeywell Bull on Monday unveiled a
powerful mainframe computer capable of performing more than 1,000
transactions per second, which the company said made it about twice
as fast as its closest competitor.
   ``The operating speed, performance and reliability of the DPS
9000 computer establishes a new industry standard,'' Rolad D.
Pampel, Honeywell Bull president and chief executive officer, said
in a prepared announcement.
   ``The DPS 9000 system is a powerful tool for high-volume
transaction processing, relational database management and complex
networking. It also features a high-speed, integrated vector
processor for numerically intensive computing,'' the announcement
read.
   Groupe Bull of France, NEC of Japan and Honeywell, the three
shareholders in Honeywell Bull, cooperated in researching and
developing the new computer.
   The basic mainframe hardware was developed by NEC and Honeywell
Bull. Honeywell Bull developed the high performance transaction
processing software and Groupe Bull developed the networking
software.

<HEAD>Oil Industry Wants National Energy Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States could face another energy
crisis if the domestic oil industry fails to gain congressional
support for a national policy, an oilpatch lawmaker told oil company
executives Monday.
   A national oil policy is needed to boost domestic production,
which has plunged in recent months along with crude prices, leaving
the United States dependent on foreign sources for nearly half of
its oil, speakers told the annual meeting of the American Petroleum
Institute.
   ``I think we're drifting toward a serious energy crisis,'' said
Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La.
   Breaux warned that by allowing the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to flood world markets with oil and, in effect,
to dictate oil policy, ``...I fear there won't be anybody left (in
the United States) to produce.''
   Breaux and other speakers called on industry leaders to urge the
new administration and Congress to support tax incentives to help
neutralize current volatile oil prices.
   Earlier, Amoco Corp. Chairman Richard M. Morrow told reporters at
a news conference that U.S. oil production had fallen by 1 million
barrels a day due to declining oil prices, while demand had
increased by the same amount.
   Morrow, who also is chairman of the API, predicted that if the
current trend continues the United States could be importing
two-thirds of its oil by the year 2000, a situation which has
``serious ramifications'' for the United States. Foreign imports
have soared to about 42 percent.
   But while President-elect George Bush has said he would support
incentives to strengthen U.S. production, U.S. Rep. Richard B.
Cheney, R-Wyo., said winning the support of Congress would not be
easy.
   ``Getting an energy policy is going to be tough. ... I would like
to tell you that things are different but they aren't,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney said consumers as well as many in government are
insensitive to the industry's problems because they ``like cheap gas
and oil.''
   ``Many in Congress are saying...`you guys did well when oil was
$30 a barrel,''' he said.
   Most economists and analysts attending the API meeting said they
were not optimistic that OPEC would reach an accord any time soon on
limiting production to help boost prices.
   The 13-nation cartel meets Nov. 21 in Vienna to discuss possible
ways of boosting prices.
   Morrow also said that he believed more and more U.S. oil
companies would move production overseas in the future, in the
absence of incentives and in an effort to avoid costly environmental
regulations.
   He said Amoco spends 35 to 40 percent of its production budget on
international exploration and will boost that to 50 percent in the
near future.

<HEAD>Sanofi Asks For $27 Million Fees And Expenses From Robins Merger
Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European pharmaceutical company Sanofi
SA asked a federal judge on Monday to order A.H. Robins Co. to pay
it $27.1 million for fees and expenses from its unsuccessful attempt
to obtain a controlling interest in Robins.
   In the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Paris-based Sanofi is
seeking a $25 million fee and $2.1 million for its expenses.
   Sanofi's requested breakup fee is the same as U.S. District Judge
Robert R. Merhige Jr. awarded Rorer Group Inc., another unsuccessful
suitor.
   Robins and Rorer had signed a breakup fee agreement that was
approved as part of Robins' Chapter 11 reorganization case, but the
court did not approve a similar proposal involving Sanofi.
   Sanofi said in Monday's filing that it should receive the money
even though it had no court-approved agreement.
   The company claimed there was at least an implied agreement
between it and Robins because their teams of executives, lawyers,
investment bankers, accountants and other advisers worked nearly
around the clock to negotiate agreements and prepare documents by
court deadlines.
   John D. Taylor, a Robins senior vice president, said company
officials could not comment on Sanofi's filing because they had not
seen it.
   The court has approved a plan under which American Home Products
Corp. would acquire Robins, but eight appeals have been filed.
Arguments before a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel are
scheduled for Dec. 6.
