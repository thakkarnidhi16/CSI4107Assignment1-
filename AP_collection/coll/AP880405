   Tens of thousands of Afghans went to
the polls Tuesday on the first day of general elections that will
be held over 10 days, Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul reported.
   They are the first general elections in Afghanistan since
pro-Soviet military officers seized power ten years ago.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said President Najib and
other Communist Party officials cast their ballots in the elections
for the Senate and National Assembly.
   In its first reports, Radio Kabul said voters participated with
``enthusiasm and happiness'' and Tuesday's balloting ended in an
orderly manner.
   But in later broadcasts monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp, the government station in Kabul, the Afghan capital, said
rebels fired at some polling stations in four provinces and other
areas.
   The night broadcast said ``in some provinces the elections are
taking place in difficult conditions.'' It did not say if there
were any casualties.
   It reported that 147,300 people out of the 955,000 registered
voters cast their ballots Tuesday. The broadcast also said there
were as many as eight candidates for some legislative seats, and 70
per cent of the candidates were independents.
   One fourth of the 62 seats in the Senate and 229 in the National
Assembly are set aside for representatives of anti-communist rebel
groups, even if they do not participate.
   In a message to the United Nations, Najib said the elections
were ``universal, secret, direct and democratic.''
   ``The Republic of Afghanistan invites a delegation of the Human
Rights Commission of the United Nations to visit the Republic of
Afghanistan in order to see the process of elections,'' his message
said.
   In a separate message to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, Najib said Afghans and Afghan political forces inside and
outside the country were welcome to participate in the elections.
   About 5 million Afghans have fled the war and live in refugee
camps in neighboring Pakistan and Iran, where rebel groups also
have headquarters.
   Najib said if the return of the refugees is delayed, ``We are
also ready to keep a necessary number of seats in both houses of
the National Assembly until their final return.''
   The elections are being held while U.N.-sponsored peace talks
are under way in Switzerland. The key issue in those negotiations
is the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet military personnel
from Afghanistan.
   Marxist military officers seized power in an April 1978 coup and
Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to help the government
battle the anti-communist guerrillas.
   In Geneva, negotiators representing Afghanistan, Pakistan, the
United States and Soviet Union completed five weeks of talks on an
Afghan peace settlement.
   ``There is a constructive atmosphere. I am hopeful that we can
in fact succeed shortly,'' said Robert Peck, a U.S. diplomat who
consults regularly with U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez.
   A diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Pakistan's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shahid Amin, held talks
with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov in Moscow.
Vorontsov's portfolio includes the Afghan conflict.
   The Soviets have announced they plan to withdraw their troops
from Afghanistan. The United States wants the Soviets to either cut
off aid to the Afghan government or allow Washington to continue
supporting the insurgents.

   Arab hijackers Tuesday forced a Kuwait
Airways jumbo jet to land in northeastern Iran, threatened to blow
it up and demanded that Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranian prisoners.
They later released 25 of the 112 people on board.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said without
elaboration that the 24 women were released early Wednesday after
negotiations with Iran's deputy prime minister, Ali Reza Moayyeri.
A man in poor health was freed Tuesday.
   Among the other passengers were three members of Kuwait's royal
family and a passenger with a U.S. passport, on a flight from
Bangkok to Kuwait. The gunmen warned the Kuwaiti royals would be
``in imminent danger'' if Kuwait refused to free the prisoners,
IRNA reported.
   The hijackers, brandishing pistols and hand grenades, identified
themselves only as Arabs. But their demands echoed those of
Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems holding American hostages in Lebanon.
   The Kuwaiti government rejected the hijackers' demand to release
17 prisoners, calling it ``blackmail,'' but said it would listen to
other demands, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
   IRNA said the 24 freed women included five stewardesses, and
identified them as 10 Britons, three Thais, three Egyptians, a
Philippine citizen, a Palestinian, a Singaporean, an Irishwoman, a
German, an Austrian, a Syrian and a Pakistani.
   The agency said the women were driven to a hotel in Mashhad
after being questioned by security officers at the airport.
   After an emergency session, Kuwait's government said it will
send a three-man delegation on Wednesday morning ``to help Iranian
authorities'' secure the passengers' release.
   Iran asked Kuwait to send a high-ranking delegation to Mashhad
in northeastern Iran for direct talks with the hijackers.
   The hijackers earlier demanded fuel for the aircraft and
threatened to blow it up if the Iranians approached. IRNA initially
said the Iranians refueled the plane, but then said the gunmen were
still requesting fuel.
   Iranian security forces surrounded the plane at Mashhad airport
to keep it from taking off, IRNA and Tehran Radio said.
   Kuwait urged Iran to handle the incident ``wisely'' and
requested that the aircraft not be allowed to leave. Iran said it
would try to resolve the crisis peacefully but said the plane would
have to leave if it was not resolved quickly.
   The plane was commandeered three hours after it took off from
Bangkok with 97 passengers and 15 crew members.
   IRNA reported that the hijackers told the control tower at
Mashhad airport: ``We ask you Iranian officials to mediate between
us and the Kuwaiti government if you want.
   ``Our rights have been usurped ... We have 17 prisoners in
Kuwaiti jails who are under the worst kind of torture...
   ``If you do not want to mediate, we ask for fuel and other needs
and then we will take off.''
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said a Jordanian passenger with a
heart condition was freed several hours after the plane landed at
Mashhad at 7:30 a.m. (midnight EDT).
   The passenger, businessman Mustafa Issa, 42, later appeared on
Tehran television, also monitored in Cyprus, and said five or six
hijackers were demanding to fly on to an undetermined location.
   The passenger list included 30 Kuwaitis, 22 Britons, eight
Thais, various other nationalities and one person with a U.S. and
an Egyptian passport identified only as R. Attiaallaali.
   But the U.S. State Department said it believed no Americans were
aboard. In Washington, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the U.S.
government urged Iran to see that the hijackers are caught and
tried.
   Airline sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
pilot was an Iraqi.
   Elias H. Shiber, the airline's manager in Bangkok, said the
three members of Kuwait's ruling family aboard were Ibtesam Khaled
Al-Sabah, Fadil Khaled Al-Sabah and the wife of Khaled Anwar
Al-Sabah.
   Hundreds of Kuwaitis are related to Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, the target of an assassination attempt by
pro-Iranian extremists in 1986.
   Frances Watson, the wife of British passenger Albert Watson,
said she was waiting by the phone for more news about her husband,
an engineering teacher from Guisborough in northern England who was
returning from Bangkok.
   ``He is a very calm and cool-headed person and I am sure he will
take it all in his stride,'' she said. ``But I am terrified of what
could happen to him.''
   The 17 prisoners demanded by the hijackers were jailed in the
1983 bombings that targeted U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait.
   Shiites holding foreign hostages in Lebanon also have demanded
the prisoners' release. Nine Americans are among the 22 foreigners
missing and believed kidnapped in Lebanon.
   The overwhelming majority of Iran's population is Shiite. In the
Persian Gulf Arab states, Sunni Moslems dominate the government.
   Kuwait is the closest Arab nation to Iran and Iraq, which are
locked in a 7{-year-old war. Iran often accuses Kuwait of actively
aiding Iraq's military effort.
   The Kuwait News Agency quoted a spokesman for the airline as
saying contact was lost with the aircraft while it flew over
Muscat, Oman.
   Iran first denied the plane permission to land, but reversed its
decision when the pilot said the jet was running out of fuel, IRNA
said.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran told Tehran Radio that
hijackings were ``against humanitarian and Islamic principles and
unacceptable as a political tactic.''
   Diplomatic relations between Iran and Kuwait have been strained
since August when Iranians stormed the embassies of Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia in Tehran. Kuwait closed its embassy in Tehran and
brought its diplomats home.
   Pro-Iranian gunmen hijacked a Kuwait Airways jetliner to Tehran
in December 1984 and demanded the release of pro-Iranian Kuwaiti
prisoners. They killed two American passengers before Iranian
commandos stormed the aircraft, ending the six-day ordeal.

   Venanda Johnson is charged with stealing two
buses, but he can't be accused of inattentiveness.
   En route to Boston on Saturday, Johnson, 21, reportedly changed
a flat tire on a Greyhound bus he allegedly stole from a
Springfield station.
   After arriving, he pulled the bus into a maintenance area and
dutifully filled out a form noting the bus didn't seem to be
running well.
   And Johnson was upset when police on Sunday seized a second bus
he allegedly drove from the Boston garage to a home in Boston's
Mattapan section where he spent the night.
   ``I was told he yelled at the cops, `Hey, where are you going
with my bus?''' George Gravley, a spokesman for Greyhound Bus Lines
at company headquarters in Dallas, said Monday.
   Johnson, a New York resident, faces auto theft charges in
connection with an elaborate ruse that officials say included a bus
driver's uniform and a deep knowledge of Greyhound operations.

   The chief organizer of the ``Making Music

performance of the Soviet-American cultural exchange in Moscow next
October.
   ``It's meant to be pretty much a mirror image of this one,''
said Sarah Caldwell, director of the Boston Opera Company. ``It's
meant to continue to expose us to both American and Soviet life.''
   The three weeks of ballet, chamber music, ballads and poetry
ended Saturday night. During the five-hour finale, almost all the
Soviet performers who were still in Boston took part. At its end,
Bolshoi Ballet prima ballerina Maya Plisetskaya released a white
dove from the crowded stage.
   Tears rolled down Plisetskaya's face as the Soviet and Anerican
anthems played. The American audience cheered, many shouting
``spasebo,'' Russian for ``thank you,'' to the Soviet performers.
   The festival included 285 Soviet and American artists from the
Bolshoi, the Opera Company of Boston and the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.

   Michael Dukakis cautiously criticized Jesse
Jackson's involvement in the Panamanian standoff and expressed
irritation with Sen. Albert Gore Jr. on Monday as he struggled to
pull out a victory in the critical Wisconsin primary.
   In a long, final day of campaigning around the state, Dukakis
repeatedly likened himself to John F. Kennedy, who scored an
important primary victory in Wisconsin in his 1960 presidential
campaign.
   Campaigning before students in Stevens Point, in his last
appearance of the night, he urged that those who support him try to
round up a little last-minute help.
   ``When you go home tonight, make a few phone calls, get a hold
of your neighbors. Believe me, your work will make
the...difference,'' Dukakis said.
   Arriving back in Boston Monday night, he was asked about his
prospects in Wisconsin.
   ``We've worked hard. It looks good. But you never know until the
votes come in,'' he said.
   Earlier, Dukakis recalled Kennedy's success in reversing a round
of steel industry price hikes in 1962, and said he would summon
Chrysler Corp. President Lee Iacocca to the White House ``fast''
and demand that he drop plans to close a plant in Kenosha.
   Polls indicate Dukakis and Jackson are locked in a tight race in
Wisconsin, just as they are running neck and neck nationally in the
chase for national convention delegates.
   The Massachusetts governor said it was a ``bad idea'' for his
Democratic presidential rival to suggest taking on the role of
mediator between the Reagan administration and Panamanian strongman
Manuel Noriega.
   But he softened his criticism when he said he thought Jackson
had acted out of good intentions, and again when he said he
understood that Jackson had issued a clarifying statement on the
subject. Jackson said he had asked Noriega to leave the country,
not offered to mediate.
   Even so, Dukakis said, ``I think it's a bad idea for a private
citizen to try to inject himself'' into the situation.
   Asked about Jackson's much-heralded trip to Syria in 1984 when
he won the release of captured Navy flyer Robert Goodman, Dukakis
replied, ``I think the principle is the same.''
   Dukakis was less charitable toward Gore, who rays the governor
has been ``absurdly timid'' in criticizing Jackson for fear of
offending black voters.
   Dukakis cut off one reporter who began to ask about the subject,
and said, ``Sen. Gore ought to start campainging for the
presidency.''
   He noted that he and Jackson disagree on the Middle East,
proposals for an oil import fee and other subjects.
   Asked later if he thought Gore were serious about winning the
party's nomination, Dukakis said, ``I don't know what he's serious
about.''
   Dukakis noted that Gore hasn't won any contests outside the
South except the Nevada caucuses.
   Dukakis' criticism of Jackson came at a time when aides said the
Wisconsin race appeared extremely tight.
   While a weekend poll in the Milwaukee Journal gave Dukakis an
eight-point lead over Jackson in Wisconsin, the Massachusetts
governor and his aides portrayed Tuesday's primary as a much closer
match-up.
   ``It's too close to call,'' said Will Robinson, deputy political
director for the campaign. ``We'll take any kind of win we can
get.''
   Dukakis told reporters, ``I don't have to win'' in Wisconsin.
``I just have to win a good plurality of delegates by June 9,'' the
end of the primary season.
   Wisconsin is regarded as a critical test of Dukakis' candidacy,
following losses in earlier industrial state contests in Michigan
and Illinois. He and Jackson are running neck and neck in the race
for delegates to the Democratic National Convention, and many party
leaders have expressed concern that Jackson, a black liberal
contender with roots in the civil rights movement, would lead
Democrats to a crushing defeat in the fall.
   Thus, a defeat in Wisconsin would seriously damage Dukakis'
chances for winning the nomination, and would almost certainly
rekindle talk of a draft-Mario Cuomo movement in the two weeks
remaining before the New York governor's home state primary on
April 19.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Vice President George Bush stumbles on his
way to the White House this November, erstwhile rival Bob Dole
could wind up as the nation's top GOP spokesman.
   The Senate minority leader under a Democratic administration
could find himself playing the lead in a 1980s version of the 1960s
Ev and Charlie Show.
   It might well be called the Bob and Bob show, with Dole being
joined by House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois to counter a
Democratic president's programs and present alternatives to them.
   The Ev of Ev and Charlie was Senate Minority leader Everett
McKinley Dirksen of Illinois.
   Dirksen teamed with House Minority Leader Charles Halleck of
Indiana in a regular series of televised news conferences, Dirksen
became the undisputed ``Mr. Republican'' of his era.
   Dole, crowded out of the 1988 Republican field by Bush, has
returned to his leadership position in the Senate, serving notice
he intends to prod the GOP into opening its arms to a wider
constituency.
   Republicans should, Dole says, address issues of concern to the
homeless and the poor and embrace programs to deal with narcotics,
day care, education, long-term health care, Medicaid and Medicare.
   ``We must, above all, give more Americans a reason to come our
way and at the same time strengthen the commitment of our
staunchest supporters,'' Dole said last week.
   With a sense of humor that can be dark and biting, Dole will
have his own distinct style and image if he emerges as national
spokesman for the GOP.
   Dirksen was ``full of fun and thunder,'' said Dirksen biographer
Neil McNeil.
   McNeil, in his 1970 ``Dirksen: Portrait of a Public Man,'' said
the Senate minority leader became a television superstar despite a
complete lack of the veneer said to be essential to a politician in
the age of television.
   ``His tousled hair, long his trademark, was an easily
recognizable ensign,'' McNeil wrote. ``His deep-throated husky
voice, his flamboyant manners and his often astonishing use of a
rococo vocabulary all tickled the viewing millions.''
   Washington Post cartoonist Herblock caricatured Dirksen as a
melancholy clown, Halleck as a buffoon and straight man.
   Halleck resented the Ev and Charlie tag. He took his
partisanship seriously.
   But Dirksen said he liked the name, said it reminded him of such
other all-American duos as corned beef and cabbage and ham and eggs.
   Some Republicans said they thought the two stood in poor
contrast to John F. Kennedy, the nation's new, youthful and
handsome Democratic president.
   One complained about Dirksen's ``fuzzy hair'' and Halleck's
``big red nose.''
   ``None of this troubled Dirksen,'' McNeil wrote, ``for even as
the criticisms were being made, he and Halleck were getting
television and press coverage to make the opposition's case against
the Kennedy administration. In time, he sensed, the criticism would
wane and he would be better off for the national notoriety he was
now receiving.''
   Dirksen and Halleck used the Ev and Charlie routine to showcase
criticism of the Kennedy domestic program.
   ``It may be called the New Frontier, but the Kennedy program is
the old New Deal taken out of an old warming oven,'' Dirksen said.
   He scored the administration for ``deficit spending, increased
government controls, increases in the government payroll, more
welfare statism and that inevitable price which we must pay the
piper, more taxes.''
   By mid 1962 the Ev and Charlie show was fully launched and
obviously effective in stating the Republican case. The ridicule
evaporated.
   No Republican leader since has had anything quite resembling his
disheveled flair, rumpled charm and widespread appeal.

   In laid-back California, a little levity has
been a hallmark at PSA. But the commuter airline's new parent,
USAir, is lowering the curtain on one PSA feature: stand-up
routines by flight attendants.
   For example, on a recent flight from San Jose to Los Angeles,
PSA flight attendant Marka McDougall went into her act as the
engines revved up.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' Ms. McDougall said, ``We'd like to
welcome you aboard Flight 1733 on our way to Seattle.''
   Following a panicky gasp in the cabin, Ms. McDougall added:
``Just kidding. I wanted to see if you were listening.''
   Ms. McDougall, who says about 10 percent of her colleagues go
for such laughs, was on a roll.
   ``If you are traveling with infants or small children, or anyone
resembling a small child, place your mask on first, then assist the
child _ providing they've been good,'' she said. ``And now, for
those of you who have not been in a car since 1962, we're going to
show you how to fasten your seat belts.''
   But the managers of Arlington, Va.-based USAir are not amused,
and this week is Ms. McDougall's last as a kidder. USAir is
completing a $385 million takeover of PSA.
   ``Our policy is that we discourage that sort of thing because
the information is very serious and should be delivered in that
vein,'' said David Shipley, assistant vice president for public
relations at USAir.
   PSA, which has smiles painted on the noses of its jets, believes
that a light touch is helpful, said Sherry Hendry, division vice
president for the airline's in-flight and dining services.
   ``As long as the safety announcements are done in the right
manner, we think a sense of humor is appreciated at a time that is
perceived to be a hassle,'' she said.

   Ben and Jerry, those irrepressible Vermont ice
cream makers, found out that it's easier to make Coffee Heath Bar
Crunch than to make a New York subway station shine.
   About a year ago, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, whose Ben &
Jerry's ice cream has become a favorite of the upscale ice cream
set, proposed to spruce up and maintain a subway station on
Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side.
   Cohen, just down from Vermont, found the station ``really
disgusting.'' Many New Yorkers would say it's better than most.
   Cohen and Greenfield offered to spend their New York advertising
budget for the year _ $200,000 to $250,000 _ cleaning, painting and
maintaining the station.
   The Transit Authority said yes. The Transport Workers Union said
no because Cohen and Greenfield wanted to use some non-union
workers on the project.
   Negotiations dragged on and Ben & Jerry finally set a March 31
deadline. That passed too; the matter went before an independent
arbitrator who is expected to rule soon.
   So on Monday, Ben & Jerry set up an ice cream wagon and a van at
a park across the street from the station, and began doling out
free ice cream as a consolation prize for passengers emerging from
the filthy subway stop. Cohen and Greenfield were there to promise
that they'd keep trying to spruce it up.
   Nobody seemed to care about the station, though _ not while
there was free ice cream to be had.

<HEAD>Average U.S. Household Size Half Civil War Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American households have shrunk to their
smallest size ever, containing just half as many people as at the
start of the Civil War.
   The Census Bureau reports that the average household contained
2.64 people as of last July 1, continuing a long-term decline. By
comparison, the 1860 census found an average household of 5.28
people.
   While the household size has declined, the number of households
has continued to climb, topping 90 million for the first time in
1987, the bureau said Monday.
   Household size is shrinking because the number of households is
increasing faster than the overall population. This is occurring,
said bureau population expert Campbell Gibson, because of changes
in the country's age structure.
   The many Americans born in the post-World War II baby boom are
now in their 20s and 30s, when they are most likely to set up
households on their own, he said.
   The number of households rose from 80.4 million in 1980 to 88.8
million in 1986 and is now past the 90 million mark.
   At the same time the average number of persons per household
declined from 2.75 in 1985 to 2.65 in 1986 and now to 2.64, Gibson
said.
   By comparison, the 1970 Census found the average household
contained 3.14 people. In 1930 households averaged more than 4
people, and they averaged more than 5 in 1880. The nation's first
census in 1790 found an average household size of 5.79 people.
   While the growing number of ever smaller households continues a
trend, Gibson pointed out that household growth isn't outpacing
population increases as fast as in the 1970s.
   The same age factors that are increasing households now also
occurred then, Gibson said. But in addition, in the 1970s the
proportion of households in each age group was also growing. That
has not continued in the 1980s, he said.
   ``This could be occurring for a number of reasons,'' Gibson said.
   For example, in this decade more young people have chosen to
remain home with their parents instead of setting up housekeeping
on their own, as many had done in the 1970s. This could be caused
by the increasing cost of housing, he said.
   Delays in marriage, while young people pursue careers and
school, have also been widely reported as a factor, but Gibson
cautioned that it is too simplistic to attribute all of the
household changes to this.
   ``There's a whole bunch of things'' that affect the rates, he
said.
   For example, the elderly tend to have high household rates
because a fair number are widowed, resulting in many one-person
households.
   Continued low birth rates in the United States are also a
factor. The presence of children increases household size, while
populations with a larger share of adults tend to have smaller
households.
   Asked what the future holds, Gibson said he expects to see
households continue to lead population in growth rates over the
next few years. ``But that should change at some point'' as the
smaller ``baby bust'' generation born following the baby boom comes
into the household formation ages.
   While the national trend was reflected in most parts of the
nation, Gibson cited two states that differ.
   In California and Utah, household growth rates were only
slightly different from those for population, he said.
   In California, the increasing number of Hispanic and Asian
residents likely is the reason, Gibson said, since those groups
tend to have more people per household.
   Utah, Gibson said, has larger households because it maintains
higher fertility than other states, largely because of the
influence of the Mormon religion.
   Households are defined as occupied housing units containing one
or more people. The number of households is, on average, smaller
than the number of families because the definition of a family
requires at least two people, while there are many one-person
households.

   Some 23,000 children and their parents turned
the White House south lawn into a kiddie carnival, celebrating an
Easter Egg Roll that has been a tradition for 110 years.
   The children were entertained by an Uncle Sam on stilts, by tiny
actor Emmanuel Lewis of the ``Webster'' TV show, and by all sorts
of cartoon characters from the comic strip ``Peanuts.''
   Monday's crowd filled the White House's south grounds where
normally helicopters deliver VIPs, bands march and presidents speak.
   Vice President George Bush brought his wife, three children and
five of his 10 grandchildren. He seemed to have a good time
autographing wooden Easter eggs.
   The rolling was only a small part of the festivities. It
consisted of eight youngsters lining up and using wooden spoons to
urge their respective eggs toward the finish line. The winners each
got a brightly colored wooden egg. So did the losers.
   On the grounds also were hidden eggs autographed by hundreds of
movie stars ranging from Ann-Margret to Efrem Zimbalist Jr.

<HEAD>Major Precedent Unlikely in Libel Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record $3 million libel award against CBS
that the Supreme Court has refused to disturb is not likely to have
widespread impact on the news media, says an authority on libel law.
   Henry Kaufman of the Libel Defense Resource Center in New York
City said the case does not establish a significant precedent
because the facts involved are unique.
   But Kaufman did say that the case, stemming from a broadcast on
a CBS-owned television station in Chicago, changes the
psychological landscape.
   ``This is the first libel award that has broken through the
psychological $1 million barrier on appeal, the first that has been
able to make it through the process intact,'' he said.
   Kaufman, whose organization is funded by the news media,
expressed disappointment along with CBS officials that the Supreme
Court on Monday left the libel judgment intact.
   News organizations had hoped the case could be used to mount a
First Amendment attack against punitive damages in libel cases,
Kaufman said. ``That opportunity has passed for the time being,''
he said.
   ``We're disappointed,'' said Doug Jacobs, associate general
counsel for CBS Inc. ``We believed these issues were important
enough for review.''
   The case stems from a suit by Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.
of Louisville, Ky., which makes Viceroy cigarettes. It accused CBS
and WBBM-TV anchorman Walter Jacobson in Chicago of libeling it in
a Nov. 11, 1981, broadcast.
   Jacobson, in a nightly feature called ``Walter Jacobson's
Perspective,'' said there was a Viceroy advertising strategy to
attract young people to smoking by relating cigarettes ``to pot,
wine, beer and sex.'' He said the idea was to present cigarette
smoking as ``an initiation into the adult world ... as an illicit
pleasure.''
   A federal jury awarded the cigarette company $5 million. The 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld $3 million of the award
against CBS and $50,000 against Jacobson.
   The $3 million award _ plus some $400,000 in interest _ is about
four times the largest previous damage judgment against a news
organization upheld on appeal. Awards upheld on appeal average
between $100,000 and $150,000.
   In the CBS case, the appeals court rejected arguments that the
broadcast was intended as opinion and thus could not be libelous.
   The appeals court said the remarks about Viceroy were intended
to be factual, even if the tone of the broadcast made it sound like
something else.
   The appeals court also rejected CBS's claim that the broadcast
was truthful.
   There was insufficient evidence that the cigarette company
actually adopted a strategy of attracting young smokers by relating
cigarettes ``to pot, wine, beer and sex,'' the appeals court said.
   Finally, the appeals court ruled that Jacobson and CBS acted
with ``actual malice'' in broadcasting the commentary.
   For a public figure to win a libel suit, it must be shown there
was actual malice _ that statements were made with knowledge they
were false or with reckless disregard for the truth. The cigarette
company was held to be a public figure.
   In other action, the court:
   _Left intact rulings in a case from St. Louis that public
airports may not ban all demonstrations, soliciting and
distribution of political and religious literature at their
terminals.
   _Agreed to review rulings that limited Korean Air Lines'
financial liability for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died _
the shooting down of a KAL passenger jet over Soviet airspace.
   _Reinforced the right of hospitals to challenge federal
regulations limiting the amount of money they are reimbursed for
treating Medicare patients. The unanimous court was led by Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, writing his first opinion since joining the
court Feb. 18.
   _Rejected a challenge to New York City's rent-control law that
limits yearly increases for affected apartments to 7.5 percent.
   _Agreed to decide whether New York's powerful Board of Estimate
_ the city's mayor, city council president and comptroller and the
president of each of the city's five boroughs _ must be
reapportioned to meet equal-voting standards.

<HEAD>Carriers Report Low Benefit Payout Per Premium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The providers of all-risk crop insurance last
year paid out the lowest amount of benefits per premium dollar
since a new program went into effect in 1981, according to the
American Association of Crop Insurers.
   Farmers carried $6.07 billion worth of ``multiple peril'' crop
insurance in 1987 on a record 62 million acres of production.
   E. Eugene Gantz, executive vice president of the association,
said Monday that farmers paid $274 million in 1987 premiums and
received $335 million in loss payments for the year. Nationally,
that meant for each $1 paid in premiums, farmers received $1.22 in
indemnities.
   The multiple peril crop insurance program includes commercial
companies that are reinsured against catastrophic loss by the
Federal Crop Insurance Corp., an agency of the Agriculture
Department. The FCIC also handles insurance directly through master
marketers, who account for about 20 percent of the total.
   Up to 30 percent of a farmer's all-risk insurance premium is
subsidized by the FCIC.
   When the federal subsidies are included, the 1987 premiums
totaled $365 million, compared with the benefits of $335 million.
Thus, the 1987 loss ratio was 0.92, or 92 cents paid out for each
$1 of premium.
   Gantz said that was the lowest ratio since the multiple peril
crop insurance program began in 1981.
   Under the program, farmers can buy varying levels of coverage
for a variety of crops to insure them against loss from floods,
drought, insects and other natural causes.
   ``As we look forward to 1988, we hope for another good loss
ratio performance,'' Gantz said. ``But we're concerned with dry
conditions already cropping up in the West and Midwest.''
   The deadline for farmers to sign up for 1988 crop insurance is
April 15 in most areas of the country (it was March 31 in some of
the early planting areas of the South), he said.
   Farmers who produce spring-planted crops also should keep in
mind that without crop insurance they are not eligible for
Agriculture Department disaster assistance, such as low-interest
loans from the Farmers Home Administration, Gantz said.
   The 1987 coverage on 62 million acres of crops compared with
60.7 million acres in 1986 and 46.5 million acres when the program
began in 1981. A low point was reached in 1983 when plantings were
cut sharply by drought and government acreage programs. Only 31.3
million acres of crops were insured that year.
   However, the mix of crops and variations in kinds of coverage
have resulted in wide variations of coverage value. Last year's
$6.07 billion in coverage was down from more than $6.22 billion in
1986, for example, despite the record acreage. And in 1985,
coverage totaled nearly $7.17 billion on $59.1 million.

   The Soviet Union has been given the go-ahead
by the Agriculture Department to buy an additional 1 million metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Acting Undersecretary Thomas O. Kay said Monday that since April
1987, the subsidized sales of wheat to the Soviets have totaled
more than 11.8 million tons under previously announced allocations
of the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   More than 7.6 million tons of the 11.8 million tons of
subsidized wheat bought by the Soviet Union has gone to fill its
commitment under the fifth and final year of a long-term grain
agreement with the United States.
   The pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on Moscow to buy at
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   If more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year, the Soviets
are required to seek U.S. approval. The Soviets have been given
approval to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans.
   If Moscow buys all of the new authorization, that would push
wheat sales in the last year of the agreement to more than 8.6
million tons. All of the wheat has been subsidized.
   In addition, the Soviets have bought 4.1 million tons of
non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of U.S. soybeans; and 1.3 million
tons of soybean meal.
   Under EEP, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or another authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   The subsidies, or bonuses, have run between less than $20 to
more than $40 per ton, roughly 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.

   More of the Farmers Home Administration's
rural development loans may be targeted to areas of high
unemployment.
   FmHA administrator Vance L. Clark said Monday a proposed rule
change would direct a higher proportion of the agency's business
and industrial loan guarantees to smaller companies where there is
high unemployment.
   The ``B&I'' program involves guarantees by FmHA on loans made by
commercial lenders to provide jobs through new or expanded
businesses in rural areas.
   Loan guarantees would range from 70 percent to 90 percent of the
loan value, with the higher guarantee reserved for smaller loans.
   A spokesman, Joe O'Neill, said B&I loan guarantees range up to
$10 million per project. Those of up to $2 million would carry the
90 percent guarantee; $2 million to $5 million, 80 percent; and $5
million to $10 million, 70 percent, he said.

<HEAD>Cosmetics Firms Warned To Stop Making Anti-Aging Claims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says it is
time for cosmetic companies to stop talking and start changing
labels that claim skin creams can retard or reverse aging of the
skin.
   The federal agency wrote 22 companies on Monday that it will
take another look at the labels in 30 days _ and then crack down on
any that persist in misleading claims.
   ``We believe that FDA has clearly stated its views regarding the
types of claims that can appropriately be made on cosmetic skin
care products and the types of claims that make skin products
unapproved new drugs,'' wrote John M. Taylor, associate
commissioner for regulatory affairs.
   ``Accordingly, we do not believe that a detailed review or a
prolonged discussion regarding individual product labeling is
necessary. We hope that you will make the changes in your labeling
that are necessary to bring it into compliance with the act and
with FDA's stated views.''
   The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics, which can be
sold without pre-approval by the FDA, as products intended to
cleanse or to beautify superficially.
   In written warnings to the cosmetic industry last year, the
agency said that when a product is said to counteract, retard or
control the aging process or to rejuvenate, repair or renew the
skin, then those statements put the product in the drug category _
with all its stringent scientific review requirements. That is so,
the letter said, because such claims indicate that a ``function of
the body, or that the structure of the body, will be affected by
the product.''
   The FDA said then it was ``unaware of any substantial scientific
evidence that demonstrates the safety and effectiveness'' of the
so-called anti-aging skin care products.
   Implicit in the latest letter was the FDA view that talks
started with the companies last spring intended to lead to
voluntary changes in labeling claims have gone on long enough.
   Some companies have modified their labels since last spring, but
the FDA said last November it could not accept the labeling claims
continuing to appear on many products.
   The latest letter said the agency will examine the labeling and
promotions of the creams in 30 days and that a product still in
``substantial violation'' may be subject to immediate regulatory
action. This can include seizure of products on shelves and court
injunctions against further distribution.
   The FDA action does not involve Retin-A, a prescription acne
medication that was widely publicized recently after a study
suggested it was effective in removing small wrinkles caused by sun
damage to the skin. The FDA did not release the names of the
companies that received the letter.

<HEAD>Some Labor Favorites Not Holding Up Well In Presidential Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One by one, the favorite presidential
candidates of some of the nation's union leaders are falling by the
wayside.
   Eight days ago it was Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, the
personal choice of United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber.
Gephardt finished a distant third in Michigan's caucuses and
withdrew last Monday.
   Today, in Wisconsin's primary, leaders of the United Steel
Workers union expect their preferred choice, Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon, to be weeded from the Democratic field.
   ``Quite sadly, tomorrow is going to show Simon to be yesterday's
tomatoes,'' Joel Vattendahl, director of USW's 14,000-member
District 32 headquartered in Milwaukee, said on the eve of the
primary.
   While the union was abiding by AFL-CIO guidelines to encourage
their members to support any candidate of their choice, Simon had
clearly become the choice by default of the USW's leaders.
   The first choice of USW President Lynn Williams had been New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whom he has served as an adviser on
industrial policy.
   Vattendahl now believes that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
will edge out Jesse Jackson among the union's members in Wisconsin,
who are mostly foundry workers, with Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
also finishing ahead of Simon.
   ``I would have thought Simon would have caught on better; he's
been with us for 30 years and we've been with him,'' Vattendahl
said. ``But it's not happening that way.''
   Going into today's votes, Simon actually has more delegates to
the Democratic National Convention in July among union members than
any of the other candidates, all from his victory in the Illinois
primary March 15.
   The latest AFL-CIO tabulations show him with 20 elected labor
delegates, followed by Jackson with 15, Gore with 10, Dukakis with
six and Gephardt with two.
   The steelworkers were instrumental in persuading Simon to stay
in the race through the Illinois primary and had hoped he would do
well enough in Wisconsin to remain a candidate through the April 26
primary in Pennsylvania, where the union has its biggest political
strength.
   But Gary Hubbard, a USW spokesman, said Dukakis and Jackson have
been on the phone with steelworkers union members around the
country who had been supporting Simon, offering them delegate slots
for their support.
   ``So far it's being resisted,'' he added.
   Leaders of Wisconsin's biggest union, the 48,000 teachers who
belong to the National Education Association, also believe Dukakis
will edge out Jackson among their members today.
   Jackson, however, has endeared himself to Wisconsin union
members facing the greatest strife: 5,500 workers at a Kenosha
Chrysler plant to be closed next summer and striking meatpackers at
Cudahy and paper workers at DePere.
   ``Al Gore visited us and Dukakis showed up at the Labor Temple
in Green Bay,'' said Roger Murphry, one of 370 mostly white Paper
Workers on strike the past 10 months against International Paper
Co.'s De Pere mill.
   ``But they're just reading off the script Jesse wrote,'' Murphy
said.
   Mark Rosenbaum, president of United Food and Commercial Workers
Local P-40 in Cudahy, which is striking the Smithfield Foods'
meatpacking plant, has made trips to California to raise campaign
money on Jackson's behalf.
   ``The picket line is white, the strikebreakers are black,'' said
Allen Zack, a UFCW spokesman. ``The company orchestrated letters to
Jackson from scabs saying that he was selling them out. And he
replied: A scab is a scab. Our Cudahy people are big Jackson fans.''
   Jackson also has won the endorsement of UAW Local 72 in Kenosha,
which represents the Chrysler workers, after appearing with them in
protest rallies in January when the company announced its intention
to close the plant next summer.
   Both Gore and Dukakis in the past week have denounced Chrysler
Chairman Lee Iacocca in campaign appearances, but labor leaders
view those actions as too little and too late.
   ``The problem is people who are striking or are in trouble are
the ones who vote, and those who are working don't,'' said Joan
Baggett, political director for the bricklayers union and a Dukakis
supporter. ``That raises a real question about us getting a
November-electable candidate.''

   Jesse Jackson's showing in today's Wisconsin
primary will be a key measure of his emergence as a candidate who
could have sufficient support to win the Democratic nomination and
the presidency, pollsters say.
   As Jackson has improved his ability to win votes, the poll
analysts noted Monday, the expectations for his campaign have
increased. If he has done well, they said, he now needs to do
better still.
   ``It may be a constantly moving target,'' said CBS News pollster
Keating Holland. ``The frontier is moving. Twenty percent of the
white Democratic vote and all the black vote is not going to win
the election in November.''
   Jackson gained co-frontrunner status when he upset Gov. Michael
Dukakis in the Michigan caucuses March 26. No polls were done there
to indicate the demographics of Jackson's support.
   Dukakis then beat Jackson in Connecticut's primary, where
Jackson got about 20 percent of the white vote. In Wisconsin, a
Milwaukee Journal poll last week put Jackson's white backing at 30
percent.
   ``In this state certainly he's a viable candidate,'' said Jeff
Browne, the Journal editor who ran the poll. Though it gave Dukakis
a slim lead, he said, it probably understated Jackson's support by
underestimating black turnout.
   Blacks have been the most reliable of Jackson's supporters
throughout the primary season, voting for him with near-unanimity.
At the same time, ``You have to have white voters to be a viable
candidate,'' said Mary Klett, poll analyst for NBC News. ``There
are some white voters going his way. But it will have to be much
larger before he could get the nomination.''
   Wisconsin and the New York primary April 19 are crucial to
indicate that vote-getting ability, Klett said. ``What happens in
Wisconsin is going to be pivotal in New York,'' she said. Jackson,
she suggested, ``has to win one of those states or both.''
   ``I wouldn't put a number on it; it's the number of Democrats
that are voting for him,'' Klett said. ``When he gets most of them
voting for him, that's when he becomes viable.''
   There are other measures as well. In Wisconsin, the Journal poll
last week showed Vice President George Bush leading Jackson in a
hypothetical general election race by 50 percent to 36 percent.
   ``That strikes me as extremely close for Jackson in this state,
considering how well known Bush is and how well liked (President)
Reagan is,'' Browne said. He noted that Dukakis and Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. both fared even better in matchups against Bush.
   Another issue in gauging Jackson's strength is in the nature of
the white votes he is attracting. Exit polls in Connecticut said he
did best with liberals and lost the blue-collar vote _ critical in
the general election _ by 2-1. An analysis of the Michigan caucus
results also indicated that Jackson was not particularly strong in
blue-collar precincts, Holland said.
   Still another measure is the share of voters who have a
favorable opinion of Jackson. Although his rating has improved, the
last national survey by CBS News and The New York Times, done March
19-22, said more white Democrats had an unfavorable opinion of him
_ 39 percent _ than the 31 percent favorable. Holland said. Among
all white voters it was 46 percent unfavorable to 22 percent
favorable, he said.
   ``You say to yourself, very few white Republicans are going to
vote for him. You then write off half the Democrats as well, and
you're not looking at much of an electoral base,'' said Holland.
``You can see why people will be putting increasing hurdles in
front of him.''
   ``He is increasing his white vote,'' the CBS analyst said. ``If
that's the case it may be acceptable to say, Let's see how far you
can go with this. Can you reach the point where you can win in
November? Twenty percent is not there. I would guess it's not 30
percent.''
   I.A. Lewis, chief of polling for the Los Angeles Times, said he
retained his view that Jackson is able but unlikely to win the
nomination and unable to win in November. He cited Jackson's
liberal positions as well as ``an element of racism that exists in
America today.''
   Nonetheless, `There's already been a profound change. Jackson
has been to a certain extent legitimized by his very impressive
victories,'' said Lewis. In turn, he said, whatever the outcome,
``Jackson is legitimizing blacks as legitimate presidential
contenders.''

   Attorney General Edwin Meese's wife, Ursula,
will undergo questioning shortly in the criminal investigation of
her husband about her own $40,000-a-year job, say sources familiar
with the case.
   The office of independent counsel James McKay is trying to
determine whether longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach in effect
helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending Mrs. Meese for
jobs, said sources familiar with the probe, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Mrs. Meese has retained the same Washington law firm
representing her husband, said James Rocap, one of Meese's lawyers.
She will either make a federal grand jury appearance or be
questioned by investigators from McKay's office.
   McKay said last week that his investigation of Meese, also
encompassing an examination of the circumstances surrounding Mrs.
Meese's job, would continue at least until the end of April.
   McKay last month subpoenaed records relating to Mrs. Meese's
post with the Washington chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society,
said a lawyer for the chapter, James Bierbower.
   A lawyer for Wallach, George Walker, has told The Washington
Post that Wallach had suggested Mrs. Meese for a job with a local
radio station owned by the Bender family of Washington.
   Mrs. Meese took the position with the MS Society instead.
However, Bierbower said the Bender Foundation of Washington,
controlled by the same family that owns the radio station, is
contributing the $40,000 a year that constitutes Mrs. Meese's
salary with the MS group.
   Calls to the Bender Foundation seeking its reasons for paying
Mrs. Meese's salary were not returned.
   Mrs. Meese has been a volunteer for the MS Society since 1981
and for the past two years has been in charge of a program called
Operation Job Match, matching MS victims with employers.
   Mrs. Meese also was questioned in an earlier independent
counsel's investigation of Meese in 1984. In that investigation,
independent counsel Jacob Stein probed Meese's failure to include
in his financial disclosure statements a $15,000 loan by Edwin
Thomas to Mrs. Meese. Thomas later became Meese's assistant
counselor at the White House. The independent counsel found no
connection between the loan and federal jobs obtained by Thomas,
his wife and his son.
   In another development Monday, Justice Department sources said
Meese will face an ethics investigation by his own department's
Office of Professional Responsibility if McKay doesn't seek an
indictment. Such an inquiry ultimately could lead to a
recommendation to President Reagan that Meese be fired.
   Former Assistant Attorney General William Weld's files on the
attorney general's dealings with Wallach were moved to OPR last
Friday, the sources said.
   Material collected by Weld's criminal division last year led to
McKay's criminal investigation of Meese.
   McKay said Friday he has insufficient evidence to date to
warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his
involvement with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline touted by Wallach
or his involvement with the regional Bell telephone companies at a
time when he held $14,000 in Baby Bell stock. In December, McKay
said he didn't have sufficient evidence at that time to warrant
seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his assistance to
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   McKay said that if he decides not to seek a criminal indictment
of Meese, the independent counsel's office ``will refer all of
those matters for review and action by the appropriate
administrative authorities,'' a reference to OPR.
   OPR's chief, Michael Shaheen, denied assertions by Justice
Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, that his
office had begun examining Meese's ties to longtime friend Wallach

   That review was halted when McKay launched his criminal
investigation of Meese last May 11, the sources said.

<HEAD>Jackson Brings In $2 Million Plus in March</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's once-impoverished presidential
campaign is showing new fund-raising strength, collecting an
impressive $2.2 million in donations during March _ more than he
raised during all of last year.
   The sum, coming mostly in contributions of $50 or less,
represents a dramatic upswing for what Jackson frequently boasts is
the ``poor campaign with the rich message.''
   Bob Farmer, finance chairman for the Democratic field's
consistent fund-raising leader, Michael Dukakis, was laudatory when
told Monday about Jackson's money.
   ``That's a tremendous achievement for Rev. Jackson,'' he said.
``Anybody that can raise $2 million in a month is a hero to me.''
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, collected donations
totaling more than $2.5 million during March, Farmer said. Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee raised about $1.5 million during
March, his campaign said last week.
   Jackson has been picking up most of his money in small
contributions through an aggressive direct-mail and telemarketing
program. The program banked $1 million during March, said Jackson's
mail consultant, Mal Warwick of Berkeley, Calif. He said the
returns are the most impressive of any campaign he has ever
conducted in 10 years of fund-raising.
   Farmer said Dukakis has gotten contributions averaging $135 each
over the past 90 days.
   During all of 1987, Jackson raised just under $2 million, while
Dukakis raised $10.8 million.
   ``He has emerged as a significant player and that's reflected in
his financial performance,'' Farmer said of Jackson. ``You're
beginning to see this as a two-man race and the fund raising is the
first benchmark of success.''
   He said Jackson ``should be very proud'' of his mail returns.
   Jackson campaign spokeswoman Pam Smith said Jackson's March
receipts surprised even campaign manager Gerald Austin, who had
projected contributions of about $1 million. In all, Jackson
collected $3 million, including about $800,000 in federal matching
funds. Dukakis took in about $3.4 million, including $875,000 in
federal matching funds.
   Jackson's fund-raising boost is timely as the expensive New York
primary approaches on April 19.
   ``They're really banking for New York,'' Smith said, noting that
television ad time in New York City is particularly expensive. By
contrast, she said, the campaign spent a total of $100,000 on
today's Wisconsin primary, with about half going to TV ads.
   Jackson generally relies on a grassroots network of volunteers,
eliminating the large payroll common to more wealthy campaigns.
   Warwick said Jackson's mail returns ``have picked up since Super
Tuesday,'' when Jackson polled first in popular vote and second in
delegates across 20 state primaries and caucuses on March 8.
   In addition to the direct mail campaign, Smith said Jackson
raised about $140,000 during a two-day fund-raising swing through
California, where national campaign chairman Willie Brown put on a
series of fund-raising events.
   Jackson also collected about $120,000 at events in Michigan
prior to the March 26 caucuses where he won a landslide victory.
   Dukakis got about half his March donations from three days of
big-ticket fund-raising events in Washington, New York and Boston,
Farmer said.

<HEAD>Nofziger Supporters Urge Leniency In Friday Sentencing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Cabinet secretaries and the Secret Service
director have attested to Lyn Nofziger's character in letters to
the judge who will sentence the former presidential aide for
illegal lobbying.
   Letters signed by Energy Secretary John S. Herrington, Labor
Secretary Ann McLaughlin and Secret Service Director John R.
Simpson are among 62 attached to a defense brief that urges a short
term of unsupervised probation for Nofziger.
   In a three-page letter, Herrington urged U.S. District Judge
Thomas Flannery to show ``compassion and understanding'' for
Nofziger.
   ``Society has been paid by what he has gone through in this
trial and the effect that it has had on him as an individual,''
Herrington said.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., one of four members of Congress who sent
letters, urged Flannery to consider ``balancing the requirements of
justice with the quality of mercy.''
   Simpson wrote about Nofziger's role as White House spokesman on
March 30, 1981, after President Reagan had been shot and taken to
George Washington University Hospital.
   ``Once Mr. Nofziger took the podium,'' Simpson recalled, he
quickly became aware ``of the rapport and the trust the press had
for any statements he made.''
   Nofziger, 63, is scheduled to be sentenced Friday on three
counts of illegally lobbying former White House colleagues on
behalf of Wedtech Corp., the manufacturer of the A-10 anti-tank
plane, and a maritime engineers union.
   He could receive a two-year prison term and a $10,000 fine for
each of the three felony violations of the Ethics in Government Act.
   Last week, independent counsel James C. McKay urged a prison
term of unspecified length and a fine, arguing that Nofziger
flouted the law and was unrepentant following his conviction Feb.
11.
   Nofziger had likened his crime to ``running a stop sign.''
   The defense brief that was filed Monday said imprisonment
``would unnecessarily add to the degradation and humiliation Mr.
Nofziger has already suffered as a result of his indictment and
trial.''
   Accusing McKay of making a ``vindictive'' and ``mean-spirited''
sentencing request, defense lawyers Robert Plotkin and E. Lawrence
Barcella said ``it is inconceivable that a sentence other than
probation is appropriate under these circumstances.''
   Former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., said Nofziger ``has been deeply
wounded and punished _ physically, emotionally and financially.''
   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., called Nofziger ``a man of
impeccable character and integrity'' who would ``never do anything
which he understood to be morally wrong.''
   Others who signed letters were Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., Rep.
Mervyn W. Dymally, D-Calif., and former Health and Human Services
Secretary Margaret Heckler, now U.S. ambassador to Ireland;
   Former U.S. Treasurer Angela Buchanan; Joe Rodgers, U.S.
ambassador to France; and Carol Boyce Hallett, the ambassador to
the Bahamas.
   The defense brief repeated a longstanding contention that
Nofziger didn't intend to violate the post-employment lobbying
restrictions, a point hotly disputed by McKay's sentencing memo.
   Nofziger ``does not dispute the need for fair, clear and
balanced post-employment restriction'' but, his lawyers contended,
if the statute were clearer he ``likely would not be before the
court for sentencing.''

   Here is the text of Jesse Jackson's letter to
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, dated March 23, 1988.
It was released by the Jackson campaign.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dear General Noriega:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On behalf of all those around the world who see and feel the
agony of the Panamanian people, I am writing to appeal to you _ for
all of us _ to pursue peace and to put an end to this crisis. The
whole forest is being set afire to smoke you out, and the strategy
is causing great suffering in Panama _ a suffering seen around the
world.
   The livelihood, health and safety of Panamanians are threatened.
It is time to put these considerations in the proper perspective
for the country's good. A judgment for a greater good must be made.
A judgment for Panama and for the region must be made!
   By us working together for peace, we can help heal the sick,
feed the hungry and put your country back together. I have been to
Panama several times and have a great feeling, sensitivity and
respect for the people of Panama. I agonize daily as I watch the
suffering. I have talked with people in Panama who now have
desperation added to their destitution.
   I make this appeal reluctantly because I know the history of our
country with your country has been a complex one. But suffice it to
say that the Panama Canal Treaty brought us closer together in
harmony.
   I am appealing for us to relieve the people of the suffering and
the bloodshed that may occur. I am anxious to do whatever I can to
help alleviate the suffering, but we must act decisively and
quickly. I appeal to you for us to find a way to end the crisis now.
   I am therefore asking Cirilo McSween, my dear friend who has
accompanied me to your country on my visits, to see you immediately
so that these dialogues surrounding this moral appeal may begin.
   Repectfully and in Peace,
   Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson

<HEAD>Mexico Cheapest, Norway Most Expensive In US Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico had the lowest labor costs last year
and Norway had the highest as measured in dollars, the Labor
Department says.
   Average hourly costs in Mexico went down to $1.37 from $1.49 in
1986, the department said in its report, released Monday. Though
wages more than doubled in Mexican pesos, the exchange value of the
peso dropped so far that the dollar cost declined.
   Brazilian workers saw their wages and benefits rise when
measured in cruzados, but in dollar terms there was a decline to
$1.49 from $1.60 an hour because of the low value of the domestic
currency.
   Brazil and Mexico are the Third World's two biggest debtors, a
situation that tends to drive down the price of their currencies.
They were the only countries where the dollar cost of labor was
reported to have dropped in the year.
   The figures take account of the fall in the price of the dollar,
and of changes in local pay rates. The costs of social insurance
and other benefits are also figured. But the figures do not
consider whether some workers are more efficient than others.
   Norway's average compensation of $17.58 an hour was nearly 13
times Mexico's dollar amount. The U.S. average of $13.46 dollars
was almost 10 times Mexico's.
   Low wage costs in other countries have long been used by
politicians as the reason for protecting U.S. industry from
imports. Labor unions also have complained against ``exporting
jobs,'' arguing that low labor costs in other countries encourage
U.S. employers to set up production there rather than at home.
   Labor in the newly-industrialized countries of Asia and Latin
America remained less than a fifth as costly as in the United
States.
   Of 22 countries surveyed, seven had costs higher than the U.S.
rate here. They were, in addition to Norway: Switzerland, $17.06;
West Germany, $16.83; Sweden, $15.14; Netherlands, $15.11 dollars;
Belgium, $15.08 and Denmark $l4.49 dolllars.
   All 23 countries for which the Labor Department had statistics
showed an increase of compensation in their own currency, including
the United States.
   ``Japan's relative cost level in 1987 (of 84 percent of U.S.
costs) greatly exceeded the previous peak of 72 percent reached in
1986,'' said the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   It noted that Japan's level was now close to Canada's. The
increase was due largely to the rise of the yen against the dollar.
   The high value of the domestic currency against the dollar was
also the reason for most of the rise in European costs, though they
were also raised in Norway and Denmark by cuts in working hours,
the report said.

   Here is the text of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's letter to Jesse Jackson, as released Monday by the
Jackson campaign. It was written in response to a March 23 letter
from Jackson. The text, as released by the campaign, contained
several fragmentary sentences, misspellings, and other
irregularities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dear Reverend Jackson:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With sincere emotion, I read your most attentive letter,
addressed to me, dated March 23, delivered by Cirilo McSween, in
which you expressed your moral concern for the political and
economic living conditions of the Panamanian people. Your concern
for the crisis which has provoked great suffering and your appeal
to me to persist in seeking peace and to put an end to this crisis,
you expressed your anxiety to do whatever is possible to help
alleviate the suffering and that we should act immediately.
   Your reputation as a great moral authority obligates me to give
consideration and pay attention to your appeal, so that we may work
together for the peace and unification of my country. In this
sense, I manifest that it has always been one of the objectives of
the Defense Force and mine, to try to keep social peace for the
Panamanian brothers and sisters and the foreigners that reside in
our country. Our doctrine of National Security is inspired in the
ideals of social justice and not of military concepts.
   I am sure that you are aware of the deep internal and external
aspects of the political and economic situation now they have been
destabalizing our consitutional Panamanian institutions so as to
have a country that is weak and ruined, so it becomes an easy prey
for the dictates of foreign forces. I am sure that you know the
details of the amalgam between professional Panamanian politicians
that are now dressed in sheepskin, and the legislative and
executive sectors of the United States of America, who have
translated an open and barefaced intervention into the internal
affairs of Panama, with the final proposition that they do not give
compliment to the covenant of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty of 1977.
No Panamanian with a firm nationalistic and patriotic sentiment
would ever accept that the solution of internal problems of the
Republic of Panama, be dictated from Washington, D.C.
(Consequently, I find it unnecesary to repeat this answer to your
letter with more details in the wheel of the Panamanian crisis.
   There is something that has awakened my curiosity and come to my
attention: How is it possible that the Reagan's Administration who
has publicly made gala of great love for God and have profound
religious sentiment has campaigned terrible economic sanctions that
have been imposed on the Panamanian people, causing the kind of
suffering that you feel sincerely inhuman, causing the threat of
brutal military forces, the sabotage, the psychological war against
a materially small and weak country, but a dignified coungry, just
like Panama is.
   Manuel Solis Palma is the actual Head of State of Panama by
Constitutional decision of the Legislative Assembly; it is
recognized by the Supreme Court of Justice. He has recently called
for a sincere national dialogue between all the sectors of the
Panamanian society, with the purpose of a specific solution for the
Democracy of our country, with up-coming celebration of free and
open elections of May 1989.
   The Defense Forces support this cause by the Panamanian Chief of
State and at the same time, reject any imposition and any political
and economic program that will be dictated from Washington, D.C.
   The word, ``perpetuity'' has been historically imposed on Panama
by the Unied States of America in the different Canal Treaties
since 1903. Nevertheless, I assure you that, those words do not
form a part of my personal vocabulary, nor of my honor in the
military. My duration as Commander and Chief of the Defense Forces
is governed by the Panamanian Constitution and Law of the Defense
Forces.
   You can do a lot to help, by eliminating one of the principal
causes of the suffering of many Panamanians. In other words, the
foreign intervention. You may contribute by your knowledgeable
advice and create by mutual communition, the harmony and the
material peace between all Panamanians, without discrimination of
any class.
   With my deepest respect for you, I shall be at your disposition
to speak with you more deeply about this theme whenever you are
available.
   Attentively,
   
   P.S. I have been lied about! I have been villafied! I have been
humiliated internationally!
   I consider myself to have been persecuted by illegal actions by
so-called justice, by political interests of your nation.
   I, as a Christian, before you, denounce this untrue, because how
is it possible that nation as powerful should employ the services
of journalistic mis-information, the threat of death bdfore one of
God's children, such as I consider to be at the present time in
this struggle?
   This is my testimony, Reverend Jackson, before the Divine and
Eternal Laws of the all-powerful God.
   I feel rich in faith and find my situation in Isaiah 45, with
all humility and reverence.

<HEAD>Wright Adviser Details Effort To Sell Weapons To Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An adviser to House Speaker Jim Wright says he
contacted Oliver North associate Richard Miller nearly two years
ago in a bid to broker a weapons deal for the Contras but did not
know he was tapping into the North private aid network.
   In a deposition taken by congressional Iran-Contra investigators
and released Monday, Richard Pena said that he only met North once
briefly and that Miller ``may have mentioned'' North.
   He said he had a sense that Miller, a public relations man with
ties to the Contras, might be able to get a weapons offer to them
and so Pena asked him about the possibility in the spring of 1986.
   Wright, a Texas Democrat and longstanding opponent of U.S.
military aid to the Contras, has said he had no idea his friend and
adviser was trying to sell them weapons.
   Pena, a former Foreign Affairs Committee staff member, has
traveled to Central America as Wright's observer and emissary in
the evolving peace process between the U.S.-backed Contras and the
leftist Nicaraguan government.
   North is charged in the Iran-Contra affair on a variety of
counts stemming from his clandestine operation to supply the
Contras. Miller named North as a co-conspirator when Miller pleaded
guilty to illegally using a tax-exempt foundation for the
non-exempt purpose of raising money to arm the Contras.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., the vice chairman of the House
Iran-Contra investigating committee, said last week that he does
not recall if the committee staff ever told him about Pena's
connection or that Pena had given a deposition. Pena was not called
as a witness by the committee.
   At the time of the contact with Miller, the House had approved
$100 million in new aid for the rebels after a cutoff that had left
the Contras supplied only through North's secret operation.
   Pena was trying to see that some of that money be used to
purchase items such as grenades and bombs from a Chilean arms
manufacturer.
   Pena told the investigators he knew only that Miller had a
public relations involvement with the rebels, but he sensed there
was ``something there'' that could lead to an arms deal.
   Investigators asked him why he would go to the head of a
Washington public relations firm rather than just dealing directly
with the Contras from the start.
   ``He seemed to have had a very good working relationship with
them,'' Pena said. ``He told me that he would talk to the right
people in the administration.''
   But Pena subsequently took the arms proposal directly to the
Contras, according to documents referred to in his deposition. He
gave Contra official Bosco Matamoros a list of weapons available
from the Chilean company, Industrias Cardoen, on Aug. 12, 1986.
   On Aug. 15, Pena wrote a letter to a front company in the Cayman
Islands that Miller had set up to handle his Contra transactons
with North, and to which he had told Pena to address the proposal.
   Pena included the weapons list with his letter.
   ``I passed it on to Col. North,'' Miller said in his deposition.
``Mr. Pena asked me to pass it on to whoever the appropriate person
was.''
   Pena said nothing ever came of the offer.
   Asked if he had any personal contact with North, Pena said he
had met him many years ago at an Organization of American States
reception.
   Pena, who works for a Washington public relations firm, has not
returned several messages left at his office in the past 11 days.

<TEXT>
   A power fluctuation caused lights to
flicker and dim Monday in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and parts of
South Dakota, and was blamed for a minor radioactive gas leak,
officials said.
   Dennis Eyre, administrative manager for the Western Systems
Coordinating Council based here, said utility employees in the
affected states were working to discover the cause.
   In portions of Wyoming, power went completely out for a brief
period, but in most of the affected areas power levels were only
reduced, he said.
   The trouble occurred at 2:18 p.m. MDT, he said. There were no
reports of serious problems resulting from the power dips, he said.
   Colorado officials said the fluctuation caused a radioactive gas
leak and temporarily closed the Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating
Station near Platteville.
   Mark Severts, spokesman for Public Service Co. of Colorado in
Denver, said the leak posed no danger to the public or plant
workers. He said it was less than one-thousandth of the
concentration the utility is authorized to release on a scheduled
basis.
   In Wyoming, Rick Kaysen, customer service manager for Cheyenne
Light, Fuel and Power Co., attributed the fluctuation to problems
at a Grizzly, Ore., substation that idled three generating stations
in Colorado.
   Eyre said he had heard nothing about the Oregon substation.
   ``There is a lot of speculation going around. We'd rather not
speculate,'' Eyre said.
   The Western Systems Coordinating Council is one of nine regional
councils that coordinate power distribution in the United States
and parts of Canada and Mexico. The regional councils were created
after a 1965 East Coast power outage.

<HEAD>Split Decision In Minnesota Likely For Jackson, Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson and Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis are virtually tied in the race for delegates from
Minnesota, where a plurality of state convention delegates have
moved into the uncommitted column.
   Dukakis, whose campaign estimated last month that he would win
more than twice as many national convention delegates as Jackson in
Minnesota, was clinging to a one-vote lead among delegates elected
to the state convention.
   With returns from county conventions, accounting for 75 percent
of the 1,262 delegates elected to the state convention, Dukakis was
supported by 219 while Jackson had 218 and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon
had 78. Another 423 state convention delegates were uncommitted.
   If these results held up at the state and congressional district
conventions, where Minnesota Democrats pick 78 of their national
convention delegates in May and June, Jackson would win 19 national
delegates, Dukakis would receive 18, Simon would gain one and 40
would be uncommitted.
   ``I don't know if anything has really happened,'' said Tad
Devine, who oversees national delegate selection for the Dukakis
campaign. ``I've always viewed this as an evolving process.
   ``We view this as a very active delegate-selection process, and
we'll be trying in the weeks ahead to win as many delegates as we
can from Minnesota,'' he said in a telephone interview from Boston.
   Minnesotans began their delegate-selection process on Feb. 23
with precinct caucuses but because of a conflict with national
party rules, the results of those caucuses were never clearly
reported.
   Minnesota Secretary of State Joan Growe tried to produce a count
on caucus night, but the results were incomplete and in some places
were tallied incorrectly.
   The state party itself tried to produce a count two weeks later
based on a paper ballot filled out at the caucuses, but so many of
the ballots were disallowed that those results too became
unreliable.
   Based on Growe's results, the Dukakis campaign earlier had
projected that Dukakis would end up with 27 of the 78 Minnesota
National Convention delegates that are elected through the process
that begins with the precinct caucuses. According to the Dukakis
campaign's initial tally, Jackson and Simon would have received 13
delegates each, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt would have received
one, and 24 delegates would have been uncommitted.
   The Dukakis campaign shut down its campaign office in Minnesota
following the precinct caucuses. Devine said Dukakis campaign
workers will be returning to Minnesota after the Tuesday's primary
in Wisconsin.
   ``Our plans are, as soon as we're through with Wisconsin, a
number of people working there will be freed up to work on our
efforts in Minnesota, and I expect we will put a lot of effort into
that state,'' he said.
   ``In terms of the effort we would like to make there, it's most
effective to work in the latter stages of the caucus process, in
terms of getting out your supporters,'' Devine said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Bush Defeat Could Hand Dole New Platform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Vice President George Bush stumbles on his
way to the White House this November, erstwhile rival Bob Dole
could wind up as the nation's top GOP spokesman.
   The Senate minority leader under a Democratic administration
could find himself playing the lead in a 1980s version of the 1960s
Ev and Charlie Show.
   It might well be called the Bob and Bob show, with Dole being
joined by House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois to counter a
Democratic president's programs and present alternatives to them.
   The Ev of Ev and Charlie was Senate Minority leader Everett
McKinley Dirksen of Illinois.
   Dirksen teamed with House Minority Leader Charles Halleck of
Indiana in a regular series of televised news conferences, Dirksen
became the undisputed ``Mr. Republican'' of his era.
   Dole, crowded out of the 1988 Republican field by Bush, has
returned to his leadership position in the Senate, serving notice
he intends to prod the GOP into opening its arms to a wider
constituency.
   Republicans should, Dole says, address issues of concern to the
homeless and the poor and embrace programs to deal with narcotics,
day care, education, long-term health care, Medicaid and Medicare.
   ``We must, above all, give more Americans a reason to come our
way and at the same time strengthen the commitment of our
staunchest supporters,'' Dole said last week.
   With a sense of humor that can be dark and biting, Dole will
have his own distinct style and image if he emerges as national
spokesman for the GOP.
   Dirksen was ``full of fun and thunder,'' said Dirksen biographer
Neil McNeil.
   McNeil, in his 1970 ``Dirksen: Portrait of a Public Man,'' said
the Senate minority leader became a television superstar despite a
complete lack of the veneer said to be essential to a politician in
the age of television.
   ``His tousled hair, long his trademark, was an easily
recognizable ensign,'' McNeil wrote. ``His deep-throated husky
voice, his flamboyant manners and his often astonishing use of a
rococo vocabulary all tickled the viewing millions.''
   Washington Post cartoonist Herblock caricatured Dirksen as a
melancholy clown, Halleck as a buffoon and straight man.
   Halleck resented the Ev and Charlie tag. He took his
partisanship seriously.
   But Dirksen said he liked the name, said it reminded him of such
other all-American duos as corned beef and cabbage and ham and eggs.
   Some Republicans said they thought the two stood in poor
contrast to John F. Kennedy, the nation's new, youthful and
handsome Democratic president.
   One complained about Dirksen's ``fuzzy hair'' and Halleck's
``big red nose.''
   ``None of this troubled Dirksen,'' McNeil wrote, ``for even as
the criticisms were being made, he and Halleck were getting
television and press coverage to make the opposition's case against
the Kennedy administration. In time, he sensed, the criticism would
wane and he would be better off for the national notoriety he was
now receiving.''
   Dirksen and Halleck used the Ev and Charlie routine to showcase
criticism of the Kennedy domestic program.
   ``It may be called the New Frontier, but the Kennedy program is
the old New Deal taken out of an old warming oven,'' Dirksen said.
   He scored the administration for ``deficit spending, increased
government controls, increases in the government payroll, more
welfare statism and that inevitable price which we must pay the
piper, more taxes.''
   By mid 1962 the Ev and Charlie show was fully launched and
obviously effective in stating the Republican case. The ridicule
evaporated.
   No Republican leader since has had anything quite resembling his
disheveled flair, rumpled charm and widespread appeal.

<TEXT>
   Panama's political crisis, with
its uncertainties and hardships, has prompted concern among the
more than 1,100 Americans and their families who still live in the
former Panama Canal Zone.
   The artificially high quality of life the zone afforded
Americans for more than 60 years before it was returned to Panama
in 1979 has changed, and there are fears that Americans could be
casualties of the political turmoil.
   About 1,300 American troops are to arrive this week to protect
the 10,000 soldiers assigned to watch the Panama Canal and to guard
American lives and property.
   But that does not convince all the Americans in the zone that
they are secure. ``The (U.S.) army is for the army,'' said Ann
Fahren, the wife of a Panama Canal ship pilot who has lived in
Panama 10 years.
   During the worst days of the recent crisis, she said, she was
refused permission to shop at U.S. military-run grocery stores even
after the military advised against going into the city to shop
because of protests and riots.
   ``It burns me up,'' she said. ``The army should not have slammed
its doors in our face.''
   When the Panama Canal Zone existed, it had its own police force,
courts, clubs, schools, stores and even postage stamps. The 10-mile
strip that ran the width of Panama was a self-contained, subsidized
enclave whose residents could forget they were in Panama. Legally,
they were not.
   The zone was turned over to Panama in 1979 as part of the 1977
treaties that transfer control of the canal to Panama at the end of
this century.
   The zone is now feeling the problems of one of the region's more
unstable countries. Since June, Panama has been rocked by
sometimes-violent protests as opposition groups pushed for the
ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, as head of the 15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces,
is the power behind the civilian government. He is under indictment
in the United States on federal drug trafficking charges.
   Panama's banks have been closed since March 3, creating a
critical cash shortage. The United States has frozen Panamanian
money held in U.S. banks and imposed other economic sanctions.
   The unguarded entrance to the canal zone is across a boulevard
from one of Panama City's toughest neighborhoods, which is filled
with old barracks used in some cases to house workers who built the
canal for the United States from 1904 to 1914.
   Street gangs occasionally enter the area, something unheard of
in the old days.
   ``It's the lull before the storm,'' said Mrs. Fahren. ``We used
to go out to the beach, everywhere. Now you don't even see people
out on the streets.''
   Some residents are third-generation Zonians, as long-term
residents are known, but they are getting fewer and some zone
residents talk now of sending families back to the United States.
   ``I have a daughter who will go to Florida State University this
fall,'' said Jim Kaufman, deputy branch agent for the Panama Canal
Pilots Association, the organization of pilots who guide ships
through the canal.
   ``She is scheduled to come back but I may not bring her back,''
said Kaufman, who has lived in Panama 20 years.
   ``I have a boy in the 11th grade and I'm looking for a place for
him to stay in the States,'' he said. ``Even if Gen. Noriega goes
tomorrow, how long will it be before things are normal again here?''
   Several residents said they were worried that the Panamanian
Defense Forces are responsible for their security.
   ``What I see as the worse scenario _ the worst possible scenario
_ is that the United States will keep the pressure up and back
Noriega into a corner and he will grab four or five (Americans) as
hostages,'' said Norm Dixon, also a canal ship pilot who already
has sent his family back to Florida.
   He is one of 120 of the canal's 230 pilots who works on a
six-four plan under which he works six weeks straight and has four
weeks off.
   There is a waiting list to get six-four status, Kaufman said,
mostly because of pilots who want to send their families out and be
with them for a month every six weeks. ``A lot wanted to do so
before all of this started. Now they really want to do it,'' he
said.
   The number of Americans in the old zone has been reduced by
about half since the treaties were negotiated. The Americans either
work for the canal or the U.S. Defense Department.
   Some left the zone before the treaties were signed by former
President Jimmy Carter and the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, said John
Maher, president of the Pilots Association. Others stayed, hoping
the treaties would not be ratified, then left when they were.
   The third exodus, he said, came in 1983 when Panama assumed
control of police functions in the former zone.

   Movie star Kevin Bacon plans to marry
blue-blooded actress Kyra Minturn Sedgwick in September, says a
spokesman for the actor.
   Publicist Allen Eichhorn made the announcement Monday.
   Miss Sedgwick has been rehearsing with Jason Robards and Colleen
Dewhurst in a production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Ah, Wilderness!''
opening today in New Haven, Conn.
   Bacon's screen credits include ``Footloose,'' ``Quicksilver''
and the recent films ``She's Having a Baby'' and ``End of the
Line.'' He has also appeared on stage and television.
   Miss Sedgwick is the daughter of Patricia Heller of New York, an
educational and family therapist, and Henry D. Sedgwick of New York
and Stockbridge, Mass., a venture capitalist. Her
great-grandfather, Endicott Peabody, founded the Groton School.
   Bacon's father, Edmund, is former director of the Philadelphia
City Planning Commission. His mother, Ruth, teaches preschool
children.

   It's taken most of her 68 years, but
entertainer-businesswoman Eva Gabor says she has finally learned to
live alone without fretting.
   ``The last five years is the first time I'm not married in my
life, and I've found my center _ a sense of self-responsibility,''
said Gabor, who is promoting her upcoming autobiography, to be
published by Little-Brown.
   Gabor, the younger sister of actress Zsa Zsa Gabor and the
former co-star of the television series ``Green Acres,'' has been
married five times.
   ``I enjoy, really enjoy, living alone, which is strange for a
lady who was the clinging vine of all times,'' she said recently.
``I became a grown-up being, an idea I always fought, and have
discovered that it's better to live alone and be at peace with
yourself than to be married and to be under continuous stress.''
   Besides running her 16-year-old, international wig business and
tending her garden at home in Los Angeles, Gabor works for AIDS
patients and cancer victims.
   ``To die with AIDS is to die without dignity,'' she said. ``I've
seen it in my hospice work. You are treated like a leper. To me
it's worse than cancer, because cancer nurses don't come into your
room with masks and gloves.''

   The organizer of an auction for a local
ballet school says she's been overwhelmed by donations from more
than 100 stars, including a pair of red dancing shoes from Liza
Minnelli and a compact mirror from Ginger Rogers.
   ``Things are still coming in,'' Ellen Ricciardi, director of the
auction to benefit the Central Wisconsin School of Ballet, said
Monday. ``I have been totally surpised ... It's neat for little
Wausau to get items like that.''
   Proceeds from the auction scheduled April 23 will help pay for
educational programs and performances, Mrs. Ricciardi told The
Wausau Daily Herald. Between 100 and 200 students from preschool
through high school attend the school in this central Wisconsin
city, she said.
   She said other items include a signed copy of a
``M-A-S-H''television script from star Alan Alda and a pewter mug

   Jessica McClure, the 2-year-old rescued last October after
spending 58 hours in an abandoned well, and Olympic gold medalist
Bonnie Blair were among the newer celebrities who threw out the
first pitches of the baseball season.
   In Arlington, Texas, Jessica bounced a one-hopper into the mitt
of Texas catcher Geno Petralli from a distance of 3 feet before the
Rangers' Monday night home game against Cleveland.
   To prove it was no accident, she did it twice to the roars and
applause of the Arlington Stadium crowd, who saw the Rangers defeat
Cleveland 4-3.
   Blair, who won the gold in the 500-meter speed skating event at
the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Canada, threw the first pitch in
the opener between the California Angels and the Chicago White Sox.
   The 23-year-old from Champaign, Ill., may have brought the local
team luck. The White Sox beat the Angels 8-5.

   With his ouster, Evan Mecham joined a
short but ignominious list of convicted governors, among them a
chief executive whoused the National Guard to surround his Capitol
and one who declared martial law.
   Monday's vote by the state Senate to sustain the two articles of
impeachment made Mecham the first U.S. governor to be impeached and
removed from office in 59 years.
   Legal scholars say impeachment was devised in England, where
Parliament used it as a way to flex its muscle against kings and
ministers. Impeachment was brought to America in colonial days as a
way to protect democracy.
   ``It's basically, `You're fired.' Impeachment is a way to get
out of office those officials that violate the public trust,'' said
University of Arizona law professor Robert Glennon.
   Had he been acquitted, Mecham would have joined the likes of
Thomas Jefferson and Huey Long, the flamboyant ``Kingfish'' of
Louisiana, among governors who were impeached by legislators but
not convicted.
   Instead, he became one of seven chief executives who have been
removed from office, including the first governor of Nebraska and a
pair of governors in Oklahoma.
   Gov. David Butler of Nebraska was removed in 1871 for
misappropriating school funds, but the impeachment proceedings
subsequently were expunged from the legislative record and in 1888
he was elected to another term as governor.
   Gov. John C. Walton of Oklahoma was removed in 1923 after he
declared martial law and ordered the National Guard to disband a
grand jury that was investigating him.
   Gov. Henry S. Johnston, also of Oklahoma, used equally strong
tactics to try to prevent an investigation of him. Johnston ordered
the National Guard to surround the Capitol to prevent the
Legislature from assembling to conduct the probe. Johnston, who was
removed in 1929, was the last governor ousted from office by
legislators before Mecham.
   Also on the list is Gov. William W. Holden of North Carolina,
who was removed in 1871 after he unconstitutionally suspended the
right of habeas corpus and sent militia to quell violence by the Ku
Klux Klan, which was accused of murders aimed at frightening blacks
into not voting.
   In Arizona, the governor need only commit ``high crimes,
misdemeanors, or malfeasance'' to face impeachment. Mecham,
convicted of obstruction of justice and misusing funds, is the
first Arizona governor to be impeached.
   Jefferson was impeached by Virginia' colonial Assembly in 1781.
Among the charges was that he had fled with unseemly haste when
British troops attacked the capital. Although the Assembly soon
backed down, Jefferson insisted on a trial and won vindication.
   Long was impeached on charges of misusing state funds in 1929.
The case was dropped when 15 senators _ enough to block conviction
_ announced their support for the governor.

   Two jet warplane crashes near
West German nuclear power plants have increased criticism of NATO
pilot-training practices, and one newspaper's coverage of the issue
has angered the U.S. Air Force.
   Tens of thousands of West German protesters joined traditional
Easter peace marches and vigils that began Saturday and lasted
through Monday.
   This year the demonstrators not only called for scrapping
nuclear arms, but they also protested the two air crashes that
occurred near atomic power plants just over 24 hours of each other
last week.
   The Association for General Aviation, a West German organization
of private pilots, joined the protesters in demanding that NATO
keep its warplanes away from nuclear power plants.
   ``The chance of the Chernobyl nuclear accident was more than
likely very slim, but it happened anyway,'' Michael Schultz,
spokesman for the group, pointed out in a radio interview.
   The respected Wickert Institute polled West Germans and found
that 15 percent want NATO to halt its low-level military training
flights over this nation. Two-thirds of the 1,710 people polled
said such flights were necessary but the number should be reduced,
the Tuebingen-based institute said Saturday.
   A French Mirage jet fighter crashed on March 30 one mile from a
nuclear power plant in the southern state of Bavaria, killing the
pilot.
   ``We escaped the worst imaginable accident by only a
split-second,'' Herbert Weinzierl, head of the Bavarian Federation
for Nature Protection, said after the crash.
   One day later, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed in the
southern town of Forst, demolishing three houses and killing a
resident and the pilot. The accident occurred nine miles east of
another nuclear power plant.
   Federal officials say nuclear power plants are sufficiently
protected from even a direct hit by falling warplanes, but
protesters say such assurances are based only on theory.
   West German newspapers have given intense coverage to the debate
of the possible threat from jet warplane crashes.
   On Sunday, the mass-circulation Bild am Sonntag newspaper
printed a front-page article headlined ``This Junk Flies Over Our
Heads,'' accompanied by what it said was pictures of a patched-up
U.S. Air Force F-16.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified U.S. employee at Sembach
Air Base, located near the southwest city of Kaiserslautern, as
saying poor maintenance and a shortage of spare parts made U.S.
F-16 planes unsafe.
   The report said 110,000 low-level military practice flights were
conducted over West Germany annually by seven NATO-member air
forces, including the United States.
   A U.S. Air Force spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said U.S. military officials were upset over what he described as
Bild's ``highly inaccurate report.'' He said he could not verify
how many low-level flights were made over West Germany.
   The spokesman said the Americans would coordinate a response to
the Bild article because the United States is but one of several
countries involved in low-level training flights here. He declined
to elaborate.
   Other NATO nations that regularly train in West Germany airspace
include Canada, France, the Netherlands, Britain, West Germany and
Norway.
   Another spokesman told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from U.S. Air Force European headquarters at Ramstein Air
Base that the photograph in Bild was not of an F-16.
   ``The Bild picture shows a non-operational F-4 which has been
parked near the (perimeter) fence on Sembach for some time,'' said
spokesman Douglas Moore.
   ``It's not an F-16 and doesn't even have a motor. It's only used
by technicians to practice fuselage-patching so they will be
proficient in getting a damaged airplane back in the air in
wartime,'' Moore said.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and the Democratic Party
establishment are holding their breath today while Wisconsin votes.
   Not to mention New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and the
scenario-spinners who are watching the Democratic drama play itself
out.
   In his wildest dreams, Dukakis probably never imagined that he'd
be engaged in a state-by-state duel with Jesse Jackson for the
nomination. Or running neck-and-neck with his black rival in a
state that is 96 percent white and may have a profound influence
over the winner of the Democratic presidential marathon.
   A victory would restore some of the luster that Dukakis gained
with his Super Tuesday wins last month in Florida, Texas, Maryland
and elsewhere. A defeat would compound stinging losses in Illinois
and Michigan and raise serious new questions about the
Massachusetts governor's ability to compete.
   A Dukakis defeat would almost certainly lead to another round of
Cuomo-drafting scenarios in the two weeks before the New York
primary. For all the talk of rallying around the candidate with the
most delegates, enough Democratic Party leaders are worried about a
Jackson-led party debacle this fall to make some sort of draft
movement extremely likely if Dukakis falters.
   For Jackson, a victory would make him the leading contender in
the nomination fight, in fact if not in delegate totals. A defeat
might suggest that his remarkable campaign has peaked _ just as he
moves into the delegate-rich states of New York, Pennsylvania and
Ohio over the next month.
   For Sen. Albert Gore, a victory would be miraculous. The result
forecast by the polls _ third place _ would be another devastating
finish to an expensive effort. And already Dukakis' aides are
seeking to undermine Gore's New York campaign.
   The fourth man in the race, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, would
settle for survival.
   Dukakis, the marathoner, told reporters on Monday, ``I don't
have to win'' in Wisconsin. ``I just have to win a good plurality
of delegates by June 9,'' the day the primary season ends.
   His aides were doing their best to cushion the impact of a
possible defeat, as well, although Tom Loftus, speaker of the
Wisconsin House of Representatives, told reporters, ``I think
Dukakis is going to win by enough _ 3, 4, 5 points.''
   Even before the polls opened today in Wisconsin for the state's
Democratic presidential primary, Dukakis' aides were explaining why
their man might lose in this industrial state to Jackson, as he did
in Michigan 10 days ago and in Illinois before that.
   The Illinois loss was the result of facing two favorite sons at
the same time, Jackson and Simon, the governor's aides argued. The
Michigan loss was the result of a primary-caucus hybrid and a large
black vote in Detroit that played into Jackson's hands, they added.
   Wisconsin allows crossover votes, meaning that mischievous
Republicans could vote for the Democrat who now appears to be least
likely to beat George Bush in November _ Jackson.
   So has it gone with the Dukakis campaign in recent weeks: trying
to explain the last big-state loss while hoping to lower public
expectations about the contest just ahead. All the while, Dukakis
is hoping that the Jackson tide will crest before it engulfs him.
   Dukakis took advantage of his Connecticut primary victory and a
full week of campaigning in Wisconsin to retool his campaign. He
talked gingerly of differences between himself and Jackson, served
lunch to senior citizens and visited hospitalized children in an
attempt to shed his image as an aloof technocrat. He unveiled a new
speech designed to appeal to blue-collar voters.
   All that simply raised the stakes for him in the state.
   By whatever reckoning, a loss in Wisconsin would leave Dukakis
winless in the first three Midwestern industrial states, and raise
fresh questions about whether he has the ability to gain the type
of blue-collar support needed to produce a Democratic victory in
November.
   From there, it's only a short hop to Cuomo, the governor of New
York who has flirted all year with the Democratic Party and whose
state holds the next primary in two weeks. A Dukakis victory in
Wisconsin would mean Cuomo could only stay on the sidelines,
possibly deciding to embrace the Massachusetts governor before New
Yorkers vote. A Jackson victory in Wisconsin and the draft-Cuomo
movement will take on new urgency.
   Forget about Simon. Barring a miracle in Wisconsin, his
candidacy is over.
   What about Gore? Going into Wisconsin, he had performed
abysmally since his Super Tuesday successes on March 8. So poorly,
in fact, that he is in debt and ineligible for federal campaign
matching funds. He poured money into Wisconsin, in hopes of gaining
the 20 percent of the vote needed to requalify.

   Britons are such avid gardeners they even find
time for the hobby on an oil rig in the storm-tossed North Sea.
   Workers on the U.S.-owned Chevron Petroleum platform are growing
melons, oranges, herbs, vegetables and decorative pot plants in a
greenhouse, 100 miles off the Shetland Islands northeast of
Scotland.
   The 10-foot by 8-foot glass and aluminium greenhouse is bolted
to the deck and heated by electricity from the rig's
turbine-generators which run on natural gas pumped up from the
seabed.
   Pests which bother land-based gardeners are unknown at sea in
the northern latitude, reported London's Daily Mail newspaper
Tuesday, beside a picture of the little greenhouse above the waves

   The U.S. dollar, which fell briefly to a
three-month low against the Japanese yen Monday, regained some of
its strength Tuesday in Tokyo, while stock prices dipped slightly.
   The dollar closed at 124.43 yen, up 0.58 yen from Monday's close
of 123.85 yen. It had opened the day at 124.38 yen and traded
between 124.30-124.75 yen. On Monday, the dollar opened at at
123.70 yen, its lowest opening level since Jan. 5 when it started
trading at 123 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 53.17 points Monday, shed 19.94
points, ending the day at 26,315.35.
   ``Institutional investors and life insurance companies who had
been selling the dollar have turned to buying,'' said a dealer at a
major commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said an apparent sentiment among investors that the dollar
would no longer decline had made participants ``adjust their
positions.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
issues, up 53.17 points on Monday, slipped 45.08 points, to close
the morning session at 26,290.21.
   Hiromi Yoneyama of Wako Securities said there was strong buying
sentiment in the stock market, despite the drop in the key Nikkei
indicator.
   ``Profit-taking of steel and shipbuilding issues brought the
stock average down,'' Yoneyama said. ``But the market appears to be
in a positive mood prompted by the stronger dollar.''

   Education authorities today promised to conduct an
inquiry into an accident in the Austrian Alps that killed four
British schoolboys.
   The boys slid to their deaths over a precipice while walking on
a 6,500-foot mountain near Untersberg in the Salzburg district on
Monday. Two other schoolboys saved themselves by clinging to a tree.
   The six, from Altwood School in Maidenhead near London, were in
a group of 45 on a two-week sightseeing trip of Europe. They were
supervised by four teachers.
   Police said the boys got left behind by the main party. Brian
Lee, one of the supervisors, said in a radio interview that six
strayed from a path.
   Austrian police identified the dead boys as Andrew Powell-Lee,
15, Andrew Watts, 14, Michael Taylor, 13, and Daniel Howton, 14.
   Graham Williams, deputy director of education for Berkshire
county where Maidenhead is located, said the inquiry would begin
with the school being asked for a full report.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Vote Tuesday May Top 1.5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A four-way Democratic presidential primary
plus hotly contested local elections and race track referendums
were expected to lure 1.5 million voters to the Wisconsin polls
today, election officials said.
   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, front-runners in delegate
count for the Democratic nomination, were each seeking to gain
momentum with a victory, while Sens. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and
Paul Simon, D-Ill., were hoping for significant boosts for their
candidacies.
   With Vice President George Bush a virtual shoo-in for the
Republican nomination, leaders of both parties talked of possible
defections to the Democratic column.
   Wisconsin's open primary law permits voters, regardless of
party, to vote for the candidates of their choice, creating what
some call ``mischief'' voting.
   A tight mayoral race in Milwaukee for the right to succeed Henry
Maier, retiring after 28 years in office, figured to boost the
voter turnout in the state's largest city.
   An estimated 1,591,000, or 45 percent of the state's 3,536,000
eligible voters, were expected to go to the polls, the State
Elections board said.

   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum isn't spurning talk
that she could be George Bush's vice presidential running mate _
but she's also not taking it too seriously.
   ``You know, there are going to be 500 (possible) tickets between
now and August,'' the Kansas Republican said in a Washington
interview with The Kansas City Star.
   ``Part of the game will be for (Bush) to keep throwing out a lot
of names and speculation on who will be the vice presidential
nominee. That's the only game in town right now,'' she said. ``It's
presumptuous to think you'd even be asked.''
   Mrs. Kassebaum, who is in Japan this week, was suggested for the
vice presidential race eight years ago by Sen. S.I. Hayakawa of
California to heal rifts in the GOP on the abortion and the Equal
Rights Amendment issues. She said at the time that she did not have
the necessary experience and rejected the idea.
   ``My staff keeps saying, `Don't say no,''' she told the Star.
And she has followed their advice.
   Campaign aides to Vice President Bush, the front-runner in the
Republican presidential nomination, say they are not developing a

<HEAD>Draft-Cuomo Group Sues for Place on Calif. Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of Mario Cuomo are suing in an
attempt to force elections officials to place the New York
governor's name on California's June 7 Democratic presidential
primary ballot.
   The suit, filed Monday, against Secretary of State March Fong Eu
by the Draft Cuomo for President Committee was scheduled for a
hearing Friday before Presiding Judge Cecily Bond of the Sacramento
County Superior Court.
   Eu has refused to list Cuomo among ``generally recognized''
candidates who are automatically placed on California's
presidential ballot because he has stated publicly he is not a
candidate. And she rejected the draft Cuomo committee petitions
last week on grounds they didn't contain enough voter signatures or
meet other requirements.
   Attorney Gerald Hill, state co-chairman of the draft Cuomo
committee, said his group is acting completely independent of Cuomo
``as a true draft effort.''
   Hill said his suit challenges the constitutionality of the state
law Eu cited in rejecting his draft petitions, which he said
contained the signatures of an estimated 17,000 to 20,000
California voters.
   Eu's office said she would have no comment on the suit until it
is thoroughly reviewed, but that she stood by her rejection of the
Cuomo petitions, which not only didn't contain the required number
of signatures, but also didn't come, as specified in the law, from
a group authorized by Cuomo.

<HEAD>Democratic Presidential Hopefuls Put Safety First on Shoreham
Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential hopefuls Jesse Jackson
and Sen. Paul Simon oppose opening the Shoreham nuclear power plant
on Long Island, while Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore would support legislation to allow a
federal agency to determine whether the area around the plant could
be evacuated safely, according to New York Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan.
   Moynihan said Monday he learned the candidates' positions
regarding the plant in their responses to a letter dated March 31
in which he asked each his position on legislation he had
introduced.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said Long Island
could not be safely evacuated without the cooperation of state and
local officials, who have refused to participate in such planning.
However, in a controversial flip-flop, the NRC changed its own
rules last year to allow the commission to assume that state and
local officials would cooperate during an actual nuclear emergency.
   Moynihan introduced legislation last year to require the NRC to
abide by FEMA's decision. The bill was defeated in committee.

<DATELINE>WISCONSIN RAPIDS, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender
Albert Gore Jr. predicted he would get a boost in today's Wisconsin
primary from the undecided vote swinging his way.
   Public opinion surveys showed Gore and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon
trailing Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson of
Chicago in the primary, in which 81 Democratic delegates are at
stake.
   But Gore predicted he will get a bigger share of the Wisconsin
vote than polls indicated.
   ``It's now clear to me, after the conversations with voters of
the last few days, and on the basis of the telephone calls to
undecided voters ... that the undecided vote here in Wisconsin is
shifting decisively in our favor,'' he said.
   Gore, who did well in last month's Super Tuesday contests, is in
need of a Northern win. And a victory here would give him a boost
going into the New York primary on April 19.
   Gore trailed far behind the two front-runners in Monday's
Colorado caucuses.
   Speaking to supporters Monday in this community troubled by
business shutdowns and layoffs, Gore said corporations must be
encouraged to invest their profits in expansion that creates jobs,
and that an employer should be required to give adequate notice to
his workers when planning to close shop.
   ``I was an original co-sponsor of the legislation to require a
different approach to plant closings, to have notification of plant
closings and projected layoffs,'' Gore said.
   ``This would give working men and women an opportunity to make
other plans and to get job training, and would also provide them
the opportunity to work with management to try to salvage a plant
before it closes,'' he said.
   A day earlier, Gore said Dukakis has been ``absolutely timid''
about criticizing Jackson.
   ``Michael Dukakis gives the impression of being scared to death
... That is the opposite of the bold leadership,'' Gore said as he
campaigned in Wisconsin.
   The Tennessee senator criticized both rivals for their lack of
experience in national affairs.
   Neither Dukakis nor Jackson ``has had as much as a single day in
national government'' to prepare themselves for the presidency,
Gore said.
   Gore said it was likely the Democratic National Convention would
meet in Atlanta with no candidate possessing enough delegate
strength to win the nomination.
   ``It likely will go more than one ballot,'' he said. ``It's
going to be a long, hard contest.''

<TEXT>
   Some Mecham supporters just shook their
heads in disbelief, others cried, and one victorious opponent said
she was ``heartsick.'' But through it all Evan Mecham sat
stone-faced as his governorship was taken from him.
   ``It should have been close. I don't know what happened,'' said
Millie Pratt, who had joined a knot of formerly festive supporters
before Monday night's Senate vote singing and chanting outside the
Capitol.
   ``I feel betrayed by our Legislature. I had more faith in them.''
   A few supporters cried outside the Senate chambers as the voting
was heard on portable televisions and radios. Some booed and vowed
to oust those voting against Mecham next November. Others just
shook their heads in disbelief.
   Inside, Mecham sat at the defense table between lawyers and
showed virtually no emotion as the vote removing him from office
was tallied, 21-9 on the charge of obstructing justice, 24-6 on the
charge of misusing funds.
   ``Well, they don't like my politics so we finished a political
trial; it's as simple as that,'' Mecham told reporters smiling
broadly in the hallway before a quick departure from the Capitol.
   Mecham wasn't required to attend the vote, and his attorney,
Jerris Leonard, said earlier he had advised him to stay away. The
governor listened as senators explained their votes, some
castigating the first-term Republican as a liar and accusing him of
misusing power.
   As Mecham sat at the defense table, Leonard said he gave him
``the impression that he was almost resigned to the fact that he
knew it was coming.''
   Mecham became the first U.S. governor to be impeached and
removed from office in nearly six decades.
   ``There's no joy in anyone's hearts today,'' said Democrat Lela
Alston, who voted to convict on both counts. ``I'm heartsick.''
   A small number outside cheered the conviction, but most of the
200 or so assembled came to support the ousted governor. They sang
``God Bless America'' after the verdict, and cheered Mecham as he
departed and offered a brief wave to the crowd.
   ``It's no surprise,'' said Andy Cosentino. ``It's a kangaroo
court.''
   Many in the crowd listened to the proceedings on a sound system
used by a country 'n' western band to entertain protesters. The
festivities even included a homegrown version of the ditty
``Elvira'' _ ``Ev Meeecham.''
   The loudest cheer of the day came when the Senate declined to
invoke the ``Dracula clause'' _ a measure that would have barred
Mecham from holding future office in Arizona.
   Earlier, some 300 Mecham supporters staged an 11th hour protest
and mock funeral for the Arizona Constitution, complete with
trumpters playing ``Taps'' and pallbearers toting a black wooden
coffin.
   It turned out to be a burial for Mecham's administration.
   Some wore railroad attire and blew a train-like whistle, and
paper railroad tracks were laid across the plaza because, Mecham
supporters said, the embattled chief executive was being railroaded
by the Legislature. A ``Thank Heaven For Evan'' sign was taped to
the building.
   The anti-Mecham group included Barry Gabriel, who carried a sign
saying simply ``Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.''
   ``I'm very happy and relieved. I think he's a menace, and I
think he's clearly guilty of malfeasance,'' said Gabriel, who took
time out during the voting to snap a few pictures of the crowd and
the reporters assembled outside.
   ``This is history,'' he said. ``Nothing like this will ever
happen again.''

   A 9-year-old California boy has been
recognized by the National Aeronautics Association as the world's
youngest pilot.
   ``Tony (Aliengena) is representative of the renewed interest of
young people in aviation,'' said NAA Vice President Milt Brown.
   ``The number of youngsters actually flying has risen
dramatically over the past few years. And Tony is one of four
individuals under the age of 16 to set records recently.''
   Brown gave Tony his certificate at the National Air and Space
Museum Monday afternoon.
   The San Juan Capitstrano boy became the youngest pilot Saturday
when he completed his transcontinental journey by landing his
father's Cessna at Hanscom Air Field in Bedford, Mass., breaking
the record set last August by 10-year-old Christopher Lee Marshall
of Oceano, Calif, officials said.
   Tony, who is known as ``Buzz,'' became the youngest pilot to fly
solo on March 13, when he flew an ultralight for a minute and 45
seconds at age 9 years 295 days. He broke the record for the
youngest pilot set by Cody A. Locke, who flew on Feb. 23, 1983 at
age 9 years 316 days.

<HEAD>Many Imported Aerosol Cans Contained Banned Propellant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Forty-three percent of imported aerosol
cosmetics contained chlorofluorocarbon compounds banned as
propellants by the United States 10 years ago, according to the
Customs Service.
   The non-compliance rate is below some spot checks in the past,
according to Don Cousins, chief of the technical branch in the
Office of Technical Services in the Customs Service. The figure has
been as high as 60 percent, he said Monday.
   Customs has never before undertaken anything like the current
checks in ``Operation Ozone,'' which spokesman Dennis Shimkoski
said constituted ``pretty near 100 percent'' of all pending imports.
   The service checked 442 samples of aerosol products since Feb.
15, said Shimkoski. Of those, 188 contained the offending compounds.
   More than 60 different products were represented in the samples.
Shimkoski said most were perfumes made in France, but deodorants,
baby powders and shaving creams also were found.
   The United States banned almost all use of chlorofluorocarbon,
or CFC, compounds as aerosol propellants in 1978 out of concern
that they might be attacking the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles high
that shields the Earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the
sun.

   The World Bank is lending Brazil $109 million
to fight AIDS and three other diseases in the northeastern part of
the country.
   It was the first time that the bank, which is owned by 151
countries, has lent money for AIDS in Latin America. Last December
the fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the
African republic of Burundi was helped by financing from the fund.
   Brazil has 2,100 AIDS patients. Only the United States and
France have reported more.
   The loan, announced Monday, is being made to Brazil's Northeast
Endemic Disease Control project and will be used against
schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease, particularly
widespread among poor people in the area.
   Total cost of the project is put at $218 million. The loan is
for 15 years, including a three-year grace period during which only
interest need be paid. The World Bank charges a variable rate

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis
edged ahead of rival Jesse Jackson in Colorado's precinct caucuses
early Tuesday, after a night of furious see-saw battling.
Meanwhile, Republicans pointed to Vice President George Bush as
their heavy favorite.
   With 1,234 of Colorado's 2,784 precincts reporting, or 44
percent, Dukakis had 45 percent to Jackson's 40 percent. Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore had just 4 percent, and Sen. Paul Simon did not
garner enough votes at Monday night's caucuses to register any
support.
   Dukakis had moved to an early lead in preliminary sample
results, but that evaporated when returns from Denver began coming
in. Later, however, he moved ahead again.
   Democratic state chairman Buie Seawell, a Dukakis supporter,
said early Tuesday that Jackson had done ``one hell of a job in a
state that is not Jackson country.''
   In Colorado, Dukakis and Jackson were fighting it out for 45
national convention delegates and bragging rights to a victory on
the eve of the Wisconsin primary.
   The Colorado Democratic caucuses took on added importance
because of the tight race for delegates that has developed between
Jackson and Dukakis, with Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. trailing.
   Republicans also held caucuses to begin the process of selecting
36 delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   Republican straw poll results suggested Bush was winning
overwhelmingly. The GOP expected Bush to capture most of the
Republian support here despite weekend appearances in Colorado by
former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Sigrid Freese, a state Democratic spokeswoman, expected only
15,000 to 20,000 of Colorado's 570,301 registered Democrats to
attend the caucuses. ``It depends on how good the NCAA championship
basketball game is,'' she said of the Monday night game.
   At one caucus _ in Precinct 31, in Grand Junction _ the
21-member caucus solved that problem by recessing for 35 minutes to
watch the game.
   The two Democratic front-runners campaigned in Colorado over the
weekend, and both campaigns aired TV ads in hopes of attracting
supporters to the caucuses in one-time candidate Gary Hart's home
state.
   Seawell predicted Dukakis could land 15 to 20 delegates and
Jackson 15, with the remaining delegates either uncommitted or
backing Gore, who was expected to attract support outside
metropolitan Denver.
   Jackson presented himself as the candidate of hope and invoked
the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., whose was assassinated 20
years ago. ``Hope has been unleashed,'' Jackson told a crowd of
church-goers Sunday.
   Dukakis, endorsed by Seawell and Gov. Roy Romer, visited Denver
on Saturday, continuing to sound his theme that he is ``a doer''
and ``not just a talker'' but avoiding direct criticism of Jackson.
   Some political observers said the key to winning Democratic
delegates was in the Hispanic community, where Dukakis, with his
command of the Spanish language, and Jackson, with his appeal to
minorities, both hoped to fare well.
   Seawell says the outcome of future contests in California, New
Mexico and Arizona, which have large Hispanic populations, may
depend on which candidate can win Hispanic voters here.
   Hispanics make up about 12 percent of the registered voters
statewide.
   Blacks, expected to support Jackson, comprise 4 percent of
registered Democrats.

   His governorship gone, his ailing auto
dealership sold, Evan Mecham faces a future in which one of the few
certainties is his role as defendant in a criminal trial.
   But for Arizona, the future looks brighter without the shadow of
Mecham's embarrassing impeachment trial hanging over the state,
said Rose Mofford, who became governor with Mecham's removal.
   ``Today we have reached the end of some difficult times in
Arizona,'' Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, said Monday. ``I know the
decision made by the Senate today was not reached lightly. It is
time to put all that behind us and move forward.''
   ``Today none of us are Republicans, none of us are Democrats,''
she said. ``We are all Arizonans. Let us go forward together as
Arizonans.''
   The impeached first-term Republican was stripped of his office
Monday when the Senate convicted him of trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat and misusing the
governor's protocol fund.
   The end of the trial did not heal the divisions that arose
during Mecham's turbulent 15 months in office. Predictably, the
verdict was praised by Mecham opponents and condemned by supporters.
   Some legislators received police protection Monday night after
getting threatening phone calls that were prompted by the vote,
said Department of Public Safety spokesman Allan Schmidt.
   ``They've been all types of intimidating-type threatening
statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,'' Schmidt
said.
   Mecham's future troubles could include a maximum 22-year prison
sentence if he is convicted on charges of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan.
   He faces trial April 21 in Maricopa County Superior Court on six
felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents. His
brother Willard, who was his 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three
similar counts.
   The Senate threw out an impeachment count based on the $350,000
loan issue.
   Although the Senate did not bar Mecham from holding public
office again, his lawyer, Jerris Leonard, indicated after the
impeachment vote that Mecham may decide to bow out of politics.
   ``I think there is doubt,'' he said of whether Mecham would try
to appeal his case to voters in a recall election May 17.
   It was not clear whether the ousted governor could remain on the
recall ballot given him impeachment conviction. The matter probably
will be decided by the courts, said Attorney General Bob Corbin.
   Leonard said, ``I think the decision of where we go from now is
dependent on whether or not the governor himself wants to stay in
politics and that's something that he's got to decide overnight.''
   After Monday's conviction, Mecham left the Senate chamber
smiling. Asked what he planned next, he said, ``We'll decide
tomorrow or the next day ... We're keeping all our options open.''
   After he was impeached by the House of Representatives on Feb.
5, the 63-year-old Mecham hinted he might give up politics. ``If I
can be of service, fine,'' he said. ``If not, I'd enjoy private
life. The best person doesn't always win. Politics is not my
favorite pastime.''
   Mecham ran for governor five times before being elected in 1986.
   Although Mecham's son, Dennis, testified last week that their
Mecham Pontiac dealership in suburban Glendale was thriving, he
announced a day later that they'd been forced to sell it for $4
million because of dwindling sales.
   Dennis Mecham said bad publicity surrounding his father's
political battles had driven customers away.
   The dealership was sold last week.

<HEAD>Mother and Children Died in Murder-Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deaths of a distraught Japanese-born
woman and her two young daughters in a house fire was a type of
Japanese murder-suicide intended to prevent the children from
becoming orphans, police said.
   Physical evidence found at the home and interviews with the
woman's husband led to that conclusion, Detective Sgt. John Haradon
said Monday.
   Mitsue Sakai, 28, was found Sunday in a bedroom along with her
daughters, Seira Candy Sakai, 5, and Rina Stephanie Sakai, 4. All
three died of smoke inhalation, Haradon said.
   Mitsue and Hideo Sakai had been having marital problems, the
investigator said.
   The murder-suicide, known in Japanese as oyako shinju, is a
tradition in which parents planning suicide feel obliged to kill
their children so they will not be orphans.
   Mrs. Sakai, who moved to the United States from Kobe, Japan,
about eight years ago, and her husband, Hideo, from Yokohama, were
described by acquaintances as quiet and hard-working people.
   Mrs. Sakai worked at the Mitsuyoshi Japanese restaurant in
Anaheim. Her husband is head chef at the Amagi Japanese restaurant
in Buena Park.
   Yoshikazu Suzuki, owner of the Amagi restaurant, said the couple
met at his establishment about seven years ago when Mrs. Sakai
worked there as a waitress.
   ``If she lost hope or something, she cannot let the children
live,'' Suzuki said. ``I know of many cases in Japan like that.''
   An estimated 300 cases of oyako shinju are reported each year in
Japan, authorities said.
   The tragedy recalled the case of Fumiko Kimura, a Japanese-born
woman whose two young children died when she walked into the sea
with them at Santa Monica in 1985. Her mother-child suicide attempt
was carried out in shame over her husband's alleged adultery.
   Mrs. Kimura pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was
placed on five years' probation.
   Although oyako shinju is illegal in Japan, it is considered an
honorable way to die and lingers in the culture, said Mamoru Iga, a
professor of sociology at California State University, Northridge,
and author of ``The Thorn in the Chrysanthemum: Suicide and
Economic Success in Modern Japan.''
   Iga said the crime is most often committed by mothers who have
money problems or bad marriages.

<HEAD>Arbitrators Side With Smokey The Cat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A panel of arbitrators has sided with Smokey
the cat, saying the owners of an office supply business were not
negligent for keeping the feline in their store after it was
accused of scratching a customer.
   News of the case prompted patrons of J.R. Weldin & Co. and
numerous others to contribute more than $2,000 to the defense fund
of the 17-year-old, somewhat asthmatic cat.
   ``He (Smokey) is a star,'' said store manager Margaret Brown,
who denied the cat attacked customer Nicole Sikorski. ``As long as
he's living, he won't leave the store.''
   At a hearing Monday attended by about 45 Smokey supporters, a
panel of three lawyers from the arbitration division of Allegheny
County Common Pleas Court rejected the claims of Ms. Sikorski, 24,
of suburban Upper Saint Clair.
   The arbitrators said they awarded no damages to Ms. Sikorski
because her attorney failed to prove damages or show Smokey has a
record of attacking customers.
   Ms. Sikorski had been seeking an unspecified award for nominal
damages, plus $1,500 in punitive damages and another $1,500 for her
scars.
   Ms. Sikorski testified that Smokey ``came from nowhere'' and
sank his front claws into her left wrist while she was making a
purchase in October. She said she has a tiny scar and about a
half-dozen pinprick marks on the back of her wrist.
   Smokey's defense fund will be divided among the Humane Society,
Animal Friends, the Animal Rescue League and the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Ms. Brown said.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Locked In Colorado Battle As Wisconsin Primary
Day Dawns</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 4 grafs Colorado results, Dukakis ahead of
Jackson, counting over for the night. Should stand for AMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis carved out a
narrow lead over rival Jesse Jackson early Tuesday as votes were
counted in Colorado's caucuses. Each of the front-runners had hoped
for a solid win to provide ``bounce'' going into Tuesday's
Wisconsin primary, but there was no clear winner when counting was
called off for the night.
   With 1,234 of 2,784 precincts reporting, or 44 percent, Dukakis
had 46 percent to Jackson's 40 percent. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. lagged far behind, with 4 percent, and Sen. Paul Simon wasn't
registering any support from the Monday night caucuses.
   Late Monday, preliminary returns from a party sampling of 130
precincts gave Dukakis a 2-1 lead over Jackson. But when Denver
precincts began weighing in with tallies early Tuesday morning,
Dukakis' lead disappeared in a Jackson surge. Then Dukakis battled
his way back.
   The Democratic party quit counting for the night at about 4:30
a.m. EDT. The results were still too incomplete to determine
conclusively how many national convention delegates each candidate
won.
   Meanwhile, Jackson came under fire for his contact with
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Earlier, Dukakis called Jackson's involvement in the Panama
situation a ``bad idea.''
   Gore also criticized Jackson's correspondence with Noriega, but
he blasted Dukakis for being ``absolutely timid'' of Jackson.
   The Massachusetts governor dismissed Gore and his comments: ``I
don't know what he's serious about.''
   Jackson, Dukakis and Gore were joined by Simon campaigning
across Wisconsin on Monday. Simon is trailing badly in his effort
to win here and keep his campaign alive, while Gore needs a good
showing in the state to boost his faltering effort.
   Simon urged voters in Milwaukee to send a message Tuesday.
``We're not going to follow the pollsters; we're going to elect the
man best qualified to be president,'' he said, quipping: ``Al Gore
agrees with that too.''
   Dukakis' aides emphasized how close the race is in Wisconsin,
but Tom Loftus, speaker of the Wisconsin state assembly and a
Dukakis backer, said the Massachusetts governor ``is going to win
by enough _ three, four or five points.''
   Jackson and Dukakis, the front-runners in both states, awaited
the slow dribble of results from the 2,784 precinct caucuses in
Colorado that will divide 45 national convention delegates.
   The Republicans were holding caucuses Monday night in Colorado
as well as the Democrats. With Vice President George Bush already
having locked up the nomination, Pat Robertson's effort to win some
of the state's 36 GOP delegates was a symbolic gesture.
   Jackson and Dukakis are the front-runners in the AP delegate
count. Before the Colorado results were known, Dukakis had 653.55
votes and Jackson 646.55. Gore had 381.8 and Simon 169.5. A total
of 468.6 were uncommitted. At the Atlanta in July, 2,082 votes are
needed to win.
   Jackson again released his letter, along with a reply from
Noriega on Monday. In his letter, the Panamanian dictator rejects
Jackson's plea in a March 22 letter to leave the country.
   ``I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the
Panamanian people for Gen. Noriega to leave. Today I reiterate my
public moral appeal for him to depart,'' Jackson said.
   But Jackson's involvement in the turbulent Panamanian situation
drew criticism from the State Department and from Dukakis and Gore.
   ``In our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that Noriega
likes to use to buy time,'' said State spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   However, Jackson said he had talked Monday afternoon by
telephone with high-ranking State Department officials _ John C.
Whitehead, the deputy secretary of state, and Michael H. Armacost,
undersecretary of state for political affairs _ and said they
offered no disagreement with his appeal for Noriega to leave.
   Dukakis told reporters in Milwaukee that ``I think it's a bad
idea for a private citizen to try to inject himself'' into a
delicate international situation. But the Massachusetts governor
added he thought Jackson had acted out of good intentions.
   Gore said Jackson had met with other foreign leaders _ such as
PLO chief Yasser Arafat and Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi.
Jackson campaign spokesman Eric Easter, though, said Jackson had
never met with the Libyan leader.
   ``He didn't help matters in his meetings with Arafat and
Gadhafi,'' Gore said in Madison. ``I seriously doubt if he would
help in Panama.''
   Simon, for his part, would not join the chorus of criticism of
Jackson. ``I don't criticize someone who is not on the inside, so
to speak, on how he feels he'd handle these things,'' he said.
   Gore saved his strongest criticism for Dukakis for not hitting
Jackson harder.
   ``Michael Dukakis gives the impression of being scared to
death'' to criticize Jackson and appears ``absolutely timid,'' Gore
said. ``That is the opposite of the bold leadership'' the nation
needs.
   Gore told the New York Times that Dukakis' actions are ``a
subtle form of racism.''
   Dukakis was clearly irritated by Gore.
   ``Sen. Gore ought to start camaigning for the presidency,''
Dukakis said, cutting off a reporter who sought to question him on
the issue.
   Gore lumped Dukakis and Jackson together, saying neither ``has
had as much as a single day in national government'' that would
prepare them to be president.
   That criticism of Jackson was echoed by Sen. Sam Nunn, the
Georgia Democrat who declined to enter the 1988 Democratic
presidential race.
   ``I just don't think he has the experience, and I just disagree
with him on some basic foreign policy and defense questions,'' Nunn
told reporters in Georgia.
   Nunn said Jackson should not view opposition within the party as
racist. ``I don't think it should be deemed an insult or racist,''
he said.
   And he said Jackson can't win the White House: ``If nominated, I
don't think there'd be much chance of winning.''
   That view was echoed by former President Nixon.
   ``If he is nominated, it goes without saying he cannot win. But
everyone is overplaying the fact that he would be a liability
because he is black,'' Nixon told The Washington Times. ``That is
simply not true. Jackson would be a liability because his views are
radical.''
   There was good news on the fund-raising front for Jackson, who
shocked even his own campaign by raising more than $2 million in
March. Jackson, who has run a low-budget campaign until now, will
spend the money on advertising in New York's crucial April 19
primary.

<HEAD>Convicted Kidnapper Could Be `Marked Man' As Parole Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted kidnapper Kenneth Parnell will be
a ``marked man'' if he decides to return to Mendocino County, where
he was arrested for holding two boys captive eight years ago, a
county official said.
   ``Let him go to some other state. Let him stay away from this
county. There's still hard feelings here,'' Mendocino County
Supervisor John Cimolino. State Department of Corrections spokesman
Bob Gore said Parnell is to be discharged from parole today, but
that his office was not aware of any protest over the action.
   Parnell, 56, was paroled to Alameda County in the San Francisco
Bay area after serving five years in prison for kidnapping Steven
Stayner, then 7, from Merced on Dec. 4, 1972, and Timothy White,
then 5, from Ukiah on Valentine's Day in 1980. Both boys were
abducted while walking home from school.
   Although Stayner said Parnell regularly sexually abused him,
charges of child abuse against Parnell were dismissed in 1981 when
a state appeals court said the statute of limitations had expired.
   Word of Parnell's release angered Stayner, who said he can't
forgive him. During the trial, Stayner testified that Parnell
ordered him to call him ``Dad,'' renamed him Dennis Parnell and
told people Stayner was his son throughout the eight years they
roamed northern California, living in trailer parks and motels.
   A psychologist testified during Parnell's trial that Stayner had
been brainwashed by Parnell and for years was unable to attempt
escape.
   Stayner, now a 23-year-old college student and father of two,
said Parnell remains a threat to children.
   ``I pity him for the sickness he has. I wouldn't trust him
around any child of any age,'' said Stayner, who hopes to become a
police officer.
   Stayner said he escaped from Parnell on March 1, 1980, and
hitchiked 40 miles with White to seek help from Ukiah police to
save the boy from sexual abuse. Parnell had kidnapped White two
weeks earlier and held him in a one-room cabin in a remote area
west of Ukiah.
   When Parnell was released from prison in 1985, former Mendocino
County District Attorney Joseph Allen expressed concern. ``There's
no doubt in my mind he will do it again,'' Allen said.
   Mike Echols, a Colorado-based author who wrote an NBC_TV
mini-steries about the Parnell case, said Parnell told him six
months ago that he planned to move to Mendocino when his parole
expired.
   His parole conditions had required him to stay in Alameda
County, attend weekly therapy sessions and stay away from children.
He also was prohibited from traveling through Mendocino or Merced
counties.
   ``He's a free man, of course,'' Cimolino said. ``We're powerless
to do anything about where he goes. But if he comes to Ukiah, I
think he'll be a marked man.''
   Echols said Parnell, a former hotel clerk and drifter, has lived
in a Berkeley boarding house since 1985, working as a short-order
cook and dishwasher between bouts of unemployment.
   ``People have yet to forget what took place,'' said A.G.
Rochester, Mendocino County's undersheriff. ``And yet ... unless he
breaks a law, there's not much we can do about it.''
   The county opposed Parnell's three-year parole to that area
when, because of good behavior and work credits, he was released
from prison after serving five years of his concurrent eight-year,
eight-month sentences for his two kidnapping convictions.

<HEAD>Dukakis Ahead in Colorado Caucuses, Awaits Today's Wisconsin Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, fresh from a flurry of
campaigning in Wisconsin, was optimistic about the outcome of
today's Democratic presidential primary in that state as he
returned to his home base.
   ``We worked hard,'' Dukakis said shortly after his chartered jet
landed at Logan International Airport just before midnight Monday.
   ``It looks good,'' he said of his Wisconsin campaign, ``but you
never know until the votes come in.''
   Early today, Dukakis and Jesse Jackson were still dueling
furiously for a first-place finish in Monday night's Colorado
caucuses. Early returns put Dukakis well ahead, but the race
narrowed dramatically in the wee hours of the morning as Denver
returns began coming in.
   When the Democratic party finished counting for the night,
Dukakis held a 46 percent to 40 percent lead over Jackson, but
fewer than half the precincts were in, and counting was not to
resume until late this afternoon.
   Before he left Wisconsin Monday, Dukakis promised in a speech in
Stevens Point that he would avoid criticism of rival Jackson.
   ``I've been in politics for 25 years and this is the first time
I've been attacked for not attacking somebody else,'' Dukakis said
at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point before a crowd of
2,000.
   That was in reference to another Democratic contender, Tennessee
Sen. lbert Gore Jr., repeatedly blasting Dukakis for being too
``timid'' about taking on Jackson.
   Dukakis also said he believes that either he or Jackson will
have a ``substantial lead'' in delegates by the end of the primary
season in June.
   In his final Wisconsin appearance before heading home, Dukakis
told supporters that every vote counts.
   ``When you go home tonight, make a few phone calls, get a hold
of your neighbors. Believe me, your work will make the ...
difference,'' Dukakis said.
   ``This is a very tight race. It's a very competitive race,'' he
said.
   After Dukakis left the state, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Tom
Loftus told a reporter he believed Dukakis would come out the
winner in today's presidential preference primary.
   ``The independent, the (Sen. Paul) Simon voters are turning his
way,'' said Loftus.
   Simon, of Illinois, has trailed far behind front-runners Dukakis
and Jackson in pre-election polls, as has Gore.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham was removed from
office by the Legislature because he was too loyal to some aides
and disregarded advice from politicians who could have helped him,
both supporters and opponents say.
   But some observers were more critical of the first-term
governor, who was convicted by the state Senate on Monday.
   ``Here's a guy who was going to clean up state government
because it was too corrupt, and he brings in a whole legion of
people who are accused in various sorts of ways of being corrupt,
and some are facing trial now,'' said Democratic Minority Leader
Alan Stephens.
   Mecham exhibited ``a pattern of behavior that is given to deceit
as standard operating procedure,'' added Sen. Greg Lunn.
   Still others said the former Republican governor failed to build
support, apparently forgetting that he won the governorship with
only 40 percent of the vote in a three-way race.
   ``You've got to understand that here was a man who was elected
essentially without the press and without the (Republican) party.
... What he forgot was that he couldn't survive without them,''
said former top Mecham aide Sam Steiger, who resigned to face an
extortion charge for allegedly trying to influence a Parole Board
member's vote.
   Even Mecham backers did not agree with his claim that he was a
victim of a conspiracy by legislators and others in the GOP
establishment, such as Attorney General Bob Corbin.
   Mecham insisted on making Max Hawkins, a loyal backer, director
of the Department of Administration despite strong opposition from
many legislators. Hawkins eventually admitted that he told the
governor an alleged death threat by DOA aide Lee Watkins was ``a
lot of hot air'' and would go away.
   On Monday, Mecham was convicted of obstructing a state
investigation of the alleged death threat, one of two impeachment
articles that led to his removal.
   Watkins himself was allowed to stay on for a while after
allegedly making the threat and after a decades-old youthful
robbery conviction came to light.
   In addition, Mecham ignored advice from his chief of staff, Jim
Colter, who said it would be politically unwise to loan $80,000
from the governor's protocol fund to Mecham Pontiac. On the basis
of that loan, Mecham was also convicted Monday of misusing state
funds.
   Sen. James Sossaman, a Republican who generally has supported
the governor, said he believed Mecham's problems stemmed more from
``perception of his inability to make a good chief executive
officer for the state of Arizona than ... whether he committed any
crimes.''
   Mecham's relations with the media and the Legislature were often
stormy, spurred on by his ``continual ability to undermine his own
credibility by silly or stupid statements,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Bob Usdane, a Republican.
   Lunn, also a Republican, cited the governor's claim in Senate
testimony _ retracted a day later _ that the former head of his
security detail had stolen a report from Colter's desk.
   Former governor and U.S. Sen. Paul Fannin was a member of a
group of Arizona ``elder statesmen'' formed last summer to help
Mecham with his troubles. Fannin said he advised the governor to
try harder to get along with the media and the Legislature. ``But
he's very stubborn and determined in his ways.''
   House Speaker Joe Lane contended, however, that Mecham's
relations with the Legislature were really no worse than those of
his predecessor, Democrat Bruce Babbitt.

   Several players in a national
desegregation drama will return to the University of Alabama to
mark the 25th anniversary of the day then-Gov. George C. Wallace
tried to block the entrance of two black students.
   To commemorate the event June 11 _ a milestone in the civil
rights struggle _ the university will host a three-day symposium
called ``Opening Doors,'' featuring some of the nation's leading
scholars on race relations.
   The university ``felt the best way to recognize this event was
through a symposium that focuses not only on the history of race
relations, the stand in the door, but also the present and future
of race relations,'' said Professor E. Culpepper Clark, who is
writing a book on that era.
   Clark and Harry Knopke, a university official helping to arrange
the symposium, said they believe the school was an unwilling pawn
in power plays between Wallace and the administration of President
John Kennedy.
   ``The university had a very substantive, productive plan for
integrating,'' Knopke said. ``In the late 1950s and early 1960s the
administration and others were looking seriously at ways to
integrate. There was a plan already in place for doing that when
Wallace started speaking.
   ``The university was just in the middle of it.''
   Among those who have agreed to take part in the symposium, which
will end June 11, is Nicholas Katzenbach, who as assistant attorney
general faced off with Wallace in the doorway of Foster Auditorium,
a few hours before students Vivian Malone and Jimmy Hood walked in
to register.
   Also agreeing to take part are Miss Malone, now Mrs. Mack Jones
of Atlanta; Frank Rose, president of the university at the time;
then-Dean John L. Blackburn, and George LeMaistre, a prominent
Tuscaloosa businessman who organized community support for the
school's desegregation.
   ``We wanted to bring back some of the individuals who were
involved in the Wallace stand to share their perspectives,'' Knopke
said. ``We want to make something positive out of it, something
productive and informative.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was invited to represent his slain
brothers, the president and Robert Kennedy, who was attorney
general in 1963, but he said he had another commitment.
   Knopke said he doubted that Wallace, who has been in poor
health, will be able to attend, but that documentary footage of the
governor's stand will be shown.
   Wallace has said he made his stand to reduce the possibility of
violence at the university, although critics said it increased
tensions.
   An array of scholars will present papers dealing with race
relations today and what can be expected in the future, Clark said.
   ``There is always in the minds of Alabamians the fact that 25
years later we are far different than in 1963, yet we still
sometimes get in our minds that we're frozen in 1963,'' he said.
``What happened then is history and we're a far different people
than we were then.''
   The school-door standoff, Clark said, ``was a test of wills
between Wallace and the Kennedy administration, the state of
Alabama and federal authorities.'' Wallace, he said, has since
acknowledged that he made ``a terrible public relations mistake.''
   Clark said the university, with 10 percent black enrollment
today, ``is so long past all that in the actual workings of this
institution and carrying out its mission that sometimes we have to
pinch ourselves to see if that were really us and if it were, what
does it have to do with us now.''
   That, he said, is the purpose of the symposium.

<HEAD>Sources in Syria Report Possible Release of Three French Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS FARES</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deal has been struck under which France
and Iran will resume diplomatic relations and three Frenchmen held
by a pro-Iranian group in Lebanon will be released, two sources in
Damascus said today.
   If there are no last-minute snags, the release could come ``in
the next few days,'' one of the sources said.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry would not comment on the
report. British and Lebanese newspapers also have reported that
representatives of France and Iran have been meeting secretly to
work out a hostage deal.
   The two sources in Damascus declined to be identified but have
proved reliable on hostage matters in the past. They said a special
envoy of the French government spent two days negotiating with the
hostage takers in their stronghold in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
   The sources said the envoy, Alexandre Stefani, an associate of
French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, and an unidentified
Lebanese businessman, returned to Damascus on Monday through a
checkpoint on the Lebanese-Syrian border controlled by the Syrian
army.
   The sources said Stefani and the Lebanese businessman were
involved in previous negotiations which led to the release Nov. 27,
1987, of two French hostages.
   The three French hostages held in Lebanon are Jean-Paul Kaufman,
42, a journalist taken May 22, 1985, and two diplomats, Marcel
Carton, 63, and Marcel Fontaine, 46, both seized March 22, 1985.
   The kidnappings were claimed by Islamic Jihad or Islamic Holy
War, a group of Moslems of the Shiite sect loyal to Iran's leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Moslem militants claimed in March 1985 that they killed a fourth
French hostage, researcher Michel Seurat, but no body has been
found.
   Shiite militants loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the
22 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans. The
longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The two Frenchmen released last November were Jean-Louis
Normandin, 34, a lighting engineer for France's Antenne-2
television, who was kidnapped March 8, 1986, and Roger Auque, 31, a
free-lance photographer kidnapped Jan. 13, 1987.
   France broke relations with Iran in July 1987 in a dispute over
an employee of the Iranian Embassy in Paris who refused to give
evidence to a French court on terrorist incidents.
   The Beirut daily As-Safir on March 31 reported progress in
``secret negotiations'' to free the three hostages. In London, the
Daily Mail, quoting unidentified French intelligence sources,
reported Monday that Iran and France are close to sealing a hostage
deal.
   France released a terrorist suspect, Mohamed Mohajer, a Lebanese
Shiite, on March 24. It cited insufficient evidence to hold him for
involvement in a series of 1986 bombings. Officials denied at the
time the release had anything to do with the hostage negotiations.

<HEAD>Government Opens Case Against Man Accused of Collaborating With
Nazis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The government is trying to deport a Latvian
accused of collaborating with the Nazis in a case described by one
federal official as so strong ``I would not want to be defending
it.''
   Konrads Kalejs came to United States in 1959 saying he was a
farmer in Latvia. What he failed to disclose, the government
maintains, is that he belonged to a pro-Nazi police unit in World
War II that killed Jews by the thousands.
   ``Its main task was essentially rounding people up, guarding
them and killing them,'' said Raul Hilberg, a political science
professor at the University of Vermont and an expert on the
Holocaust.
   Hilberg was the government's main witness Monday as the
Immigration and Naturalization Service opened deportation hearings.
   The government said it has evidence that Kalejs was a commander
in the Latvian Security Auxiliary Police, whose leader was
convicted in 1979 of the murders of at least 13,000 people from
1941-44.
   In 1985 the Justice Department filed for Kalejs' deportation,
saying he lied on his entrance visa and would not have been
admitted to this country if officials had known about his past.
   The government's case is expected to last several weeks. During
that time, attorneys plan to summon witnesses who survived the
Latvian death camps and present documents detailing the actions of
Kalejs and the unit.
   Kalejs, 74, of Winnetka had little to say during proceedings
Monday. He stared straight ahead as Hilberg testified, occasionally
chewing gum and whispering to his attorney, Ivars Berzins.
   As he stepped onto an elevator, Kalejs was asked for comment and
replied, ``Good morning. That's all my comment.''
   Berzins also refused to discuss the case.
   ``This is one of the strongest cases I have witnessed,'' said
Bruce J. Einhorn, deputy litigation director of the Justice
Department's Nazi-hunting arm. ``This case involves some very
powerful evidence. I would not want to be defending it.''
   During the first day of testimony before Immigration Judge
Anthony D. Petrone, government attorney Aron Golberg asked Hilberg
to describe the German invasion of Latvia and the formation of the
police unit in charge of killing Jews.
   Hilberg, the author of the book ``The Destruction of the
European Jews,'' said the Latvian Security Auxiliary Police was
formed shortly after German troops seized control of the country
from the Soviets.
   The security police was comprised mostly of Latvians who admired
Adolf Hitler and welcomed the German invasion.
   ``Some of them wanted action, wanted to be associated with
power,'' he said. ``There was also promise here of compensation.''
   Asked if members volunteered, Hilberg replied, ``Absolutely.''
   ``Anyone with scruples would obviously not volunteer without
realizing what was going on,'' he said.
   Kalejs was denied bond when the deportation charge was filed in
spring 1985, but he was later released on $750,000 bond.
   Kalejs, a citizen of Australia, would have the choice of country
if he is deported, Einhorn said. If a country refused to admit him,
the government would make a recommendation.
   Kalejs owns property in Illinois, St. Petersburg, Fla., and Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., according to the INS.

<HEAD>Colorado Democratic Caucuses Stir Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At one Denver neighborhood caucus, Democrats split
their county convention delegates between Jesse Jackson and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis after the state party chairman
and a prominent state senator took opposite sides.
   At a GOP caucus not far away, Republicans went for Vice
President George Bush in a straw poll, except for one diehard
supporter for Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, who has dropped out of the
race.
   At a Grand Junction Democratic caucus, a timeout was called so
participants could watch the final minutes of the Kansas-Oklahoma
game for the NCAA basketball championship.
   And at the executive mansion of Gov. Roy Romer, where another
Democratic precinct caucus was held, Dukakis was the 2-to-1
favorite.
   At 2,784 Democratic caucuses and the same number of GOP
neighborhood gatherings across Colorado on Monday night, Coloradans
took the first step in choosing delegates to their national party
conventions this summer.
   The spotlight was on Democrats because of the tight
Jackson-Dukakis race and because the Colorado caucuses could give
one of the candidates momentum going into today's Wisconsin
primary. At stake were 45 of the state's 51 Democratic delegates to
the national convention.
   The interest level was reflected by turnout, which was
considered good at Democratic caucuses and thin at GOP gatherings,
party officials said.
   On the Republican side, Bush was expected to capture most of
Colorado's 36 GOP delegates to the Republican National Convention,
although Bush campaign officials were wary of an ambush by Pat
Robertson, who spent three days in Colorado on Easter weekend. The
ambush failed to materialize in early returns.
   State Democratic chairman Buie Seawell and Regis Groff, a black
state senator from Denver, took opposite sides at Denver's Precinct
822, with Seawell endorsing Dukakis and Groff urging support for
Jackson.
   Seawell, who is one of six Colorado ``super delegates'' to the
national convention and already committed to Dukakis, said Dukakis
not only has governed Massachusetts well, but ``I believe Michael
Dukakis can win.''
   Groff, known for his fiery rhetoric, said he had been a Dukakis
supporter until recently, when Jackson's message persuaded him to
switch sides.
   ``His message is an American message,'' said Groff. ``He speaks
to all Americans.''
   Four of the precincts seven delegates were sent to the county
convention committed to Jackson and three to Dukakis.
   At the Republican caucus in Precinct 623 of Denver's Capitol
Hill, Bush swept a straw poll, 17-1.
   ``All year long, Precinct 623 has been a Dole precinct, and
there was one diehard vote for Dole tonight,'' said caucus
chairperson Evamarie McGowan.
   At Denver Precinct 637, the executive mansion on Capitol Hill,
Romer _ who already has endorsed Dukakis and will go to Atlanta as
a super delegate _ saw his precinct send six delegates to the
county convention committed to Dukakis and three for Jackson.
   ``Tonight, we're all equal,'' Romer said prior to his remarks in
support of Dukakis, ``and this party thrives on good competitive
issues. I have the highest respect for Jesse Jackson and Al Gore.
But I think Mike Dukakis is the best qualified _ and the most
electable.''
   At another Democratic precinct caucus on Denver's Capitol Hill,
Precinct 621A, the delegates were split 3-3 for Jackson and
Dukakis, with one delegate uncommitted.
   ``I want to throw the rascals out and Duke's the man,'' said Ray
McCall, a Dukakis supporter and a delegate to the county convention.
   Democrats in Precinct 31 in north Grand Junction heard a
spirited debate between Dukakis and Jackson supporters before
recessing for 35 minutes to watch the final 2 minutes and 11
seconds of the NCAA championship basketball game.
   Then, the caucus decided to send four Dukakis delegates, three
uncommitted delegates and one Jackson delegate to the Mesa County
convention.
   When precinct chairman Joe Coleman tried to resume discussions
with seven seconds left in the game, one Democrat said, ``Get the
basketball game over with. Let's get our priorities straight.''

   Iraq today fired missiles into two
Iranian cities, killing or wounding dozens of people, and Iran
shelled the Iraqi city of Basra.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 15 civilians were
killed in a predawn missile explosion today in a residential
district of Iran's holy city of Qom located 100 miles south of
Tehran.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said dozens more were killed
or wounded in two more missile attacks, one on Qom and the other on
Isfahan, several hours later. It said exact casualty figures were
not immeditely available.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said
Iraqi gunners fired two missiles into Qom and one into Isfahan,
capital of the ancient Persian empire, to avenge Iranian attacks on
Iraqi cities.
   Iraq said dozens of civilians were killed or wounded in Iranian
artillery shelling on the southern city of Basra in an attack that
began Monday night and continued into today. No specific casualty
figures were given.
   On Monday, Iran said its artillerymen shelled defensive
positions in the Kurdistan mountains of northeast Iraq, where
Revolutionary Guards have captured a large area around strategic
Lake Darbandikhan in a 3-week-old offensive.
   Iran said guards and Kurdish guerrillas repulsed counterattacks
by two Iraqi brigades in the battle zone, killing or wounding 150
men.
   The Iraqis threatened Monday to level Iran's cities in revenge
for the northern offensive.

<HEAD>Compromise To Create Second Judgeship in Robeson County</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers agreed to support a second
Superior Court judgeship for racially tense Robeson County,
eliminating the need for a special legislative session sought by
supporters of a slain Indian judicial candidate.
   Monday's agreement came during a three-hour meeting in Lumberton
between Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan, Robeson County legislators and members
of the campaign committee of Julian Pierce, who was killed March 26
in what police called a domestic dispute.
   If approved by the General Assembly in its June session,
Republican Gov. Jim Martin could appoint a new Superior Court judge
from Robeson County.
   Martin said he supported the agreement and pledged he would
appoint a minority, and probably an Indian.
   Pierce's supporters had pressured the governor to call a special
legislative session to amend state law to allow another minority
candidate to run for the present judgeship. Filing for the
judgeship closed in February, and state law does not allow a
replacement for a candidate who dies more than 30 days after the
filing period ends.
   The judgeship was one of nine established last year in areas
with predominantly black or Indian populations in an effort to
increase the number of minority judges.
   Rep. Sidney Locks, a black Robeson County leader who was part of
Monday's negotiations, was unenthusiastic about the compromise.
``But we were trying to find some way to diffuse the kinds of
problems we currently have in Robeson County,'' he said.
   Jordan, one of the state's most powerful Democrats, said the
agreement could help ease racial tensions in Robeson County.
   ``I think it certainly can do wonders, at least for the feelings
they have about the justice system,'' he said.
   The proposal also would virtually assure that Joe Freeman Britt,
Robeson County's district attorney, will be elected Superior Court
judge this fall. Pierce, a Lumbee Indian leader in Robeson County,
was Britt's only opposition for the special judgeship created last
year. Britt is white.
   Also on Monday, about 600 people gathered in the place where
Pierce started his campaign for judge three months ago to pledge to
continue his struggle for change.
   ``We must keep the faith. We must not let tragedy keep us down.
We must press on,'' said the Rev. Ben Chavis.
   Many Lumbees and blacks in the county say they are discriminated
against and that they are not represented adequately in local
political offices. The county's population is 37 percent Indian, 37
percent white and 26 percent black.
   The tension was dramatized Feb. 1, when two armed Tuscarora
Indians burst into The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton and took
at least 17 people hostage. No one was injured.

   A man has died from injuries suffered when a

   John B. Payne, 46, of the Beverly Farms Foundation Inc. in
Godfrey, Ill., died Monday at St. Louis University Hospital,
Illinois state police said. He was transferred to St. Louis from
Jersey Community Hospital in Jerseyville, Ill., late Sunday.
   Executive Director Monte Welker said the van's driver, Jeff
Curry, was released from St. Anthony's Hospital in Alton, Ill., on

<HEAD>Survivor: Hooded Gunmen Killed 33 at Easter Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hooded gunmen in army uniforms
surrounded and fired on about 500 people at an Easter festival in a
village plaza, killing 33 and wounding eight, a survivor said.
   ``The one in charge shouted `Kill everyone you can!''' said the
survivor, Segundo Benitez, in an interview Monday with the
Colombian radio chain Caracol.
   Benitez said he counted the dead and wounded in the Sunday
massacre in the small village of Mejor Esquina in northern
Colombia, 280 miles northwest of Bogota, the capital.
   He said a brother, two nephews and a cousin of his were among
the dead. Benitez said there were 10 to 15 attackers.
   ``They just shot at everybody, at those who were dancing and
those who tried to run away. They made a lot of the people lie down
on the ground and then shot them in the head,'' he said.
   Benitez said men, women, old people and children were among the
victims.
   Right-wing death squads in Colombia often wear hoods and army
uniforms.
   The village of 600, in Cordoba state, was celebrating the end of
Holy Week. Enrique Llorente Lopez, the mayor of the nearby town of
Buenavista, said earlier that about 10 men arrived in vehicles
Sunday night at Mejor Esquina. He had heard that 28 people were
killed.
   Cordoba Gov. Jose Miguel Amin said in a broadcast interview with
Caracol that the police told him they did not know who attacked the
townspeople.
   There are more than a dozen right-wing death squads in Colombia.
   Mejor Esquina is in the heart of a mountainous area where a
left-wing guerrilla group, the People's Liberation Army, has been
organizing lately.
   Sunday's attack was the second massacre in Colombia in a month.
   On March 4, a right-wing death squad fired on sleeping workers
at a ranch in northwest Colombia and killed 20 of them.
   Death squads have killed more than 600 people in Colombia in the
last three years.

   The ouster of Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham, who
canceled a state holiday honoring civil rights crusader Martin
Luther King Jr., was cheered by hundreds at a banquet commemorating
King's assassination 20 years ago.
   Southern Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery
announced Mecham's conviction by the Arizona Senate Monday at the
awards dinner that night.
   About 750 people cheered and applauded as the civil rights
anthem, ``We Shall Overcome,'' played softly in the background.
   ``I hate to rejoice,'' Lowery said, ``but I feel good about this
... We did overcome. Justice has been served.''
   Mecham was removed from office 20 years to the day that King,
who founded the SCLC, was shot to death in Memphis, Tenn.
   Mayor Andrew Young, an aide to King and an ordained
Congregationalist minister, reacted to the news with a Bible verse:
``Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.''
   In Altamont, Utah, meanwhile, where Mecham grew up, his removal
from office was lamented by relatives and some old acquaintances.
   ``It's just a dirty deal and Mafia-headed. He has just been
blackballed. I think it's disgusting,'' said his cousin Ona Rust of
Altamont. ``I'm very disappointed in the people of Arizona.''
   Mecham graduated from Altamont High School in 1942 and moved
away after joining the service in 1943. He is scheduled to address
the high school's commencement ceremony May 27.
   A former classmate, Beverly Fieldsted, who was one year behind
Mecham in high school, said Mecham's removal must stem from a
misunderstanding and the former governor is innocent.
   Mecham canceled a King holiday for state workers on Jan. 12,
1987, angering civil rights leaders and triggering a boycott by
some organizations that had planned conventions and by some rock
groups.
   He went on to anger blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with
official actions or offhand remarks.
   Among other things, he defended the use of the word
``pickaninny'' for black children.
   ``I think Gov. Mecham exhibited insensitivity, a corruption of
spirit,'' Lowery said in an interview. ``I think it had to be a
corruption of spirit in order to insult Martin Luther King and the
birthday holiday which the nation wanted to honor.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, stood thoughtfully after being
told of Mecham's impeachment, and declined to comment.
   The SCLC dinner was held to present the group's annual Martin
Luther King Jr. Memorial Drum Major for Justice Awards.

   Twenty-two Britons are among the 96 passengers
aboard a Kuwaiti Airways jet which hijackers threatened to blow up

   A Foreign Office spokesman said he knew of no special reason why
such a high proportion of the passengers were British.
   The spokesman, who in accordance with British practice spoke on
condition he was not identified, said the British Embassy in Kuwait
has a list of the Britons on board. The Foreign Office, however,
did not release the list.
   The Boeing 747 was hijacked today and forced to land in
northeast Tehran, where the hijackers threatened to blow it up if
Iranian authorities approached at Mashhad airport, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency said.

   The federal trial of three white
supremacist leaders and six other men accused of plotting to
overthrow the U.S. government through violence has gone to the jury.
   ``It's all in Yahweh's hands,'' Sheila Beam, wife of supremacist
leader Louis Beam Jr., said after the jury began deliberations
Monday. ``If the truth is known, they'll be acquitted.'' Yahweh is
a Hebrew name for God.
   The jury was to resume deliberations today.
   The case involves 13 defendants, nine of whom are charged with
seditious conspiracy, or conspiring to overthrow the government. A
conviction carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.
   In addition, five of the defendants are accused of conspiring to
kill federal officials and two are charged with interstate
transportation of stolen money. The maximum penalty for murder
conspiracy is life in prison. The stiffest punishment for
transporting stolen money is 10 years.
   Five of the defendants are in prison for other crimes.
   In addition to Beam, 41, of Houston, the supremacist leaders are
Robert E. Miles, 63, of Cohoctah, Mich., and Richard G. Butler, 70
of Hayden Lake, Idaho.
   Miles, pastor of the Mountain Church of Jesus Christ, is the
author of a newsletter that attacked Jews and the federal
government. Butler is the founder of the white supremacist group
Aryan Nations.
   Beam is a former Ku Klux Klan recruiter who left the Klan in
1981 and became a representative for the Aryan Nations.
   The government alleged that the defendants agreed to try to
bring down the government by force during an Aryan Nations congress
in 1983.
   The government contended that some of the defendants went on to
commit a series of robberies to finance their activities. The
robberies netted about $4.1 million, of which about $1 million is
unaccounted for, the government said.
   In closing arguments Monday, U.S. Attorney J. Michael Fitzhugh
said Butler, Beam and Miles came up with the idea for overthrowing
the government.
   Fitzhugh said the sedition defendants maintained they hoped to
bring about a white supremacist nation through a peaceful move to
the Pacific Northwest.
   But, he said, if that was the case, why did:
   _Defendant David Lane say in a taped conversation that he needed
to bomb some major telephone facility?
   _Defendant Bruce Pierce become a member of The Order, a violent
group that committed armed robberies, by taking an oath declaring a
``full state of war''?
   _The Covenant, The Sword and The Arm of The Lord _ an
Arkansas-based supremacist group _ collect an arsenal of automatic
weapons, silencers, grenades and other explosives and embark on
robberies, bombings and murders?
   During the trial, the defense attacked the credibility of
government witnesses.
   But Fitzhugh told jurors, ``Plots made in hell don't have angels
as partners.''
   Attorney N.C. Deday LaRene, representing Miles, said in his
closing argument Monday that the government's key witness, James
Ellison, ``had serious delusions.'' Ellison belonged to the
Arkansas group.
   LaRene said Ellison made up the story about a conspiracy hatched
at Hayden Lake because he lost an appeal of his racketeering
conviction and was looking for a way out of prison.
   The defense attorney said that in three earlier reports about
supremacist activities, Ellison never mentioned that alleged
meeting.

   Hail the size of golfballs pounded parts of North Carolina as
the state and neighboring Virginia bore the brunt of stormy weather
in a day of mostly mild, springlike conditions across the nation.
   Dry, spring weather was expected today for much of the nation,
along with above-normal temperatures.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended along a cold front over
southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina, where
golfball-sized hail pelted Robersonville and Hertford while
Jamesville was struck by ice the size of half dollars.
   Meanwhile, showers were scattered over Maine, Nebraska and South
Dakota.
   Scattered drizzle and patchy, dense fog blanketed portions of
Michigan, western New York state, northern New England and the
middle Texas coastal areas. A dense fog advisory was in effect over
the Texas coastal bend.
   Rain was forecast for western Washington later tonight, and a
snow advisory was issued for the Cascades and Olympics ranges where
3 to 6 inches of snow was expected.
   Winds subsided across southeast Idaho on Monday night after
earlier wind gusts of up to 50 mph were clocked at Resburg, Idaho
Falls and Pocatello.
   The coldest temperatures were in the northwestern U.S., with
late-night readings mostly in the 20s and 30s across the northern
and central Rockies into the western Dakotas; temperatures were in
the 70s over much of southern Texas, south Florida and the desert
southwest.
   Today's forecast called for abundant sunshine around most of the
nation, except across the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest;
showers and thunderstorms scattered over southern and central
Florida and from the middle Mississippi Valley across Wisconsin and
parts of lower Michigan; rain over eastern South Dakota across
southern Minnesota; scattered showers from eastern North Dakota
into upper Michigan; and rain across western Washington state and
northwest Oregon.
   Highs were expected in the 60s or 70s across much of the nation;
in the 50s over Wyoming and the northern quarter of the U.S; in the
80s over the southern third of the country and over southern
sections of the Ohio valley; in the 90s over portions of the desert
southwest and southwest Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 12
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 76 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Wedtech Witness: Contractor Tried to Sell to Iran, Iraq and Saudi
Arabia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ex-Wedtech Corp. executive claims the defense
contractor sought help from a Saudi Arabian prince and friends of
Attorney General Edwin Meese 3rd in an attempt to sell military
equipment to Middle Eastern countries.
   But negotiations to sell bridge pontoons and other supplies to
Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia eventually fell through, former Wedtech
Vice Chairman Mario Moreno testified Monday.
   Moreno, one of four former Wedtech officials testifying at the
racketeering trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi and six others in exchange
for leniency, was asked about the scandal-plagued company's Middle
East dealings in his 14th day on the witness stand.
   The jury was not present during the questioning and U.S.
District Judge Constance Baker Motley later ruled the topic
inadmissible because, she said, it didn't provide any evidence that
a crime had been committed but would unduly prejudice the jury.
   Biaggi and the six others are charged with turning the
now-bankrupt Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise that paid out
millions of dollars in bribes.
   Once a small machine shop in the Bronx, Wedtech grew into a
multimillion-dollar manufacturer through a program that set aside
federal contracts without competitive bidding for minority-owned
companies.
   Prosecutors allege Biaggi and others helped Wedtech falsely
portray itself as a minority concern eligible for the no-bid
program.
   Moreno denied that Wedtech had acted on behalf of the U.S.
government in the Middle East.
   ``No, we were acting as Wedtech,'' said Moreno, one of four
ex-Wedtech executives to plead guilty to state and federal
corruption charges. ``We believed we could do it legally.''
   ``You knew you could never legally have gotten an export license
(to sell military equipment)?'' asked defense attorney Dominic
Amorosa.
   ``It crossed my mind,'' said Moreno, who did not elaborate.
   Asked if E. Robert Wallach, Meese's close friend and former
business associate, had said he could help obtain export licenses,
Moreno replied, ``It never got to that point.''
   Moreno previously testified that Wedtech paid Wallach $800,000
for his ``influence with Ed Meese.'' Meese has not been accused of
wrongdoing in the case.
   The witness said company officials spoke with Wallach ``on two
or three occasions'' about foreign deals.
   Moreno also said a former Meese financial adviser, W. Franklyn
Chinn, was ``a conduit in trying to sell arms to Iraq.''
   Chinn's lawyer, Cristina Arguedas, when called for comment,
said, ``I've never heard this allegation before, and I continue to
deny that Frank Chinn has engaged in any illegal conduct.''
   Both Wallach and Chinn are under federal indictment, accused of
extracting payoffs from Wedtech for allegedly influencing Meese and
other officials.

<HEAD>Ortega Calls U.S. Aid Illegal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega called an aid
package the U.S. Congress approved last week for the Contra rebels
illegal.
   His comments came Monday, one day before the third round of
talks between military leaders for the leftist government and the
Contra rebels aimed at working out the technical details of the
60-day cease-fire that began Friday.
   In another development, reports reaching Managua indicated that
some fighting between Sandinistas and Contras has occurred despite
the truce.
   ``We cannot accept any type of aid to the Contras because it
would be legitimizing the interventionist policy of the United
States,'' Ortega told reporters. ``It is illegal because the United
States has no right to decide what type of government Nicaragua
ought to have.''
   Under a 60-day cease-fire agreement signed March 23 in the
southern border town of Sapoa, the Contras agreed to accept only
humanitarian aid from a neutral organization, such as the
International Red Cross.
   The Sandinistas said they would grant freedom of expression and
amnesty to political prisoners and will allow rebel leaders to take
part in national talks. In today's technical talks, also to be held
in Sapoa, Sandinista and Contra representatives will hammer out
technical details of the truce.
   President Reagan on Friday signed the aid package for the rebels
and victims of the fighting that has battered Nicaragua for more
than six years.
   Only $17.7 million of the $48 million package was directed to
the rebels, and the aid package contains no provision for weapons.
   Despite the cease-fire, Radio Liberation, an underground rebel
station, quoted Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros on Monday as
saying that Sandinista troops had been firing on rebels.
   A transcript of the broadcast also quoted Contra leader Adolfo
Calero as saying the Sandinistas continued bombing civilian towns
in the rural north.
   The pro-government newspaper, El Nuevo Diario, reported that
Contra forces attacked a Sandinista army patrol Saturday, killing
two soldiers and injuring three near the town of Condega, about 120
miles north of Managua.
   The Defense Ministry said there were no reports of cease-fire
violations.
   The cease-fire was arranged to give both sides time to work out
a permanent truce in the war, which has killed more than 40,000
people.
   Under the peace plan, the rebels are to gather in cease-fire
zones during the first two weeks of April. Two days of meetings
last week ended with both sides agreeing only to set up five
cease-fire zones. They failed to work out the size of the areas or
security for the Contras.
   The peace agreement does not mention disarming the rebels, and
the Contras claim they will never surrender their weapons.
   The Sandinistas met the first step of the agreement by releasing
100 political prisoners March 27. The remaining 3,300 political
prisoners are to be released gradually as the terms of the pact are
met.
   The Contras charge the Sandinistas only released 10 political
prisoners that they requested. They say the others served only a
few weeks or were common criminals.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a revolution that ousted the
late President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979. The United States
supported the Sandinistas initially, but in 1981 began financing
the Contras.

   Two-time All-American Danny Manning led
unranked Kansas to an 83-79 victory over No. 4 Oklahoma for its
second national basketball championship and honors as the losingest
winner in NCAA history.
   ``I just wanted to tell all the people who said it couldn't be
done: The national champions are No. 1, and how do you like us
now?'' Manning said after the victory Monday.
   The Jayhawks, with a 26-11 record, avenged two losses to the
Sooners, 35-4, during the regular season.
   Manning scored 31 points and grabbed 18 rebounds to lead Kansas,
an 8-point underdog, to its victory over the Sooners, the nation's
second-leading scoring team and the regular-season and tournament
champions in the Big Eight.
   Milt Newton added 15 points for Kansas, while Kevin Pritchard
had 13. Dave Sieger led Oklahoma with 22 points, including seven
3-pointers, while Stacey King had 17 and Harvey Grant and Mookie
Blaylock 14 each.
   It was the first national championship for a team from west of
the Mississippi River since UCLA won in 1975 and the third
championship game played between two teams from the same conference.

<HEAD>Egyptian Paper Criticizes Palestinian Leaders For Boycotting
Shultz</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Shultz, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading government-owned newspaper today
criticized Palestinian leaders in the Israeli-occupied territories
for boycotting Secretary of State George P. Shultz's efforts for
Middle East peace.
   ``We would have preferred if they (Palestinian leaders) revised
their continued boycott and tried to give a chance for a dialogue
with the American side,'' an editorial in the daily Al-Akhbar said.
   The newspaper said Shultz began talks with Palestinians last
month when he met in Washington with American professors Edward
Said and Ibrahim Abu Lughud, who belong to the legislative arm of
the Palestine Liberation Organization movement to establish a
Palestinian state on Israeli territory.
   It said Shultz's shuttle visits ``to the parties of the
Arab-Israeli conflict (are) ... indications of the seriousness of
(President) Reagan's administration to reach a final settlemenmt of
the region's problem.''
   ``It is true that the American initiative does not meet all the
desires of the Arab side in general and the Palestinians in
particular, but this does not mean it is devoid of any positive
elements that could be built on and promoted during the dialogue,''
the newspaper said.
   It said the initiative has for the first time recognized the
right of the Palestinians for self-rule and called this a ``turning
point in Washington's policy.''
   The U.S. plan calls for three years of self-rule, but not
statehood, for the 1.5 million Palestinians living in the occupied
territories. Negotiations on an overall settlement would open in
December.
   Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. For the last four months
anti-occupation rioting by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip has killed more than 135 Arabs.

   Talks began today on the future of
the last major U.S. military garrisons in Southeast Asia, and the
chief U.S. negotiator said the outcome will affect U.S.-Philippine
relations and regional security.
   ``The significant Soviet presence in the immediate area casts a
shadow over expanding economic activity throughout the region,''
U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt, head of the 10-member American
panel, said in opening remarks.
   The review of a 41-year-old agreement on U.S. bases in the
Philippines comes amid a growing clamor by many Filipinos for
phasing out the garrisons, which they see as a vestige of U.S.
colonialism.
   About 500 people marched this afternoon from the Philippine
Senate to the U.S. Embassy chanting slogans demanding the bases be
closed. Police stood guard in front of the embassy compound but
there were no incidents.
   U.S. and Philippine officials described the opening session as
cordial.
   ``Both sides expressed their desire for a successful review and
pledged to work toward this end in a harmonious, business-like
manner,'' the two panels said in a joint statement.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, chief Filipino negotiator, has
called for substantial increases in the $180 million which Manila
receives annually for use of the six installations.
   Filipino officials say they will also press U.S. officials for
details of nuclear weapons that may be stored there and for
expanding the right to try American troops charged with criminal
offenses.
   The outcome of the talks, expected to last three months, will
determine whether the Philippines allows the bases to remain in the
nation after their lease expires in 1991.
   Under a new Filipino Constitution, a lease extension must be
approved by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to
the bases is strong.
   Platt has refused to say whether Washington will agree to a
major increase in lease payments. Last month, Manglapus suggested
U.S. payments of $1.2 billion for the bases.
   Platt noted today the presence of American troops enables the
Philippines to spend scarce resources on economic development
instead of defense.
   ``An overnight shift in Soviet intentions can transform this
presence into a serious economic and military threat to the
Philippines and the region,'' Platt said.
   He said the talks ``will lay the groundwork to create a positive
atmosphere for discussions to come later on the future of our
security relations.''
   The United States is the Philippines' chief weapons supplier in
the government's 19-year-old fight against communist rebels.
   Under the agreement, the United States maintains Clark Air Base,
Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations. About 20,000
U.S. troops and Defense Department workers are stationed at the
bases, which the United States says are crucial for defense of the
western Pacific.
   The bases are officially under Filipino command but are
effectively controlled by the United States.
   President Corazon Aquino has promised to let the bases remain
until 1991 but has refused to say whether she supports an extension.
   U.S. authorities say 40 percent of the warships that call at
Subic Bay are nuclear-powered.

   Michael Keaton's portrayal of a manic ghost in
``Beetlejuice'' had enough magic to take the top box office
position from ``Biloxi Blues,'' while ``Bright Lights, Big City''
took third place.
   The Easter weekend box office take was also a spring bonanza for
studios suffering through the winter moviegoing doldrums.
``Beetlejuice'' rung in more than $8 million for the No. 1 position.
   In doing so, it knocked ``Biloxi Blues,'' Neil Simon's nostalgic
look at 1945 Army life, down a notch. The Simon yarn, starring
Matthew Broderick as a boot camp private, made its debut at No.1 a
week earlier. Its $6 million take put it in second place.
   In third was ``Bright Lights, Big City,'' starring wholesome
``Family Ties'' TV star Michael J. Fox as a pathetic drug user in a
self-destructive relationship with a young model. It raked in $5
million in its first week of release.
   Movies geared toward youngsters made the best showing because of
the Easter week vacation from school, giving box offices a needed
boost after a lackluster winter season.
   ``It was a good overall gross, and `Beetlejuice' enjoyed the
biggest opening of the year, benefiting of course from the spring
break,'' said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., which tracks
studio box office performance.
   The Disney studios, leading the box office derby for months with
the blockbuster hits ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``Three Men and
a Baby,'' snagged three spots in the Top 10 this week.
   The studio's reissue of ``The Fox And The Hound'' took in $4
million for a two-week gross of almost $12 million and the No. 4
spot in the turnstile race.
   The frightful coming of the Apocalypse in ``The Seventh Sign,''
starring Demi Moore, was fifth with $3.76 million, and the college
football recruiting farce ``Johnny Be Good'' was sixth with $2.9
million.
   Moviegoers shelled out $2.8 million to catch Robin William's
Oscar-nominated performance as an irreverent Saigon disc jockey in
``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' putting it in seventh place.
   ``Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach'' was eighth with a
$2.2 million take, ``A New Life'' was ninth with $1.5 million and
Disney's ``D.O.A.'' was 10th with $1.4 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release and estimated production costs when available.

<HEAD>Thieves Steal Six Paintings By Miro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thieves broke into a museum today and
stole six works by Spanish surrealist painter Joan Miro.
   Officials of the Fundacion Miro museum in Barcelona said the
stolen works included oils, gouaches and pastels. ``The value of
the works is impossible to calculate,'' they said in a statement.
   The officials said the museum's night guard notified police
before dawn when he heard the sound of breaking glass.
   The officials believed two people were involved. The thieves
escaped before police arrived.
   The Barcelona-born Miro, who died in December 1983 at age 90,
formed part of an extraordinary generation of Spanish artists that
included Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. Miro was known worldwide
for his brilliantly colored surrealist paintings and huge
sculptures.

   Soviet authorities allowed 944 Jews to emigrate
last month, the highest monthly figure since July 1981, a
resettlement agency said today.
   It was the second straight monthly increase in emigration, the
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration reported. The agency said
723 Jews left the Soviet Union in February and 658 emigrated in
January.
   Last year, 8,011 Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union,
the highest number since 1981. There were only 943 such emigres in
1986.
   In March, 176 of the Soviet Jews arriving at a transit center in
Vienna, Austria, went to Israel, agency spokeswoman Regina Boucault
said.
   Recent emigration has remained far below the resettlement
program's peak in 1979, when 51,330 Jews were allowed to leave the
Soviet Union.
   More than 250,000 Jews have emigrated since the program began in
1971. In the early years, most emigres went to Israel. Recently,
most emigres have chosen to settle elsewhere.

   Burnt by a controversial services tax
last year, state lawmakers and Gov. Bob Martinez say they won't be
talking taxes during the 1988 legislative session opening today.
   Martinez came under heavy fire for his original support and
later flip-flop on the services tax, which would have raised $1
billion by taxing lawyers, lawn care, accounting and other
services. The unusual 5 percent levy was repealed in December after
much argument.
   The controversy was fueled by the state's plan to tax services
such as advertising across state lines. Publishers, broadcasters
and the hotel industry raised an outcry, and many groups threatened
to cancel Florida conventions before Martinez backed off and pushed
for alternatives.
   ``It'll be very helpful to talk about problems and not have that
all-consuming issue,'' Martinez said Monday.
   The first-term Republican won't have to look far for other
concerns. Shackled by budget and political restraints, Florida's
leaders face overcrowded prisons, congested highways and schools,
and an environment buckling under the pressure of 1,000 new
residents each day.
   ``It will be a real competition for funds this year,'' said
Education Commissioner Betty Castor, who wants nearly $1 billion in
additional appropriations to meet her department's needs in the
face of 67,000 new students in 1988-89.
   The state relies heavily on its sales tax on goods, which the
Legislature increased by one percentage point to 6 percent after it
repealed the services tax.
   Martinez said he hasn't found any of his GOP colleagues or
conservative Democrats in favor of new taxes this year.
   ``Maybe it's one of those situations where it's going to have to
get a lot worse before it gets better,'' Senate President John
Vogt, a Democrat, said Monday at the Florida TaxWatch annual
meeting. Vogt said his travels around the state have convinced him
that citizens don't want new taxes regardless of the ramifications
of not raising more revenue.

<TEXT>
   Suspected Sikh militants today killed a
senior member of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party in
northern India after he organized protests against Sikh violence,
the United News of India reported.
   The news agency said Vilayati Ram Katyal and his bodyguard were
killed by three suspected Sikh militants in the town of Kanpur, 235
miles southeast of New Delhi. Katyal, 53, was a member of the Uttar
Pradesh state legislature.
   UNI said he was targeted by the militants for organizing a
strike in Kanpur to protest of killings in nearby Punjab state,
where the militants are most active.
   In Punjab, three Sikhs were killed in separate attacks Monday
night, UNI said. The killings raise to 659 the number of people
killed in Punjab this year in the Sikh guerrilla war for a separate
homeland. Most of the victims have been moderate Hindus or Sikhs
opposed to demands for a separate Sikh state.
   The Kanpur attack was the first by Sikh gunmen outside Punjab
state this year. Last year, 29 people were killed in New Delhi in
attacks blamed on the militants.
   Sikhs form just 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are
in a majority in Punjab. Sikh militants have been fighting for a
separate state since 1983, claiming discrimination by the majority
Hindu community, which forms 80 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors have challenged the legality of
millionaire Victor Posner's sentence on tax-fraud charges, which
involves a $3 million contribution to the homeless instead of a
prison term.
   ``Laudable as the project envisioned by this court may be, we
submit it would disserve and cause disrespect for our system of
justice, and only emphasize that the rich can trade money for
liberty while the poor cannot,'' U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner said in
a motion filed Monday.
   ``Sadly, we are compelled to observe that this sentence is
illegal,'' the prosecutor said of the unusual punishment imposed
Feb. 12 by U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman. ``The law does not
allow an exchange of money for jail time even for the benefit of a
badly needed societal purpose.''
   Spellman said Monday he would have no comment on the motion and
was awaiting a response by Posner's attorneys.
   After Posner pleaded no contest to 10 tax fraud counts for
inflating the value of land donated to Miami Christian College,
Spellman ordered the industrialist to perform a $3 million project
to aid the homeless in south Florida and to pay $4 million in back
taxes, penalties and interest.
   Spellman, who also ruled Posner could not take a tax deduction
for the donation to the homeless and could not file for voluntary
bankruptcy, acknowledged when he imposed the sentence that its
legality might be questioned.
   ``If for some reason (the sentence) is ever challenged, this
court will, in fact, incarcerate Victor Posner,'' he said in
February.
   Kellner's five-page motion noted that Spellman said Posner would
go to prison if any of the sentencing conditions were violated but
``did not indicate what (the) sentence would otherwise have been.''
   In his motion, Kellner said he was ``duty-bound to call to this
court's attention the fact that this court does not have the power
to order a criminal defendant to make charitable contributions as a
condition of probation.''
   A hearing on Posner's plan for distribution of the $3 million
was set for Wednesday before Spellman.

   An Israeli army soldier who met with the PLO in
Europe was sentenced to 3{ years in prison for desertion and
assisting the enemy, a military official said today.
   A military tribunal found the soldier had not harmed Israel's
security, the official said. But the court saw the soldier's
contacts with the PLO as ``very grave'' and therefore sentenced him
to five years, 1{ years of which were suspended.
   Israel views the Palestine Liberation Organization as a
terrorist group. The maximum sentence in Israel for assisting the
enemy is 25 years.
   The soldier, whose name and rank were kept secret, deserted last
summer and went to Cyprus and then Europe, where he initiated
contacts with a member of Fatah, the main wing of the PLO headed by
Yasser Arafat, the military official said.
   The soldier later cut off contacts with the group, Israel army
radio said. He was missing from Israel for 42 days, the Haaretz
newspaper said.
   The soldier appealed his conviction to a military appeals court
but was denied, the military official said.

   U.S. District Judge Norman P. Ramsay on Monday also sentenced
Clarence Mitchell to two more years, to be served after his Wedtech

drug kingpin. Mitchell was fined $10,000.
   Michael Mitchell requested a postponement in the surrender date
so he could finish distributing some 200 cases from his law

   Clarence Mitchell asked for the delay until April 19 to allow
him to finish placing clients from his consulting business with

<TEXT>
   Officials of China's inland provinces indicated
today they are scrambling for development strategies of their own
now that the central government's emphasis is on building up the
coastal areas.
   Delegates from one western region suggested the first joint
ventures in China with the Soviet Union since a bitter 1960
political split.
   ``If the coastal policies are only looking to exports, how are
we in the west going to modernize?'' wondered Huang Baozhang, vice
chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, at a meeting of
the region's delegates to the National People's Congress.
   The congress, China's legislature, began a 20-day annual session
March 25. Foreign reporters were allowed today for the second time
to sit in on delegate discussion groups in the Great Hall of the
People.
   Many inland officials oppose the state's new strategy of
developing the coast into an export-producing center, fearing their
already backward regions will stay mired in poverty while the coast
becomes rich.
   However, coastal development is a pet project of Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang.
   Huang said his solution for Xinjiang was to increase inland
trade across the border with the Soviet Union, making Xinjiang into
an export center of its own.
   Xinjiang's chairman, Tomur Dawamat, invited the Soviets to enter
into joint ventures in his region. The Soviets have not had joint
ventures in China since the 1960 political split between the two
Communist giants. Moscow then called home thousands of technicians
and industrial experts who had been helping rebuild China's economy
from the devastation of World War II.
   Although political differences remain strong, China and the
Soviet Union have concluded several trade agreements in recent
years, and an unofficial cross-border trade flourishes in Xinjiang
and other remote regions. Last month, the two countries announced
plans to turn a hotel in Moscow into a joint venture.
   ``We and the Soviet people have the same hope, although we have
great political differences,'' Huang said. ``The people of both
countries hope to carry out many economic exchanges. We need some
Soviet products and they need some of ours. Both nations could
benefit.''
   Delegates from Heilongjiang province, which borders the Soviet
Union in northeast China, pressed similar proposals and won support
from Zheng Tuobin, minister of foreign economic relations and trade.
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted Zheng as saying trade
with the Soviet Union and other East bloc countries will increase
rapidly, and that provinces will be allowed to make some trade
arrangements directly without going through the central government.

   America evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham will
tour China this month, it was announced today. The 16-day trip will
be Graham's first visit to China.
   The Christian Tien Dao Publishing House said in a statement
issued in this British colony that Graham, a Southern Baptist,

13.
   Graham also will visit Huaiyan in China's eastern Jiangsu

   It said North Carolina preacher is scheduled to preach in
churches in Beijing and Shanghai.
   He will also address a meeting of pastors in Shanghai and meet
scholars in Shanghai and at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
in Beijing.
   The statement quoted Graham as saying he was going to China as a
``learner''
   ``It has been my desire to visit the country where my wife was
born... I especially want to learn more about the religous
situation in China in light of the vast changes that have been
taking there,'' he said.

   Israeli troops surrounded Arab
guerrillas trying to enter Israel from Lebanon and attacked them at
dawn's first light today, the army said. Two guerrillas were killed
and four soldiers were wounded.
   It was ninth penetration or attempted infiltration of Israel in
four and a half months, since a guerrilla on a hangglider coasted
into Israel and killed six Israeli soldiers before being shot to
death.
   Israel radio reported that Fatah, the main wing of the Palestine
Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat, claimed
responsibility for today's attempt. The radio said the guerrillas
apparently intended to take Israeli civilians as hostages.
   The army said troops initially spotted a band of guerrillas just
yards from the Israeli border near Kfar Yuval north of Kiryat
Shmona.
   ``The patrol opened fire at the terrorists who returned the fire
and threw grenades,'' an army spokesman said. ``The army surrounded
the band and, at first light of morning, attacked them.''
   The statement from the army did not say how many guerrillas were
involved or if any were captured or escaped. It said the guerrillas
intended to ``carry out a deadly attack.''
   The army said three Israeli soldiers suffered minor wounds and a
fourth was more seriously injured.
   The statement said troops found Kalishnikov rifles, a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher and dozens of hand grenades on
the bodies of the two.
   The Israeli military censor prevented publication of news of the
attempted infiltration for several hours.
   United Nations spokesman Timor Goksel, in a telephone interview
from south Lebanon, said a three-hour Israeli search operation
began around 2 a.m.
   ``There were a lot of ground soldiers. They dropped flares from
helicopters, lighting up the ground. Then there was machine-gun
fire,'' Goksel said.

<HEAD>Defense Files Motion To Supress Evidence In Friedland Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a former state senator claimed
he was suffering from the effects of being drugged and tortured
when he made statements to authorities on his return to this
country from foreign custody.
   David Friedland, who disappeared just before he was to go to
prison on a kickback conviction and spent two years on the lam, was
treated so badly by authorities in the Maldive Islands that he
began hallucinating the night before he was turned over to U.S.
officials, the attorneys say.
   ``Mr. Friedland hallucinated that the prophet Mohammed told him
to convert and he would be released,'' said a motion filed by the
lawyers last week.
   The motion, filed Thursday before Chief U.S. District Judge John
F. Gerry, seeks to suppress statements Friedland made to U.S.
agents en route from the Indian Ocean islands to the United States
in December 1987.
   Friedland does not remember being read his rights or waiving his
rights to an attorney during the flight, the motion said. It also
said the U.S. agents manipulated Friedland to obtain the statements.
   Defense attorneys also filed motions last week to dismiss 35 of
the 90 counts in a federal indictment charging Friedland with
masterminding a $20 million swindle of a pension fund.
   Friedland, 50, is scheduled to go on trial Sept. 7 on charges he
set up a bogus mortgage company in Florida to bilk the pension fund
of Teamsters Local 701 in North Brunswick.
   Court documents do not indicate the nature of the statements
Friedland allegedly made to U.S. Deputy Marshal Blair Deem and
Special Agent Thomas G. Sommero during the flight.
   First Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff declined comment
on the statements Monday but said they may be made public during a
May 13 pretrial hearing before Gerry.
   Friedland faked his death in a bogus scuba-diving accident in
September 1985, weeks before he was to be sentenced for a 1980
kickback conviction involving the same pension fund. An indictment
alleges Friedland, a disbarred attorney, engineered the second scam
while working as a government informant.
   In 26 months on the lam, Friedland traveled through Europe, Asia
and Africa before settling in the Maldives, where he ran a
scuba-diving business for 18 months using an alias.
   By the time he was placed in the custody of that country's
National Security Force on Dec. 12, Friedland had been named the
most wanted fugitive by the U.S. Marshal's office.
   While in foreign custody, Friedland was kept in a room with a
board for a mattress and an overflowing toilet, fed spoiled food,
injected with drugs and beaten when he tried to sleep, his
attorneys say.
   Officials there also gave him daily injections of Talacen, a
mild narcotic, and Valium, an anti-anxiety drug, laced his tea with
hallucinogenics, and gave him other drugs, the motion said.
   After 12 days in custody, ``due to complete lack of sleep,
substantial drug consumption, exhaustion and pain, Mr. Friedland
was mentally and physically exhausted,'' the motion said.
   While in this condition, Friedland was handed over to the U.S.
agents who escorted him back to the United States.
   Defense attorneys Peter Willis and John Yacovelle did not return
calls Monday.
   Attempts to contact Maldiven officials were unsuccessful. Calls
to the Maldiven consulate in New York were not returned.
   Friedland faces a maximum sentence of seven years in prison for
his disappearance and up to 150 years in prison if convicted of
charges stemming from the second pension fund case.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors in the murder trial of an
airline pilot accused of killing his wife and disposing of parts of
her body with a woodchipper tried to prove the woman is dead by
noting it was out-of-character for her not to stay in touch with
her mother.
   Helle Crafts, a flight attendant for Pan American World Airways,
was last seen Nov. 18, 1986, when friends drove her to her Newtown
home after a flight from West Germany. Her body has never been
found, and her husband, Richard B Crafts, 50, was charged with her
murder.
   Mrs. Crafts' mother, Elisabeth Nielsen of Horsholm, Denmark,
testified Monday that her daughter had written letters to her every
two to three weeks and called her once every week or two.
   Testifying through an interpreter, Mrs. Nielsen said her last
contact with her daughter was a telephone call on Nov. 17, 1986.
   Mrs. Nielsen was the first witness called by State's Attorney
Walter Flanagan in a trial expected to last six to eight weeks.
   The state also produced a revealing letter the woman's daughter
had sent Mrs. Nielsen in October 1986.
   In the letter, read by the interpreter after the jury was
ordered out of the courtroom, Mrs. Crafts told her mother she had
informed her husband that she wanted a divorce and that he was
``seemingly not happy about the idea.''
   Superior Court Judge Barry Schaller ruled that the part of the
letter purporting to describe Crafts' reactions could not be
admitted into evidence.
   But a portion of the letter in which Mrs. Crafts said she no
longer trusted her husband apparently will be allowed into
evidence, and Flanagan said he was pleased with the judge's
decision.
   The prosecution was dealt a blow before the trial began when the
judge ruled that a clump of wood chips and human tissue seized from
Crafts' car could not be used against him.
   The chief state medical examiner issued a death certificate
based on the tissue found in the trunk and some body fragments,
including a dental cap and a finger tip, police said they found
along the Housatonic River near Newtown.
   Schaller held that authorities lacked the proper legal grounds
to seize Crafts' vehicle.
   Defense attorney J. Daniel Sagarin said he was disappointed the
judge did not also order the suppression of evidence seized from
Crafts' home, which included carpet samples, a comforter and a pair
of men's shoes.
   The judge also ordered the sequestering of all potential
witnesses except the principal investigators for the state and the
defense.
   The ruling brought an objection from Arthur Herzog, a New York
author who has a contract to write a book on the case and a film
script.

   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile today called
for the two top defense officials to resign over the escape of the
leader of the bloody August coup attempt.
   Enrile said Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos and armed forces
Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa showed ``negligence and
ineptness'' in allowing the escape of former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan. Honasan fled a military prison boat Saturday
with 14 guards.
   At a breakfast forum today, Enrile said he had not sheltered
Honasan at his beach house. Honasan served as military security
chief when Enrile was defense minister. Enrile was fired from that
post in November 1986.
   Honasan, leader of the Aug. 28 failed coup against President
Corazon Aquino, escaped from the ship where he had been held since
his capture in December. The August coup attempt left 53 people
dead and hundreds wounded.
   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said today a
nationwide search had turned up no significant leads on Honasan's
whereabouts.
   But Florendo said three soldiers missing since Monday from an
air force detention center had surrendered and were in custody. All
four had been jailed in connection with coup attempts.
   Florendo said Capt. Fernando Logro, Capt. Jesus Sampol, and Sgt.
Dante Anggulo gave up to military authorities, who found them at
their homes in three provinces south of Manila.
   The spokesman said a fourth soldier, Lt. Belarmino Munar,
remained missing. A private radio station, DZRH, quoted air force
authorities as saying Munar had fled to Los Angeles with his wife
on March 21, the day he escaped.
   Enrile also renewed charges today that government troops raided
his beach house near Manila in search of Honasan. The military,
however, has denied it conducted a raid.
   ``If it is proven that I had something to do with the escape of
Honasan and ... that I know where he is, I will resign,'' Enrile
said. ``But they, de Villa and Ramos, should also resign for
negligence and ineptness.''
   Enrile urged journalists to ignore a government ban on
interviews with Honasan. He offered his services as lawyer to
journalists who might be prosecuted for violating the ban.
   Meanwhile, Honasan's wife Jane sent Mrs. Aquino a letter today
asking for the creation of an independent, civilian body to
investigate Honasan and others involved in the attempted coup.
   Mrs. Honasan accused the government of prejudging her husband's
case. Mrs. Aquino and Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez have
described the escape as an ``admission of guilt'' and called
Honasan ``an enemy of the state.''
   Honasan's wife described the escape as ``a sudden
disappearance'' and added, ``as a wife and mother, I fear for his
health and safety.''
   Enrile and Ramos led the military revolt that helped oust
Ferdinand Marcos and bring Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986.
Enrile later broke with Mrs. Aquino.

<HEAD>Pravda Accuses Gorbachev Opponents of Renewing Stalinism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda today accused
opponents of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms of trying to bring back
Stalinism and told other publications that there are limits to what
they should print.
   In a major full-page article, the authoritative newspaper said
papers should not print material that undermines Gorbachev's
efforts to reform the economy and to allow freer discussion of some
issues.
   Pravda said the Soviet Union needs people who are dedicated to
improving housing, food supplies and services, not people obsessed
with uncovering suspected enemies, as was Stalin.
   ``A patriot is not he who cries out loudly about an alleged
`internal threat' to socialism, who joining with a few political
extremists seeks internal enemies everywhere,'' Pravda said.
   ``A patriot is he who acts in the interest of the country, of
the people, without fear of any difficulty,'' the newspaper said.
   Pravda's article appeared to be an effort to strengthen
Gorbachev's hand going into an unusual June Communist Party
conference and an indication that the Soviet leader still faces
stiff conservative resistance. The conference gives Gorbachev the
possibility of replacing opponents with his supporters to
strengthen support for his policies.
   The article was written as a criticism of a letter by Leningrad
teacher Nina Andreyeva defending Stalin and published by the
newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya on March 13.
   The Soviet press in the last year has sharply criticized
Stalin's excesses, and Gorbachev in November said the dictator's
guilt for the purges in which millions died was ``enormous and
unforgivable.'' However, he defended Stalin's rapid
industrialization and collectivization of agriculture.
   Pravda echoed Gorbachev's criticism, but said his opponents
won't let the issue rest either because they feel more comfortable
with Stalin's repressive ways or because it serves their personal
interest.
   ``In one person this may be directed at taking more and giving
less, in another in wrapping in respectable clothes their efforts
to claim a monopoly in science, personal innocence or something
else,'' Pravda said.
   It criticized Stalin's system as ``thoughtless execution of
orders and suppression of initiative.'' It said the Soviet Union
cannot hide from the fact that ``many thousands'' of party workers,
economic and military officials, scientists and cultural figures
were exiled or killed by Stalin.
   Gorbachev embarked on ``perestroika'' _ his effort to
restructure Soviet society _ at a meeting of the Central Committee
in April 1985. Pravda said his opponents are concerned that the
reforms will undermine the principles of the Soviet system.
   ``Not all realize fully that the administrative-command methods
have exhausted themselves. All who pin hopes on those methods or
their modifications would do well to wake up to the fact that we
have had that more than once, but it did not bring about the
desired results,'' Pravda said.
   Pravda said the letter in Sovietskaya Rossiya was ``an attempt,
little by little, to revise party decisions.''
   ``At meetings at the party Central Committee it has been said
more than once that the Soviet press is not a private shop and that
the Communists writing in the press and the editors should be aware
of their responsibility for the articles and the publications.''
   ``In this case the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya ... has
departed from this principle,'' Pravda said.
   It said the press should publish criticism that will help
supporters of the restructuring to unite their forces, rather than
articles that encourage disunity.

<HEAD>Carter Says He Never Heard of Plan to Swap Military Parts for
Hostages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Carter says he never
heard of a plan to swap military parts for the 52 Americans held
hostage in Iran during the last year of his term.
   ``No one that I have talked to had heard of it,'' he added at a
news conference Monday night following a speech at Fresno State
University.
   Newly declassified documents revealed in a House Judiciary
subcommittee investigation showed the Carter administration
considered offering $10 million in military spare parts to Iran for
the hostages captured in November 1979 during an attack on the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran.
   Carter advisers scuttled the plan after determining arms dealer
Houshang Lavi didn't have the backing of then-Iranian president
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, according to documents obtained by the Miami
Herald.
   One CIA memo said Lavi offered to make a hostage exchange and
handed over a seven-page list of F-14 parts. The CIA officer who
wrote the memo recommended against pursuing the deal.
   Carter said he never saw any of the memos and that the plan was
``never seriously considered.''
   The documents include CIA memos to Carter's National Security
Council chief David Aaron and State Department memos by then-Deputy
Assistant Secretary Harold Saunders.
   The papers surfaced during a hearing being held by Rep. John
Coyers, D-Mich., into attempts by the Reagan administration to
trade arms with Iran for hostages seized by Iran-backed Shiite
Moslems in Lebanon.
   During his speech, Carter said the United States doesn't always
use its power as it should to promote human rights.
   ``When there is a silence from Washington, there is a worldwide
silence,'' he said. ``What the oppressed fear most is a silence
from Washington.''
   Carter, whose policy as president was to publicly criticize
nations that abused human rights, told the crowd that the Reagan
administration has been ``on the wrong side of human rights issues
in almost every case.''
   He urged that the next president develop a foreign policy that
would ``alleviate suffering by the use of American influence.''

   Two English teen-agers clung to bushes
while four hiking companions slid and fell hundreds of feet to
their deaths on a snowy Alpine mountain, police said today.
   The four died Monday after the group strayed off a hiking trail
for horseplay on the side of the 6,500-foot peak near Salzburg,
according to police.
   The six hikers left Untersberg on Monday on a set path but
wandered off to slide on the snow, according to air rescue official
Norbert Huber.
   Four of them lost control, dropped 330 feet into a gully, and
then fell over a rocky cliff, said Salzburg police spokesman Alois
Wintersteller.
   Authorities identified the victims as Andrew Powell-Lee, 15;
Andrew Watts, 14; Michael Taylor, 13; and Daniel Howton, 14.
   The survivors were identified as Thomas Plumridge, 14; and
Richard Davis, 15.
   The group came to Austria with other pupils of Altwood Church of
England school at Maidenhead, west of London.
   The Austria Press Agency said the group was likely to leave
Austria for home today, abandoning earlier plans to travel on to
Switzerland from Salzburg.

<TEXT>
   Officers shot to death a man they said was a
suspect in a gang-related drive-by killing and two men were wounded
in still another drive-by incident as violent gang confrontations
continued, police said.
   Monday's fatal shooting took place on the same day Police Chief
Darryl Gates unveiled plans to have 1,000 officers work four hours
of overtime each to fight gang warfare, and Mayor Tom Bradley said
he would support whatever measures are needed to take back control
of the city's streets.
   Police said a 19-year-old man, whose name was withheld pending
notification of relatives, was shot to death when he allegedly
reached for his waistband as two officers attempted to take him
into custody.
   The officers believed the man was reaching for a handgun, but no
gun was found, Lt. William Hall, who heads the Police Department's
officer-involved shooting unit, said Monday. He would not say if
Officers Harold Moberly, 33, and Larry Maillet, 31, were under
investigation.
   Police said the man was suspected of participating in a drive-by
shooting earlier Monday in which a 27-year-old man, whose name also
was withheld, was killed by a shotgun blast while standing with a
group of people on the city's gang-ridden southwest side.
   Gennaire Harris, 19, who was with the man killed by the
officers, was arrested for investigation of murder, Hall said.
   Two other young men were listed in stable condition at area
hospitals today after being shot Monday night in another
gang-related drive-by shooting, police said. The gunmen escaped.
   Meanwhile, the Police Department will ask for $150,000 to
$200,000 from the City Council this week to pay for overtime
salaries, Gates said at a news conference Monday.
   ``We are determined to take back the streets of Los Angeles and
restore them to the decent, law-abiding citizens of this
community,'' Bradley said in support. ``Whatever that takes, I am
prepared to back the Police Department and the chief of police in
that effort.''
   Gang violence has long been a problem, but a drive-by shooting
on Good Friday that killed one person and wounded a dozen,
including a 4-year-old boy, triggered new calls for action.
   The assault may have been the city's worst in terms of the
number of victims, police said. Five people were killed and five
others injured in a gang shooting outside a home in October 1984.
   A police task force converged on gang areas Saturday night and
early Sunday, arresting 175 people for investigation of a variety
of alleged offenses and interrogating 619 people, 500 of them
believed to be gang members.
   In nine sweeps since February, 1,203 people have been arrested,
of which 996 were gang members, Gates said.
   Gates declined to say which day the expanded force would be
deployed, saying he didn't want to tip his hand to the gangs.
   ``We'll do it long enough that they get the message,'' Gates
said.
   Gates also proposed the use of wiretaps against gangs, which
Bradley said he supported.
   Gates said he did not believe the city needed the National
Guard's help now, but he added, ``maybe sometime down the road it
will become necessary.'' Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn
has called on Gov. George Deukmejian to dispatch the Guard.
   In a separate move, the mayor Monday also proposed a plan for
spending $2.8 million to hire unarmed rangers and improve
facilities at 66 parks, mostly in the inner city, where gangs have
forced out park users.

<HEAD>Study Urges Development of Leaner Meats and Dairy Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans eat too much animal fat and the
government should rewrite its regulations to encourage the
production of leaner meats and dairy products, the National
Research Council said today.
   The council, in a report on a 2{-year study, said that despite a
decline in fat consumption in recent years, Americans' dietary
habits still center too heavily on meat and dairy products rich in
animal fats, which can cause a variety of health problems.
   ``The nutrition-related health problems experienced by a large
segment of the U.S. population today arise from overconsumption of
fat, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol,'' the report said.
   For other Americans, the report added, dietary problems center
on not getting enough calories, iron or calcium. Overall, the
report said, ``The incidence of nutrition-related health problems
is significant, affecting either directly or indirectly nearly
every American family.''
   Among the diet-related health problems cited are:
   _About 34 million Americans are overweight.
   _Nearly a million adults die annually of cardiovascular disease
that may be related to the consumption of high-cholesterol foods.
   _Osteoporosis, a disease caused by the leaching of calcium from
bone, strikes 15 to 20 million adults.
   _From eight and 12 million children are hungry due to inadequate
diets.
   _Iron deficiency is the most common form of childhood anemia.
   The study said that the present system of government regulations
in the meat industry tends to put more animal fat on American
tables.
   ``The present grading system for retail meats is not only costly
and inefficient but it encourages the overfattening of beef and
lamb,'' the report said. ``Trimming of fat at slaughter or at
purchase is only a partial, short-term response. The real solution
lies in the production of leaner animals.''
   Among the recommendations made in the study were that the
Agriculture Department permit the removal of fat from carcasses
immediately after slaughter, a system called ``hot fat trimming.''
   This, in effect, would penalize meat producers for additional
fat in the carcasses, the report said.
   An Agriculture Department spokesman said that ``hot fat
trimming'' has been proposed and now is under study by the industry.
   The study also recommended that ways be found to reduce the
cholesterol in animal products, to identify the fat and protein
content of live animals and carcasses, and to reduce the fat and
fatty acid ratios of meat, milk and eggs through breeding or
feeding programs. Ways also should be found, the report said, to
reduce the amount of salt contained in prepared meats and meat
products.
   Additionally, the study said that the Food and Drug
Administration should establish standards for such terms as
``natural'' and that the USDA restrict use of the terms ``light'',
``lite'' and ``lean'' to ``some objective standard'' for cuts of
meat. The terms then would apply to specific nutrient content and
identify levels of fat in meat and other products.

<HEAD>Newborn Baby Rescued From Bag on South African River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWCASTLE, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fisherman rescued a newborn
from a plastic trash bag floating on a river after hearing the baby
crying, police said today.
   The baby, whom police called ``Moses,'' was wrapped in newspaper
with his umbilical cord still attached when he was found Monday,
according to police.
   He was in satisfactory condition today at Newcastle hospital
about 180 miles southeast of Johannesburg.
   The air in the sealed bag had kept it afloat and saved the life
of the baby, born about an hour before it was rescued, according to
police Lt. Pieter van Straaten.
   Officials said the child had a light complexion, brown hair, and
could be Indian or mixed-race.
   Jan Bekker, 27, and Anton Venter, 19, were fishing on the shore
of the Ncandu River on the outskirts of Newcastle when they saw the
trash bag floating downstream. They heard cries but thought at
first they came from the opposite bank, the South African Press
Association reported.
   When the bag got stuck in reeds near shore about 30 yards from
the fishermen, they realized the cries were coming from inside, the
news agency said.
   Venter, a bank clerk with an artificial leg, took off his
clothes and swam across the swiftly flowing river, opened the bag
and found the baby, van Straaten said.
   The news agency said Venter tied off the umbilical cord with
catgut and cut it. The two men then rushed the child to the
hospital.
   The agency quoted police as saying the baby could have been
dropped into the river from a bridge along the main
Johannesburg-Newcastle Highway.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Charged With Murder in Killing of Man Outside His
Bedroom Window</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old high school student who
shot through a window and killed a man he thought was breaking into
his bedroom has been charged with murder.
   James Ronald Sutton remained in Spartanburg County Jail for the
second night Monday without bond. City authorities had recommended
a low bond, but a circuit judge was not in town Monday to set bond,
as required in a murder charge.
   Sutton, a 10th grader at Spartanburg High School with no
previous record, called police late Sunday night to report he had
shot a man he believed was trying to break into his house,
Spartanburg Police Lt. Charles Wolfe said.
   Sutton told police a man came to the house while he was asleep
and rang the doorbell for about four minutes at 11:40 p.m., but the
youth did not answer, Wolfe said.
   A short time later, Sutton told police he heard the screen being
taken off his bedroom window. He then loaded a 20-gauge shotgun,
looked through the window and saw someone, Wolfe said.
   Sutton then sat on the bed and fired a shot through the window,
Wolfe said.
   ``He said he was very afraid,'' the officer said.
   Coroner Jim Burnett identified the dead man as Freddie Edward
Dawkins Jr., 22, of Spartanburg. Dawkins, who was unarmed, was shot
once through the neck, Burnett said.
   Police records showed Dawkins had several prior convictions and
a charge of common law robbery filed in October was pending when he
was killed.
   Sutton's arrest angered his mother, Irene Jones, who said
Monday: ``I feel they shouldn't have arrested him like that and
charged him with murder. He was frightened. He was afraid in his
bedroom.''
   She said the charges against her son contrasted with the
treatment given an 11-year-old youth in Switzer, 10 miles south of
Spartanburg, who shot and killed two intruders in the family home
last month. Officials in that case didn't charge the youth.
   Wolfe wouldn't comment on the Switzer case except to say the
intruders in that case were inside the home.
   ``We charged him (Sutton) for technical reasons,'' Wolfe said.
``Any time a life is taken, the normal procedure is to charge
somebody, even if it's a police officer who did the shooting.''
   Wolfe said the action would allow the courts to clear the youth
of any wrongdoing.

   A machinist with three children in college found
and returned a bag containing $10,400 in cash and checks and
accepted a $100 reward only with great reluctance.
   ``It was a miracle that Joe Washko happened along,'' said Larry
Hyzer, a manager of Southgate Auto Parts. One of the store's
workers, Bill Sovia, lost the satchel Thursday en route to a bank.
   ``Not many people would have done what he did,'' Hyzer said.
``He wouldn't even take $100 until I begged him to.''
   Washko, 55, of the Detroit suburb of Lincoln Park, said he saw
the pouch on his way to a store and thought it was a child's school
bag.
   ``It was something seeing all those hundreds and fifties, but
there was never any question in my mind on what to do with it,'' he
said. Washko identified the owner through checks in the bag.
   Washko said he would put the reward toward his children's
educations.
   ``The look on the manager's face made my family and me feel
pretty wonderful,'' he said. ``We knew he had a rough afternoon.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today ordered a 43-year-old art dealer
held on espionage charges after a prosecutor said he was caught
contacting a foreign power on radio equipment in his north London
apartment.
   Erwin van Haarlem, who has a Dutch passport but says he is
Czechoslovak, was ordered held until his next court appearance May
3 after the brief hearing under tight security at Bow Street
Magistrate's Court.
   Van Haarlem was charged under section seven of Britain's
Official Secrets Act, which deals with the prosecution of people
suspected of preparing to set up a spying operation.
   The allegation was that he ``recorded and ciphered information
and was in possession of equipment to decipher that information,''
police said. No further details were given.
   Prosecutor Michael Bibby said van Haarlem was arrested while
``making direct contact with a foreign power and that transmitting
equipment was found in his possession.''
   Police, after keeping watch on the apartment, arrested van
Haarlem on Saturday. They removed boxes and bags of files and other
materials from the apartment where he lived alone.
   British press reports said van Haarlem was suspected of being a
Czechoslovak secret agent working for the Soviet Union.
   London's Daily Express said Monday that van Haarlem was
suspected of being part of a Soviet-run international spy ring
seeking secrets of underwater weapons development and submarines,
in which Britain is a world leader.
   The Daily Express said the Soviets wanted to know how NATO
tracked Soviet submarines heading into the Atlantic Ocean from
their base at Kola near Murmansk on the Barents Sea.
   Marconi, a British electronics company, plays a major role in
the development of submarine technology.
   In court, the prosecutor told magistrate Ronald Bartle that van
Haarlem claimed to be Czechoslovak despite having a Dutch passport,
and police said his nationality was ``not absolutely clear.''
   Van Haarlem sat impassively during the three-minute hearing. He
was not asked to plead and did not seek bail.
   British newspapers reported that MI5, Britain's counterespionage
secret service, ordered van Haarlem's arrest after investigating
more than six months, including by plainclothes police.
   Neighbors said a team of five men and a woman had occupied an
apartment overlooking van Haarlem's for more than six months and
had been seen carrying in what looked like electronic equipment.
   The Times daily newspaper today quoted two former high-ranking
Czechoslovak officials who have defected to the West as saying that
improved diplomatic relations had enabled Czechoslovaks spying for
the Soviet Union to penetrate high-level British circles.
   The report quoted former Czechoslovak News Agency head Antonin
Buzek and Josef Frolik, a former major in the Czechoslovak secret
police.

   An American who says he was duped into
carrying cocaine into Spain was sentenced to six years and a day in
prison for drug trafficking, a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in
Barcelona said today.
   Peter Cecere, the consulate spokesman, said Conan Owen was
convicted of smuggling 4.13 pounds of cocaine into Barcelona's El
Prat Airport on March 13, 1987 in a false-bottomed suitcase.
   Owen, a 23-year-old freelance photographer from Annandale, Va.,
stood trial March 26 after spending more than a year in pre-trial
detention at Barcelona's Modelo Prison.
   During the one-day trial, Judge Jose Presencia Rubio refused to
admit evidence defense lawyers said would clear Owen. A
three-member tribunal heard the case.

<HEAD>Hunter Agrees to Turn Himself In For Killing Mother Bear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSCOMMON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hunter suspected of illegally shooting
a mother bear and leaving her three cubs in a trash bin has agreed
to turn himself in, authorities said.
   An arrest warrant was issued Monday for the 27-year-old Bay City
man, who agreed to appear today for arraignment, Crawford County
Prosecutor John Huss said.
   The two-count warrant accuses the man of illegally killing a
bear and of unlawfully possessing a bear or parts of a bear.
   The man has said he killed the black bear in self-defense, but
Department of Natural Resources law enforcement chief Herb Burns
said that's unlikely.
   ``Our evidence points to this being a deliberate shooting and
not the result of a bear attack on the individual,'' he said in a
statement Monday.
   ``The parts he possessed were the head and the paws,'' said
Huss, adding that he didn't know the reason they were taken. ``I
guess it's like a bullfighter. They take the ears, right?''
   The head and claws were found in the suspect's residence after
the DNR received a tip on its poaching hotline, said Lt. Jay Larson
of the DNR office in Mio.
   Killing a bear illegally is a misdemeanor, which carries fines
ranging from $200 to $1,000, a mandatory five-day jail sentence
extending to up to 90 days, $1,500 in restitution for the animal
and a three-year loss of hunting privileges. Illegal bear
possession carries the same penalties, Huss said.
   Last week, the suspect led wildlife officials to the bear
carcass in a swamp in the Au Sable State Forest in the northern
Lower Peninsula. He said he found the bear's cubs after he shot her
and left them in a trash container, according to the department.
   A conservation officer rescued the two male and one female cubs
March 24 after someone called a wildlife office and said he found
the three bears in the trash container, in rural Crawford County.
The caller told officers he would leave the cubs in a telephone
booth.
   Barb Rogers, who is taking care of the 2-month-old cubs at the
Wildlife Recovery Association in Midland, has said they cannot
survive in the wild because they have been handled by humans.
   Tom Monaghan, owner of the Detroit Tigers baseball club and
Domino's Pizza, has offered to adopt the cubs and give them a home
on a Domino's retreat on Drummond Island in the Upper Peninsula. A
DNR official said he hoped the department would be able to turn the
cubs over to the retreat within a week.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson's Race Draws New Attention Abroad</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

   This is one of a series of periodic reports
compiled by Associated Press bureaus on how the U.S. presidential
election campaign is viewed abroad.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   More than any other Democratic candidate, foreign commentators
are focusing more and more attention on Jesse Jackson's drive for
his party's presidential nomination. Here is some of what they had
to say most recently:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ZIMBABWE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Herald of Harare (government-controlled): ``A black
american, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, has for the first time in
United States history emerged a front-runner. ...
   ``Some see it as a divisive force, weakening his party's bid for
the presidency and, ultimately, if Jackson does win the Democratic
ticket, reducing the choice of president to a black versus white
affair, exacerbating old racial wounds and very probably opening
new ones. ...
   ``It would be starry-eyed to give Jackson anything but an
outside chance of the White House. But it would be remiss of the
next administration to ignore the significance of his challenge.
Jackson's dreams are those of many Americans, black and white.
   ``They want new direction. And while domestic issues are bound
to dominate, the call extends to a foreign policy so confused that
while rushing to impose sanctions on Panama it stubbornly refuses
to back full economic sanctions against apartheid.
   ``It is how far Jackson's challenge eventually goes towards
reshaping America's dealings with others that has the world's
attention as the presidential race progresses.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _South African Broadcasting Corp. (government-controlled), in a
commentary predicting the election of Vice President George Bush in
November: ``As it did in the last election, the Democratic Party
seems intent once again on contesting the presidency with a man who
has virtually no chance of winning against the Republican
candidate. ... This year they seem determined to nominate in Mr.
Jesse Jackson, a candidate who even Democratic Party leaders admit
is unelectable.
   ``Nobody likes to say it out loud, but the Jackson phenomenon
and the dilemma it has created for the party are almost entirely a
matter of racism in America. Both his present leadership position
in the party primaries and the impossibility of his being elected
president are due first and foremost to the fact that Mr. Jackson
is black.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Carl Noffke, director of the Institute for American Studies at
Rand Afrikaans University, speaking to the South African Institute
of International Affairs, as quoted in The Citizen of Johannesburg
(pro-government): ``The elevation of the Rev. Jesse Jackson to a
position of leadership presents a considerable crisis to the
(Democratic) party. Because of the color of his skin, his opponents
will do everything humanly possible to try to prove that they are
not racists.
   ``One can therefore expect an increase in anti-South African
sentiments in the coming months, in the same way in which South
Africa became the political whipping boy of the 1984 presidential
elections, when the Democrats were divided.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Financial Times of London (independent): ``Mr. Jackson's
strength could transcend racial boundaries. More than any other
candidate from either party, he is talking about issues that affect
the common man and woman. The Reagan years may have created more
wealth for many Americans but they have not much reduced the
underclass, which cuts across color lines. This constituency, no
longer the automatic fiefdom of the Democrats and now poorly
represented by the trade union movement, is there to be galvanized.
...
   ``So, if it is up to George Bush to prove, in the wider arena,
that he is not Ronald Reagan, it is up to the Democratic Party to
find room for Jesse Jackson, and he has not yet begun to bargain.
It is debatable which challenge is the more daunting.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Independent of London (independent): ``The way is now clear
for a Bush nomination. ... The disarray in the Democratic camp is
just what the White House doctor ordered. The traditional wisdom is
that another liberal, ethnic ticket, weighed down with Jacksonian
baggage, would be tantamount to electoral suicide for the
Democrats. Yet that is what appears to be forming.''

<TEXT>
   ``Shirley,'' a 25-pound male
lobster with claws as big as baseball mitts, returned to the ocean
today, saved from a dinner plate by animal rights activists, a
seafood vendor and state officials.
   Lifting the giant crustacean by its claws and tail, seafood
dealers from Portland and Philadelphia gently swung him over the
side of a Maine Marine Patrol boat into 22-feet-deep water near
fog-shrouded Portland Head Light in this Portland suburb.
   Bob, a companion lobster weighing in at 19} pounds, was dropped
into the water moments later.
   Dana Neuts, retail manager of Harbor Fish Market in Portland,
said he wasn't used to the idea of returning potential seafood to
the sea, but in the case of Shirley and Bob he had no complaints.
   ``It feels great. It really does,'' Neuts said. ``I like the
idea of the whole thing.''
   ``These are well-traveled lobsters,'' said Kevin Hill, the
Philadelphia seafood vendor who accompanied Shirley and Bob on
their flight to Portland on Monday. ``We shouldn't be catching
lobsters this size. Maine is the only state that's doing anything
to protect them, and that's why we're here.''
   The two lobsters spent the night in a 12-by-4-foot tank in
Neuts' market along the Portland waterfront before being placed
aboard the 35-foot boat for the half-hour ride through choppy seas
to a protected cove off Cape Elizabeth.
   Shirley, whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old,
and her smaller companion were rescued from a Philadelphia man who
wanted to serve them for Easter dinner.
   ``This is symbolic of what we're trying to do and what citizens
are trying to do for a natural, sustainable resource,'' said Col.
Robert Fogg, chief of the Bureau of Marine Patrol of the state
Department of Marine Resources. ``By protecting these large
lobsters, there's more of a chance of them reproducing'' and
perpetuating the industry.
   ``It shows there's a lot of concern about our natural resources
out there,'' Fogg added.
   Maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds.
   The Marine Patrol said the two lobsters appeared to be in
``excellent'' shape after their flight and enjoyed a seafood dinner
in their tank at the Portland fish market.
   ``They were real frisky,'' said Officer Donald K. Lockhart Jr.
``They put a quahog in there and the big one just snapped it up
like it was butter. They left a crab in there overnight and it was
gone this morning.''
   The lobsters had been trucked from Long Island, N.Y., to
Philadelphia, where they were sold to a customer for $287.
   Animal rights activists took up the lobsters' cause when they
heard that Art Miller, a retired carpenter, planned to use them for
a feast.
   Hill, owner of Hill's Main Line Seafood Co. in the Philadelphia
suburb of Ardmore, persuaded Miller to take 45 pounds of smaller
lobsters instead.
   Hill put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their
visit to Philadelphia's Main Line, acknowledging that saving
lobsters from dinner was something new for him.
   ``It's been very good for business,'' he said. Thousands of
people dropped by for a look at Shirley. ``If they don't buy now,
at least they know where we are,'' said Hill.
   Pity Not Cruelty Inc., a small animal rights group, made
arrangements with Maine officials to turn the creatures loose and
assumed the $40 flight cost.
   It may seem a lot of trouble for a couple of lobsters, but group
vice president Gloria Felscher-Cohen makes no apologies.
   ``Why not?'' she asked. ``These two lobsters have survived
hazards, particularly Shirley, over 100 years. Why should she need
to succumb to the cruelest predator of all, man?''

<HEAD>Simon Future Hinges on Wisconsin Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois said today he will
look at the Wisconsin primary results and decide whether to
continue his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Simon aides said many options already have been discussed,
including suspending the campaign rather than quitting in order to
hold onto the national convention delegate he has won.
   ``We're going to do well tonight. If we don't do well, we have
to make a re-evaluation,'' Simon told reporters outside an
unemployment office in downtown Milwaukee. ``We'll take one step at
a time.''
   Pre-primary polls put Simon a distant fourth in the Democratic
primary race here, where Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson were the front-runners. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee is in third place in the polls.
   Simon spokesman Terry Michael said that Simon would have no
statement on the Wisconsin results tonight or Wednesday. If Simon
makes a statement on his campaign, it will come on Thursday,
Michael said.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reports in today's editions that Simon
would suspend his campaign, but not withdraw, in order to hold onto
his delegates. A key to such a decision would be the 47 at-large
delegates Simon has won in the state, but which will not be
selected until the state convention in May.
   If Simon withdraws before the convention, Jackson, the
second-place finisher in Illinois, would win all 60 at-large
delegates, not just the 13 he is currently allocated.
   ``Anybody can see that's an option,'' said Michael, even as he
firmly denied it was the course Simon had chosen to take.
   Simon has won only one contest, his homestate primary on March
15. He skipped the Super Tuesday primaries to focus on Illinois and
then said he would make a major effort in Wisconsin to revive his
campaign.
   But Simon failed to catch on in Wisconsin, although he has
campaigned hard around the state. His aides talked privately only
of coming in third, ahead of Gore, a finish far short of anything
strong enough to keep Simon in the race.

<TEXT>
   A power fluctuation dimmed lights in
Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and parts of South Dakota and was blamed
for a radioactive gas leak at a Colorado electric plant.
   Mark Severts, spokesman for Public Service Co. of Colorado in
Denver, said the radiation leak Monday posed no danger to the
public or plant workers.
   Severts said 0.3 curies, or less than one-thousandth of the
concentration PSC is authorized to release on a scheduled basis,
was released at Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station near
Platteville as a result of the power disturbance.
   ``It's no big deal,'' he said, adding that PSC notified the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the state Health Department as
required.
   PSC temporarily closed the plant, as well as one of two
generating units at its Comanche plant near Pueblo.
   Dennis Eyre, administration manager for the Western Systems
Coordinating Council, said utility employees in the affected states
were working to discover the cause.
   ``There was a power system component malfunction'' that caused
electricity to be shifted from one line to another line, he said.
That in turn triggered the fluctuation, which he said lasted ``a
few seconds.''
   He said power went out completely for a brief period in portions
of Wyoming, but in most of the affected area power levels were only
reduced.
   In Wyoming, Rick Kaysen, customer service manager for Cheyenne
Light, Fuel and Power Co., said he had not heard of any major
difficulties related to the fluctuation.
   ``I thought someone was playing with the lights,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Every pensioner's nightmare is unfolding
here for nearly 6,000 Social Security recipients _ the Postal
Service has lost or mislaid their checks.
   ``These checks could be sitting in any number of post offices
around the country,'' said Bruce Sanders, manager of quality
control for the Postal Service in Kansas City, Mo.
   Checks totaling at least $3 million were delivered from the U.S.
Treasury's regional financial center in Kansas City, Kan., to the
main post office in Kansas City, Mo., according to Jack Adams,
director of the regional center.
   The checks for 5,800 to 5,900 residents of southwest Indiana
were to be sent by plane to Louisville, Ky., and then trucked to
Evansville. But they never made it to Kentucky and are no longer in
Kansas City, Sanders said Monday.
   The checks were placed in eight trays presorted by zip codes,
Adams said, declining to speculate how the trays were lost.
   ``I'm always amazed, so I don't even try to guess,'' he said.
   The Social Security Administration allows the Postal Service
three mailing days before acting to replace missing checks in such
cases, said Phyllis France, district manager of the Evansville
Social Security office. The three-day limit ends Wednesday, and
reissued checks would take 10 days to deliver.
   Isadore Goldblatt, 74, said there had been no interruption in
the delivery of his bills.
   ``I'm hurting,'' he said. ``That's really the only income I
have.''

<TEXT>
   Three convicted killers who escaped
from the West Virginia Pententiary are ``probably several states
away by now,'' a state prison official said today.
   ``There's been no news on them, whatsover,'' said Corrections
Commissioner A.V. Dodrill. ``We're not searching any areas around
the prison.
   ``Information has been given to other police agencies in the
area, and they are checking that out. What it boils down to is
routine police work.''
   Authorities in Ohio and Pennsylvania also reported no trace of
the three, who broke through an elevator shaft and used bolt
cutters to escape Sunday night.
   Police immediately gave protection to those who helped convict
one of the three, Bobby Stacy, including a Columbus, Ohio, woman
who testified against him. The woman, a former friend of Stacy's,
received death threats and her car was burned during his trial.
   Stacy, 35, was convicted of killing a police officer and accused
of shooting another. Authorities say he had vowed to kill the
prosecutor and circuit judge who had put him behind bars.
   ``He is educated and cold-blooded. That's the worst combination
there is,'' said Charles Hatcher, an assistant Cabell County
prosecutor and one of those Stacy threatened to kill. ``My fear is
that some police officer is going to get killed, because that's
this guy's method.''
   Hatcher said he had no plans to ask for protection for himself,
but Cabell County Circuit Judge Alfred E. Ferguson asked that an
extra bailiff be assigned to him.
   Stacy, David Williams, 28, and Tommie Mollohan, 45, were
discovered missing from the maximum-security prison during a
routine check Sunday night, officials said.
   State police searched West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania for
the three, and roadblocks were set up on routes leading into Ohio
and Pennsylvania, which borders Marshall County, where the prison
is, to the east.
   Mollohan was convicted of robbing and then killing a Brounland
grocer in 1973 after he escaped from a Florida prison. He also was
wanted in Georgia and North Carolina on armed robbery charges.
   Williams, serving a life sentence for felony murder, arson and
robbery, was convicted in the December 1980 slaying of a Marytown
resident, who was found bludgeoned in the rubble of his burned home.
   Warden Jerry Hedrick told reporters Monday that evidence
indicated the escapees had outside help. He said bloodhounds
tracked their scent across the street to a museum parking lot,
where the trail disappeared.
   Hedrick said the three, all maintenance workers, knocked a hole
in the wall of an elevator shaft in the prison infirmary to gain
entrance to a shed where equipment, including bolt cutters, is kept.
   Then they climbed through another elevator shaft to the second
floor of an unused building, where they used pipe and a cord to
lower themselves to the ground, he said.
   The escapees hid behind ventilation equipment, then used the
bolt cutters to cut through a lock on a gate and flee, he said.
   ``Something wasn't right with security,'' Hedrick said.
``Something was overlooked.''
   Stacy, formerly of Columbus, Ohio, was serving a life sentence
without chance of parole for the 1981 slaying of Huntington police
officer Paul Harmon, who was shot several times in the head with
his own service revolver. Harmon had been investigating another
officer's report of a suspicious person.
   At the time of the killing, Stacy was free on bond after being
charged with shooting a Huber Heights, Ohio, police officer with a
sawed-off shotgun.
   Stacy was a successful businessman who used the money from his
crimes for business ventures. When he was arrested, he owned a bar,
at least two houses and several automobiles.
   Huntington police officers, who usually patrol traffic alone,
teamed up in pairs Monday. ``It's always better to have two people.
A suspect is less likely to shoot that way,'' said Lt. Toby Shy.

   More potential jurors were questioned today
in the cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr., with attorneys asking
panelists about the defendant's mother, former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Questioning resumed after a judge lifted a gag order Monday that
restricted media coverage of jury selection. News organizations
protested, and it was rescinded when all sides agreed to permit a
pool of six reporters.
   All three panelists questioned this morning said they had read
newspaper accounts of the case since Zaccaro was charged in 1986
with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police
agent. Zaccaro was a senior at Middlebury College.
   One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while the former congresswoman was
the Democratic nominee in 1984, and she thought the attacks had
carried over to the son after his arrest.
   However, the unidentified woman said her views would not
interfere with her judgment if she is chosen to hear the case.
   ``The press is not trying this case,'' she said. ``The issue is,
did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   Zaccaro faces a maximum prison term of five years if convicted.
   The long-delayed trial began Monday. Questioning of potential
panelists centered on their political beliefs and their views on
the impact of drugs on society.
   Zaccaro, 24, was accompanied in court by his parents, Ferraro
and John Zaccaro Sr.
   Judge Francis McCaffery imposed the gag order at the request of
defense attorneys, who were concerned that too many reporters in
the room could intimidate potential jurors. But he lifted it after
a challenge from media representatives and an agreement among
lawyers to allow six reporters to observe the proceedings.
   Robert Hemley, a lawyer representing media organizations,
including The Associated Press, told the judge there would be
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was
public.
   Lawyers on Monday completed initial questioning of at least
seven potential jurors of a pool of more than 20. More than 150
people could be interviewed.
   Several in the jury pool expressed strong feelings about the
role of drugs in society. One man who was dismissed said, ``I'd
probably be the one going to jail if I catch someone selling drugs
to my kid.''
   None of those questioned said Ferraro's place on the 1984
Democratic Party ticket would affect their judgment of her son.
   The trial comes more than two years after Zaccaro was arrested
outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   The charge involves allegations that Zaccaro sold cocaine to
undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to his off-campus
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his mother.
   But the Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the case.

<HEAD>Girl Loses $300,000 Jury Award Against Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has set aside a $300,000 jury award
to an 11-year-old girl who sued her father for hitting her in the
face, saying the amount was excessive.
   ``I was shocked at the verdict,'' Circuit Judge William G.
Plummer said Monday. ``That's the simplest way I can put it.''
   He ordered a new trial to decide what compensation Samantha
Baskin should receive from her father, Peter Baskin, a prominent
lawyer. But he cautioned that the girl's emotional health must be
considered before another trial can begin.
   The lawsuit stemmed from an incident Jan. 19, 1985, during which
Samantha was hit in the face after she interrupted an argument
between her parents.
   According to testimony at the three-day trial in January, Baskin
and his wife, Heidi, were arguing at the family's Falls Church home
when Samantha, then 8 years old, repeatedly told her father to stop
shouting because she was trying to sleep.
   Baskin, 45, told the jury that he followed his daughter upstairs
to her bedroom and, while he was trying to spank her on the
buttocks, she flipped over, cursed him with a word she had been
reprimanded for using before, and he slapped her on the face.
   ``This is a slap-in-the-face case, maybe too hard,'' but
nonetheless parental chastisement for repeated use of profanity,
said Leonard S. Sattler, one of Baskin's attorneys.
   Sattler argued Monday that the award, which included interest
dating to the incident, was out of proportion to the injury, which
he described as a temporary bruise.
   Samantha's attorney, David L. Duff, agreed there was limited
physical injury to his client. He argued, however, that she
suffered extensive emotional injury. Duff maintained that
Samantha's ``bond with her father was absolutely destroyed that
night.''
   In a separate court proceeding, Baskin was acquitted of a
criminal charge arising out of the incident.

   An American who says he was duped into
carrying cocaine into Spain was convicted of drug trafficking today
and sentenced to six years and a day in prison, a spokesman for the
U.S. Consulate in Barcelona said.
   Conan Owen, 23, of Annandale, Va., was found guilty by the
three-judge tribunal that heard his case in a one-day trial March
26, more than a year after his arrest.
   In addition to the prison term, Owen was fined $18,000,
consulate spokesman Peter Cecere said.
   Cecere said the three-judge panel headed by Judge Jose Presencia
Rubio acquitted Owen on charges of possessing contraband.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland said
Attorney General Edwin Meese III ``regrets very much this action by
the Spanish court.''
   ``I think it's important to stress that we continue to believe
today, as we have before, in Mr. Owen's innocence and we continue
to hope that he will ultimately be exonerated,'' Eastland said.
   Owen was arrested March 13, 1987 at Barcelona's El Prat Airport
after customs agents found 4.13 pounds of cocaine in a
false-bottomed suitcase he had checked through on a KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines flight from Santiago, Chile via Amsterdam.
   He has been detained at Barcelona's Modelo Prison since his
arrest.
   At Owen's trial, Presencia Rubio refused to admit as evidence
results of a polygraph test administered at the request of the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration _ evidence the defense said would
prove Owen's innocence.
   Owen will be eligible for parole after serving half the
sentence. The year he has served in prison will be subtracted from
his term.
   ``We don't know what we're going to do, whether we'll appeal,''
said Owen's father, Ernest, in a telephone interview. ``It's a
Catch 22. How long does an appeal take here? Maybe a prison
transfer would be shorter. Anyway, you know he's innocent.''
   Ernest Owen and his wife, Raquel, arrived in Barcelona on March
24.
   Conan Owen testified he had been contacted in the United States
by Jorge Barahona about a four-day job taking photographs in Chile
and Spain for the Sonsora tourist agency of Mexico City.
   On Feb. 5, Barahona, an Ecuadorian-born naturalized American,
received a two-year suspended sentence in an Alexandria, Va.,
federal court on a drug conspiracy charge after reaching a plea
bargain agreement with Assistant U.S. District Attorney Justin
Williams.
   Williams testified for the defense at Owen's trial that Barahona
told him ``Conan Owen had no knowledge that there was cocaine in
the suitcase he carried into Barcelona airport March 13.''
   Owen said Barahona had given him a suitcase to take to Santiago
which he was told contained tourist brochures.
   He said he carried the same or a similar suitcase from Santiago
to Barcelona.
   Spanish Civil Guard Angel Alonso Garcia, one of two witnesses
called by the prosecution, testified he found eight bags of cocaine
in a false bottom of Owen's suitcase.
   Owen testified he probably had been naive or stupid but added
``that is not a crime.''

   Soul singer James Brown surrendered today to
face charges that he beat his wife and fired a gun into a car while
she was inside.
   Brown, 54, was charged Monday with assault with intent to
murder, aggravated assault and battery. The two-time Grammy winner
turned himself in this morning and was released on $15,000 bond,
said Aiken County Sheriff Carrol Heath.
   Brown has denied the charges.
   His wife, 38-year-old Adrienne Brown, told authorities that he
fired several shots at the couple's luxury car late Sunday while
she was inside and that he later beat her with an iron pipe.
   The incidents allegedly occurred at Brown's residence in Beech
Island, S.C., just across the Savannah River from Augusta, Ga.,
Heath said.
   Mrs. Brown, the singer's third wife, was treated for bruises at
University Hospital in Augusta on Monday evening and released, the
hospital said.
   Brown, a two-time Grammy Award winner known as the ``godfather
of soul,'' said the argument began because he was leaving for a
South American tour Thursday and his wife was upset because she
would not be going.
   ``I never laid a hand on her,'' Brown said. ``I can tell you
it's over now. She's not coming back to my house. She's just mad
because I won't take her to Brazil, and she's not going to go.
She's never going to go.''
   Mrs. Brown told officers she was sleeping in the car after the
argument Sunday night when three shots were fired into the trunk of
the car and a fourth hit under the right front headlight. She said
she was beaten when she sneaked back into the house early Monday.
   Brown's attorney, Albert Dallas, said: ``Mr. and Mrs. Brown have
had an ongoing domestic issue for three years. Mr. Brown has filed
for divorce half a dozen times. They have always reconciled their
differences.''
   Brown, who created such soulful hits as ``Please, Please,
Please'' and ``It's a Man's World,'' won his second Grammy in 1987
for the rhythm and blues vocal ``Living in America.''

<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MASHA HAMILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When movie stars Mariel Hemingway and
Ben Cross were filming in the occupied West Bank, they checked to
make sure sounds of explosions were coming from the set, not from
battling Arabs and Israelis.
   Israeli-born producer Yoram Ben-Ami bought war insurance for
$10,000 from the Israeli government and hired extra guards to
protect the actors and crew.
   The insurance means that the movie-makers are covered for up to
$2 million if production on their television movie is affected by
Arab-Israeli strife.
   The 4-month-old Palestinian uprising interfered in another way:
several Arab villages chosen for filming had to be crossed off the
schedule because ``we just couldn't take the risk,'' said
production designer Keith Wilson.
   But actors and crew in ``Steal the Sky'' said during their five
weeks of filming in Israel they were largely untouched by the
nearly daily violence that has left more than 135 Palestinians and
one Israeli soldier dead.
   ``We have been incredibly lucky,'' Cross said in an interview on
a Tel Aviv set. ``We have filmed in Arab quarters and Jewish
quarters and have been in no danger.''
   At a time when the unrest has caused tourism to decline, tennis
star Chris Evert to cancel plans to appear in a tournament in
Israel nd Roman Catholic church officials to call off a Palm Sunday
procession, the presence of actors and a film crew in the West Bank
is cause for some surprise.
   The Home Box Office Inc. film is the first movie to be made in
Israel since the uprising began Dec. 8, said Ben-Ami.
   ``In a way, I wanted to make a statement by doing this film here
now,'' said Ben-Ami, an American citizen who lives in Los Angeles.
   ``Steal the Sky'' is based on a true story and deals with an
aspect of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Hemingway plays an Israeli Mossad secret agent who persuades an
Iraqi pilot, portrayed by Cross, to defect and fly to Israel in
August 1966 aboard one of the coveted, Soviet-built MiG-21
airplanes the West wants to examine.
   The plane, studied by the United States and Israel, is today in
the Israeli Air Force Museum. The agent and the defector vanished,
their identities protected.
   Scenes that were to take place in Iraq were filmed in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank's biblical town of Jericho and nearby
Anatot.
   The West Bank shooting took about two weeks. In the disputed
hills, crew members could be heard shouting in English and Hebrew:
``Quiet on the set please. Sheket, bevakasha.''
   In one scene, a military jeep was blown up.
   ``When we were filming and heard shots or special effects, I
often wondered if it was real or not,'' said Hemingway.
   In Israel, where politics is interwoven with daily life, Cross
said it was impossible to avoid conversations about the current
debate over what should be done to end the Palestinian rioting.
   ``Everyone wants to talk about the Arab-Israel conflict,'' he
said. ``But because it's an emotional subject, it is very dangerous
for me to get caught up in it.''
   Ben-Ami said he got the idea to make the film about three years
ago, and got approval from HBO for the $5.5 million movie last
year. Three days of filming in Rome and additional days in Reno,
Nev., are also scheduled.
   Ben-Ami said he understood other producers had canceled plans to
film in Israel, although he had no specific details.
   ``I am extremely sad that people are so much afraid of suffering
that they are missing wonderful locations here,'' he said.
   The production of ``Steal the Sky'' was a model for coexistence,
said Ben-Ami. ``We had Arabs working as extras,'' he said, ``and
both Arabs and Israelis on the crew and our guards are Druse,''
members of a mystical sect which is an offshoot of Islam.
   Ben-Ami said the dialogue in his movie ``is up-to-date. It's a
film that shows things that were an issue in Israel and the Middle
East 25 years ago are still an issue today.''
   ``The Israelis have to be strong. You cannot make peace with a
scared people,'' he said. ``We are in a marathon race with the
Arabs. Whoever is strong will win.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of 1,300 additional
American troops flew to Panama today in what Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's military regime called an ``invasion.''
   With the first cargo plane scheduled to arrive late this
afternoon, the Panamanian Health Ministry issued a communique
calling the additional soldiers potential AIDS carriers.
   Meanwhile, neighbors and aides said state security agents
surrounded the home of Ricardo Arias Calderon, the head of the
Christian Democratic Party and a leading government opponent.
   Luis Camacho, an aide who was in Arias Calderon's home, said in
a telephone interview the house was surrounded Monday night by four
carloads of plainclothes police who continued their vigil early
today.
   Camacho said Arias Calderon was not at home, but declined to
disclose his whereabouts. The aide said the party leader's wife and
other family members were in the house ``and are virtually
incommunicado except for the phone.''
   The Health Ministry statement said the ``growing number of
American soldiers'' not only ``constitute an armed threat to our
sovereignty and independence,'' but ``a real danger to the health
of our people.''
   The ministry maintained that tests showed U.S. military
personnel show a high rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
a fatal disease that can be transmitted by sexual contact.
   ``Knowing their clinical history, we can do no less than exhort
our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with
these soldiers,'' the statement said.
   The United States has begun screening military personnel for
exposure to the virus that causes AIDS. The Pentagon reported in
February that about 3,000 of some 2 million active duty personnel
tested positive for the virus.
   The Pentagon said last week it was sending the additional
soldiers to bolster 10,500 U.S. troops and installations used to
protect the Panama Canal.
   The decision followed five weeks of unrest and an opposition
attempt to oust Noriega. As head of the 15,000-member Panamanian
Defense Forces, Noriega is the power behind the civilian
government. He is under indictment in the United States on federal
drug trafficking charges.
   La Republica, a military-run newspaper, told its readers Sunday,
``Panamanians must prepare themselves to reject the invasion.''
   The United States contends the troop buildup is within the
bounds of the 1977 treaties that gave the Panama Canal Zone back to
Panama in 1979 and will give Panama the canal at the end of 1999.
   The United States, which supports the opposition move to oust
Noriega, has cut off Panama's flow of dollars, virtually paralyzing
the bankrupt government and leading to closure of the nation's
banks.
   The U.S. government said on Monday it does not plan military or
further economic actions against Panama.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington that
even though it might take more time than anticipated, Noriega will
eventually step down.
   Opposition leaders insisted on Monday that the strike officially
remained in effect, but their call appeared to be generally
unheeded by retailers.
   Many factories, which are more directly under the control of the
strike organizers, remained closed.
   Monsignor Marcos Antonio McGrath, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of Panama City, had offered to mediate Panama's dispute between
Noriega and opposition groups. But government-controlled television
stations on Monday quoted unidentified government officials as
saying the government never received a formal, written invitation
from the church.
   Monsignor Oscar Brown, the auxiliary bishop of Panama City, said
in an interview on the Channel 2 television station, ``We didn't
make the invitation in a formal, written fashion to each of the
parties involved.''
   ``The invitation was made through our public press conference,''
he said. ``We made this public, open invitation to all the parties
involved.''
   The government held its own ``national dialogue'' Monday at a
downtown convention center, without the presence of either the
Catholic Church or the National Civic Crusade, the main opposition
alliance.

<HEAD>Judge: Teaching Assistant Can't Be Fired For African Head Wrap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fired teaching assistant's abilities
weren't marred by the native African head wrap she wore in class,
and she can't be denied unemployment benefits for that reason, a
judge has ruled.
   The Mississippi Employment Security Commission improperly
witheld compensation from Deborah V. McGlothin, Hinds Circuit Court
Judge Frank Banks ruled recently.
   The 34-year-old McGlothin was dismissed as a teaching assistant
at Whitfield Elementary School on March 17, 1987. Principal Kisiah
W. Nolan recommended the firing because McGlothin refused to stop
wearing head wraps, court records show.
   McGlothin went to court because she was refused unemployment
compensation. A commission referee said her firing was based on
misconduct, and that disqualified her from benefits.
   ``There was absolutely no showing that McGlothin's dress in any
way affected her performance or caused a disruption,'' Banks said
in the ruling last week. ``Such practices are protected by the
First Amendment to the United States Constitution and cannot be
`misconduct' within the meaning of the (unemployment compensation)
statute, so as to deny unemployment benefits.''
   ``I hope the case will set a precedent for serious-minded people
of our culture and religion,'' McGlothin said. ``I'd like to
commend Judge Banks.''
   McGlothin, who hopes to become a certified teacher, testified
the head wrap is a form of cultural and religious expression.
McGlothin said she follows the beliefs of the African Hebrew
Israelites of Ethiopia.
   Her religion doesn't force her to wear the head dress, but
members of her faith ``wear it on occasion, especially during times
of spiritual growth,'' she said at an unemployment commission
hearing.
   Nolan had sent her a memo telling her to stop wearing the head
wrap or be fired, court records show.
   ``All children need positive role models, but especially do
elementary-aged children because of their very impressionable young
minds. I am concerned that your appearance is giving them a
distorted view of what is appropriate,'' Nolan said in the memo.

   Club-carrying warriors in grass skirts
presented this Pacific archipelago's president with roasted pigs
and mats Tuesday, installing him as a tribal chief.
   The traditional ceremony gave President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau
tribal authority over 40,000 indigenous Fijians in four provinces
of the island chain about 2,000 miles east of Australia.
   Ganilau, 69, was appointed president of the Republic of Fiji in
December after coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka broke from British rule
and set up a military-backed republican government. Rabuka said he
intended to restore political control to ethnic Fijians, who make
up 45 percent of the population of 715,000.
   They are outnumbered by Indians, who represent half of Fiji's
people.
   Guards with clubs stood by as thousands of tribesmen watched
Tuesday's elaborate ceremony on Taveuni island 150 miles north of
the capital of Suva.
   During the ceremony, Ganilau was presented with trays of whole
roasted pigs, mats and foodstuffs by vassal tribes, guests and
other chiefs. Fiji maintains a complex tribal hierarchy.
   After he was installed, Ganilau observed custom by beginning a
four-day retreat.

   The University of California-San Diego Medical
Center put its unsuccessful liver transplant program on indefinite
hold while outside experts try to figure out why all four of the
program's patients died.
   Pat JaCoby, a spokeswoman for the medical center, said Monday
that two liver transplant experts have been asked to review the
hospital's program.
   One of the outside experts reportedly is from the UCLA Medical
Center, which has a successful liver transplant program. Dr. Ronald
W. Busuttil said he would visit the UC San Diego Medical Center
next month as part of the review.
   ``I presume they're going to ask me to review those four
cases,'' he said.
   He declined to discuss the specifics of the cases, but added,
``Obviously, a zero percent survival rate is not good.''
   Dr. Oscar L. Bronsther resigned as head of UC San Diego's liver
transplant program shortly after the fourth patient died.

   Rustlers armed with machine guns killed

   Officials blamed the weekend raids in eastern Uganda on the

   Eight people were shot and killed in one raid on a village,
according to the government newspaper New Vision.
   In another attack, rustlers killed three people and stole cattle
and household goods, New Vision reported.
   In a third raid lasting four hours, rustlers stormed three
villages near Mbale 170 miles east of the capital of Kampala. They
stole 1,000 cattle and shot to death two people, including a
soldier, said regional government spokesman James Aleko.

   A man who was in court facing charges of
stealing a 1988 Lincoln Town Car was caught driving a stolen 1981
Mercedes while his trial was in recess for lunch, police said.
   Charles Turk's difficulties, bad enough Monday morning, were

   Turk, 26, in court to face the first charge, was told to come

   He came back 90 minutes late via the county jail.
   In the interim, Turk was spotted driving a 1981 Mercedes
reported stolen March 30, according to an arrest report. After he
lost control of the car and smashed into a tree, police said they
saw him rush into a woman's apartment. The woman told officers she
didn't know Turk.
   Turk was charged with burglary, resisting arrest, opposing a
police officer, fleeing and eluding police and reckless driving.
Bail on the charges totaled $11,500.
   His public defender, Terry Rogers, was granted a postponement.
Rogers told Griffin his client wanted some time to think about his
legal predicament.

<TEXT>
   San Diego police are re-evaluating procedures
that allow vice officers to disrobe and engage in sexual foreplay
during prostitution investigations, a high-ranking police official
said.
   The probe was prompted by local news accounts of the San Diego
Police Department's use of such tactics in contrast to metropolitan
police departments elsewhere in the state, said Deputy Chief Norman
Stamper.
   ``We are very carefully evaluating our enforcement posture,''
said Stamper, who recently was assigned to head the force's
26-member vice unit.
   According to court records, San Diego vice officers stripped
naked and allowed themselves to be fondled last year while
soliciting for sex during investigations into massage parlors and
escort services.
   The tactics are allowed under state law, but police departments
in Los Angeles and San Francisco and other cities have outlawed
such activities because they were considered embarrassing to the
force or entrapment.
   The San Diego review could take between a few weeks and several
months, Stamper said.
   ``Any time you're dealing with prostitutes, gambling or
drunkenness, one thing is clear _ vice enforcement is different
than other types of enforcement,'' Stamper said. ``If you want to
judge it _ it's a dirty, messy job.''
   ``We pride ourselves on being a professional organization whose
officers act in a professional manner,'' Stamper said.

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law firm billed the state Department
of Transportation $1,593 an hour for the equivalent of 25 days work
its attorneys spent fighting a land condemnation case.
   The department was billed $325,000 for 204 hours by the law firm
of Greene, Greene, Falck and Coalson, and two courts approved the
fee.
   The law firm, which is now disbanded, also collected $1,372 an
hour _ $280,000 _ from landowner David M. Foster under a
contingency fee agreement.
   The combined bonanza for the law firm came to $2,965 an hour.
   ``The trial judge and the appellate court must have thought it
was a difficult case'' when they awarded the fee, said William L.
Coalson, who was a partner in the firm.
   The $1,593 hourly rate approved by the court was four times
greater than the previous record of $340 per hour awarded in a
condemnation case in 1978, according to a memo from the agency's
lawyers.
   The Department of Transportation is considering taking its case
to the Florida Supreme Court, in part to discourage other lawyers
from asking for similar fees in cases where the agency takes land
to build or improve a highway, transportation officials said.
   The case started when the state offered Foster $582,000 for nine
acres to improve an intersection in Jacksonville, said Ken
Towcimak, the agency's right-of-way chief.
   Foster argued that the land was far more valuable because it was
behind a shopping center and therefore ripe for retail development.
   At a December 1986 trial, the 12-member Duval County jury said
the parcel was worth $1.9 million, $1.3 million more than the
original offer by the road department.
   To fulfill its legal obligation to pay attorney and appraisal
fees for landowners, the road department was ordered by the court
to pay $325,000, although Coalson's firm disclosed the contingency
arrangement by which it had already earned $280,000.
   ``What our client pays us with his eyes wide open is none of
their (the state's) business,'' Coalson said.

   An 84-year-old man was bitten on both hands
and an arm as he wrestled a pit bull to the ground and tried to pry
open its jaws when the dog attacked his little toy terrier,
officials said.
   Andrew Zarlinski had eight stitches to close a gash on his right
thumb, authorities said Monday.
   Despite his gallant efforts, his five-pound pet, Sir Chat, died
in the Sunday attack.
   Zarlinski said he was walking Sir Chat when the pit bull jumped
from behind some shrubbery and attacked.
   ``He just dove on him,'' Zarlinski said. ``I grabbed him and
tried to pull him out.''
   The pit bull has been impounded, but because the dog has no
record of bites he probably will be released after a 10 days
confinement for rabies observation, officials said.

   An expert parachutist apparently fell to
his death when he jumped from a plane without realizing that he
wasn't wearing a parachute, officials say.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the death
Saturday of Ivan Lester McGuire to learn if pilot Mark Luman had
checked to see if McGuire was wearing a parachute, Walter L.
Rigsbee, airworthiness inspector for the FAA's district office in
Raleigh, said Monday.
   McGuire, 35, of Durham, was carrying video equipment to film a
student and an instructor from the Franklin County Sports Parachute
Center when he jumped to his death from an altitude of 10,500 feet.
   Investigators have ruled out suicide and say McGuire, who had
made more than 800 jumps, may have made his fatal mistake because
he was tired or preoccupied with filming.
   ``We haven't gotten all the facts yet. But there is a
regulation, No. 105, that states that the pilot must check _ well,
no one may jump unless the pilot checks the parachutes,'' Rigsbee
said.
   The video equipment McGuire was carrying may have been mistaken
for a parachute, the FAA official said.

   Police today arrested Juan Ramon
Matta, a Honduran wanted by the United States in the slaying of a
special narcotics agent, his lawyer said.
   Lawyer Carlos Lorenzana said in a telephone interview that about
60 policemen, supported by army helicopters, raided Matta's
luxurious home in Tegucigalpa before dawn and captured him and
seven bodyguards.
   Lorenzana said the raid began at 5:45 a.m., but gave no other
details. He said Matta was taken to a special police unit
headquarters at the village of La Venta, 12 miles east of the
capital, where he was being questioned.
   A police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused
to provide reporters details of the raid or confirm it had
occurred. But armed police surrounded Matta's and Lorenzana's homes
in the capital.
   Matta, 43, returned to Honduras after escaping in 1986 from a
Colombian prison where he was being held on charges that he was a
top operative for the Medellin drug cartel.
   He was jailed here briefly and on his release threw 100 lempira
bills out the window of his Mercedes to convicts in the yard. The
bills are the equivalent of $50.
   ``In jail, there are always needy people,'' he told The
Associated Press in an interview in February.
   He said of the charges against him, ``It's all a lie, a story.''
He also claimed U.S. agents tried three times to kidnap him in the
past year.
   Matta is wanted in the United States on drug charges and in
connection with the 1985 torture-murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena Salazar in Guadalajara,
Mexico.
   He is a Honduran citizen, and the constitution prohibits his
extradition.

   Contra leaders today demanded freedom for their
negotiators to move around Nicaragua during next week's peace
talks, rejecting a Sandinista proposal limiting them to a Managua
airport hotel.
   ``We will not go to Nicaragua to be confined,'' Contra director
Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said at a news conference at the Miami
headquarters of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the anti-government
rebels are formally called.
   Adolfo Calero, the director named today as head of the
negotiating team, said the Contras were demanding the right to meet
freely with Nicaraguan opposition leaders, the press, Roman
Catholic and anti-draft groups, and to publish their ads in both
the government and opposition press.
   Chamorro said the Contras sent their counterproposal to the
leftist Sandinista government late this morning and were awaiting a
reply.
   The rebel leaders said they intend to arrive April 12 in Managua
with 60 people, including the five directors, members of the
Resistance assembly, and political figures.
   Their schedule calls six meetings with the Sandinistas before
the delegation leaves April 15.
   ``The agenda is open,'' said Calero, saying the Contras will
emphasize democratization.
   The Contras dismissed several reported violations of the truce
signed last month in Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   ``Overall the cease-fire is holding,'' said Chamorro.
   But he added that the truce cannot become definitive until the
Sandinistas agree and take steps toward democratizing Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Mohammed Hamadi Trial Expected In Late May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of TWA hijacking
suspect Mohammed Hamadi is expected to start in Frankfurt at the
end of May, a Frankfurt court official said Tuesday.
   Mohammed Hamadi was charged in February with murder, hijacking,
hostage-taking and other crimes stemming from the June 1985
hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut. U.S. Navy diver Robert
Stethem was killed during the hijacking and 39 Americans were held
hostage for 17 days.
   Frankfurt state court spokesman Falk Thomas said the exact date
of the trial's opening remained to be set but that it was expected
at the end of next month. He said the court will hold hearings
three times a week.
   Thomas spoke to reporters at the Duesseldorf trial of Abbas
Hamadi, Mohammed Hamadi's older brother, who is accused of
masterminding the kidnapping of two West Germans in a bid to force
the West German government to release Mohammed.
   Mohammed Hamadi, a 23-year-old Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was
arrested at Frankfurt airport Jan. 13, 1987, when a customs agent
discovered liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The United States requested Mohammed Hamadi's extradition
shortly after his arrest to answer charges of murder and air piracy.
   The West German government, reportedly fearing for the lives of
the two West German hostages, rejected the extradition demand last
June and instead pledged to try Hamadi in this country.
   Abbas Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport two weeks after
his brother's arrest.
   At the trial of Abbas Hamadi on Tuesday, prosecutor Hartmut
Reibold asked that the accused be sentenced to two years and three
months on the explosives charges he is being tried on.
   In his closing arguments, Reibold alleged that Abbas and his
brother had smuggled a potent liquid explosive, methylnitrate, from
Beirut to West Germany at the beginning of 1987. The explosive was
found buried in a field not far from the French border after Abbas
Hamadi's arrest.
   Abbas Hamadi, 29, is also charged with masterminding the
kidnapping of West German businessmen Rudolf Cordes and Alfred
Schmidt to try to force the West German government to release
Mohammed Hamadi. Schmidt was released by his captors in September
in a ``gesture of good will,'' while Cordes remains in captivity.
   The verdict in Abbas Hamadi's trial is expected on April 19.

   Nine people, including six princes
related to King Mswati III, have been detained without charge,
police said Tuesday.
   A South African news agency linked the detentions to last
month's convictions of 10 prominent Swazis for treason and other
political crimes.
   The latest detainees were held under an act allowing detentions
of up to 60 days without charge, said deputy police commissioner
Mnguni Simelaba. He gave no reason for the detentions.
   The South African Press Association quoted unidentified sources
as saying the detentions resulted from evidence at last month's
closed trial of the 10 Swazis, including Prince Bhekimpi, the
former prime minister.
   He was among seven defendants given 15-year prison terms for
plotting against the queen of this southern African monarchy
between 1982 and 1986.

<TEXT>
   Police using hand shovels and a backhoe
continued digging today in the back yard of a home where three
skulls and gruesome photographs of torture were found.
   The investigation began after a 22-year-old man told police he
had escaped from the house after being held for five days in a
basement, tortured and sexually assaulted. The owner of the house,
Robert Berdella, was arrested Saturday.
   Police are reviewing disappearances of young men in 1984 and
1985 as well as other unsolved cases to see if there is a
connection, Sgt. Troy Cole of the Kansas City Police Department's
homicide unit said Monday.
   Berdella, 39, was charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy,
one count of felonious restraint and one count of first-degree
assault. He pleaded innocent to the charges but remained in custody
in lieu of $500,000 bond.
   A skull believed to be that of a human was found Sunday buried
in the yard. Two other skulls, one also believed human were found
by police in Berdella's three-story house, along with what appeared
to be human neck bones, police spokesman Alan French said today.
   The excavation of Berdella's back yard was expected to be
completed later today, he said, and police then planned a more
thorough examination of the house.
   Investigators already drilled through some sections of what
appeared to be a freshly poured concrete floor in the basement, but
found nothing suspicious.
   Sgt. Laura Mulloy, a police spokeswoman, said pictures seized in
the house showed a captive hitchhiker being tortured and a young
man who may have been dead.
   ``The neighborhood is in shock over this,'' said Astrid Bebuhr,
who lives across the street from Berdella. ``There was no
indication that somebody was being tortured in his home.''
   Police found a white metal box filled with feathers buried in
the yard. Ms. Mulloy said officers did not know the significance of
the discovery.
   French said an FBI agent who is a specialist in cults would be
joining the investigation today.
   While Berdella was waiting in a Jackson County courtroom to be
arraigned Monday, he was assaulted by a man whose son has been
missing for four years, said Jackson County Prosecutor Albert
Riederer.
   Berdella was not seriously injured.
   Paul Howell, 44, told a reporter after police let him go that
his son, Jerry Howell, was reported to have been seen with Berdella
before disappearing in July 1984. His son was 19 years old at the
time.
   Berdella owns Bob's Bazaar Bizarre, a shop in the Old Westport
Flea Market, where his wares include replicas of skulls, as well as
beads, jewelry and exotic ornaments. Howell, the father of the
missing boy, had a shop in the same flea market but closed it after
his son's disappearance.
   Berdella's neighbors said he was active in a crime prevention
program in his neighborhood. He lobbied for neighborhood watch
signs and urged neighbors to put up porch lights, they said.

<HEAD>National Assessment Finds Computer Competence Low Among Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer literacy is low among U.S. students
because few have adequate access to the machinery, according to a
first-ever nationwide survey released Tuesday which also found
minorities falling behind white students.
   A majority of the 24,000 third-, seventh- and 11th graders
tested by the National Assessment of Educational Progress knew what
a joystick and a keyboard were, but most had little or no working
knowledge of computer functions or programs.
   Despite the much-ballyhooed, decade-old ``classroom computer
revolution,'' most schools have yet to make effective use of
computers to teach reading, math or science, according to the
82-page NAEP report entitled, ``Computer Competence: The First
National Assessment.''
   Among 837 school computer coordinators surveyed, NAEP found 32
percent of third-grade coordinators, 23 percent of seventh-grade
coordinators, and 10 percent of 11th grade coordinators did not
feel adequately prepared to teach computer science.
   More than 90 percent of third graders and 86 percent of seventh
graders said they liked using computers, and more than half said
they wished they used them more.
   However, a majority said they lacked adequate access to
computers at school or at home. The report also found school
curricula haven't changed to make effective use of computers, and
most teachers aren't adequately trained.
   ``The difference is between knowing a little about the computer,
and being able to use it effectively. Few American school children
can do the latter,'' said Marc Tucker, president of the National
Center on Education and the Economy in Washington, who called the
NAEP results ``disappointing.''
   NAEP is a project established 19 years ago by the U.S. Congress
to conduct national surveys of various educational skills. It is
administered by the Educational Testing Service in Lawrence
Township, N.J.
   NAEP examined grade schoolers across the country during the
spring of 1986. It used multiple choice questions to test student
knowledge about computers and to gather information about their
feelings toward computers and how much exposure they have to them.
   Among the report's findings:
   _ White students scored 5 percent to 8 percent higher on average
than blacks and Hispanics, mainly due to greater access to
computers at home and in school. Boys also outperformed girls
slightly, private school students had an edge over public
schoolers, and Northeastern students knew more about computers than
those in other regions.
   _ Most third graders could identify the main parts of a
computer, such as the keyboard, floppy disk and joystick. By
seventh grade, nearly all could.
   But only three out of ten 11th graders knew what an algorithm is
(``a step by step process for solving a given type of problem.'')
   Only 32.3 percent of third graders, 34.3 percent of seventh
graders, and 46 percent of 11th graders could correctly answer:
``What is the main role of a computer program?'' (Answer: ``To tell
the computer what to do.'')
   _ Except for word processing, students generally scored poorly
on questions dealing with computer applications _ making graphics
or working with databases, for example _ because students said they
hardly ever got a chance to practice.
   _ More than eight of 10 seventh- and 11th-graders said they
never used computers to make a database, slightly over half said
they never used them to write letters, stories or reports, and
roughly three-quarters said they never used them to make graphs.
   _ Student knowledge of three common computer languages _ Logo,
BASIC and Pascal _ was also found to be poor largely because only
about 10 percent of students said they had written computer
programs more than once a week. About two-thirds of those surveyed
said they had never written computer programs.
   The grim assessment suggests that schools have only dented the
ignorance most students and teachers have of computers despite the
huge purchases of equipment by many schools during the 1980s. In
1980, 15 percent of elementary schools and 50 percent of high
schools offered computer instruction. By 1985, 82 percent of
elementary schools and 93 percent of secondary schools did so.
   ``Although some schools offer excellent computer curricula, many
other schools apparently do not provide effective instruction, at
least in computer applications and programming, to a large
proportion of pupils,'' the survey concluded.

   A man described as retarded has been sentenced to
60 years in prison for allowing his 23-day-old daughter to starve.
   The jury which earlier found Oscar Fred Grothe, 36, guilty of
murdering his daughter, Heidi, set the sentence Monday.
   Grothe's wife, Rebecca, also faces murder charges.
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Jim Buchanan said the
child deliberately was not fed and not given medical attention. The
couple's 2-year-old boy is healthy and shows the Grothes know how
to care for a child, Buchanan said.
   Grothe's attorney, Linda Cryer, was not allowed to present
testimony about her client's history, including his time in a state
school for the mentally retarded. She said Grothe had an I.Q. of 68.
   Ms. Cryer contended the death could have been due to the lack of
a thymus gland and an inability to retain salt. She planned to
appeal the verdict.

   The widow of a World War I veteran has
given her husband's Purple Heart medal to a 13-year-old boy who's
recovering from a 2{-month coma after a near-fatal, 40-foot fall.
   Shane Nicholich accepted the medal gingerly from Eleanor Prong,
79, a resident of the Washington Veterans Home here.
   ``I'd like to give you this medal, Shane, for the fighter you
are,'' Mrs. Prong said Saturday.
   In July 1986, Shane, then 12, fell out of a tree in his back
yard and suffered a severe head injury and brain damage. A 2{-month
coma followed, and doctors weren't encouraging about his recovery.
   But in February, Shane, of Sumner, won the school district
spelling bee by spelling ``hypodermic.''
   He's resumed a somewhat normal life, though he still undergoes
therapy.
   Mrs. Prong said she and her late husband, Gustave August Prong,
have no close relatives and she wanted Shane to have the medal.
   Prong, who died at age 61 in 1959, was awarded the Purple Heart
posthumously about 10 years ago, 62 years after his left kneecap
was shattered by German bullets in the Argonne Forest in France.

   Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson today
complained that the slow count of caucus results in Colorado was
``beyond explanation'' and suggested it may have been delayed to
give the appearance of a lead for rival Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson said Colorado state Democratic Party Chairman Buie
Seawell had appeared ``biased and politically unethical'' for
remaining in control of the party apparatus while endorsing Dukakis.
   ``The state chairman endorsed Mr. Dukakis,'' Jackson said. ``You
cannot very well be a fair referee and coaching another player.''
   Jackson said Colorado Democrats had changed 30 caucus sites as
late as Friday or Saturday without telling the Jackson campaign.
   Jackson said his campaign manager, Gerald Austin, had been
trying to reach Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk to protest the
Colorado situation.
   ``It comes very close to obstructing justice,'' Jackson said. He
said the changing of caucus sites ``goes to the heart of the
pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act.''
   As an example of unfairness, Jackson said one of the caucus
sites was in the governor's mansion.
   ``A caucus site in the governor's mansion does not appear to be
proper,'' he said. The caucus sites ``should be in very public
places, mutually agreed upon by the candidates and the party.''
   Jackson said he did not publicly protest the changing of caucus
sites while campaigning in Colorado over the weekend because he
wanted ``to avoid creating conflict.''
   He said Austin had protested to Seawell, whose response Jackson
described as ``not one that was rationale.''
   Jackson spoke to reporters after appearing before auto workers
in Kenosha, the last stop of his campaign in Wisconsin as voters
were going to the polls for the state presidential primary.
   ``This long and slow count represents a certain ineptness ... it
heightens suspicions,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson said the point was underscored by the fact that missing
precincts were in Denver and Boulder _ not remote areas. As of this
afternoon, only a quarter of the Denver vote had been counted.
   ``To report selectively certain precincts today could be a way
of feeding the media on a timetable that favors a candidate you
favor _ and of course the state chairman favors a candidate. ...
It's controlling the process,'' Jackson said.
   ``The fact is the count should have been in now .... It is
unthinkable in 1988 with all this technology that Denver and
Boulder would come in last,'' he said.
   The state Democratic Party early this morning called off
counting for the night with Dukakis in the lead. With 44 percent of
the precincts reporting, the Massachusetts governor had 46 percent
to Jackson's 40 percent.
   ``It's beyond explanation the returns are this slow and this
late,'' Jackson said.
   He said Seawell's endorsement ``undermines credibility and makes
the process look to be less than just.''
   But Jackson added that he wasn't trying to ``impugn anyone's
character.''
   Jackson was hoping in Wisconsin to demonstrate broad support
beyond minorities, who make up a small portion of the voting
population in the state, and repeat the success he scored with a
landslide victory in neighboring Michigan 10 days earlier.
   Jackson was runing behind Dukakis in the latest Wisconsin
polling, but the race was considered a close two-way contest, with
Democrats Albert Gore Jr. and Paul Simon also running.
   Jackson hoped, as in Colorado a day earlier, that the large,
enthusiastic and racially mixed crowds that greeted him were a
harbinger of the primary outcome.
   As he campaigned, however, Jackson was dogged at every stop by
questions about his appeal to Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega to leave and offering ``to do whatever I can to help
alleviate the suffering'' _ an appeal that he made two weeks ago
but that burst back into view with Noriega's response on the eve of
the voting.
   Faced with a suggestion from the State Department that he was
interfering, Jackson telephoned top State Department officials from
a campaign stop and told reporters he and the administration were
in agreement on the need for Noriega to leave and for humanitarian
aid to Panama's poor.
   ``Our positions in fact overlap,'' Jackson said. ``Our position,
that he should go, is the same.''
   Jackson said he was not warned to tone down his efforts, but the
suggestion of a foreign policy misstep was not what the Jackson
campaign wanted just at the time it was seeking a breakthrough in
substantial white support.

plane lands. The remaining 165 passengers escape from the plane,
and 30 are injured in the escape.
   _May 19, 1987: An airport worker seizes control of an Air New
Zealand Boeing 747 on the ground in Suva, Fiji. He releases 24 of
27 crewmembers and all 105 passengers, and demands that he be taken
to Libya and that the 6-day-old military regime free deposed Prime
Minister Timoci Bavadra. One of the three crewmen uses a liquor
bottle to knock him out, ending the incident.
   _March 12, 1987: Juan Gonzalez, 23, is killed by a police
officer after he tries to hijack a Cubana Airlines plane to the
United States as it takes off in Havana. One of three grenades he
carries explodes, injuring 13 passengers. Two accomplices,
including Gonzalez' mother, escape but are recaptured.
   _Dec. 25, 1986: Iraqi Airways Flight 163 from Baghdad, Iraq, to
Amman, Jordan, with 107 people aboard is hijacked by two gunmen and
crashes half-mile from the desert airstrip at Arar, Saudi Arabia.
Sixty-two people die in a gun battle between the hijackers and
Saudi authorities _ the highest death toll in a hijacking or
attempt. Callers claim responsibility for five different terrorist
factions.
   _Oct. 18, 1986, eight gunmen seize a Suriname Airways charter
aircraft after it lands at Raleigh Falls, Suriname, and ordered the
pilot to take off, leaving 14 tourists to make their own way by
riverboat and car to Paramaribo, the South American country's
capital, 170 miles away. The gunmen are thought to be allied with a
renegade army officer who has vowed to oust the government.
   _Sept. 5, 1986: Four Palestinians armed with machine guns seize
a Pan Am jumbo jet with about 400 people aboard at the airport in
Karachi, Pakistan. The 17-hour ordeal ends when the plane's fuel
runs out, its lights blink off and the hijackers open fire and toss
grenades at passengers. Twenty-one passengers are killed and more
than 100 people are wounded.
   _June 7, 1986: A man commandeers an Aeronica Boeing 727 as it
prepares to take off from Sandino International Airport in Managua,
Nicaragua, and demands to be taken to El Salvador. He is captured
three hours later.
   _May 3, 1986: A man hijacks a Horizon Air commuter jet with 11
other passengers and two crewmembers en route to Medford, Ore., and

EgyptAir plane on a flight from Athens to Cairo and force it to
Malta. It was raided by Egyptian commandos on Nov. 24, and 60
people died.
   _June 15, 1985: Shiite Moslem gunmen seize a TWA jetliner on an
Athens-to-Rome flight and force it to Beirut. One American, a U.S.
Navy diver, is killed. Thirty-nine Americans are held hostage for
17 days before being released.
   _June 13, 1985: A single hijacker, in retaliation for hijacking
of a Jordanian jet two days earlier, seizes control of a
Lebanese-owned Middle East Airlines flight. It lands in Larnaca,
Cyprus, and the hijacker surrenders.
   _June 11, 1985: Six Shiite gunmen hijack a Jordanian airliner
about to depart Beirut for Amman, Jordan, and force it to fly to
Cyprus, then to Tunis, Tunisia, where authorities refuse to let it
land. They eventually return to Beirut, where the passengers are
permitted to disembark 29 hours after the hijacking began. The
terrorists then blow up the plane.
   _Dec. 3, 1984: Gunmen seize a Kuwait Airways plane on a flight
from Dubai to Karachi, Pakistan, and force it to Tehran. The
five-day ordeal ends when Iranian security men enter the plane in
disguise and surprise the hijackers. Two of the four Americans on

   A convicted marijuana smuggler told Congress
today of an offer eight years ago by then-Panamian ruler Omar
Torrijos and an aide _ Manuel Antonio Noriega _ to use an island
off Panama for drug shipments.
   But the smuggler, Michael P. Vogel, said he and an associate
rejected the offer because the two Panamanian leaders ``were being
extremely, extremely greedy.''
   Vogel said he traveled to Panama in late 1979 or early 1980 with
a Cuban associate who was interested in establishing a shipment
base for drugs. They met with Torrijos and Noriega, who now is
Panama's military ruler and under U.S. indictment on drug charges,
for about three hours, he testified.
   ``They wanted `x' amount of dollars for each pound of
marijuana,'' or about $100,000 per trip, Vogel said, an amount out
of proportion for the small shipments he had planned.
   Vogel also described for the Senate Foreign Relations narcotics
subcommittee the elaborate methods he and other smugglers developed
over his 14-year career to evade U.S. drug interdiction efforts.
   The methods included intelligence collection, sometimes using
officials inside federal agencies, and electronic countermeasures
to detect law enforcment vessels. Smugglers would obtain the radio
frequencies officials used for communications, and even had the
frequency of Air Force One, the president's plane, at one point, he
testified.
   Vogel now is serving a 12{-year sentence for his activities, and
testified under oath on the second day of a week-long continuation
of the panel's probe of the drug trade.
   On Monday a former, U.S. ambassador told the panel that Reagan
administration officials helped a Honduran general involved in a
drug-financed plot to assassinate that country's president get a
lighter sentence.
   Francis McNeil, former U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica, told a
Senate subcommittee Monday that top U.S. officials interceded on
behalf of Honduran Gen. Jose Bueso Rosa because he had helped the
administration's program of aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Among those who interceded on Bueso Rosa's behalf was Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, the administration's top
official in charge of inter-American affairs and a prime architect
of the Contra policy, McNeil said.
   McNeil said Bueso Rosa was charged in the United States with
taking part in a plot, financed by drug trafficking profits, to
assassinate Honduran President Roberto Suazo in 1984.
   Two others involved in the unsuccessful plot received long
sentences, but Bueso Rosa got off with a five-year term after the
U.S. officials interceded for him, said McNeil.
   At least one reason for the intervention was the general's
``past usefulness to the Contra program,'' he said.
   The State Department censored part of McNeil's testimony which
detailed how Abrams at one point in 1986 urged that Noriega be
pressured from power because of his drug-related activities, but
later changed his mind after apparently becoming convinced Noriega
was essential to the Contra policy.
   While the testimony was blacked out on copies of McNeil's
statement, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., referred to it and read
part of it in open session.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley today denied that
Abrams had sought to help Bueso Rosa get a lighter sentence or a
pardon, saying he simply went along with a judge's recommendation
that the general be allowed to serve his time at a minimum security
prison. And she said McNeil, because he did not formulate
Panamanian policy, was ``not in a position to comment credibly'' on
any change of heart by Abrams toward Noriega.
   The subcommittee also heard testimony Monday that Noriega
probably has evidence of U.S. officials' complicity in Central
American drug trafficking and is using it to buy time.
   Jose I. Blandon, a former intelligence official and consul
general for Panama who defected last year, produced a document
Noriega sent to the country's U.S. diplomatic offices in February
saying he has proof that American officials knowingly established
policies that supported people involved in the drug business.
   ``General Noriega says he has proof of the involvement of (U.S.)
government authorities in drugs in Central America,'' Blandon said
in Spanish through an interpreter at the hearing of the
subcommittee on narcotics. Blandon mentioned trafficking in Panama,
Guatemala and Costa Rica.
   Asked by the subcommittee chairman, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
whether he believes Noriega actually has such proof, Blandon
answered, ``Yes.''
   Later, Kerry said he, too, believes that Noriega has potentially
embarrassing information about U.S. officials and is using it to
try to maintain himself in power in Panama.
   Kerry said he did not pursue the matter more extensively in the
public hearing because he is still awaiting corroboration of that
and other information about alleged use of airstrips used to
resupply the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in Nicaragua to handle drug
shipments as well.
   ``It's significant enough that it's going to create a stir,''
Kerry said, noting that the information involves an Israeli
citizen, Michael Harare, who used airstrips in the region to help
resupply the Contras.
   While Congress is in recess, Kerry scheduled a full week of
hearings on U.S. anti-drug efforts in Central America. He said a
series of witnesses would piece together a mosaic that portrays
U.S. foreign policy interests in the region, such as support for
the Contras, as frequently taking precedence over the war on drugs.
   ``One thing that leaps out is that despite all the rhetoric ...
and the talk about a war on drugs, there has not been a real war,''
Kerry said.

   A small U.S. Army helicopter
crashed in southern West Germany today, killing the American pilot
and a West German U.S. Army employee, the Army said.
   There were no other casualties in the 9 a.m. crash near Nabern,
25 miles southeast of Stuttgart, according to a statement by the
Stuttgart-based U.S. Army 7th Corps.
   The statement identified the dead pilot as 1st Lt. Glen P.
Adams, 28, who was assigned to Headquarters Company, 4th Battalion,
159th Aviation, 11th Aviation Brigade, in Schwaebisch Hall, near
Stuttgart. The Army could not provide his hometown. Adams is
survived by his wife.
   The second victim was a West German employee of the U.S. Army,
who was a passenger on the aircraft, the statement said. His name
was being withheld until his next of kin had been notified, the
Army said.
   A board of officers from the U.S. Army Safety Center, Fort
Rucker, Ala., was scheduled to arrive in West Germany Wednesday to
investigate the cause of the crash of the OH-58A Kiowa helicopter,
the statement added.
   ``The helicopter was on a routine support mission. There were no
weapons or ammunition on board,'' U.S. Army spokeswoman Hilda
Goodhand said in a telephone interview.
   Stuttgart police said the helicopter went down in an open area,
apparently after running into tree branches in a heavy fog. U.S.
military officials immediately cordoned off the site.
   It was the third crash of a NATO military aircraft in less than
a week.
   A French Mirage jet fighter crashed on March 30 one mile from a
nuclear power plant in the southern state of Bavaria, killing the
pilot.
   One day later, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed into
the southern town of Forst, demolishing three houses and killing a
resident and the pilot.

<HEAD>Thousands of Villages to Vanish to Get More Land For State Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian officials have spelled out plans
to erase 7,000 villages and form big agricultural-industrial
centers by the year 2000, a move that critics of the regime say
will ruin traditional country life.
   The huge project unveiled last month by Romanian Communist Party
leader Nicolae Ceausescu calls for radical cuts in the number of
villages, from 13,000 to only 5,000 or 6,000.
   A statement published March 4 in the party daily Scinteia said
the move aims ``to eradicate basic differences betweeen villages
and cities and ensure the harmonious development of all areas of
the country.''
   Romanian officials writing in the government press say the
program is intended to gain about 765,600 acres of land for use by
state-owned collective farms.
   They say this will be achieved by banning construction of
one-family homes and concentrating several families in city-style
apartment blocks.
   Thousands of such apartment blocks _ many with only rudimentary
amenities _ have been built since 1986, when a new systematization
law on getting more farmland was passed.
   Families put into such apartment blocks lose their traditional
small plots, which are regarded as a staple provider of food in the
shortage-plagued Communist nation, and they must use communal
facilities to grow food and raise livestock.
   About 8,300 apartments were built in 15 rural communities around
Bucharest last year, according to official figures.
   ``The entire project amounts to the destruction of villages, the
traditional family cell of Romanians,'' said Mihnea Berindei, a
Romanian emigre living in Paris, in a telephone interview with the
Associated Press on Tuesday.
   Berindei, who is spokesman of the Paris-based League for the
Defense of Human Rights in Romania, said thousands of churches also
were threatened with demolition under the ``systematization
plans,'' the official title for the project to reduce the number of
villages.
   ``This project has no equivalent in Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   In 1981, Ceausescu launched a ``new agricultural revolution''
aimed at boosting disappointing cereal outputs, the source of
widespread food shortages and rationing.
   Romanian agriculture has been plagued by lack of incentives,
fodder shortages for private livestock and a system of contracting
which forces farmers to sell their produce to the state under
obligatory contracts against low prices.
   Despite official promises in December to enable each Romanian to
buy about 13 pounds of meat a month on average, meat is still
rationed to a little more than two pounds per capita a month and is
in short supply, Romanian sources say.
   Addressing a conference of local government officials in
Bucharest on March 3, Ceausescu announced the villages project will
entail the merger of scores of villages and communes into 558
agricultural-industrial centers, viewed as communities linking
rural and town life.
   The nationwide undertaking is likely to lead to the relocation
of hundreds of thousands of villagers from old family homes to
two-or three-story apartment blocks with communal kitchens and
sanitary installations.
   Ceausescu urged in his speech that doctors, teachers and farm
engineers who live in nearby towns and commute daily to the
villages where they are employed should move into the rural
apartment blocks starting this year.
   Some apartments destined for the ``village intelligentsia'' have
already been built and officials say the program will be completed
by 1989.
   Half of Romania's population of 23 million resides in the
country, according to official figures. The collectivized
agriculture is almost fully state-owned, except for 9 percent of
farmland permitted to peasants as small private plots around their
homes or in hilly areas where collectivization was not possible.

   The government on Tuesday decided to
train scientists to serve as astronauts in a Soviet space flight.
   Austria will also build a satellite under the plan, which calls
for Austrian participation in several Soviet space projects.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov raised the idea in June on a
visit to Vienna.
   Possible candidates for Austrian participation in a space flight
will be sought through newspaper and trade journal advertisements.
The education in the Soviet Union is to last two years, the Austria
Press Agency reported.
   Austrian scientists have already made proposals for space
experiments, and researchers at Technical University in Graz are
working on a small satellite to place outside the Soviet space
station ``Mir.''
   The cost of Austrian participation in a Soviet space mission,
tentatively set for 1992, was estimated at $13 million.

   An explosion in a hold of the cargo
ship Michele Damato severely burned seven workers and touched off a
fire today, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
   The agency said there were no injures among the dozens of other
people aboard the ship at the time of the blast in this port city
about 30 miles west of Genoa.
   Initial reports said eight people had been severely burned, but
ANSA later said only seven were injured.
   ANSA reported officials said they believe the blast was
triggered by gas fumes that seeped into the hold where welders were
working.
   Firefighters extinguished the flames that threatened to spread
to other parts of the vessel moored at the port's coal unloading
terminal, the agency said.

   Presidential contenders Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson headed
into battle in today's Wisconsin primary on the heels of an
inconclusive contest in Colorado. Jackson blasted the Colorado
state chairman for ``biased and politically unethical'' actions in
the slow-moving count.
   Monday night's Colorado caucuses were a see-saw battle that saw
first one and then the other gain the upper hand. When the state
Democratic Party quit counting early this morning, Dukakis had 46
percent to Jackson's 40 percent, with just under half the precincts
reporting.
   However, when the counting resumed today, Jackson gained ground,
lagging behind Dukakis 42 percent to 44 percent.
   Dukakis had grabbed an early lead Monday night in the Colorado
contest. But Jackson quickly caught up and even passed him when
Denver results began coming in. Then Dukakis pulled ahead again.
   Today in Kenosha, Wis., Jackson complained that the dribble of
caucus results from Colorado could have been delayed to give the
appearance of a lead for Dukakis. Colorado Democratic chairman Buie
Seawell, a Dukakis supporter, directed the count.
   ``This long and slow count represents a certain ineptness ... it
heightens suspicions,'' Jackson said. ``You cannot very well be a
fair referee and coaching another player.''
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. lagged far behind with 4 percent,
and Sen. Paul Simon didn't get enough votes to count.
   Simon, his campaign fading, said he hoped to score with
Wisconsin's voters today. But he added: ``If we don't do well, we
have to make a re-evaluation. We'll take one step at a time.''
Pre-primary polls put Simon a distant fourth in Wisconsin.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush sailed to a
strong lead in Colorado's GOP straw polls.
   While voters were calling the shots in Wisconsin today, the
candidates scattered to regroup for big-state contests coming up in
New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio in the next month.
   Dukakis sounded upbeat as he awaited the verdict in Wisconsin.
``It looks good,'' he said as he arrived home in Boston Monday
night. ``We worked hard.''
   The four Democratic presidential hopefuls campaigned Monday
across Wisconsin, with Jackson getting heat from rivals for his
contact with Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Dukakis joined the criticism of Jackson. But that didn't stop
Gore from saying the Massachusetts governor ``gives the impression
of being scared to death'' to take on Jackson.
   Dukakis, in turn, icily suggested Gore spend more time
campaigning for votes and less time criticizing other candidates.
   Although Bush has the GOP nomination wrapped up, former
television evangelist Pat Robertson still contested Colorado, with
its 36 delegates at stake.
   Jackson and Dukakis made weekend campaign swings to Colorado
trying to rally support for 2,784 precinct caucuses that began the
state's delegate-selection process.
   Jackson's enthusiastic crowds on Saturday and Sunday were taken
as an indication of his strength. But Dukakis had the backing of
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and state Democratic chairman Buie Seawell.
   The Democratic front-runners are locked in a close delegate
battle nationally, meaning Colorado's 45 national convention
delegates were a prize well worth pursuing.
   Before Colorado, Dukakis had 671.55 votes and Jackson 665.55.
Gore had 381.8 and Simon 170.5. A total of 508.6 were uncommitted.
At the Atlanta convention in July, 2,082 votes are needed to win.
   Today's Wisconsin primary was the week's big prize.
   Not only are at 81 Democratic delegates at stake, but the state
offered a chance for each of the candidates to make a crucial point.
   Dukakis sought a win in a big Midwestern primary to demonstrate
his campaign is back on track after losses in Illinois and
Michigan. Jackson looked to demonstrate that he could keep his
momentum going, and win a big state with a small black population
on the strength of major white support.
   Gore made major television buys to try to make a splash before
the New York primary on April 19, the do-or-die contest for him.
And Simon needed a victory or something close to it to avoid
withdrawing from the race later this week.
   Monday's campaigning was marked by quarreling among the
Democrats about who had said what and who had done what.
   Much of the attention focused on Jackson, who made public
Noriega's reply to his March 22 letter asking the Panamanian
strongman to give up power. Noriega refused and Jackson restated
his plea.
   ``I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the
Panamanian people for Gen. Noriega to leave. Today I reiterate my
public moral appeal for him to depart,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson's actions drew criticism inside the campaign and outside.
   ``I think it's a bad idea for a private citizen to try to inject
himself'' into a delicate international situation, Dukakis said.
But he said he believed Jackson's intentions were good.
   That's more than Gore gave Jackson credit for. ``I seriously
doubt if he would help in Panama,'' the Tennessee senator said.
   And the State Department added its criticism as well.
   ``In our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that Noriega
likes to use to buy time,'' said department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley.
   But Gore didn't make Jackson his only target.
   ``Michael Dukakis gives the impression of being scared to
death'' to criticize Jackson and appears ``absolutely timid,'' Gore
said.
   Dukakis was clearly irritated.
   ``Sen. Gore ought to start campaigning for the presidency,'' he
retorted, pointing to Gore's lack of success since Super Tuesday.

<HEAD>Exiled Stage Director Enthusiastic About Moscow Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exiled director Yuri Lyubimov
said Tuesday he was looking forward to seeing friends, former
colleagues, and the Taganka Theater when he visits to Moscow next
month.
   Lyubimov, in an interview with The Associated Press, stressed
that his first visit to the Soviet Union in almost five years was
still pending government approval.
   ``I do not have a visa or an official invitation yet,'' Lyubimov
told the AP, speaking in Russian and using a German-speaking
interpreter.
   Lyubimov, founder of Moscow's Taganka Theater and director there
until his exile, was invited by the theater to preside in May over
final rehearsals of ``Boris Godunov,'' the controversial piece that
led to his exile and expulsion from the Communist Party.
   ``I'm very much looking forward to seeing friends, actors, and
the Taganka Theater,'' said Lyubimov, 70, adding that he would only
spend about 10 days in the Soviet Union.
   ``I would only spend about 10 days there,'' he said.
   He did not, however, rule out possibly working in Moscow again
in the future.
   ``I have various contracts to work in Western Europe and in
Israel for the next few years,'' Lyubimov told the AP. ``But there
are time gaps between those engagements when I could possibly work
in Moscow.''
   The Taganka's deputy director, Alexander M. Yefimovich, said
Monday in Moscow that Lyubimov would be coming for a brief working
visit.
   Lyubimov, who is working on a production of Richard Wagner's
``Tannhaeuser'' in Stuttgart, said he was invited to Moscow last
week by Taganka Theater director Nikolai Gubenko in Madrid, where
the troupe was performing Maxim Gorky's ``Mother.''
   The director declined to give the dates of his Moscow visit.
   He is, however, expected to stay in Stuttgart at least until the
May 7 premiere of ``Tannhaeuser,'' said Stuttgart Theater
spokeswoman Annemarie Gross.
   Lyubimov, who founded the Taganka Theater and made it famous
with its avant-garde productions and controversial themes, battled
with censors throughout much of his career in Moscow.
   In July 1983 he went to London to direct Fyodor Dostoyevsky's
``Crime and Punishment.'' He extended his stay, demanding
assurances that he would be allowed artistic freedom once back in
the Soviet Union.
   The director was fired from the Taganka in March 1984 and
expelled from the Communist Party. He lives in Jerusalem with his
wife, Katalin, and son, Peter. He became an Israeli citizen this
year.
   Since his departure from Moscow he has been staging productions
around the world. His plans for the next few years include
productions in Britain, Sweden, and Israel, Lyubimov said.

   In case anyone had any doubts, the staff
preparing ``USA Today: The Television Show'' for its fall debut
demonstrated Tuesday that the video version of the national
newspaper will mirror the publication that spawned it.
   At a news conference at the newspaper's offices just outside
Washington, the executive producer and four hosts of the program
discussed a show they said will offer segments that people find
interesting and understandable, graphics that will glitter and
stories that will supplement _ not compete with _ the network news.
   ``If we can't do it better or different, we're not going to do
it,'' the show's executive producer, Steve Friedman, said. ``Once
you've looked at a burning ship in the Persian Gulf four or five
times, you don't want to look at it any more.''
   The nighttime show premieres Sept. 12. It will run for 30
minutes every weeknight and have an hour-long weekend edition. Like
the newspaper, it will have segments devoted to news, lifestyle,
sports and business, focusing on articles that will appear in USA
Today the next morning.
   Friedman said the producers so far had 118 firm contracts with
television stations across the country to broadcast the program,
covering 85 percent of the country. Those agreements make the show
more available to early evening viewers than any program with the
exception of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' said Friedman, who guided NBC's
``Today'' show for nearly a decade.
   The team selected to host the program include Edie Magnus, hired
from ABC News's ``World News This Morning'' to anchor the
``Front-Page'' segment; and Robin Young, a former contributing
correspondent for NBC's ``Nightly News'' and ``Today'' shows who
will host the ``Life Section.''
   In addition, Bill Macatee, a former NBC News sports reporter,
will host the show's ``Sports Section,'' while former ABC News
White House correspondent Kenneth Walker has been hired to anchor
the ``Money Section.''
   ``We have a pretty much open mandate to do what we find
interesting,'' Macatee said.
   As examples of what the show may offer, Macatee said segments
could include allowing baseball fan and former President Richard
Nixon to call the final out of a World Series game.
   ``Or let's have the head of an airline dress like a pilot for a
day to see how it fits, see how people react,'' he said.
   The hosts, whom Friedman described as ``my dream team,'' not
only would introduce segments but report many of them.
   ``A lot of people can report,'' Friedman said. ``A lot of people
can read a TelePrompTer. Very few people can do both.''
   Friedman also said the show would rely heavily on reporters for
the newspaper, with television cameras brought into the paper's
newsroom for interviews with the writers.
   He said that if a reporter for the paper had an exclusive
interview with a news subject, he might be asked on camera, ``What
was that person really like close up? Did you see the kids?''
   The news conference _ featuring a 12-minute demonstration tape _
was the first of six also to be held in New York, Detroit, Chicago,
Dallas and Los Angeles over a fast-moving three days that Friedman
said he is calling the ``Prop-capade.''
   The reference was to series of USA Today articles based on
cross-country and global trips, dubbed ``Bus-Capade'' and
``Jet-Capade,'' by Allen H. Neuharth, chairman of the Gannett Co.,
which publishes the newspaper.
   The program is produced by GTG Entertainment, a partnership
between Grant Tinker, the former NBC chairman of the board and
independent producer, and Gannett. Gannett, the country's largest
newspaper chain, owns 90 daily papers, 10 television stations and
16 radio stations.

   A fire on Tuesday swept through a

authorities said.
   The fire at the Leber Mount Hotel at this popular resort
apparently began on the ground floor of the four-story building,
said Fire Superintendent Richard Taylor, The cause was not known,
he said.
   The hotel had been divided into self-contained apartments,
according to a spokeswoman for the Lancashire Constabulary, the

   It was not known how many people were in the building at the
time.
   ``The whole scene was absolutely chaotic. There must have been
about 10 children inside the building. The people who live there
often leave their kids unattended,'' said Elizabeth Atkins, who
worked in a hairdresser's shop in the hotel.

<HEAD>Soul Singer Free On Bond On Assault With Intent To Murder Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soul singer James Brown turned himself in
Tuesday after being charged with beating up his wife and shooting
up her car while she cowered inside.
   ``He beat her up real bad; she's got bruises all over her. He
also shot up her car,'' Aiken County Sheriff Carrol Heath said.
   Brown, 54, is charged with assault with intent to murder and
assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. He was
released on $15,000 bond.
   Heath said Brown's wife, Adrienne Lois Brown, 38, told
authorities Brown shot at her car while she was inside and later
beat her with a pipe.
   Brown denied the charges. He said he and his wife had argued
because he was leaving without her Thursday for a South American
tour.
   Brown, a two-time Grammy winner, is famous for such soul music
hits as ``Please, Please, Please,'' ``It's a Man's World,''
``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag'' and ``Living in America.''
   Heath said the incident occurred late Sunday or early Monday at
the Browns' residence near Beech Island, S.C.
   ``I never laid a hand on her. I can tell you it's over now.
She's not coming back to my house,'' Brown said.
   An investigator's report said four bullets hit the car, three in
the rear and one under a headlight. Mrs. Brown was not hit by the
gunfire.
   Mrs. Brown, who said she planned to file for a legal separation,
said she and the singer have been married for eight years.
   ``I didn't do anything to provoke him, no sir,'' said Mrs.
Brown. ``This is not the first time he's done this. He's knocked
out all my teeth.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are eating too much animal fat and
government regulations make it difficult for the food industry to
market leaner and more healthful meats and dairy products, a
scientific panel said Tuesday.
   Although consumption of animal fat has gone down, many Americans
still are eating their way to poor health with too much
cholesterol, fatty acids and salt, and not enough foods that
provide the needed calcium and iron said a report by a committee of
the National Research Council.
   It said ``the incidence of nutrition-related health problems is
significant, affecting either directly or indirectly nearly every
American family.''
   Among the diet-related health problems cited:
   _About 34 million Americans are overweight.
   _Nearly a million adults die annually of cardiovascular disease
that may be related to the consumption of high-cholesterol foods.
   _Osteoporosis, a disease caused by leaching of calcium from
bone, strikes 15 to 20 million adults.
   _Between 8 million and 12 million children are hungry because of
inadequate diets.
   _Iron deficiency is the most common form of childhood anemia.
   The chairman of the panel, David L. Call of Cornell University,
told reporters that animal products are a ``mixed blessing
nutritionally'' in the American diet.
   ``In our food supply, they (animal products) provide about 36
percent of our food energy and between 36 percent and 100 percent
of certain nutrients,'' he said.
   ``At the same time, however, animal products contribute more
than half of the total fat, nearly three-fourths of the saturated
fatty acids and all of the dietary cholesterol.''
   A change in some government regulations, along with education of
consumers and technological advances by manufacturers of animal
food products could correct the problems relatively quickly, said
Timothy Hammonds of the supermarket industry's Food Marketing
Institute, a member of the committee.
   ``In the future, the consumers could have it all,'' with more
healthful meats and dairy products that provide the needed
nutrition without excess fats and cholesterol, Hammonds said.
   The key, he said, is changes in the government regulations that
would provide an economic incentive to producers to change their
products.
   Among the changes recommended:
   _Permitting packers to trim fat from animal carcasses at the
slaughter plant. This system, called ``hot fat trimming,'' would
encourage meat producers to grow beef and lambs that are leaner
because they no longer would be rewarded for the fat added to the
carcasses through heavy feeding and feed supplements.
   ``Packers would like to trim the fat, but they can't do that
because government regulations won't let them,'' said committee
member Gary C. Smith of Texas A&M University.
   The Agriculture Department, which controls meat grading, has
issued proposed `hot fat trimming'' rules for comment by the
industry.
   _Reducing what Call said is ``fuzziness'' in marketing terms
identifying meats and dairy products that have reduced fats or
other nutritional changes. The current system approved by the Food
and Drug Administration bases product identification in some cases
on fat content, Call said. Some frozen desserts, for example,
cannot be called ice cream because of a reduced fat content.
   Bologna, sausage and mayonnaise also must have certain levels of
fat or else be labeled as imitations, Call noted.
   As another example, Hammond of the Food Marketing Institute said
dairies can reduce the amount of salt in cheeses, but when the
product is marketed it cannot be called ``cheese'' because its
reduced salt content does not meet the FDA standard.
   The committee also asked for more precise standards for the use
of such meat marketing terms as ``lite,'' ``light'' and ``lean.''
   _Developing technology to determine the lean-to-fat ratio of
food animals while they are still on the hoof or shortly after
slaughter. The committee suggested this might be done with
electronic sensors now are used in medicine.
   _Encouraging research in genetics or feed supplement technology
that would produce leaner meats.
   Smith of Texas A&M said the industry has made ``remarkable
progress'' in producing leaner meats during the last two decades.
   Pork producers, he said, have made the most progress because a
meat grading system for swine has provided incentives to reward
leanness. Similar incentives would contribute to changes among beef
and lamb producers, he said.
   Committee member Scott M. Grundy, a nutrition scientist at the
University of Texas, said that despite the potential health
problems, animal products consumed in appropriate portions are
essential parts of the diet.
   Meat and dairy products are important sources of such nutrients
as calcium and iron and the primary source of some proteins, he
said.
   The National Research Council is an arm of the
government-supported National Science Foundation.

<HEAD>New York Primary Even More Pivotal for Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's primary, with its prize of 255
delegates and its reluctant governor, takes on even more importance
in the next two weeks as the Democratic presidential race staggers
out of the Midwest without a leader.
   ``Tomorrow it's really going to get crazy,'' said John Marino, a
top New York party official, on Tuesday.
   At stake for the Democrats in New York is a national convention
delegation second in size only to California's 336-member entourage.
   And looming over the primary is Gov. Mario Cuomo, reluctant to
run for president himself but equally reluctant to anoint any other
Democrat.
   Cuomo's coyness has fueled speculation for months about the
prospect of a deadlocked convention and desperate Democrats turning
to him with the nomination. As the primaries and caucuses unfolded
and the Democrats remained without a front-runner, Cuomo's refusal
to endorse a candidate or rule out a convention draft prompted a
new round of rumors.
   There is also a Republican primary on April 19 in New York with
102 delegates at stake, but it is considered little more than a
formality as Vice President George Bush rolls toward the GOP
nomination.
   The outcome of the New York primary for Democrats, however,
could provide answers to questions raised by the earlier primaries,
including:
   _Can Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis get his campaign rolling
enough to again convince party leaders that he deserves the
nomination? He campaigned in New York Tuesday even before the
Wisconsin polls closed.
   _Can Jesse Jackson's solid support among minority voters and the
backing of several prominent New York labor leaders overcome Jewish
uneasiness and produce a New York victory?
   _Will Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s decision to put most of
his remaining eggs in the New York basket prove to be anything more
than a nice post-Easter gift for some television stations and one
well-known political consultant?
   Along with Cuomo, most of the state's other major Democrats,
such as New York City Mayor Edward Koch and Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, are remaining neutral. Koch has said he wants to go to
the national convention as leader of a draft-Cuomo movement.
   While some Democrats have said they want Cuomo to get into the
race now, his top political advisers insist that's not about to
happen.
   ``He is as staunch as he's ever been,'' said Cuomo political
adviser Meyer Frucher of the governor's reaction to such
entreaties. ``The more you argue with him, the more adamant he
gets.''
   The New York primary ballot will include a pro-Cuomo uncommitted
delegate slate arranged by a group of elected upstate Democratic
county clerks who want to see the governor in the race. Cuomo has
disavowed any connection with the effort.
   For his part, Cuomo has said he and other party leaders should
round up enough extra votes after the last primaries to guarantee
the nomination to the front-runner at that point, whoever it is.
   At the moment, Marino said the edge in New York has to go to
Jackson because of his strong support among blacks and Hispanics.
   ``I don't care what any poll says ... Jackson has the strongest
base,'' said the Cuomo political operative.
   Recent polls among New York Democrats have Dukakis leading the
field with support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent, depending
on the poll. Jackson has been consistently second at just under 30
percent while Gore and Simon have yet to crack double digits in any
of the polls.
   While Marino says New York is important to all the candidates,
the state party's executive director said ``Al Gore has to win this
state outright'' to remain viable.
   Gore has hired New York political consultant David Garth, who
runs Koch's campaigns and who occasionally advises Cuomo. Gore will
spend more than $1 million in New York, much of it for television
advertising.
   Gore, striving to make an impact with New York's politically
important Jewish community, has been attacking Jackson and Dukakis
on the issue of support for Israel. If Gore's message has an impact
it could hurt Dukakis most; Jackson's support among New York Jews
is minimal following his ``Hymietown'' gaffe in 1984.
   Jackson is relying on his strong minority support, coupled with
a growing acceptance among white voters, to win more than the 26
percent he garnered in 1984.
   Jackson plans a big television purchase in New York, a tool he
hasn't used much in other states. He also has the support of
influential labor leaders such as Stanley Hill, executive director
of the 120,000-member New York City municipal workers union, and
Jan Pierce, a top official with the Communications Workers of
America.
   According to Marino, Jackson and Dukakis have the best
organizations. Dukakis also has the most money to spend, possibly
as much as $3 million, for the New York effort.

   Multimillionaire Malcolm Forbes is not
pointing a finger at anyone, even though he might have a reason to
be piqued at Outlaw Biker magazine for creative cropping of his
photo.
   The magazine's May issue shows a smiling Forbes on its cover,
pointing his middle finger at the camera.
   The magazine, which features topless women, tattoo artists and
bikers in black leather, carries a 10-page piece on the publisher
of Forbes magazine, himself an avid biker.
   A Forbes publicist said Monday his 68-year-old boss did not pose
in the obscene manner depicted on the cover, but said the image was
cropped from a photo that had shown him with actress Elizabeth
Taylor showing off the skull-and-crossbones rings they exchanged in
New Jersey in July.
   Forbes' ring is on his middle finger.
   The piece was largely complimentary, but publicist Donald Garson
said Forbes ``didn't expect that they would do what they did. Is he
shocked? No.''

   Actor Harry Hamlin says he still distrusts
publicity after he made a lot of tabloid headlines during the early
part of his career.
   In the April 9 issue of TV Guide, Hamlin tells about a story
based on a visit he made to a Beverly Hills men's store in 1979. At
the time, he was living in Italy with actress Ursula Andress, 15
years his senior.
   Hamlin, who plays lawyer Michael Kuzak on ``L.A. Law,'' said the
story claimed he could not find a tie with a palm tree on it so he
bought a $400 surfer shirt and had his tailor make a tie from it.
   ``Then I told the proprietor that I'd just sent $10,000 worth of
toy trains to my son in Rome and that his mother was fit to be tied
because she had to make an addition to her mansion,'' he said the
story claimed.
   When he went back to the store a few weeks later, Hamlin said a
clerk assured him the person responsible for the story had been
fired.
   ``I told him I didn't take it seriously and I left. Sure enough,
two weeks later, there's the article: `Furious Harry Hamlin storms
into store, screaming at one salesperson after another, demanding
to know who leaked story.'''

   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato and Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci disagreed today on whether D'Amato had called
Carlucci a coward because he is not doing enough to get rid of
Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   D'Amato, R-N.Y., released a letter from Carlucci that referred
to a telephone conversation the two had last week. In the letter,
Carlucci wrote:
   ``You charge that I, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are
`cowards' and that we are `supporting a drug dealer'.''
   Carlucci said he had ``been reflecting on your emotion-charged
telephone call'' and that the senator's charges ``are unwarranted
and insulting.''
   The defense secretary wrote: ``I hope you can indicate to me
that you did not mean them as stated. I have shown this letter to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.''
   In releasing Carlucci's letter, D'Amato's spokesman, Jack
Kinnicutt, said that D'Amato ``apparently called Carlucci a
coward'' in the telephone conversation. ``I wasn't sitting in on
(the phone call) but from what I hear, boy, it was hot,'' Kinnicutt
said.
   Hours later, D'Amato said through another spokesman ``I did not
call Carlucci a coward. My recollection of the conversation was
that (I said) the inaction would be perceived as cowardly.''
   D'Amato, in a subsequent letter sent to Carlucci today, said he
did not ``believe that the Joint Chiefs of Staff are cowards. There
is no doubt, however, that the lack of U.S. action in Panama has
made us appear weak in many people's eyes.''
   At a news conference today, D'Amato said he had told Carlucci:
``We are being perceived as cowards, lacking the resolve to deal
with a drug dealer, a tinhorn drug dealer by the name of Noriega.
It's not a question of questioning anybody's particular manhood or
the patriotism of the joint chiefs. As a matter of fact, I never
mentioned the joint chiefs in that matter...''
   Kinnicutt said that during the phone call, D'Amato complained
that Carlucci was willing to send 3,200 soldiers to Honduras but
would not send a senior military officer to Panama to tell Noriega
to get out.
   Carlucci's letter did not address the substance of D'Amato's
complaint, that the U.S. government had sent a mere deputy
assistant secretary of state to Panama ``to impress this thug,''
meaning Noriega.
   The assistant secretary, William Walker, visited Noriega _ who
is under a U.S. drug trafficking indictment _ on March 21 and told
him, according to D'Amato, that Noriega's continued presence in
Panama is untenable.
   ``Noriega laughed at him,'' D'Amato told the Buffalo (N.Y.)
News. ``We should have sent somebody with military authority,
somebody who represents military power. That's the only thing
(Noriega) understands.''

17 pro-Iranian prisoners held in Kuwait. That is the same demand
made by Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems holding foreign hostages in
Lebanon.
   Three members of Kuwait's royal Al-Sabah family and one
passenger with an American passport reportedly were aboard the
Boeing 747, which was hijacked to Mashhad in northeastern Iran on a
flight from Bangkok to Kuwait.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the hijackers
allowed a Jordanian passenger with a heart condition off the
aircraft after it was surrounded by Iranian security troops.
   It quoted the passenger, business executive Mustafa Issa, 42, as
saying five or six hijackers armed with pistols and hand grenades
seized the plane three hours after it took off from Bangkok.
   Kuwait urged Iran to handle the incident ``wisely'' and
requested that the aircraft not be allowed to take off. But IRNA
quoted Issa as saying the hijackers were insisting on flying on to
an undetermined destination.
   It quoted him as saying he heard them say they ``hijacked the
aircraft in order to vindicate their denied rights from the Kuwaiti
government.''
   Iran first denied the plane permission to land, but reversed its
decision when the pilot said the jet was running out of fuel, IRNA
said.
   The agency said the hijackers demanded fuel and threatened to
blow up the aircraft if ``any person should attempt to approach
it.''
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran told Tehran Radio he was
trying to ``resolve the incident peacefully to save the lives of
the people on board.''
   He sent his deputy for political affairs, Ali Reza Moayyeri, to
Mashhad, said the broadcast, monitored in Nicosia.
   Kuwaiti Airways said Flight 422 was carrying 97 passengers and
15 crew members.
   Elias H. Shiber, the airline's manager in Bangkok, said the
passenger list included 30 Kuwaitis, 22 Britons, eight Thais,
various other nationalities and one person with both an American
and Egyptian passport. The airline identified him as R.
Attiaallaali.
   Shiber said the three members of Kuwait's ruling family aboard
were Ibtesam Khaled Al-Sabah, Fadil Khaled Al-Sabah and the wife of
Khaled Anwar Al-Sabah. Hundreds of Kuwaitis are related to Kuwait's
emir.
   IRNA said the aircraft landed in Mashhad at 7:30 a.m. (midnight
EDT) and completed refueling three hours later.
   The Iranian agency said the hijackers spoke in Arabic and
identified themselves as Arabs.
   The Kuwait News Agency quoted a spokesman for the airline as
saying contact was lost with the aircraft while it flew over
Muscat, Oman. And an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the
plane flew into Iranian airspace from the direction of the Gulf of
Oman.
   In Kuwait, a government spokesman said the Foreign Ministry
summoned Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammed Faroughy and told him
``Kuwait is confident that the concerned Iranian authorities will
handle the issue wisely, in a manner that ensures the safety of the
passengers, the crew and the plane.''
   The unidentified Kuwaiti government spokesman told the Kuwait
News Agency, ``Kuwait also asked the Iranian government not to
allow the airliner to take off from Iran and to take all measures
necessary to prevent such takeoff.''
   Diplomatic relations between Iran and Kuwait have been strained
since August when Iranians stormed the embassies of Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia in Tehran. Kuwait closed its embassy in Tehran and
brought its diplomats home. Later Kuwait limited the number of
Iranians at Iran's Embassy in Kuwait to two.
   Pro-Iranian gunmen hijacked a Kuwaiti Airways jetliner to Tehran
in December 1984. They killed two American passengers before
Iranian commandos stormed the aircraft, ending the six-day ordeal.
   At the time, the hijackers demanded the release of Kuwaitis
jailed in the 1983 bombings that targeted U.S. and French embassies
in Kuwait. The Kuwait government refused to negotiate. Shiites
holding foreign hostages in Lebanon also have demanded the 17
prisoners' release.
   Dozens of Shiite terrorists, most of them either of Iranian
descent or loyal to its Islamic Revolution, have been arrested and
convicted of sabotage in the past five years. The overwhelming
majority of Iran's population is Shiite.
   In the Persian Gulf Arab states, Sunni Moslems dominate the
government.
   Kuwait is the closest Arab nation to Iran and Iraq, which are
locked in a 7{-year-old war. Iran has often accused Kuwait of
actively aiding Iraq's military effort.

   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, locked in a
grind-it-out struggle for the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination, faced off Tuesday in the Wisconsin primary. Dukakis led
his rival narrowly in a slow count from the Colorado caucuses.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. spent heavily in Wisconsin and sought an
elusive breakthrough outside his native South. Sen. Paul Simon
struggled for survival, with several big industrial states still to
come, beginning with New York on April 19.
   Vice President George Bush won Colorado handily and faced only
nominal opposition in Wisconsin as he continued his grand march
toward nomination at the Republican National Convention this summer.
   With returns compiled from 51 percent of Colorado's precincts,
Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis was winning 44 percent of the vote.
Jackson, the man with momentum in the race since his smashing
Michigan landslide 10 days ago, had 42 percent. Gore had 3 percent.
Dukakis had 3,035 county delegates to Jackson's 2,915.
   Jackson complained that party officials who favored Dukakis were
manipulating the slow count. ``It heightens suspicions,'' he said.
``It's beyond explanation.''
   Early Republican straw poll numbers from Colorado's caucuses
Monday night showed Bush with 1,288 votes, or 78 percent, and
former television evangelist Pat Robertson with 136, or 8 percent.
   But Wisconsin loomed as a far more important test than Colorado
in the see-saw Democratic struggle, partially because it offered
more delegates _ 81 compared with Colorado's 45. Democratic rivals
invested heavily in time and money in their bid to claim the
support of Wisconsin's large blue collar vote and gain fresh
momentum for the rest of the primary season.
   Dukakis held a shaky lead over Jackson in pre-election surveys
in overwhelmingly white Wisconsin, with Tennessee Sen. Gore a
distant third. Illinois Sen. Simon lagged with single-digit support
in the polls and seemed likely to suspend his campaign if he fared
poorly.
   For the Democrats, Wisconsin turned out to be a surprisingly
important test in their nominating wars, a gauge of a struggling
Dukakis campaign and of Jackson's surprising momentum. It was a
prelude, as well, to delegate-rich primaries in New York,
Pennsylvania and Ohio just ahead.
   Dukakis looked for a victory to silence the critics who said
defeats last month in Illinois and Michigan called into question
his ability to attract the blue collar votes a Democrat needs to
win the White House in the fall election.
   Jackson aimed for a win in a state where only 4 percent of the
voters were black, reckoning that would give him dramatic new
stature in the race.
   Gore spent heavily in television advertising in hopes of
sneaking up on his rivals or at least winning 20 percent of the
popular vote. He needed that much to re-qualify for federal
matching campaign funds.
   Simon said a poor finish would force him to reassess his
candidacy. A decision to suspend rather than withdraw was one
possibility, aides said, a move designed to gain additional
delegates from his homestate of Illinois to be used in any
back-room brokering at the party convention this summer.
   For Republicans, there was no suspense at all.
   Bush ran a television advertising campaign in Wisconsin, but it
was hard to see why. Following Sen. Bob Dole's withdrawal a week
ago, Robertson was his only active rival, and he didn't bother
campaigning in the state.
   Wisconsin had 81 Democratic delegates at stake, with the bounty
parceled out on the basis of popular vote by congressional district.
   Republicans had 47.
   Bush began the day with 841 delegates, out of 1,039 needed for
the nomination. Robertson had 17.
   Dukakis led Jackson, 671.55 to 665.55. Gore had 381.8 delegates
and Simon had 170.5. It takes 2,081 to claim the Democratic
nomination.
   So unpredictable was the Democratic race that campaign aides
said it might hinge on factors entirely beyond their reach.
   Milwaukee picked a new mayor for the first time since 1960, and
the forecast was for an unusually heavy vote in the state's biggest
city.
   Under state rules, Republicans were permitted to cross over and
vote in the Democratic contest. When GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson made
complimentary remarks about Jackson last week, some Democrats
feared that Republicans might do just that mischievously, voting
for the former civil rights leader in the belief that he would be
an easy victim for Bush in November.

   Dukakis and Jackson, competing front-runners in the Democratic
race, approached Wisconsin and its large blue collar vote in
markedly different ways.
   Dukakis used the week following his Connecticut primary victory
to retool his campaign's message and style as he sought to erase
the impression of poor showings in the Illinois primary and
Michigan caucuses. He vowed that he would summon Chrysler Corp.
chairman Lee Iacocca to the White House and jawbone him into
abandoning plans to close a plant in Kenosha. ``I don't want to be
known as the Great Communicator,'' he said in a shot at the
departing President Reagan. ``I weant to be known as a Great
Builder.''
   He revamped his style, as well, serving lunch to senior citizens
one day and visiting a children's hospital on another as he bid to
shed his image as an aloof technocrat.
   He also began gingerly criticizing Jackson, hoping to stall the
former civil rights leader's momentum in the Democratic race. When
Jackson wrote to Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega and
urged him to leave his country, Dukakis said that was a ``bad
idea.''
   Jackson, owner of campaign momentum after his surprise victory
in Michigan, spread his message of hope to the out-of-luck, and
sought to cash in on the time he spent on picket lines when other
contenders were nowhere to be seen.
   ``I have stood with you, now stand with me,'' he implored the
out-of-luck Chrysler workers in Kenosha, meatpackers in Cudahy and
paper mill strikers in DePere.
   ``To win, farmer and worker, rural and urban, black and white
must come together,'' Jackson told more than 2,500 farmers in
Amery, a dairy farming community in northern Wisconsin.
   As evidence of the building interest in Jackson's campaign,
aides disclosed that he raised $2.2 million in contributions last
month, more than he raised in all of 1987.
   Gore criticized Jackson's views on the Mideast in a speech
seemingly aimed more at the New York electorate that will vote in
two weeks than at Wisconsin voters. Then he criticized Dukakis for
failing to criticize Jackson enough.
   ``Michael Dukakis gives the impression of being scared to
death'' to criticize Jackson, Gore said near the end of his
Wisconsin campaigning. ``That is the opposite of bold leadership.''
   Gore spent heavily in television advertising and claimed at the
end that the undecided vote was breaking his way.
   Simon, winner so far only at home in Illinois, staked his
chances on Wisconsin's proud progressive tradition.
   In the style of underdogs everywhere, he urged voters to send a
message that said, ``We're not going to follow the pollsters. We're
going to elect the man best qualified to be president.''

   Rose Mofford, one day after becoming
governor upon Evan Mecham's conviction on impeachment charges,
today took the oath of office. as the state's chief executive.
   Mrs. Mofford, as secretary of state, served as acting governor
since Mecham was impeached by the state House in February.
   ``Let us purge our hearts of suspicion and hate,'' Mrs. Mofford
said in a statement issued Monday. ``I did not ask for this burden.
But I do not shrink from the job before me.''
   She was given the oath during this morning's brief, private
ceremony in the governor's offices by Arizona Supreme Court Chief
Justice Frank X. Gordon Jr., who presided over the impeachment
trial. Justice William A. Holohan held the Bible.
   Mecham's removal from office Monday climaxed 15 months of
turmoil stirred up by what critics called his insensitivity to
minorities and the disorder and corruption that plagued his
administration.
   ``I feel relieved that this nightmare is over,'' Republican Sen.
Greg Lunn said Monday after Mecham, a first-term Republican, became
the first U.S. governor in 59 years to be impeached and stripped of
his office.
   Despite his ouster, Mecham said today he's doing fine.
   Mecham, 63, showed no emotion as the Arizona Senate voted 21-9
to convict him of trying to obstruct an investigation of a alleged
death threat and 26-4 of misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund. Twenty votes were required for conviction.
   Minutes later, he smiled and told reporters, ``Well, they don't
like my politics, so we finished a political trial; it's as simple
as that.''
   Reached by telephone at his home this morning, Mecham said: ``I
don't know why people keep asking how I've been bearing up. I've
never had any trouble bearing up. I've got a clear conscience and I
haven't done anything wrong,''
   ``This job wasn't the end of the world for me,'' he added. ``I
didn't need it in the first place. My main concern is for the
people of Arizona.''
   The 30-member Senate defeated, 17-13, a motion to bar Mecham
from holding any public office again, making it unclear whether he
will be permitted to run in a May 17 recall election to regain the
governor's post. There is no precedent and the matter probably will
be decided by the courts, said Attorney General Bob Corbin.
   Mecham faces an April 21 criminal trial on a charge he concealed
a $350,000 campaign loan. The Senate dropped a charge on that issue
last week.
   Mecham said he did not know what he will do next, including
whether he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. ``We'll know in a
couple, three days,'' he said.
   Mecham was removed less than a week after his family announced
the Mecham Pontiac dealership, which he has owned since 1950, was
being sold because of declining sales his son blamed on an
``avalanche'' of bad publicity.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, Governor Mecham has struck out,''
Democratic Sen. Jesus ``Chuy'' Higuera said as he voted for
conviction on the two counts.
   ``The only defense that we have heard is ignorance of the law,''
Higuera said. ``The citizens of this state will not tolerate this
evil insensitivity to the (Arizona) Constitution and the laws of
the state.''
   Following the vote, some legislators received police protection
because of threatening phone calls, said Department of Public
Safety spokesman Allan Schmidt.
   ``They've been all types of intimidating-type threatening
statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,'' he said.
   The vote ended 15 tumultuous months that shook this staunchly
Republican state and brought ridicule and criticism from
politicians, comedians and the comic strip ``Doonesbury.''
   On his fifth try for governor, Mecham was elected in 1986 in a
three-way race with 40 percent of the vote. He made national
headlines seven days after his inauguration by canceling a Martin
Luther King holiday for state workers on the grounds it was
illegally created by his Democratic predecessor, Bruce Babbitt. He
subsequently offended blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with
offhand remarks and official actions.
   On Feb. 5, the House impeached Mecham, making the 65-year-old
Mrs. Mofford, who had been secretary of state, acting governor.
   Mecham's supporters and opponents gathered all day outside the
Senate building and listened to the proceedings over the radio.
Each group cheered as votes favorable to their side were announced.
   Afterward, Mesa resident Millie Pratt said, ``I feel betrayed by
our Legislature. I had more faith in them.''
   Barry Gabriel, who carried a sign saying, ``Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty,'' said he was ``happy and relieved'' because ``I think he's
a menace.''
   The Senate convicted Mecham of ordering Department of Public
Safety Director Ralph Milstead not to cooperate with Corbin's
investigation of an alleged death threat by a Mecham confidant
against former Mecham aide Donna Carlson. At the time, Ms. Carlson
was about to testify before a state grand jury about the $350,000
loan.
   Mecham maintained he did not intend to obstruct justice,
although he admitted telling Milstead, ``The attorney general is
out to hang me and I'm not going to help him in any way.'' The
governor also insisted he was not informed of the alleged threat's
seriousness.
   He was convicted of misusing the $80,000 in protocol money by
loaning it to his suburban Glendale auto dealership. The
prosecution contended the fund was public money and that the
dealership desperately needed the funds to make a payroll.
   Mecham testified that he was told he could use the protocol fund
for almost anything he wanted. His son, Dennis, the dealership's
general manager, testified the dealership was in strong financial
shape at the time of the loan. A day after his testimony, he
announced it was being sold to avert financial ruin.

<HEAD>Brennan Refuses to Free NJ Lawyer From Defending Alleged Mobster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice on Tuesday refused to
free a prominent New Jersey lawyer and his firm from having to
defend an alleged mobster whose previous attorney became seriously
ill.
   Justice William J. Brennan rejected an emergency request by
Matthew P. Boylan and his firm to suspend a court order holding
them in contempt for refusing to defend an alleged organized crime
boss.
   U.S. District Judge Judge Harold Ackerman in Newark held Boylan
in contempt on Feb. 29 after the original defense lawyer became
terminally ill with cancer and had to leave the case. Ackerman is
presiding over the trial.
   Boylan is a former director of the New Jersey Division of
Criminal Justice and a former assistant U.S. attorney for New
Jersey.
   Ackerman also issued a contempt citation against Boylan's law
firm, Lowenstein, Sandler, Kohl, Fisher & Boylan of Roseland, N.J.,
for its refusal to assist Boylan. He fined Boylan $2,500 a day
until he accepted the assignment and the firm $10,000 a day.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the contempt
citations on March 9.
   Boylan balked at representing Anthony Accetturo, allegedly the
leader of the Lucchese organized-crime family in New Jersey.
   Ackerman said he selected Boylan because of his pretrial work
for the defendant.
   Milton M. Ferrel Sr. had been Accetturo's lawyer until cancer
forced him to leave the case.
   Boylan said representing Accetturo would mean he would have to
neglect obligations to five other clients.
   He and his firm noted that the trial of Accetturo and 20 others
on extortion, gambling and narcotics charges began in November
1986, has produced more than 27,000 pages of transcripts and is
likely to continue for another six months.
   The 3rd Circuit court gave Boylan 24 days to prepare his defense
of Accetturo.
   The case is U.S. vs. Accetturo, A-735.

   Contra leaders said Tuesday they would not continue
peace talks with the Sandinistas unless their delegation is allowed
to travel and speak freely inside Nicaragua during next week's
negotiations.
   The Sandinistas had told the Contra leaders they must remain
confined to an airport hotel, said rebel director Adolfo Calero,
named Tuesday as chief negotiator.
   ``It is a virtual imprisonment,'' Calero said at Contra
headquarters here. ``It is not in keeping with the idea of
reconciliation, with the idea of democratization.''
   The Contras said they will not go to Managua for the next round
of talks unless they are permitted to travel freely around
Nicaragua and speak with opposition groups.
   The Contras, who expect to arrive in Nicaragua April 12 with a
60-member delegation, plan meetings with domestic opposition
leaders, Roman Catholic bishops, anti-draft groups, business
leaders and reporters.
   They will also demand the right to place ads in both government
and opposition newspapers announcing their agenda and meetings.
   ``We are demanding that we be free when we are in Nicaragua,''
said Calero. He said the Contras were awaiting a reply to their
counterproposal, which was sent Tuesday morning to the Sandinista
foreign ministry.
   Director Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said he had been informed that
La Prensa, the principal opposition newspaper, had run out of
newsprint Tuesday, and insisted the Sandinistas supply it under
terms of the agreement negotiated last month in Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   The Contras sidestepped the possibility of a public rally inside
Nicaragua during their stay, saying that would be decided by local
opposition parties.
   The rebels expect to meet six times with the Sandinistas before
leaving April 15, and will concentrate on steps toward
democratizing the country, said Calero.
   ``It will become the Sandinistas' acid test,'' said Calero. ``It
will be very difficult for the Sandinistas to keep the agreement
and hold on to power.''
   The Contras dismissed several ``very minor'' truce violations by
both sides in recent days.
   ``Overall the cease-fire is holding,'' said Chamorro. He said
despite initial resistance to the pact by rebel field commanders,
they have come to accept the truce arrangement.
   Chamorro denied suggestions, made in testimony before a
congressional committee, that there were links between the Contras
and Panama's strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``We have no links with Gen. Noriega _ absolutely,'' said
Chamorro. He said reports Contras had been trained in that country
were ``absolutely false,'' and said it was the Sandinistas, not the
rebels, who received aid through Panama.

   Two young men who noticed
their dog digging in a brush-covered field helped recover an
estimated $10 million to $12 million in counterfeit cash that
Canadian and U.S. police had been seeking since 1976.
   The men, whose names were withheld, dug up two garbage bags
stuffed with about $4 million in bogus U.S. federal reserve
banknotes before calling police.
   Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers, digging Monday, found an
additional $8 million in uncut sheets of counterfeit $100, $50 and
$20 U.S. bills described as ``really good quality.''
   Cpl. Barry Danton of the Vancouver RCMP commercial crime squad
said an investigation had produced suspects but no arrests. He said
U.S. Treasury Department agents and the RCMP had been looking for
the money since 1976 when ``quite a bit'' of the same batch was
seized.
   ``We knew it was buried but we thought it was somewhere else,''
he said. ``We knew it was around.''
   ``We estimate it at about $10 million to $12 million,'' said
Danton. ``We haven't had time to count it yet. We're just going by
thickness. It filled the trunk of a car pretty good.''

dismissed.
   The communique gave no reason for the changes, and it did not
say if the secretaries would be moved to others jobs.
   The country's leader, Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings, has been
cracking down on official corruption. Authorities fired 33 police
officers a week ago and 19 others two weeks earlier, accusing them
of drug trafficking, armed robbery, and accepting bribes.
   In other changes announced Tuesday, several secretaries in the
cabinet, known as the Provisional National Defense Council, were
moved to other posts.

<HEAD>Rep. Kennedy Exchanges Angry Words With British Army Patrol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass.,
exchanged angry words with a British soldier Tuesday when his car
was stopped at an army checkpoint in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
   Kennedy, son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, was being driven
from a two-hour tour of Divis Flats, a run-down housing complex in
Roman Catholic west Belfast, when troops at the checkpoint said
they wanted to search the car.
   The 35-year-old Kennedy was accompanied by a local priest, the
Rev. Matt Wallace, who was ordered to open the trunk.
   ``You cannot do this to a priest!'' Kennedy said to one of the
soldiers in an exchange witnessed by reporters. The soldier then
grabbed Kennedy by the arm and the congressman shouted, ``Take your
hands off me.''
   The soldier, releasing his grip, then asked Kennedy, ``Why don't
you get back to your own country?'' Kennedy snapped back, ``Why
don't you get back to yours?''
   Kennedy is to meet politicians and church leaders during his
three-day visit to the province, which has been torn by political
and sectarian violence between the Protestant majority and the
Catholic minority since 1969.
   Kennedy is due to travel to the Irish Republic on Friday for
talks with Prime Minister Charles Haughey and to visit his family's
ancestral home in Wexford over the weekend.

<HEAD>U.S. Pilot, West German Killed in Helicopter Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUTTGART, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Army helicopter crashed
Tuesday after hitting trees on a routine mission in a heavy fog,
killing the American pilot and a West German U.S. Army employee,
authorities said.
   There were no other casualties in the 9 a.m. crash of the OH-58A
Kiowa helicopter near Nabern, 25 miles southeast of Stuttgart,
according to a statement from the Stuttgart-based U.S. Army 7th
Corps.
   The statement identified the dead pilot as 1st Lt. Glen P.
Adams, 28, who was assigned to Headquarters Company, 4th Battalion,
159th Aviation, 11th Aviation Brigade, in Schwaebisch Hall, near
Stuttgart. The Army could not provide his hometown.
   Also killed was a West German employee of the U.S. Army, who was
a passenger on the aircraft, the statement said. His name was being
withheld until relatives had been notified, the Army said.
   Stuttgart police said the helicopter went down in an open area
after running into tree branches in fog.
   A board of officers from the U.S. Army Safety Center in Fort
Rucker, Ala., planned to arrive Wednesday to investigate the crash,
the Army said.
   It was the third crash of a NATO military aircraft in less than
a week.
   A French Mirage jet fighter crashed on March 30 one mile from a
nuclear power plant in the southern state of Bavaria, killing the
pilot.
   A day later, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed into the
southern town of Forst, near another nuclear power plant,
demolishing three houses and killing a resident and the pilot.
   The crashes increased criticism of NATO pilot-training practices.
   Tens of thousands of West German protesters in traditional
Easter peace marches not only called for scrapping nuclear arms,
but also protested the two crashes.
   The Association for General Aviation, a West German organization
of private pilots, joined the protesters in demanding that NATO
keep its warplanes away from nuclear power plants.
   On Sunday, the mass-circulation Bild am Sonntag newspaper
printed a article headlined ``This Junk Flies Over Our Heads,''
accompanied by what it said was pictures of a patched-up U.S. Air
Force F-16.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified U.S. employee at Sembach
Air Base southwest of Frankfurt as saying poor maintenance and a
shortage of spare parts made U.S. F-16 planes unsafe.
   The report said 110,000 low-level military practice flights were
conducted over West Germany annually by seven NATO-member air
forces, including the United States.
   On Tuesday, U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Pascoe said he was
``greatly concerned and disturbed'' by the report. ``The United
States Air Force does not fly junk,'' he said at a news conference
at Sembach.
   Pascoe said the aircraft pictured on the front page of Bild am
Sonntag was the shell of a F-4 that had been out of service since
July 1986. He said the aircraft does not fly and was only used for
battle damage repair training.
   He said the man quoted in the newspaper did not work at Sembach
Air Base. He said a man with the same last name worked for a few
weeks as a gate guard at the base about five years ago.

   Where does a Bengal tiger sleep?
   Anywhere it wants to. Heh heh heh.
   But that's no joke for Ramelle Rockhold and her husband, who
ceded their king-size bed to a 100-pound, 7-month-old tiger named
Reena.
   ``I haven't had the heart to make her sleep outside yet,''
Rockhold said.
   Reena also eats on the bed. She won't eat anywhere else, and
turns up her nose even at her favorite _ raw chicken _ unless she's
hand-fed.
   ``She's a little spoiled,'' acknowledges Rockhold, who was given
the big cat four months ago by a friend in Texas.
   It was Reena's kittenish, nocturnal playfulness rather than a
territorial demand that pushed her owners out of their bed,
Rockhold said.
   ``The only reason we moved into the guest bedroom is because if
we got up at 2 in the morning to get a drink of water, we'd wake
her up. And then, like a puppy, she'd be ready to play. And she'd
crawl under the covers and play with our feet,'' said Rockhold.
   Rockhold said she and her husband have to lock the bedroom door
because Reena can turn doorknobs.
   The cat also loves the Rockhold hot tub and made a playpen out
of the bathtub. The Rockholds had to take the handles off the tub
because Reena learned how to turn the water on herself.
   Rockhold, who lives in the country north of Zachary, said it's
legal to own a tiger, but she doesn't expect to keep it.
   Reena is destined for a home at Louisiana State University,
which has a 14-year-old Bengal tiger named Mike IV as its mascot.
Reena will be going to school at age 3, and Chancellor James
Wharton said she might be used to breed Mike V.
   Rockhold is in no hurry to lose a pet or regain a bedroom.
``I'll just cry my eyes out when that kittycat is gone, just like
any mother would,'' she said.

   The sheriff's department in Rankin County
is leaving no garbage unturned in its efforts to hunt down rural
litterbugs.
   Two people were threatened with arrest for littering last week
after deputies sifted through bags of garbage tossed by the
roadside and found letters and addresses, Sheriff J.B. Torrence
said.
   ``They dumped two bags each, and I gave them (the suspects) four
big garbage bags and told them to go up there and fill them up,''
he said Tuesday.
   The sheriff made them bring the bags back to his office for
verification.
   In return for the labor, Torrence said, he didn't press charges.
The littering charge is a misdemeanor punishable by public service
work or a fine up to $500.

   The Easter bunny left a nice little
nest egg in 9-year-old Brian Saady's basket _ a state lottery
ticket worth $5,000.
   When Brian explored the goodies in his Easter basket Sunday, he
had the usual priorities of a young boy, opening first the candy
bar, then the baseball cards, and finally the lottery ticket.
   ``His mother and I started screaming,'' said Tony Saady, sales
manager at a furniture store. ``We called all our relatives.''
   After a few minutes of excitement, Brian returned to other
holiday gifts, including a miniature pool table.
   ``I kind of forgot about it,'' the boy said.
   Brian has drawn up a list of computer games he wants to buy with
his winnings, but the bulk of the money will be used for his
college education, Saady said.
   Brian is apparently one of the youngest of the 4,000 to 5,000
people to win $5,000 since the lottery game began Jan. 12, state
lottery spokesman Ed George said.
   A person must be 18 years old to buy a ticket, but state law
allows anyone to receive one as a gift, George said.

   Michael Dukakis held onto a narrow lead over rival
Democrat Jesse Jackson in Colorado's precinct caucuses today with
the resumption of a slow-moving counting process that Jackson said
``heightens suspicions.''
   ``The fact is, the count should have been in now,'' Jackson said
today in Kenosha, Wis. ``The long count is unfair.''
   With 57 percent of the precincts in Colorado reporting, the
Massachusetts governor had 45 percent of the vote while Jackson had
41 percent. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who made little
effort in the state, trailed with less than 3 percent.
   Dukakis had 3,626 county delegates to Jackson's 3,276, according
to figures supplied by the Colorado Democratic Party.
   Calculations based on the incomplete returns indicated Dukakis
would win 21 national convention delegates if he maintained his
lead in later returns and the results held up at the congressional
district and state conventions in the next few weeks. Jackson would
win 17 delegates and another seven would be uncommitted.
   Vice President George Bush dominated straw polls taken at
Republican caucuses, cornering nearly 80 percent of the vote and
staving off a feared ambush by Pat Robertson.
   Dukakis and Jackson had hoped to use the caucuses _ which are
the first step in selecting 45 Colorado Democratic delegates _ to
gain stature for today's Wisconsin primary.
   But with the results trickling in and the candidates within a
few percentage points of one another, it appeared neither would be
able to claim a big victory.
   State Democratic chairman Buie Seawell, a Colorado super
delegate and Dukakis supporter, said he believed the Massachusetts
governor would be the winner. However, he said, ``Jackson has done
one hell of a job in a state that is not Jackson country.''
   In return, Jackson criticized the slow counting process,
supervised by Seawell.
   ``The state chairman endorsed Mr. Dukakis,'' Jackson said. ``You
cannot very well be a fair referee and coaching another player.''
   ``This long and slow count represents a certain ineptness ... it
heightens suspicions,'' he said.
   Seawell responded today that Jackson ``is just wrong'' and said
he took ``personal offense'' at the candidate's remarks. He said
his staff reported every precinct where results were available
Monday night.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, it was run fairly and well,''
Dukakis said today of the Colorado contest.
   As expected, Bush, who stands almost alone in his quest for the
nomination, dominated the scant returns reported to Republican
Party officials. Bush's chief rival, Bob Dole, dropped out last
week.
   Early Republican straw poll results showed Bush with 1,288 straw
votes or 78 percent and Robertson with 136, or 8 percent, at 201
GOP precinct caucuses.
   Dukakis had picked up endorsements several weeks ago from Gov.
Roy Romer and Seawell, but Jackson made his presence felt with a
series of strong campaign appearances over the Easter weekend.
   While no delegates to the Democratic or Republican national
conventions were chosen Monday, the caucuses began a complicated
delegate selection process that will culminate at the state
conventions in May and June.
   Colorado will send 51 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, six of them super delegates, including Romer and
Seawell. Thirty-six Colorado Republicans will attend their party's
national convention.
   The state Democratic Party had planned to provide results by
12:30 a.m. today from Colorado's 13 most populous counties, which
account for 80 percent of the state's 2,784 precincts. But the
party was able to report less than 20 percent of the state's
precincts by its self-imposed deadline.
   Some caucuses delayed their start in order to allow sports fans
to watch the end of the Kansas-Oklahoma NCAA basketball
championship. One precinct took a recess so participants could
watch the game.
   Dukakis' campaigners were pleased with the initial caucus
results.
   ``We had hoped to hold our own in Denver and we are doing better
than we expected,'' said David Villarino, Dukakis' state director.
   ``We are doing well among the Hispanics. Jackson had hoped to
seal the Hispanic vote but we have done well there,'' he said.
   Mike Veit, Gore's campaign director, said his campaign had spent
only $17,000 in Colorado. ``I think people in Colorado still have a
sort of a Gary Hart hangover,'' he said, refering to the state's
former senator who twice entered and dropped out of the race and
noting the large number of uncommitted delegates.
   ``They've been on sort of a roller-coaster.''

<HEAD>Jury Selection Continues In Zaccaro Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANICA KIRKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Potential jurors questioned Tuesday in the
cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr. said their judgment would not be
influenced by the fact that the defendant's mother is former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while she was a candidate in 1984,
and she thought the attacks had carried over to Zaccaro after his
arrest.
   The questioning was watched by six reporters one day after Judge
Francis McCaffrey imposed and then lifted a gag order.
   Most of the jurors questioned said they had read newspaper
accounts of the case since Zaccaro was charged in 1986 with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent. Zaccaro,
24, was then a senior at Middlebury College.
   The offense carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and
a $10,000 fine.
   ``I can't say I don't feel the press picked on these people,''
said Joanne Cillo said when asked if she was pleased with how
Ferraro has been treated.
   But she said her views would not interfere with her judgment if
she is chosen to hear the case.
   ``The press is not trying this case,'' she said. ``The issue is,
did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   Ferraro, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers taking
notes intently. But she stopped when Cillo spoke about the
treatment her family received, rested her head in her hands and
looked down.
   John Zaccaro Sr. accompanied his wife and son on the second day
of questioning.
   None of the other jurors questioned so far have said they would
be influenced by the fact Ferraro is Zaccaro's mother. ``It
wouldn't matter one way or another who she was,'' Ellen Daly of
Rutland said.
   At the noon break, Ferraro declined to comment, telling one
reporter, ``It's nothing against you personally. We're just not
answering anything for anybody.''
   McCaffery had imposed the gag order Monday in response to
complaints by defense attorneys that the presence of too many
reporters could intimidate potential jurors. News organizations
protested, and it was rescinded later that day when all sides
agreed to permit a pool of six reporters.
   Prosecutor John Quinn said he was not sure how long it would
take to pick a jury.
   Pre-trial publicity seemed less of a problem than the jurors'
opinions about drug use.
   One man who was dismissed said, ``I'd probably be the one going
to jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid.''
   The trial comes more than two years after Zaccaro was arrested
outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   The charge involves allegations that Zaccaro sold cocaine to
undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to his off-campus
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his mother, but the Vermont Supreme Court refused to
dismiss the case.

<HEAD>Airline On-Time Record Improved in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. airlines improved their on-time record in
February, but one of every four flights continued to be late as
weather conditions played a major role in how close a carrier was
able to stay to schedule.
   The Transportation Department said Tuesday that 74.7 percent of
the flights reported by 14 major airlines in February arrived
within 15 minutes of schedule, an increase from the 69.2 percent
the previous month.
   The airlines with the best record, however, also were those that
concentrated flights in the Southwest and West, where weather
conditions were generally good during the month.
   According to the department, nine of every 10 Pacific Southwest
Airlines arrived within 15 minutes of schedule, the government's
margin for a flight to be considered on-time. America West and
Southwest Airlines followed with arrival rates of better than 88
percent.
   Northwest Airlines, which operates largely in the northern tier
of states, had the worst on-time record among the 14 airlines, with
61.7 percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule.
   Northwest officials attributed the large number of delays to
poor weather and said the airline's figures improved to 75.4
percent in March when weather improved. Those figures will be
released officially by the government next month.
   ``We encountered unusually severe weather in much of our system
during the first 21 days of February,'' said William Wren, vice
president for corporate relations at Northwest.
   Other airlines with a less than 70 percent on-time record were
Continental Airlines, with 67.7 percent, and Trans World Airlines,
with 69.4 percent. American Airlines had the best performance among
the large carriers, with 80.8 percent of its flight arriving on
time.
   The report excludes delays caused by mechanical problems, but
includes those attributed to poor weather.
   The number of reports on mishandled bags filed with airlines
declined during February, averaging 8.75 reports for every 1,000
passengers flown compared with 11.83 percent in January.
   Meanwhile, complaints to the Transportation Department's
consumer affairs office about air travel increased slightly during
March to 2,584 from 2,235 in February.
   The department releases the on-time arrival statistics for
February at the same time as the consumer complaint statistics,
although the complaint information covers a different month.
   Continental, Eastern Airlines and Northwest had the highest
complaint rate in both March and during the first three months of
1988. There were 18 complaints for every 100,000 passengers at
Continental during March, 16.14 complaints at Eastern and 12.37
complaints at Northwest, according to the department.
   The Orlando, Fla., airport had the worst arrival record in
February with only 62.7 percent of the flight arriving on time,
followed by Detroit at 64 percent.
   The best arrival record was recorded at Phoenix, Ariz. and Las
Vegas, Nev. Both airports had on-time arrival rates of nearly 83
percent. Charlotte, N.C., recorded an 80.7 on-time percentage.

<TEXT>
   While nearly 50 percent of
reported rape victims are adolescents, many pediatricians are
ill-equipped to treat them, the American Academy of Pediatrics says
in urging better training to handle sexual assault victims.
   In a policy statement published in the April issue of its
monthly journal, Pediatrics, the academy notes that pediatricians
frequently serve in emergency rooms as the primary health-care
provider in adolescent rapes.
   Pediatricians ``need to be sensitive to the acute emotional
problems, not to do things that might cause further psychological
trauma,'' Dr. S. Kenneth Schonberg, chairman of the Academy's
Committee on Adolescence, said Tuesday.
   Doctors should avoid ``accusatory questioning, (or) forcing
testing on somebody who really doesn't want to be tested; that
becomes another assault,'' he said.
   ``One has to find a sensitive balance between the need to
accumulate evidence and the need to protect the young person from
yet another assault,'' he said. Immediately after the assault
``might not be the best time to do an internal examination,'' he
said.
   ``It still does occur, that young people ... are dealt with
insensitively and their medical contact therefore is not helpful to
them,'' said Schonberg, director of the division of adolescent
medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.
   Citing U.S. Justice Department figures, Schonberg said nearly 50
percent of rape victims are young people under the age of 21.
   ``We would urge that every pediatric training program'' include
instruction in how to deal with the emotional and physical problems
associated with rape, he said.
   ``Most pediatricians have had little prior experience or
training in managing such problems,'' members of the committee
wrote in the journal. ``Residency and continued medical education
programs should assist the pediatrician in developing the necessary
skills and techniques for treating these patients in a sensitive
and supportive manner.''
   The article included a sample sexual assault data sheet that is
widely available to pediatricians, with guidelines on what an exam
of a rape victim should include.
   It urged discretion in the use of pregnancy prevention drugs,
noting that they can produce nausea, vomiting and other side
effects that could add to the victim's trauma.
   ``The incidence of pregnancy after rape is extremely low ... so
the wisdom of using these drugs is questionable,'' the authors
wrote. ``The practioner who chooses to use those drugs should be
fully informed about these factors and should share these facts
with patients.''
   Tom Birch, legislative counsel for the National Child Abuse
Coalition in Washington, D.C., said he advocates better training
for physicians and others who deal with victimized youths.
   ``I think generally there's a feeling that professionals _
whether they're physicians, or attorneys or teachers _ whose jobs
bring them into contact with children, are not prepared to deal
with the kinds of situations that children find themselves in,
where are they are victimized,'' he said by telephone Tuesday from
Washington.
   ``Unfortunately, these professionals are the ones in our
communities who have the contact with the children that should
require them to be the best prepared,'' he said.
   ``I think that it may be a factor of our educational system,
that has not recognized the extent to which children are victims of
abuse or exploitation,'' Birch said, ``because certainly it's only
been in the last 15 to 20 years that social services and medical
professionals have even been able to identify the numbers of
children who are victims.''

   The King of England and even Sophia Loren
weren't enough to lure viewers to their sets over the holiday
weekend, according to last week's Nielsen ratings.
   The week ending April 3 was NBC's fifth weekly win in a row and
its 24th win in the 30-week season, which ends in two weeks. NBC
had an average rating of 14.6. ABC had 12.8 and CBS 12.6. The
season-to-date averages are: NBC 16.2, ABC 13.8, CBS 13.5.
   All three networks lost viewers on Easter Sunday. The
three-network share, or percentage of the viewing audience, is an
average 71 for the season. On Sunday it was 67, and 69 for the week.
   CBS won the night with ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote''
leading into ``The Woman He Loved,'' the story of King Edward
VIII's abdication to marry Wallis Warfield Simpson, an American
divorcee. The movie, starring Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews, had
a rating of 14.5 and a 25 share and ranked 27th.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   NBC launched the two-part ``The Fortunate Pilgrim,'' starring
Sophia Loren as matriarch of an immigrant family, but got only a
13.1 and 22 share to rank 40th out of 73.
   NBC began the evening badly with a repeat of an Andy Williams
special that got a measly 4.2 rating and 9 share and was the
lowest-rated prime-time network show of the week. That, NBC said,
provided a poor lead-in for a repeat ``Family Ties,'' which landed
in the bottom 10, perhaps the worst performances ever for the
formerly top-10 show.
   The highest-rated made-for-TV movie was last Monday's ``Addicted
to His Love'' on ABC, which was 10th. On Sunday, ABC came in for
the night with the theatrical film ``Superman II.''
   The top-rated shows of the week were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC,
with a 25.1 rating and a 42 share, ``A Different World'' NBC,
``Cheers'' NBC, ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC,
``ALF'' NBC, ``The Wonder Years'' ABC, ``Matlock'' NBC, ``Growing
Pains'' ABC and ``Addicted to His Love'' ABC.
   NBC won in prime-time but continued in third place in news. The
``CBS Evening News'' was still No. 1 with a rating of 10.5 and a 21
share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 10.3 and 20. ``NBC
Nightly News'' had 9.0 and 18.
   NBC analysts say they are still baffled by the fall of their
newscast to third place, despite research they say shows Tom Brokaw
as the most popular of the three network anchors.
   In prime time, though, NBC was cheered by ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' a series based on the movie of the same name, which ranked
11th and equaled the 28 share of its premiere. Also, ``Miami Vice''
won its time period for the second time this season when it was
moved to 10 p.m. EST last Friday.
   Saturday NCAA basketball playoffs on CBS ranked 38th, but
apparently gave a boost to ``West 57th,'' which had a 20 share and
wasn't among the bottom 10 for a change. NBC won the night with
repeats.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Family Ties,''
``Frank's Place,'' ``Ohara,'' ``Dolly!'' ``My Sister Sam,''
``Hotel,'' ``Buck James,'' ``More Than a Game,'' ``Trial and
Error'' and ``Andy Williams and the NBC Kids.''

   Americans abroad were arrested at a rate of
eight per day last year, more than 40 percent of them on narcotics
charges, the State Department said Tuesday.
   In an annual report designed to frighten tourists thinking of
taking drugs on vacation, the department said: ``As we approach the
busy travel season, many Americans are getting ready for that long
awaited trip abroad. For some, the trip will become a nightmare.''
   ``Those Americans who assume there is no real danger in buying
or carrying just a `small' amount of drugs on their overseas trip
may be in for a very unpleasant surprise,'' the report said.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the seriousness
of the problem was underscoreourt's conviction and
six-year jail sentence Tuesday of Conan Owen, a 23-year-od by a Spanish
cld
Virginia photographer who said he unwittingly brought cocaine into
Spain in an acquaintance's suitcase.
   The Justice Department has said it believes in Owen's innocence
and the report said ``travelers should be particularly wary of
persons who ask them to carry a package or drive a car across a
border. They might unknowingly become narcotics traffickers.''
   Last year, 3,041 Americans were arrested abroad, 41 percent of
them on drug-related charges. It was a 10eral
penitentiaries in Oakdale, La. and Atlanta, Ga., the report said.
   The largest number of inmate mistreatment complaints from
Americans abroad came from the inmates of the San Luis Rio Colorado
prison in northern Mexico.
   About one-fourth of the 164 Americans arrested in the area
covered by the consulate in Hermosillo, Mexico, complained of
mistreatment and ``U.S. officials found such reports credible and
made a vigorous formal protest in August,'' the report said.
   Since then, no reports of mistreatment at that prison have been
received, the report said.
   The number of American incarcerated in Saudi Arabia declined,
mostly because that country has become more lenient toward
foreigners accused of breaking such Islamic laws as possession of
alcoholic beverages.
   People found guilty of having liquor are generally deported a
few days after arrest, rather than sentenced to jail terms, the
report said.
   In honor of the 60th birthday of the King of Thailand, several
American were freed from prison last year and a few others had
their sentences reduced. Still, 30 Americans remained in Thai
prisons at the end of the year.
   The United States spent more than $46,000 for medical assistance
and food for U.S. prisoners. About $20,000 of this was spent in
Thailand ``where prison conditions are substandard,'' the report
said.

   More than 200 members of
the 7th Infantry Division left for Panama on Tuesday to bolster
protection for U.S. citizens and other interests.
   The unit from Fort Ord arrived at this sprawling Air Force base
45 miles northeast of San Francisco late Monday, and lumbering C-5A
transports began lifting off about 11:30 a.m. today.
   Heading south with them are 26 aircraft of the Army's most
effective helicopter inventory: 15 UH-60 Blackhawk utility
helicopters; seven rocket-and-missile-ready Cobra attack gunships,
and four OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopters.
   ``I'm looking forward to going. This is what we've trained for.
We're just going to do out job,'' said maintenance commander Capt.
Louise Morgan, 31, of Bovey, Minn., shortly before the units began
leaving.
   She said the only grumbling she'd heard was from troops who had
to stay behind at Fort Ord.
   ``The other troops are excited. I don't think anyone is worried
... It's always in the back of your mind that you're going,'' she
said.
   Another maintenance worker, 1st Sgt. Ed Luna, agreed the unit
was prepared for anything. ``If we get caught in the middle (of
combat) we'll just have to do what we have to do ... we're ready,''
said Luna, 45, of Honolulu.
   The United States has been using economic sanctions in an effort
to oust Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has been
indicted for drug trafficking. Some U.S. citizens in Panama have
reported being harassed during a six-week financial crisis there.
   The deployment comes only days after fellow soldiers returned
from emergency deployment to Honduras, where the administration
said Nicaraguan Sandinistas had established a threat after crossing
the border.
   The Fort Ord troopers are joining some 1,100 other soldiers and
Marines heading for Panama. No word was given on how long the new
troops can be expected to remain in Panama.

   The lack of political progress toward
substantially cutting the budget deficit and reforming federal
market regulation threatens to cause another stock crash, the
chairman of the American Stock Exchange said Tuesday.
   ``The conditions that created the atmosphere in which a market
meltdown nearly occurred are still present _ creating a kind of
economic time bomb that threatens the whole system,'' Arthur Levitt
Jr. told a National Press Club luncheon.
   Levitt said the budget deficit ``has not been satisfactorily
addressed,'' and he complained that ``regulatory solutions ... have
been debated but not enacted.''
   However, he declined to single out either Congress or the Reagan
administration for blame. Both are about equally responsible for
failure to reduce the budget deficit, he said.
   On regulatory reform, Levitt said Congress is hampered by
committees ``jockeying for jurisdictional control.'' And, he said,
although the administration has spent the past seven years trying
to reduce regulation, it must now recognize ``the protection of the
public must be the foremost consideration.''
   ``If the Congress and the administration continue to be
paralyzed in a political deadlock ... I have great concerns about
the future of the markets as we know them,'' he said.
   Levitt called for the creation of a special study commission
that, without delaying congressional and administration efforts at
finding short-term solutions, would focus on reform for the next
decade.
   Levitt, who heads the third-largest stock trading system in the
nation, ranking behind the New York Stock Exchange and the
over-the-counter market, also said the securities industry must
move to reform itself before individual investors return to the
market in force.
   He said the current system for recruiting, training and paying
brokers has made the public suspicious of brokers. He said
brokerage firms should stop raiding each others' staffs, a practice
he called ``demeaning piracy,'' and instead spend more to train
brokers.
   The current commission system of compensation encourages brokers
to make as many trades as they can and ``raises customers' fears
that their brokers are doing business when the best strategy might
be to sit tight,'' Levitt said.
   He suggested commissions based on an across-the-board percentage
of assets managed rather than on the number of transactions.

<HEAD>Investment Profits Boosted Taxes of Richest 1 Percent in 1986</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The richest 1 percent of Americans paid more
than one-fourth of all individual income taxes in 1986, due in
large part to an extraordinary increase in investment income, the
Treasury Department said Tuesday.
   The portion of taxes paid by those with incomes of less than
$50,000 a year dropped from 66.8 percent in 1981, before enactment
of across-the-board tax cuts, to 45.7 percent in 1986, the
department said. During the same period, the share borne by those
making over $100,000 more than doubled, from 15.2 percent of the
total to 30.6 percent.
   Those whose incomes placed them among the wealthiest 1 percent
saw their share of the tax burden rise from 18.1 percent in 1981 to
26.1 percent five years later.
   The Treasury analysis is based on Internal Revenue Service
sampling of returns filed last year, which reflected 1986 earnings.
   Treasury said the increasing share of taxes paid by the very
rich is part of a continuing trend that began with enactment of the
1981 tax cut, which slashed the maximum tax rate on the wealthy
from 70 percent to 50 percent. It since has been cut to 33 percent.
   ``The 1986 increase also reflects the extraordinary level of
capital gains realized in 1986 in anticipation of the 1987 rate
increase on capital gains,'' the analysis said. While capital gains
represented only 11 percent of the income of the richest Americans
in 1981, the share rose to 15 percent in 1985 and nearly 25 percent
in 1986.
   Capital gains are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate
and other investments. The top tax rate on these profits was 20
percent in 1986. Knowing that rate would climb to 28 percent in
1987, upper-income taxpayers unloaded billions of dollars worth of
assets in the closing days of 1986.
   Capital gains represented less than 2 percent of income for
other Americans in each of the three years, Treasury said.
   About 12 of every 1,000 couples and individuals have adjusted
gross incomes over $100,000 a year. The analysis found those
taxpayers paid $43 billion in taxes in 1981, $77 billion in 1985
and $115 billion in 1986.
   Part of that increase is attributable to the fact that the
number of people with incomes at that level has increased
significantly in recent years. Treasury provided no estimate of how
many people earned over $100,000 in 1986, but IRS figures show the
number in 1985 _ more than 1.2 million _ was 63 percent higher than
in 1982. The number earning over $1 million a year more than
doubled to 17,312 in 1985 from 1981.
   Between 1981 and 1986, taxes paid by those with incomes between
$50,000 and $100,000 increased from $51 billion to $89 billion. The
burden on those under $50,000 dropped from $190 billion to $172
billion.
   About half of Americans have incomes under $35,000 a year,
including those who are too poor to pay taxes. They paid 7.5
percent of the individual income tax in 1981 and 6.4 percent in
1986.

<HEAD>Vietnam Asks Aid in Return for MIA Accounting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Vietnames official said Tuesday
the United States should help rebuild this country if it wants a
full accounting of 1,700 Americans still listed as missing 13 years
after the war's end.
   Nguyen Dy Nien, a deputy foreign minister, made the comment the
day before Vietnam was to turn over what it says are the remains of
27 missing Americans, its largest delivery so far.
   He repeated charges that Washington, by merely encouraging
private aid to Vietnam, has not done its part under an agreement
reached in August between U.S. envoy John W. Vessey and Vietnam's
foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach.
   The agreement calls for Vietnam to end a long deadlock on
accounting for Americans missing in the war, which ended in April
1975, and the United States to address Vietnam's own humanitarian
concerns.
   Washington has sent investigative medical teams to Vietnam and
encouraged private aid, but has not lifted an embargo on official
aid imposed to protest Vietnam's decade-long occupation of
neighboring Cambodia.
   ``We don't care what the (private groups) are doing ... We think
the government should participate,'' Nien said. ``It must show its
concern, its direct commitment.''
   He spoke to Sen. Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican who
arrived Tuesday to discuss issues including the fates of 1,767
Americans still officially missing in action. Pressler is a member
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Nien said the U.S. government has done nothing since the war
ended to help Vietnam recover from American bombing that destroyed
thousands of schools, and has not aided Vietnam's disabled veterans
or the half-million orphans created by the conflict.
   He said it was ``unfortunate that (the agreement) was not fully
implemented and it sometimes was wrongly interpreted. Both sides
recognized the humanitarian issues of each other and both must be
resolved.''
   Wednesday's delivery is the fourth since the Vessey agreement.
   If U.S. Army laboratories identify the 27 sets of remains, it
would mean substantial progress because Vietnam has repatriated
only 152 confirmed remains. The largest previous transfer _ Aug.
14, 1985 _ involved 26 remains, and at least 24 were confirmed.
   Pressler told Nien his constituents often say they believe Hanoi
returns the remains gradually and still holds some living American
prisoners. Nien called the charges ``unthinkable.''
   Nguyen Can, head of the special Vietnamese office on resolving
the MIA issue, denied charges that the skeletal remains of U.S. Air
Force pilot Edwin B. Tucker were kept for years at a medical school
or hospital before being returned to the United States on Nov. 25.
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported that Tucker's
remains were used as a teaching tool. He was shot down over the
northern city of Hon Gai in April 1967.
   Can, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's North American
affairs department, told The Associated Press the charge has
``aroused indignation on the part of our people and proves there is
no good will on the part of the United States.''

<HEAD>Powell Won't Rule Out Sending More Troops to Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's national
security adviser said Tuesday he would not rule out the possibility
of sending more American troops to Panama as the United States
considers new steps to force the ouster of military strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``We have no immediate plans (to send more forces) but I would
not eliminate that possibility,'' Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell said.
   At the same time, a senior administration official said the
15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces which Noriega heads should
remove him or ask him to step aside. ``I think it would be a good
thing for them to do,'' said the official, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   As the military chief, Noriega is the power behind the
Panamanian government. The United States has been seeking his
removal since he was indicted earlier this year in Florida on drug
trafficking charges.
   Meanwhile, some 1,300 American troops began arriving at U.S.
military installations in Panama to augment the 10,000 troops
stationed at the U.S. Southern Command there.
   The Pentagon says the deployment is only to protect U.S. lives
and interests in Panama.
   ``With the additional forces being brought in today, I think
there is a reasonable degree of security of American installations,
and I see no increased, immedate threat to the American citizens
living in Panama,'' Powell said.
   Reagan, vacationing at his mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara,
was briefed on developments in Panama in a telephone conversation
with Powell. Later, the national security adviser answered
questions from reporters at an ocean-side hotel.
   ``We continue to examine a full range of diplomatic options,
economic options, military options and political options'' to put
pressure on Noriega, Powell said.
   The national security adviser said the United States was
considering steps that would require American companies to withhold
taxes and fees from Panama. But he suggested there would be
problems implementing such actions.
   He said the sanctions imposed by the United States 3{ weeks ago
have had a telling effect on Panama but obviously have not been
enough to force out Noriega.
   ``Whether it will (be enough) over a period of time, whether we
can wait an extended period of time is what we're examining,''
Powell said.
   He repeatedly refused to say what options the United States is
considering.
   ``As you examine a situation like this, you look at all options
that might be realistic and proper to consider on the economic
side, on the military side, on the political side, and we're doing
that,'' Powell said. ``We are acting prudently and realistically.''
   Powell also said he was aware of reports that Cuban forces had
joined an international Marxist brigade to assist Noriega, but said
he had no information to substantiate such a story.
   The senior administration official, speaking after Powell's
on-the-record briefing, said there was no evidence of ``any massive
Cuban involvement.''
   Suggesting that the military force out Noriega, the official
noted there had been one coup attempt but that Noriega ``is still
firmly in control.
   ``To the extent that members of the (military) are
dissatisfied,'' the official said, ``I think it would be in their
best interests to remove General Noriega or ask him to step aside.''

<HEAD>Judge Won't Stay Order to Broaden Amnesty Standards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday refused to stay his
order that the Reagan administration broaden its standard for
determining whether certain illegal aliens qualify for amnesty
under the 1986 immigration law.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin denied the Justice
Department's motion for a stay pending appeal of his ruling that
overturned a regulation for processing amnesty requests from aliens
who had legally entered the country but overstayed tourist or
student visas.
   The regulation, which Sporkin said violated the plain language
of the immigration law, required that the illegal status of
non-immigrant aliens be known to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service as of Jan. 1, 1982 for them to qualify for amnesty.
   Sporkin said the law merely required that any federal agency
have documentation, such as a tax or Social Security form, from
which officials could conclude an alien's status was illegal as of
that date.
   Groups that counsel illegal aliens who brought the suit
estimated that as many as 50,000 non-immigrant aliens were being
denied legalization under the disputed regulations.
   More than 1 million illegal aliens have sought naturalization
under the amnesty program that expires May 4. Congress is
considering legislation to extend the deadline by six months.
   Sporkin, who had issued a preliminary injunction last week, made
the ruling permanent.

   The Reagan administration is
weighing whether to invoke a law authorizing the seizure of tax
payments made by U.S. businesses operating in Panama, national
security adviser Colin Powell said today.
   Saying that economic sanctions applied so far ``have not yet
created enough pressure'' to force the ouster of strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, Powell said ``we are examining additional
pressure that might be brought to bear.''
   He briefed reporters not long after giving the vacationing
President Reagan an update on the Panamanian problem.
   A senior administration official, disussing Panama on grounds he
not be publicly identified, said the United States would encourage
any move within the Panamanian Defense Forces to oust Noriega.
   ``He still is firmly in control, but not as in control as he
was, perhaps, a month ago, and every effort we can take to foster
that discontent in the PDF, I can assure you we are taking,'' he
said.
   ``If the PDF, after examining the situation, think it would be
useful to remove General Noriega, I think that would be a very
sound decision for them to take,'' the official said.
   Powell acknowledged that some corporations operating in Panama
have balked at having their tax payments placed in an escrow
account because of a concern that it could hamper their operations.
   For this reason, he said, White House advisers and other
administration officials are studying the implications of invoking
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act _ which would
authorize the government to seize these payments.
   ``We have to be cautious before you invoke ... because it is a
very powerful tool, and the staff back in Washington is examining
the pros and cons'' of invoking the act, Powell said.
   ``And if it is a sensible thing to do, to continue to apply
pressure on General Noriega, we will provide that for the president
for his consideration.''
   Powell refused to discuss any military options being weighed,
except he indicated there would be no immediate dispatch of troops
beyond the 1,300 deployed to the Central American country early
this week.
   Powell, an Army lieutenant general, said he believes there now
is ``a reasonable degree of security'' for Americans living in
Panama and the U.S. installations there.
   Meanwhile, the administration was taking a dim view of Jesse
Jackson's contacts with Noriega, despite Jackson's diplomatic coups
in the past during visits to Cuba and Syria.
   Following Jackson's disclosure that he had sent a letter to
Noriega two weeks ago asking him to resign, State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Monday that such communications
could prolong Noriega's grip on power.
   ``The proliferation of channels is a tactic Noriega uses to buy
time,'' Ms. Oakley said. ``We have available channels of
communication with Noriega if and when they are needed. We think it
would be best to continue to use these channels exclusively.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with Reagan in
California, also criticized the Democratic presidential candidate's
involvement in Panama. ``We have a bipartisan coordinated plan for
dealing with Noriega,'' he said. ``That's why it's important to
Congress and the public, and we believe it's been working.''
   Jackson has dealt successfully in the past with other U.S.
adversaries. In 1984, he traveled to Cuba and persuaded President
Fidel Castro to release 26 political prisoners.
   He later went to Syria and, during talks with President Hafez
Assad, won freedom for an American military pilot detained there.
His efforts earned him an enthusiastic White House welcome.
   Jackson said he has no plans to travel to Panama to try to help
resolve the 6-week-old crisis in that country.
   About 1,300 Army soldiers and Marines were headed to Panama
today, joining the 10,000 troops stationed at the U.S. Southern
Command in Panama. The Pentagon said the soldiers are being sent to
increase security for Americans and U.S. facilities in Panama.
   In a related development, a former Panamanian official told the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday that Noriega probably
has evidence of complicity by U.S. officials in Central American
drug trafficking.
   Jose I. Blandon produced a document Noriega sent to the
country's U.S. diplomatic offices in February saying he has proof
that American officials knowingly established policies that
supported people in the drug business.
   Blandon, a former intelligence official and consul general who
defected last year, mentioned Panama, Guatemala and Costa Rica.
   Jackson says he agrees with the Reagan administration that
Noriega should step down, but he has accused U.S. officials of
overkill in trying to achieve that goal through economic sanctions
that have contributed to economic paralysis in Panama.
   Jackson, appearing Monday in Milwaukee, renewed his call for
Noriega to leave Panama and released a letter in which Noriega
rejected ``any political and economic program that will be dictated
from Washington, D.C.''
   ``My duration as commander and chief of the defense forces is
governed by the Panamanian constitution and law of the defense
forces,'' Noriega's letter said.
   While releasing the letter, Jackson renewed his call for Noriega
to go into exile.
   ``I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the
Panamanian people for General Noriega to leave,'' Jackson said.
``Today I reiterate my public moral appeal for him to depart.''

   Soldiers fired at ``suspicious shadows''
Tuesday in south Lebanon and fought Palestinian guerrillas trying
to cross the border, killing two, the army said. Four Israelis were
reported wounded.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters,
putting out the left eye of a 16-year-old Palestinian, the army
said. It was among the few violent incidents in a relatively quiet
day in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, where an Arab rebellion
began Dec. 8.
   Forty-one high school students about to be drafted wrote Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin saying they would would ``not take part in
acts of oppression and occupation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.'' The number writing such letters now stands at 107.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz went to Jordan and Syria
promoting the U.S. peace plan. He got an inconclusive response from
King Hussein of Jordan, whose approval is considered essential.
   The attempted penetration Tuesday was the ninth infiltration
effort since Nov. 25, when a guerrilla in a hang glider flew into
Israel from Lebanon and killed six soldiers before being shot to
death.
   That attack was thought to have made the Israeli army seem
vulnerable, and violence in the occupied territories began two
weeks later. At least 138 Arabs and an Israeli soldier have been
killed during the 4-month-old rebellion in the lands Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said violence in the West Bank
and Gaza has emboldened guerrillas.
   ``The fact that the events in the territories are the focus of
world attention obligates them ... to prove again that terrorism
has to be the main tool for achieving political goals,'' he said on
army radio.
   ``They've increased their attempts, and certainly they will
continue to try as often as possible to attack Israeli targets.''
   Israel radio said Fatah, the main Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrilla group led by PLO chief Yasser Arafat, took
responsibility in a statement at Sidon in south Lebanon. A
anonymous telephone caller made the claim to a journalist in Sidon
but Fatah's Beirut office denied knowledge of such a claim.
   Another guerrilla group, the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, claimed responsibility in a typewritten
statement distributed in Sidon. It said the purpose was to
emphasize ``rejection of the imperialist plans carried by Shultz.''
   An army spokesman said troopers saw ``suspicious shadows'' early
Tuesday at the edge of Israel's self-declared ``security zone,'' an
area just north of the border with Lebanon that varies in depth
from six to 10 miles. It is patrolled by Israeli troops and a
surrogate militia called the South Lebanon Army.
   The soldiers fired, the shadows disappeared, and blood and
abandoned weapons were found on the ground in the area, he said.
   Several hours later, soldiers encountered guerrillas within a
mile of Israel's border north of the Kfar Yuval farming settlement
and exchanged fire with them, according to the army report.
   It said the Palestinians were armed with assault rifles, a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher and about a dozen grenades.
   Army spokesmen said the encounters took place more than two
miles apart and it was not clear whether they were related.
   ``The soldiers seized positions,'' a unit commander identified
only as Col. Motti said on Israel radio. ``We were 10 meters apart.
We spoke to them, called upon them to surrender. They responded
with fire.
   ``An additional force was positioned behind the terrorists. At
5:30 a.m., the commander of the region ordered the soldiers to
storm the guerrillas.''
   Army spokesmen did not say how many guerrillas there were or
whether any were captured or escaped.
   Helicopters and armored vehicles searched the area after the
battle, the radio said, indicating the army thought some
Palestinians may have escaped.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters
in the Nuseret refugee camp, and Abu Hajad Ramzi lost his left eye,
said Ilana Zeev, spokeswoman at Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon, an
Israeli coastal city.
   An Israeli car was set afire after the driver, a Jewish settler
from Kiryat Arba in the West Bank, got lost in Gaza and wandered
into the strip's Deir al Balah refugee camp, Israel radio said. It
said the driver fired shots into the air and ran with his passenger
to a nearby military post.
   Soldiers destroyed four homes of Palestinians suspected of
inciting protests, three in the northern West Bank village of El
Yamun and one in Gaza City, army and Arab reports said.

<HEAD>Homeowners Would Pay More for Natural Gas if Pipeline Policy
Changed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residential natural gas rates will increase if
interstate pipelines are permitted to serve large industrial users
directly, a group of gas distribution companies and others said
Tuesday.
   An industry organization, the Process Gas Consumer Group,
disputed the claim.
   The distribution group, led by Southern California Gas Co. and
Associated Gas Distributors, an East Coast trade association,
presented the summary of a study of 14 unidentified gas
distribution companies.
   The summary said that if all industrial customers on 13 of these
systems who could be served directly by interstate pipelines were
to shift to the pipelines, rates to other customers would have to
rise by 1 percent to 21 percent. The median rate increase was 5.7
percent.
   The increases would occur because the fixed cost of the
distribution system would be spread over a smaller number of
customers. An earlier study by the Consumer Federation of America
estimated that distribution companies could lose $2 billion in
revenues if industrial customers could switch to direct service by
the interstate pipelines.
   There are only a few such ``direct service'' customers now,
often a factory that years ago chose to locate itself in an
isolated area directly on a pipeline route, or was already there
when the pipeline was built.
   The distribution group held a news conference to call attention
to its support of a bill introduced last month by Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass. He wants to prevent the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission from approving so-called ``bypass'' service over the
objections of state regulators.
   A Markey aide, Cathy Hurwit, said he introduced the bill because
``when large customers can get off the system and come back on at a
later date, you do have some concerns that the remaining customers
are paying more than their fair share.''
   Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the subcommittee with
jurisdiction over the bill, has said he does not want to deal with
natural gas issues this year. Nonetheless, Rufus McKinney, lobbyist
for Southern California Gas, said he was optimistic that backers
could at least win hearings on the issue.
   Jan Vlcek, counsel to the Process Gas Consumer Group, said his
group opposed the Markey bill because, ``There isn't a great deal
of confidence in public service commissions in a lot of states'' to
protect industry, who, he said, often is paying more more than its
share of distribution company costs.
   ``This is cast as industry vs. residential customers. I dispute
that. There's a third party in these transactions, the shareholders
of the distribution company,'' who, Vlcek said, were earning in
some cases 16 percent to 17 percent on their investment.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Henry Bellmon signed a controversial
resolution Tuesday requiring the Confederate flag be flown over the
state Capitol, but said the flag pole would remain empty until he
knows which kind of Confederate flag to display.
   During debate on the bill, black legislators urged colleagues
not to adopt the resolution, saying the Confederate flag was an
offensive symbol of racism and slavery and had been used by
organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan.
   Bellmon's announcement came at a news conference the day after
the author of the resolution, state Sen. Herbert Rozell, said he
would refuse the governor's request to recall the bill and change
it.
   In asking for the recall, Bellmon said the bill did not
stipulate which of the three flags used by the Confederacy between
1861 and 1865 should be flown.
   Rozell said Monday the resolution was written in a way so
Bellmon ``could fly the flag that is the least offensive.''
   But Bellmon said Tuesday, ``If I chose any one of the three I'm
going to be criticized for it.''
   The flag has sparked controversy in several other southern
states recently. Opponents say the Confederate flag is a symbol of
oppression and slavery; supporters say it is historic, not a racial
symbol.
   In Georgia, legislators have introduced a bill to redesign the
state flag, which incorporates the design of the Confederate
banner, and in Alabama, black lawmakers were arrested for trying to
remove a Confederate flag from atop the Capitol dome.
   For years, the Stars and Bars flag used by the Confederacy until
1863 was part of a 14-flag display south of the Capitol steps. The
display was removed during recent reconstruction and Office of
Public Affairs Director Helen Arnold said she did not plan to have
it restored.
   Rozell then introduced the resolution to require the flag
display be resurrected.

<HEAD>Bush Plans Fund-Raisers As Campaign Nears Giving Limits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush plans fund-raising
stops in Texas, Florida and New York during the next week even
though his well-heeled campaign is nearing the federal limit on
contributions, aides said Tuesday.
   Bush is close to collecting the maximum allowed by federal law
for spending on primary campaigns and may reach that level in
another few days, Bush aides said. He would be the first 1988
candidate to do so.
   Once the cap is reached, the candidate cannot raise any more
money for his campaign under federal election law. The law permits
$27 million to be raised and spent for direct campaign expenses but
exempts from the limit legal and accounting costs.
   The campaign had set a goal of $33 million.
   ``Once you get to the `max,' that's it, you can't pull in any
more dollars,'' said Bush spokesman Peter Teeley.
   However, Teeley said, ``we could raise money for other
candidates, we could raise money for the party or state
organizations.''
   Exactly what would be done with money that comes in after the
limit is reached hasn't been decided, the spokesman indicated.
However, the campaign must budget carefully from now on to avoid
spending over the $27 million cap.
   With more than four months to go to the GOP convention, Bush has
the Republican nomination virtually in the bag. His only major
rival, Sen. Bob Dole, withdrew a week ago, although former
television minister Pat Robertson technically is still a candidate.
   Bush has won 841 delegates so far of the 1139 needed for
nomination.
   Bush was spending most of this week in Washington, ``cleaning up
a lot of paperwork... catching up,'' Teeley said. ``And he'll be
thinking of the future.''
   The vice president flies to Texas on Friday for a fund-raising
event in Fort Worth, then goes to Florida, where he will make
appearances in St. Petersburg and Miami.
   He plans to spend Monday through Wednesday in New York,
including stops in Schenectady, Syracuse, Buffalo, Elmira and
Manhattan. The New York primary is April 19.

<HEAD>FBI Warns Anti-Apartheid Activists of Possible South African Hit
Teams</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid activists in the United States
say they have been warned by the FBI they might be targeted by
South African government hit teams.
   The warnings have taken on special importance in the face of
last week's assassination in Paris of Dulcie September, a
representative of the African National Congress which is fighting
to topple the white minority South African government, the
activists say.
   The ANC blamed the South African government for Ms. September's
shooting death but South Africa denied the allegation. Police
sources in Paris said the killing appeared to be the work of a
professional, and French President Francois Mitterrand said he
would ask South African authorities about the attack.
   The Washington representative of the ANC, Dumi Matabani, said he
was contacted last September by FBI agents who told him they ``had
a strong suspicion that a South African hit squad'' might be in the
United States.
   ``They said they would try and stop it, and told me to be
careful,'' Matabani said. The FBI did not offer any protection but
``they told me that if I was followed, I should take the car number
and call them,'' Matabani said.
   An ANC representative in New York, Themba Ntinga, said his
office had also been warned by the FBI.
   Nomonde Ngubo, a South African employee of the United Mine
Workers in Washington and an anti-apartheid activist, said she too
had been contacted by the FBI several times in recent months.
   Ngubo said the FBI agent had declined to discuss anything on the
phone, and that her lawyer would probably be setting up an
appointment soon for her to meet with representatives of the agency.
   A spokesman for the FBI, Gregory Jones, declined to comment
about the activists' claims. But he added that ``any information
that comes to the FBI's attention about possible loss of life or
violence, we're obliged to pass on to the interested party.''
   In recent months South Africa has increased its attacks against
guerrillas of the ANC, mounting a cross-border raid into Botswana
last week and killing four people. Over the past few years ANC
representatives in Brussels, Mozambique and Zimbabwe have been
targeted for violent attacks.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci charged that
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato called him and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
``cowards'' for not doing more to oust Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega, but the New York Republican said Tuesday he didn't
phrase it that way.
   ``I did not call Carlucci a coward,'' D'Amato said through a
spokeswoman. ``My recollection of the conversation was that (I
said) the inaction would be perceived as cowardly.''
   Carlucci made the allegations in a letter to D'Amato that
followed an emotional telephone conversation the two had last week.
After learning D'Amato had denied the alleged name-calling, Defense
Department spokesman Col. Arnold Williams said, ``I think the
letter probably speaks for itself.''
   In the phone call, D'Amato had complained that the defense
secretary was willing to send 3,200 soldiers to Honduras but would
not send a senior military officer to Panama to tell Noriega to
leave, said Jack Kinnicutt, a spokesman for D'Amato.
   The New York senator was disturbed that the U.S. government had
sent Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William Walker to Panama
on March 21 to speak to Noriega, Kinnicutt said.
   ``You don't send a deputy assist secretary of state to ask him
if he's going to kindly leave,'' D'Amato said at a news conference
Tuesday. ``That's not the kind of messenger or message that Noriega
understands.''
   Writing to D'Amato, Carlucci said he had ``been reflecting on
your emotion-charged telephone call'' during which, he said,``you
charged that I and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are `cowards' and that
we are `supporting a drug dealer.'
   ``I hope you can indicate to me that you, in fact, did not mean
(the charges) as stated,'' Carlucci said.
   Carlucci's letter did not address the substance of D'Amato's
original complaint.
   At the news conference, D'Amato released a letter he sent to
Carlucci in which he said, ``I certainly do not believe that the
Joint Chiefs of Staff are cowards. There is not doubt, however,
that the lack of U.S. action in Panama has made us appear weak in
many people's eyes.''
   D'Amato said he told Carlucci on the phone: ``We are being
perceived as cowards, lacking the resolve to deal with a drug
dealers, a tinhorn drug dealer by the name of Noriega. It's not a
question of questioning anybody's particular manhood or the
patriotism of the Joint Chiefs.''
   D'Amato called on the U.S. government to ask for Noriega's
extradition, and said the use of military force may be necessary to
ensure his ouster.
   ``I am not in a position to say what kind of action with
specificity should be taken but I'll certainly tell you this,'' he
said.
   ``If it's the use of force to remove a drug-dealing dictator who
poses a threat to the United States, to our security, to the canal,
why, then I think we have to use all measures, including force, to
bring about his removal.''

   President Reagan called on other
nations Tuesday to ratify an international agreement to protect the
stratospheric ozone layer from damaging chemicals.
   He made the plea in a statement announcing he had signed
ratification documents in the wake of the Senate's unanimous
approval of the agreement March 14.
   ``But our action alone is not enough,'' the president said.
``The protocol enters into force next January only if at least 11
nations representing two-thirds of worldwide consumption of
chlorofluorocarbons and halons ratify this agreement.
   ``Our immediate challenge, having come this far, is to promote
prompt ratification by every signatory nation,'' he said.
   The agreement, signed in Montreal, Canada, requires countries
that are parties to reduce production and consumption of major
ozone-depleting chemicals by 50 percent by 1999.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, which are used in refrigerants, cleaning
fluids, foam products and _ except in the United States _ aerosol
sprays, destroy the high-altitude ozone layer that screens the
Earth from harmful radiation.

<TEXT>
   China has been given approval to buy an
additional 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Acting Undersecretary Thomas O. Kay said China has already
bought more than 4.9 million tons of U.S. wheat under previously
announced authorizations under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, exporters to can sell U.S. commodities
at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have ranged from less than $20 to more than $40
per ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   The Soviet Union also has been a big buyer of U.S. wheat under
EEP, with purchases totaling more than 11.8 million tons in the
last year. An additional 1 million tons of EEP wheat for the
Soviets were authorized earlier in the week.

   A little-known Massachusetts Republican went to
one of the Kennedy family's early strongholds Tuesday to formally
launch a challenge to the re-election of U.S. Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy.
   Joseph Malone, the 33-year-old former executive director of the
Massachusetts Republican Party, made his announcement in front of
the North End home of another Massachusetts long-shot: Paul Revere.
   The heavily Catholic neighborhood first went for a Kennedy in
152, when John F. Kennedy upset Henry Cabot Lodge in a senatorial
election.
   Malone invoked his Italian heritage and the ethnic diversity of
Massachusetts as he launched his campaign. The Waltham native and
1978 Harvard graduate also invoked the name of Revere, who fought
for ``freedom from unfair taxation, and freedom from an overly
intrusive government.''
   Kennedy, Malone said, represents an older, out-of-date
generation in American politics that solves problems by spending
money.
   Malone said his candidacy would highlight, ``not the `me'
generation, the `we' generation. It's a generation that believes in
the power of the individual, not the power of an ever-expanding
government. It's a generation that seeks real economic opportunity,
not a government jobs program.''
   Malone is a close ally of the last Republican to challenge
Kennedy, Ray Shamie, the retired Walpole businessman who is
currently chairman of the Republican State Committee. Shamie was
among the 30 supporters standing behind Malone and holding a green
campaign sign.
   Malone ran Shamie's 1982 run against Kennedy and another losing
bid by Shamie against John Kerry in 1984.
   Shamie acknowledged that Malone is an extreme long shot against
the veteran senator who has held office since 1962. But he said,
``politics is the most unpredictable business I've been in.''

   President Reagan on Tuesday signed
legislation that gives the Agriculture Department greater leeway to
distribute surplus food commodities to poor nations.
   Under the amendments to the Agriculture Act of 1949, Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng can now measure how much foodstuffs will be
sent against available supplies, rather than having to meet a
strict quota set forth in law.
   The law allows Lyng to disburse these foodstuffs, ``subject to
the availability of commodities.''
   The legislation also requires the secretary to make private
voluntary organizations, in addition to agencies of foreign
governments, eligible to take part in the distribution of surplus
food commodities.
   It imposes for the first time a 45-day deadline for the Agency
for International Development to approve surplus food shipments.
And it extends until 1990 a farmer-to-farmer program in which
American farmers travel to foreign countries to give technical
assistance.

<HEAD>News Media Political Role Overrated, Journalists Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The role of the news media in setting the
agenda for the 1988 presidential campaign is overrated, three
leading journalists suggested Tuesday.
   ``I don't think I'm the finger of God every night on the NBC
Nightly News,'' said anchorman Tom Brokaw during a panel discussion
sponsored by the Gannett Center for Media Studies.
   ``I don't think it's so much the media setting the agenda,''
said Louis D. Boccardi, president of The Associated Press ``as it
is the media having become almost the centerpiece of the process.''
   ``The question is, is anyone setting the agenda,'' said Nancy
Hicks Maynard, vice president of the Oakland, Calif., Tribune. ``If
it is the press, it certainly isn't because of the campaign
coverage.''
   Boccardi said the media have done well covering campaign issues,
but he said there also is a need for ``horse race'' coverage,
stories on who is winning where.
   ``I don't think we ought to particularly apologize for trying to
track and keeping our eyes and hopefully keeping the audience's eye
on where the race is going,'' he said.
   Brokaw said voters set an agenda based on information from a
wide variety of sources including paid political advertising and
the political climate.
   The NBC anchorman said one of the most striking aspects of the
campaign was ``the continuing strength of Ronald Reagan in most
regions of the country.''
   Boccardi said Jesse Jackson has ``established himself now as a
credible candidate'' and that has brought him ``more intensive
coverage.''
   ``He's hotter now than he was a few weeks ago,'' said Boccardi.

<HEAD>FCC Warns Consumers About New Phone Operator Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Tuesday warned consumers about new companies that are charging
telephone callers up to 10 times the rates of the major carriers
for operator-assisted long-distance calls.
   The FCC's warning was prompted by a recent surge in complaints
about these new alternative operator services, known as AOS
companies, said Greg Vogt, chief of the FCC's telephone enforcement
division.
   The agency is trying to determine whether the companies are
acting legally, he said, but ``it is premature to conclude whether
there should be any action at the federal level.''
   The FCC has begun an inquiry to find out about the companies'
operations and the rates they charge, he said.
   ``We don't want to have a knee-jerk reaction that could kill an
industry,'' he said.
   The businesses are competing in a $7-billion-a-year market that
until recently was dominated by American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
They emerged within the past two years to fill the void left when
AT&T stopped paying commissions to hotels and motels on the
long-distance calls made by their guests.
   AOS companies serve mainly the transient public in hotels,
motels and at pay phones as well as hospitals and universities,
handling credit card, collect and third-party billed calls.
   Since January, the FCC has received about 260 complaints from
people who said they were given no indication that an AOS company
was handling their call or that they would be billed at rates other
than those of the company whose long-distance credit card they were
using. In most cases, the AOS company has refunded the disputed
amount, the FCC said.
   At an establishment served by AOS company, callers who dial
``0'' for an operator are routed to the AOS. An operator gets
billing information and then sends the call over a line the AOS
leases from one of the long-distance carriers, like AT&T or MCI
Communications Corp.
   Many of the callers who get connected to an AOS company are
those using a credit card issued by a local Bell phone company or
AT&T, since use of those cards require callers to start by dialing
a ``0.'' Other companies's cards require callers to dial a local or
800 number to place their call.
   Most of the AOS companies have billing contracts with the Bell
companies, which means callers receive the AOS charges along with
their monthly local Bell phone bill. Some AOS companies also accept
payment by other major credit cards, such as MasterCard and Visa.
   The FCC advises that callers ask an operator what company they
work for, what rates they will be charged and how they will be
billed before placing the call. If they are dissatisfied, they
should find another phone, the FCC says.
   Several states have begun considering regulation of AOS
companies because of complaints and some have issued consumer
alerts.
   AOS companies say theirs is a new and growing industry to which
consumers haven't yet become accustomed. The major AOS companies
say their operators are trained to identify themselves to callers
before placing their calls.
   Vogt said, however, that some AOS companies can place automated
calls, which substitute ``bong'' tones for a live operator to
instruct callers on how to proceed with a credit card. There is no
federal requirement for AOS companies to identify themselves, he
said.
   The problems AOS companies present are complex, Vogt said,
adding,``we've never seen a situation quite like this addressed by
the commission.''

   A cook who worked for Carlos Lehder
Rivas in the Bahamas testified Tuesday that he was hired by a
reputed leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Lehder, 38, and a co-defendant are on trial in federal court on
charges of conspiring to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the
United States from Colombia via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas from
1978 to 1980.
   Cook Keith Goldsworthy, 32, testified Jorge Ochoa, identified by
U.S. prosecutors along with Lehder and others as being a leader of
the violent cartel responsible for most of the cocaine shipped into
the United States, hired him and his wife to go to Norman's Cay as
Lehder's chef in 1980.
   Goldsworthy said he cooked for nine or 10 people, taking
Lehder's eight guards their lunches at outposts on the island. He
said everyone ate supper at the same house.
   He also described a raid on Norman's Cay in November 1980. He
said he was told the night before that the raid would occur and was
told he should tell police he was a tourist. He said others on the
island went into hiding.
   He also testified that Norman's Cay guards either carried
weapons or kept them in their cars. He also said Lehder was always
with one of his two bodyguards.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, is charged with only being a
member of the smuggling conspiracy.

   The Soviet Union is issuing evacuation permits
for Afghan Communist Party and government officials to use if they
must flee their country after a Soviet troop withdrawal, a human
rights organization said Tuesday.
   The New York-based group, Freedom House, released a copy of a
blank 3-by-5-inch pass that it said was among 20 captured by Afghan
Moslem guerrillas, who have battled the Afghan government and
Soviet troops since 1979.
   Ludmilla Thorne of Freedom House said the United States issued
similar passes to South Vietnamese government officials when they
were evacuated by air from Saigon in 1975 as the South Vietnamese
capital fell to the communists.
   The copy of the Russian-language Afghan permit bears the emblem
of a red star with a hammer and sickle and the words ``Permit for
Special Evacuation.''
   After the word ``Comrade,'' there is a blank line for the name
of the card holder, followed by ``is granted the right for special
evacuation by air and land transport, with the retention of all
housing and food privileges after arrival at the new site.''
   That is followed by a place for the signature of an ``authorized
person'' and the date. The stamp of the Soviet Embassy in
Afghanistan appears at the bottom.
   On the reverse side instructions in Pushtu, the Afghan language,
inform the bearer that he can bring only one suitcase and no
weapons or food.
   A map of Kabul attached to the document pinpoints two evacuation
points, one near the Soviet Embassy.
   Earlier reports from South Asia have spoken of the existence of
such evacuation passes in Afghanistan.
   The Soviet Union has reportedly begun preparations to remove the
first of its 115,000 soldiers from Afghanistan despite an impasse
in United Nations-sponsored peace negotiations in Geneva.
   Those talks began this year, but Ms. Thorne said the permit
obtained by Freedom House was found in October in the briefcase of
an Afghan intelligence officer who was attacked by Afghan
guerrillas.
   She said it could not be learned when the permits were first
printed or how many had been prepared.
   The evacuees' destination was not specified on the permit, but
Ms. Thorne said it was presumed they would be taken to the U.S.S.R.
if the Soviet withdrawal led to the downfall of the communist
government in Kabul.

   A top U.S. official will go to Central America
on Wednesday to discuss the possibility of opening regional talks
that would bring about U.S.-Nicaraguan diplomatic contacts for the
first time since 1985, administration sources say.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley confirmed
Tuesday that U.S. special envoy Morris Busby will visit Guatemala,
El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica to discuss the changed
situation in Nicaragua.
   Other officials, speaking only on condition they not be named,
said Busby also will discuss the ``timing and appropriateness'' of
a new diplomatic initiative for the region in which both the United
States and Nicaragua's leftist government would take part.
   The two countries had direct talks during the latter half of
1984, mostly in the Mexican resort city of Manzanillo. But the
United States broke off the discussions in early 1985, contending
that the Sandinistas were intransigent and saying that the Central
American peace process then under way was a more appropriate forum
for dealing with regional issues.
   Since then, except for exchanges of pleasantries at social
gatherings, officials from the two countries have not had serious
contact. This is consistent with the Reagan administration's view
that the Sandinista government's principal adversaries are the
Contra rebels and not the United States.
   The Sandinistas, meanwhile, have espoused the opposite view,
contending that the U.S.-backed Contras are a U.S. creation and
that there can be no solution to the Nicaraguan conflict without an
accommodation betwen Washington and Managua.
   Echoing a policy that dates back to 1985, Nicaraguan Foreign
Minister Miguel D'Escoto wrote last week that the United States
``should open bilateral negotiations with Nicaragua to deal with
security issues and to normalize relations between our two
countries.''
   Last November, President Reagan indicated new flexibility in his
attitude on negotiations with the Sandinistas. He said Secretary of
State George P. Shultz would be ready to meet with delegations from
Nicaragua and other Central American countries once serious
negotiations between the Sandinistas and the Contra rebels were
under way.
   That condition appears to have been satisfied by the temporary
cease-fire agreement reached March 23 between the two sides.
   The U.S. officials said they do not believe that arrangements
for regional negotiations will be completed by the conclusion of
Busby's visit.
   One official said the administration wants to proceed slowly on
this issue in order not to undercut the direct negotiations the
Sandinistas and the Contras have planned for next week in Managua.
   ``We don't want to create a competing forum,'' the official
said. In their Managua talks, the warring parties will attempt to
work out a final settlement to the Nicaraguan conflict, now more
than six years old.
   A senior administation official in California with the
vacationing president said conditions for regional talks have not
been met.
   ``What we have right now is a truce, and cease-fire negotiations
begin next week, and we're still working out the cease-fire zones.
So the conditions are not yet present for regional discussions,''
said the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   ``Cease-fire discussions have to get started and we have to see
some progress in those cease-fire discussions to make sure that
they're not just discussions leading to a complete surrender of the
freedom fighters and the total abandonment of their interests,''
the official added.
   Busby is making the trip just a week after taking over as
special envoy, a post that had been vacant since Ambassador Philip
Habib stepped down last August because of an internal dispute over
administration policy in Central America.
   Busby has made several trips to the region since then while
serving as principal deputy to Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams. But Abrams decided that a full-time special envoy for
Central America was needed and Busby was assigned that duty, giving
way to career diplomat Michael Kozak as principal deputy.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III today named
John Shepherd, a former president of the American Bar Association,
as deputy attorney general, the No. 2 post in the Department of
Justice.
   Meese also named Francis A. Keating II, assistant Treasury
secretary for enforcement, to the No. 3 job, that of associate
attorney general.
   Meese made the announcement after a Philadephia lawyer and a
Labor Department official turned down important vacancies. He still
had not named a new assistant attorney general in charge of the
criminal division.
   The nominations of Shepherd and Keating will require Senate
confirmation.
   Meese called them ``two distinguished men'' and said they will
serve in an acting capacity until they are confirmed.
   Such nominations normally are announced by the president, but
Meese announced them at the Justice Department.
   ``The president asked me to go ahead and make these
announcements today from here because the president is at the
ranch,'' in California, Meese said.
   Earlier today, Philadelphia lawyer Arlin Adams said a heavy case
load prevented him from taking the No. 2 position.
   ``Unfortunately, the request came at a time when I was involved
in a number of matters that made my immediate availability quite
difficult,'' said Adams. ``I have so reported to the attorney
general and I've expressed to him my regrets.''
   Meanwhile, a Justice Department source said that Salvatore R.
Martoche, now an assistant secretary in the Labor Department, also
had rejected a request from Meese to take the job of assistant
attorney general in charge of the criminal division.
   Martoche decided not to take the job ``because of the taint
factor,'' said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Martochi said through an assistant at the Labor Department that
he would have no comment on the report.
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney
General William Weld, who headed the criminal division, abruptly
resigned last week out of concern that the nearly 11-month-long
criminal investigation of Meese was hurting the Justice
Department's operations and image, department sources have said.
   The turndown by Martoche represents the second unsuccessful
attempt by Meese to fill Weld's position in two days.
   On Monday, the White House blocked another planned replacement
for Weld, James I.K. Knapp, said a Justice Department source who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Knapp, 45, is a deputy assistant
attorney general in the department's tax division.
   Meese had planned to announce Knapp as his choice to succeed
Weld last Friday, Justice Department sources said. But the White
House held up Meese's plan, pending completion of FBI background
checks on his choices.
   Department sources on Monday declined to specify why Knapp's
name was being withdrawn.
   In his statement, Adams said he was unable to take the post
offered to him by Meese because of a heavy caseload at his
Philadelphia law firm, where he took a job last year after stepping
down from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after 17{ years on
the bench.
   In a brief interview after issuing the statement, Adams said
that ``with such a short time frame it's literally impossible'' to
take the position.
   ``If I had more time perhaps I could work it out,'' said Adams.
He was referring to the fact that the Reagan administration has
slightly more than nine months remaining in office and that Meese
must fill the position quickly.
   Adams said in his statement that he strongly wanted to take the
job.
   He said that in turning down the offer, he had expressed to
Meese ``a pledge of support to the extent that I can assist the
Department of Justice in the months ahead'' with informal advice.
``I assured the attorney general that he need only call on me,''
Adams said.
   Meese wanted to fill the positions vacated by Burns and Weld
plus the No. 3 spot in the department, that of associate attorney
general, before leaving Wednesday on a week-long trip to South
America to speak to officials there on drug-related matters.
   The job that Keating is to fill is being vacated by Stephen
Trott, who was confirmed by the Senate last month to become a
federal appeals court judge.
   Asked Monday night whether he had any qualms about serving under
Meese, Adams said that ``I look at the job as serving the United
States government and the Department of Justice'' and that the
investigation of Meese ``is not dominating my decision.''
   In a brief interview today at the Justice Department, Weld said
the resignations of last week and the criminal investigation of
Meese ``were intertwined.'' He refused to be more specific, except
to say that ``the pendency of the McKay investigation'' was a
factor. Weld was at the Justice Department today for the first time
since resigning a week ago.

<TEXT>
   A study at one New York City high school found
that television may help break down racial and ethnic stereotypes,
researchers said Tuesday.
   The study was conducted at a high school in the Howard Beach
section of Queens, which gained national attention as the site of a
racially motivated killing in 1986.
   ``The good news is that the kids like the ethnic characters on
television and they identify with them,'' said Robert Lichter, a
political scientist who conducted the study for the Center for
Media and Public Affairs. ``The bad news is that they like the bad
characters too.''
   The survey found that black characters are the most popular on
television, and that Cliff Huxtable, portrayed by Bill Cosby in
``The Cosby Show,'' is the most popular character of all.
   Both Italian-American students and non-Italians said that
Italian characters such as Tony Micelli on ``Who's the Boss?'' were
most typical of their ethnic group.
   Jewish students responded the least favorably to ethnic
characters across the board, but also were the least likely to view
them as realistic portrayals.
   In general, the study found that the more students liked
television characters, the more likely they were to regard them as
typical of their racial or ethnic group.
   Huxtable was one exception: although black students
overwhelmingly regarded him as a typical black man, non-blacks were
evenly split on whether he was typical.
   The choice of John Adams High School in Howard Beach was
coincidental, Lichter said. He said he and his wife, sociologist
Linda Lichter, conducted their research several weeks before the
1986 incident in which a group of white youths attacked three black
men, one of whom died.
   The study was co-sponsored by the American Jewish Committee's
Institute for American Pluralism.

   Above-average temperatures and
below-average rainfall and snowpack are producing conditions in
Nevada reminiscent of the dust bowl weather of the 1930s, state
climatologist John James says.
   James, chairman of a newly formed governor's committee on
drought, commented Tuesday as the panel met here to review weather
information and discuss possible water conservation steps.
   James said Western Nevada had the driest February and March on
record and has had only .02 inch of rain in more than 2{ months.
   National Weather Service representatives told the committee that
snowpack in the Sierra Nevadas is about 25-40 percent of normal and
reservoirs in the in northern Nevada and eastern California are at
only half their average levels.
   Temperatures have run above normal in 12 of the past 14 months
in Nevada, James said, adding that such a pattern of high
temperatures and lack of precipitation happened only once before in
the state _ during the 1930s.
   State Engineer Pete Morros, who oversees Nevada's groundwater
resources, said he already has received reports of some shallow
household wells in the Reno area and elsewhere starting to dry up.

   South Florida's coral reefs are making a rapid
recovery from a mysterious illness that bleached them white last
summer, marine scientists say, but now those reefs are threatened
by another potentially fatal disease.
   Dr. Walter Jaap, a researcher for the Florida Department of
Natural Resources, said he's worried about the spread of white-band
disease, which affects elkhorn coral, the branching type that's
common on shallow reefs off the Florida Keys.
   Jaap said he has seen evidence of white-band disease off
Biscayne National Park and near the Grecian Rocks off Key Largo.
   The rocks are on the fringe of a coral reef sanctuary adjacent
to John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, a spectacular preserve
that draws more than a million divers each year.
   ``In some cases off Grecian we were seeing entire colonies that
had succumbed to it,'' Jaap said of the disease.
   He said white-band disease appears to be caused by a bacteria.
   Jaap said the disease could be getting a foothold in areas where
coral has been weakened by turbid water, though that's not always
the case.
   Jaap found evidence of white-band disease last month while
surveying reefs to determine the extent of coral bleaching caused
by another sometimes fatal affliction. The study, funded by the
National Science Foundation, covered reefs off Biscayne National
Park, Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, Looe Key National Marine
Sanctuary and at the Eastern Dry Rocks off Key West.
   He said the coral has made a remarkable comeback from the
bleaching illness.
   ``Only 1 to 2 percent were still severely bleached,'' Jaap said.
``They seem to be starting to regain their color. The reefs in the
shallow waters are almost back to normal. I think that in another
few weeks you'll see most of the coral completely back to normal.''
   The bleaching disease struck coral last summer from the
Caribbean to Palm Beach. Some experts believe the condition was
caused by the unusually long period of high sea temperatures last
summer, the hottest on record.
   The temperatures caused the dark algae covering the coral to
disappear, whitening the coral. The coral eventually dies because
the algae is its source of food.
   Areas killed by the bleaching phenomenon should restore
themselves in two to three years.
   ``The cooler temperatures have had a beneficial effect. If they
are given a reprieve this summer, they'll recover quite well,''
Jaap said.

   Haitian Gen. Jean-Claude Paul tried to import
some 900 pounds of cocaine into the United States in a 1986 deal
which went awry, a Cuban-American who was involved in the plan told
Congress on Tuesday.
   Paul commands the most feared Army unit in Haiti and is
considered one of the leaders of the troubled Caribbean nation,
according to testimony from Osvaldo Quintana to the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics.
   Quintana's testimony in heavily accented English was part of the
panel's ongoing investigation of drug smuggling from Latin America.
   Earlier Tuesday, a convicted marijuana dealer told the
subcommittee that U.S. law enforcement officials were paid to look
the other way while huge amounts of marijuana were shipped to the
United States from Colombia.
   Quintana, a native of Cuba who came to the United States in
1967, had headed Ocean Seafood International, a Miami-based
company. He detailed how he became involved with Paul two years ago
through a business deal offered by Paul's wife, Marie Marielle
Delinois.
   She originally interested Quintana through an offer to sell him
seafood, Quintana testified, but once he went to Haiti to
investigate the deal, it turned into a plan to sent 412 kilograms
(about 906 pounds) of cocaine into the United States through Miami.
   The deal fell through when the people hired to fly the cocaine
from Paul's Haitian farm to Miami stole the drugs, Quintana said.
Paul's henchmen have tried twice to kill him since then, including
one attempt that occurred near the Miami offices of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, Quintana said.
   Quintana is now under DEA protection and Paul has been indicted
for conspiracy in the case. Also indicted March 10 in the same case
was his brother, Antonio, and Mrs. Delinois.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee, noted
that Quintana's testimony shows ``yet another country ... polluting
the streets of our country'' with drugs. Previous testimony before
the subcommittee has centered on Central and South American nations.
   Earlier, Michael P. Vogel testified that marijuana was moved
aboard planes as large as a DC-6, along with shrimp boats and _ on
one occasion in 1983 _ a barge which carried 150 tons of the drug
into a Louisiana port.
   Law enforcement officials were paid off ``when it had to be
done,'' Vogel said. Usually, they were given ``$50,000 or $60,000
to do nothing,'' he said. ``They were paid to look the other way.''
   Vogel did not name any of the officials he said received
payments.
   On one occasion in 1979 or 1980, Vogel said, he and several
other members of his drug smuggling organization met in Panama with
Omar Torrijos, then that nation's leader, and Manual Noriega, to
discuss using a small island off the Panamanian coast for
transshipping drugs.
   Torrijos was killed in a 1981 plane crash and eventually was
succeeded by Noriega, who has been charged in Florida with
involvement in the drug trade. Noriega has denied the charges and
is resisting U.S. efforts to push him out of office.
   The two Panamanians ``were being extremely greedy,'' said Vogel,
since they were seeking payoffs of up to $100,000 per planeload of
drugs.
   Vogel, 37, pleaded guilty in 1986 to charges arising from his
14-year career as a drug smuggler. He told the subcommittee he is
now serving a 12{-year prison term.
   Vogel, a native of Detroit, said he became involved in the drug
business while he was a student at the University of Miami. He
brokered a sale for a friend and ``I made a good amount of money
and lo and behold, I was off and running.''
   Vogel told the committee he only dealt in marijuana because ``I
have moral problems with cocaine.''
   Vogel declined to say how much money he had personally made from
his drug business, but said the organizations in which he was
involved made hundreds of millions of dollars.
   For example, the barge load of marijuana was worth $90 million,
and his organization only paid $30 million for the drug, meaning a
$60 million profit, Vogel said.
   Vogel described one occasion in 1979 or 1980 in which he said a
plane loaded with marijuana was flying from Indiana to Florida, but
had to turn back because the destination was fogged in. The plane's
operators dumped their cargo _ bales of marijuana _ by pushing them
out the door of the plane while flying over northern Georgia in the
middle of the night.
   The emergency plan had been to dump the drugs in the the
Chattahoochee National Forest in northern Georgia, but instead,
Vogel said, he later was told that some of the bales had fallen on
the streets of a nearby town. Vogel said he did not know either the
name of the town or the exact date of the incident.
   Vogel said his organization developed detailed, elaborate
methods of evading U.S. efforts to halt the drug trade.
   Those tactics included intelligence collection and electronic
countermeasures, he said. In addition, smugglers obtained the
frequencies used by U.S. officials for communications, and at one
point, they even had the frequency of Air Force One, the
president's plane.

   A man whose business cards said he had
``poison'' in his head and who organized a community crime watch
program had torture devices in his house and a human head buried in
his yard, police say.
   Police worked in a cordoned-off area Tuesday with shovels and a
backhoe to dig up Robert Berdella's back yard, where the head was
discovered during the weekend.
   A human skull also was found in Berdella's house, police said,
along with another human skull that appeared to be very old and was
discarded as evidence.
   ``We're investigating the possibility he may be linked to ...
unsolved cases of missing persons,'' said Rick Pilgrim, a police
homicide detective.
   Berdella's secret life came to light Saturday after a man who
police say was held captive and sexually abused by Berdella leaped
out of a second-story window of Berdella's house. The man, who had
lash marks on his back and was wearing only a dog collar, sought
help from neighbors.
   Berdella has been charged with nine felonies. Officials said the
22-year-old victim had been held for five days. He was hospitalized
in stable condition Tuesday with injuries to his throat and to his
eyes from an unknown chemical, officials said.
   Police said they found photographs in Berdella's brick and
wood-frame house that showed people being tortured, including the
man who escaped Saturday. The photographs were taken in the house,
which had torture and bondage devices, said Sgt. Troy Cole. He
refused to describe the devices.
   Berdella's neighborhood is in a lower-middle class section of
midtown Kansas City, with two-story houses, no more than 30 feet
apart. Berdella moved to Charlotte Street about 16 years ago.
   Michael Calderon, a neighbor, said Berdella told him about five
years ago he was using his home as a half-way house for runaways
and that young men often visited the house.
   ``I thought he was a father figure to those kids and I got
adjusted to the fact that there were boys at his house,'' said
Calderon.
   Berdella also organized a neighborhood watch program.
   ``He led us to believe he was a nice guy, a leader in the
community,'' Calderon said. ``He was very active and made us feel
like second-class residents because we were not active.''
   Berdella owned a curio shop called Bob's Bazaar Bizarre.
Replicas of skulls, faces of dragons and demons as well as
ornaments from foreign countries were among the items he sold.
   His calling card, according to The Kansas City Times, read: ``I
rise from death, I kill death, and death kills me. ... Although I
carry poison in my head the antidote can be found in my tail, which
I bite with rage.''
   Paul Howell, the father of a missing youth, said he suspected
something was wrong almost four years ago. Howell said his son was
last seen with Berdella before disappearing in 1984.
   When Berdella appeared for a court hearing Monday, Howell lunged
at him and had to be restrained. Berdella pleaded innocent to seven
counts of forcible sodomy, one of felonious restraint and one of
first-degree assault. He failed to post the $500,000 bond.

<HEAD>Publisher Of Lake Charles Newspaper Dead At 94</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Broadus Shearman, a publisher of
the Lake Charles American Press who crusaded against gambling in
the 1950s, has died. He was 94.
   Shearman died Monday at home after a long illness.
   As a result of his crusade against gambling in southwestern
Louisiana, he and four other newsmen were indicted by a special
Calcasieu Parish grand jury on charges they defamed 16 public
officials and three admitted gamblers.
   A special judge appointed to hear the case acquitted the
newsmen, saying every allegation made in articles and editorials
was without malice and was either true or could reasonably be
believed to be true. With legislative help casinos and slot
machines were eventually eliminated.
   In 1977, Shearman was cited in the National Better Newspaper
Contest for community service for the newspaper's coverage of labor
violence, stemming from a union attack on a construction site in
which one man was killed and several people were injured.
   Legislators cited the newspaper's work as a key to getting the
state's right-to-work law passed.
   Shearman was born June 27, 1893, in Olympia, Wash., and entered
the newspaper business as an advertising salesman for The Chicago
Tribune in 1914.
   He bought the Lake Charles paper in 1943 and acquired the
Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record in 1933 and the Hobbs (N.M.) Daily Sun
and the Trinidad (Colo.) Chronicle News in 1936.
   Shearman also was active in the oil and gas business.
   He is survived by four children and a sister. One son, Hugh
Shearman, manages the Lake Charles and Trinidad papers. A grandson,
Bill Shearman, is publisher at Hobbs.
   Although Shearman was no longer associated with the Roswell
newspaper, a daughter, Marge Beck, is married to Robert Beck, the
Roswell publisher.

<HEAD>Closed Meetings of Recreation Commission Violated Law, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential advisory commission on
recreation held 34 closed meetings in violation of the law,
congressional investigators said in a report released Tuesday.
   However, the General Accounting Office report released by Rep.
Don Young, R-Alaska, also concluded that the violation ``may not
have had a material impact on the commission's operations and its
final report and recommendations.''
   The commission chairman said he never realized so many minor
get-togethers like informal lunches would count as ``meetings.''
   The 15-member group in question, the President's Commission on
Americans Outdoors, was organized in September 1985 under an
executive order issued by President Reagan and made its report in
December 1986.
   The GAO report appeared to uphold many complaints by a group
opposed to the commission's recommendations, the National Inholders
Association. An ``inholder'' is an owner of private property
surrounded by public land, such as the owner of a home in a
national park.
   A lawsuit filed by the group to overturn the report got nowhere
when a judge ruled that it could not sue because it had failed to
protest when the alleged violations were occuring.
   The commission was formed as a government advisory committee,
which meant that it had to hold its meetings in public with a
15-day notice, a designated federal official had to attend each
meeting and detailed minutes had to be kept. Permission had to be
sought from the host agency head to close a meeting, and reasons
for closing it had to be submitted.
   ``The (Interior) department committee management officer thought
that responsibility for (the act's) requirements was being handled
by the commission, but commission officials were unaware that such
a transfer of responsibility had occured,'' the GAO report said.
   As a result, and despite an extensive campaign to generate
public advice, the commission published notices for only 18 of its
60 meetings, and only 10 were published in time; proper procedures
for closing 34 of the 60 meetings were not followed; minutes were
kept for only 27 of 60 meetings and the department employee
designated to attend commission meetings attended only 11.
   Lamar Alexander, a former governor of Tennessee who was chairman
of the commission, said in written comments: ``I did not ever
imagine that a `meeting' could be a lunch among a few of the
commission members where no decisions were reached or a staff
working session which some commission memebrs briefly attended. If
such an unusual definition of `meeting' is what Congress really
intended, then perhaps GAO officials could visit commissions like
ours when they begin and say that.''
   Rick Ventura, assistant secretary of Interior for policy, budget
and administration, wrote that the department was reviewing its
procedures and would make sure that similar presidential
commissions assigned to it would be served by staff familiar with
the law.
   Charles Cushman, executive director of the National Inholders
Association, said the commission ``operated in a vacuum and made
silly recommendations'' that it might not have made if the
requirements had been met.
   But Derek Crandall, president of the American Recreation
Coalition, a trade association, said Cushman ``could not be more
wrong. ... We had an extraordinarily open process, and did nothing
in camera.''

<HEAD>Trump Agrees To Pay $750,000 Penalty To Settle Antitrust Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York real-estate magnate Donald Trump
agreed Tuesday to pay a $750,000 civil penalty to settle an
antitrust lawsuit stemming from his attempted takeovers of Holiday
Corp. and Bally Manufacturing Corp.
   Trump agreed to pay the penalty to settle a suit filed by the
Federal Trade Commission alleging that his 1986 stock purchases in
the two companies violated the notification procedures required by
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
   The law requires that buyers must notify the government before
purchasing more than $15 million worth of voting stock in a company
and wait 30 days before completing the transaction.
   The FTC complaint, filed in U.S. District Court along with the
proposed settlement agreement, charged that Trump violated the law
by failing to notify the government of Holiday stock acquisitions
made between Aug. 22, 1986 and Oct. 17, 1986.
   The complaint also charged that Trump committed the same
violation when he acquired more than $15 million in shares of Bally
stock between Nov. 13, 1986 and Dec. 1, 1986.
   The settlement is the second in two days by the FTC involving
the so-called ``parking'' of stock with a brokerage house.
   On Monday, the Belzberg family of Canada agreed to pay a
$400,000 penalty to settle a similar suit arising from its attempt
to buy a controlling interest in Ashland Oil Co.
   Both cases involved the purchase of stock options through Bear,
Stearns & Co., which, in turn, bought actual shares. The FTC
contends that the subsequent exercise of the stock options was
covered by the notification procedures of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
   In a statement, Trump said he decided to settle the case ``to
avoid protracted litigation within the federal government over a
highly technical disagreement between the FTC and the business
community.''
   Trump said ``I firmly believe that I was in full compliance with
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act reporting restrictions.''
   Trump said ``the most respected lawyers in the business'' told
him the law exempted the purchase of stock options. ``Bear, Stearns
also gave me the same assurance,'' Trump said. ``I assume Bear,
Stearns will reimburse me for the expense.''
   A Bear, Stearns spokeswoman said the company had no immediate
comment.
   Wickes Cos. agreed last month to pay a $300,000 civil penalty to
settle a similar complaint. Bear, Stearns also served as the broker
for Wickes Cos.

<HEAD>USDA Defining Federal Limits on Payments to Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public comments are being sought on how to
define a ``person'' for purposes of determining federal limits on
payments to farmers, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   There are limits on federal payments to individuals, including
benefits paid under commodity price support programs, the
Conservation Reserve Program and some other programs where direct
payments are made.
   Additionally, the proposed rule would determine whether
foreigners will be eligible to receive certain program payments.
   In budget legislation late last year, Congress included a number
of provisions designed to tighten loopholes in USDA's farm payment
regulations, beginning with 1989 crops.
   The law provides, for example, that to qualify for payments a
``person'' must be actively engaged in farming by providing a
significant amount of capital, equipment or land, and personal
labor or management to the enterprise.
   A basic limit of $50,000 per person annually is set on direct
deficiency payments, but this can be ballooned to as much as
$100,000 maximum, depending on a person's interest in other
entities.
   The term ``person'' can include individuals, corporations,
associations, charitable organizations or other entity as
determined by USDA. And that's what the rule-making procedure is
seeking to determine, the other entities.
   A recent study by the department's Economic Research Service
says the law requires the secretary of agriculture ``to give fair
and equitable treatment to trusts and estates and the beneficiaries
thereof, and provides that spouses may be separate persons if their
farming operations were separate prior to their marriage and
continue to be operated separately.''
   Written comments can be sent by May 6 to: Director, Cotton,
Grain and Rice Price Support Division, ASCS-USDA, P.O. Box 2415,
Washington, D.C. 20013.

   An experienced parachutist filmed his own
two-mile death plunge after he fell from an airplane while carrying
a video camera but apparently without realizing he had no
parachute, investigators said Tuesday.
   Officials declared the death Saturday of Ivan Lester McGuire,
35, of Durham, an accident.
   Franklin County sheriff's Capt. Ralph Brown said there was no
foul play and no indication of suicide, although ``a man who has
jumped 800 times ought to remember his parachute.''
   The videotape shows McGuire leaving the plane, apparently
without problems, Brown said. Other parachutists then jump and free
fall, but disappear when they pop their parachutes and McGuire
plunges on toward the ground at 150 mph.
   McGuire, who was carrying a video camera mounted on his helmet,
was filming a student and an instructor at Franklin County Sports
Parachute Center about 20 miles from Raleigh.
   The plane's pilot, Mark Luman, couldn't be found for comment and
had no telephone listing. Brown said the pilot ``wasn't in any
position to see what happened in the back of the plane.''
   There was no answer Tuesday at the parachute center. Nancy
Fayard, wife of club owner Paul Fayard _ who was the instructor on
McGuire's last jump, was quoted in Tuesday's Raleigh News and
Observer as saying: ``No one was aware that he got on the plane
without a parachute. Of course no one knew or they would have
stopped him.''
   The videotape showed the divers making preparations around the
plane's door; then the camera went out with McGuire.
   With the camera aimed up toward the plane, the tape then shows
the instructor and the student jump and freefall somewhat above
McGuire.
   The jump appeared to be proceeding normally until the instructor
and student opened their parachutes and receded rapidly from view
as McGuire hurtled below them.
   ``It kind of appears he reached for his parachute and didn't
have one,'' Brown said. ``But the release for his (McGuire's)
parachute is on his right hip, and when that right hand goes down,
the left hand comes forward and it comes into camera view.''
   After several seconds of jerky motion, the tape shows the ground
approaching. ``Then the pictures get to moving real fast because
he's approaching the ground at 150 mph,'' Brown said.
   McGuire's body was found in woods about 1{ miles from the
airfield. Footage of the final stage of the plunge was destroyed on
impact and what tape remained had to be spliced in places,
officials said.
   Brown said blood samples will show whether McGuire had alcohol
or drugs in his system and test results should be ready in about a
week.
   Although an expert jumper, McGuire could have forgotten to put
on his parachute because of fatigue or preoccupation with his video
equipment, Mrs. Fayard was quoted as saying.
   A Federal Aviation Administration investigator said Monday he
was checking to see if the pilot knew whether McGuire was wearing a
parachute when he entered the airplane, as FAA regulations require.
   Sheriff Arthur Johnson said Tuesday the investigation showed the
pilot thought McGuire was wearing a parachute. But Walter L.
Riggsbee, the FAA investigator, said the video equipment may have
been mistaken for a parachute.

<BYLINE>April Brings Warm Weather
^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The central and southeastern United States enjoyed summery
temperatures in the 80s on Tuesday, with temperatures in much of
the country 15 to 25 degrees above normal for early April.
   Warm humid air covered an area from Texas into the middle
Mississippi Valley, but a cold front that extended from the upper
Great Lakes into the southern Plains led cooler and drier air into
the region.
   Temperatures were in the 80s from Texas into the middle
Mississippi and Ohio valleys and in the Southeast. Readings were in
the 70s as far north as lower Michigan.
   The low temperature for the nation Tuesday morning was 3 degrees
below zero at Yellowstone Park, Wyo.
   Several records were set for high temperatures, including 86
degrees in Athens, Ga., which tied a record from 1978; 83 at
Indianapolis, breaking by 2 degrees a record set in 1873 and tied
in 1929; and 86 degrees in Louisville, Ky., breaking a record of 85
set in 1873.
   Winds gusted to 50 mph early Tuesday afternoon across the
central and southern high Plains. Wind gusts were clocked at 49 mph
at Amarillo, Texas, and at 48 mph at Beatrice, Neb.
   Showers were scattered across western Washington state, and
across parts of New England. Quillayute, Wash., recorded more than
half an inch of rain, and Portland, Maine, recorded half an inch.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 29 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 94 at Meridian, Miss.
   The forecast for Wednesday was showers and thunderstorms from
the eastern two thirds of the Great Lakes through the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys, the middle and southern Atlantic states and into
the central Gulf Coast. Showers will be scattered across the
Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 60s or 70s across much of
the nation, with 80s from the central and southern valleys of
California through the southern Plateau into the Rio Grande Valley
of Texas and from east Texas through the Gulf of Mexico coast into
the Carolinas as well as Florida. Highs will reach the middle to
upper 90s across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures into the 50s were forecast for the northern Pacific
coast and from the upper Mississippi Valley through much of the
Great Lakes and much of New England. Highs were expected in the 40s
from northeast Minnesota across upper Michigan.

   Following two yellow farm horses
temporarily dubbed mules, marchers in a cross-country pilgrimage
for the poor stepped off Tuesday from the small motel where Martin
Luther King Jr. died 20 years ago.
   ``We're trying to stir up the countryside. We're trying to bring
people out to express their outrage about poverty,'' said the Rev.
Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, a civil rights organization founded by King.
   The combination march and motorcade through Mississippi, Alabama
and Georgia was scheduled to begin Monday following a memorial
service on the 20th anniversary of King's death.
   The trek was delayed a day, however, because two mules that were
to pull a farm wagon on the marching portions of the trip failed to
arrive on time.
   The two animals trucked in for the trip Tuesday turned out to be
small yellow work horses but were strapped up to the wagon as the
procession got under way.
   ``Today, they're mules,'' Lowery said as he climbed aboard the
wagon.
   Lowery said SCLC marches often use a mule-drawn wagon as a
symbol of poverty.
   The 30 or so marchers walked about a mile and a half from The
Lorraine before loading the wagon on a rental truck, putting the
horses on a trailer and climbing aboard three vans for a trip to
Marks, Miss., the first stop on the tour.
   The group plans to ride in the vans for the rural parts of the
trip and stage marches and rallies at towns along the way.
   The pilgrimage is scheduled to arrive in Atlanta on April 29.
   Lowery said his group will hold several public hearings on the
trip for a report on poverty to be given to the Republican and
Democratic parties at their conventions this summer.
   ``Most poor people are working people,'' he said. ``They simply
don't earn enough to carry them out of the pits of poverty.''
   In recent years, particularly during President Reagan's
administration, the nation has lost the urgency it once felt to
help the poor, Lowery said.
   ``You're not going to get the private sector, where most jobs
are, to respond until you get public policy that encourages them,
that requires them and offers the incentives for them to provide
job training and job opportunities for those who need it,'' he said.
   Lowery said the cross-country trek was begun at The Lorraine
because King was assassinated there while helping the working poor
by leading a strike by sanitation workers.
   ``We will not let any commemorative service for Dr. King end
with a benediction,'' Lowery said. ``That's why we closed the April
4 event with a pilgrimage as part of the poor people's campaign.''

<HEAD>Bye-Bye Billy Bob's: Honky Tonk Sold At Foreclosure Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billy Bob's Texas went on the auction
block Tuesday and was bought by a local bank that was the largest
creditor of the landmark honky tonk.
   Landmark Bank of Fort Worth, the only bidder, purchased Billy
Bob's Texas and other property owned by Billy Bob Barnett for $8.2
million during a public auction on the steps of the Tarrant County
Courthouse.
   Bank officials declined to comment on their plans for the club.
   The property was owned by Stockyards 85, a partnership
controlled by Barnett.
   One of Barnett's Stockyards development companies, Stockyards
South Inc., filed Tuesday for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code.
   Barnett has been fighting financial problems for almost two
years and closed Billy Bob's Texas on Jan. 7. Lawsuits totaling $2
million have been filed against Barnett's Stockyards interests for
unpaid bills and overdue loans.
   Landmark Bank filed a foreclosure notice on Billy Bob's Texas
nightclub and other Stockyards 85 property on Feb. 9. The
foreclosure documents said Stockyards 85 failed to repay two loans
totaling $10.8 million.
   The 8,000-seat Billy Bob's Texas club, featuring 42 bar
stations, opened in 1981. Although successful in drawing tourists
to the Stockyards District, the nightclub had lost money for at
least a year before its closing.

   A Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young reunion is
planned, and performers will include Mick Jagger and Robert Plant
as Atlantic Records enters middle age with an 11-hour 40th
anniversary party.
   ``This label, perhaps more than any other, followed the move
from R'n'B to rock 'n' roll,'' said Ken Erlich, who will produce
the May 14 show in Madison Square Garden. ``It's a microcosm of
American music from the past 40 years.''
   Among the past and present Atlantic Records performers scheduled
to participate are ex-Who guitarist Peter Townshend and his
vocalist partner Roger Daltrey; Rolling Stones Jagger and Keith
Richards; Blues Brother Dan Aykroyd; drummer Phil Collins as a solo
and with Genesis; Ben E. King; '60s psychedelic acts Vanilla Fudge
and Iron Butterfly; and former Led Zeppelin bandmates Plant and
Jimmy Page, according to a release.
   A CSN&Y reunion is slated, as is a reunion of the remaining
Rascals.
   ``It seems like only yesterday we set up shop in the old
Jefferson Hotel on 56th and Broadway,'' said Atlantic Records
Chairman of the Board Ahmet Ertegun, who co-founded the company in
1948.
   The show, to be televised live on HBO for the final four hours,
pays tribute to a label with an artist roster covering disparate
acts such as innovative jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman and teen
popster Debbie Gibson.
   The show will be divided into four segments, said Erlich, who
has produced several Grammy telecasts as well as last year's
Vietnam veterans show in Washington.
   ``One segment will be dedicated entirely to the Atlantic
classics,'' said Erlich, ticking them off: ``Stand By Me,''
``Stairway to Heaven,'' ``(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay,''
``Woodstock,'' ``In A Gadda Da Vida.''
   A limited number of tickets for the show will be available to
the public sometime soon. Any profits will be donated to charities
selected by the performers.

<HEAD>Report On Election-Day Violence Does Not Pinpoint Responsibility</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A committee appointed to
investigate killings that caused the cancellation of national
elections said it had identified the assailants ``collectively''
but named no individuals, a radio station reported.
   More than 30 people were killed on Nov. 29 as gangs of armed men
rampaged through the streets of Port-au-Prince, shooting at
civilians who fled in panic. Police and military units patrolling
the capital did not intervene.
   The election was stopped after the polls had been open for
several hours. Government-controlled elections subsequently were
held on Jan. 17, but they were boycotted by opposition groups and
the voter turnout was low.
   The military junta in power last fall appointed four civilians
and two army officers to determine who was responsible for the Nov.
29 violence and submit a report by Jan. 15.
   Contents of the report were not made public but Radio Metropole,
in a broadcast Monday, gave some details.
   It said the committee reported it could not identify individuals
responsible for the election day violence, or for numerous
pre-election killings and cases of arson. But the committee report
said it had identified those responsible ``collectively so that the
government can prosecute them,'' Radio Metropole said. It did not
list any groups.
   The radio station said the committee report criticized various
agencies, saying they had contributed to the collapse of order
during the election, which would have been Haiti's first free
balloting in 30 years.
   The broadcast said the committee accused the police of not
providing adquate security, claimed the Ministry of Information had
not properly informed Haitians about their civic duties and said
the courts failed to document the election-day events as required
by law.
   An independent electoral council that organized the balloting
failed to accomplish its constitutional mission and allowed
``foreign powers'' to become involved in national affairs, the
report said, according to Radio Metropole.
   It said the committee recommended payment of compensation for
victims of the violence and their relatives, strengthening the
police force and intensified searches for illegal weapons.
   After the balloting was canceled, the three-member junta
dissolved the independent electoral council and appointed its own
council to oversee the January election.
   Leslie Manigat was elected president and installed in office
Feb. 7, the second anniversary of former dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier's flight to exile in France.

<HEAD>Shotgun Blasts Blamed on War Over Saturday Car Dealer Openings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARREN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war over Saturday car sales in the
heart of the nation's automaking industry is opening up again with
shotgun blasts and shattered windows.
   Leo Jerome's suburban Detroit Oldsmobile and Nissan dealership
lost two 7-by-4 foot panes, apparently for opening on the weekend.
   ``I would either say it's a couple of (competing) salespeople
who took it in their own hands or they hired somebody,'' Jerome
said Tuesday. ``In Detroit, you can hire something done pretty easy
with the right contacts.''
   The Saturday opening controversy has been bubbling in Detroit
for 20 years, and there have been several reports of vandalism.
   Jerome said his business received a telephone call last week. He
quoted a male voice as saying, ``Other salesmen are excited. It's
starting off with a bang. Measure your glass.''
   His dealership has been open on weekends intermittently in
recent years, closing each time after incidents of violence or
harassment, he said. ``We come out and retreat,'' he said.
   He resumed the Saturday hours about six months ago, but didn't
begin advertising the weekend hours until a month ago.
   ``It's getting around that it wasn't a short-term deal,'' he
said. ``We're going to sell cars, even if (other dealerships) are
not. They didn't like that.''
   The Detroit Auto Dealers Association has taken no formal stand
on the Saturday sales issue, said DADA Executive Vice President Dan
Hayes. He said he didn't know how many of the association's
approximately 240 members are open on weekends but said those were
in a small minority.
   Jerome said Detroit is the only major market he knows of where
dealerships are closed Saturdays.
   ``I'm not trying to be a hero,'' said Jerome, who opened Key
Motor Mall in 1965. ``I'm not overjoyed to pay for glass. I'm not
trying to be a cause, either.''
   But Jerome said his business needs all the help it can get.
   ``To cover my overhead, I'll do anything it takes to sell a
car,'' he said.
   Jerome estimated that car sales on a normal Saturday amount to
about half of any single weekday's sales. But a few good Saturdays
in a row can turn loss into profit.
   ``If we can pick up a half-dozen (sales) a weekend, that's 25 a
month, it can be a difference between us being profitable or being
at a loss,'' Jerome said.
   Key employees reporting to work Thursday found two shattered
glass panes and two others riddled with birdshot. Police discovered
evidence that five or six shots had been fired.
   No one was injured and no one, including the dealership's
overnight security guards, heard shots, Jerome said. The guards
were at the back of the property, keeping an eye on the 300 cars
Jerome keeps in stock.
   In 1981 and 1982, Jerome said, cars on his lot suffered about
$300,000 in damage caused by vandalism, ranging from interiors
being set on fire to body paint being badly scratched.
   No one has been arrested in any of the incidents.
   Last July, in Washington, Administrative Law Judge James Timony
of the Federal Trade Commission turned aside government charges
that Detroit auto dealers illegally conspired to close showrooms on
weekends and most weeknights.
   Timony said the agreement to limit hours stemmed from a labor
dispute dating to 1959, when dealers agreed to close on weekends to
keep salesmen from joining labor organizations in the heavily
unionized Detroit area. Since it was a labor dispute, the judge
said, it was exempt from antitrust action.
   A veteran salesman at another Detroit-area dealership that is
closed on weekends said most weekend customers are ``tire kickers''
interested mainly in browsing.
   ``When I first got in this business (in 1967), we were open on
Saturdays and, quite frankly, business was pretty good,'' John
Hillman said from Bill Brown Ford in Livonia. ``Then it just died.
   ``We said to each other, `Hey, guys, we're not paid by the hour.
We just sit here and talk to each other. It's kind of silly,'''
Hillman said.
   Hillman said Bill Brown Ford closed on weekends after he and
other salespeople picketed to protest weekend hours.
   ``I like spending time with my family. If they went to a six-day
work week, I'd quite frankly look for another line of work,'' said
Hillman.

<HEAD>Jackson Sees Justice In Mecham Ouster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson said Tuesday he saw justice and a touch of irony in the
state Senate's action voting Evan Mecham out of the governor's
office after an impeachment trial.
   Jackson, who frequently invokes the memory of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., noted that it was Mecham's move to
reverse the state's King holiday that was among the first of the
governor's troubles. And, he noted, Mecham was voted out on Monday,
the 20th anniversary of King's slaying.
   ``The long shadow of Dr. King seems to hover over Gov. Mecham,''
Jackson said after arriving here to campaign toward Arizona's April
16 Democratic presidential caucuses.
   ``One of Dr. King's favorite sayings was, `The arc of the
universe is long, but it bends toward justice,''' Jackson told
reporters. ``It's a way of saying the wheels of justice grind
slowly, but they grind fine.''

   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, who advocates a
Republican ``politics of inclusion,'' said Tuesday that he believes
Democratic leaders will do all they can to keep Jesse Jackson from
getting the presidential nomination.
   Kean, who has been mentioned as a GOP vice presidential
possibility, said he believes Jackson's candidacy would be opposed
because party leaders believe a black can't win the White House and
because of Jackson's sometimes radical ideas.
   ``They don't think he can win, and they don't want him as
president,'' Kean told reporters.
   The governor, who has endorsed Vice President George Bush for
president, said he believes ``the country is ready'' for a black
president. ``Whether or not the country is ready to vote for Jesse

<TEXT>
   With the flick of a tail and the
wave of a claw, two huge lobsters were freed Monday in the Atlantic
Ocean, safe from seafood lovers after a roundabout landlubbers tour
of the Northeast.
   ``Shirley,'' a 25-pound male lobster, and ``Bob,'' his 19}-pound
companion, went down into the sea off foggy Portland Head Light.
   They had apparently already been hearing the call of the wild
and snacked on seafood in the tank where they were being kept
before their release.
   ``They were real frisky,'' Marine Patrol Officer Donald K.
Lockhart Jr. said. ``They put a quahog (a large clam) in there and
the big one just snapped it up like it was butter. They left a crab
in there overnight and it was gone this morning.''
   The two behemoths almost became a very expensive Easter dinner
in Pennsylvania before an unlikely combination of animal rights
activists, seafood dealers and state officials came to the rescue.
   A 30-minute boat ride from Portland marked a storybook ending to
the rescue mission.
   Dana Neuts, retail manager of Harbor Fish Market in Portland,
and Kevin Hill, owner of Main Line Seafood Co. in the Philadelphia
suburb of Ardmore, had the honor of putting the monster crustaceans
into the water.
   Neuts grabbed Shirley's baseball mitt-sized claws and Hill took
the tail, and the two gently lowered the lobster over the side of
the 35-foot Maine Marine Patrol boat. Bob went into the same
protected cove moments later.
   The two men who make their living from selling seafood agreed it
seemed strange to be returning it to the sea, but in the case of
Shirley and Bob they had no complaints.
   ``It feels great. It really does,'' Neuts said. ``I like the
idea of the whole thing.''
   ``These are well-traveled lobsters,'' Hill said. With his wife,
Vickie, he accompanied the two lobsters on their flight Monday from
Philadelphia to Portland.
   ``We shouldn't be catching lobsters this size. Maine is the only
state that's doing anything to protect them, and that's why we're
here,'' Hill said.
   Maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds. It is the
only state with a legal limit on the maximum size of lobsters.
   Shirley, whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old,
and the smaller companion were rescued from a Philadelphia man who
wanted to serve them for Easter dinner.
   Col. Robert Fogg, chief of the Bureau of Marine Patrol of the
state Department of Marine Resources, said the lobsters had
apparently gotten snagged in the nets of a dragger and were landed
in Rhode Island.
   The lobsters had been trucked from Long Island, N.Y., to Hill's
store, where retired carpenter Art Miller bought them for $287.
   After animal rights activists took up the lobsters' cause, Hill
persuaded Miller to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead.
Pity Not Cruelty Inc., an animal rights group, arranged to turn the
creatures loose and assumed the $40 flight cost.

   A senior official said Tuesday the Reagan
administration is pushing ahead with plans for speedy delivery of
humanitarian aid to Nicaragua's Contras, but the Sandinistas claim
U.S. assistance to the rebels would be illegal.
   Alan Woods, administrator of the Agency for International
Development, said plans are being prepared for air drops of the
food and other aid approved for the rebels last week by Congress.
   The temporary cease-fire agreement signed by the leftist
Sandinista government and the Contras allows for deliveries of
humanitarian aid to the rebels.
   Woods acknowledged at a news conference that Sandinista
cooperation is required and said the issue is being discussed
between government and rebel negoitators.
   ``We would strongly hope that the Nicaraguan government would be
sensitive ... and prepare to allow humanitarian assistance _ food,
medical supplies, clothing and shelter _ to move without
interruption,'' Woods said.
   But Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega on Monday called the U.S.
aid package that was approved by Congress illegal, saying ``we
cannot accept any type of aid to the Contras because it would be
legitimizing the interventionist policy of the United States.''
   Woods said preparations are being made for deliveries to rebels
deployed outside Nicaragua _ presumably in Honduras _ within the
next few days. Contras based inside Nicaragua will receive aid once
they move to cease-fire enclaves agreed to in ongoing negotiations.
   The $49.7 million aid package calls for $17.7 million to be sent
to the Contras and a similar amount to be allocated to help
children who are war victims.
   Woods said private contractors will be hired to carry out
shipments to the rebels by air, while private voluntary
organizations are being contacted to send experts trained to help
children in need.
   He said AID will abide by a provision in the Sandinista-Contra
agreement that only ``neutral organizations'' be allowed to take
part in delivery of the assistance.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Bases in Philippines Needed In Face Of Soviet Buildup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American envoy at the opening of
talks on the future of U.S. military bases in the Philippines said
Tuesday the facilities are needed in the face of a Soviet buildup.
   Ambassador Nicholas Platt said the six bases, where about 20,000
U.S. military personnel and defense workers are stationed, are
critical to security in Southeast Asia.
   Many Filipinos have called for an end to the garrisons, which
they see as a vestige of colonialism.
   Platt said that while U.S. troop strength in the region has
remained constant, the ``Soviet military presence has grown from an
essentially zero base to one of substantial proportions.''
   ``It only requires an overnight shift in Soviet intentions,
given their current capability, to transform this presence into a
serious economic and military threat to the Philippines and to the
region,'' he added.
   U.S. and Philippine officials are reviewing a 1947 agreement
under which the United States operates the bases, the last major
U.S. military installations in Southeast Asia. They technically are
under command of the Philippines but are effectively controlled by
the United States.
   As the talks got under way at a seaside convention complex in
Manila, about 500 people staged a peaceful march to the U.S.
Embassy protesting the bases. Eight imprisoned communist rebels
issued a statement demanding the bases be closed.
   The government has been fighting a 19-year war against communist
guerrillas.
   Spokesmen for the two countries said Tuesday's closed-door
meeting was devoted to drawing up an agenda and agreeing on
procedures for the talks, which are expected to last three months.
   The leases for the bases expire in 1991. Under the new
Philippine constitution, a lease extension must be approved by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases
is strong.
   Philippine negotiators were expected to press the United States
for an increase in the $180 million Manila receives each year for
the bases.
   Platt indicated Washington would resist such demands.
   ``For decades, we have borne the main financial burden for the
defense of the free nations,'' he said. ``Now, the resulting
serious deficits and imbalances must be addressed as a matter of
top priority.''
   He said the presence of the U.S. bases allows the Philippines to
use its resources on economic development and battle the communist
rebels. Platt also predicted more foreign investment in the country
if the bases remain.
   Philippine officials have said they also will press for
information on whether the installations, which include the Clark
air and Subic naval bases and four smaller facilities, are used to
store or transport nuclear weapons.
   The new constitution states that the country opposes such
weapons ``consistent with the national interests.''
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said the talks will be held in
an atmosphere ``of candor and friendship,'' but suggested the
Philippine negotiators will be sensitive to growing opposition to
the U.S. bases.
   President Corazon Aquino has not said if she supports an
extension of the leases.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz discussed
the U.S. peace plan with two Arab leaders at length Tuesday and
said ``the going is very tough.''
   Meeting with reporters on the flight back to Jerusalem, he
reported no ``convergence'' with Israel on Mideast negotiations
during talks with King Hussein of Jordan in Amman and President
Hafez Assad of Syria in Damascus.
   Shultz said he brought with him questions from Hussein to
present on Wednesday to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres.
   Hussein's approval of the plan is considered essential. A senior
Israeli defense official said Monday that Israel might be nudged
into acting on the plan if Hussein accepts it in principle.
   Among points at issue is how negotiations on Palestinian
self-rule, which Shultz hopes will begin May 1, would link with
talks on a final settlement. Shultz would like the second stage to
begin in December.
   He will take answers from the Israelis to Hussein later
Wednesday after a stop in Cairo to see President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt.
   ``I can't report any particular sense of convergence on the
intiative at this point,'' the secretary told reporters on his U.S.
Air Force jet. ``People are raising questions and expressing
reservations.''
   Shultz added, however: ``We continue to think what has been put
forward is basically what can potentially work, so we stick with
it.''
   All sides urged him to continue in his effort for negotiations,
he declared, but ``I don't want to give any big plus sign because
that would not be warranted by the facts.''
   Shamir and Peres are prepared to negotiate with the Arabs on an
overall settlement but ``there are all sorts of questions'' on the
Israeli side, including a connection between Palestinian self-rule
and talks on an overall agreement, Shultz said.
   Israel's Cabinet is deadlocked over whether to accept the U.S.
proposal. Shamir leads those holding out, while Peres and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin favor it.
   In Amman, Shultz and Hussein met for 75 minutes, then had lunch.
In Damascus, the secretary spent two hours and 45 minutes with
Assad and said they had ``sharply different'' views on how to hold
the negotiations.
   ``We think we made a reasonable amount of headway'' however,
Shultz said. April Glaspie, head of the State Department's
Jordan-Lebanon-Syrian desk, remained in Damascus for further
discussions.
   In an interview with Jordanian newspaper editors in Amman,
Shultz ruled out participation in peace talks by the Palestine
Liberation Organization. ``How do you talk to someone who says we
want to exterminate you (Israel)?'' he asked.
   He also said: ``We don't think an independent Palestinian state
on the West Bank makes sense.''
   The interview was videotaped but not shown on early evening news
programs by Jordan's state-run television network. A senior
government source said privately the Shultz comments were
considered ``very much pro-Israeli.''
   Jordanian television usually can be seen in Israel and Syria,
and by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which have been torn by four months of violence.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington
that Hussein had not dropped his insistence that talks with Israel
be held at a peace conference in which the Soviet Union and United
States would take active roles. Israel prefers direct negotiations
with the Arabs.
   Shultz made clear in the Jordanian interview that PLO
partricipation in peace talks is impossible until it accepts
Israel's right to exist and renounces terrorism.
   ``Israel is here. It's here to stay,'' he said.
   Several of the editors questioned whether the United States
could be a fair mediator between Arabs and Israel. The secretary
said Washington is a friend of both sides.

   A day after he was convicted and removed
from office by the state Senate, former Gov. Evan Mecham said
Tuesday he is doing fine but has not decided whether he will try to
get his job back.
   However, Mecham warned that those who ousted him may not realize
they have ``awakened a sleeping giant'' in the Arizona electorate.
   ``I know that they are aroused, I know that they are incensed, I
know that they are right down angry,'' said Mecham, a first-term
Republican convicted in an impeachment trial that ended Monday.
   Mecham _ who described himself as the ``recent former governor''
_ appeared relaxed as he spoke to a Kiwanis Club and said, ``I have
no rancor in my heart for anybody.''
   He was removed from office Monday when the Senate convicted him
of obstructing justice and misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund.
   ``I haven't yet determined what my course will be,'' Mecham
said. ``I haven't yet said that I'm not going to be a candidate in
the recall.''
   Earlier, in a telephone interview from his surburban Glendale
home, he said, ``I'm doing fine. ... I've got a clear conscience
and I haven't done anything wrong.''
   ``This job wasn't the end of the world for me; I didn't need it
in the first place,'' Mecham said.
   Several weeks ago, Mecham had said that if the Senate convicted
him, he might go to the U.S. Supreme Court to claim that his rights
had been violated. He said Tuesday he had not decided whether he
will do so.
   Two Senate leaders _ Republican Majority Leader Robert Usdane
and Minority Leader Alan Stephens _ said there was talk among
senators about reconsidering their vote against excluding Mecham
from holding office again. The two said they opposed reopening the
issue when the Senate meets Wednesday.
   Mecham faces a criminal trial April 21 on charges of concealing
a $350,000 campaign loan. If convicted, he would be barred from
holding office again.
   Meanwhile, Mecham attorney Jerris Leonard told KTAR radio he
does not believe Mecham can run in the May 17 recall because the
Senate removed him from the four-year term he began in January 1987.
   ``My understanding is that he cannot run again until 1990,''
Leonard said.
   The recall election remained scheduled despite the vote removing
Mecham from office and the installation of Democrat Rose Mofford,
the secretary of state who until Monday was acting governor.
   Mecham told the Kiwanis group he expects lawmakers and Mrs.
Mofford to adopt a 10 percent tax increase to make up for a 1988-89
budget deficit estimated at $349 million. Such a tax hike is
unnecessary, he said, although in January Mecham proposed a ``tax
equity'' plan that amounted to a $90 million hike.
   Mecham said he disagreed with Mrs. Mofford's decision to sign
legislation allowing a second weekly lottery game and another
measure allowing new state buildings to be funded through
lease-purchase.
   Leonard said he planned to ask the Senate on Wednesday to
require the state to pay Mecham's attorney fees, which Leonard said
were ``in the range of $300,000.''
   Officials still must decide what to do with the protocol fund,
which Leonard said is in the bank. Mecham's auto dealership repaid
the $80,000 loan that was the subject of one impeachment charge.

<HEAD>Koch Says Other Candidates Are Afraid to Critize Jackson</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mayor Edward I. Koch charged Tuesday that the
other presidential candidates have not challenged Jesse Jackson's
position on vital issues for fear of being labeled as racist.
   ``We have seen the other candidates, up until now, dance around
Jesse Jackson, and the media dance around Jesse Jackson as though
they were afraid they were either going to insult him or his
supporters,'' Koch said. ``I think it would insult him and his
supporters by not treating him equally.''
   Koch maintained that the other presidential candidates have been
afraid to insult Jackson, the black candidate, or his supporters by
questioning his positions on aid to the Palestine Liberation
Organization and on cutting back on defense in favor of vast social
programs.
   Although Koch said Jackson was ``the smartest of all those guys
running,'' he maintained that this didn't mean he'd make the best
president.
   ``But, he knows how to answer. He can defend himself,'' Koch
said. ``He doesn't need presidential security from questions. And
so when the candidates wouldn't take him on, and the media wouldn't
take him on, I decided I would.''
   The mayor was critical of Jackson last Friday saying Jews would
be ``crazy'' to vote for him since he embraced PLO leader Yasser
Arafat.
   He said Jackson's domestic social programs would ``break the
bank'' in three weeks, and his proposed defense cutbacks would
leave the United States ``defenseless'' in six weeks.
   ``It seems to me everybody who's running for president ought to
be subject, with respect to their public behavior and their public
statements and their philosophy, under a microscope,'' the mayor
said.
   ``Aren't you patronizing Jesse Jackson by saying he shall be
spared from having to defend his positions?'' Koch said when asked
if he had had any backlash from his criticism of the Democratic
candidate.
   Koch said, ``I encourage everybody to speak the truth as they
know it. I encourage Jesse Jackson to respond. I encourage Jesse
Jackson to say where are we wrong and also to point out the
infirmities, the moats, if you will, in the eyes of the other
candidates. I encourage that debate.''
   ``Remember,'' he added, ``we're electing a president. This is
not a matter of silence. Silence today is not golden. Silence today
is chicken!''

   In a half-acre building, for sale to the
highest bidder, are many of Liberace's luxurious possessions _
mirrored pianos, furs, classic cars and glittery memorabilia.
   ``It is really sad. We would all rather have Lee here,'' Debbie
Reynolds said Tuesday during a preview of the Liberace Collection.
``There's a little bit of something for everyone.''
   The sale, with items accumulated for decades by the late
entertainer, runs Saturday through Tuesday.
   Liberace, a pianist without peer who symbolized extravagance and
outlandish dress, died Feb. 4, 1987, at age 67 from complications
caused by acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   A Convention Center hall was packed with more than 2,000
treasures, including mirrored Baldwin pianos, furs, classic cars
and furnishings from Liberace's Las Vegas, Nev., home, Los Angeles
penthouse, New York apartment, Malibu Beach house and Lake Tahoe
estate.
   Gaudy, ornate, peculiar, tacky and ordinary all apply.
   There are green, blue, red and purple shoes. There are belts,
hankies, crowns, a sleigh and stuffed animals. A General Electric
Toast-R-Oven, big screen TVs and several videocassette recorders
and stereo speakers.
   Potted phony floral arrangements were everywhere, and there was
a 7-foot-tall climbing bougainvillea and a miniature piano with
silk flowers.
   ``He would go shopping from K mart to Neiman Marcus,'' said Dora
Liberace, the entertainer's sister-in-law and administrator of the
Liberace Museum in Las Vegas. Asked what he would think of the
displays, she said:
   ``He probably would have been right here in front watching it
all go on sale, then he'd go right out and buy more. He loved
shopping and he usually bought two of everything.''
   In addition to a dozen pianos, 13 vehicles, including three
limousines, a Rolls-Royce with a wild brocade interior, a 1977
Chrysler station wagon with piano keys on the side and a 1982 van,
were expected to bring the most money.
   Butterfield & Butterfield and Christie's are conducting the
auction to benefit the decade-old non-profit Liberace Foundation
for the Performing and Creative Arts, which funds scholarships at
28 schools and colleges.

   Gov. Henry Bellmon signed a controversial
resolution Tuesday requiring the Confederate flag be flown over the
Capitol, but said the flag pole would remain empty until he knows
which Confederate flag to display.
   During debate on the bill, black legislators urged colleagues
not to adopt the resolution, saying the Confederate flag was an
offensive symbol of racism and slavery and had been used by
organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan.
   Bellmon's announcement came at a news conference the day after
the author of the resolution, state Sen. Herbert Rozell, said he
would refuse the governor's request to recall the bill and change
it.
   In asking for the recall, Bellmon said the bill did not
stipulate which of the three flags used by the Confederacy from
1861 to 1865 should be flown.
   Rozell said Monday the resolution was written so Bellmon ``could
fly the flag that is the least offensive.''
   But Bellmon said Tuesday, ``If I chose any one of the three I'm
going to be criticized for it.''
   The flag has sparked controversy in several other Southern
states recently. Opponents say the Confederate flag is a symbol of
oppression; supporters say it is historic, not a racial symbol.
   In Georgia, legislators have introduced a bill to redesign the
state flag, which incorporates the design of the Confederate
banner, and in Alabama, black lawmakers were arrested for trying to
remove a Confederate flag from the Capitol dome.
   For years, the Stars and Bars flag used by the Confederacy until
1863 was part of a 14-flag display south of the Capitol steps. The
display was removed during recent reconstruction and Office of
Public Affairs Director Helen Arnold said she did not plan to have
it restored.
   Rozell then introduced the resolution to require the flag
display be resurrected.
   The flag display represents the countries that have claimed a
portion of Oklahoma territory in the past, including France and
Spain. Bellmon has said the existence of the Confederacy and its
control over a portion of Oklahoma are undisputed facts, and the
display is in historical context.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of an extra 1,300 U.S.
troops arrived Tuesday to increase security for American soldiers
and citizens during Panama's political and economic crisis.
   A C-141 Starlifter carrying the first contingent of soldiers
from Fort Bragg, N.C., landed at 4:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. EDT) at
Howard Air Base outside Panama City. Nearly 50 flights are expected
by the time the deployment is finished Friday.
   Reinforcements and a squadron of 26 helicopters are intended by
the Reagan administration as a signal to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the de facto ruler Washington has been urging to step down.
   The buildup, ordered last week to counter what the Pentagon
called Noriega's ``heavy-handed tactics,'' will raise U.S. troop
strength along the 50-mile-long Panama Canal to 11,800 officers and
men. Noriega commands the 15,000-member Defense Forces.
   The reinforcements were sent after reports that U.S. citizens
were harassed by Panamanian soldiers and the brief arrests of
several American reporters during a police raid on opposition
headquarters in a Panama City hotel.
   Panama has repeatedly accused the Reagan administration of
preparing to invade.
   The first flight was from Pope Air Force Base, N.C. Officials
said they expected at least one heavy cargo plane each hour from
Pope and Travis Air Force Base, Calif.
   A statement from the office of Panama's Roman Catholic
archbishop, Marcos Gregorio McGrath, said the government told him
it would hold discussions with the opposition, mediated by McGrath.
   McGrath was asked to mediate by President Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and former Presidents
Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela.
   The civilian government, which Noriega controls, has accused
McGrath of siding with the opposition. State-run newspapers have
called the archbishop, who was born in Philadelphia, a ``tool of
the Yankees.''
   Police halted two opposition demonstrations before they started
Tuesday, sealing off the site of one and appearing in force at a
park where another was to take place.
   The U.S. national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell,
said Tuesday in Santa Barbara, Calif. that the United States had no
plans to send more forces to Panama but ``would not eliminate that
possibility.''
   U.S. sanctions imposed in February have produced the gravest
economic crisis in the history of Panama, which uses the U.S.
dollar as its currency. Banks closed more than a month ago the
government has been unable to pay its employees.
   Tuesday's editions of government newspapers carried a statement
from Panama's Health Ministry ridiculing the new American troops
and calling them potential AIDS carriers.
   It said tests by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
showed U.S. military personnel have ``a high rate'' of infection
with the aquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.
   ``Knowing their clinical history, we can do no less than exhort
our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with
these soldiers,'' the statement said.
   A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control said it does not
test military personnel. The Defense Department began doing so in
1985 and reported these figures Sept. 30, at the end of the 1987
fiscal year: 5,890 tests positive in a total of 3.96 million,
including 3,336 positive among 2.18 on active duty.
   The U.S. Southern Command, with headquarters near Panama City,
had about 600 security people among its 10,000 personnel before the
Reagan administration stepped up its campaign to oust Noriega early
last month.
   In mid-March, the Pentagon sent 670 more security personnel to
Panama to help protect military facilities.
   The primary task of all U.S. personnel in Panama is to safeguard
the canal until it is handed over by treaty to the Panamanian
government Dec. 31, 1999.
   About 13,000 military dependents also live in Panama, along with
1,300 U.S. employees of the Panama Canal Commission and their 2,600
dependents.
   On Monday night, Panamanian security agents Monday night
surrounded the home of Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the
Christian Democratic Party and one of Noriega's chief opponents.
They remained there Tuesday.
   Luis Camacho, an aide who was in the house, told The Associated
Press by telephone Arias Calderon was not at home.
   Arias Calderon returned to Panama two weeks ago from a month in
the United States. He had been refused permission to return from a
business trip Feb. 25.
   On that day, federal courts in Florida unsealed grand jury
indictments charging Noriega with drug trafficking and money
laundering. The following day, Noriega's figurehead president, Eric
Arturo Delvalle, tried to fire the general as Defense Forces
commander but lost his own job instead.
   The United States still considers him Panama's legitimate
president, and has frozen all Panamanian bank funds in the United
States.

<HEAD>Laughing Gunmen in Massacre of 28 Yelled ``Kill Everyone You

<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Gunmen laughed and screamed ``Kill
everyone you can!'' as they massacred 28 villagers at a rural
Easter festival, newspapers in the capital reported Tuesday.
   The hooded killers shot dead an elderly, one-legged man as he
struggled to get on the donkey and flee, the Bogota daily El Tiempo
quoted an unidentified survivor as saying.
   A 10-year-old boy, Oscar Sierra, who was among those ordered to
lie face down in the dirt and not look up, was shot in the head at
point-blank range by one of the killers when he lifted his head,
another survivor was quoted as telling an El Tiempo reporter.
   One other child, a 14-year-old boy, was also killed in the
Sunday bloodbath.
   There were conflicting reports on the number of wounded, ranging
from 10 to 15. A death toll of 33 given Monday was revised downward
to 28 Tuesday by Gov. Jose Gabriel Amin Manzur of northwest Cordoba
state.
   The governor said police and the army suspect the massacre was
the work of leftist guerrillas, El Tiempo said.
   However, the murders had all the earmarks of the work of a
right-wing death squad.
   El Tiempo and another Bogota daily, El Espectador, sent
reporters to the scene, a thatched roof hut in remote mountains
where about 200 people were celebrating the end of Holy Week.
   The area, know as Mejor Esquina, lies 280 miles west of the
capital city of Bogota and has about 50 families, with no house
closer than 1,500 feet to its neighbor.
   Here is what happened, according to the accounts given reporters:
   The traditional partying started Saturday afternoon, with an
eight-piece band of guitars and accordions playing the songs dear
to Colombian peasants _ballads of hard-working cowboys, lost love
and happiness amid poverty.
   A pig was slaughtered for the feast and chickens were killed.
   Sunday started off with horse races. In the afternoon there was
a dance for the children in the small farmhouse made of mud bricks.
   Women cooked stew in huge pots throughout the afternoon and the
men drank beer and aguardiente, a Colombian liquor with a faint
taste of licorice.
   In the evening, the peasants danced and shouted to each other
over music blaring from large speakers. Only a few noticed vehicles
park about 150 feet away with lights out.
   Some people said there were about 10 gunmen. Others said there
were as many as 20. Some said they wore military jungle clothing.
Others said they wore police uniforms.
   One thing all survivors agreed on was the gunmen laughing
crazily as they fired repeatedly into the crowd amid shouts,
screams, the hysterical crying of children.
   Some people ran into the hut, and gunmen followed, firing as
they entered.
   Jose Llorente said he survived because the bodies of dead
friends lay atop him as the killers fired into the room.
   No one in the band was killed. One gunman smashed an accordion
and whacked the musician across his backside with the flat part of
a 2-foot-long machete.
   The shooting lasted about 20 minutes and the gunmen became more
selective in choosing victims. Eight people were shot in the back
of the head as they lay face down in the hut.
   The gunmen left, warning survivors to keep their faces in the
dirt for five minutes.
   ``Then you can look up and cry over what you find, you sons of
bitches!'' one attacker shouted.
   That is when the 10-year-old boy was shot for lifting his head.
   The sound of the vehicles died out and the village was filled
with the groans of the wounded, cries of people calling for loved
ones, the agonized whinnying of injured horses.
   The next day, in nearby Planeta Rica, someone painted on a wall,
``The Magnificient Ones are here to clean things up.''
   There are a dozen right-wing death squads in Colombia with names
like the Vampires and the Crickets. This the first time the
Magnificient Ones had been heard of.
   Death squads have killed about 600 people in the last three
years.
   The left says the army is behind killings. The army denies it.
The government says it has been unable to find out who organizes
the death squads.
   So far no one from any death squad has been caught.
   Leftist guerrillas draw combatants from rural areas, and Mejor
Esquina may have been one of them.
   At the school, a guerrilla slogan _ Long live the Popular
Liberation Army _ has been painted near the entrance.
   The schoolmaster, Tomas Berrios Wilches, was among those killed.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Condemns Foreign Interference In Ethnic Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev lashed out Tuesday at
foreigners he said were trying to aggravate an ethnic dispute in
the southern Caucasus.
   ``They are trying to interfere in our internal affairs, to
exacerbate problems from the outside and (are) engaging in
provocations,'' he said. ``At present this is particularly visible
in connection with the events around Nagorno-Karabakh.''
   His comments were similar to recent remarks in the official
press condemning purported outside interference in the dispute over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan that Armenians want
attached to their republic.
   The Soviet leader's remarks came at a Kremlin meeting with Willy
Brandt, head of the Socialist International and a former chancellor
of West Germany. The official news agency Tass reported on the
meeting.
   Gorbachev singled out broadcasters for criticism.
   ``Various radio stations, including official ones, have joined
in the subversive activity,'' he said. ``Especially active ... is
Deutsche Welle (West German radio).''
   Tass did not say how the radio stations were purportedly being
subversive, but other Soviet reports have accused Western
journalists of sharpening tensions between Armenians and Azeris,
the dominant ethnic group in Azerbaijan.
   Gorbachev told Brandt, ``We will handle problems that have
accumulated, including on the nationalities issue, within the
framework of the democratic process we have firmly chosen.''
   Soviet newspapers reported Tuesday that four businesses have
gone bankrupt in Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh,
because of a strike but that workers have been returning to their
jobs in increasing numbers.
   The first reports that workers were returning to their jobs came
Friday. The government newspaper Izvestia reported Tuesday that
workers were continuing to go back to work to their jobs because of
repeated appeals by Communist authorities.
   Workers began striking in Stepanakert on March 24 to protest
government refusal to turn the city and the surrounding region,
Nagorno-Karabakh, over to the Armenian republic. Most of the
region's 160,000 residents are ethnic Armenians but since 1923 it
has been part of the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament,
announced a plan on March 23 for $690 million in economic, social
and culture improvements for Nagorno-Karabakh, which some Armenians
say has suffered under the control of Azerbaijan.
   Izvestia said that in Stepanakert on Tuesday, all workers of the
building materials plant showed up as did more than half of the
employees of the electrical engineering works and silk mill. About
a third of the workers of the shoe and furniture factories reported
for work, it said.
   The annexation issue touched off demonstrations and strikes in
Nagorno-Karabakh on Feb. 13, and the unrest spread to the Armenian
captial, Yerevan. The dispute led to ethnic rioting Feb. 28 in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait that left at least 32 people dead.

<HEAD>Dalai Lama Says He May Be Willing to Meet Chinese Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader in exile,
said Tuesday he may be willing to meet Chinese leaders in Beijing
to discuss the future of his homeland.
   ``I feel the more time goes on, there may be more room to
develop human understanding,'' he said in a television interview.
``We need more patience, more determination. I am trying to find
some way, a middle way, or some kind of compromise.''
   ``If circumstances really became more favorable and more
positive, I would have no hesitation to go'' to the Chinese capital
to discuss Tibetan independence, he told Britain's commercial
Channel 4 network.
   The 52-year-old Dalai Lama arrived Monday on a 12-day private
visit.
   He chided Britain for not being more openly critical of China's
control of Tibet. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet to exile in India in
1959 after an abortive Tibetan uprising against the Chinese.
   He said Monday that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government had asked him to refrain from making
political statements during his visit, which he said will be mainly
devoted to Buddhist teaching.
   Published reports have suggested Britain does not want to upset
China in the period leading up to the transfer of Britain's Hong
Kong colony to China in 1997.
   China, which claims Tibet has been an integral part of the
nation for centuries, moved troops into the remote mountain region
in 1950. Many Tibetans resent the Beijing government because of
opression of Tibetan religion and customs and the destruction of
temples during the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution in 1966-76.

<TEXT>
   A jury deliberated a second day Tuesday
without deciding the fate of 13 people, nine of them accused of
conspiring to violently overthrow the U.S. government and establish
an Aryan nation.
   At midafternoon, the jury asked U.S. District Judge Morris
Arnold for a trial transcript. Arnold sent jurors a note saying a
transcript would be about 7,000 pages and would not be ready for
three or four months.
   He told jurors that recordings of long portions of testimony
could not be played for them and they should rely on their memory
and notes. The jury was to resume deliberations Wednesday.
   The case went to the jury on Monday, after a trial that began
Feb. 16 and included 192 witnesses.
   Defendant Richard G. Butler told reporters Tuesday that the
trial is a move by the government to snuff out views that do not
meet its approval. He said he expects to be acquitted, but added,
``In any case, they win _ they break us financially.''
   Butler and defendants Robert E. Miles and Louis Ray Beam Jr. are
considered among the leaders of the white-supremacist movement in
the United States.
   One of Beam's lawyers, Kirk Lyons, said acquittal would slow the
movement more than a guilty verdict because it would show that
white supremacists ``can get a fair trial in American courts. If
acquittal comes back in this case, it will go a long way toward
neutralizing the right wing. If they're convicted, the right wing
will think they've been shanghaied.''
   Besides the nine people accused of seditious conspiracy, which
carries a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $20,000 fine, five
defendants are accused of conspiring to kill federal officials and
two of transporting stolen money across state lines. The murder
plot could be punished by life imprisonment; the transporting
charge by a term of 10 years plus a $10,000 fine.
   A key government witness was James Ellison, who is serving 20
years for racketeering. He led a white-supremacist group named the
Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord. His group carried out
bombings in furtherance of a conspiracy, he testified, that was

<HEAD>U.S. Welcomes Japanese Crackdown On Strategic Arms Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department on Tuesday praised
Japan's ``new energy and dedication'' in tightening controls on
sales of strategic exports to communist countries.
   Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said Tokyo's reported crackdown on two Japanese
firms accused of violating export regulations in the sale of
electronic measuring equipment to China ``demonstrates Japan's
serious regard for protecting sensitive technology.''
   ``We are beginning to see actions that demonstrate Japan's
commitment to a strong and effective export control regime, a
commitment that has recently been reinforced with increased funds
and stronger export control laws,'' Freedenberg said in a statement.
   He added that the latest actions underscore ``the new energy and
dedication of the Japanese government in administering and
enforcing multilateral export control rules.''
   He cited the Japanese government's announcement Monday that it
was investigating alleged export violations by Kyokuto Shokai Co.
Ltd. and Shinseki Koeki Co. Ltd.
   The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
the companies' sales to China occurred in 1985-86, prior to the
tightening of trade laws brought about by the disclosure that
Toshiba Machine Corp. had illegally exported machinery used in the
production of silent submarine propellors to the Soviet Union.

   The search for three killers who
escaped from the West Virginia Penitentiary focused for hours
Tuesday on what turned out to be a false sighting at a restaurant,
state police said.
   ``At first check, it seemed to be them,'' said state police Sgt.
D.E. Cook. ``But after further checks, we couldn't make a positive
I.D.
   ``We retraced all the people who saw them. They weren't the
three,'' Cook said, adding that the investigative effort had taken
six hours.
   State police had said four workers at a fast food restaurant in
Cross Lanes, 11 miles west of Charleston and about 170 miles south
of the prison, had made a positive identification of the escapees
based on mug shots.
   Convicted murderers Bobby Stacy, Tommie Mollohan and David
Williams used stolen bolt cutters in their Sunday night escape from
the Moundsville prison.
   Earlier, a prison official blamed the escape on antiquated
facilities and the need to use inmate labor.
   Corrections Commissioner A.V. Dodrill said at least one of the
escapees was probably familiar with ``every nook and cranny'' of
the 122-year-old prison, which Dodrill says can be kept running
only with the help of the inmates.
   As a result, he said, inmates often become familiar with the
institution's weaknesses.
   ``This prison is in terrible shape. The plumbing is especially
bad. It needs constant renovation,'' Dodrill said.
   Mollohan, 45, was convicted of robbing and killing a grocer in
1973.
   At the time, Mollohan had escaped from a Florida prison and also
was wanted in Georgia and North Carolina on armed robbery charges.
   ``Mollohan was the ringleader,'' Dodrill said. ``He is an
excellent plumber and probably knew every nook and cranny.''
   Stacy, 35, was convicted of killing one police officer and
accused of shooting another. Authorities said he had sworn revenge
on those who had put him behind bars.
   Police have assigned protection to those who helped convict
Stacy, including the judge in his case and a Columbus, Ohio, woman
who testified against him.
   Williams, 28, was serving a life sentence for felony murder,
arson and robbery. Dodrill said authorities are trying to determine
whether the three were aided in their escape by correctional
officers. ``That possibility does exist,'' the commissioner said.
   The last escape from Moundsville was in February 1983, when two
inmates climbed over a wall behind the prison. They were recaptured
within 24 hours.
   In 1979, 15 inmates, including convicted cop killer Ronald
Williams, escaped from the massive, stone block prison, killing an
off-duty state trooper who was driving past. All 15 eventually were
recaptured.

<NOTE>Eds: New grafs 1-8 UPDATE with Gorbachev comments. Pick up 6th

<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda on Tuesday
denounced Soviets who are nostalgic for dictator Josef Stalin's
rule and say Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms are damaging socialism.
   Pravda also lashed out at publications that praise Stalinism and
said Gorbachev's ``glasnost'' policy of more openness on some
issues does not include criticizing principles of the economic
reforms the Soviet leader calls ``perestroika.''
   ``We need disputes helping to advance perestroika and leading to
the consolidation of forces and cohesion around perestroika rather
than to disunity,'' Pravda said in a full-page, unsigned editorial.
   It said the Soviet Union needs people dedicated to improving
housing, food supplies and services rather than those obsessed with
uncovering suspected enemies of socialism.
   ``A patriot is not he who cries out loudly about an alleged
`internal threat' to socialism, who, joining with a few political
extremists, seeks internal enemies everywhere,'' Pravda said. ``A
patriot is he who acts in the interest of the country, of the
people, without fear of any difficulty.''
   In a Kremlin meeting Tuesday with Willy Brandt, the head of
Socialist International and former chancellor of West Germany,
Gorbachev acknowledged that his reforms have generated controversy.
   The official Tass news agency quoted Gorbachev, general
secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, as saying, ``There are
people who think everything is collapsing. Just as in the beginning
of this century `matter vanished' in the perceptions of some people
as a result of new discoveries in physics, now it seems to some
that socialism is vanishing.''
   Gorbachev said that what is really happening is that socialism
``is ridding itself of everything that had deformed it in the past
and is demonstrating tremendous dynamism, the wealth of its social
and humanistic content.''
   Pravda's editors said they felt compelled to address the issue
of Stalinism because another newspaper had raised it improperly.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya, official daily of the Russian republic's
party and government, carried a letter from a Leningrad teacher who
defended Stalin. It was published March 13, just before Gorbachev
left for Yugoslavia and his chief of propaganda, Alexander N.
Yavovlev, went to Mongolia.
   In the past year, Soviet publications have criticized the
excesses of Stalin, who ruled for three decades and died in 1953.
   Gorbachev said in November the dictator's guilt for the purges
in which millions died was ``enormous and unforgivable,'' but
defended Stalin's policies of rapid industrialization and
collectivizating of agriculture.
   The Pravda editorial appeared to be an attempt to draw the party
line on Stalinism.
   It repeated criticisms of Stalin but said Gorbachev's opponents
won't let the issue rest, either because they feel more comfortable
with Stalin's repression or because it would serve their own
interests.
   ``In one person this may be directed at taking more and giving
less, in another in wrapping in respectable clothes their efforts
to claim a monopoly in science, personal innocence or something
else,'' the paper said.
   Pravda criticized the system under Stalin as ``thoughtless
execution of orders and suppression of initiative.'' The Soviet
Union cannot hide from the fact that ``many thousands'' of party
workers, economic and military officials, scientists and cultural
figures were exiled or killed, it said.
   Gorbachev launched his effort to restructure Soviet society
three years ago, and Pravda said there are those who feel
widespread changes could undermine the Soviet system.
   ``Not all realize fully that the administrative-command methods
have exhausted themselves,'' it said. ``All who pin hopes on those
methods or their modifications would do well to wake up to the fact
that we have had that more than once, but it did not bring about
the desired results.''
   People should ``get rid of the nostalgia for the past, when some
people said things and others were supposed to heed and
uncomplainingly fulfill the orders,'' Pravda advised.
   It said statements in the letter published by Sovietskaya
Rossiya are ``an attempt, little by little, to revise party
decisions.''
   ``At meetings at the party Central Committee it has been said
more than once that the Soviet press is not a private shop and that
the Communists writing in the press and the editors should be aware
of their responsibility for the articles and the publications,'' it
declared.
   ``In this case the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya, which has .. .
done much for perestroika, has departed from this principle.''

   A middle school music instructor was singing
a sweet tune Tuesday after finding the right measures for a chair
to fit Sandy Allen, the world's tallest woman.
   The chair was one of many gifts the 7-foot-7\ Allen received at
a party in her honor.
   ``It is our way of showing appreciation for the way she faced
challenges to make something of her life,'' said Cynthia Prime, a
longtime friend of Allen's who coordinated the ``High on Life''
party.
   Allen, 32, is recognized as the world's tallest woman by the
Guinness Book of World Records.
   More than 150 groups and people became involved in the project
to honor Allen. The $8,500 in gifts included clothing, a quilt and
a leather handbag.
   Frank Penwell estimated he spent 20 hours building the wooden,
upholstered chair, which Allen sat on for the first time Tuesday.
   ``I decided to make the chair when my wife became involved in
the project and we realized that Sandy had special needs besides
clothing,'' he said. ``Designing furniture is my hobby.
   ``I knew how tall Sandy was and I estimated what size the chair
should be,'' he said. ``The top of the chair is 56 inches high and
the seat is 24 inches wide. The seat is 28 inches off the ground
and 28 inches deep.''
   Allen said the chair was very comfortable.
   ``This day is just incredible. I can't believe how much this
thing snowballed,'' Allen said. ``It's nice to know that there are
people here who think so much about me.''
   The gifts are the latest in a series of special events for
Allen, who decided to leave her job last year at a Canadian museum
and return to Indiana. She once lived in Shelbyville, southeast of
Indianapolis.
   She started work in February as a secretary-receptionist in
Mayor William H. Hudnut's office.
   ``When I heard she types 93 words per minute, I decided we
should get her,'' Elena Leigh-Cohen, Allen's supervisor, said.
``We've had to make some adjustments in the office, like raising
her desk, and we're going to have a special chair made.''

   A 16-year-old boy on Tuesday pleaded guilty
as an adult to second-degree murder in the death of an 86-year-old
man during a robbery for a jar of pennies.
   Matthew Schrom of Austin, one of two 16-year-olds accused of
fatally stabbing Michael Linard Fink in January, entered the plea
in Mower County District Court.
   Attorneys for both sides presented Judge Paul Kimball with a
proposal under which Schrom, who was charged with first-degree
murder in juvenile court, would plead guilty to second-degree
murder in adult court.
   The other teen-ager, charged in juvenile court with first-degree
murder, remains in custody in lieu of $100,000 bond. A hearing is
scheduled next week, but County Attorney Nancy Evans has said she
does not expect a plea agreement in his case.
   Sheriff Don Hoffman has said the boys took a few dollars in
pennies from Fink's home. The boys knew Fink and were invited into
his home, the sheriff said.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feuding Moslems and Christians joined in
a nationwide strike Tuesday to demand 300 percent wage increases to
counter inflation and the economic chaos brought on by 13 years of
civil war.
   In southern Lebanon, rival Moslem factions engaged in a gun
battle that left one man killed and four wounded.
   Police said the fight near the town of Nabatiyeh was between the
Syrian-backed Shiite Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Shiite
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   They said Amal militiamen had raided several villages and
rounded up 10 Hezbollah members in a search for gunmen who fired at
the car of Amal's militia commander in Nabatiyeh, Mahmoud Faqih, on
Monday. Police said Faqih was not in the car at the time.
   The one-day general strike was the latest in a series of
demonstrations that began nearly two years ago to protest the
economic situation.
   Banks, schools, shops, gasoline stations, government offices and
other businesses closed in both Christian east Beirut and Moslem
west Beirut and cities and towns throughout the country.
   But some Lebanese were sceptical.
   ``We've tried this before and nothing happened,'' said Adel
Bohsali, an employee at a pastry shop in west Beirut.
   The General Confederation of Labor Unions, which claims 300,000
members, said Beirut airport, hospitals, pharmacies, bakeries and
newspapers were exempt from the strike.
   In 1975, when the civil war began, the annual inflation rate was
9 percent. It is now 225 percent.
   The Lebanese pound, once the soundest currency in the Middle
East, exchanged at 2.5 to the U.S. dollar before the civil war and
the rate last week was 360 per dollar.
   The pound's collapse sent prices soaring in a country that
imports more than 85 percent of its needs.
   In its strike call, the labor confederatin said Tuesday's action
was a warning and an indefinite work stoppage would begin April 15
if the demand for the 300 percent increase, retroactive to January,
was not met.
   A government source, speaking with the condition he not be
identified, said Cabinet ministers were considering a compromise
that would approve wage increases but they would be limited to 100
percent.

<HEAD>Official Denies China Reducing Number Of Overseas Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An education official on Tuesday denied reports
that China will drastically reduce the number of students it allows
to study overseas, especially in the United States.
   Huang Xinbai, a member of the State Education Commission who is
in charge of Chinese students abroad, called the reports
groundless, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   It quoted Huang as saying China has a long-standing policy of
sending students abroad and the policy had not changed and ``will
never change.'' He said the numbers of both state-financed and
privately financed students were expected to stay the same.
   According to Huang, the government has sent about 3,000 students
abroad each year since 1980.
   The number sent by their employers or by academic institutions
has increased steadily and in 1987 topped 5,000, he said.
   Huang estimated that an additional 3,000 students are financing
their own overseas education.
   Since China began sending students overseas in 1979 as part of
its general opening to the outside world, more than 40,000
state-funded students have gone to study in 70 countries, Huang
said according to Xinhua.
   China last summer announced new regulations tightening controls
on students going abroad and said they must be ``ideologically and
morally sound.'' Many of the students have not returned home
because of better jobs and living conditions overseas.
   Huang said 20,000 students have completed their studies abroad
and returned to China.
   Of the other 20,000 state-funded students still overseas, 10,000
are studying in the United States, he said.
   News reports said the United States has 27,000 Chinese students,
10,000 paying their own way and 7,000 on scholarships.
   Some students who returned from abroad have said their skills
and knowledge are not put to full use in China, and they have
trouble readjusting to China's rigid political and social norms.
   Recent Western news reports said China changed its overseas
study policy, cutting the number of students going abroad to 3,000.
   Some reports said only 600 new students would be allowed to go
to the United States because China was concerned that students were
becoming too Americanized and were bringing back capitalist and
bourgeois attitudes.
   ``It is utterly groundless to say that the numbers of students
to be sent abroad, particularly those sent to the United States,
shall be cut substantially,'' Huang said.
   He said 4,600 state-funded students would be sent to the United
States this year.
   But Xinhua reported Huang said some adjustments were made in
China's study-abroad program.
   Under the new guidelines, students in applied fields of study
are more likely to be sent overseas, and more students will be sent
to countries where there are few Chinese students already studying.
   China also will cut back the number of undergraduate and
graduate students going overseas and send abroad more scholars
engaged in advanced research, Huang said.

   Police using helicopters raided
Tuesday the luxurious home of a Honduran wanted on drug trafficking
charges and then turned him over to U.S. custody, his lawyer and
American officials said.
   Authorities did not give details of the predawn arrest of Juan
Ramon Matta, 43. He has lived openly in Honduras since escaping in
1986 from a Colombian prison, where he was held on charges of
involvement with the notorious Medellin drug cartel.
   ``This arrest is a major milestone in our worldwide assault on
illegal drug trafficking,'' said Stanley E. Morris, director of the
U.S. Marshals Service in Washington.
   Honduran government sources said privately that President Jose
Azcona Hoyo met with top civilian and security officials to discuss
the case of Matta, who is wanted in the United States on drug
charges.
   The U.S. Marshals Service announced in Washington late Tuesday
that Matta had been taken into U.S. custody.
   Spokesman Stephen Boyle said Matta was at an undisclosed
location ``in U.S. jurisdiction'' and would be taken to a federal
prison in the United States ``before dawn (Wednesday).''
   Morris said Matta ``was placed on a commercial airliner destined
for the United States at approximately 7 p.m. EDT.''
   A U.S. law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said authorities also want to question him about the
death of Enrique Camarena Salazar, a U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent who was kidnapped, tortured and killed in
Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1985.
   The Marshals Service said Matta is believed to have become a
leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of
illegal drugs from Mexico.
   Carlos Lorenzana, Matta's lawyer, said in a telephone interview
about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at his
client's home at 5:45 a.m.
   He claimed Matta, as a Honduran citizen, could not be extradited
to the United States ``because the constitution forbids it.''
   Asked later Tuesday about Matta being in U.S. custody, the
lawyer said: ``I don't know anything yet, but if Matta is found in
the United States that's a kidnapping, not an extradition, because
he is a Honduran and protected by the political constitution.''
   A source at the U.S. Embassy, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said extradition was legal and ``our government
maintains its position of taking Matta to our country, where he
will face trial in five courts for drug trafficking.''
   Lorenzana said Matta was taken to a special police facility at
La Venta, 12 miles east of the capital.
   U.S. authorities link Matta's return to Honduras to an increase
in transshipment of Colombian cocaine through this Central American
country.
   Allegations have been made of involvement by top Honduran
military officials.
   The government denied the reports in February. Azcona said
critics were trying ``to discredit the armed forces and my
government, which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug
traffickers.''
   Matta told The Associated Press in February he makes his living
in cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, spice and coffee
trade. His wealth has been estimated at up to $2 billion, but he
puts it at about $5 million.
   He said the charges against him were ``a lie, a story,'' and
claimed U.S. agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap
him.
   Matta said then he never again would leave Honduras. ``If I
appear in the United States, it is a kidnapping by American agents.
If I am killed, it is the DEA,'' he said at the time.
   It apppeared that after fleeing Colombia he went to the
Dominican Republic but was expelled after officials determined he
was wanted in the United States.
   The Marshals Service said this expulsion was based on a U.S.
warrant for Matta after he escaped from Elgin Federal Prison Camp
in Florida in 1971. He was serving a five-year sentence for
illegally entering the United States and using a fraudulent visa.
   Warrants charge him with escape from federal custody, conspiracy
to smuggle cocaine, possession with intent to distribute coccaine,
engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other charges.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson narrowly lost the votes
of Wisconsin's blue collar workers to Michael Dukakis and attracted
only a quarter of the white vote, exit polls said.
   Jackson drew huge crowds at strike sites and hard-pressed
manufacturing communities in Wisconsin, but that enthusiasm did not
translate into primary votes. Dukakis beat Jackson solidly among
white blue collar workers and edged him in that category with
blacks included, ABC News and NBC said.
   Dukakis won 41 percent of blue collar Democratic voters, ABC
said, to Jackson's 37 percent. Among white blue-collar voters only,
Dukakis had 47 percent, Jackson 27 percent. NBC's numbers were
similar, with 43 percent of the overall blue collar vote going for
Dukakis and 37 percent for Jackson.
   As in previous contests, the black vote went overwhelmingly for
Jackson. Among whites, ABC and CBS said Jackson won 23 percent
support while NBC put the figure slightly higher at 28 percent.
   Jackson won just 7 percent of the white vote in Wisconsin in
1984. ABC polls said he won 22 percent in Connecticut last week and
32 percent in liberal Vermont on March 1. Said ABC poll analyst
Doug Muzzio: ``We may be looking at his ceiling here.''
   ``We're seeing a dual electorate: a black electorate and a white
electorate,'' Muzzio said. ``Jackson does extremely well among
blacks and Dukakis does substantially well among whites.''
   Electability may have been an issue, with two-thirds of all
Democrats saying they think Dukakis will be the presidential
nominee, NBC News found. Even four in 10 Jackson voters expected
Dukakis to win the nomination.
   While support for Dukakis was spread widely among demographic
groups, CBS News poll analyst Pama Mitchell said ``it looks to me
from our numbers that Dukakis' support is softer'' than Jackson's
or Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s.
   The CBS-Times poll found that Dukakis supporters were split
evenly between those who backed him strongly and those who liked
him ``with reservations,'' while Jackson's strong supporters far
outnumbered his weak ones.
   In another measure, NBC said four in 10 Dukakis supporters
wished other candidates were in the race. Nonetheless, more than
six in 10 Wisconsin Democrats said he would be the strongest
nominee of the current candidates.
   Dukakis also scored well in the goodwill category. The CBS-Times
poll said 74 percent of Democrats expressed a favorable view of
Dukakis, with 22 percent unfavorable. Jackson was rated favorably
by 55 percent and unfavorably by 40 percent.
   ``It isn't that Jackson isn't liked,'' said Kathleen A.
Frankovic, a CBS pollster. ``It's just that Dukakis is liked
better.''
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois had the greatest unfavorable rating,
more than five in 10, and a favorable rating of about four in 10.
Gore was viewed favorably by better than five in 10 but unfavorably
by about four in 10.
   The ABC and the CBS-Times polls found no evidence of a movement
by Republicans to cross over into the Democratic primary and vote
for Jackson as the Democrat most likely to lose to George Bush. The
CBS-Times poll found that of the 14 percent of Democratic voters
who said they were Republicans, 42 percent voted for Dukakis, 28
percent for Gore and 20 percent for Jackson.
   The exit polls all had a margin of sampling error of about 3
points.

   The 328 passengers on a stranded Amtrak
train were treated to West Texas hospitality and a barbecue Tuesday
after a freight-train derailment kept them in this tiny town for
more than 10 hours.
   The Sunset Limited, which runs from New Orleans to Los Angeles,
was stopped at Sanderson about 10:30 a.m. CDT Tuesday when a
Southern Pacific freight train derailed ahead of it, said Debbie
Marciniak, a spokeswoman for Amtrak in Chicago.
   ``We could have detoured, but we found it would take a minimum
of 13 to 14 hours,'' Ms. Marciniak said.
   So Amtrak contacted officials in the town of 1,200 people to
arrange accommodations for the 328 passengers and 18 crew _
including an impromptu mass-buffet barbecue for dinner.
   ``We started working on it about 11:30 a.m. _ just as soon as
they called,'' said John Sandifer, who operates Kountry Kitchen
with his wife, Jeanie.
   ``Everybody was real pleased since Amtrak was paying for it.
Everyone I talked to was in a real good mood,'' he said. By 7 p.m.,
the last of the barbecue brisket, sausage, hamburgers, hot dogs,
baked beans and potato salad had been eaten, he said.
   ``We just barely made it,'' he said. ``We did up about 125
pounds of potato salad. They've cleaned us out,'' he said,
referring to the passengers who reboarded the train after a 10-hour
wait.
   Meantime, the local historical society offered passengers brief
tours of town, children were taken to a park to play and the movie
``La Bamba'' was available in the train's theater.
   Sanderson, about 120 miles west of Del Rio and about 180 miles
south of San Angelo, has about 1,200 residents.

<HEAD>Opposition Paper Suspends Publication, Has No Newsprint</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   La Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition
newspaper, suspended publication indefinitely Tuesday saying the
Sandinista government had not provided newsprint.
   A front-page story said ``with this edition we exhaust our
supply of paper, so we will not be able to circulate as long as the
Sandinista government, the only supplier, doesn't sell us paper.''
   Anti-Sandinista rebels have charged that the government, by not
providing newsprint, violated a recent promise to allow a free
press.
   Tuesday's La Prensa article rejected government suggestions that
La Prensa ran out of newsprint because of mismanagement of its
limited supply, saying publishers had reduced the daily's size from
12 to 8 pages and taken other steps to conserve.
   Deputy publisher Cristiana Chamorro said earlier Tuesday:
   ``We have no paper to come out tomorrow, or on the following
days, because the government claims there is no newsprint in the
country, but we know there is.''
   In a telephone interview, she noted the country's two other
daily newspapers, the official Sandinista publication Barricada and
pro-government Nuevo Diario, ``have been coming out normally with
eight full pages.'' Barricada and Nuevo Diario are morning papers
and La Prensa is an afternoon daily.
   The Ministry of Industry said in a statement it could not solve
La Prensa's problem because a shipment of newsprint scheduled to
arrive in March had not reached Nicaragua. It said the government
is not expecting another shipment until April 17.
   ``Once this shipment is received the Ministry of Industry will
proceed to distribute paper proportionally, according to the
established mechanisms,'' the statement said.
   It added that the government had advised the three newspapers to
take precautions against using up their stockpiles of newsprint. La
Prensa last published on April 29, then announced it would take its
traditional Holy Week break.
   Nicaragua does not manufacture newsprint, and the leftist
government controls imports and distribution.
   La Prensa was shut down from June 1986 until last Oct. 1,
reopening as part of the government's efforts to comply with a
regional Central American peace plan.
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a rebel leader, told a news conference
in Miami Tuesday that the Sandinistas should supply La Prensa with
newsprint under a cease-fire agreement reached last month by the
rebels and government.
   He is a brother of Christiani Chamorro and was a co-publisher of
La Prensa until going into exile to join the rebels, known as
Contras.
   ``The government originally informed us that an agency of the
Interior Ministry could supply us with 70 rolls, enough for one
week, but at the last moment they told us the newsprint wasn't
there anymore,'' Ms. Chamorro said. ``We have taken steps to find
out if they can provide us with paper and we will know tomorrow if
we will be coming out, after midday.''
   She said the government told La Prensa it was expecting some
newsprint to arrive on a Soviet freighter April 17.
   The Soviet Union and Cuba provide the Sandinistas with military
equipment, food and other supplies.
   A letter from Defense Minister Humberto Ortega to rebel leader
Adolfo Calero said, ``It is clear that in Nicaragua there exists
total and unrestricted freedom of expression for any political
group of sector of the population.
   ``The problem of the lack of paper that is an editorial business
is not the responsibility of the government.''

   Evan Mecham was convicted on impeachment
charges and removed as governor in a finale to 15 months of
national ridicule that began the week the political outsider took
office.
   ``I feel relieved that this nightmare is over,'' Republican Sen.
Greg Lunn said Monday after Mecham, a first-term Republican, became
the first U.S. governor in 59 years to be impeached and stripped of
his office.
   Mecham, 63, showed no emotion as the Arizona Senate voted 21-9
to convict him of trying to obstruct an investigation of a alleged
death threat and 26-4 of misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund. Twenty votes were required for conviction.

certainties is his role as defendant in a criminal trial.
   But for Arizona, the future looks brighter without the shadow of
Mecham's embarrassing impeachment trial hanging over the state,
said Rose Mofford, who became governor with Mecham's removal.
   ``Today we have reached the end of some difficult times in
Arizona,'' Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, said Monday. ``I know the
decision made by the Senate today was not reached lightly. It is
time to put all that behind us and move forward.''

   Most U.S. students remain computer illiterates
and few schools use computers effectively to teach basics despite a
much-heralded ``classroom computer revolution,'' according to a
survey released today.
   The study of 24,000 third-, seventh- and 11th graders found that
access to computers is too limited at school and at home, school
curricula haven't changed to make effective use of computers and
teachers are inadequately trained.
   ``Computer Competence: The First National Assessment,'' by the
National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also found that
white students scored 5 percent to 8 percent higher on average than
blacks and Hispanics, mainly due to greater access to computers at

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Tuesday
announced replacements for the No. 2 and No. 3 positions in the
Justice Department, but was unable to fill the post vacated by last
week's protest resignation of Assistant Attorney General William
Weld.
   Meese said he would recommend John C. Shepherd, a past president
of the American Bar Association, and Francis A. Keating II, a top
Treasury Department law enforcement official, for the two top-level
Justice Department posts.
   Shepherd would replace Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns.
Burn resigned a week ago along with Weld, then head of the criminal
division, out of concern that the nearly 11-month criminal
investigation of Meese by independent counsel James C. McKay was
hurting the Justice Department operations and its image, department
sources said.

   America's population is older than ever, with
maturing Baby Boomers and the growing number of elderly pulling the
median age past 32 years for the first time, new Census Bureau
figures showed Tuesday.
   ``The `Graying of America' is ... documented by its increasing
age. The median age was 32.1 years on July 1, 1987,'' bureau
statistician Louisa Miller reported.
   Rising from 31.8 in 1986, it was the highest median age in U.S.
history. Median is the point at which half of all Americans are
older than that age and half younger.
   The national median rose with the help of several factors,
including the growing number of elderly Americans, the maturing of
the post-World War II Baby Boom and the small ``Baby Bust''
generation that followed.

   Americans are enjoying a rare combination of
fairly robust growth and slowly rising prices, and a recent uptick
in interest rates is no cause for alarm, economists said Tuesday.
   Interest rates rise when lenders become fearful of inflation,
but so far inflation remains under control despite surprisingly
strong economic growth. Consumer prices are rising at an annual
rate of 4 percent to 4.5 percent, roughly as they have for three
years.
   Interest rates fell after the Oct. 19 stock market panic because
investors felt the crash might trigger a recession and wipe out
inflation.

   The government plans to hire undercover
courtesy agents to root out rudeness among civil servants.
   The latest twist in a 10-year campaign to make Singaporeans mind
their manners will see private investigators snooping at counters
in government buildings where the public is served.
   Seven research and public relations agencies have bid for a
contract to measure courtesy in the civil service, said Richard
Tan, deputy director of the Psychological Defense Division of the
Ministry of Communications and Information.
   A private company is sought for the job to ``ensure objectivity
in the exercise,'' Tan told The Straits Times newspaper.
   The courtesy ``audit'' is not a witch hunt to pinpoint
individuals, he said. Its purpose is to investigate causes of
rudeness and see what can be done to correct them.
   ``Systems which don't allow people to be flexible can affect
their behavior or cause others to think they are rude.'' Tan said.
   The first part of the survey will attempt to rank government
ministries and statutory bodies in terms of their impact on
peoples's lives.
   ``Civil servants work under constraints,'' Tan said. ``Customers
may demand that they bypass the system and when they don't, it
comes across as rudeness.'' The check on government workers who
deal with the public is in addition to the annual nationwide
courtesy drive. Banners and signs, a ``courtesy hotline,''
television announcements and lapel badges appear each July to drive
the message home.
   ``Courtesy: It Makes Life Better,'' is the slogan for 1988.
   The courtesy campaign is only one of a long series of official
efforts to raise civic consciousness in Singapore. Unlike most of
the others, such as the anti-littering and don't jaywalk drives,
the discourteous are not threatened with fines.
   Public concern about rudeness started in 1978 when the Tourist
Promotion Board urged those who dealt with visitors to be polite so
they would spend more. ``Courtesy Is Our Way Of Life,'' was the
original slogan.
   ``Make Courtesy Our Way Of Life'' was adopted the following
year, when Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew got involved in national
etiquette.
   ``To be courteous to free-spending tourists and to be rude to
fellow Singaporeans is to demean ourselves,'' he said. ``Then we
become a despicable people, moved only by the thought of profit.''
   Lee set 1990 as the deadline to ``file down the ragged corners
of our social behavior which can grate on each other.''
   The year 1990 was chosen because by then more than 75 percent of
the city-state's 2.6 million people will be living in
government-built apartments.
   Lee said neighbors would likely be lifelong ones and everone
would have a stake in smooth relations.
   Courtesy campaigners confirm that much remains to be done to
polish what is called ``social responsibility'' for public housing,
parks and toilets.
   Many apartment blocks have become high-rise slums with elevators
reeking of urine and corridors filled with trash.
   The elevator problem is so bad that the Housing Board installed
a sophisticated monitoring system in three buildings.
   Sensors activated by the high salt content in urine stop the
elevator, activate a video camera in the ceiling and alert the
janitor. Officials said five male culprits, aged 7 to 79, have been
caught so far this year.
   ``Singaporeans may not be the most discourteous people on Earth
but they are certainly nowhere near the top 10 when it comes to
courtesy,'' said then-Second Deputy Prime Minister Sinnathamby
Rajaratnam when he inaugurated the 1983 campaign.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto, political foe of
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, is still queen of Pakistan's
political opposition, but she reigns over a party in disarray.
   The Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which she inherited from her
late father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, has been racked in
recent months by political infighting, an ideological shift and a
poor showing in local elections.
   Nevertheless, Ms. Bhutto says she is determined to pull her
grass-roots movement back together for national elections scheduled
for 1990 in which she could face Zia head-on. Zia has indicated he
will run.
   Millions turned out in April 1986 when Ms. Bhutto, now 34,
returned from two years of voluntary exile in London. The adoring
masses likened her to the Philippines' Corazon Aquino who would
ride to office on a wave of ``people power.''
   Two years later, however, Ms. Bhutto's critics say her policies
are hard to discern from those of the Zia government. They call her
leadership autocratic, her lifestyle patrician, and claim her
overtures toward the United States run counter to the PPP's
traditions.
   Zia overthrew her father in a 1977 military coup. Bhutto later
was convicted of complicity in the killing of a political opponent
and he was hanged in 1979.
   Zia, an army general and chief of the army staff, ruled by
martial law until the end of 1985, when a civilian government was
voted into office in an election that barred political parties. Zia
retained the presidency.
   Since then, Zia and his prime minister, Mohammad Khan Junejo,
have restored a number of fundamental civil rights and lifted most
censorship of the press.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Ms. Bhutto attributed
the recent criticism of her to the government.
   ``In the first years of overmilitary rule, the name of the
Bhutto family was not allowed to appear in the press,'' she said.
   ``The new target, since the last two years, is to flood
newspapers with stories on Benazir and flood them with distorted
stories attacking my capabilities, attacking my leadership.''
   But many of her critics are current and former PPP members.
   ``Ms. Bhutto is a complete mistress unto herself, seldom
considering it necessary to consult the (party's) Central Committee
on major issues,'' wrote PPP member Ayaz Amir in The Herald, a
Pakistani magazine.
   The critics say the PPP is still a party of the Bhutto family,
built around the charisma of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and perpetuated by
what followers view as his martyrdom.
   Ms. Bhutto takes more seriously the criticism of her changing
policies, especially her pro-Americanism and her shift away from
her father's socialist ideals.
   ``Pakistan is in a period of transition,'' she said. ``We don't
have a direct military rule; we have an indirect military rule, or
we have the iron fist in the velvet glove. In this new situation
the party and the party workers must also make the mental
transition and the necessary adjustments that come from conforming
to the new circumstances.''
   She said her warming toward the United States, which she once
accused of helping cause her father's downfall, is a pragmatic
recognition of Washington's role in the region.
   ``It is a country that gives tremendous economic and military
aid to Pakistan. One cannot ignore that reality.''
   Along with the United States and Zia's government, her party
supports the Moslem resistance against the Soviet-backed government
in neighboring Afghanistan.
   As for her economic policies, which are described as moderate,
Ms. Bhutto said she has deviated no more from the PPP's founding
principles than her father did.
   ``This is nothing new. They (the left wing) would like to
transform the PPP, which is a populist, social-democratic party in
the Moslem context, into a Marxist party,'' she said. ``We may not
agree, but (we) respect them for having their views and expect them
to respect our views.''
   Upon her triumphal return to Pakistan in 1986, Ms. Bhutto called
for elections within months but the demand was not met. She then
called for mass protests on July 5 of that year, the anniversary of
Zia's coup, and the turnout was far less than expected.
   The following month, she and 400 opposition leaders were
arrested for defying a government ban on rallies.
   She was released, but her problems were compounded this past
November when her party won only 20 percent of some 75,000 seats at
stake in local elections.
   Although candidates officially were banned from declaring their
party affiliations in the election, those of Junejo's Pakistan
Muslim League campaigned openly.
   The deafeat led to a series of firings and resignations within
the PPP.
   In December, Ms. Bhutto was back in the limelight with her
much-publicized marriage, arranged in the Islamic tradition, to a
Karachi businessman. This year she has been making a series of
barnstorming trips into the Pakistani hinterlands.
   She also has managed to rally her party around a new cause: the
fate of about 400 Pakistanis still in prison for violations of
martial law in 1977-85.
   Although Prime Minister Junejo has promised to review some of
the cases, a constitutional amendment at the time of the
restoration of civilian rule blocks the judicial review of
decisions made during martial law.

<HEAD>The Rev. James Cleveland Featured on Rousing ``Family Reunion'' on

<TEXT>
   Be thankful for the low spots and the dull
narration in ``Family Reunion _ A Gospel Music Celebration.''
   Without the low points, the voltage from this musical blowout
might leave viewers writhing on the floor. Television sets might
explode and fires break out across the land.
   ``Family Reunion,'' appearing Saturday on the CBN Cable Network,
offers two hours of hits from some of the biggest names in gospel
music, including the Rev. James Cleveland, the Clark Sisters,
Andrae Crouch, Sandra Crouch, Jessy Dixon, Edwin Hawkins, Thelma
Houston, Billy Preston, Bebe and Cece Winans, and The Mighty Clouds
of Joy.
   What's wrong with the packaging can be summed up in two words:
Dick Clark.
   The ageless record-spinner, planted beside a fireplace, has
little to say about the history or the meaning of gospel music. His
role seems to be to assure the uninitiated that it's OK to listen,
because the Beatles did, too.
   He might have said more about the history of gospel, because a
lot is implied by the songs and the singers. ``Precious Lord,''
sung here by Della Reese, was written in 1931 by Thomas A. Dorsey,
the man who invented gospel.
   Cleveland was a boy soprano in Dorsey's choir at the Pilgrim
Baptist Church in Chicago. In the 1960s, as the ``crown prince of
gospel,'' Cleveland worked with such young people as Billy Preston,
Jessy Dixon and Aretha Franklin.
   Dixon hits one of the program's high points with a bluesy
rendition of Professor Alex Bradford's ``I'm Too Close to Heaven
(and I Can't Turn Around).''
   Cleveland, whose growling voice and dabbing handkerchief recall
Louis Armstrong, comes up next and steals the show with ``Peace, Be
Still.''
   The song was a huge hit in gospel terms, selling 800,000 albums
in the 1960s. It's a dramatic piece in which Cleveland sweats,
shouts, sings and preaches, turning down the volume with a
peremptory ``shhh!'' and then building to another plateau.
   ``Family Reunion'' covers some of the same territory covered
last year with Paul Simon in the Cinemax special, ``Everybody Say
Yeah!'' Andrae Crouch, Jennifer Holliday, the Hawkins Singers and
the Mighty Clouds of Joy appeared on both shows.
   There's even the same quotation from James Baldwin _ ``there is
no music like that music'' _ which, if you think about it, applies
to Lawrence Welk and a lot of other styles, too. But you get the
point.
   High follows high, sometiomes in unexpected places. Hawkins'
familiar hit, ``Oh Happy Day,'' is given some needed rough edges by
the fiery, strutting solo work of Thelma Houston.
   Tramaine Hawkins _ wife of Edwin's brother, Walter _ lights up
the place with ``Changed.''
   Finally, the Crouch who wrecks the house isn't Andrae, but his
sister, Sandra. This regal lady, a hard-working choir director
through much of the show, takes the solo part as she whips a
quartet and chorus through a rousing performance of ``He's Worthy.''
   Amid all the stars, the show's last high point is hit by an
unidentified young woman who steps out of the choir in ``He's
Worthy,'' and she's ready.
   Not only has she picked up a couple of microphone moves from Joe
Ligon of the Mighty Clouds, but she has a huge voice that lifts the
roof. It bodes well for the future of gospel.

   Susan and Ted Blew are having fun
these days growing vegetables on their 160-acre farm, making some
money and raising three children in wide open spaces only 45
minutes from the smokestacks of industrial Newark.
   Things weren't always so good.
   For five years, they struggled, saddled with a six-figure
mortgage and a floating interest rate that reached 16 percent.
   Theirs was a Catch-22 situation. To make more money to pay the
mortgage, the Blews rented 1,000 more acres and grew wholesale
grain. They considered it drudgery, and, worse, the new loans only
added to their debt.
   Then, about two years ago, they found a way to pay off their
mortgage, keep their Hunterdon County farm for their children and
make money growing what they wanted: They sold development rights
to their land to the state of New Jersey as part of a farm land
preservation program.
   More and more state and local governments are giving top
priority _ and tens of millions of dollars _ to farm land
preservation programs, efforts to save rapidly vanishing open space
from developers. The trend is spreading from the Northeast, where
it started, to the South and West.
   The government assesses the land's value for farming and
compares that to its higher worth for housing or commercial use,
such as a mall. The farmer is offered the difference in dollars in
return for an agreement that the land can never be sold for
development. The farmer keeps the property and can still sell it,
but its deed will be restricted to farming or open space use.
   The Blews received almost $900 an acre or $143,500 from the
state and county, which split the cost. That same day, Dec. 19,
1985, they turned the check over to the bank, paying off their
mortgage, on which they had been making payments of close to
$10,000 every six months, and an outstanding business loan.
   ``We had $10 (left) to go to lunch,'' Ted said. They celebrated
at a Ponderosa restaurant with steaks and chocolate milk. ``It came
to $10.12,'' said Susan, smiling.
   The Blews can afford to smile now. The pressure is off.
   ``It relieved the pressure of that exploding interest rate,''
Ted said. ``You enjoy working when you're making some money, when
you're able to pay your bills and have something left over.''
   New Jersey's share of the money came from a $50 million bond
issue voters approved in 1981.
   Other states with similar farm land and open space preservation
programs include Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.
   Local programs exist in Boulder County, Colo.; Forsyth and
Mecklenburg counties in North Carolina, whose respective seats are
Winston-Salem and Charlotte; King County, Wash., around Seattle;
and Northern California's Marin and Solano counties. In Collin
County, Texas, north of Dallas, officials are trying to raise funds
for land preservation.
   Over the last decade, almost 100,000 acres of working farm land
have been saved, said Jim Riggle, director of field operations for
American Farmland Trust in Washington, D.C., a non-profit
organization that works to conserve agriculture.
   The success of preservation programs, however, doesn't mean
development is being slowed.
   Riggle estimated that since World War II, some 70 million to 100
million acres of U.S. agricultural land has been converted to
commercial or residential use, or has been used for highway or
other public works projects. That leaves no more than 1.2 billion
acres of privately owned open land nationwide, of which 575 million
are being farmed or have a high potential for farming, while the
rest remains unused for crops because of its lesser quality.
   Roughly 3 million acres of farm land are being lost every year,
he said.
   ``Six out of 10 of the most productive agricultural counties are
either already classified in metropolitan areas or adjacent to
them,'' he said. ``That's where the action is taking place. There
is a general degrading of the quality of our land in this country.''
   Development pressure in Massachusetts remains strong even though
the state has already spent $45 million to buy up rights and
preserve nearly 20,000 acres. The Legislature last December
approved an additional $35 million for the program.
   Why? ``You're preserving the economic fabric of the rural area.
It has an additional benefit. It's a working landscape,'' replied
August Schumacher Jr., Massachusetts commissioner of food and
agriculture.
   Ron Allbee, Vermont's commissioner of agriculture, agreed.
   ``We sell Vermont to tourists for the pristine open space, for
the small villages,'' Allbee said. ``I think there's a broader
concern. If we lose our agriculture, we're going to lose what
people identify as Vermont.''
   Even in big cities, such as Philadelphia, voters are
overwhelmingly approving bond issues to buy up the rights. There
are many reasons.
   In Pennsylvania, which is just beginning its program after
voters approved a $100 million bond issue in November, agriculture
is the No. 1 industry.
   Pennsylvania has 56,500 farms that produce crops worth $3.2
billion a year and generate $35 billion in related business. But
since 1960, the state has lost 50,000 farms and 3.8 million acres
of land that went out of production, most of it believed to be for
development.
   Along with economics, sentiment helped the pro-preservation
forces, state Sen. Noah W. Wenger said.
   ``Even people that live in the cities can remember their
grandfather or their uncle living on a farm,'' he said, ``and they
have a certain affinity to that and I think that was in its favor.''
   But even more, Wenger said, was the realization that about 20
percent of all the jobs in the state are related to agriculture.
   ``It's just good business sense to take care of your No. 1
industry,'' he said. ``You would spend $100 million to keep a basic
industry intact so that that industry can continue to pay taxes and
provide jobs so that we will have funds available to support our
social programs, our research programs.''
   Other referendums approved last November included a $65.2
million bond issue to help preserve open space in Rhode Island.
   And New Jersey voters, in their second referendum on the issue
in six years, overwhelmingly approved raising the state's share for
farm development buyouts to 80 percent, making it easier for
counties with limited funds to become partners.

   Arthur R. Brown Jr., secretary of the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture, considers farm land preservation his top priority
since such land in New Jersey has dropped from 2 million acres to
850,000 acres in the past 20 years.
   ``We're protecting a non-renewable resource, which is land,'' he
said. ``The citizens of New Jersey are ... behind keeping
agriculture here in the Garden State. And they're willing to pay
for it.''
   The trend toward preservation of farm land appears to be gaining
priority beyond the Northeast. ``The idea has begun to catch on,''
said American Farmland's Riggle.
   Californians will vote June 7 on a referendum for $776 million
to preserve open space, including farm land, greenbelts and parks.
The bond issue is the first in 74 years to be placed on the ballot
by voter petition rather than by the Legislature, underscoring the
growing enthusiasm.
   In Florida, a state law requires every county to develop within
the year a program to limit incursion into rural areas. More than
90 percent of all open land outside urban areas in Florida is farm
land.
   ``People are beginning to recognize the finite resource that we
have,'' said Ralph Grossi, president of American Farmland. ``Good
farm land is worth protecting. In many communities it is the buffer
zone between the next city, the open space people like to drive
to.''
   Riggle said the preservation programs are concentrated in the
Northeast because it is the oldest settled region and the states
are small, and often mountainous, limiting the amount of arable
land.
   ``The Northeast states have had to confront the issue of urban
growth and development versus open land resources sooner than the
rest of the country,'' he said.
   David Meade is one of the Northeast's concerned farmers. He sold
the development rights to 70 acres of his farm land in Howell
Township, N.J., near Freehold, to the state for about a half
million dollars last September. Developers had offered him more
than a million.
   ``I would only have to take that money and go out and buy
another one. Farming isn't an occupation. It's a way of life,'' he
said. ``It's not necessarily something you get into with the idea
of getting rich. It's something you get into because it's a matter
of the heart.''

   Stanley Baron's argument for preserving
farm land is right outside his picture window, which frames a view
of sheep grazing on alfalfa hay under ash and hemlock trees.
   ``I can't think of any explanation better than asking you to
look out that window,'' Baron told a visitor to his sheep farm 40
minutes from New York City. ``If you could preserve something like
that, wouldn't you do so?''
   Baron has been a leader in saving farm land _ and yet he
illustrates a dilemma posed by new programs compensating farmers
who agree to deed restrictions that keep their lands forever
undeveloped.
   Last October, he sold to the state of New Jersey the development
rights to a second farm he owns, an 85-acre site in nearby Neshanic
on which he grows alfalfa to feed his sheep.
   But he doesn't plan to sell the state the development rights to
the 86-acre sheep farm in Whitehouse. When he dies, he said, his
five children can decide.
   ``My heirs don't think highly of the program'' he said. ``They'd
rather see the land unencumbered so they can do with it whatever
they like after I die. ... They've never said that. I should only
say that my heirs have different circumstances. One of my heirs has
two children. He's out ... earning a living. And he says, `Hey,
what's going on? Why give it to the state? You can sell it
differently.'''
   Under New Jersey's farm land preservation program, the farmer is
paid the difference between the assessed value of the land for farm
production and its worth for development into housing or commercial
use. The state and counties share the cost.
   Baron stumbled into farming as a second career at age 50. He had
owned a paper bag manufacturing plant in New Jersey but lived in
New York and became fed up with the traffic jams on his commute.
   One day while driving with his wife, Nancy, he made a wrong turn
and ended up in the farm land of Hunterdon County.
   ``I said, `Why don't we find a place right here?' She went out
and shopped and then found this place. This had been a dairy farm
before we took over. It was empty of equipment and empty of
animals. I was wondering what we were going to do to keep the grass
down. Nancy said, `Sheep. I can handle sheep. They're small enough
for me.'''
   They moved to the Whitehouse farm in 1970. Baron sold his paper
business in 1979 and became a full-time farmer, now with a herd of
1,000.
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``I tell you, the best years of my
life.''

   Nebraska's long-running dispute over a
constitutional amendment created to protect family farmers has just
two points of agreement: It's the toughest corporate farm
restriction in the nation, and the fight's far from over.
   Each side claims to be working in the best interest of Nebraska
and its farmers.
   The question, according to a leading supporter, Marty Strange,
is whether ``Nebraska's ag future will develop on its family farm
base, whether farms in the future will be owned and operated by
people who live on them and are part of the community that those
farms are the economic base of.''
   John DeCamp, a lobbyist and former state senator, is an
outspoken opponent.
   ``It's a handicap to normal business and commerce as conducted
in the ... the United States,'' he said. ``A corporation is a
normal tool for doing business, just like a combine is a normal
tool for processing and harvesting corn.''
   The battle over what became Initiative 300 began in the early
1970s, as irrigation development and corporate interest in
agriculture burgeoned.
   The dispute peaked when corporate farming foes, frustrated by
years of legislative inaction, gathered enough signatures to place
a constitutional amendment on the 1982 general election ballot.
   The amendment ran about 1,100 words, but its basic provisions
were:
   _ Non-family farm corporations, with a few exceptions, cannot
own agricultural land or engage in farming and cannot own or feed
livestock, except for livestock purchased for slaughter and a few
other kinds.
   _ The majority of voting stock in family farm and ranch
corporations must be held by family members, at least one of whom
must live on the farm or be actively engaged in the daily labor and
management.
   _ Individuals and groups can seek enforcement if the secretary
of state or attorney general fails to enforce the amendment.
   An emotional campaign preceded the vote. Opponents said the
proposal would paralyze economic growth and stifle competition;
supporters argued that corporate farming threatened rural economic
and social foundations.
   Voters approved the amendment, 290,377 to 224,555, but the issue
remained unsettled.
   Legislators have tried unsuccessfully to pass laws clarifying
the amendment and to get voters to abolish it.
   A court challenge ended when the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled
the amendment constitutional. However, opponents say the court test
was decided on too narrow a question of law and talk of staging
another petition drive to return the issue to the ballot.
   Strange, senior associate for the Center for Rural Affairs in
Walthill, contends the amendment has done exactly what it was
designed to do _ protect family farmers from unfair corporate
competition.
   It is the nation's ``only truly effective'' family farm
legislation because it is in the state constitution and restricts
corporate farming activities as well as land ownership, he said.
   Opponents argue that Initiative 300 restricts business, scares
many companies away from investing in Nebraska, prevents farmers
from selling land to whomever they choose and affords protections
that are unfair, unnecessary and unrealistic.
   ``The only way that family farms will be saved is
economically,'' said state Sen. Dennis Baack, a vocal foe who farms
about 2,000 acres and raises wheat and sunflowers. ``We need prices
for our products. Those are the kind of things that will save
family farms. It's not going to be words in our constitution.''
   Another state senator, Ernie Chambers, said Initiative 300
hasn't been on the books long enough to assess whether it is
restricting business or helping farmers.
   ``The people are the ones who put it there and they did it
because the Legislature chose not to act,'' said Chambers, who
favors the measure.
   A U.S. District Court case, filed earlier this year by
opponents, is the first federal test of the amendment. A hearing is
scheduled April 18.
   The federal lawsuit, filed by Sunrise Ventures Inc., a custom
cattle-feeding operation, seeks to stop Attorney General Robert
Spire from enforcing Initiative 300 on the grounds it violates the
commerce, equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S
Constitution.
   Sunrise may be in violation of the amendment's prohibitions on
ownership of livestock, Spire said, but the company appears to be
exempt under a provision that allows ownership of animals
``purchased for slaughter.'' On that ground, Spire has asked that
Sunrise's suit be dismissed.
   Amendment opponents hailed Spire's action as a kind of
concession _ and a victory. DeCamp and Baack said it opened up the
issue because all cattle ultimately are slaughtered. ``There are
very few cattle in my district that live to be retired,'' Baack
said.
   Strange called Spire's action irresponsible, but said ``it
doesn't affect the foundation of the family farm amendment at all.''
   DeCamp agreed the dispute isn't over. If the Sunrise case is
dismissed, opponents will challenge the issues of land ownership
and engaging in farming, he said.
   ``This is just the beginning,'' he said. ``I'm sure the next
stage won't be so easy.''

   More than one farmer having trouble keeping ahead of his bills
has called on Amaranth, Arrowroot, Cipolines, Daikon and Manzano.
   They're not bankruptcy lawyers. They're exotic vegetables,
fruits and seeds.
   These and others, from fava beans to purple potatoes, are being
grown by ``gourmet farmers'' to meet an increasing demand for
specialty foods. In some cases, they are more profitable than
conventional crops.
   Frieda Caplan, owner of Frieda's Finest Produce Specialties
Inc., a Los Angeles-based company that markets unusual fruits and
vegetables to stores nationwide, said her sales had increased by
nearly 20 percent a year for the last four years to $15 million
currently.
   ``There has been an explosion in unusual foods,'' she said.
``One reason is the increased interest in health. Markets are
allocating more space to fresh produce. Smart retailers are putting
in a great deal of variety. They want the consumer to know they
have everything they want.''
   Some farmers, she said, are getting into specialty crops because
they are not making a living on the big conventional crops like
wheat, alfalfa and cotton.
   ``They're looking to find more profitable items to be grown,''
she said. ``They're beginning to learn that bigness does not
necessarily mean profitability. Sometimes you make more by growing
less.''
   George B. Holcomb, an official with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, said people today have higher living standards and
want more variety in their food.
   He said there is a growing demand for ethnic vegetables in most
of the larger cities. Exotic foods are being brought to this
country by immigrants from the Pacific Basin, Africa, Latin
America, the Caribbean and Europe.
   This is not to say that Kansas won't be corny in August anymore.
   After Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
suggested crop diversification and mentioned potentially lucrative
Belgian endive, a farmers group, the American Agriculture Movement,
surveyed 800 people around the country and found two-thirds had
never heard of it.
   So, some definitions:
   Amaranth is a seed with a mild nutty flavor that can be ground
into flour, popped like popcorn or sprinkled on cereals and ice
cream.
   Arrowroot is a Chinese potato.
   Cipolines are baby round onions.
   Daikon is a giant white oriental radish.
   A manzano is a small banana.
   Fava beans come in large pods and are tastier than lima beans.
   And purple potatoes? Cook them, and they just get purpler.

<HEAD>Japanese Car Makers Help Boost U.S. Motor Vehicle Exports To Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aided by the stronger yen, sales of U.S.-built
motor vehicles in Japan are expected to triple this year, but still
will hold only a marginal share of the world's second-largest auto
market.
   Sales of U.S.-built cars could reach 12,000 this year, out of a
6 million-vehicle market that includes minitrucks and minicars.
   But U.S. automakers should not be overjoyed at such growth,
because much of it will come from Japanese automakers who export
their U.S.-built cars to Japan, says Kunihiko Ono, an official at
the Japan Automobile Importers Association.
   Ono said the impetus for the surge would not come from the Big
Three U.S. automakers _ Chrysler Corp., Ford Motor Co. and General
Motors Corp. _ but from imports of the Honda Accord designed by the
wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Honda Motor Co. and
assembled at its plant in Marysville, Ohio.
   The expected surge in U.S. motor vehicle sales underscores the
efforts made by the governments of the United States, Japan,
Britain, France, and West Germany since September 1985 to reduce
trade imbalances by driving down the value of the dollar and
improving the export competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing industry.
   Ono also said foreign car makers should be more encouraged to
export to Japan because of the government's recent move to remove
tariffs on imported cars and relax elaborate import inspection
procedures.
   But Japanese government and industry officials criticize the
U.S. Big Three automakers for failing to capitalize on the dollar's
decline, which should make U.S. autos more competitive against
local models.
   Recent Japanese import statistics indicate only the West Germans
have been able to seize on a growing Japanese consumer preference
toward luxury cars fueled by the stronger buying power stemming
from the rising yen.
   Of the 97,750 foreign motor vehicles sold here last year, only
4,006 or 4.1 percent were U.S. made. West German makers accounted
for sales of 74,289 units, or 76 percent.
   Analysts say sales of U.S.-made motor vehicles in Japan have
been less than impressive since peaking at 16,739 vehicles in 1979.
   This week, Honda will become the first Japanese automaker to
import its U.S.-made cars when 540 Accords are unloaded from a
U.S.-flagged ship at Narashino Port, near Tokyo.
   Mazda Motor Co., a Ford affiliate, has announced that this
summar it will begin sales of the 2.2 liter-engined Ford Probe
built at Mazda's new plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. A Mazda
spokesman, Noboru Hosoya, says his company is hoping to handle
3,000 to 4,000 Probes annually in the future after selling 800
units this year.
   Many observers see the Big Three's problems as stemming from a
lack of commitment to Japan, not necessarily from current Japanese
business conditions.
   Honda Executive Vice President Koichiro Yoshizawa said that,
even accounting for export costs, it should cost as much to build
cars in the United States as it does in Japan as long as the dollar
remains near current levels.
   Takamori Matsuda, a vice president at Prudential-Bache
Securities (Japan) Ltd., says Detroit is suffering from an image
problem, as evidenced by deep-rooted Japanese consumer distrust
toward the Big Three's overall product quality as well as by
commonly held views about poor after-sales servicing, bad fuel
economy and high sticker prices.
   Other factors include the unsubstantiated association between
their cars and Japan's underworld, the Yakuza gangsters. The
Yakuzas are said to prefer driving large, luxurious U.S.-made cars.
Ono reports that parking lots in western Japanese cities, where
certain powerful Yakuza clans are based, refuse to admit foreign
cars, including Volkswagens, claiming they are a cause of trouble.
   To increase its market share in Japan, an official at a leading
Japanese automaker argues, Detroit should adopt a long-term
commitment that can withstand short-term losses.
   ``If they want a bigger slice of the market, they'd have to,
first, create Japanese sales subsidiaries and set up decent
distribution channels and reduce their reliance on small-scale
importers, and, second, market right-hand drive cars,'' he said.
   Analysts see recent moves by GM and Ford to team up with Mazda
and Suzuki Motor Co., respectively, as a step in the right
direction.
   One of Mazda's two dealer networks early this year added the
Ford Taurus to its product lineup and expects to sell 1,000 cars
this year.
   GM's joint operations with Suzuki, which is 5 percent controlled
by the U.S. automaker, will market two GM subcompacts starting in
April or May. Suzuki officials hope to sell 500 cars the first
year, and to boost sales to 3,000 units annually in three years.

<HEAD>Woolworth: Hafts Intend to Acquire Stake In Retailer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   F.W. Woolworth Co., faced with the prospect of
becoming Dart Group Corp.'s latest takeover target, is shoring up
its defenses.
   Woolworth said Monday that a partnership controlled by Dart
Chairman Herbert Haft _ who is fresh from an unsuccessful raid
against Stop & Shop Cos. _ had disclosed it planned to acquire $15
million or more of the retailer's stock.
   The nation's 13th largest retailer, which built its reputation
running a national chain of five-and-dime stores before expanding
into specialty retailing, said its board approved a ``poison pill''
takeover defense after Dart's disclosure.
   Woolworth issued a statement that its board adopted the defense
``to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics.''
   Wall Street indicated it expected the Hafts to make a bid soon
for Woolworth. The retailer's stock shot up $8.87{ to $54.12{ in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Based on Monday's closing stock price and the company's roughly
65.7 million common shares outstanding, Woolworth had a market
value of about $3.6 billion.
   Less than a month ago, Dart terminated a $1.03 billion bid for
Boston-based Stop & Shop after its target agreed to a leveraged
buyout by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   Landover, Md.-based Dart owns and operates Trak Auto Inc. and
Crown Books Corp.
   The Hafts repeatedly have said they were serious about buying
and operating a retailer, but doubts linger about their actual
intentions. Dart's string of unsuccessful but profitable takeover
moves against such retailers as Dayton Hudson Corp., Supermarkets
General Corp. and Safeway Stores Inc. in recent years has given
Haft and his son, Dart President Robert Haft, reputations as
corporate raiders.
   Dart has made millions of dollars from its takeover forays by
acquiring stock and later either selling it back to the target
company or to another suitor.
   Robert Haft was not available when a reporter called for comment
Monday.
   A source close to Dart confirmed the partnership had disclosed
in a March 18 filing with the federal government of its intentions
to acquire a Woolworth stake. The source declined to say whether a
takeover bid was in the offing.
   Joseph Carroll, a Woolworth spokesman, declined to comment when
asked what steps the company might take if and when the Hafts make
a takeover bid.
   Woolworth's poison pill would make a hostile takeover more
expensive by allowing the company's shareholders to buy its stock
at a steep discount. It becomes effective when an investor acquires
20 percent of Woolworth's stock, on the commencement of a tender
offer for 30 percent or more of the retailer's shares, or when a
hostile bidder acquires at least 15 percent of the company's stock.
   Edward Johnson, a retail industry analyst with Prescott Ball &
Turben Inc., said that if faced by a hostile buyout attempt
Woolworth might consider going private under a leveraged buyout.
   Other options open to the retailer include acquiring another
company itself or spinning off one of its units to shareholders.
   Johnson said Woolworth's low stock price and the company's
low-rental properties and successful specialty store formats make
it an attractive target. Woolworth, founded 109 years ago by Frank
W. Woolworth as a five-and-dime store, has grown to an empire of
more than 6,300 general merchandise and specialty stores worldwide.
In recent years, the company has shifted its focus from its
well-known Woolworth stores to its specialty operations, which
include Kinney shoe stores and Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker
athletic footwear stores.
   For the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, Woolworth earned $251 million
on sales of $7.14 billion.

<HEAD>Japan To Make Access to Agriculture Market Easier, But Slowly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONIKA JAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will attempt to widen foreign access to its
agricultural market while also securing basic domestic food
supplies, the government affirmed today in approving its annual
policy statement on agriculture.
   But a senior official said the rise in food imports will be kept
slow, despite increased U.S. pressure on Japan to open up its
agricultural market.
   Negotiations between U.S. and Japanese officials on access to
local markets broke down last week after Japan refused to terminate
stringent import quotas for beef and citrus fruits.
   An earlier four-year agreement on U.S. food imports expired
March 30. Japan has maintained it only will increase its quota
figures, while the United States has demanded total liberalization.
   U.S. officials say they will petition the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, an international forum that oversees trade rules
agreed upon by member nations, this week to convene a panel and
have the quota system deemed illegal under international trading
rules.
   Soshichiro Nakagawa, director of the Research Division of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said Japan could
not drop all food import quotas without causing widespread
disruption. But he said the government expects to decrease its
present beef self-sufficiency rate of 70 percent to between 55 and
60 percent by 1995.
   Because domestic beef supplies are growing slowly, most of the
increasing demand for beef must be accounted for by imports,
Nakagawa said.
   ``We will try to open our markets and improve access, but at the
same time try to strengthen the structure and constitution of the
competitiveness of the Japanese agricultural industry,'' Nakagawa
told reporters at a briefing on the agricultural white paper, or
policy document.
   While less than 10 percent of Japan's population is engaged in
farming, farmers provide a strong backbone for the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party. Attempts to open up any section of the
agricultural market traditionally have met with strong resistance.
   The white paper said the government's first major task in coming
years will be to establish a self-supporting, highly productive
agricultural industry.
   ``We are not saying that there should be self-sufficiency in
food at any or all costs,'' Nakagawa said, but ``the first priority
or task is to make sure that there is a stable supply of food.''
   The director said government will combine domestic production
with ``an appropriate level of imports from overseas so that...food
supply will be secured on a stable basis.''
   Nakagawa also said the government will reduce its price supports
for some products, such as eggs, because of the intense price war
that has sprung up between domestic and foreign foods because of
the sharp appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar since
September 1985.
   But he added the yen's upward swing would have slow impact on
products from land-based farming, such as rice.
   ``Therefore some price gap (between domestic and imported foods)
would have to remain and we must gain the understanding and
convince the public that the gap is inevitable,'' Nakagawa said.
``And to the extent that some gaps remain, some protective measures
will have to be kept in place for such commodities as rice and
beef.''
   Nakagawa declined to comment on how Japan would react if GATT
ruled against the import quotas that are under fire from the United
States. The trade body ordered Japan in February to lift import
curbs on 10 types of farm products to get into line with
international rules, following a 1987 probe sparked by an American
complaint.
   While Japan accepted the ruling on eight of the products, it
refused to lift curbs on starch and dairy products and to date has
not stated any clear measures on eliminating the import barriers on
the eight products, which include tomato ketchup, glucose and
caramel.
   But Nakagawa said Japan was obligated to implement the findings
of the report and will ``have to work with the United States to map
out the specifics and substance of what should be done.''

<HEAD>Mexico Cheapest, Norway Most Expensive for US Employers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico was the cheapest country last year and
Norway the most expensive for U.S. employers who measure labor
costs in dollars, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Labor
Department.
   In dollar terms, costs in Mexico were $1.37 an hour in 1987,
compared with $1.49 in 1986 and a U.S. average of $13.46. Wages
more than doubled when measured in Mexican pesos, but the peso's
foreign exchange value fell so quickly that labor costs in dollars
actually declined.
   Norway's average hourly compensation totaled 118.52 kroner, or
about $17.58.
   The figures released Monday take into account of the drop in the
value of the dollar, changes in local pay rates, the cost of social
insurance and other benefits. The calculations do not include the
relative efficiency of workers in different countries.
   Wages and other benefits for workers rose in terms of Brazilian
cruzados, but in dollar terms there was a decline to $1.49 from
$1.60 an hour because of the low value of the cruzado against the
dollar.
   Brazil and Mexico are the Third World's two biggest debtors,
which tends to depress the foreign exchange value of their
currencies. They were the only two nations where dollar-denominated
labor costs dropped last year.
   Low wage rates in developing countries are considered a key
competitive advantage for those nations in exporting goods to the
United States.
   Labor in the newly-industrialized countries of Asia and Latin
America remained less than a fifth as costly as in the United
States. Costs in Asia's ``four tigers'' _ Hong Kong, South Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan _ rose by only 1 to 4 percentage points
relative to those in the United States.
   Of 22 countries, eight had costs higher than the $13.46 U.S.
hourly average.
   They were, in addition to Norway: Switzerland, 25.46 Swiss
francs, or $17.06; West Germany, 30.26 marks, or $16.83; Sweden,
96.07 krona, or $15.14; Netherlands, 30.61 guilders, or $15.11;
Belgium, 563.37 Belgian francs, or $15.08 and Denmark, 99.20
kroner, or $l4.49.
   All 23 countries for which the Labor Department had statistics,
including the United States, showed higher labor costs in terms of
their own currency.
   ``Japan's relative cost level in 1987 _ of 84 percent _ greatly
exceeded the previous peak of 72 percent reached in 1986,'' said
the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   The increase in Japan's labor costs was due largely to the rise
of the yen against the dollar. That also was the reason for most of
the rise in European costs, although they also were affected by
declines in working hours by Norway and Denmark, the report stated.

<HEAD>University Setting Up International Computer Bank Of Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American companies soon will have access
to a new computer database offering information about millions of
products made by their foreign competitors, according to the head
of the University of Tennessee project.
   ``It is the only one of its kind in the country,'' David Faulds,
assistant professor of international marketing, said Monday. ``It's
kind of surprising given the emphasis on product quality now.''
   The International Product Quality Database uses various consumer
reports to come up with product quality rankings from on an item
and on up to 48 specific product features, said Faulds. It also has
marketing information on the products, he said.
   ``We're still compiling (entries) and trying to develop
off-campus computer capability...so U.S. companies can tap into
this by phone,'' Faulds said.
   C. Warren Neel, dean of the university's College of Business
where the database was created, said the computer bank would give
U.S. manufacturers an edge in knowing the strengths and weaknesses
of their international competition, thereby helping them improve
their own positions in the marketplace.
   So far, the database has nearly a million brand names and
rankings on products sold in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
France, West Germany, Great Britain, Japan, The Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.
   Faulds said the database should be available to American
companies in less than two years, but the university had not
decided whether to let foreign businesses have access.
   ``We're kind of debating that right now,'' he said. ``There is a
political side.''
   Faulds said he has spent five years collecting the product
quality rankings and comments by such groups as automobile testers,
government bureaus, engineering associations, independent and
consumer product testing groups.

<HEAD>Chrysler Workers Gathering to Set Demands for Contract Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. workers, anxious to receive the
same benefits that General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. workers
received in new contracts last fall, are preparing contract demands
for talks beginning April 18.
   Members of the United Auto Workers union's 140-member national
Chrysler council were to begin arriving in Kansas City, Mo., today
for a meeting with national UAW leaders and elected union
bargainers.
   By Friday, the council planned to have discussed and approved
demands that will guide how the industry pattern contract,
established at the two larger companies, can be installed at the
smallest Big Three automaker.
   The Chrysler contract, covering 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off
workers, expires Sept. 14. Talks are scheduled to begin April 18,
instead of mid-July as usual.
   The two sides agreed to early talks to stem damage inflicted by
friction over Chrysler's closing of an assembly plant in Kenosha,
Wis., and the abortive sale of its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts
subsidiary.
   Chrysler was stunned by the speed and severity of the union's
opposition to the proposed Acustar sale. Angry workers at locals
across the nation began preparing ``strike packages'' _ lists of
grievances over locally strikeable issues _ and stopped cooperating
in crucial management-union programs aimed at improving quality and
production efficiency.
   UAW Vice President Marc Stepp, who will lead negotiations with
Chrysler, told workers at the time that he would give local unions
with grievances permission to strike immediately.
   A few strikes at key assembly and parts plants could have
crippled Chrysler as quickly as a national strike.
   Chrysler quickly backed down from the proposed sale in early
March and agreed to early contract talks, a request it had refused
last fall after the union wrapped up contracts at Ford and GM.
   Negotiators on both sides are limited to working within the
pattern contract, which forbids layoffs except during declining
sales of a particular product and requires automakers to continue
paying workers whose jobs are lost to productivity improvements,
new technology or transfer of work to outside suppliers.
   The pattern contract also includes joint six-month,
plant-by-plant studies that will examine ways to strengthen
operations and keep work inside each company. The UAW hopes the
studies will make it harder for automakers to pit plant against
plant in competition for a shrinking number of jobs.
   The UAW is expected to seek a two-year contract instead of the
usual three-year pact so that its contracts with all Big Three
makers will expire together in 1990.
   The union also will seek more representation on the Chrysler
board of directors. UAW President Owen Bieber has a board seat, but
the union believes holding more seats will give it more control
over Chrysler decisions.
   Bargainers will work against an artificial target deadline
instead of a strike deadline, so Chrysler faces no risk of a
companywide strike if talks fail. Industry analysts expect a quick
settlement.
   But a failure at the table would sour relations and make talks
more difficult when the two sides were forced to resume bargaining
in the summer.

<HEAD>Filmmaker Receives Several Takeover Proposals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several unidentified suitors have
made takeover proposals for MGM-UA Communications Inc., the
filmmaker that was sold and bought back by financier Kirk Kerkorian.
   The company's announcement Monday sent MGM-UA stock up $3 for
the day to close at $12 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The offers will be studied by a special committee of directors
which was to be created at a scheduled board meeting today.
   ``We have a duty to our shareholders to explore these matters,''
said Lee Rich, MGM-UA's chairman and chief executive.
   Rich declined to identify the suitors but analysts suggested
Kerkorian, who owns 79 percent of the company's 50.1 million
shares, may be seeking to take MGM-UA private.
   Other possible suitors, they said, are investors Marvin Davis
and Burt Sugarman, whose separate bids for other companies are
stalled and considered unlikely to succeed. Davis had no comment, a
spokesman said, and Sugarman was traveling and unavailable for
comment.
   The company said it announced the proposals when the New York
Stock Exchange expressed concern over an unusual increase in
trading of the company's stock.
   Kerkorian had been majority owner of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
and United Artists studios, then sold them in 1986 to media
entrepreneur Ted Turner for $1.5 billion plus assumption of some of
its debt. As part of that deal, Kerkorian immediately bought back
the UA segment.
   Later, Turner sold off all of the MGM unit, except its film
library, which he retained for use on his Atlanta-based
superstation WTBS. Kerkorian purchased the studio and Lorimar
Telepictures Corp. bought some other assets.
   Kerkorian paid a total of $730 million to buy back the two
segments.
   The new MGM-UA has had spotty success.
   Its recent film ``Moonstruck'' is a box-office hit and has been
nominated for six Academy Awards.
   Its new film, ``Bright Lights, Big City,'' starring Michael Fox,
ranked third in box-office gross for its debut weekend. Ticket
sales still were being tallied. Last year, the company scored a hit
with the James Bond thriller ``The Living Daylights.''
   But MGM-UA also has had box-office flops, including its
critically acclaimed but poorly attended ``Masquerade,'' as well as
``Fatal Beauty,'' ``Real Men,'' and ``Dead of Winter.''
   For its first quarter ended Nov. 30, earnings dropped 19 percent
to $2.1 million from $2.6 million, although revenue rose 39 percent
to $182 million from $131 million.
   The company cited continuing high start-up costs as well as an
unspecified writedown on the film ``Real Men.''
   For its first fiscal year ended Aug. 31, the company lost $88.1
million on revenue of $427.6 million.
   Davis, who has been seeking to get back into the entertainment
business since selling 20th Century Fox Film Corp. three years ago,
is bidding $770.1 million for Lorimar Telepictures Corp. But that
bid has been given short shrift by Lorimar, which is discussing a
merger with Warner Communications Inc.
   Sugarman, whose holdings range from cement production to the
company that created ``The Dating Game,'' is offering $1.58 billion
for Richmond, Va.,-based Media General Corp., which owns newspapers
and radio stations. But his overtures have been spurned by the
company's founding family, which holds voting control.

<HEAD>Import Automakers' Study Refutes Big Three Dumping Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. auto importers have issued a study
attempting to refute a Big Three review that found Japanese
automakers were dumping compact pickup trucks on the U.S. market.
   The importers' study found Japanese automakers continued earning
profits averaging $1,000 per vehicle sold in the United States
compared with the $100-$125 profit on each vehicle they sold in
Japan.
   Japanese companies were earning an average $2,000 per vehicle
sold here when the yen began appreciating against the dollar in
1985, leaving a cushion that let them raise prices by less than the
yen had appreciated while preserving profits, the study indicated.
   The study was prepared by ICF Inc., a Fairfax, Va., research
firm, for Automobile Importers of America in anticipation of a
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association study released last week.
   The import association's members include Toyota Motor Corp.,
Honda Motor Co., Mazda Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Nissan
Motor Co. Ltd., Isuzu Motor Co. Ltd. and Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd.
   The MVMA study, prepared on behalf of General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., was conducted by a Washington law
firm and found that Japanese makers were charging 10 percent to 48
percent less at the factory for small pickups destined for the U.S.
market than for the same vehicles destined for their home market.
   The MVMA study also argued that the Big Three U.S. automakers
were being injured by the dumping because they were not able to
make full use of factories and Japanese undercutting had hurt their
profits.
   The importers' study looked mostly at cars because of the
strength of the domestic truck market, John Reilly, the analyst who
prepared it, said Monday.
   ``One reason we weren't concerned about doing a dumping
calculation on trucks was because the (domestics makers') market
performance was so strong in terms of growth in sales and growth in
market share,'' Reilly said.
   In 1987, sales of small pickups by General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. grew by about 10 percent, or 135,000
trucks, while Japanese makers' sales fell by about the same in a
steady market, he said.
   Truck buyers are motivated strongly by price, Reilly said, so if
the Japanese makers were pricing unfairly low they would have held
or gained sales.
   The study, completed March 14, also indicated:
   _About 25 percent of Japanese makers' costs, including
advertising, marketing, distribution and freight, are incurred in
dollars and are not affected by the currency's weakness against the
yen.
   _Japanese companies have countered some of the pressures of the
strong yen by improving productivity and transferring parts
production from Japan to lower-cost countries such as South Korea
and Thailand.
   A U.S. industry charging foreign competitors with dumping, or
selling products in this market for less than in their home market
or for less than the cost of production, must prove it has been
harmed by the practice before the U.S. government will impose
punitive import duties.
   In the study, Reilly stated domestic makers held their share of
the U.S. car and truck market in 1987 despite a 1 million-vehicle
drop in their sales and a 1.15 million-vehicle overall drop in the
market.
   Much of the decline was borne by GM, whose share of the domestic
market fell nearly five percentage points in 1987 as its lost sales
to domestic competitors rather than to foreign makers, the study
found.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Hostile Takeover Bid For Koppers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investor partnership pursuing a hostile
$1.7 billion tender offer to acquire Koppers Co. is appealing a
federal judge's order blocking the takeover attempt.
   Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles on Monday granted a preliminary
injunction to succeed his March 25 restraining order, which
temporarily halted the $60 a share bid by BNS Inc., a partnership
headed by British industrialist Brian Beazer and the investment
firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Koppers, a construction materials and services company that also
manufactures chemicals, has resisted the takeover attempt and
sought to block it in federal court on antitrust grounds. Beazer is
chairman of Beazer PLC, a general construction and construction
materials company.
   BNS immediately appealed the preliminary injunction to the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Koppers stock declined 50 cents to $57.25 a share Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Separately, in Pittsburgh Gov. Robert P. Casey asked a federal
judge to allow his administration to intervene on behalf of Koppers
in another company lawsuit aimed at thwarting the takeover.
   Koppers had filed a federal lawsuit in Pittsburgh accusing the
unwanted suitors of violating securities laws.
   In a brief to U.S. District Judge Maurice Cohill, Casey said the
potential loss of 1,100 Pittsburgh-area employees of Koppers'
chemical businesses would hurt the local economy. It also said the
takeover could jeopardize agreements Koppers entered to reduce
pollution from its facilities.
   ``These environmental obligations could seriously impair the
ability of (the buyers) to obtain financiang for the offer and
impair the sale of the chemical assets,'' Casey's general counsel,
Morey M. Myers, said.
   Koppers also contended the company's stock was worth more than
the $60 a share offered by the Beazer group.
   Beazer attended the Pittsburgh hearing, but declined comment
afterward.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies
in quiet early trading in Europe today when markets reopened after
a four-day shutdown in most centers for the long Easter holiday
weekend.
   Gold prices were mixed after the holiday break.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.58 yen to close at 124.43 yen, compared
with 123.85 on Monday. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at
124.52 yen.
   In London, the British pound, which hit a six-year high of
$1.8895 for two straight days last Thursday and Friday, eased to
$1.888. However, many dealers expected sterling to push ahead later
in the week.
   One Frankfurt dealer said general market sentiment toward the
dollar appeared cool, despite the rises in early trading.
   ``Few people want to give dollars at this level,'' said the
dealer. ``They are keeping an eye on the central banks and are
holding back. No sudden fall, but the dollar may drift slowly
lower.''
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning today, compared with late
Friday's quotes, included: 1.6585 West German marks, up from
1.6565; 1.3658 Swiss francs, up from 1.3635; 5.6225 French francs,
down from 5.6270; 1.8615 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8595; 1,230.20
Italian lire, up from 1,228.75; and 1.2415 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2335.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $455.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $454.50. At mid-morning Tuesday, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $456.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $455.75, down from $457.50
late Thursday.
   Bullion dealers said trading was quiet with no new direction
following the Easter holiday.
   In Hong Kong, gold markets were closed because of a public
holiday.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.78 a troy
ounce, compared with Thursday's $6.72.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises From Three-Month Low, Stocks Fall Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar, recovering from a three-month low
against the Japanese yen, edged upward today in Tokyo. Stock prices
remained little changed in lackluster trading.
   After opening at 124.38 yen, the dollar edged up and ended the
day at 124.43 yen, up 0.58 yen from the Monday's close of 123.85
yen. It ranged between 124.30 yen-124.75 yen. On Monday, the U.S.
currency, opened at 123.70, its lowest opening level since Jan. 5
when it started trading at 123 yen.
   ``The dollar gained ground following an overnight advance at
Wall Street,'' said Ken Iiya of the Bank of Tokyo.
   There was nothing in particular to move market today, and
participants were only ``adjusting their positions'' in trading
currencies, he said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 53.17 points Monday, slipped a modest 19.94
points, or 0.07 percent, today to move to 26,315.35 at the end of
the day's trading.
   ``Market fundamentals are firm,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko
Securities.
   He said the small decline of the stock market's key indicator
was prompted by participants having a wait-and-see attitude and
profit-taking selling after a quick surge in early morning trade.
   The Nikkei Stock Average rose 92 points just 27 minutes into the
seesion.
   Many investors stayed on the sidelines, cautious over what
effect higher U.S. interest rates may have on New York stocks,
another trader said.
   Share prices were mixed with the volume of the first section
trade standing at a light 700 million shares, down from 1.1 billion
shares Monday.
   Popular issues were textiles, foodstuffs and department stores.
Among the losers were steel, shipbuilding, heavy electricals and
some of the financials.

   A record $3 million libel award against CBS
that the Supreme Court has refused to disturb is not likely to have
widespread impact on the news media, says an authority on libel law.
   Henry Kaufman of the Libel Defense Resource Center in New York
City said the case does not establish a significant precedent
because the facts involved are unique.
   But Kaufman did say that the case, stemming from a broadcast on
a CBS-owned television station in Chicago, changes the
psychological landscape.
   ``This is the first libel award that has broken through the
psychological $1 million barrier on appeal, the first that has been
able to make it through the process intact,'' he said.
   Kaufman, whose organization is funded by the news media,
expressed disappointment along with CBS officials that the Supreme
Court on Monday left the libel judgment intact.
   News organizations had hoped the case could be used to mount a
First Amendment attack against punitive damages in libel cases,
Kaufman said. ``That opportunity has passed for the time being,''
he said.
   ``We're disappointed,'' said Doug Jacobs, associate general
counsel for CBS Inc. ``We believed these issues were important
enough for review.''
   The case stems from a suit by Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.
of Louisville, Ky., which makes Viceroy cigarettes. It accused CBS
and WBBM-TV anchorman Walter Jacobson in Chicago of libeling it in
a Nov. 11, 1981, broadcast.
   Jacobson, in a nightly feature called ``Walter Jacobson's
Perspective,'' said there was a Viceroy advertising strategy to
attract young people to smoking by relating cigarettes ``to pot,
wine, beer and sex.'' He said the idea was to present cigarette
smoking as ``an initiation into the adult world ... as an illicit
pleasure.''
   A federal jury awarded the cigarette company $5 million. The 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld $3 million of the award
against CBS and $50,000 against Jacobson.
   The $3 million award _ plus some $400,000 in interest _ is about
four times the largest previous damage judgment against a news
organization upheld on appeal. Awards upheld on appeal average
between $100,000 and $150,000.
   In the CBS case, the appeals court rejected arguments that the
broadcast was intended as opinion and thus could not be libelous.
   The appeals court said the remarks about Viceroy were intended
to be factual, even if the tone of the broadcast made it sound like
something else.
   The appeals court also rejected CBS's claim that the broadcast
was truthful.
   There was insufficient evidence that the cigarette company
actually adopted a strategy of attracting young smokers by relating
cigarettes ``to pot, wine, beer and sex,'' the appeals court said.
   Finally, the appeals court ruled that Jacobson and CBS acted
with ``actual malice'' in broadcasting the commentary.
   For a public figure to win a libel suit, it must be shown there
was actual malice _ that statements were made with knowledge they
were false or with reckless disregard for the truth. The cigarette
company was held to be a public figure.

declines in New York and Tokyo and by the continuing strength of
the British currency.
   Trading volume was light on the first day after the four-day
Easter holiday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was off 16.9
points, or 1 percent, at 1,725.6 at midday.
   Volume was a low 170.1 million shares, down from 175.0 million
shares at midday Thursday.
   The market opened weaker on the back of previous declines in New
York and Tokyo.
   After recovering a little during the morning, the London market
fell again as the pound resumed its recent rise against the West
German mark. The rise has unsettled the equity market because of
worries about its effect on the major exporting companies' stocks,
which benefit from a weak pound.

<HEAD>Hallmark Joins With KCSI To Turn Back Buy-Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and
Hallmark Cards Inc. have paid investor Howard Kaskel $77.6 million
for his 11.3 percent stake in Kansas City Southern.
   In return, Kaskel ended a nearly eight-month pursuit of Kansas
City Southern.
   Kansas City Southern bought 54 percent of Kaskel's stock, or
694,000 shares, for $41.6 million while Hallmark bought the
remaining 600,600 shares for $36 million.
   If approved by regulators, Hallmark's purchase will make it
Kansas City Southern's largest stockholder, with 1.04 million
shares, or 9.4 percent of those outstanding. The Kansas City-based
greeting card giant said it liked Kansas City Southern's long-term
prospects and didn't plan to take control.
   Hallmark, which is closely held, previously owned 4 percent of
Kansas City Southern's stock. Irvine O. Hockaday Jr., president and
chief executive officer of Hallmark, held a similar position at
Kansas City Southern from 1981 until 1983.
   The buy-out alliance between the companies was forged quickly
and sealed Sunday or Monday, Kansas City Southern spokesman Fred
Spar said.
   A spokesman for Kaskel said he sold out because he was not
interested in pursuing a hostile takeover.
   Kaskel proposed a friendly buyout of the Kansas City Southern
shares that his group didn't own for $587.6 million, or $60 apiece.
The offer was spurned and Kaskel threatened a proxy battle to name
two of his group to the board of directors at Kansas City
Southern's annual meeting May 3.

<HEAD>Trade Journal: Japanese Imports Below Quota for '87 Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese automakers will fall short of their
quota for car exports to the United States in the fiscal year ended
March 31, an industry trade journal says.
   Lagging sales by Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. will account for most of
the shortfall, Automotive News predicted Monday.
   The Japanese government limits its automakers' car exports to
the U.S. to 2.3 million a year. Automotive News predicted that a
final tally of shipments will indicate a shortfall of 70,000 to
100,000 cars.
   Nissan shipped about 475,544 cars to the United States for the
1987 fiscal year, about 66,200 below its allocation from the
Japanese government, Automotive News said, citing high inventories
and slow sales of Nissan cars here.
   The Japanese government divides the total quota among exporting
automakers, preventing companies that use their full allocation
from shipping additional cars to take up the slack left by
companies with slow sales.
   Nissan's 1987 U.S. import sales were off 17.2 percent from 1986
and had dropped a further 32.2 percent in 1988 as of February.
Analysts have said Nissan sales have slipped recently because the
automaker has introduced relatively few new products.
   Automotive News said Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Mazda
Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., which imports
Mitsubishi cars, and Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru
cars, were expected to have used their entire 1987 allocations.
   Robert McCurry, senior vice president for Toyota Motor Sales
U.S.A., has said that his company easily could sell more cars if it
were allowed to use the left-over allocations of companies such as
Nissan.
   While Honda and Toyota had few unsold cars in their inventories,
other makes had more than 50 days' worth, high for Japanese
companies, and Nissan had an estimated 206 days' supply, the trade
journal said.
   The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which
sets the quota, is expected to maintain the 2.3 million level for
fiscal 1988 despite pressure from U.S. automakers.
   The Big Three have called for a lower export quota to
incorporate the growing number of Japanese cars built in the United
States. Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Mazda build cars here; Mitsubishi
will begin production this year in Bloomington-Normal, Ill.
   Toyota also will begin production this year at a new factory in
Georgetown, Ky., where it will build the Toyota Camry sedan, while
Subaru and Isuzu Motor Co. Ltd. are building a joint-venture plant
in Lafayette, Ind.
   These plants will have a combined capacity to build up to 2.5
million cars a year by 1990 at a time when the Big Three are
closing plants because they have too much capacity.

<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. of Japan has notified the Transport
Ministry that it will recall 158,000 Prelude cars because of a
defective oil pressure hose in the power steering, a ministry
official said.
   The official, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity, said
the Preludes to be recalled were produced between March 19, 1987
and March 31, 1988.
   Of the vehicles to be recalled, 92,497 cars were exported,
including 66,239 to the United States, 10,311 to Canada, 3,023 to
Britain and the rest to nine other countries including West Germany.
   If the hoses are not replaced the cars might leak oil, the
official said.

<HEAD>Resorts International Directors To Talk With Griffin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of Resorts International Inc.
spurned the latest takeover offer from entertainer Merv Griffin,
but formed a special panel to meet with Griffin to decide if an
acceptable offer could be made.
   Although the action Monday appeared to open the door slightly to
Griffin, Resorts Chairman Donald Trump, who holds 88 percent of the
company's voting power, also renewed his pledge not to sell his
stock to the entertainer or to terminate a lucrative five-year
management contract with the company.
   Trump also vowed to block efforts by Griffin to get the company
to sell him 1.2 million new shares of Class B stock, which carries
100 votes per share. Such a move would give Griffin more voting
strength than Trump.
   Trump owns 95 percent of the company's current 572,000 Class B
shares.
   The company also has 5.7 million shares of Class A stock, which
carries one vote per share.
   Griffin has said in the past that he wouldn't be interested in
becoming partners with Trump.
   Griffin is offering $36 a share for Resorts' Class A common
shares and for the 1.2 million Class B shares that would be newly
issued.
   Trump's holdings could be sold under the offer only if they were
converted to Class A stock. Trump bought his stock a year ago for
$135 a share, but it has since lost much of its value.
   Last week, Trump abandoned his own tender offer to buy the stock
he doesn't already own for $22 a share.
   Resorts said a special committee comprised of Trump and a Trump
ally plus two outside directors would ``engage in discussions with
The Griffin Co. to explore whether an acceptable offer would be
made.''
   This is the first time that Resorts has indicated any
willingness to hold talks with the entertainer's privately held
investment company.
   Earlier in the day, Griffin said he and the president of his
company are to meet with New Jersey gaming officials next week on
Griffin's takeover bid for Resorts.
   The meetings are the start of a licensing process that usually
lasts a few weeks.

   The stock market advanced in early trading today
as bargain hunters began to show an interest in equities.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.78 to 1,990.38 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 12 to 7 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.22 million shares as of 10

   ``The bargain-hunting may run its course in a couple of hours
and things could turn down, but there's no disaster here,'' he said.
   Stock prices eased somewhat on Monday, but analysts were not
concerned, noting light volume and a drifting trend.
   Among actively traded issues, Woolworth was up 1| to 55} after

   The seven Japanese automakers' plants in the
United States may cause 45,000 jobs to be lost in the domestic
industry, far fewer than the number estimated by the United Auto
Workers, a government study says.
   The General Accounting Office study said that its estimate for
job losses from 1985 through 1990 was based on worst-case
assumptions, and the number of jobs actually lost could be less.
   The GAO study, requested by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., Marcy
Kaptur, D-Ohio, and Edward Madigan, R-Ill., placed the job loss at
slightly less than a quarter the 200,000 lost jobs expected by the
UAW.
   Imports, increased productivity and use of foreign parts will
shrink the number of auto-industry jobs by 1990, according to the
study, released Monday.
   ``The operations of Japanese-affiliated automakers in the United
States could result in even more losses because they use fewer
workers and more foreign content than U.S. automakers,'' the study
said.
   Japanese auto plants in the United States were established in
part to forestall protectionist legislation in Congress by giving
U.S. workers a chance to work in Japanese assembly plants.
   Japanese automakers have invested more than $5 billion in U.S.
assembly plants since 1980. Besides the seven Japanese auto
manufacturers, more than 100 Japanese auto parts suppliers operate
in the United States.
   The GAO estimate was based on what the study called unprovable
assumptions about the extent to which U.S.-made Japanese autos cut
into domestic manufacturing rather than displace imports.
   The worst-case estimate assumed 85 percent of Japan's U.S.
production displaced production by the domestic automakers, a level
the agency called ``relatively high.''
   At a 70 percent displacement rate, the job loss shrinks to
17,000, and from 60 percent down the Japanese production creates
more jobs than it eliminates, the study said.
   The GAO study also assumed half the Japanese makers' parts would
be bought in the United States and that U.S. production by Japanese
makers would total 1.8 million vehicles in 1990.
   The UAW study produced a higher job-loss estimate because it
assumed the Japanese manufacturers would build 2.2 million vehicles
in the United States, all of which would cut into domestic
production, and would buy only 30 percent of their parts in the
United States.

   Developer Edward J. DeBartolo says he's
negotiating to acquire part of Federated Department Stores Inc.
from Canadian developer Robert Campeau.
   Campeau Corp. has agreed to pay $6.6 billion for
Cincinnati-based Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer.
   ``We're going to own a part of Federated, and we'll be in the
development end of Federated,'' DeBartolo said Monday from his
office in Youngstown, Ohio. ``We're going to be joint-venture
partners with Campeau in all new development deals that come out of
Allied Stores and Federated.''
   DeBartolo loaned Campeau about $480 million toward the Federated
acquisition in return for more than 50 percent of the shares of its
U.S. holding company, Campeau Corp. U.S.
   DeBartolo said he is still negotiating the percentage stake
he'll have in Federated, which owns such retailers as
Bloomingdale's, Filene's, Abraham & Straus and Foley's.
   Campeau battled R.H. Macy & Co. in a 10-week bidding war for
Federated. In a compromise, Campeau agreed to sell Federated's I.
Magnin and Bullock's-Bullock's Wilshire divisions to Macy for $1.1
billion.
   ``It was tough,'' DeBartolo said of the bidding war. ``It was a
good battle because both sides won.''
   Two years ago, DeBartolo loaned $150 million to Campeau to help
finance the $3.5 billion purchase of New York-based Allied Stores
Corp. DeBartolo had been an unsuccessful bidder for Allied, which
includes retailers Ann Taylor, Brooks Brothers and Jordan-Marsh.
   DeBartolo said areas where he and Campeau might expand include
the West and East coasts. Mall developers, including DeBartolo and
Campeau, in recent years have acquired retail chains, which give
them enormous leverage in developing malls and drawing other retail
tenants.

   Dayton Power & Light Co. must deliver
electricity generated by the non-profit Buckeye Power Inc.
cooperative to the city of St. Marys, a federal appeals court ruled
today.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled in favor of St. Marys, Buckeye Power and the affiliated
American Municipal Power-Ohio Inc. electricity cooperative in a
7-year-old dispute with Dayton Power & Light.
   The appeals court's unanimous decision upholds a Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission ruling that DP&L is bound by terms of a 1968
contract to deliver the Buckeye Power-generated electricity over
DP&L's power network to the city of St. Marys. Dayton Power & Light
had disagreed and appealed the commission's ruling.
   The appeals court said a Jan. 1, 1968, contract between Buckeye
Power and six investor-owned utilities, including Dayton Power &
Light, requires DP&L to ``wheel' the power over its lines from the
Buckeye cooperative to St. Marys. DP&L lawyers argued that the
company did not intend, under terms of the 1968 contract, to
deliver such power.
   St. Marys operates a municipal electric utility and buys
electric power from both DP&L and American Municipal Power-Ohio
Inc., a non-profit Ohio corporation which buys electricity from
Buckeye Power members for resale to AMP-Ohio member municipal
utilities.
   Buckeye Power generates and transmits electricity for 29 member
systems that constitute all of the electric cooperatives selling
power in Ohio.
   The dispute dates to April 1981.

   Tandy Corp.'s success in retailing home
computers is not carrying over easily into the big-business market.
   The parent company of the Radio Shack chain of electronics
stores announced its big push into the Fortune 1000 last August and
has relatively little to show for it so far.
   General Electric Co. and Wells Fargo Bank are the only big
customers that have so far allowed Tandy to mention them by name.
   The Radio Shack name, a magnet in shopping malls, does not
impress people who run corporate data centers. And some analysts
believe the company lacks the technical and sales savvy to make it
against industry giants like International Business Machines Corp.
   Tandy has about 8 percent of the overall U.S. computer market,
but only 2 to 3 percent of the Fortune 1000, according to Future
Computing Inc., a Dallas-based market researcher.
   ``The old Radio Shack quality issue still hurts them,'' said
John C. McCarthy, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. ``It's one thing to buy a tape deck that doesn't work, but
it's another thing to have the computer that you're running your
company on break down.''
   The knock on quality may be unjustified, based on independent
evaluations. But Tandy still strikes some corporate buyers as a
company for electronics hobbyists.
   Computers made up only about 30 percent of Tandy's business last
year, outweighed by its sales of electronic parts and equipment,
radios, telephones, video equipment, tape recorders, toys and
communication equipment.
   Playing to its strengths, Tandy continues to focus most of its
efforts on selling to small- and medium-sized companies, Ed Juge,
the director of market planning, said in a recent interview.
   ``We have not claimed to have made large inroads into the big
corporate market. What we have said is that our level of
penetration is much greater,'' Juge said. ``It's never been our
intention to unseat IBM.''
   Juge said members of the sales force are told that for every
call they make on a Fortune 1000 company, they should be making
about 70 calls to smaller companies.
   Tandy's push to move in on IBM's established big-business market
began in August 1987. It centered on creating Tandy computer
centers separate from the Radio Shack stores, spending $80 million
to refurbish many of the 8,500 outlets and improving training for
sales people.
   That sales force has encountered some resistance, but most
companies are willing to try Tandy's systems, said Bob Myers, vice
president of Tandy's business products division.
   ``It hasn't proven too difficult to have most of them take a
unit for evaluation,'' Myers said. ``If we can get them to compare
our systems with IBM's, we compare very favorably.''
   Some analysts say there is a perception in corporate America
that Tandy lacks equipment to connect its computers to each other.
   ``In the very large corporate market, connectivity becomes a
very large issue,'' said Joe Cross, an analyst with Future
Computing. ``When you think of networking or office integration,
Tandy is not the first name that pops to mind.''
   Last month Tandy announced plans to license its DeskMate
interface to software developers, hoping to establish the look and
feel of its personal computer screen as an industry standard. It
said its computers can be easily hooked together in networks.
   But Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
New York, said he thinks Tandy's problem has more to do with
marketing than technology.
   ``Everything that's available in networking, Tandy has access
to. Tandy has systems as good as any out there, but it needs to
convince the large companies that it has quality products to
offer,'' he said.
   ``Selling connected solutions in the next couple of years will
be our thrust,'' said John Roach, Tandy's chairman and chief
executive, noting the company's sales force has been successful in
other areas.
   Sales at recently refurbished stores have risen about 4 percent
faster than sales at stores that have not been refurbished, the
company reported.
   Overall Tandy sales, meanwhile, improved to $3.66 billion in
calendar year 1987, compared with $3.32 billion in 1986, and net
income in 1987 improved to $289.8 million, compared with $216.4
million in 1986.
   Company executives also believe Fortune 500 companies, concerned
about quality and value, will look at Tandy products on an equal
footing with other computer systems.
   ``The problem is simply one of penetration and presence,''
Future Computing's Cross said. ``IBM, when it came out with a
personal computer, already had contacts with every company in the
country with its mainframes.''
   Industry rumors have it that Tandy plans this month to unveil
the first computer compatible with IBM's Personal System-2
computer, which was introduced in April 1987.
   Juge won't confirm or deny the rumor. The company has called a
news conference for April 21 to introduce two products _ one a
computer product and the other, ``an invention that will have
impact on multiple areas in the electronics field.''
   Roach said Tandy waited to introduce high-end personal computers
rather than put an inferior product on the market.
   ``We have a very broad-based distribution network and many
repeat customers,'' he said. ``Often we will elect not to carry a
product because we feel like some percentage of the market will not
be happy with it.''
   Tandy also has begun fighting for a share of the market in
portable laptop computers that can perform many of the same
functions as an IBM-compatible desk unit.
   To help the company compete in the tough laptop market, Tandy
recently purchased Grid Systems Corp. of Fremont, Calif., for $55
million. Grid, which designs, manufactures and markets rugged,
magnesium-cased portable microcomputers, will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Tandy.

<TEXT>
   Corporate raider T. Boone Pickens may not
have hit pay dirt when prospecting for targets among gold
companies, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's lost his Midas
touch.
   Last month, Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership ditched its bid
for Homestake Mining Co. after the company rejected a $1.88 billion
buyout offer. An earlier Pickens-led run for Newmont Mining Corp.
also failed to pan out.
   ``The environment for takeovers and some of the rules have
changed, but don't ever shortchange this guy,'' Bob Hill, vice
president for A.G. Edwards in Amarillo, said of Pickens. ``He's
plenty savvy.''
   That savvy helped Pickens parlay a $2,500 investment into one of
the nation's largest independent oil companies. It also earned the
takeover artist who champions shareholder rights a reputation for
making top executives squirm in their boardroom swivel chairs.
   ``Chief executives, who themselves own few shares of their
companies, have no more feeling for the average shareholder than
they do for baboons in Africa,'' Pickens once said.
   But executives aren't the only people who bristle at Pickens.
Residents here sometimes dislike Pickens' dealings in his hometown,
where his moniker is ``Attila of Amarilla.''
   Pickens was a behind-the-scenes mover in a group attacking the
Amarillo Globe-News for negative coverage. After the group rallied
and pulled advertising from the paper last autumn, the newspaper's
general manager, Jerry Huff, announced his departure.
   Pickens' forces celebrated their victory by draping a yellow
banner that read ``Goodbye Jerry'' on the side of Mesa's downtown
building.
   Pickens' multimillion-dollar endowment to West Texas State
University's business school and position as board of regents
chairman haven't won him many friends at the Canyon college, either.
   Some students and faculty have called for the ouster of
president Ed Roach, a Pickens candidate, and of Pickens himself.
The two have been lampooned repeatedly in an underground newsletter
published by faculty members.
   After the newspaper controversy and amid unrest at WTSU, reports
surfaced that Pickens may move his $315.3 million company from this
Panhandle city of 195,000 to a larger Texas city.
   Pickens' right-hand man, David Batchelder, announced last week
he is making his own move: to California, where he will start his
own consulting firm.
   ``It's a significant sacrifice to live in Amarillo,'' Batchelder
told the Wall Street Journal, comparing the city to ``a large truck
stop.''
   Analysts, meanwhile, say that although the 59-year-old Pickens
hasn't made stock market killings on the order of those past, he
hasn't lost his touch.
   ``Most of these (recent takeover attempts) for one reason or
another have been unsuccessful, and that has I think created this
image of Mesa and Boone Pickens being unsuccessful investors,''
said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. vice president Philip Kehl, who
estimated Mesa racked up $10 million in market profits last year.
   ``But I think they've had a lot of small, nice gains which over
the course of time will add up,'' he said.
   Both Pickens and Batchelder failed to return more than a dozen
telephone calls from The Associated Press.
   Nevertheless, Pickens' 1987 dealings pale in comparison to his
earlier conquests in the oil industry.
   In 1982 he reaped $31.5 million for Mesa after launching an
attack on Cities Service Co. that resulted in a buyout by
Occidental Petroleum Corp. He followed that with a string of
unsuccessful but profitable bids for Gulf Oil Corp., from which he
gleaned more than $500 million; Phillips Petroleum Co. and Unocal
Corp.
   Pickens' 1986 bid for Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp. forced
a drastic restructuring of the company, splitting it into a
refining and marketing company, Diamond Shamrock R&M, and an
exploration company, Maxus Energy Corp. Pickens and Mesa still made
several million dollars on that deal.
   Last year, Ivanhoe Partners, a Pickens-led investment group,
made a $2 billion hostile bid to control New York-based Newmont
Mining, a gold and uranium mining concern with interests in oil and
natural gas.
   A Delaware court thwarted the bid when it refused to rule
illegal a ``market sweep'' in which Newmont's biggest shareholder,
Britain's Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, bought enough shares in a
two-day September binge to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent
of Newmont and stave off the hostile bid.
   San Francisco's Homestake, one of the country's largest gold
producers, recently rejected Mesa's offer to negotiate a buyout for
$20 a share in cash.
   ``Admittedly, he hasn't made a major killing in the stock market
since Phillips, but they (Mesa) have been very active investors,''
Kehl said. ``Mesa is sort of two companies _ it's a gas producer
and it's an investment company, and they've been in and out of many
different stocks in the last year.''
   Among his ongoing interests, Pickens has thrice tried to buy KN
Energy Inc., a Lakewood, Colo., gas pipeline company, and he could
take an active role in New Jersey-based Singer Corp., the former
sewing machine maker-turned-defense electronics firm.
   Mesa helped finance corporate raider Paul Bilzerian's post-crash
takeover of Singer by chipping in the last $150 million needed for
the buyout. Fortune magazine reported that Pickens' conditions
dictate that Bilzerian must repay Mesa within 15 months or Pickens
may take control of Singer's board.
   Analysts say Mesa's investments in Singer and other companies
have enhanced the limited partnership's financial picture, but Mesa
may be stretching to pay its cash distributions this month.
   Mesa's dividends have exceeded its operating cash flow, with the
difference coming from the partnership's sizable investment
holdings and lines of credit, Kehl said.
   But other analysts say that cash distributions may be cut soon
to ease the burden for Mesa, which had 1987 earnings of $31.9
million, down 12 percent from 1986, on revenues of $315.3 million.
   While Pickens is still acknowledged as a wily investor,
companies have learned to fight back, and market conditions have
become tougher for speculators like Pickens, market experts contend.
   ``After the stock market broke, the stock market players began
to realize that you can win _ and lose _ at this game,'' said
Warren Shimmerlik, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co.

<HEAD>New Orleans Is Popping With Shopping Malls, Despite Oil Bust</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>

   Boom times went bust here in the 1980s, yet
glitzy, upscale shopping malls keep popping up along the
Mississippi River, in the suburbs and in the shadow of the
Louisiana Superdome.
   Some might say it's crazy to build retail developments in a city
going through a slump often compared to the Great Depression. But
Charles Peterson says its good business.
   Peterson is the regional development director for the Edward J.
DeBartolo Corp., which is building the 8,000-square-foot, $100
million complex that will open next to the Superdome in August.
   It will compete for attention with the new Galleria in suburban
Metairie, the year-old Riverwalk on the riverside site of the 1984
world's fair, Canal Place at the foot of the city's major
thoroughfare and at least five other shopping developments that
have been constructed or expanded in the area since 1980.
   Peterson said the failure of the oil economy in Louisiana, which
hit just as DeBartolo's New Orleans Centre was being planned, did
not give his company second thoughts about the project.
   ``Frankly this has seemed like a very solid idea all along. We
have a great location, and we're bringing in Macy's and Lord &
Taylor, two stores that people from this area have always traveled
to other cities to shop in,'' Peterson said.
   For years, New Orleans residents planned trips to Houston,
Atlanta, New York, and other cities to shop, according to Stella
Schramm, the director of the Chamber of Commerce's economic
development department.
   ``New Orleans was grossly under-retailed in the past,'' she
explained. ``In 1980, our per-capita income surpassed the national
average. That sent up a red flag that got a lot of attention from
national retailers who had previously ignored New Orleans.''
   As retailers began to plan and build new shopping facilities in
the area, however, the oil-based economy began to falter. The price
of oil plummeted, oil-related businesses failed, and Louisiana's
unemployment rate soared above 14 percent.
   In 1985, when the first phase of the Esplanade Mall opened, the
economy was still in good shape. But by the time the second phase
opened in 1986, mall general manager Andre Grondin said things had
changed radically.
   ``I wondered for a while if I'd be looking for another job
myself,'' he said. ``We had a slow period, which is normal for a
new mall, but I was reading all the negative economic news in the
papers at that time, and I was worried.''
   Mall managers and developers remain resolutely confident,
however. While the local economy is still slow, most feel there are
definite signs of recovery.
   ``The important thing about economic forecasts,'' Schramm said,
``is expectation. Expectation was very bad while oil prices were
fluctuating. Now that they're fairly stable, even though they're
not as high as people would like, things are improving.''
   Another factor that's helping the local economy is tourism, and
for the new shopping centers in the area, that's a two-way street.
   ``Definitely. We see people making trips here just to shop,''
Beverly Gianna of the Greater New Orleans Tourist and Convention
Commission said. ``We also see the effect of the new shopping
opportunities on our convention trade. New Orleans is now No. 1 for
spouse attendance at conventions in the United States. I'm sure
having all these great stores is one reason for that.''
   Peterson agrees, saying now that national merchants are opening
here, local folks are shopping at home, and tourists are in those
same stores.
   ``That's not only keeping that money in the local economy, it's
bringing it into the city from other areas. Let's face it, if you
live in Jackson, Miss., or Pensacola, Fla., and you have a chance
to go to Houston or New Orleans for a weekend of shopping, it's an
easy choice. New Orleans can now offer both the French Quarter and
the stores people want. Where do you think people are going to be
going?''

   Grain and soybean futures prices weakened this
morning after a sharp rally in beans Monday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Prices were undermined partly by an increased movement of corn
and soybeans out of country storage, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst
with G.H. Miller & Co.
   Wheat futures were lower, too, despite improved export news,
including an Agriculture Department announcement that it had
targeted the Soviet Union for 1 million tons of subsidized wheat.
   While soybeans were on the retreat, losses were limited by new
estimates that Brazil's bean crop will not be as large as
previously been expected, said Gidel.
   On the opening, wheat was \ cent to } cent lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $2.99{ a bushel; corn was } cent to
1\ cents lower with May at $2.07} a bushel; oats were { cent lower
with May at $1.63{ a bushel; and soybeans were 1{ cents to 2{ cents
lower with May at $6.66\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .37 cent lower to .70 cent higher with the
April contract at 73.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged
to .85 cent lower with April at 79.20 cents a pound; live hogs were
.15 cent lower to .35 cent higher with April at 45.25 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies were .18 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with May at 54.82 cents a pound.
   On Monday, cattle futures were lower, pork bellies were mostly
lower and hogs were mostly higher.

   The Serious Fraud Office, the government's new
weapon against big-time fraud, is to take over the investigation
and prosecutions in the Guinness PLC scandal, the office announced
Tuesday.
   The Guinness case previously was being investigated by
Department of Trade and Industry investigators and by Scotland
Yard's fraud squad.
   Six men, including the brewer's former chairman, have been
charged for their part in a scheme to support the company's stock
price during a takeover.
   The office, which launches operations on Wednesday, brings
together the expertise of top lawyers, accountants and police
officers borrowed from Scotland Yard's and other police
department's fraud squads.

   The stock market moved higher today as a
technical rally took hold, but light volume indicated market
participants may be half-hearted in their enthusiasm for equities.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 13.10 to 1,993.70
at noon on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 13 to 9 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 773 up, 525 down and
52 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 63.78 million shares at midday.
   The Dow pierced the 2,000 mark at midmorning but then met with
considerable resistance.
   ``This is the fourth time in the last week or so that the Dow
has tried to get up above the 2,000 level and has not made it,''
said Ronald F. Daino, a technical analyst at Smith Barney, Harris,
Upham & Co.
   ``The internal market is not showing much enthusiasm,'' he said,
adding that the light volume indicated traders remain cautious.
   The market drew strength from a firming dollar and stabilizing
bond prices, but traders said big institutional investors were not
willing to commit themselves to equities and remain on the
sidelines.
   Analysts expect the Dow to remain in the narrow range, as trader
sentiment swings from recession fears to inflation paranoia.
   Much of the excitement centered on Woolworth, which remains on
the most-active list for a second consecutive day. Woolworth was up
3[ to 57\ after rising 8~ in the previous session when Dart Group
said it was interested in acquiring a stake in the retailer.
   Among other actively traded issues, Lucky Stores, the target of
a takeover bid by American Stores, was up ~ to 48~. International
Business Machines was up [ to 107|, and General Electric was up \
to 40].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.76 to 145.93. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .13 at 295.14.

<TEXT>
   Japan's trade minister told U.S. Ambassador Mike
Mansfield on Tuesday that the Reagan administration should oppose a
bill in Congress that would punish Japan's Toshiba Corp. for its
subsidiary's illegal sale of sensitive machines to the Soviet
Union, an official said.
   Hajime Tamura, minister of international trade and industry,
handed Mansfield a letter to the administration of President Reagan
asking for the elimination of a sanction clause on Toshiba in the
pending trade bill, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Reagan administration officials have said they would recommend
that Reagan veto the trade bill if it includes sanctions on
Toshiba. The bill is working its way through a conference committee
of the House and Senate.
   The official said Tamura expressed concern that the American
sanction would run counter to a basic principle of the Coordinating
Committee for Exports to Communist nations, and that it would hurt
that group's unity.
   Under the rules of COCOM, the Western body that monitors sales
of strategic items to communist nations, effective enforcement of
export controls is the responsibility of each member nation.
   The official quoted Mansfield as saying the U.S. government
opposes using a trade bill to punish a parent company of a business
that violates the agreement.
   Toshiba Machine Co., a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp., Japan's
second largest electronics company, is accused of selling
sophisticated machines to the Soviets illegally between 1982 and
1984. U.S. officials have said the machines might have permitted
Moscow to turn out propellers that could make submarines quieter
and harder to detect.

<TEXT>
   A New York investment firm said Tuesday that it
has obtained all the commitments necessary to finance its $1.14
billion bid for the textile giant J.P. Stevens & Co.
   The firm Odyssey Partners has a $64-a-share tender offer in
progress for all of Stevens' 17.8 million shares. The offer expires
April 11.
   Another textile company, West Point-Pepperell Inc. of West
Point, Ga., also has a tender offer underway for all of Stevens'
stock at $62.50 a share.
   Pepperell launched its tender offer March 24, after the Neevens had
reached an agreement with Odyssey on a
buyout at $61.w
York-based St50 a share.
   Odyssey subsequently sweetened its bid to $64 a share and
Stevens' board agreed to pay Odyssey up to $8 million if the
textile concern is acquired by a third party for more than $64 a
share.
   West Point-Pepperell has indicated it might be willing to
increase its offer to $64 a share if Stevens agreed to a friendly
deal, but has made no move to do so. It had no comment on Odyssey's
financing announcement.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens was unchanged
at $64.62{ a share at midafternoon.
   In Tuesday's announcement, Odyssey said it has obtained a
commitment from Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. which said it
would raise $625 million through the private placement of debt andAttack

<BYLINE>Icahn Files Appeal of Texaco Reorganization Plan</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate raider Carl C. Icahn has
filed an appeal of a federal bankruptcy judge's approval of
Texaco's reorganization plan.
   But Texaco attorney Harvey Miller said the filing, done late
Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, will not stop the $5.6
billion plan, set to begin Thursday.
   Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, said he still opposed to
two key parts of the plan.
   One was the release from any legal liabilities of all the
participants in Texaco's ill-fated 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co.
   He also opposed a default provision in a loan of up to $3
billion which Texaco will use to help fund the reorganization.
   Under a provision of Texaco's agreement with a consortium of
banks providing the money, the loans would be callable if more than
half of its 14-member board is replaced by new directors, or if an
investor obtains 30 percent of the company's stock.
   Two-thirds of the banks must vote to force Texaco to pay back
the money, however.
   Texaco entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 12 last
year, claiming it was forced to do so to avoid having to pay a
potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond while
appealing a $10.3 billion judgment held against it by Pennzoil Co.
   Houston-based Pennzoil won the judgment when a Houston jury
ruled that Texaco had improperly interfered with a Pennzoil attempt
to acquire part of Getty Oil Co. and bought Getty itself.

<HEAD>Reorganization Plan for First City Vital for Its Survival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1.5 billion reorganization plan for troubled
First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc. is crucial to the company's
survival, documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission indicate.
   The bailout plan is being held up by debt-holders who are
refusing to tender their securities for less than face value. First
City has extended its tendering deadline for a fourth time and
lowered the participation level from 90 percent to 70 percent.
   First City's board of directors are convinced that the company
has no realistic alternative to the reorganization, and that the
plan's failure would eventually mean the bank's failure.
   In an accompanying letter to the SEC, the accounting firm of
Arthur Andersen & Co. said First City's operating losses for 1987
and 1988 have continued, credit quality has deteriorated and that
the bank has borrowed substantially from the Federal Reserve Bank
of Dallas.
   ``If the reorganization is not successfully completed, these
factors, among others, will create a substantial doubt about the
company's ability to continue in existence,'' the letter said.
   Houston-based First City also reported in the company's 10K
report with the SEC last week that it expects a $43 million loss by
the time the reorganization plan is completed.
   The expected loss in 1988 represents a continuing deterioration
of First City's loan portfolio, plus operating losses and
non-recurring charges related to the federally assisted rescue plan.
   In the first quarter of 1987, First City recorded a loss of
$44.5 million, and it lost $232.4 million during the same quarter
in 1986. For all of 1987, the company posted a loss of $1.13
billion, compared to a loss of $402 million in 1986.
   First City had forecast a $1.1 billion loss for 1987, based on
an expected $852 million fourth-quarter deficit. But the company's
fourth-quarter loss rose to $861 million.
   First City, with 59 banks in Texas and one in South Dakota, grew
quickly during the Texas oil boom, but was hammered by energy and
real estate losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company
posted a $1.1 billion loss.
   The bailout plan for Texas' fourth-largest bank-holding company
calls for $970 million in assistance from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., $500 million infusion of capital raised privately
by a group headed by Chicago investor A. Robert Abboud, who would
become chairman under the plan, and a spinoff of $1.79 billion in
book value of poorly performing assets.
   First City extended its deadline for the tender offer until
April 12 after only 62 percent, or $140 million, of the bank's
$225.8 million in bonds had been tendered by March 29.
   Under the arrangement, First City debt holders have been offered
45 cents on the dollar for their debt, while subordinated debt
holders have been offered 35 cents.

   Continental Airlines announced today a ``spring
sale'' on some tickets for travel between April 18 and June 15,
with no one-way fare greater than $99 for travel anywhere in the
mainland United States.
   The cuts of as much as 36 percent apply only to ``MaxSaver''
discount fares, the airline's cheapest fares which carry
restrictions. Tickets must be purchased in the next nine days.
   One-way sale fares to Honolulu will be $149 from Denver, Los
Angeles and San Francisco, and $199 from Newark, N.J., Cleveland,
Chicago and Houston.
   Tickets must be bought between April 6 and April 14 and some
restrictions apply.
   ``With our recent realignment of unrestricted fares, we've made
a commitment to keep prices affordable for the discretionary
traveler,'' said Doug Birdsall, the airline's senior vice president
of marketing and planning. ``The $99 transcontinental fare is a
fare the consumer knows, understands and responds to en masse,'' he
said.
   The fares are good for travel between noon Monday and noon
Thursday.

   Corning Glass Works said Tuesday its profit
fell 17.4 percent in the first quarter compared with results a year
ago that had included a one-time gain stemming from an accounting
change.
   For the quarter ended March 27, Corning reported a profit of
$37.1 million or 83 cents a share, compared with earnings of $44.9
million, or 97 cents a share, for the same quarter in 1987.
   Sales for the quarter rose 3 percent to $462.6 million $448.5
millipon a year earlier.
   The results a year ago included a gain of $14.2 million from a
change in accounting for certain manufacturing costs over a period
of years.
   Without that benefit, Corning said its first-quarter earnings
for 1988 would have risen 21 percent from last year's results.
   Corning manufactures consumer housewares, automobile pollution
control devices, fiber optics and specialty glass and ceramics. It
also operates a network of clinical testing labs.
   It was recently dropped its effort to expand that network by
acquiring International Clinical Laboratories Inc. of Nashville,
Tenn.
   Corning had bid $35 per share, or $360 million, for the
Tennessee company, but wound up selling its stake in the concern to
pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beckman Corp. which bid $37 a
share, or about $400 million.

   The stock market reversed an early technical
rally today, but light volume indicated the downturn was far from
dramatic.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen as much
as 20 points earlier in the session, was up 0.34 to 1,980.94 at 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 726 down, 669 up and
501 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 95.25 million shares at
midafternoon.
   The Dow pierced the 2,000 mark at midmorning but then met with
considerable resistance. Traders said the downturn mirrored a
similar move southward in the bond market.
   ``The intraday sentiment on interest rates can move this market
as much as 10 or 15 points,'' said Peter Vandenberg, vice president
of trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Market watchers were reluctant to draw firm conclusions because
trading volume was very light. ``The volume is not such that this
is a dramatic move in the market,'' Vandenberg said.
   Some speculated that big institutional investors were not
willing to commit themselves to equities and instead remained on
the sidelines.
   ``The internal market is not showing much enthusiasm,'' said
Ronald F. Daino, a technical analyst at Smith Barney, Harris, Upham
& Co.
   Much of the excitement centered on Woolworth, a component of the
Dow average, which remains on the most-active list for a second
consecutive day. But after rising as much as 4 earlier in the
session, Woolworth was up just 1] to 55{ at midafternoon.
   ``Woolworth took some fluff out of the market,'' Vandenberg
said. On Monday Woolworth jumped 8~ when Dart Group said it was
interested in acquiring a stake in the retailer.

<HEAD>Giant Sara Lee Buys Interest In Baltimore Sausage Maker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sara Lee Corp. recently acquired a 45 percent
stake in the privately held Parks Sausage Co., one of Baltimore's
most successful minority-owned businesses, executives of both
companies say.
   The deal was completed about seven weeks ago. Details were not
disclosed.
   Parks had 1987 revenues of more than $25 million with a
workforce of about 200.
   Last year the company agreed to move its plant from the current
downtown site to an industrial park to help make room for the
proposed Camden Yards stadium project.
   According to a city official quoted in Tuesday's Daily Record,
Sara Lee had entered into negotraitions with Parks before the
city's relocation discussions started. Sara Lee will help finance
the relocation, the official said.
   Sara Lee is a Chicago-based consumer goods conglomerate with
1987 sales of $9.15 billion. Its consumer foods division includes
several well-known brands, such as Jimmy Dean Meats and Hillshire
Farm.
   Other Sara Lee divisions include personal and household care
products, vacuum cleaners and food service distribution. Among its
better-known holdings are Hanes Hosiery and The Coach Stores.
   Sara Lee spokesman Steve Savage said the company acquired
several sausage makers in the last year and plans to expand further.

<HEAD>Placement Pro Says It's a Tough Year for College Grads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New college graduates this spring will face a
tight job market, with competition-conscious companies less willing
to offer extended on-the-job training, a veteran placement
professional says.
   ``Employers, especially small- and medium-size companies which
represent the areas of greatest job growth, today have neither the
time nor inclination to `bring somebody along' gradually,'' said
James E. Challenger, president of Chicago-based Challenger, Gray &
Christmas Inc., which descibes itself as the nation's oldest
outplacement firm. ``Now, you either sink or swim, right away.''
   An increasingly competitive marketplace is facing all companies,
Challenger said in an analysis of the 1988 college graduate job
outlook, released Monday.
   ``As a result, many of the larger firms have instituted
corporate downsizing to pare their overhead and operating expenses,
which has not only eliminated or combined many existing jobs but
also prevented the creation of many new entry-level jobs.
   ``The two-year training programs for beginners are among
casualties of world market competition,'' he said. ``Companies want
results now, not in two years.''
   Challenger, 62, founded his firm in 1962 and says it has helped
more than 20,000 people who have lost jobs find employment. The
firm has 14 regional offices in cities including Los Angeles,
Boston, Dallas and Milwaukee.
   Challenger said the job market won't favor most graduates
because companies are more selective. He said early indications
suggest that fewer than the usual one-third of students getting
four-year degrees will have jobs lined up when they receive
diplomas.
   College placement officials say that just 20 percent to 25
percent of students graduating have jobs set, but things could
change by the end of May, Challenger said in a telephone interview.
   The graduates likely to have the most luck finding positions are
``the A students and those with specialty degrees such as
engineering or accounting,'' or those going into sales, Challenger
said.
   ``Companies are always willing to take on sales trainees''
because many sales jobs are low-salary or operate on commission, he
said.
   Some students are taking unpaid internships to obtain good jobs,
Challenger said. Others may have to take part-time work as they
search for permanent positions.
   Some placement experts disagree with Challenger's assessment.
Victor Lindquist, director of placement for Northwestern University
in Evanston, said his survey of employers indicates a better
employment year spring graduates.
   He said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the university's
survey last fall forecast a 10 percent increase in new-graduate
employment over the previous year.
   Lindquist agreed that takeovers and corporate restructurings
have heightened competition for new jobs.
   ``If you were making $35,000 and you're offered $30,000 you
might not like it, but it's better than unemployment,'' said
Lindquist.
   But at the same time, he said, many companies ``are very, very
heavily in the market (for new employees) and have made a big
commitment to training.
   ``Not having a job by commencement is not necessarily the end of
the world,'' Lindquist said. ``There'll be more kids hired in June,
July, August and September than there probably were in the previous
four months. And there's nothing at all unusual about that.''

   Wheat futures rallied sharply and most other
grain and soybean contracts also were higher Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Wheat showed a little early enthusiasm, reflecting coming export
business and an Agriculture Department announcement that it is
targeting the Soviet Union for 1 million tons of subsidized wheat,
said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller & Co.
   But the market took a sharp turn upward when a professional fund
manager bought a huge amount of wheat.
   ``They probably bought a total of 20 million bushels,'' said
Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. ``They
apparently were trying to get a positive trend going.''
   Analyst said there was no fundamental news to justify the
dime-a-bushel advance in wheat. Prices were trimmed a bit in late
dealings.
   At the close, wheat was 6} cents to 8} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.07 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to 1{ cents higher with May at $2.08{ a bushel; oats were {

   The stock market was slightly higher after
slipping from an early technical rally today, but light volume
indicated traders were short on conviction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen as much
as 20 points earlier in the session, was up 5.97 to 1,986.57 at 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers by about 10 to 9 in the

   The Dow pierced the 2,000 mark at midmorning but then met with
considerable resistance as traders cashed in on the short-term
upswing.
   ``This is fourth time the Dow has tried to get up over 2,000 in
last week or so and has not made it,'' said Ronald F. Daino, a
technical analyst at Smith Barney, Harris, Upham & Co. ``The
internal market is not showing much enthusiasm.''
   Market watchers were reluctant to draw firm conclusions because
trading volume remained very light.
   Some speculated that big institutional investors were not
willing to commit themselves to equities and instead remained on
the sidelines.
   ``This is one of those low-conviction markets where traders

said Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.
   Despite a firming dollar and stabilizing bond prices, Metz said
it will take ``some passage of time'' for these improved
fundamentals to trigger investment interest.
   Much of the excitement centered on Woolworth, a component of the

   The stock market finished higher today after
seesawing in directionless trading that was marked by low volume
and caution among market participants.
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 20 points in an
early technical rally, then dipped into negative territory before
rising again. Analysts noted that traders were quick to cash in on
the initial upswing.
   Market watchers were reluctant to draw conclusions because
trading volume remained light.
   Despite a firming dollar and stabilizing bond prices, there was
``a lack of strong fundamentals to provide clear direction to
sustain a move in either direction,'' said Hugh Johnson, a senior
vice president at First Albany Corp.
   Analysts said traders were the main players in the market, with
individual and institutional investors remaining on the sidelines
while awaiting clearer signals on the direction of the economy.
   ``This is one of those low-conviction markets where traders
dominate the arena'' and are influenced by ``intraday stimuli,''
said Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.
   Investors are groping for ``more direction in terms of (Federal
Reserve) policy and the economic indicators,'' Johnson said.

   The dollar surged higher against major foreign
currencies Tuesday as traders decided Japanese investors were
unlikely to unload dollars.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
was bid at $452.65 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $455.85
late Monday.
   The dollar climbed about 1 percent against the West German mark,
British pound and Japanese yen.
   The U.S. currency's strength prompted people who had been
betting on a dollar decline to retreat by buying dollars to cover
short positions. That contributed to the dollar's rally.
   The dollar had been depressed in March by fears that Japanese
trust funds and securities firms would lighten their dollar
holdings starting April 1 because they would no longer need to
support it for accounting purposes.
   When Japanese dollar-selling failed to materialize, investors
took courage, said Charles A. Spence, vice president of foreign
exchange at First Interstate Bank of California in Los Angeles.
   Dollar buyers were also encouraged by news reports that Federal
Reserve Governor Wayne Angell expressed a strong desire to lower
inflation, said Peter Gloyne, senior trader at First National Bank
of Chicago.
   If the Fed tried to combat inflation through higher interest
rates, it would raise the yield of dollar-denominated securities
and make foreigners want to buy dollars.
   Interest rates finished Tuesday little changed.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.58 yen to a close at 124.43 yen, compared with 123.85
on Monday. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 125.15 yen.
At the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar was quoted at
125.28 yen, up from 124.18 yen late Monday. In London, the British
pound fell to $1.8800 from $1.8895 on Good Friday. Later in New
York, the pound fell to $1.8790 from $1.8857 late Monday.
   There was spotty foreign-exchange trading in Europe on Friday
but no precious metals trading. The European financial markets were
closed on Monday for the Easter holiday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's
rates, were: 1.6706 West German marks, up from 1.6540; 1.3769 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3639; 1.2418 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2370;
5.6645 French francs, up from 5.6085; and 1,237.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,227.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday's rates:
1.6690 West German marks, up from 1.6565; 1.3765 Swiss francs, up
from 1.3635; 5.6605 French francs, up from 5.6270; 1.8700 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8595; 1,234.50 Italian lire, up from 1,228.75;
1.2395 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2335.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was bid at $453.40 a troy ounce, down from $456.70 late
Monday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $451.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $454.50. In Zurich, gold fell,
closing at a bid $453.50 an ounce compared with $457.50 late
Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold markets were closed because of a public
holiday.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery was bid
at $6.65 an ounce, down from $6.789 an ounce late Monday. Silver
bullion prices fell on the London market, where the metal was
trading at a late bid price of $6.65 a troy ounce, compared with
Thursday's $6.72.

<TEXT>
   Two units of fare-wars veteran Texas Air Corp. fired a spring
salvo Tuesday by announcing price cuts on tickets purchased by
April 14.
   The subsidiaries, Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines, may
touch off a price skirmish only a few weeks after all the major
carriers hiked fares steeply.
   But the cuts _ limited by the purchase-period requirements and
hemmed in by other restrictions _ stop short of a full-fledged
price war. Although observers believe the reductions made by
Miami-based Eastern and Houston-based Continental are likely to be
matched by other major airlines, they don't see a major fare battle
on the horizon.
   ``It's definitely not a fare war; it's barely a skirmish,'' said
Edward Starkman, an airline analyst for investment firm PaineWebber
Inc.
   If anything, the current climate for the industry appears to
favor fare hikes rather than reductions. The major U.S. carriers
have posted an average increase in passenger traffic of 7 percent
to 8 percent since New Year's Day from the same period last year.
   The robust demand prompted the big airlines to raise their
first-class, economy and discount fares in mid-March by 15 percent
to 85 percent, depending on the destination. The carriers also
tightened restrictions on their popular ``MaxSaver'' discount
fares, the cheapest available.
   The big fare hikes came several weeks before they normally do,
as the airlines jumped the gun on the peak travel season that
starts in April.
   Eastern and Continental, the nation's sixth-largest and
fifth-ranked airlines, respectively, said Tuesday they were cutting
some fares in anticipation of a slack period coming up for leisure
travel.
   ``The period between Easter and the start of summer vacations in
mid-June is always a slack travel time, and an early Easter extends
the off-peak period this year,'' said George J. Brennan, vice
president of marketing communications for Eastern.
   ``We hope to give leisure travel a boost with fares so low that
people will take a trip they might not otherwise plan.''
   With the new fares, the airline said, passengers will be able to
fly midweek to more than 80 U.S. cities on Eastern for a maximum of
$99 one way (based on a round-trip tariff of $198). Eastern's
round-trip fare between Miami and New York, for example, will fall
to $178 under the program, compared with the current ``MaxSaver''
fare of $208.
   Although there are some minor differences, Eastern and
Continental introduced similar programs. The non-refundable tickets
must be purchased by April 14 (starting Tuesday for Eastern and
Wednesday for Continental), and used for travel from April 18
through June 15.
   Passengers must travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday.
Round-trip travel and a Saturday night stay are required.
   Those restrictions limit the program to eight travel days in
April, 18 days in May and nine in June.
   And there are still more restrictions. For Eastern, tickets must
be bought within 24 hours after making reservations. Continental is
even stricter: It requires reservations and ticketing to be done at
the same time.
   Both airlines prohibit schedule changes to be made the special
fares and limit the number of available seats on each flight.
   ``It's pretty savvy of Texas Air Corp.,'' said Andrew Geller, a
transportation analyst for Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
``It very effectively cancels out every businessperson'' from using
the new fares.
   Geller suggested that the reduced tariffs could encourage people
who had planned vacations to take them within the specified time
frames.

   American Honda Motor Co. Inc. said Tuesday it
will voluntarily recall about 66,000 1988 Prelude S and Si
automobiles for replacement of power steering hoses.
   The hose can develop a slight leak under prolonged vibration at
engine temperatures, causing smoke if the fluid contacts the hot
exhaust manifold cover and possibly fire if it contacts the
manifold itself, Honda said in a written statement.
   The company said it had no reports of incidents involving such
leaks. Owners of affected vehicles will be notified and improved
hose assemblies will be installed free, the company said.

<HEAD>Hallmark, KC Southern Buy Out Hostile Suitor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York investor Howard Kaskel has sold
his 11.7 percent stake in Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. for
about $77.6 million, getting a hefty premium to terminate his
eight-month takeover attempt.
   The railroad holding company joined with Hallmark Cards Inc. to
acquire stock controlled by an investor group led by Kaskel for $60
a share on Monday, a premium of more than $10.25 a share _ more
than 20 percent _ over the market price at the time.
   Kansas City Southern shares traded at $49.75 at the time the
buyback was disclosed. The stock fell $1.37{ a share on Monday and
dropped another $3.75 to close at $46.50 a share Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Kansas City Southern bought 54 percent of Kaskel's stock, or
694,000 shares, for $41.6 million while Hallmark bought the
remaining 600,600 shares for $36 million.
   Kaskel had proposed a friendly buyout of the Kansas City
Southern shares that his group didn't own for $587.6 million, or
$60 a share. After the company spurned the offer, Kaskel threatened
a proxy battle to name two of his group to the board of directors
at Kansas City Southern's annual meeting May 3.
   Fred Spar, a spokesman for Kaskel, said the investor agreed to
sell because he could not convince Kansas City Southern to accept
his plans for gaining control of the company.
   ``There were several discussions with management, but we came to
the conclusion that we would not be able to go forward on a
friendly basis,'' he said.
   Hallmark's purchase will make it Kansas City Southern's largest
stockholder, with 1.04 million shares, or 9.4 percent of those
outstanding. The Kansas City-based greeting card giant said it
liked Kansas City Southern's long-term prospects and did not plan
to take control.
   Hallmark previously owned 4 percent of Kansas City Southern's
stock. Irvine O. Hockaday Jr., president and chief executive
officer of Hallmark, held a smiliar post at Kansas City Southern
from 1981 until 1983.
   Jim Wineland, a stock analyst with Waddell & Reed Inc., said the
premium price paid to Kaskel reflected the threat he posed to the
company.
   ``It's called greenmail. Just on the face, you'd have to say it
was worth that much to get Kaskel out of the way,'' Wineland said.
   Jeffrey Perry, of the investment firm C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc. in New York, called the deal ``the most blatant case
of greenmail I've seen in a long time.'' He said the price Hallmark
paid for the stock was not justified by Kansas City Southern's
expected earnings.
   KCSI's main holding is the Kansas City Southern Lines, the
nation's 14th largest railroad. It also owns 87.3 percent of DST
Systems, Inc., a financial record keeper based in Kansas City,
where it and affiliated operations employ about 2,000 people.

   Energy futures retreated Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, depressed by what are regarded as OPEC's ineffectual
moves to stabilize the market.
   Among other commodities, precious metals declined, wheat futures
rallied sharply and livestock closed on a firm note.
   The oil market had a case of the jitters over a planned meeting
Saturday by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
pricing committee.
   Nauman Barakat, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co., said their had been speculation early in the day that
the meeting would be called off.
   This was quickly denied, but the reaffirmation that the meeting
was on didn't seem to put much inspiration into the market.
   ``Obviously if the meeting is not on, this would be more
negative for the market. But the bottom line is what the meeting
will accomplish _ essentially nothing but propaganda,'' said
Barakat. ``The perception is that whether the meeting is on or not,
it's not really going to accomplish anything.''
   He said the OPEC committee probably will probably end up blaming
non-OPEC producers for the turmoil in the market, rather than
making any moves to bring some firmness to prices.
   ``It'll take a little more than that to bring some stability,''
he said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 14 cents to 22 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in May at $16.79 a barrel; heating
oil was .36 cent to .80 cent lower with May at 45.20 cents a
gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .60 cent to .71 cent lower with
May at 48.64 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals prices gave back Monday's gains and then some on
the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Events of the day ``defused inflationary expectations,'' said
Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   The market weakened early on the strength of the dollar, she
said.
   ``Then,'' she said, ``(Federal Reserve governor) Wayne Angell
talked about last week's favorable unemployment data not really
being that inflationary. And he felt inflation should be lower.''
   Angell referred to data released Friday showing the jobless rate
at 5.6 percent, the lowest since 1979.
   Ms. Raptopoulos also noted that lower energy futures and a
weakened CRB Index also pointed toward lower inflation.
   Gold settled $3.30 to $3.60 lower with the June contract at
$456.20 a troy ounce; and silver was 14 cents to 14.6 cents lower
with May at $6.685 a troy ounce.
   Wheat futures rallied sharply and most other grain and soybean
contracts also were higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat showed a little early enthusiasm, reflecting coming export
business and an Agriculture Department announcement that the Soviet
Union was authorized 1 million tons of subsidized wheat, said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller & Co.
   But the market took a sharp turn upward when a professional fund
manager bought a huge amount of wheat.
   ``They probably bought a total of 20 million bushels,'' said
Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. ``They
apparently were trying to get a positive trend going.''
   Wheat settled 6\ cents to 8} cents higher with the May contract
at $3.06{ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
May at $2.08{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 2 cents higher with May
at $1.66 a bushel; and soybeans were 2 cents to 6{ cents higher
with May at $6.70} a bushel.
   Cattle futures recovered from Monday's sharp losses on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc., said trading ``began real nervous,'' opening lower
then falling even more.
   But the downturn didn't take hold and ``the market finished
higher and fairly firm,'' he said.
   Much of Tuesday's selling was profit taking, rather than an
indication of some fundamental weakness in the market, Stanley
added.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .73 cent higher with the
April contract at 73.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with April at 79.55 cents a pound; live
hogs were unchanged to .25 cent higher with April at 45.42 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.80 cents lower to .13 cent
higher with May at 53.20 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 2.55 points higher at 259.50. The underlying spot
index closed 2.42 points higher at 258.51.

   The stock market spun into a late rally Tuesday
after seesawing in a directionless session marked by low volume and
investor caution.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 16.91 points to
1,997.51.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 911 up, 585 down and 467 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 135.29 million shares, against 182.24
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index rose
1.12 to 146.29.
   The Dow average dipped into negative territory at midday as
traders moved to cash in on an early technical rally that pushed
the key index up about 20 points in the first few hours of activity.
   But analysts were reluctant to draw firm conclusions about the
market's overall tone because trading volume remained among the
lightest levels so far this year.
   ``The overriding issue is that the volume is not particularly
convincing, and that's leaving the market fairly directionless,''
said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp.
   Despite a firming dollar and stabilizing bond prices, there was
``a lack of strong fundamentals to sustain a move in either
direction,'' he added.
   Analysts said professional traders were the main players in the
market, with individual and institutional investors remaining on
the sidelines while they await clearer signals on state of the
overall economy.
   Traders are more interested in capitalizing on short-term
movements, while investors typically take a longer-term view of the
market, noted Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.
   ``This is one of those low-conviction markets where traders
dominate the arena,'' he said.
   Much of the session's activity centered on F.W. Woolworth, a
component of the Dow average and the most active issue of the day.
Woolworth finished up 2{ at 56| after jumping 8~ on Monday, when
Dart Group said it was interested in acquiring a stake in the
retailer.
   Woolworth had been up as much as 4 during the session, but fell
back amid profit-taking. Analysts said the stock's movements had a
fairly significant impact on the Dow throughout the day.
   Among other actively traded issues, International Business
Machines was unchanged at 107{; General Electric was up { to 40|,
and Pillsbury rose } to 44{.
   Koppers, the target of a takeover bid from Beazer, fell 1 to 56\.
   Airline issues were mixed amid analysts' speculation that
carriers would move to match lower discount fares announced by
Texas Air's Eastern and Continental units. AMR Corp. fell 1[ to
42[; Delta fell } to 51; Allegis rose ] to 82~ and Pan Am rose [ to
2~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $19.67 billion, or 0.77
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 158.46 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 3.02 to 300.17,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.42 to 258.51.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose .06
to 295.07. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 373.41, up 1.52.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister to Visit Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister will visit Mexico
this week to discuss the international market situation, the
government announced Tuesday.
   A statement from the Energy and Mines Department said the visit
of Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia ``responds to the traditional and
active Mexican policy of dialogue and cooperation with other
producing nations of petroleum, members or not members of OPEC, as
well as with consuming nations.''
   It said such communication ``has the purpose of reconciling
national interests with the development of a stable internaitonal
market with profitable prices, that might allow a more predictable
and consistent evolution of the international market situation.''
   The statement said Nazer would arrive Wednesday and meet
Thursday with President Miguel de la Madrid after first holding
discussions with Energy and Mines Secretary Fernando Hiriart and
with Francisco Rojas, director of the state oil monopoly Pemex.
   Mexico is not a member of the Organization of Oil Exporting
Countries but closely monitors its price and production guidelines.
It was the world's fourth largest oil producer in 1985 but since
has slipped to sixth place behind the Soviet Union, the United
States, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China.
   On Monday night, Pemex announced that it lowered the price of
its light Isthums crude by $1.62 a barrel to Japanese customers in
March.
   Pemex said in a statement that the price of the light oil was
$13.86 a barrel in March, down from $15.48 a barrel in February.
   Japan buys 180,000 barrels a day of crude, accounting for 11
percent of Mexico's total oil exports in March.
