<HEAD>Soviet Emigree Accused Of Being Moscow Spy Goes On Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet emigrant with links to Israeli
politicians and military officers went on trial Monday insisting
his confession of spying for the Soviet Union was obtained under
duress, his lawyer said.
   Shabtai Kalmanovich, 43, was taken into the closed courtroom
under heavy guard. He stopped briefly to embrace his father and
wife who handed him newspapers, cigarettes and a sack of cheese and
lettuce sandwichs.
   Attorney Amnon Zichroni said his client took extensive notes
during the five-hour hearing. He said only one witness testified
Monday, an agent of Shin Bet, Israel's secret service, who helped
obtain Kalmanovich's confession during his eight months in custody.
   ``We are arguing that this confession was not made
voluntarily,'' Zichroni told The Associated Press. ``I am not
permitted ... to give details, but I can say we oppose its
submission.''
   The exact charges Kalmanovich faces have not been revealed. He
is expected to plead innocent after the hearing resumes Thursday.
   Kalmanovich, who emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1971, was
arrested in December. He had established himself in Israel as an
international businessman, an activist in the Labor Party and a
socialite who mixed with leading politicians and senior army
officers.
   Zichroni declined to comment on foreign reports that the Soviet
Union may be working on a deal to trade Kalmanovich in a spy swap
involving Jonathan Jay Pollard, an American convicted of spying for
Israel, and another unidentified American.
   Kalmanovich wore sneakers and was dressed neatly Monday but had
long hair. ``The security men don't take me to the barber,'' he
told reporters.

   A fire Monday near an aquatic park that
boasts ``five million gallons'' burned about 10 acres of brush
before it was extinguished, and destroyed eight cars, authorities
said.
   Firefighters had some difficulty in controlling the fire at
first because ``there's no fire hydrant in the parking lot. We
can't get any water to the cars,'' Los Angeles County fire
Inspector John Lenihan said.
   County fire Capt. Garry Oversby said later that water was
rerouted from hydrants nearby.
   It was not immediately known whether the blaze began in a
vehicle or on the vegetation in Bonnelli Park, but the flames
leaped from car to car, Oversby said.
   The fire was reported shortly after 2 p.m. in an overflow
parking area for Raging Waters amusement park less than one mile
away. The park was not evacuated and no one was injured.
   ``Raging Waters is 44 acres, five million gallons and tons of
fun for everyone,'' said a tape-recorded message at the park, about
25 miles northeast of Los Angeles. The park features 12 water
slides, a fresh-water surf pool, and a river-rafting ride.
   Damage was estimated at $50,000, Oversby said.

<TEXT>
   China's top military official, speaking to
reporters Tuesday before meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, said China is not a major arms dealer.
   ``China is a developing country. China can only sell a little.
It is only a small fraction of what the United States has sold,''
Defense Minister Qin Jiwei said.
   China's sales of missiles to Middle East nations, including
Silkworm missiles to Iran, have been criticized by the United
States.
   According to U.S. figures, China sold about $2 billion worth of
arms last year, mainly to developing countries. China does not
provide information on its arms sales.
   Qin said China and other Third World countries sell only
conventional arms ``but the United States is selling advanced arms
such as the F-16'' jet fighter. ``We can't compare the two kinds of
arms,'' he said.
   Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Xin, also talking to reporters in the
Great Hall of the People, insisted China strictly regulates its
arms sales. ``First, they are for defense. Second, they are for
maintaining stability and peace, not war,'' he said.
   Earlier Tuesday the American national anthem echoed off the gray
walls of the Chinese Military Museum as China's top military
leaders welcomed Carlucci on his first official visit.
   Carlucci, accompanied by Qin, reviewed a 120-member honor guard
from the People's Liberation Army.
   Carlucci arrived Monday for a five-day visit to discuss
international and bilateral issues.
   China is expected to call on the United States to remove
restrictions on technology transfers and approve export licenses
for U.S. companies wanting to use Chinese Long March missiles to
launch satellites.
   Use of the Chinese missiles has been opposed by U.S. defense
officials concerned about giving China access to U.S. satellite
technology.
   Regional conflicts in Afghanistan and Cambodia and the Soviet
military stance in the Far East are also likely to be discussed.

   One person was killed and nine others
aboard a commercial aircraft were injured when the plane crashed
near a mountain lake Monday shortly after takeoff from Sitka, the
Coast Guard said.
   The crash was reported at about 3:35 p.m. near Indigo Lake,
about five to 10 miles east of the Sitka airport, Coast Guard Cmdr.
Bruce Merchant said.
   Merchant said the twin-engine Britten-Norman BN-2 operated by
Wrangell Air Service crashed in a mountainous area at about the
2,000-foot level. Nine passengers and a pilot were on board the
flight from Sitka to Petersburg, he said.
   One person, whose identify was not immediately released, died at
the scene. The other nine were evacuated by helicopters from the
Coast Guard and from Mountain Aviation, a private air service,
Merchant said.
   He said all were taken to hospitals, where two people were in
serious condition. They were to be flown to Seattle for treatment,
Sitka Fire Department Assistant Chief Doug Karpstein said.
   Merchant said the cause of the crash was not immediately known.
The weather at the time was rainy, with clouds at the tops of the
mountains that surround Sitka, he said.

   Fifty people were arrested Monday when a
group trying to distribute free food and leaflets scuffled with
police, who had previously warned the group to get a permit or move
elsewhere.
   A television cameraman was injured when a police officer knocked
him to the ground at the fracas on the edge of Golden Gate Park.
   Food and fists went flying when a squad of police officers
wearing riot gear closed in on about 200 people gathered for the
``Food Not Bombs'' give-away.
   It was the second time in a week the group had clashed with
police. On Aug. 29, 29 people were arrested in a similar
confrontation. Group leaders said they will return each Monday.
   Later Monday in Warwick, Mass., a group active on behalf of the
homeless, the Gandhi Peace Center, gave its annual Marie Antoinette
Award for Community Consciousness to the city of San Francisco to
recognize the arrests. The tongue-in-cheek award refers to the
French queen's famous remark of, ``Let them eat cake,'' when told
the peasants were without bread.
   The latest confrontation took place about 45 minutes after the
group marched into the southeast corner of the park, adjacent to
the Haight-Ashbury district, popular in the 1960s among hippies and
in the '80s among people who buy and restore Victorian homes.
Police moved in as the group's members began giving food to one
another.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Jerry Senkir said it was considered an
illegal give-away after food was given to 25 people.
   As the officers approached, food began to fly through the air.
One officer was hit in the face with a plate of rice and another
was struck in the neck with a tomato.
   A police officer grabbed KPIX cameraman Hank Schoepp, knocking
him to the ground. The cameraman lay stunned for a few moments with
blood trickling from his cheek and his camera tossed aside. He then
got up and resumed filming the clash.
   Some of those arrested were dragged away with their wrists bound
by plastic ties. They were loaded into police vans and taken away.
Senkir said they faced a possible misdemeanor count of creating a
nuisance and two park infractions: illegal distribution of food and
illegal leafleting.
   The park infractions carry a maximum penalty of a $50 fine.
   Senkir said one woman also faced a charge of assaulting an
officer.
   Senkir said the giveaway would not be illegal if the group had
obtained permits. He said the group had been offered other sites
for the give-away, but rejected that idea.
   The group had 15 to 20 cartons of food, including bread,
carrots, lettuce, rice, melons and corn.
   The leaflets said the group had been harassed in recent months
by police and had been unfairly characterized by Mayor Art Agnos as
being interested in exploiting the homeless and hungry.
   Patrisha Vestey, who was handing out deviled eggs, said she was
a legal assistant in a law office and lived in the neighborhood.
``I disapproved of what the police are doing. I think the poor
should be taken care of,'' she said. It was not clear if she was a
member of the group.
   Lorraine Rorke, vice president of Stanyan-Fulton Association,
said, ``I'm against this particular give-away in this particular
location.
   ``I also feel that they are not so interested in giving away
food as they are in promoting their particular message,'' said Ms.
Rorke, whose organization is one of several neighborhood
associations opposed to the ``Food Not Bombs'' give-aways.
   ``It's a free country, and if they want to have their political
views, they can have them. I just don't like their means of using
the hungry and blocking the entrance to the park,'' she said.

   Florida Republicans, with a good shot at gaining a
U.S. Senate seat two years after losing one, will be choosing
between the arch-conservative grandson of a baseball legend and the
brash prosecutor who put a Colombian drug lord behind bars.
   Meantime, six Democrats are battling in their primary, prompted
by the decision of the popular incumbent, Lawton Chiles, not to
seek re-election. An October runoff will be necessary if, as
expected, no one gets more than half the votes on Tuesday.
   Seven of Florida' 19 congressional districts are also holding
primaries.
   Raising funds has been the dominant topic of the Senate races,
two years after then-Gov. Bob Graham unseated Republican Sen. Paula
Hawkins in a race that cost them a combined $13 million.
   Chiles, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, stunned state
politicians with his decision in December not to seek a fourth
term. Chiles said he was burned out by his Senate workload and the
high cost of campaigns.
   Rep. Connie Mack III, a three-term Republican, had already begun
piling up funds when Chiles dropped out. Mack, whose late
grandfather managed the Philadelphia A's and is in Baseball's Hall
of Fame, has spent at least $2.2 million so far.
   Democrats were pleased when former Gov. Reubin Askew announced
his candidacy. But Askew, though running well ahead of Mack in the
polls, abruptly quit May 7, saying he didn't like all the time
spent raising funds.
   Askew's withdrawal left Rep. Dan Mica the only Democrat to
oppose Mack. But quickly, five others entered the race: three-term
state Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter, Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy''
MacKay, state Sen. Patricia Frank, former Republican Gov. Claude
Kirk and former Senate postal clerk Fred Rader.
   Mack got a surprise of his own when Robert Merkle, fresh from
gaining the conviction of Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder
Rivas, quit as U.S. attorney and entered the Republican race in
June.
   President Reagan and former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North made
campaign appearances for Mack, a 47-year-old with one of the most
conservative records in Congress.
   The outspoken Merkle, also a conservative, has likened Mack to a
``shiny new car'' with ``no engine under the hood.'' When Mack
refused to debate him, Merkle started carrying around a life-sized
replica of Mack he called ``Cardboard Connie.''
   However, he did not make an issue of Mack's admission last year
that he had used marijuana in his younger days.
   Merkle, 43, has spent only about $100,000 but has garnered more
newspaper endorsements that credit him with more specific stands on
issues than Mack.
   Still, published polls make Mack the heavy favorite to win the
GOP nomination, and his well-financed campaign and the divided
campaign on the Democratic side give him a good chance of
prevailing in November.
   ``I don't think it'll be an easy race, but I think it's
winnable,'' said State Democratic Chairman Charles Whitehead.
   In the Democratic primary, polls give Gunter the lead with about
40 percent of the vote. A candidate needs to top 50 percent to
avert a runoff Oct. 4.
   Gunter, who lost to Mrs. Hawkins in 1980, raised $1 million
within six weeks of entering the race, and opponents noted he took
at least $160,000 from the insurance industry he regulates as state
insurance commissioner. MacKay campaign manager Greg Farmer called
Gunter's department ``a saga of sleaze.''
   Polls indicated the race for second was too close to call
between MacKay, a three-term congressman, and Mica, a five-term
congressman.
   In the congressional races, 10th-term Rep. Bill Chappell,
touched by the Pentagon procurement scandal, faced a little-known
engineer in the Democratic primary, while three Republicans are
vying for the chance to challenge him. Chappell has denied
wrongdoing, although his name has been mentioned repeatedly during
the probe.
   Six Republicans are battling to succeed Mack. Former Rep. L.A.
``Skip'' Bafalis, who gave up the seat in an unsuccessful run for
governor in 1982, was expected to be in a runoff with former Lee
County Commissioner Porter Goss or retired Army Gen. James Dozier,
who was held hostage by terrorists in Italy.

   Capt. John Vandervalk
scanned the target and flung the plane in a stomach-wrenching
attack dive into the rocky valley below.
   The small U.S. Air Force OV-10 Bronco nose-dived, the force of
the acceleration forcing its two occupants back against their
armor-plated seats. Hills flashed past as Vandervalk streaked
toward the target, calmly checking the attack coordinates.
   White phosphorous rockets flashed from the plane's belly and
slammed into the practice target as the pilot jerked the plane up
over a rock cliff. Vandervalk glanced back to check his handiwork.
   ``We do everything as if it were Day One of a war, except nobody
shoots at us,'' Vandervalk explained after Thursday's flight. ``You
really have a sense of urgency and mission in Korea.''
   U.S. forces stationed in South Korea are on increased alert in
case communist North Korea makes any attempt to disrupt the Olympic
Games, which begin Sept. 17 in Seoul. The United States is helping
guarantee the security of the Olympics.
   Vandervalk and other pilots of the Air Force's 19th Tactical Air
Control Squadron serve as forward air controllers whose mission is
to spot and mark targets with smoke for other planes to attack.
Their small planes also fly attack missions against ground targets.
   ``We control violence,'' is the motto worn by members of the
squadron based at Osan Air Force Base south of Seoul.
   Hundreds of thousands of troops, including 42,000 U.S. troops,
face each other in a tense confrontation on the Demilitarized Zone
that divides the peninsula.
   U.S. forces have been based in South Korea since the United
States intervened to help the South after North Korea invaded in
1950 to begin the Korean War. An armistice was signed in 1953, but
the north and south technically are still at war.
   Col. Bob Hammond, commander of the 5th Tactical Air Control
Group, said the North Korean threat is a daily fact of life.
   ``I think the threat presented by the North Koreans is real.
They are not what could be classified as rational actors,'' he said.
   South Korean and U.S. commanders fear North Korea will attempt
to disrupt the Olympics because its demand to be a co-host of the
Games has been rejected. The North has a long history of launching
terrorist attacks against the South.
   ``The North Koreans would like to see an embarrassment to the
Republic of (South) Korea and the United States,'' Hammond said.
   U.S. troops won't be guarding Olympic venues, but the Games have
increased the sense of tension and spurred greater vigilance,
Hammond said.
   ``Everyone's adrenalin goes up. Everyone leans forward in their
foxholes,'' Hammond said.
   Airspace over Seoul and all Olympic sites has been declared
off-limits during the Games. South Korean military air controllers
quickly challenge any approaching plane.
   ``If you get real close to the capital area they threaten to
shoot you down,'' Vandervalk said after being challenged by an air
controller over the radio.
   Vandervalk, who has been stationed in South Korea for three
years, said training is intense because hostile forces are poised
just a few miles away. Pilots carry war plans on all missions.
   ``We're ready to go to work at a moment's notice,'' he said.
   Flying over Nightmare Range about 15 miles from the border,
Vandervalk pointed out a North Korean military air base visible
across the border.
   ``The North Korean MiGs can be on us in two minutes,'' he said.
   Vandervalk said he has not seen a North Korean jet during his
tour of duty in the South, but he and other pilots often hear the
north's military radio traffic while they are flying.
   The airwaves along the border constantly crackle with South
Korean and U.S. military air controllers giving instructions. The
area routinely is busy with warplanes on patrol or practicing.
   South Koreans have to live with a constant military presence and
frequent exercises that can be disruptive, but they accept the
inconveniences as unavoidable, Vandervalk said.
   ``It shows how lucky people in the West are,'' he said. ``When
was the last time an American had a tank roll through his garden?''

   When three Irish Republican Army members were
gunned down in Gibraltar on March 6 while allegedly plotting a car
bombing, the British government claimed a victory on the
battlefield of terrorism.
   Instead it got a political controversy that is still simmering
six months later. A long-awaited inquest into the killings opens
Tuesday in the British colony on the southeast tip of Spain.
   Mairead Farrell, Daniel MacCann and Sean Savage were unarmed
when they died. The car bomb, much to the British government's
embarrassment, never materialized, although the IRA admitted the
three were on a guerrilla mission and a car full of explosives was
found 40 miles from the scene two days later.
   Moreover, two British television networks investigating what had
happened that sunny Sunday in Gibraltar found witnesses whose
accounts strongly suggested the three were shot without being given
any chance to surrender.
   It all boiled down to a simple question that confronts every
democracy facing a terrorist threat: Did Britain bend the rule of
law?
   Critics like Amnesty International, the human rights watchdog,
which demanded an inquiry into the shootings in hopes of answering
that question, were rebuffed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
who said she was outraged that the question was even being asked.
   As far as the government was concerned, a disaster was averted.
It argued that there was no way of knowing on that day that no car
bomb was in Gibraltar; that it had to be assumed a bomb was set to
blow up a military parade and hordes of onlookers; that there was
no certainty the perpetrators were not armed and did not have
remote-control detonators to explode the bomb the moment they were
told to surrender.
   The government sought to dissuade Thames Television and the
British Broadcasting Corp. from broadcasting the documentaries,
arguing that ``trial by TV'' would prejudice the inquest.
   The broadcasts went ahead, confronting viewers with some
chilling accounts from witnesses.
   Stephen Bullock, a lawyer, told the BBC he ``saw a chap with a
white shirt reeling backward, with a man standing four feet away
from him, firing a gun constantly and following him down as he
fell.''
   He said: ``It wasn't a question of just putting one or two shots
into him just to stop him. It seemed to me this was a deliberate
shooting to kill, no question.''
   The BBC also quoted an unidentified witness who saw Sean Savage
on his back, with another man standing over him with his foot on
his chest.
   ``I heard no warning before the shots were fired,'' she was
quoted as saying. ``He continued to fire shots into the man as he
lay on the ground.''
   Carmen Proetta, watching from her apartment, said she believed
Mairead Farrell and Daniel McCann had their hands up in surrender
when they were shot dead by a man who ``went into a crouch position
and took deliberate aim at them.''
   The issues have been debated since 1982, when police in Northern
Ireland killed five unarmed suspects and an innocent youth in three
separate incidents. The arguments arose anew after three IRA men
were gunned down in a British army ambush in the west of the
province last Tuesday.
   Defending the government in the right-wing Daily Express after
the TV documentaries, Lord Chalfont denounced any ``equivalence
between indiscriminate killing in the course of political
terrorism, and the killing of terrorists by security forces engaged
in counterterrorist operations.''
   The liberal Guardian, on the other hand, maintained: ``A state
that turns to terror itself in desperate recourse'' in the end
endorses values of terrorists.
   Tuesday's inquest, which was postponed from June, is now the
focus of attention. Sixty-five witnesses have been called, and
Gibraltar is in a state of high alert, wracked by frequent bomb
scares.
   The seven operatives involved in the March 6 incident are
thought to belong to the army's Special Air Services, a top-secret
anti-terrorist team, and they will testify behind a screen to
prevent their being marked for reprisals.
   But the British government has reserved the right to keep them
away from the inquest.
   If the 11-member jury returns a verdict of unlawful killings,
Attorney General Eric Thistlethwaite of Gibraltar will prosecute
the perpetrators, according to high-level sources in the colony who
requested anonymity.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

   The Coast Guard fired warning shots at a
cocaine-laden freighter heading into St. John in the U.S. Virgin
Islands and arrested five crewmen who said they were Colombian
nationals, a spokesman said Sunday night.
   The freighter She-Me turned around and fled U.S. territorial
waters about 7:30 p.m. EDT Saturday after the Coast Guard cutter
Nunivak ordered it to stop, said Coast Guard Lt. John Felker in
Miami.
   Narrowly avoiding several collisions in an attempt to intercept
the freighter, the cutter received permission from Coast Guard
headquarters in Washington, D.C., to fire warning shots across the
freighter's bow, Felker said.
   ``Under the doctrine of hot pursuit, he was still in territorial
seas,'' Felker said. ``He was approximately nine or 10 miles off
St. John when the warning shots were fired, and the vessel was
seized.''
   Felker said 1,000 pounds of cocaine, hidden in a secret
compartment, were seized, and five crewmen were taken into custody
at San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   Felker said authorities were still trying to determine the
She-Me's country of origin and registry Sunday night.
   The seizure was aided by intelligence information from the
National Narcotics and Border Interdiction Service, headed by Vice
President George Bush, Felker said.

   When a town loses a river, the situation

   It has for Grayville, a town of about 2,300 that, until 1985,
sat on the banks of the Wabash River.
   The town didn't move; the river did, and now, after three years
of waiting for federal agencies or floods to return the river to

town.
   If Grayville's economic situation were better, residents might
be more tolerant of the river's shift. Several years ago, Grayville
was a thriving oil producer, but about the time the river changed
course, cheaper imports glutted the market.
   And because this year's drought dried up anticipated
agricultural income, the stagnant channel has become an unpleasant
reminder of hard times.
   Before the river changed course, hundreds of fishermen used to
crowd Grayville's restaurants, bars and gas stations every weekend.
The money they spent once would have buffered losses from oil and
agriculture.
   But now, like the Wabash, the anglers don't come around anymore.
   When spring floods receded in 1985, residents discovered the
river had left them. A new channel had cut off the horseshoe bend
upon which Grayville was founded.
   These days, fishermen are lucky to get a flat-bottomed boat in
the shallow waters of the old channel. And they'd better be
prepared to row, because a motor will strike bottom, residents say.
   Water that used to flow at 40 feet per second now doesn't move
at all. Silt that once was washed downstream is now filling in the
old channel, and tall weeds have taken over the sand bars that
boaters and swimmers once flocked to. Grayville's boat ramp is
usually empty.
   For three years, residents pleaded with federal and state
officials for money to bring the rambling river home. Federal
agencies came up with a package that would cost the town $900,000,
a quarter of the cost to build a dam to divert the Wabash back.
   ``There's no way the town could come up with $900,000,'' said
Mayor Jack Hagedorn, noting that the town's entire annual budget is
barely over $1 million.
   Talk at Bob's barbershop and other hangouts has focused on
residents taking care of the problem themselves. A recent editorial
in The Mercury Independent, Grayville's hometown newspaper,
criticized the lack of help from authorities and reported ``growing
sentiment among Grayville citizens to take matters into their own
hands ''
   The editorial refers to a rumored plan to dynamite a trench to
relocate the river, but adds, ``We have no idea this will actually
be carried out ''
   ``It's talk,'' said Alan Ritchey, who runs the Grayville sewage
plant. ``No one's got the courage to do it. Vandalism like that is
unheard of in Grayville.''
   He hates to see Grayville lose its source of pride. Some of the
town's most exciting history is tied to the river. A paddlewheeler
once sank there, and a train trestle collapsed into the river when
the town was young.
   Labor Day crowds will pack Grayville, but they're coming for the
town's annual holiday celebration, not to fish or swim in the
Wabash.
   Most of them will drive by the sign that welcomes visitors to
``Grayville _ On the Banks of the Wabash.''
   ``I would start looking for another monument to the town,''
Ritchey said.

   Evidence of the pugnacious politics of
Teamsters Local 560 can be seen in the graffiti spray-painted on
the concrete base of the Pulaski Skyway's hulking black girders.
   ``Remember Castellito,'' exhorts a scrawl, referring to Anthony
Castellito, a Local 560 official slain in 1961.
   Reputed Genovese crime family figure Anthony ``Tony Pro''
Provenzano and his brothers Salvatore and Nunzio ran the Union
City-based local until 1979, when Anthony Provenzano was convicted
of racketeering and ordering Castellito's killing.
   In 1984, a federal judge removed 560's executive board and
placed the local under a trustee to end a quarter-century of
organized crime domination.
   It was the first such action in U.S. history.
   This Labor Day finds Local 560 in its 26th month under the
trustee, Edwin Stier. But the trusteeship is scheduled to end Dec.
6, the date Stier set for 560's first contested election since
1965, the last year anyone ran against the Provenzanos.
   ``What's happening here is exactly what we wanted,'' said Stier.
``The candidates are going to each barn and campaigning in an open
election.''
   But in the barns, as the sprawling truck depots are known, the
trusteeship has not pleased many members.
   Some at first welcomed the efforts to exorcise corruption but
grew wary when U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani of New York recently
sued to place a trusteeship over the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters.
   ``We are keeping a sharp eye on events over the river,'' said a
federal prosecutor in New York who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``A smooth transition back to union control of the local could mean
a lot to our case against the international.''
   Three men are running for president of the 8,000-member local,
the Teamsters' largest: Michael Sciarra of the Teamsters for
Liberty, who served on the ousted board; Russ Viggiani, a Local 560
business agent and head of Teamsters for Solidarity; and Ray
Carney, a trucker who ran against Anthony Provenzano in 1965 and
leader of The Committee for the United Ticket.
   The government had sought to bar Sciarra from running, saying
the local would again be dominated by organized crime under his
leadership.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise is expected to rule
soon on the government motion.
   After U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman ordered the ouster
of the local's leadership, Sciarra served as interim president for
two years until June 1986, when appeals were exhausted.
   The goverment's case against Sciarra rests partly on secretly
recorded tapes of conversations.
   The tapes, made public during hearings, allegedly depict
Genovese captain Matthew ``Matty the Horse'' Ianiello telling a
former Local 560 official that Sciarra should ``take over'' the
union after the trusteeship.
   Sciarra has denied any link to organized crime or any intention
to take orders from anyone once elected. Though he declined to be
interviewed, he authorized union member and friend Al Laurie to
speak for him.
   Laurie said the tape transcripts are unclear about the subject
being discussed and who is speaking.
   ``Apparently from what we read of the transcripts there is the
indication that the things being said there were completely
contrary to some of the things the government is trying to prove,''
Laurie said.
   Whether or not the 55-year-old Sciarra is permitted to run,
Laurie said, Teamsters for Liberty will have a candidate.
   ``Mike has been president before and he's qualified to step
right into that job,'' Laurie said. ``Members may not realize that
this isn't a personality contest. This is about bread and butter
and about the pension and welfare fund, which is now about $230
million.''
   Stier, who has taken no official position on Sciarra's
participation, agrees Sciarra is probably the front-runner, but
that Carney has made inroads.
   Sciarra's two opponents, concerned about the possible backlash
that barring Sciarra could create, say they would like him to run.
   Viggiani, 48, said he believes the intimidation of the
Provenzano years still remains, though more subtle.
   ``There are still members concerned with reprisals who are not
openly supportive of an opposing ticket,'' he said.
   Stier said that intimidation has been ``only minor at this
point.'' Members ``understand if that starts to develop, it could
seriously hurt the chances for an election,'' he said.
   Carney, 58, admits that Sciarra has more experience because of
his 14 years in union office.
   ``But that's why we're where we are today,'' he said. ``I'm a
truck driver and I want to give this union back to the members.
They should have a voice and know where their money is going.''

<HEAD>50-State Survey Shows Dukakis, Bush Neck-and-Neck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis are locked in
an extremely tight race for the White House as the fall campaign
opens, with the vice president hoping to sustain his late summer
surge and his Democratic rival angling to regain the momentum,
according to an Associated Press survey of the 50 states.
   Advisers to both men as well as politicians around the country
say they expect a close race right up to Election Day on November 8.
   ``It's going to be down and dirty to the very end,'' said
Republican state Rep. Tom Ryder of Illinois _ a key battleground
where Republicans concede that Dukakis maintains a slight edge.
   In Delaware, ``as in the rest of the country, there's been a
substantial shift in the last three weeks from Dukakis to Bush,''
said the state's GOP Gov. Michael N. Castle. ``I think it started
at the (Republican National) Convention, as to be expected. But
since the convention, it's continued, even with the problems
surrounding the Dan Quayle candidacy.''
   The late-summer surge by Bush eroded Dukakis' earlier advantages
in key Electoral College battlegrounds from California to New
Jersey, with Illinois, Ohio and Michigan in between, say leaders in
both political parties. The result is a series of tight, big-states
races whose outcome will likely determine Ronald Reagan's successor
in the White House.
   Dukakis' selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his vice
presidential running mate transformed Bush's adopted home state and
its 29 electoral votes into an instant toss-up. But Bush has
countered elsewhere: the vice president seemingly has moved ahead
in Florida, with 21 electoral votes, as well as making up ground in
the industrial Midwest. One poll in Massachusetts even rated
Dukakis' home state a toss-up, though the AP survey still found the
state to be solid ground for Dukakis.
   In small states and large, politicians report a close contest
that is unlikely to be decided until the final few days. Campaign
debates and unexpected international events could have a dramatic
influence on the outcome.
   ``I'd say right now it's a flip of the coin,'' said former Iowa
Democratic chairman Ed Campbell, reflecting the sentiment of party
professionals around the country. ``It could go either way.''
   Senior officials of the two campaigns pronounce themselves
pleased with the shape of the race.
   Said Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager, ``Nationally,
we're competitive. States will go up and down. It's exactly where
we thought it would be. ... This is a very evenly matched contest.''
   ``We all felt like we'd be lucky if we were in the single
digits, meaning seven, eight, or nine points'' behind by Labor Day,
said Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager.
   Officials in both camps agree that the race is subject to sharp
swings, especially since neither candidate is an incumbent. That
heightens the importance of debates, the subject of negotiations
between the two campaigns with Dukakis seeking more and Bush less.
It also could heighten the effect of any mistakes by either of the
candidates or their running mates, Democratic Sen. Bentsen and
Republican Sen. Dan Quayle.
   Rich Bond, a senior aide in the Bush camp, says the race shapes
up this way: ``Basically you've got a tight race with the South
looking pretty much George Bush's way. The West with the exception
of the Coast (California, Oregon and Washington) is heading our
way, but can't be taken for granted.''
   Bond estimated that Bush heads into the race armed with a solid
150 to 200 electoral votes, principally from Southern and Rocky
Mountain States, and that Dukakis probably can count on a base of
150 electoral votes, largely from the Northeast.
   Democrats believe they can win electoral votes from each region
of the country, and note that Bentsen's addition to the ticket
makes Texas and its 29 electoral votes an extremely competitive
race. Dukakis adviser Tom Kiley puts each candidate's reliable base
at closer to 100 Electoral College votes.
   Even so, recent opinion polls indicate a dwindling advantage for
Dukakis in states he has long counted in his column, including
Maryland and West Virginia as well as Massachusetts.
   Charlie Baker, who is in charge of Dukakis' field organization,
said the Democratic goal is to keep the race competitive in 45 or
46 states so that if the Republicans ``have a bad week they can
lose'' in any of them. ``And I think we can keep it that close,''
he said.
   It takes 270 electoral votes to win the White House, and
Republicans have won four of the last five elections with solid
southern and western support. Jimmy Carter, a southerner, is the
only Democrat to break the Republican string of victories in the
last 20 years.
   With nine weeks until Election Day, these are some straws in the
wind:
   _California, the biggest state with 47 electoral votes, is
viewed by both sides as a toss-up with a slight, initial edge to
Dukakis. The state was a tie in one recent poll. Dukakis led in one
recent poll in Oregon, and Washington was a tie in another.
   _Republicans express confidence they can virtually sweep the
Rocky Mountain region. Democrats hope to steal a state or two,
perhaps Colorado, New Mexico or Montana.
   _The deep South looks strong for the Republicans, but Dukakis'
selection of Bentsen already has forced Bush to devote several days
to campaigning in Texas. Dukakis hopes to peel away a border state
or two, and maybe even challenge in North Carolina.
   _The Northeast is Dukakis' home region and his strongest, from
New York to Massachusetts to Maryland. Both sides give the Democrat
the early edge in Pennsylvania. New Jersey and Connecticut have
recent Republican histories, but are key targets for both
candidates.
   _The Midwest is wide open, although Quayle's spot on the
Republican ticket ended any talk of a Democratic surprise in
Indiana. Aside from Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, Dukakis is viewed
as the strong leader in Minnesota, and ahead less convincingly in
Wisconsin and Iowa. Bush led by 9 percentage points in a recent
Missouri poll, but Republicans rushed to say they doubted either
candidate could carry the state by that much. Republicans expect to
carry Nebraska and Kansas.
   Democrats say they have spent the past several weeks
methodically building a field organization, preparing television
commercials and mapping out their fall campaign, and that the race
won't be decided until the final days of the campaign.
   But where the Democrats sounded optimistic 10 weeks ago, now it
is the Republicans who have been heartened by their candidate's
late-summer offensive.
   Republicans concede Dukakis probably has the lead in Illinois
and a narrow advantage in Michigan and Ohio for the moment.

<HEAD>Lightning Danger Greater Than Thunder Indicates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both people and lightning-sensitive industries
may be in more danger than they realize, according to a researcher
who says the hazards of electrical storms have been underestimated.
   Lightning strikes the earth much more often than weather records
based on observers' reports indicate, says Stanley A. Changnon in
the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres.
   ``Those who have to worry about the risk of lightning damage,
for example nuclear power plants, have had to use data based on
(thunder records) to develop their risk analyses,'' Changnon said
in a telephone interview.
   ``It's very clear that thunder rather dramatically
underestimates the frequency of lightning near a given point.''
   Changnon discovered by using electromagnetic detectors to record
actual cloud-to-ground flashes that between 22 percent and 40
percent of lightning flashes occurred at times when no thunder was
heard.
   ``It is not good news,'' he concluded.
   Changnon, a researcher affiliated with the Illinois State Water
Survey, also teaches at the University of Rochester in Rochester,
N.Y. His report was done in conjunction with his son, David
Changnon of Colorado State University and Richard B. Pyle of the
State University of New York at Albany.
   Detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s,
Changnon explained, but they have always depended on the reports of
trained observers, primarily listening to the thunder generated by
lightning.
   In recent years, however, electromagnetic detectors have been
installed in many areas to record actual lightning strokes.
   The researchers compared reports by weather observers with the
lightning records from sensors used by the federal Bureau of Land
Management in Western states and by electrical utilities along the
Eastern seaboard.
   ``The degree of relationship is relatively weak,'' Changnon
reported. ``It gives one a lot of pause, in many respects, about
how the atmosphere works, how good our weather records are and how
safe we are.''
   In the West, Changnon reported, between 31 percent and 40
percent of all lightning strokes were missed by observers listening
for thunder.
   The situation was better in the East, with 22 percent to 26
percent of lightning strokes being missed, the report said.
   ``The differences are very marked between the East and West,''
Changnon said. This occurs, at least in part, because it is more
difficult to hear thunder in mountainous areas, he said.
   Another batch of the missed lightning strokes occurs before a
storm is reported in an area, he said.
   ``People sometimes say lightning comes out of the blue. It's not
necessarily out of the blue, just the front edge of a new or
fast-moving storm,'' he said.
   The study also confirmed that lightning varies considerably from
storm to storm.
   More than half of all electrical storms had only a few
cloud-to-ground lightning flashes, while a small number of storms
had hundreds of strokes.
   Indeed, in Washington D.C., records for three years showed that
nearly one-quarter of all the lightning strokes were accounted for
in just two big storms.
   The researchers also found a considerable number of
thunderstorms with no cloud-to-ground lightning. Cloud-to-cloud
lightning is blamed for the thunder in those cases. Changnon said
that is more common in the West, where storm clouds tend to be
higher above the ground than in the East.
   Lightning killed 86 Americans last year, the highest death toll
in this decade, according to records kept by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
   And the 365 lightning-related injuries reported across the
nation were nearly 50 percent more than the long-term average, the
agency said.
   As usual, Florida led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last
year. Tennessee ranked second with six, followed by five in New
Mexico and four each in Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi,
New York and North Carolina.
   Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey,
Oklahoma and South Carolina each recorded three fatalities. There
were two each in Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri, Utah and Virginia.
   Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and
the District of Columbia each recorded a single lightning death for
the year.

<HEAD>Council Recommended to Direct Federal Water Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next president should set up a ``water
council'' in his executive office to coordinate federal water
policy, which is now fragmented among several agencies, a Harvard
University study recommends.
   Such a council should include representatives of the states and
should be headed by a chairman free of ties to existing
departments, said a paper from the Harvard Water Policy Project,
part of the energy and environment program at the university's John
F. Kennedy School of Government.
   The new council ``would derive its principal influence from its
direct relationship with the president,'' the paper said.
   ``The absence of such an entity at present has led to the
intolerable situation of no agency within the executive branch
currently responsible for taking a comprehensive view of federal
water programs.''
   The report was written by Peter P. Rogers, professor of
environmental engineering and city planning, and Charles H.W.
Foster, adjunct research fellow and environment secretary in the
administration of Massachusetts Republican Gov. Frank Sargent in
1971-1975.
   The project was supported by grants from Resources for the
Future, a Washington think-tank which released the report last week.
   Several previous attempts to coordinate federal water policy
have failed. Most recently, a statutory inter-agency Water
Resources Council of Cabinet secretaries was formed in 1965 to
oversee planning, but was killed by agreement of the Reagan
administration and Congress in 1981.
   Reagan's Cabinet Council on Natural Resources, which tried to do
some of the same work, ``proved ineffectual and became essentially
non-functional after its principal enthusiast, Interior Secretary
James Watt, left office.''
   In an interview from Cambridge, Mass., Rogers said the Water
Resources Council ``moved in on agency programs, and the agencies
quite properly went to Congress.''
   The new council, he said, should ``stay out of agency turf,''
and try to ``pull the policy debates out of the agencies, where
people are debating themselves, and put them in a forum where they
debate other agencies.''
   By default, the Office of Management and Budget is now the chief
coordinating agency, and OMB _ a White House agency _ strongly
opposes creation of a new council on the grounds that ``everybody
wants a connection to the president,'' Rogers said.
   ``We have a colossal federal establishment, 60,000 or 70,000
employees, working on water subjects,'' he said. ``They ought to be
doing things that fit into some plan.
   ``It's not the most urgent issue facing the incoming president,
but if we don't do something the issues are going to just sit
there.''

   Thousands of protesters battled police
following the largest anti-government rally since the military
nominated right-wing President Augusto Pinochet as the only
candidate in a fall presidential referendum.
   More than 100,000 people packed blocks of a broad avenue in
central Santiago on Sunday chanting ``Pinochet's going to fall!''
   Police arrested 262 demonstrators and a police officer and eight
civilians were wounded, said Gen. Sergio Badiola, the governor of
Santiago. He said six of the injured, including the policeman, were
seriously hurt.
   Police fired tear gas, buckshot and water cannons when tens of
thousands of people began a march on the government palace after
the generally peaceful rally had ended.
   Organizers said 300,000 people attended the rally and
journalists estimated the crowd at more than 100,000.
   Gen. Pinochet, the 72-year-old army commander who has ruled
Chile with a military junta since a coup in September 1973, was
selected last Tuesday by himself and the commanders of the navy,
air force and national police as the sole candidate in the
presidential referendum scheduled for Oct. 5.
   Sunday's rally was the largest show of force by the opposition
since Pinochet, seeking popular support, lifted on Aug. 27 the
state of emergency that restricted public gatherings.
   There had been scattered street demonstrations after Pinochet's
nomination was announced Tuesday and three people were shot to
death and hundreds were arrested.
   Hector Moya, the main speaker at Sunday's rally, told the
cheering crowd: ``We can now clearly see that the Pinochet regime
already has been defeated.'' Moya is the head of the truckers'
union.
   When the rally ended a column of tens of thousands of people
marched to the city's center, blocking traffic. Police broke up the
procession and there were skirmishes throughout the area between
rock-throwing demonstrators and police firing birdshot and tear gas.
   Pinochet, in an ``open letter to the men and women of my
country'' printed Sunday in most local newspapers, promised full
democracy if he is returned to office in the referendum.
   ``If Chileans call me to govern, each one of them will govern,
too,'' the letter said.
   In an interview printed Sunday in the conservative newspaper El
Mercurio, Pinochet also promised to resign as army commander and
govern as a civilian.
   Chile's 7.2 million voters are to vote either for or against
Pinochet in the referendum.
   If approved, Pinochet will begin a new eight-year term in March.
If rejected, an open presidential election is to be held in
December 1989 with Pinochet remaining in power until an elected
president takes office.
   Pinochet led the 1973 military coup that ousted the elected
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende.
   Ricardo Lagos, a socialist opposition leader, called the rally
``the first step toward the final defeat of Pinochet.''
   Rally participants, including Chileans who have returned from
exile, sang and danced to political songs.
   Among the former exiles was Isabel Allende, 44, a daughter of
the late president, who died during the coup. She received a huge
ovation when her name was announced and joined in the dancing with
Lagos.
   Pinochet on Thursday decreed an end to political exile.

   Vice presidential candidates Lloyd Bentsen and
Dan Quayle are in sharp contrast when it comes to two of the more
valuable congressional fringe benefits _ speaking fees and free
trips.
   In the last six years, Quayle, a Republican senator from
Indiana, reported honoraria earnings of $250,050 from speechmaking
and another $4,830 from writing articles.
   Bentsen, a Democratic senator from Texas, accepted absolutely
nothing for outside speaking and writing, according to the required
financial disclosure statements covering 1982 through 1987.
   This doesn't mean that Bentsen, the chairman of the tax-writing
Finance Committee, isn't popular on the speechmaking circuit. It's
because he is one of a handful of senators who decline to take
honoraria.
   Quayle's receipts put him in the mainstream of the Senate, where
most members routinely pick up $1,000 to $2,000 a speech from trade
associations, corporations, non-profit groups, think tanks and
universities.
   The only restriction in the Senate on such outside income is
that if a member's speech and writing fees total more than 40
percent of the official salary _ $89,500 _ the excess must be given
to a bona fide charity.
   Quayle's 1982-1987 disclosure forms also show that he was far
ahead of Bentsen in getting free trips _ air fare, lodging and
sometimes meals _ often in connection with a paid speech.
   The Indianian reported 44 expense-paid excursions, including
destinations in Florida and Hawaii. In the same six years, Bentsen
took four free trips, three to his home state, the fourth to
Modesto, Calif.
   The two rivals showed parity in one fringe-benefit area, gifts.
   Bentsen listed two gifts, each a Steuben glass sculpture, with a
combined value of $2,750. Quayle's $2,436 in gifts were in the form
of golf equipment and clothing, including $825 worth in 1987 from
pro golfer Fuzzy Zoeller, a fellow Indianian. Quayle is an avid,
low-handicap golfer.
   Quayle's top honoraria year was 1983, when he got $54,150 for 50
speeches and $1,500 for an article for the Institute for
Socioeconometric Studies. There was no limit then on how much a
senator could keep.
   Quayle gave $1,250 of his 1983 speaking fees to charity, the
same amount as in 1982, when his honoraria totaled $40,650,
including $1,000 from his alma mater, DePauw University, for one of
his 38 paid speeches.
   A 30 percent-of-salary limit was in effect for 1984, when he
made 25 speeches, received $26,700 and gave $4,930 to charity. In
1985, he got $32,600 from 28 speeches, $40 from one article and
gave $10,277 to charity.
   The following year, with a 40 percent limit, he gave $19,991 to
charity after earning $49,400 from 37 speeches and $585 from three
articles. Last year, he got $46,900 from 35 speeches and $2,355
from nine articles and gave $14,302 to charity.
   During the six years, Quayle spoke most often to the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. His 21 appearances there
brought him $6,600.
   Quayle was popular with the Grocery Manufacturers of America,
making a speech to the trade association in 1982 for $1,000 and in
1984, 1986 and 1987 for $2,000 each of those years.
   He also received pay for speaking to defense contractors, drug
companies and health care associations. He is a member of the Armed
Services and Labor and Human Services committees, which handle
defense and health care issues.
   Quayle received speaking fees on 35 of the 44 free trips he made
during the six years.
   There was no speaking money on a five-day stay in Hawaii with
his wife in 1982, compliments of the Association of Steel
Distributors. He did get $1,500 for a speech on a trip to Palm
Beach, Fla., that year paid for by the Independent Bankers
Association.
   His peak travel year was 1983 with 15 trips, including three
nights in Orlando, Fla., _ and a $2,000 honoraria _ from the
American Medical Association. Other free destinations that year
included Miami with Magnavox Electronic Systems Inc., and West Palm
Beach, Fla., with Chase Manhattan Bank.
   Six trips in 1984 included three nights in West Palm Beach with
his wife. United Technologies picked up two nights' lodging. The
airfares and the third night were paid by the Indiana Constructors
Association.
   After a quiet one-trip year in 1985, he made three in 1986,
including three nights at an Arizona tennis resort for the ``13th
Annual Senators' Cup'' charity event. From there, the Outdoor
Advertising Association of America flew the Quayles to Palm
Springs, Calif., for three days.
   Last year, there were eight free trips, including charity sports
events in Park City, Utah, and Sun Valley, Idaho. He also received
a six-night stay in Monterey, Calif., from AT&T; four nights in Ft.
Myers, Fla., from the Electronic Industries Association; and a day
trip to White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., from the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, which paid $2,000 for a speech.
   Each of Bentsen's four trips was reported as a one-day
excursion. In 1985, the West Central Texas Oil and Gas Association
took him to Abilene, Texas. The following year, he went to Modesto
with the National Venture Capital Association; to Houston with the
Forum Club of Houston; and to Dallas with the National Association
of Home Builders.

   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is
recuperating today from minor head and chest injuries after
apparently being knocked out in a single-car accident near his
upstate training camp.
   Tyson's BMW apparently skidded on a wet road Sunday morning,
said a spokesman for the boxer, Dan Klores, who gave no other
details of the crash.
   A witness said the accident occurred while Tyson was driving his
car out of the yard at his adopted family's home in Catskill and it
skidded and slammed into a tree. He was found, apparently
unconscious.
   ``Mike was just leaning back in his car seat and I took his
pulse,'' said Yvonne Conrad, a niece of Camille Ewald, whom Tyson
has been close to since he began training in Catskill eight years
ago.
   ``He was normal, his breathing wasn't heavy or labored. I didn't
hear anything wrong with him. We just couldn't arouse him. We tried
to wake him up by asking `Mike, Mike,' and we just couldn't get
anything from him.''
   Tyson, who was recovering from a broken bone in his right hand
suffered in a street fight two weeks ago with heavyweight Mitch
Green, was taken to two upstate hospitals before being transferred
Sunday night to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center here.
   Tyson was hospitalized for observation and diagnostic tests,
said Dr. Carolyn Britton of Columbia Presbyterian. ``He suffered
minor trauma to the head and the chest wall,'' Britton said, adding
that Tyson's condition was stable. ``He's neurologicallly normal.''
   As Tyson arrived in New York City, his wife, actress Robin
Givens, tried to keep waiting photographers away from her husband.
   As cameramen pressed forward, Givens pushed them back, shouting,
``Give him a break.''
   Tyson, whose championship bout against British champ Frank Bruno
was recently postponed until Oct. 22 because of the hand injury,
was scheduled to accompany his wife to the Soviet Union on
Wednesday.
   In his last fight in the ring on June 27, Tyson knocked out
previously unbeaten Michael Spinks in 91 seconds, earning $22
million.

<TEXT>
   A 71-year-old retiree whose pet
crocodile bit off his arm was reunited with ``Charlene'' today and
said he'd keep her _ at his other arm's length.
   ``Its marvellous having her back,'' said Alf Casey. ``The
separation hasn't changed us.''
   Casey told the Melbourne Sun newspaper he thought his 23-year
friendship with Charlene, a 6{-foot saltwater croc, was doomed when
she bit the arm that fed her.
   Wildlife officers had wanted to shoot the reptile but Casey's
family intervened and Charlene was exiled to a crocodile farm in
Queensland.
   ``It was my fault. I asked her if she wanted some fish and I put
my hand in the bucket and didn't give her a fish,'' Casey said.
``All she could think about was the fish and with my hand being
there she bit it.''
   Despite losing his right arm and spending three weeks in the
hospital after the November 1986 attack, Casey said he always
wanted Charlene back.
   ``I must admit I do keep her at arms length now, but I get in
the pen with her and give her a bit of a scratch,'' he said.
   Casey used to take Charlene on family outings and to the local
pub until she got too heavy to handle, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Tutu: Voters Should Boycott Municipal Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
saying he was ``obeying God'' in defying the government, urged
blacks and whites to boycott next month's nationwide but segregated
municipal elections.
   Elsewhere on Sunday, black activist Winnie Mandela also violated
state of emergency rules by calling for increased international
economic sanctions against South Africa.
   Tutu, in a service at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town,
described the elections as ``ludicrous'' and ``unjust'' and said
the government was attempting to ``force participation.''
   ``I urge black people in this diocese not to vote in the October
elections and I hope that white Anglicans would join their black
fellow Anglicans in that action,'' said Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``I am aware of the penalties attached to this call. I am not
defying the government, I am obeying God,'' the black churchman
said.
   Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will hold
separate elections Oct. 26 to choose local officials. The black
majority has no vote in national affairs, although the nation's 26
million blacks make up about 75 percent of South Africa's
population.
   Under the 26-month-old state of emergency it is illegal to call
for an election boycott in South Africa. If convicted, violators
may be fined or imprisoned.
   In the 1984 municipal elections, anti-apartheid groups promoted
election boycotts and only about 10 percent of eligible black
voters went to the polls.
   Many black activists view black elected officials as
collaborators with the white-dominated government and its apartheid
policies of racial separation.
   Tutu said calling for an election boycott was a legitimate
``non-violent way of expressing our opposition to the evil and
injustice of apartheid.''
   ``You cannot get security through the barrel of a gun, nor
through the draconian and oppressive state of emergency,'' he said.
   Tutu spoke at a special service to install Canon Colin Jones as
dean of St. George's Cathedral. Jones, 37, becomes the first black
to serve in the post. He spent last year in Portland, Ore., and
most recently was the chaplin at the University of the Western
Cape, a mixed-race school.
   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok has threatened to clamp
down on anti-apartheid clergymen.
   ``We must clip their wings _ as we clipped those of the 19
revolutionary and activist organizations,'' Vlok said on Friday in
reference to the government's February decision banning most
leading anti-apartheid groups.
   Anti-government church leaders were among the few prominent
resistence figures spared in the crackdown, and they now are the
most visible domestic opponents of the government.
   Mrs. Mandela called for increased economic sanctions in a speech
at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   ``When we call for sanctions, when we call for disinvestment
from this country, it is because we are looking for those peaceful
measures as an alternative to the structural violence of the state
we see today,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mandela spoke to 400 people gathered to mark the
publication of a biography on her husband, jailed African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela. The book, entitled ``Higher Than
Hope,'' was written by South African academic Fatima Meer, who also
was present.
   The 70-year-old Mandela, South Africa's best known black leader,
is in a Cape Town clinic recuperating from tuberculosis.
   He has been imprisoned for 26 years and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.
The ANC is the major guerrilla group fighting white minority rule.

   Three years ago, Susan Shapiro refused to
stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in her high school class and
caused a nationwide stir. Today, she still gets hate mail, heckled
on the street and drawn into an occasional fistfight.
   Shapiro, now a 20-year-old hairdresser, says the memory of her
yearlong rebellion at Randolph High School remains strong.
Residents of this town, 13 miles south of Boston, ``will always
remember,'' she says.
   Hostile letters still trickle in. Every month, Shapiro says, an
anonymous letter arrives from Connecticut with a small flag sticker.
   The author usually writes ``watch out, we'll never forget, the
people never forget,'' said Shapiro, whose defiance was not
directly related to Gov. Michael Dukakis' 1977 veto of an amendment
that would have required Massachusetts teachers to lead their
classes in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   The controversy began during Shapiro's junior year in 1984. She
said one of her teachers explained that students need not stand for
the Pledge of Allegiance unless they wanted to.
   Shapiro said she and half of her class decided to not stand. She
said she considers herself patriotic but does ``not believe that
the American flag is a symbol of the American people.''
   But when Shapiro entered her senior year, a teacher took issue
with her decision to remain seated.
   ``She told me I was spitting on the American flag. ... I asked
her, `How would you like it if I spit on you?''' Shapiro recalled
during a recent interview at her home in Randolph where she lives
with her parents and her older brother.
   The incident found its way into a local newspaper. Within days,
Shapiro was interviewed by national publications and the television
networks.
   But the publicity boomeranged and Shapiro found herself the
target of hate letters, death threats and near assaults.
   In one incident, a grenade-like device exploded on the lawn of
the Shapiro family home, a modest ranch-style house on a tree-lined
street. The explosion burned a 6-inch patch of the front lawn but
caused no injuries.
   ``For a while I couldn't go to school,'' Shapiro said. ``I got a
lot of death threats.''
   Shapiro skipped her prom and graduation because of the furor.
But all year long, when she did attend school, she refused to stand
up during the daily Pledge of Allegiance.
   Shapiro and her mother, Harriet, keep a box of the letters from
the height of the controversy. Some were supportive, such as ones
from Vietnam veterans who encouraged her.
   Mrs. Shapiro also backed her daughter's defiance. ``We're
patriots. We don't hate this country. My husband and brother are
veterans,'' she said.
   But feelings against Shapiro ran high. Many letters carried
swastikas. Many were obscene. The outside of one letter warns that
the postal carrier ``might not want to deliver to these people.''
   ``You utter creep _ I hope someone blows you up,'' another said.
   Shapiro is cynical about the recent political flap between
Dukakis and presidential rival George Bush over Dukakis' 1977 veto.
   ``I just wonder where Dukakis was when this was happening to
me,'' she says.
   Today, Shapiro is content to remain in town working at a local
mall as a hairdresser. Though she still gets heckled, she said she
now knows how to defend herself. She said she's been in four
fistfights since 1985.
   Who wins?
   ``Me. I make my point,'' she said.

   The Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater
Chicago is trying to clean up its image with a new name, but it's
doubtful employees will want to be known as ``sludge-busters'' or
``scummy can cleaners.''
   ``People hear `sanitary' and they think `garbage,''' said James
Kirie, the district's finance commissioner. ``But we reclaim and
purify water and control floods _ that's our job.''
   Kirie, 77, decided to hold a contest to find a better moniker
and is personally offering a $1,000 first prize for the best name.
He said he has wanted to change the name for nearly two decades.
   Letters, poems, and dummy logos _ scrawled in crayon or
professionally typeset _ have spelled out clever and not-so-clever
suggestions.
   ``Metropolitan Sludge-Buster Treatment Department,'' ``Groovy
and Pure Channel District,'' ``Cook County Waters `R' Us,'' and
``Scummy Can Cleaners'' were among the suggestions.
   Some came up with names that suggested a theme park:
``Clearwater County,'' ``Neptune's Angels,'' and ``Everything
Water.''
   One woman thought ``Aqua Fix'' captured the essence of the
department, while one man thought ``Washers of Water (WOW)'' summed
it up best.
   Commissioners will narrow the list of possibilities this week,
Kirie said.

   Mayor Bud Clark says the ``Dress As You
Please Day'' is no longer a fashion hit and decided not to observe
the day of casual attire this year.
   Clark proclaimed a day for casual dress his first year as mayor
and drew nationwide attention. Similar observances followed in 1986
and 1987, but fewer and fewer downtown workers took part.
   Clark's top aide, Charles P. Duffy, says there's simply been no
demand for it this year.
   ``If people really wanted it, we'd do it, but we've only had one
phone call asking about it,'' Duffy said last week.
   Some events are just one-time happenings, Duffy said, ``and
Dress As You Please Day probably should have been one of them.''
   But former police chief Ron Still, Clark's challenger in this
fall's election, insists Clark dropped the event this year in an
effort to present a more conservative image to the electorate.
   Though the official observance of casual dress may be dead, some
employees keep it alive at City Hall, where air conditioning is
unknown.
   The city auditor allows shorts in the office when the mercury
tops 90 degrees, as it did last week.

<HEAD>Report: Kim Il Sung's Second Son Named Envoy To Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korean President Kim Il Sung's second son was
recently appointed ambassador to Hungary to avoid a possible
leadership threat to his older brother, a Japanese news agency
reported.
   Kyodo News Service on Sunday quoted unidentified Japanese
government officials as saying they had learned from Eastern
European sources that Kim Pyong Il, 34, was director-general of the
North Korean people's armed forces bureau before being named
ambassador.
   It quoted the sources as saying Kim Il Sung's oldest son and
designated successor, Kim Jong Il, 46, was having problems dealing
with the nation's stagnant economy the Olympic Games, which begin
this month in rival South Korea. North Korea has demanded to
co-host the games.
   Because of Kim Jong Il's leadership problems, the sources said,
people were beginning to favor Kim Pyong Il.
   Kim Jong Il is secretary of the ruling communist Workers' Party
of Korea.
   Kim Pyong Il was ``was taken out of the country tactfully
because the people's interest in him might cause problems for the
question of succession,'' Kyodo quoted the Japanese sources as
saying.
   Kyodo said Kim Pyong Il is the offspring of Kim Il Sung and his
present wife, Kim Song Ai, while Kim Jong Il is the son of the
North Korean leader's late wife, Kim Chong Sook.
   Kim Pyong Il had been in the military since graduating from Kim
Il Sung University, the state university named after his father,
Kyodo said.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials were not immediately
available for comment on the report.
   Kim Il Sung, 76, has ruled North Korea for nearly four decades.
He became premier in 1948, commanded North Korean forces in the
1950-53 Korean War and was named president in 1972.
   North Korea is considered one of the world's most closed
societies and Kim has established himself as the object of a
personality cult.

   The competition would have been stiffer in
the Governor's Cup Race for speedy crabs, were it not for the fact
that a few of the scuttlers arrived in a stiff state themselves.
   A one-clawed blue crab named Sutter's Gold, representing
California Gov. George Deukmejian, won the race during the 41st
annual National Hard Crab Derby & Fair on Saturday.
   Sutter's Gold scrambled to victory in the 16-foot inclined
wooden course in slightly more than one minute.
   Alaska's entrant, a king crab more than 4 feet from claw to
claw, dubbed ``King Louis the 49th,'' died in overnight mail from
Anchorage.
   ``The winners need to sit down and enjoy him, that's what he
would have wanted,'' a spokeswoman for Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper
said of King Louis' death. ``Just throw the butter in a pan and go

   A team of Dungeness crabs flown in from Washington state also
died before post time.

<HEAD>Eastern Posts Court Bond, Layoffs Effective Sept. 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines will lay off 4,000 workers
Saturday now that the financially troubled carrier has posted a
$4.7 million bond with a federal court in case unions battling the
cuts win their case.
   The bond was posted late Saturday, airline spokeswoman Virginia
Sanchez said Sunday.
   ``The layoffs will be effective September 10 at the end of the
employees' normal shift,'' Ms. Sanchez said. ``We really don't know
what the exact number of employees will be. Some may take early
retirement, there are different options.''
   No union spokesmen could be reached for comment late Sunday.
   But spokesmen earlier had said they eventually would win their
case.
   ``We strongly believe that the earlier ruling will be upheld,''
said Charles Bryan, president of the Miami local of the machinists'
union.
   The airline in July announced plans for the layoffs and service
cutbacks in 14 cities.
   The unions, however, contend that Texas Air Corp., Eastern's
parent company, is stripping the Miami-based carrier's assets in
favor of sister carrier Continental Airlines. Eastern has lost
about $1 billion during the past decade.
   The three main unions sued when the layoff plans, the largest in
Eastern's 60-year history, were announced. Those affected include
management, about 1,000 flight attendants, 1,000 machinists and 500
pilots.
   On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals dissolved an order by U.S.
District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington, D.C., who ruled
that Eastern could proceed with the service cuts but could not lay
off union members.
   The appeals court said the carrier would have to post the bond
to cover a month of paychecks should the unions win.
   After the machinists' union balked at pay and benefit cuts,
Eastern asked federal mediators to declare contract talks at an
impasse. If mediators, who have been involved off and on since
January, make the declaration and no agreement is reached after a
30-day cooling off period, the unions could strike and Eastern
could impose its terms on workers.
   Machinists union members are to vote Sept. 15 on a company
proposal for $161 million in annual wage concessions.
   The company and its flight attendants' union Thursday reached a
deal under which some workers would take leaves with workers
keeping seniority if called back.
   Service is being cut to Albuquerque, N.M.; Fort de France,
Martinique; Las Vegas, Nev.; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Oklahoma City;
Omaha, Neb.; Dallas; San Antonio, Texas; Pointe-a-Pitre,
Guadeloupe; Reno, Nev.; San Diego; St. Lucia, West Indies; Tucson,
Ariz.; and Tulsa, Okla.
   Eastern officials say they want to concentrate on their
traditionally strong Northeastern markets.

<HEAD>Walesa Says Agreement Only Chance To Make Solidarity Legal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa defended
ending Poland's most serious strike wave in seven years as the only
chance to legalize the independent union movement, and said he
would not tolerate wildcat strikes.
   Walesa, before 4,000 people in Gdansk on Sunday, responded to
Solidarity supporters who accused him of agreeing too easily to end
the strikes and should first have secured a firm agreement from
authorities on legalization.
   ``There is no other way. I must take this chance and I will,''
he said. ``I put out the strikes and I will put out the next ones.
I have not betrayed the people.''
   The occupation strikes, which began Aug. 16, ended Saturday at
Walesa's urging. Three days earlier, senior government officials
met with Walesa and promised ``roundtable'' talks on legalizing
Solidarity in exchange for an end to the labor unrest.
   The meeting was the first of its kind since communist
authorities banned Solidarity with a December 1981 military
crackdown that ended the 15-month heyday of the only independent
labor movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc.
   Walesa spoke to supporters in the courtyard of St. Brygida's
Roman Catholic church after an emotional pro-Solidarity Mass.
   ``To those who criticize me: Stop it,'' Walesa said.``Such
(decisions) are demanded by higher necessity. They (authorities)
spat on me and now I am extending my hand because there is a chance
to make Poland into Poland.''
   Walesa met with about a dozen top advisers on Sunday to discuss
the composition of a proposed workers' delegation to the government
talks, which in addition to focusing on Solidarity also would
address jointly confronting lifting Poland out of economic
stagnation.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban has said an end to strikes
would automatically mean convening the talks.
   The strikes ended Saturday when about 250 strikers carrying a
Solidarity banner walked out of the July Manifesto coal mine in
Upper Silesia and 2,400 bus and dock workers cut short strikes in
the northern port of Szczecin.
   At their peak, the strikes affected 20 enterprises with 100,000
employees. Poland's two biggest ports were virtually shut down and
production of coal from the Silesia region, a vital source of hard
currency, was sharply reduced.
   Miners at the July Manifesto mine started the wave of strikes,
disgruntled by paychecks they said fell short of expected raises.
They demanded better working conditions and compensation for 60
percent inflation.
   But like other workers around the country who quickly joined in
the strikes, their No. 1 demand was the restoration of Solidarity's
legal status.
   Communist authorities guaranteed the right to free trade unions
in an agreement signed Aug. 31, 1980, in Gdansk, opening the way to
legal registration of the Solidarity Trade Union Federation.
   On Sunday, tens of thousands of supporters of the banned Rural
Solidarity union gathered for a Mass at the Jasna Gora monastery in
the southern city of Czestochowa.
   Farmers orginally belonged to the main Solidarity federation,
but won their own union in May 1981. It also was outlawed after
martial law.

<HEAD>Study Says Sweatshops Not A Thing Of The Past</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report says sweatshops, thought
to be a thing of the past in American labor, continue to exist in
the United States.
   The General Accounting Office report released Sunday cited
restaurants and related businesses, apparel manufacturing and
meat-processing industries as the worst offenders.
   ``I think most Americans believe sweatshops vanished generations
ago, but they are here today, in all parts of the country,'' said
Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who had requested the study, in a
statement released with the report.
   Schumer also said he supported the report's conclusion that
penalties for labor law violations must be increased to deter
abuses.
   The report, based on interviews with 100 state and local
officials nationwide between January and May 1988, said restaurant
and apparel sweatshops were more likely to be populated by
Hispanics and Asians workers.
   The report also cited some of the same reasons for multiple
labor-law violations that were given in the 19th century: a large
immigrant work force and low profit margins in labor-intensive
industries.

<HEAD>Former Members of Congress Reap Big Retirement Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A taxpayers group says that more and more
former members of Congress will become millionaires in retirement.
   The National Taxpayers Union said Sunday former Rep. Ben Reifel
of South Dakota joins a former Maine senator this month as the
first members of Congress to receive $1 million in government
retirement pay.
   ``While most Americans can only dream of a million dollars in
retirement income, dozens of retired legislators will soon become
pension millionaires,'' said David Keating, executive vice
president of the taxpayers group, in a news release.
   Keating said Reifel will receive a September pension check for
$6,966, giving the former five-term Republican more than $1 million
since he retired from Congress in 1971.
   In May, former Republican Sen. Margaret Chase Smith became the
first senator to get a millionaire pension, said Keating.
   Congressional retirement pay is derived from a formula that
includes the average congressional salary over the last three
years, and the group predicted that a proposed increase in
congressional pay to $135,000 next year would greatly increase the
number of million-dollar pensions.

<TEXT>
   Flying across this nation, it is
virtually impossible to discern the mighty rivers that normally
ribbon the landscape. There are just vast seas of muddy brown water
_ and millions of stranded people.
   Floods have inundated three-quarters of Bangladesh and cut
transportation links from its major port to the capital and other
interior cities, officials say, though adding today that flood
waters on three major rivers were receding.
   In Dhaka, flood waters were at their highest levels in 54 years
and covered three-fourths of the capital.
   Dhaka newspapers today reported 60 more deaths, bringing the
toll to at least 942 since June, when rivers began overflowing
their banks in annual monsoon flooding in this impoverished nation
of 110 million people.
   The government count of 333 dead is widely considered low.
   Millions of the marooned are eating raw food and drinking muddy,
probably contaminated water, and 83,000 people nationwide have
contracted diarrheal diseases, said Health Minister Abdul Munim.
   He said 65 people have died of the diseases so far.
   ``It is a calamity,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told
reporters Sunday night. ``It is a havoc-creating, menacing flood.''
   Flying in an airplane across Bangladesh Sunday from the Indian
border to Dhaka, even the civilian pilot couldn't differentiate
between the rivers and the flood waters.
   ``I've never seen anything like it before,'' said Ghias Ahmad,
who has been flying over his country for 19 years.
   The waters swallowed up entire villages. Occasionally, tin roofs
glinted in the sunlight, the houses beneath them completely
submerged.
   On a few high spots of ground or short stretches of paved road
still above water, people milled idly, small boats beached beside
them.
   The Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers and their dozens of
tributaries flow from India and through Bangladesh to the Bay of
Bengal.
   The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon rains in
Bangladesh and India. Last year, the flooding in Bangladesh killed
about 1,500 people.
   This season, some refugees have found shelter in relief centers
or relatives' homes, said government officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity. But they estimated that at least 20 million
people were either stranded in their homes or marooned on small
outcroppings of high ground with few supplies.
   Wells and pumps are flooded, officials said, and flood water,
which is probably impure, is the only source of drinking water.
   The central government has appealed for foreign aid, including
boats, helicopters and 3 million tons of grain.
   Officials today reported water levels falling on the
Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna rivers. But relief officials cannot
reach many parts of the country because transportation has widely
broken down.
   ``Shortages of medicine, cooked food and drinking water is
causing untold miseries to millions of marooned people,'' a relief
ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
   The information minister said flood waters destroyed crops and
could prevent planting of the winter rice crop. He said this might
lead to a shortfall of 2 million tons of rice.
   The minister said Bangladesh needs 18 million tons of rice a
year to feed its people. He said 16.5 million tons are grown at
home and 1.5 million imported.
   In Dhaka, a city of 6 million people, gasoline has become scarce
for the few motor vehicles still navigating the streets. Many gas
stations are closed.
   Boats have replaced cars and bicycle-powered rickshaws in many
parts of the city. River boats capable of carrying 100 to 200
people sail between partly submerged houses in low-lying
neighborhoods flooded by the Buriganga, Turag and Sitalakhya rivers
that surround Dhaka on three sides.
   Many of the capital's streets are knee-deep and waist-deep in
murky black water that carries a strong stench of sewage, and
adults and children alike wade through it.
   Over the last week, the price of rice nearly doubled, from 15
cents a pound to 28 cents, as those who could afford it started
hoarding.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen in
foreign exchange dealings in Tokyo Monday, while share prices lost
ground in afternoon trading.
   After opening at 136.25 yen, the dollar was traded between
135.95 yen and 136.35 yen and ended Monday's session at 136.03 yen,
down 0.72 yen from Friday's closing.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 371.75-point
winner during last Saturday's half-day session, lost 146.67 points,
or 0.53 percent, to close at 27,341.58. The market's main barometer
gained 118.54 points shortly after the trading started, but
declined in afternoon trading.
   The dollar dipped partly because investors started selling the
currency after unfavorable U.S. unemployment figures were released
last Friday, according to a Bank of Tokyo foreign exchange dealer.
   ``But the dollar is still strong, and it's unlikely that the
currency will go down that much,'' he said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Share prices have been gradually recovering and regaining in
strength, said Toshiyuki Nishiguchi at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
``Share prices can't keep rising because the market doesn't have
enough energy, but trading is getting active, which is a good
sign,'' he said.
   ``As the trade volume increases, the market's energy to raise
share prices will follow,'' Nishiguchi said.

   Investigators concluded work at the site
of the Delta Air Lines jetliner crash that killed 13 of the 108
people aboard, refusing to comment about reports that two engines
may have failed.
   Some pilots speculated that two of the Boeing 727's three
engines may have failed because the wing flaps apparently were
retracted at the time of the crash, rather than extended for
takeoff, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday.
   ``When someone says `engine failure' there are a whole host of
things that might mean,'' Lee Dickinson of the National
Transportation Safety Board said Sunday. ``One of the things I will
not do is speculate on anything.''
   A recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine
failure. Two loud pops were then heard, which could have indicated
a ``compressor stall.'' But Dickinson said a compressor stall,
which occurs when an engine is starving for air, is not critical:
``Keep in mind, compressor stall is not serious, it's a hiccup.''
   Flight 1141 crashed and burned on takeoff Wednesday at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on a flight for Salt Lake
City.
   On Sunday, workers at the crash site sealed the cockpit in a
plastic blue tarpaulin. The wreckage was to be hauled to Delta
headquarters in Atlanta, where it would be dismantled and studied,
Dickinson said.
   Two flight attendants were taken to the wreckage and questioned,
but Dickinson said he had no information on what they told
investigators.
   The role of the wing flaps, which are extended during takeoff to
provide added lift, continued to be discussed
   Flight Engineer Stephen Judd has told investigators the flaps
were extended in the proper position upon takeoff. But evidence
from the wreckage indicates the flaps were completely or almost
completely retracted.
   ``We have further verification that the flaps were retracted,''
Dickinson said Sunday.
   Bill Melvin, a Delta pilot participating in the investigation on
behalf of the Air Line Pilots Association, said he believes Flight
1141's pilot could have been facing engine failure and decided to
retract the flaps in a last-ditch effort to save the plane.
   ``A 727 will still fly if it loses one engine, but all 727
pilots know if you lose two engines, the only way you can fly the
plane off is to get rid of the flaps,'' Melvin said, noting the
manuever is not an approved emergency procedure. ``With two engines
out, there's only one way that plane could fly _ with the flaps
up.''
   Dickinson said he didn't know what the procedure for the pilot
would have been if both engines failed: ``Each airline has
different operations. As you know, we will be documenting Delta's
procedure.''
   The 48-year-old pilot, Larry Davis, remained hospitalized today
and has been visited at Parkland Memorial Hospital by other
survivors offering thanks for the way he handled the crash,
enabling 95 people to survive.
   Davis is scheduled to under surgery Tuesday to have a metal
plate implanted under his left eye, said his 21-year-old daughter,
Christie. He suffered numerous facial fractures and a back injury.
   ``He realizes that it's God that did the miracle,'' Ms. Davis
said Sunday. ``God is the reason that he's alive. There's something
that God has planned for him.''

   North Korea said today that it has no intention of
disrupting the 24th Olympic Games, which begin in Seoul on Sept.
17, and said any incident or sabotage ``will have nothing to do
with us.''
   A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement said: ``We hereby make
it clear that we do not have the slightest intention to obstruct
the progress of the Games or threaten them by force of arms.
   ``If anything happens in South Korea during the Olympic Games,
it will have nothing to do with us and the United states and the
South Korean authorities themselves should be held responsible for
it,'' said the statement.
   It was carried by the north's official Korean Central News
Agency, which was monitored in Tokyo.
   The statement said North Korea announced last Saturday that it
would not participate in the Olympics because of South Korean and
U.S. efforts to manipulate the Games into permanently dividing the
two Koreas.
   The communist north, South Korea's bitter rival since the
1950-53 Korean War, had demanded to co-host the Games. The
International Olympic Committee has rejected the demand, saying the
Games are awarded to only one city.
   Pyongyang spurned an IOC offer that it host all or part of five
sports.
   South Korean authorities have said they fear North Korea might
stage terrorist attacks to interrupt the Games, which are seen as
an unparalleled chance for South Korea to gain worldwide stature
and exposure.
   Several times in recent years, shooting has occurred across the
tense Demilitarized Zone that divides the two countries.
   And in November, a Korean jetliner disappeared near Burma, with
all 115 people aboard believed to have died. A self-described North
Korean agent said she helped plant a bomb aboard the plane to
disrupt South Korea's presidential elections and the Olympics.
   ``As for `terrorism,' it is utterly alien to us and the United
States itself is the chieftain of state terrorism as already
exposed to the world,'' the nNorth's Foreign Ministry statement
said.
   ``We have no intention to `invade the South' and this is fully
borne out by the historical facts over the last 35 years'' since
the Korean War cease-fire, the statement said.
   It also accused South Korea, the United States and Japan of
creating tension on the troubled Korean peninsula through various
military exercises as an excuse to invade North Korea.
   ``They are abusing the name of Olympics for stepping up the
preparations for a war of aggression against our republic and
plainly shows their scheme to cause a shocking incident and start
another war in Korea in case the Games do not go as they wish,''
the statement said.
   The United States maintains about 42,000 troops in South Korea
and is planning to hold naval exercises off the Korean peninsula
during the Games to deter any attacks from outside.

   A week after disaster struck a West
German air show, Europe's top aviation event opened with a Soviet
cargo plane aborting takeoff when flames shot from one of its
engines 100 yards from spectators.
   The flames flared 20 feet from a port engine of the
blue-and-white Antonov-124 cargo carrier and a loud bang followed
as the world's heaviest aircraft began its takeoff Sunday before
10,000 spectators.
   A pilot cut the three other jet engines and halted the 400-ton
aircraft of the Soviet Aeroflot state airline. No one was injured.
   A Soviet official, speaking on condition of anonymity, promised
that the 400-ton plane would fly again at the Farnborough Air Show
``before the end of the week.'' He gave no cause for mishap.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said today: ``A loud bang
was heard all of a sudden during the run, literally several seconds
before the takeoff: a small flame appearing in one of the engines.
Though everything ended smoothly, the crew took a decision to put
off the flight.''
   Experts at air show, Europe's main aviation showcase, said the
engine must have stopped combustion as maximum fuel was pumped
through for a short takeoff to impress the crowds.
   Before the aborted takeoff, the Soviets thrilled first-day
spectators with displays by their MiG-29s.
   Organizers stressed that safety regulations at Farnborough, 35
miles southwest of London, were stringent.
   Their comments came after the Aug. 28 disaster at the U.S. Air
Force base at Ramstein, West Germany. Three Italian jets collided
during an aerobatics display at a Ramstein air show, and one of the
aircraft hurtled in flames into spectators, killing more than 50
and injuring more than 300.
   The display aircraft at Farnborough all had to fly away from the
crowd and most performed alone. All the aircraft were inspected by
the organizers before takeoff.
   The two MiGs, the first advanced Soviet combat aircraft to take
part in a Western display, took star billing.
   One of the twin-tailed fighters, painted in camouflage gray,
zoomed 3,000 feet into the sky from takeoff then fell backward,
nose still pointing up. Before gasping spectators, the pilot forced
the nose down, pulling the aircraft into level flight in a maneuver
known as ``tail-slide''.
   In a 3{-hour display in clear, balmy weather, West European and
American combat and civil aircraft also went through their paces,
mainly for the benefit of potential buyers flocking to Farnborough.
   Sir Frank Whittle, the 81-year-old inventor who first took out a
patent for his gas-turbine jet propulsion system in 1930, watched
the MiGs' display.
   ``I did that in 1929,'' he was quoted as saying by The Times of

<TEXT>
   Flying across this nation, it is
virtually impossible to discern the mighty rivers that normally
ribbon the landscape. There are just vast seas of muddy brown water
_ and millions of stranded people.
   Floods have inundated three-quarters of Bangladesh and cut
transportation links from its major port to the capital and other
interior cities, officials say, though adding today that flood
waters on three major rivers were receding.
   In Dhaka, flood waters were at their highest levels in 54 years
and covered three-fourths of the capital.
   Dhaka newspapers reported 60 more flood deaths today, bringing
the toll to at least 1,007 since June, when rivers began
overflowing their banks in annual monsoon flooding in this
impoverished nation of 110 million people.
   The government count of 333 dead is widely considered low.
   Millions of the marooned are eating raw food and drinking muddy,
probably contaminated water, and 83,000 people nationwide have
contracted diarrheal diseases, said Health Minister Abdul Munim.
   He said 65 people have died of the diseases so far.
   ``It is a calamity,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told
reporters Sunday night. ``It is a havoc-creating, menacing flood.''
   Flying in an airplane across Bangladesh Sunday from the Indian
border to Dhaka, even the civilian pilot couldn't differentiate
between the rivers and the flood waters.
   ``I've never seen anything like it before,'' said Ghias Ahmad,
who has been flying over his country for 19 years.
   The waters swallowed up entire villages. Occasionally, tin roofs
glinted in the sunlight, the houses beneath them completely
submerged.
   On a few high spots of ground or short stretches of paved road
still above water, people milled idly, small boats beached beside
them.
   The Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers and their dozens of
tributaries flow from India and through Bangladesh to the Bay of
Bengal.
   The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon rains in
Bangladesh and India. Last year, the flooding in Bangladesh killed
about 1,500 people.
   This season, some refugees have found shelter in relief centers
or relatives' homes, said government officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity. But they estimated that at least 20 million
people were either stranded in their homes or marooned on small
outcroppings of high ground with few supplies.
   Wells and pumps are flooded, officials said, and flood water,
which is probably impure, is the only source of drinking water.
   The central government has appealed for foreign aid, including
boats, helicopters and 3 million tons of grain.
   Officials today reported water levels falling on the
Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna rivers. But relief officials cannot
reach many parts of the country because transportation has widely
broken down.
   ``Shortages of medicine, cooked food and drinking water is
causing untold miseries to millions of marooned people,'' a relief
ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
   The information minister said flood waters destroyed crops and
could prevent planting of the winter rice crop. He said this might
lead to a shortfall of 2 million tons of rice.
   The minister said Bangladesh needs 18 million tons of rice a
year to feed its people. He said 16.5 million tons are grown at
home and 1.5 million imported.
   In Dhaka, a city of 6 million people, gasoline has become scarce
for the few motor vehicles still navigating the streets. Many gas
stations are closed.
   Boats have replaced cars and bicycle-powered rickshaws in many
parts of the city. River boats capable of carrying 100 to 200
people sail between partly submerged houses in low-lying
neighborhoods flooded by the Buriganga, Turag and Sitalakhya rivers
that surround Dhaka on three sides.
   Many of the capital's streets are knee-deep and waist-deep in
murky black water that carries a strong stench of sewage, and
adults and children alike wade through it.
   Over the last week, the price of rice nearly doubled, from 15
cents a pound to 28 cents, as those who could afford it started
hoarding.

   Just one day after Chicago's first bullfight, a
city official vowed to put an end to ``bull baiting,'' but
Hispanics said a ban would deprive them of an important facet of
their cultural heritage.
   During a Hispanic festival Saturday, four matadors confronted
three bulls in front of about 300 people in a temporary arena.
   It was a ``bloodless bullfight,'' in which matadors used capes
to attract the 1,000-pound bulls, but the animals had Velcro
patches glued to their backs to catch the matadors' Velcro-covered
swords and darts.
   ``This bloodless bullfight is just another form of teasing and
torment,'' Peter Poholik, executive director of Chicago's
Commission on Animal Care and Control, said Sunday.
   ``The cruelest thing they're doing is teasing the animal. ...
It's not right, but it's not physically harming the animal. We've
got enough of animal exploitation. We don't need this.''
   Poholik said he plans to ask Mayor Eugene Sawyer and other city
officials for an ordinance to ban ``bull baiting.''
   But an aide to state Rep. Benjamin Martinez, a festival
organizer, said bullfighting is part of Hispanic culture and should
not be banned.
   ``They've already taken away our language in schools,'' said the
aide, Rodolfo Mancilla. ``Now they want to take away our folklore,
tradition, heritage, culture. You just can't keep doing that and
have people stand for it.''
   While real bullfighting is not permitted in the United States,
three states _ Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas _ have allowed the
bloodless variety, Poholik said.
   Chicago has an ordinance to prevent bullfights. But Cook County
Circuit Judge Albert Green on Friday ordered the city to grant a
permit to Jaass Productions to stage the exhibition because the
bulls are not killed.
   After watching Saturday's bullfight with an investigator from
his staff and state officials, Poholik said the animals were not
treated harshly.
   ``The promoters kept their word. There was no blood drawn,''
Poholik said. ``The animals were in excellent condition _ well fed.
There was a good corral area. You could tell they were well cared
for.''
   Many of the spectators were also concerned about the animals.
   ``Most of the people were rooting for the bulls,'' Poholik said.
``They cheered when the matadors got knocked down.''
   The bulls' ultimate destination is the butcher shop, said
breeder Manuel Correla. The animals ``learn quickly'' and can only
be used for one bullfight, he said. ``We use them for hamburger.''

<HEAD>Woman In Suspended Animation For Nearly Hour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 76-year-old woman was placed in suspended
animation nearly an hour as surgeons removed an egg-sized aneurysm
from the base of her brain, hospital officials said.
   Cecilia Duffy of Pittsburgh remained comatose Sunday and listed
in critical condition, four days after the unusual operation, said
Judy Secreto, an Allegheny General Hospital spokeswoman.
   ``It's not uncommon for it to last a couple of days,'' Ms.
Secreto said.
   Surgeons removed the aneurysm from Ms. Duffy's brain after
dropping her body temperature by 40 degrees and draining the blood
from her body. Her heart was stopped during Wednesday's operation.
   The coma was induced by barbiturates to protect the brain while
blood flow was suspended, said Ms. Secreto.
   Dr. Julian E. Bailes, a neurosurgeon, said Ms. Duffy fit the
legal criteria for brain death during the 51{ minutes of suspended
animation.
   The aneurysm, a bubble in the blood vessel caused by weakness in
the vessel wall, was suctioned out while Ms. Duffy was on the
bypass machine.
   Any more pressure by the aneurysm would have compressed on the
vital centers of the brain stem, and her heart would have stopped
or she would have gone into a coma and died, Bailes said.
   ``I'm still worried about her but, objectively speaking, there
is a good chance she may pull through this thing,'' he said.
   Post-surgical scans showed increased brain activity, and Ms.
Duffy was moving her legs when touched, according to Bailes. But,
he said, ``There's such a fine line between a perfect outcome and
her never waking up. That's the hard thing.''
   Ms. Duffy had become almost completely disabled during the past
year because of the aneurysm.
   Bailes initially had recommended that Ms. Duffy go to the Barrow
Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Ariz., where he learned the
procedure before coming to Pittsburgh in July. She did not want to
leave Pittsburgh, however.
   Dr. Robert F. Spetzler, director of the Barrow institute, and
six colleagues published an article on the technique in June in The
Journal of Neurosurgery. Of the seven cases cited, all but one
patient survived and four had ``excellent'' results. The two other
survivors reported some weakness but otherwise did well.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Fall In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both the dollar and stock prices lost ground in
cautious trading in Tokyo today.
   The dollar opened at 136.25 yen, down 0.50 yen from Friday's
close, and then declined further to end the day at 136.03 yen, down
0.72 yen. The U.S. currency ranged between 135.95 yen and 136.35
yen, with spot trading estimated at $4.4 billion.
   It was the first day-to-day decline in the dollar in Tokyo since
last Monday.
   Foreign exchange traders were in a cautious mood because the New
York market was closed for the Labor Day holiday, said a dealer
with Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo.
   ``In addition, today is Monday, when trading usually gets
cautious, which makes it even harder for investors to figure out
which direction the market is going to go,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``That's why the dollar-yen exchange rate changed frequently
within a narrow range,'' he added.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 371.75 points during Saturday's
half-day session, lost 146.67 points, or 0.53 percent, closing at
27,341.58.
   Although the Nikkei index opened the day strongly, it then
reversed directions as trading slowed down.
   ``The dollar-yen rate, which is getting stable, and the
increased U.S. jobless rate made investors less worried about
inflation, but they couldn't be completely optimistic yet,'' said
Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities.
   ``After the active trading in the early morning, some investors
started selling stocks for profit-taking, which was another reason
that prices went down,'' he said.
   But he said the market was regaining its strength as unfavorable
external factors disappeared. ``The market just needs a little more
energy. But share prices usually don't rise much the day after a
big rebound anyway,'' he added.
   Trading on the market's first section was thin, with an
estimated 500 million shares changing hands, compared with the 524
million shares traded during the half day Saturday.
   Among issues losing ground were steels and electricals.

<TEXT>
   A telephone caller posing as a hospital
employee persuaded a woman to cut off her hair after tricking her
with a false tale of possible exposure to toxic chemicals.
   Lisa Hansen said Sunday she was ``spooked'' by the incident and
had temporarily moved out of her home here.
   ``Let's hope the police do something about it,'' she said.
   Ms. Hansen, 21, reported the incident to authorities Saturday.
She bought a $60 wig to cover her shorn locks.
   ``He kept saying, `Be sure to cut close to the scalp, so we get
a good test,''' Ms. Hansen said.
   The man, who claimed to work for Mandan Hospital, told Ms.
Hansen she might have been exposed to toxic polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs, through her former husband, a truck driver who
sometimes hauls chemicals.
   Bradley Hansen had already been admitted to the hospital for
tests, some of which confirmed the contamination, the caller told
Ms. Hansen. When Ms. Hansen asked to speak to Hansen she was told
he was still groggy from sedation.
   Ms. Hansen then told the caller she wanted to go to the
hospital, but the caller told her she was ``under quarantine'' and
would have to cut samples of her hair at home, which the state
health department would collect later.
   After she finished cutting her hair, the caller told Ms. Hansen
it was a hoax, she said.
   Mary Ellen Rebenitsch, a hospital spokeswoman, said Sunday the
hospital does not have an employee by the name the caller used.

   A fire in the hold of a 500-foot freighter
caused 24 firefighters to seek treatment for heat exhaustion and
sent one other to a hospital because of chest pains, officials said.
   Sunday afternoon's fire, which took 1{ hours to extinguish, was
blamed on an electrical malfunction in the docked container ship
Waardrecht, said city Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells.
   Twenty-four of 80 firefighters who battled the blaze were
treated at the scene for heat exhaustion as record-high
temperatures above 100 degrees compounded the heat of the flames,
Wells said.
   One firefighter was taken to a hospital in stable condition for
evaluation of chest pains, Wells said.
   A damage estimate for the ship wasn't immediately available,
said Wells.
   The Waardrecht arrived Saturday from San Francisco after a

<HEAD>USS Vincennes On Its Way Home, British Warship Damaged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The missile cruiser that mistakenly shot
down an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf is on its way home in
the first U.S. force reduction in the region since the Iran-Iraq
cease-fire took hold.
   France has also begun its planned naval cutbacks in the gulf
region. British officials said a Royal Navy destroyer was badly
damaged when it collided with a British cargo ship it was to escort.
   The USS Vincennes was officially detached from the Navy's Joint
Task Force Middle East on Sunday for a 13,000-mile voyage to San
Diego, where it had been based until April, said U.S. sources in
the gulf, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Vincennes shot down an Iranian A300 Airbus on July 3,
killing all 290 people aboard. It mistook the jet for an Iranian
F-14 fighter. An official U.S. report blamed the tragedy on crew
stress in a first-time combat situation.
   The 9,600-ton warship, the first of the Navy's high-tech
``Aegis'' cruisers deployed in the gulf, was pulled out of the
waterway after the disaster and operated in the Arabian Sea.
Sources said the Vincennes would not be replaced, in effect
reducing the U.S. fleet from 27 to 26 ships.
   U.S. Navy sources said the Pentagon has given no timetable for
cutbacks and other U.S. warships are being replaced as planned.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Bill O'Connell said
Sunday afternoon that the Vincennes ``was still part of the Joint
Task Force Middle East.'' He declined to say if the ship was
preparing to leave or would be replaced because ``we don't discuss
operations of ships.''
   Hours before it was to sail, the Vincennes was one of several
warships that responded to a distress call from the British
destroyer Southampton after its collision with the freighter Tor
Bay in the Gulf of Oman.
   The 4,100-ton destroyer, with a gaping 9-foot hole in its port
bow and its bridge crumpled by the impact, reached the United Arab
Emirates port of Fujairah. Three crewmen were hospitalized with
broken bones, naval sources said.
   In Paris, the French Defense Ministry announced it was
withdrawing the aircraft carrier Clemenceau and three other ships
from its Indian Ocean fleet, which covers the gulf. The other
vessels were the destroyer Du Chayla, the oiler Var and the Cantho,
one of three French minehunters in the area.
   The French move reduces its squadron from 11 warships to seven.
   That is the largest single cutback since the Aug. 20 cease-fire
by any of the six Western governments that have kept naval forces
in the gulf region during the past year to protect merchant
shipping from attack.
   The Defense Ministry, in a statement from Paris, said the move
was made ``taking into account the evolution of the situation in
the region and the new perspectives for peace.''
   Western forces in the region have said they intend to reduce
their numbers, which total more than 60 warships of various types,
if the Iran-Iraq cease-fire continues to hold.
   Italy, the first to cut back, withdrew a frigate the day after
the truce began. It still has five ships _ two frigates, two
mine-hunters and a supply vessel _ in the gulf region.
   Other warships include eight British, one Belgian, one Dutch and
as many as nine Soviet vessels.

   A plainclothes officer was shot dead in the
year's first gang-related police slaying, and authorities said
joint local and federal efforts were not stopping the violence that
may make 1988 the bloodiest ever.
   Officer Daniel Pratt was shot in the face during a drive-by
shooting Saturday night in south-central Los Angeles. He and his
partner were pursuing a car believed to be involved in another such
shooting minutes earlier that wounded three, police said.
   Pratt, 30, died later at a hospital. The six-year veteran leaves
behind a pregnant wife and three children. A 20-year-old gang
member believed to be the triggerman was arrested Sunday.
   With flags outside police headquarters standing at half staff
Sunday, Police Chief Daryl Gates lamented the department's loss.
   ``Here was a fine officer and family man, with a child he'll
never see, dead because of some no-good, miserable sons of bitches
out there that society allows to roam the streets,'' Gates said.
   Pratt is the first police officer killed in a drive-by shooting,
which has often been used by gangs. A police officer in 1987 was
killed in a gang gun battle.
   Eleven people were slain in gang shootings in the last weekend
of August, and more than 200 people have died this year. The death
toll should climb to an all-time high of more than 400 by year's
end, making 1988 the bloodiest year ever for gang crimes, officials
said. There were a record 387 gang-related murders in Los Angeles
county in 1987.
   The violence has left law enforcement officials struggling to
end the rampage.
   Police launched a full-scale assault in March. Twice since then,
the LAPD has marched 1,000 officers into the most gang-infested
areas on weekends.
   Overall crime rate declined, but the gang murder rate continues
to climb.
   ``We're in a holding action. We're keeping the flames from
spreading but we're not putting them out,'' said Robert
Philibosian, former county district attorney and head of the state
task force on gangs and drugs.
   While the carnage mounts, Los Angeles gangs continue to export
their drug trade to Seattle, Kansas City, Arizona and Philadelphia
as they expand their rock cocaine-trafficking network.
   ``It's going to take years. The FBI has worked at stopping the
drug problem for 30 years and still hasn't stopped it,'' said
Lawrence Lawler, the new FBI chief for Los Angeles. ``It's a form
of life to some people. It may be an entire generation before this
goes away.''
   The LAPD will continue the sweeps but begin expanding tactics by
targeting hardcore leaders of the most powerful neighborhood gangs,
said Deputy Chief William Rathburn.
   Prosecutors, police and the school district are trying to help
with such programs as GREAT, the Gang Reporting, Evaluation and
Tracking; RSVP, the Reduction of Street Violence Program, and
OASIS, for Operation Stay in School.
   And the Community Youth Gang Services, an organization of former
gang members and others, gave jobs to 111 gang members this summer.
   Southside clergy members tried their part this summer by holding
two gang summits. The first in July attracted about a dozen
``gang-bangers.'' A two-day summit last week drew 50, and when it
ended, the members of the rival Crips and Bloods vowed to lay down
their guns, end their gang affiliations and form a network to
convince other ``homeboys'' to do the same.
   ``We have intelligence and want a quality education. I know that
we're running out of time ... America, listen today,'' said gang
member Raymond Cook Bay, who attended the summit.
   Officials criticized the summits for giving a false impression
of optimism because the small number of gang members participating
don't represent the 70,000 members from the 600 street gangs. But
organizers say at least they're doing something.
   Officials also cautioned it will be a long time before the
programs and law enforcment efforts take effect.
   ``Be patient a little longer,'' said Sgt. Wes McBride of the
county sheriff's department. ``It will change. We'll get a handle
on it, but it won't be an overnight thing. We will win. We will
finally beat them down.''

<TEXT>
   China's leading dissident said today that
anti-Marxist feeling is widespread in Communist China, but that
obstacles to independent labor or political groups remain
formidable in the authoritarian state.
   ``Many people don't agree with Marxism, even workers and
students,'' Fang Lizhi, a 52-year-old astrophysicist, said during
an interview with four Western journalists. ``Even people of my
generation ... don't believe in Marxism.''
   Fang supports a multiparty democracy over one-party Communist
rule and believes the first step toward political reform should be
seeking freedom of speech and of the press, which is now strictly
controlled by the state.
   Taiwan, the seat of the Nationalist Party that still claims to
be the legitimate ruler of all China, could provide an example of
political reform with the recent end of a ban on opposition
parties, Fang said.
   Although Taiwan's multiparty system is just getting started,
``at least it's better than the (Chinese) mainland,'' Fang said.
   But Fang acknowledged conditions are not yet ripe for formation
of new political groups in China.
   ``They should wait (until) the private economy becomes dominant,
or at least becomes a larger factor,'' said Fang, who stressed that
the emergence of an independent middle class may be key to creating
new political forces.
   In the past decade, senior leader Deng Xiaoping has introduced a
number of market-oriented economic reforms to stimulate production
and modernize China after the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution nearly
destroyed the economy.
   Private enterprise is flourishing in some regions, although
China's leaders still believe in central economic planning.
   Fang was purged from the party last year when authorities
accused him of inciting pro-democracy student demonstrations in
several cities.
   He was forced to resign from his post as vice president of the
Science and Technology University in Hefei, Anhui province, and was
transferred to the Beijing Observatory, where he continues his
research and writing.
   Workers share many of the students demands for political freedom
but face a daunting task organizing independent groups such as the
outlawed Solidarity labor movement in Poland, Fang said.
   ``The organization of dissident organizations, something like an
independent union, is very difficult'' because of strong government
opposition, he said.
   Many Chinese students regard Fang as a hero for his outspoken
criticism of the Communist government. When he spoke informally to
a group at Beijing University earlier this year, a crowd of
students thrust books, envelopes and paper money for him to sign.
   Chinese authorities have allowed Fang to travel overseas despite
his criticism. Fang acknowledged that Beijing may be trying to
improve its image by allowing him to speak out but added: ``I also
use the opportunity to say more.''
   The astrophysicist said he does not want to get into politics or
form a political party. Instead, he views his role as ``introducing
some concepts'' to China, such as democracy.
   Fang believes democracy can work in China despite the nation's
dynastic history of authoritarian rule and unwieldy size of more
than 1 billion people. He suggests democracy would help reduce many
of the country's ills, including rampant corruption.
   During the interview, he harshly rejected Marxism as the worst
thing in China.
   Fang says it is difficult to know the precise policy position of
any leader because China has ``no glasnost,'' a reference to the
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   Fang and and his wife, Li Shuxian, a professor of physics at
Beijing University, were briefly in the British colony on the
southeastern coast of China at the invitation of a local college.
They arrived after visiting Australia and Singapore.

<HEAD>U.S. Defense Secretary In First Trip To China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci today began
his first trip to China, a five-day visit expected to include
discussions on U.S. concerns about Chinese arms sales in the Middle
East
   Carlucci is to hold talks on global, regional and bilateral
issues with his host, National Defense Minister Qin Qiwei. He is
also scheduled to meet China's top leader, Deng Xiaoping, and
Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   He spent two days in Guam before flying to Beijing, where he was
met at the airport by Gen. Sung Wenzhong, head of the bureau of
foreign affairs in the People's Liberation Army.
   Carlucci is expected to restate U.S. concerns about China's arms
sales to the Middle East, which Washington says could destabilize
military balances in that volatile region.
   China has reportedly sold Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran
and recently agreed to supply Saudi Arabia with medium-range
surface-to-surface missiles. U.S. officials say China is also
trying to sell to Syria a shorter-range missile now under
development.
   China, which denies selling Silkworms to Iran, is building up
its arms industry to help finance the modernization of its own
armed forces.
   When Secretary of State George P. Shultz brought up the issue of
Middle East sales during a visit in July, the Chinese said the
weapons were of a defensive nature and the sales carried out in a
responsible manner.
   Chinese officials are, in turn, likely to urge Washington to
ease restrictions on sales of high technology items to China.
   The Chinese say U.S. businessmen are losing business to Japanese
and European competitors because the Pentagon is reluctant to allow
transfer of some types of technology.
   In particular, China is expected to urge the Reagan
administration to give the go-ahead for U.S. companies to use
Chinese Long March rockets to launch satellites.
   Reagan is to make a decision on the Chinese launches later this
month. The State Department has recommended that Reagan grant
export licenses for the satellites, but the Commerce Department has
objected, saying that would undercut U.S. companies trying to
develop satellite launching services.
   Carlucci's visit is the third by a Pentagon chief during the
Reagan administration, following visits by former Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger in 1983 and 1986.
   Visits and personnel exchanges between the militaries of the two
countries have become common, and U.S. military sales to China have
grown at a steady if modest pace.
   The United States has supplied China with transport helicopters
and avionics equipment for Chinese fighter planes, and Boeing is
now holding negotiations on possible sales of about a dozen CH-47
helicopters for use in a Chinese rapid deployment force.
   Carlucci is also to travel to the ancient capital of Xian and
stop in Shanghai, where he will tour a Chinese naval facility.

   A 52nd person died from severe
injuries suffered from the fiery air show disaster at the U.S. Air
Force Base in Ramstein, a West German official said today.
   Juergen Dietzen, spokesman for the Rhineland-Palatinate state
government, said the West German died Sunday, but had no other
details.
   Dietzen said the 52 who had died in the Aug. 28 disaster
included 45 West Germans, the three Italian pilots killed in the
mid-air collision that began the disaster, two Americans and a
French and a Dutch citizen.
   The American victims were a U.S. Army private and her 9-year-old
son.
   Dietzen said 164 people remained hospitalized from injuries
sustained when an Italian air force stunt team jet collided with
two other jets and crashed in flames into the a crowd of spectators.
   Of that number, ``10 of them are in life-threatening or very
serious condition,'' Dietzen said.
   Meanwhile, seven Americans hospitalized at the U.S. Army
hospital in nearby Landstuhl are in good condition, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   ``All seven of them are in good condition. They're able to sit
up and talk,'' Landstuhl hospital spokeswoman Marie Shaw said.
   Ms. Shaw could not say when the patients, still being treated
for burn injuries, would be released. She identified the patients
as:
   _Sonya Fuller, 25, of Cheyenne, Wyo., wife of Airman Jeff
Fuller, who is assigned to the 66th Security Police Squadron at
Sembach Air Force Base.
   _William Granflor, 9, son of Sgt. Guillermo Granflor of San
Gabriel, Calif., who is assigned to the 86th Component Repair
Squadron at the Ramstein Air Base.
   _Sgt. Karl Heilig, 31, of San Antonio, Texas. Heilig is assigned
to the 86th Equipment Maintenance Squadron at Ramstein.
   _Lisa A. Newton, 18, daughter of Sgt. Leon Newton, who is
assigned to the U.S. Army's 32nd Support Command at Worms. No U.S.
hometown was given for Miss Newton.
   _Roberta Nicks, 26, of Pittsburgh, Pa., wife of Army Sgt. Lonzo
Nicks, who is assigned to the 11th Signal Battalion, Kleber
Kaserne, Kaiserslautern.
   _David Olson, 21, son of Maj. Steven Olson of Marinette, Wis.,
who is assigned to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing at Ramstein.

   Kurdish guerrillas claimed today they
have killed or wounded 7,000 Iraqi soldiers in fierce fighting in
northeastern Iraq. They said nearly 2,000 civilians also died.
   The guerrillas acknowledged several of their bases have been
overrun. They said the bases fell after repeated poison gas attacks.
   There was no independent confirmation of the Kurdish claims.
Turkish officials said that about 90,000 Kurds, including some
wounded guerrillas, have fled across the frontier in recent days.
   ``Most of the Kurdish civilian casualties are from constant
Iraqi poison gas attacks on their villages and settlements,'' a
spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Party told The Associated
Press by telephone.
   ``Iraqi troops has overrun our bases in Zakho and Dahok
provinces, but our guerrillas are still engaged in fierce fighting
inside Iraq to save our civilian population from severe Iraqi
reprisals,'' he said.
   The spokesman, based in a West European capital, has given
information to the AP on several other occasions. He declined to
give his name for security reasons. Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have
been waging their separatist struggle on and off for 50 years.
   Kurdish officials said many of the refugees were injured in
mustard gas attacks, but there was no official Turkish confirmation.
   Kurdish guerrillas are battling an estimated 60,000 Iraqi troops
who are supported by tanks, artillery, fighter-bombers and
helicopter gunships.
   The Iraqis launched a major offense Aug. 26 against the rebels.
   The guerrillas claimed the Iraqis have carried out scores of
poison gas attacks in recent weeks against Kurdish villages and
guerrilla bases. Iraq has denied using chemical weapons, outlawed
under a 1925 Geneva treaty.
   The spokesman stressed that Kurdish ``resistance is continuing''
in the Amadiyah and Sherwan regions.
   He said the guerrillas were trying to avoid set-piece battles
with the heavily armed Iraqis and were ambushing military columns
in coordinated hit-and-run attacks.
   He said guerrillas shot down four Iraqi helicopter gunships in
the last few days and killed or wounded 7,000 government troops in
recent fighting. Kurdish casualties were listed as 250 guerrillas
and 1,900 civilians killed, with 5,000 civilians wounded.
   The spokesman said the Iraqis have not been able to seal off the
border with Turkey. This is the only escape route for civilians.
   In a separate statement, Kurdish Democratic Party leader Massoud
Barzani denied press reports that he had sought asylum in Turkey.
   ``Our decision is to remain with our beleaguered people ... and
to continue our resistance for the survival of the Kurdish people.''
   About 20 million Kurds lived in the mountainous region where the
borders of Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria meet.
   Kurdish rebels joined forces in November 1986 and launched an
increasingly effective campaign against Baghdad.
   Iraq's intensified operations against the Kurds came after an
Aug. 20 cease-fire with Iran took effect.

   Australian journalist Sam White, the Paris
correspondent for London's Evening Standard newspaper for more than
40 years, has died in the French capital at age 77.
   Linda White, his daughter-in-law, said the journalist died
Sunday in a clinic where he was receiving treatment for respiratory
problems.
   White continued his weekly column until shortly before his death.
   During World War II, White reported for Australia's Sydney Daily
Telegraph. He covered in the 1944 invasion of Normandy and entered
Paris with the U.S. Army.
   After the war, White returned to Austrialia briefly but soon
came back to Europe. He began working for the Evening Standard in
1947.
   In Paris, he became a familiar sight in the Crillon bar, where
he had his own telephone, and visiting journalists were often taken
there to be introduced to him. Later, the Travelers' Club became
his base.
   Despite his inability to master the French language, White had
an extraordinary range of contacts in France and regaled his
readers with a column of gossip about society, the arts and the
underworld, combined with shrewd analysis of French politics.
   He also wrote for the British weekly Spectator and visited
London occasionally to watch cricket at Lord's.
   White was born in Kiev in the Ukraine, from which his family
fled during the Bolshevik Revolution to Australia, settling in
Melbourne. He was educated at Melbourne University and joined the
Australian Communist Party, but was expelled for ``bourgeois
bohemianism.'' He came to Britain at the end of the 1930s.
   White had two sons by his first marriage and a daughter by his
second.

<HEAD>U.S. Governors Appeal For Japanese Investment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three governors met with Japanese officials today
and appealed for more Japanese investment in their states to help
with economic hardship.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer and
Mississipi Gov. Ray Mabus said their states had been hit by
declines in manufacturing and the oil industry, but were rich in
assets that the Japanese need.
   The three Democrats met with Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to
urge increased Japanese investment, and also met with officials of
the Japan External Trade Organization, the Japan-Southern U.S.
Association, and officials of the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
   Roemer said the tri-state region is rich in oil and natural gas,
timber, agricultural products and seafood, all products Japan needs
and that can be transported through the states' six seaports.
   Clinton said the states are interested in attracting Japanese
chemical, electronics and auto parts manufacturers. Although the
three states already attract more than $20 billion in foreign
investments _ most of it from Canada and Europe _ almost none comes
from Japan.
   Mabus said Mississipi is offering incentives such as property
tax exemptions, low-interest or no-interest loans and tax credits
for high-technology jobs.
   ``We can build roads, railroads, and ports at state expense. We
have a number of buildings ready to be leased or purchased,'' he
added.
   Clinton said Arkanasas was willing to pay air fares for workers
to travel to Japan to retrain, if necessary.
   The unemploylment rate is 7.2 percent in Arkansas, 7.5 percent
in Mississippi, and 11 percent in Louisiana.

<HEAD>Former Policeman Releases Hostage, Ends 25-Hour Standoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former policeman convicted in a pension fund
scandal surrendered after holding a police official hostage at
gunpoint for 15 hours and then keeping authorities at bay for
nearly 10 hours more.
   Anthony Daniele, 39, claimed that he was willing to die to show
he was innocent of involvement in a scheme to defraud the police
pension fund.
   ``If I had been involved in something like that, I shouldn't go
to jail, I should be shot,'' Daniele said in an interview with a
newspaper columnist shortly before he surrendered Sunday.
   Daniele, who was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison, took
John Frank, vice president of the city police board, hostage about
10:30 a.m. Saturday. Daniele was free on bond pending appeal.
   Frank had been instrumental in exposing the kickback scheme that
cost police and fire pension funds an estimated $330,000. Daniele
formerly headed the police pension fund.
   Besides the prison sentence, Daniele was ordered to make
restitution of $200,000. He was one of six men indicted but the
only one to stand trial; the others pleaded guilty to lesser
charges.
   The ordeal began when Daniele walked into Frank's law office on
the 15th floor of a downtown office building, displayed a
.38-caliber revolver and took Frank hostage.
   Daniele apparently wanted to convince Frank of his innocence and
get media attention for what he regarded as an injustice in his
conviction and sentence, officials said.
   The former policeman released Frank at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday.
He ended the standoff at about 11 a.m. after reaching agreement
with police that he would not be charged in the hostage-taking,
said his lawyer, Donald Wolff.
   U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Dittmeier said it was his decision not
to prosecute Daniele. But Circuit Attorney George Peach said he had
made no promises and would have to review the case before making a
decision.
   Before surrendering, Daniele asked to speak to Bill McClellan, a
columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch who had covered the
police department and had written about the pension fund case.
   ``I should be hung. I wanted my brother officers to know I'm
innocent. I was willing to die to let them know it. I was willing
to go out of here in a body bag,'' Daniele told McClellan.
   Daniele was taken to the medical facility at the federal
penitentiary in Springfield, Mo., where he will undergo a
psychiatric evaluation, authorities said. Wolff said Daniele was
remorseful about the hostage-taking.
   Dozens of police officers and firefighters surrounded the office
building during the standoff while a team of negotiators kept in
touch with Daniele by telephone from another floor of the building.
   Reports that Daniele might have a bomb or had booby-trapped the
door to Frank's office with explosives turned out to be false,
police said. But the police team's work was complicated by the fact
that Daniele, an 18-year police veteran and former rifleman on the
hostage team, knew their techniques.

<TEXT>
   With solemn ceremony, opposition leaders
today paid tribute to the thousands of ``martyrs of democracy''
killed by security forces attempting to quell the nationwide
uprising against 26 years of one-party rule.
   About 50,000 people gathered in suburban Rangoon on the west
bank of Inya Lake, where opposition groups say police killed and
brutally assaulted students during demonstrations March 17.
   Meanwhile, residents of a Rangoon suburb said today at least 20
people, including two Buddhist monks, died during a confrontation
between looters in a government biscuit factory and members of a
``vigilence committee.''
   ``Vigilence committees'' are among the informal groups formed to
maintain order and handle routine administration in areas where the
government has been ineffective in wake of anti-government protests.
   Residents said members of the ``vigilence committee'' rushed to
the biscuit factory Sunday in South Okkalapa to stop a reported
theft but instead were captured by the looters.
   Residents surged into the factory and, discovering eight members
of the committee had been killed, set upon the thieves. The mob
reportedly killed 12 people.
   Also today, the All Burma Students Union printed what it said
was an official directive to military intelligence agents and their
informers.
   ``Under prevailing conditions in the country, intelligence units
and their informers must use various methods to cause fear and
confusion among the public,'' said the directive.
   A newsletter published by the students union said the directive
was issued Aug. 22 by the head of military intelligence. The
authenticity of the directive could not be independently verified.
   Some Western diplomats in Rangoon have speculated the government
is trying to push the country toward anarchy to justify a military
takeover.
   At least six armed officers identified as members of military
intelligence were apprehended by protesters last month and
reportedly acknowledged being ordered to carry out bombings and
other sabotage to create chaos.
   Meanwhile, about 400 employees of the state radio and television
_ the last major media under full official control _ went on strike
today to protest the suspension of 14 colleagues.
   ``Our strike can greatly disrupt normal operations, but they can
go on with a skeleton staff,'' strikers in the Information and
Broadcasting Department said. The department has about 650
employees.
   The 14 officials were suspended for taking part in
anti-government protests last month.
   The March violence inflamed a public already disillusioned with
political repression and economic deterioration. Another major
demonstration flared in June and unrest has continued over the past
two months.
   ``My young sons and daughters whose names I had no chance to
know,'' said opposition leader Aung Gyi, addressing the students
killed in March. ``Your courage and sacrifice for the cause of
democracy has been recognized, and you all will be remembered as
martyrs of democracy both in the history of Burma and abroad.''
   Referring to those killed by military forces last month, the
retired general said: ``Thousands from various walks of life _
monks, students, workers, doctors and nurses _ have also followed
you for the same cause.''
   The opposition has called for a nationwide strike Thursday to
press the government for immediate democracy rather than wait for a
congress of the ruling party Sept. 12. President Maung Maung has
promised the congress would pave the way for a multi-party system
after a referendum is held.
   ``The whole country has demanded immediate formation of an
interim government to ease the situation. The government has to
face the reality,'' Aung Gyi told visiting Rep. Stephen Solarz,
D-N.Y., in Rangoon on Sunday.
   Solarz later told reporters in Bangkok, Thailand, that Burma was
on the ``dawn of a new era of democracy'' but warned that hardline
government and military moves could still cause a civil war.
   ``I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the fate of
Burma hangs in the balance,'' he said.
   Solarz suggested the exile of Ne Win, the military leader who
seized power in 1962, and other top government leaders would help
defuse the situation.
   Western diplomats say at least 100 people were killed in the
March riots, while about 1,000 died last month in the capital
following the retirement of Ne Win and his replacement by hardliner
Sein Lwin.
   Upon Sein Lwin's accession to power, Aung Gyi and some of his
associates were arrested and jailed. They were released when Sein
Lwin was replaced on Aug. 19 by Maung Maung, the first civilian
leader in Burma in 26 years.

   Two cold fronts scattered rain in the eastern half of the nation
today but most of the West was hot and dry. A downtown temperature
of 110 degrees tied the hottest day ever recorded in Los Angeles.
   Hawaii was out from under tropical storm alerts and hail piled
so deep in Wisconsin that a snowplow was put into service.
   Rainfall subsided in the deep South early today after as much as
5 inches of rain fell in sections of Alabama during the weekend.
   A tropical storm watch was canceled in the Hawaiian Islands as
Hurricane Uleki moved westward away from the islands, weakening
gradually.
   Hot, dry weather continued in much of California and the
Northwest, with several record highs on Sunday. The 110-degree
reading in Los Angeles tied a record set Sept. 1, 1955, the hottest
day in the city's history. The temperature at San Diego's Lindbergh
Field reached 107 degrees, breaking a 1961 record for the date.
   A snowplow was dispatched to clear hail from three intersections
as a Labor Day weekend storm deposited as much as 18 inches of the
icy stuff on parts of Milwaukee.
   Strong winds from the north later Sunday churned waves to an
estimated 12 feet on the open waters of Lake Michigan, officials
said.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
ahead of a cold front over the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast
region; thunderstorms scattered across Florida; showers developing
ahead of another cold front across Pennsylvania and New York into
New England; cloudy to partly sunny skies over the Great Lakes
states and upper Mississippi Valley; and for mostly sunny skies
elsewhere.
   Highs will be in the 50s in northern Michigan; 60s in much of
the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes states, western
Pennsylvania and New York and northern New England; 90s in the
Florida Peninsula and Pacific Northwest; 100 to 110 in the desert
Southwest; and 70s to 80s in most of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m EDT ranged from 43
degrees at Grand Forks, N.D., Yellowstone, Wyo., Sault Ste. Marie,
Mich., Wausau, Wis., and Custer, S.D., to 87 at Bakersfield,
Calif., and Phoenix and Yuma, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   Talks on a new U.S. bases agreement broke
off today after Greek negotiators announced the U.S. Air Force base
next to Athens Airport will be closed, the government said.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said the American side
asked that the talks be temporarily postponed following the Greek
announcement.
   ``The American delegation requested a temporary postponement in
order to return to Washington and take relevant instructions from
the American authorities,'' Kostopoulos said in a statement.
   The statement did not say when the talks would resume.
   No U.S. Embassy spokesman could immediately be reached because
of the Labor Day holiday.
   The postponement came on the opening day of a ninth round of
negotiations for a new Greek-American defense cooperation agreement
to replace a 1983 accord expiring in December.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government said last
month that Hellenikon Air Base would be shut down. At that time,
the United States said its future was still under discussion.
   Hellenikon is one of four American bases that have operated in
Greece since the 1950s. It provides support for planes monitoring
Soviet naval operations in the Mediterranean and for another three
U.S. bases here.
   About 1,400 American servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700
Greeks work at the base, located next to Athens International
Airport.
   The Greek government has so far made no threat to close any
other base, but says Hellenikon's operations cannot be transferred
to another U.S. installation.
   There had been speculation here that a U.S. Navy base at Souda
Bay on the southern island of Crete could be expanded to replace
Hellenikon.
   The other American bases in Greece are a Navy communicatons base
at Nea Makri near Athens which tracks Soviet naval and submarine
activity and an electronic surveillance base at Gournes, also on
Crete.
   As a form of rent for the bases, Greece receives $340 million
annually in U.S. military credits.
   Talks for the new defense cooperation agreement started last
November but the regular monthly meetings have made little progress.
   The main obstacle appears to be Greek insistence that in return
for a new bases agreement the United States should help toward
solving Greek-Turkish disputes over military control of the Aegean
and the divided island of Cyprus.
   Papandreou also says a new agreement will be submitted for
approval in a referendum before it takes effect.
   In July, the government issued a formal closure notice for all
four bases, but it doesn't necessarily mean the bases will stop
operating.
   If the Greek and American negotiating teams fail to reach
agreement, the current accord gives the United States 17 months to
dismantle the bases after the date the accord expires.
   U.S. officials in Washington have said they would like to wrap
up a new bases agreement by December. But the government spokesman
warned again on Sunday that the talks are likely to be lenghty.
   ``We've said repeatedly the talks can't be quick and easy. We
predict they will be long and painful,'' Kostopoulos said in a
statement.

<HEAD>50-Block Power Outage Ends In Downtown Seattle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Power was restored to all but one building today
in a 50-block area of downtown that was left without electricity
for three days by a fire in underground feeder cables.
   Seattle City Light workers completed repairs to a fifth
13,000-volt cable Sunday night, utility spokesman Scott Forslund
said. Repairs to the sixth and last burned out cable should be
completed today, he said.
   Until the sixth cable is back in service, many buildings will
have only partial power because they are served by a combination of
the repaired and unrepaired cables, said Hugh McIntosh of City
Light.
   The last building without service was a parking garage with some
office space near the fire site, Forslund said.
   Frozen food thawed, elevators wouldn't budge and air
conditioners were useless during one of the hottest weeks in city
history after service was cut Wednesday by a fire in an underground
transformer and switching vault.
   About half the affected customers began getting power Saturday
evening when the switch was thrown on four repaired feeder cables
and other customers were hooked up during the night.
   The cause of the outage was undetermined but City Light
superintendent Randall Hardy said the fire apparently started in
the municipal utility's cables.
   Power to those feeders should have been cut by current limiters
that act when a cable gets hot.
   In addition, power continued flowing through an adjacent
aluminum supply cable for overhead electrical trolley bus lines.
   That cable melted, ``so what you had was molten aluminum cutting
our cables'' Hardy said Sunday night.
   Had it not been for the lack of a power cutoff on the transit
cable, Hardy said, it would have been ``a two-building outage of a
day or so.''
   As power restoration began, fire crews roamed the area to make
sure no fires were triggered in equipment left switched on when the
outage began.
   ``It went very smoothly. I have no reports of problems other
than the sprinker in the Battery Street tunnel,'' which apparently
began wetting down the tunnel when it was tripped by the power
surge, McIntosh said. ``We called the fire department and told them
it was their problem.''
   At the Westin Hotel, full service was restored to the 40-story
south tower early Sunday, while the 47-story north tower remained
on a diesel generator, rented for $6,200 a week, marketing director
Dell Schooly said.
   City Light officials had no estimate of costs to restore power
or repair damage, but McIntosh said he understood the City Council
would consider a special appropriation.
   During the height of the blackout, city officials estimated that
90 percent of all businesses were closed in the area, which has an
estimated 130 restaurants, 55 shops in the popular Pike Place
Market, the Bon Marche department store and uncounted hotels,
grocery stores and taverns.
   The blackout coincided with a heat wave in which Friday's
temperature was 98 degrees, a record for September, and Saturday's
high 92, a record for the date. Sunday was in the low 80s.

<HEAD>Mail Strike Spreads In Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of British postal workers were
on strike today, halting some 100 million letters and parcels, in a
work stoppage over regional bonuses and the hiring of temporary
workers.
   Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the Union of Communications
Workers, said more than 40,000 of its members in the Post Office
were striking Sunday and the whole system could be brought to a
halt by midweek.
   The Post Office, which employs 140,000 people and handles 51
million items a day, said 28 major city center sorting offices were
on strike, affecting 100 million letters and parcels.
   In affected areas, mail cannot be collected, sorted or
delivered. London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh and
Glasgow are among the affected cities. Overseas mail has almost
stopped because the two sorting offices which handle it are on
strike.
   The postal strike began Wednesday as a 24-hour walkout to
protest regional pay bonuses _ an issue that remains unresolved.
The strike has continued in various parts of the country to protest
the bonuses and the hiring of temporary workers to clear the
backlog of mail caused by Wednesday's strike.
   The union objects to the Post Office offering weekly bonuses of
7.5 pounds to 20 pounds ($12.52 to $33.40) to recruit workers in
London and southeast England. Those regions are prosperous, and the
postal service has difficulty hiring workers.
   The union said it would not tolerate regional pay differences
and any bonuses should be paid nationally.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today celebrated Labor Day
by denouncing George Bush as the leader of the party of the rich
and asking voters to ``look in the mirror'' and ask whether they
can afford four more years of Reagan-era indifference.
   Dukakis, on the workers' holiday that marks the traditional
start of the fall presidential campaign, began the day visiting
families in a working-class neighborhood of Philadelphia and then
headed for Detroit and a rally in the auto capital with labor
chieftains and Michigan's Democratic leaders.
   Some 125 anti-abortion activists, by police estimates, staged a
protest at his Philadelphia stop, waving signs and chanting, ``Life
yes, abortion no. Duke of death must go.''
   The Massachusetts governor, in his chat with the Philadelphia
residents, ridiculed Bush's call for a ban on ocean dumping.
   ``I don't think Mr. Bush gets it. We want to stop ocean dumping,
right? That means we've got to treat the sewage, right? ... But you
can't be for an end to ocean dumping when you're also for ending
federal grants for sewage treatment,'' said Dukakis.
   ``Mr. Bush went up to New York and said `I'm for ending ocean
dumping by 1991.' So am I. But how are we going to pay for it?''
Dukakis asked.
   He also hit Bush on housing, saying, ``I don't think I've ever
heard Mr. Bush talk about housing, have you? ... He hasn't. He
doesn't appreciate what average folks are going through.''
   Dukakis, in the text of his speech to the Detroit rally, said
Bush wanted to help the ``privileged few'' get richer while making
it harder for middle class families to send their children to
college.
   ``The election is a choice etween two kinds of leadership, two
ideas about prosperity and two visions of America,'' Dukakis said.
``For the past seven years, as the Census Bureau told us this past
week, the rich have gotten richer; the poor have gotten poorer; and
those of us in the middle _ and that means most of us _ are getting
squeezed.
   ``My friends, I ask you, can we afford four more years of that?''
   Dukakis questioned Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle's qualifications to
be vice president or president while praising his running mate,
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, as a leader who had proven his compassion
by sheperding trade and plant-closing legislation through the
Senate.
   And he lashed out at Bush's proposal to cut the capital gains
tax, which Dukakis said could give a $30,000 tax break to those
making more than $200,000 a year.
   ``That's more than the average teacher makes,'' Dukakis said.
``That's enough to send your son or daughter to Michigan State for
four years. The down payment young couples could use to buy their
first home.
   ``And who do you think is going to pay for that new tax break?''
Dukakis asked. ``Look at your kids. Look at your parents. Look in
the mirror and ask yourself, can we afford four more years of
that?''
   Dukakis also took Bush to task for calling the rise in national
unemployment reported last week ``statistically irrelevant.''
   ``That's an interesting phrase,'' Dukakis said. ``But not
surprising, coming as it did from the standard bearer of the party
that thought ketchup was a vegetable. My friends, we're here today
to tell Mr. Bush that Americans are not statistics, and we sure
aren't irrelevant.''
   Dukais recalled his Saturday trip with his immigrant mother to
Ellis Island and paid tribute to the nation's ethnic diversity.
   ``We are a wonderful and diverse mosaic of races and creeds and
ethnic groups bound together by our love for this country; by our
belief in its future; and by our deep and abiding faith in the
American dream,'' he said.
   ``And if anyone tells you that that dream belongs to the
privileged few, and not to all of us, tell them that their era is
over and a new era is about to begin.''
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and United Auto Workers
President Owen Bieber were joining Dukakis at the Detroit rally, as
were Mayor Coleman Young, Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard and Sens.
Carl Levin and Don Riegle.
   From there Dukakis was heading to St. Louis to join Bentsen,
Rep. Richard Gephardt and a host of Missouri state and local
officials at a Labor Day barbecue.

<HEAD>Police Say Moslem Cleric To Be Indicted On Incitement Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today they plan to indict a Moslem
cleric on incitement charges for allegedly urging worshipers to
fight Jews working at an archaeological dig near two sacred mosques
in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Mohammed Jamal, deputy head of the Supreme Moslem Council, or
Waqf, would be the highest-ranking Moslem official to be tried by
Israel since it captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories, Israel has jailed at least 20 Moslem
officials, including preachers, teachers and mosque guards.
   In a telephone interview, Jamal told the The Associated Press:
``What I did is not incitement. It is the right of Moslems to come
to their holy place and defend it. I would do this again.''
   The cleric also threatened to ``make trouble'' if he was taken
to court, but he did not elaborate.
   At issue were clashes July 3 in which riot police fired tear gas
and rubber bullets at hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians
enraged by the archaeological dig near the Temple Mount, known in
Arabic as Haram esh-Sharif. The mount houses two of Islam's holiest
shrines, the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques.
   Using mosque loudspeakers, Moslem officials urged Palestinians
to rush to the site and defend the shrines, saying Israelis planned
to dig a tunnel to the Temple Mount.
   Israeli officials denied the charges, saying the dig was
designed to open an underground staircase running along the Western
Wall, Judaism's holiest site. The Western Wall, the last remnant of
the Second Temple, borders the Temple Mount.
   Israeli officials acknowledged they did not coordinate the dig
with the Waqf, and excavations were suspended temporarily.
   Officials now plan to draw up an indictment against Jamal for
his role in the clashes, said Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy.
Police said the charge carries a maximum three-year penalty.
   Levy also confirmed today that Hatem Abdul Khader, managing
editor of the Arabic daily Al Fajr, was arrested and ordered held
for six months without trial. He would not elaborate.
   More than a dozen police officers raided Al Fajr's east
Jerusalem office Sunday night and arrested Khader.
   ``We consider this an illegal step, an aggression against Al
Fajr and all Palestinian journalists,'' said Khaled Abu Aker, one
of the editors of the pro-Palestine Liberation Organization
newspaper.
   Since the beginning of the uprising, dozens of Palestinian
journalists have been detained by Israeli authorities.

<HEAD>No Progress Reported In 12th Day of Iran-Iraq Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials today reported no progress in the 12th
day of U.N.-sponsored talks on ending the Iran-Iraq war.
   Spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson
first met late Sunday with the Iraqi side, minus Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz, and then this morning with the Iranians, likewise
without Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati. While results remain
elusive, ``Work is continuing,'' she said.
   The Iraqi and Iranian foreign ministers have not met since the
second day of the talks. On Saturday, Aziz described the talks as
``still in square one.''
   Meanwhile, foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council met
today for a second day in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for discussions
focused on breaking the deadlock in Geneva. The council members are
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab
Emirates.
   Saudi Arabia's Al-Sharq Al-Awsat newspaper today quoted council
sources as saying members of the security and economic alliance in
the oil-rich Persian Gulf region ``are serious about entering as
indirect partners in the Geneva negotiations, even if it's in the
final stages.''
   The problems that have bogged down the Geneva talks include
troop withdrawals, freedom of navigation, border questions and the
status of the Shatt al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Iran has also called for an inquiry to establish who started the
war, one of the provisions of Security Council Resolution 598,
which is the basis for the Geneva talks.
   Fighting halted Aug. 20 after nearly eight years of fighting
when a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect after Iran
unconditionally accepted Security Council Resolution 598 calling
for a truce.
   Iran says the war started Sept. 22, 1980, when Iraqi troops
invaded Iran. But Iraq marks the anniversary on Sept. 4, when Iran
shelled Iraqi territory.

   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson was
recuperating today from minor head and chest injuries after
apparently being knocked out in a single-car accident near his
upstate training camp.
   Tyson's BMW apparently skidded on a wet road Sunday morning,
said a spokesman for the boxer, Dan Klores, who gave no other
details of the crash.
   A witness said the accident occurred while Tyson was driving his
car out of the yard at his adopted family's home in Catskill and it
skidded and slammed into a tree. He was found, apparently
unconscious.
   ``Mike was just leaning back in his car seat and I took his
pulse,'' said Yvonne Conrad, a niece of Camille Ewald, whom Tyson
has been close to since he began training in Catskill eight years
ago.
   ``He was normal, his breathing wasn't heavy or labored. I didn't
hear anything wrong with him. We just couldn't arouse him. We tried
to wake him up by asking `Mike, Mike,' and we just couldn't get
anything from him,'' Conrad said.
   Tyson, Ewald said, ``had (the car) parked on the grass side of
the driveway. It was very squishy there because of the rain and the
wheels kept spinning around, chewing into the dirt. He finally got
it going and it skidded straight into a tree, bounced off and went
into some shrubbery sideways.''
   ``When I opened the car door, his head was slumped backward. I
slapped him on the cheek to wake him. He opened his eyes, and said,
`Camille, Camille, what happened?' Then he went out again,'' she
told The New York Times.
   Tyson and his trainer, Cus D'Amato, lived at Ewald's house for
several years while the Brooklyn teen-ager was learning to box. He
returns to the house regularly to visit Ewald, who is 83.
   Tyson, who was recovering from a broken bone in his right hand
suffered in a street fight two weeks ago with heavyweight Mitch
Green, was taken to two upstate hospitals before being transferred
Sunday night to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center here.
   Ewald said Tyson's wife, actress Robin Givens, and his
mother-in-law, Ruth Roper, wanted Tyson taken to the New York City
hospital.
   Tyson was hospitalized for observation and diagnostic tests,
said Dr. Carolyn Britton of Columbia Presbyterian. ``He suffered
minor trauma to the head and the chest wall,'' Britton said, adding
that Tyson's condition was stable. ``He's neurologicallly normal.''
   When Tyson arrived in New York City, Givens tried to keep
waiting photographers away from her husband. As cameramen pressed
forward, Givens pushed them back, shouting, ``Give him a break.''
   Tyson, whose championship bout against British champ Frank Bruno
was recently postponed until Oct. 22 because of the hand injury,
was scheduled to accompany his wife to the Soviet Union on
Wednesday.
   In his last fight in the ring on June 27, Tyson knocked out
previously unbeaten Michael Spinks in 91 seconds, earning $22
million.
   It was not known whether the car accident would affect Tyson's
next fight.
   Bill Cayton, Tyson's manager, said the cast on the fighter's
right hand was removed on Thursday and a splint was placed on it.

   The confirmed death toll rose to 18 today as
emergency crews worked to open roads and deliver supplies to
communities isolated by flooding after two hurricanes, officials
said.
   The government newspaper El Nacional, citing preliminary
reports, said 27 people died.
   Much of the southern half of the country was affected by
hurricanes Debby and Kristy _ from Veracruz on the east to the west
coast resorts and Chiapas on the border with Guatemala.
   Officials said most of the victims were killed in mudslides or
were swept away by swollen rivers. An estimated 50,000 people were
evacuated from their homes.
   Hurricane Debby struck on Friday. Kristy affected the Pacific
coast for several days, but never hit land and moved out to sea.
   In Veracruz, about 150 miles northeast of Mexico City, about
25,000 people were left homeless, state government spokesman Raul
Torres said Sunday. As many as 10,000 residents of Alamo were
forced to leave their homes, Torres said
   He said three people died in the town of Poza Rica and three in
nearby Papantla.
   In the central state of Hidalgo, a mudslide crushed three houses
in the mountain community of Ixtlahuaco, about 100 miles northeast
of Mexico City, killing four people and injuring 16 others,
according to 2nd Commander Florencio Gutierrez Hernandez, a State
Public Security Department official.
   Three people died while picking corn and tending cattle close to
the banks of flooding rivers in the southern state of Oaxaca, said
Lt. Col. Peregrin Villagomez, assistant public security director.
   On the Pacific coast, five people died in Tapachula, in Chiapas
state at the border with Guatemala, when the Coatan River
overflowed, said Virignia Dorantes, a Red Cross spokeswoman there.
   She said aid was being distributed to those forced to evacuate,
but did not know how many were affected. The government news agency
Notimex said about 20,000 were evacuated in the state.
   Officials said road crews were clearing mud from roads.
   Rain continued to drench the gulf coast and the Pacific coast
from the northwestern state of Sonora south to Jalisco this
morning, the National Weather Service said.
   Streets in parts of Mexico City flooded, choking rush hour
traffic today on some thoroughfares.
   Traffic was moving slowly after 56 mudslides covered a road
between Pachuca and Huejutla, Hernandez said.
   A cracked bridge immobilized traffic for 15 hours over the
weekend on the Pan-American highway near the city of Oaxaca, 230
miles southeast of Mexico City, he said. By late Sunday, automobile
traffic had resumed, he said.
   Tourists were stranded in the resort of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo,
where the airport was flooded and the road south to Acapulco and
north to Lazaro Cardenas was closed to traffic, hotel owners
reported. They said Ixtapa was left without electricity, and some
hotels ran out of emergency candles.
   Medical teams in Acapulco vaccinated children and urged people
to boil water and take precautions with food to avoid disease.

   With the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop, Sen.
Dan Quayle kicked off his fall campaign today with a tribute to the
Pledge of Allegiance and a declaration that the values it embodies
``are not hokey or cornball.''
   ``The people of America want to know the kind of values that
underscore our beliefs, and George Bush and I proudly and
unapologetically embrace the values embodied in the Pledge of
Allegiance,'' the Republican vice presidential nominee said.
   The Republicans have used the pledge as a rallying point in the
campaign, attacking Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
for his 1977 veto of a Massachusetts bill that would have penalized
teachers who refused to lead their classes in the pledge.
   Dukakis cited an advisory opinion by Massachusetts' highest
court that the bill was unconstitutional, as well as a 1943 Supreme
Court decision that students could not be forced to salute the flag.
   But Quayle said that ``the same mindset that would impede the
daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance ... could well
sterilize public education of its proper role as a transmitter of
the values and standards upon which we must rely.''
   For him and Bush, Quayle said, the spirit and values of the
pledge ``deserve to be transmitted to our children.''
   ``To us, they are not hokey or cornball or passe,'' he said.
   Quayle chose Liberty Island, where the statue stands in New York
Harbor, to kick off his fall campaign on this Labor Day holiday.
   He also toured neighboring Ellis Island, where millions of
immigrants entered the country.
   Quayle's speech was briefly disrupted by a group of
demonstrators who chanted, ``Forty-thousand dead from AIDS! Where
was Dan?'' Quayle's supporters surrounded the group and began a
counter-chant, yelling, ``We want Quayle.''
   As the protesters were hustled away, the senator told his
audience, ``I believe in freedom of speech. They have a right to
freedom of speech, but so do I.''
   Quayle also travels to Detroit for an ethnic parade before
returning to Washington to regroup for the heavy campaigning to
come.
   On Sunday, Quayle ended a five-day Southern swing and his second
week of solo campaigning as the Republican vice presidential
nominee.
   ``The South is going for George Bush,'' Quayle declared in
Richmond, Va. as several hundred supporters cheered.
   The Indiana senator was generally well received during his foray
into the South, a region with strong Democratic registration but
which has been Republican territory in presidential contests.
   But there was a smattering of boos Sunday when Quayle was
introduced to NASCAR racing fans in Darlington, S.C., and there
continue to be small protests at some of his other appearances.
   It was a week that saw further refinement of Quayle's themes of
jobs, peace and prosperity and the emergence of his new fall
rhetoric: ``defeatist liberal'' policies of the Democrats versus
the ``enlightened can-do conservatism'' of the Republicans.
   It was also a week that saw a profusion of photo opportunities
for which GOP strategists believe Quayle is particularly suited. He
relished tossing a football with high school players, for example,
and turned it into a metaphor for his campaign. His ``lousy''
passing got better, he noted, just like his own political
performance.
   The controversies about Quayle's military service, personal life
and academic record for the most part did not follow him on this
trip. And Quayle apparently has become more relaxed with the press,
as has his wife Marilyn, who has blamed the media for blowing the
controversies out of proportion.
   But Quayle still has problems at news conferences, aides
concede. He told reporters in Atlanta that he supported a gradual
rise in the minimum wage and then appeared not to know that his
position was different from that of Bush, who opposes an increase
in the minimum wage.
   And he criticized the State Department for what he said was a
reluctance to promote U.S. exports aggressively, but declined to
say in what instances the department had failed.
   Aides said later he was just being cautious, unwilling to get
into specifics from memory.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, visiting a small business
center on Labor Day, today accused Republican George Bush of
neglecting the needs of Texas and the oil industry he once worked
in.
   The Democratic vice presidential nominee, starting a
cross-country Labor Day trek in his home state, told 250
supporters, ``They've sort of turned their backs on us, this
administration has.''
   Speaking outside a former high school converted with government
and Baylor University funds into the Business Resource Center,
Bentsen said the Republicans ``have an oilman who's running for
president. But frankly I can't remember anything he's done for the
energy industry in the past eight years.''
   Bentsen toured the business center and met with local citizens
trying to revive the struggling economy here in this central Texas
town. He said the start up of new business was important because
Texas ``very much needs that kind of diversification.''
   The Texas senator then planned to fly to Beaumont, Texas, to
speak at a Labor Day picnic, before journeying on to St. Louis and
a joint Labor Day picnic with his running mate, Michael Dukakis.
   Bentsen spokesman Mike McCurry said that in a new campaign
speech crafted last week while Bentsen was on vacation, the
candidate would sound the Democrats' campaign themes of economic
patriotism and fairness.
   Bentsen is stopping in Texas on nearly every campaign trip,
fighting to win the state and its 29 electoral votes for the
Democrats even though Vice President George Bush also calls it home.
   The Democratic Party planned to launch new television spots in
the state this week with the message, ``You can't afford to vote
Republican,'' McCurry said.
   Under an unusual Texas law, Bentsen also is running for
re-election to his Senate seat, which he has held for three terms.
That campaign already has aired advertisements.
   After his two Texas stops, Bentsen was flying this afternoon to
St. Louis, where he was meeting up with Dukakis for a Democratic
Club picnic. Missouri is also a battleground, and Bentsen already
had visited the city twice since being picked for the ticket.
   Bentsen's two-day trip was then picking up the job creation
theme on Tuesday with visits to a job training center in
Lawrenceville, Ga., outside of Atlanta, and Virginia Polytechnic
Institute in Blacksburg, Va., before returning to Washington that
night.
   Bentsen arrived in Waco on Sunday after spending four days
relaxing at a friend's ranch in Wyoming. Bentsen played tennis,
rode horses and went fishing, his staff said.

<HEAD>Labor Federation Expels Electricians' Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Trades Union Congress voted
overwhelmingly today to expel the electricians' union, its first
ouster of an affiliate in 15 years.
   Delegates of the electricians' 336,000-member union showed their
disdain by walking out en masse minutes before the Trades Union
took its vote. The vote, by a show of hands, came on the opening
morning of the Trades Union's week-long annual conference in this
south England seaside resort.
   The Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union was ousted
for signing two single-union no-strike deals with management in
violation of Trades Union policy.
   More than 30 single-union no-strike deals have been struck in
Britain, with one union representing all the workers at a plant and
disputes submitted to binding arbitration.
   The Trades Union believes such deals weaken union bargaining
power and lead to competition among unions for representation in a
shrinking job market.
   Some predicted the expulsion would create a ripple effect,
confronting the 9-million member national labor federation with
what The Financial Times called the ``most serious split in British
trade union history.''
   It also raised the prospect of the electricians and other
rebellious unions forming a rival labor federation. Among those
siding with the electricians' union is the Amalgamated Engineering
Union, the Trades Union's second biggest affiliate.
   Delegates shouted down engineers' leader Bill Jordan and the
microphone was cut off when he urged a postponement of the
electricians' expulsion, saying it would inflict ``grievous bodily
harm.''
   Electricians' leader Eric Hammond, in a defiant final speech to
the conference before the vote, accused left-wing unions of
conspiring to bring about the expulsion, spoke of ``witch hunts''
and portrayed his union as a David fighting a Goliath.
   Trades Union General Secretary Norman Willis, addressing the
representatives of the 85 affiliate unions, denied any witch hunt
and said the electricians' union had refused every opportunity to
scrap the no-strike deals.
   The electricians' union was suspended July 8 after accepting
no-strike deals at two plants in Lancashire and South Wales.
Today's vote converted the suspension to outright expulsion.
   In the last expulsion in 1973, 10 unions were ousted for
refusing to oppose government legislation on industrial relations.
Eight of the unions rejoined the Trades Union after the legislation
was repealed.

   To protect themselves
from Palestinian stone-throwers, Jewish settlers operate a radio
warning system and community patrols and even train bus operators
to shoot while driving.
   Many settlers are dissatisfied with army security and their
anger has grown along with the number of Palestinian attacks on
their settlements during the 9-month-old uprising, which has killed
four Israelis and nearly 260 Arabs.
   On Sunday, 200 settlers protested outside government offices
where the Cabinet was discussing whether to allow them to open fire
more freely on the stone-throwers. Authorities have said civilians
may open fire only when their lives are in imminent danger.
   Military jeeps escort local buses on their way through
Palestinian towns and refugee camps, sites of frequent
rock-throwing attacks, and soldiers patrol the areas. But many
residents say present defenses are not enough and have set up their
own forms of protection.
   A radio attack warning center that covers 15 settlements with a
population of 10,000 is housed in the basement of the regional
council in Gush Etzion, south of Jerusalem, said Shilo Gal,
chairman of the council. The center is staffed round-the-clock by
reserve soldiers, most of whom are local residents.
   Small settlements are guarded by one or two armed settlers,
while larger communities are patrolled by jeeps with sirens and
radios, said David Bedein, West Bank settlers' spokesman.
   Israel Television showed how Jewish bus drivers in the West Bank
are being taught self-defense, including driving around roadblocks,
helping passengers to jump through bus windows during a firebomb
attack and caring for the wounded.
   The program showed bus drivers firing pistols from moving
vehicles and trying to drive without flinching while tennis balls
were thrown at their windshield to simulate rock attacks. Gal said
the windows of the buses are being covered with metal grills.
   ``We can't trust the army and it won't allow us to protect
ourselves and our children,'' said Yisrael Maler of the Teqoa
settlement. ``Last Friday, we had to wait for 45 minutes for the
escort. We returned to the bus station, called the army and waited
for another 45 minutes. Not one of us had a gun.''
   Meanwhile, soldiers ``just stand around, look at stone-throwers
and smoke cigarettes,'' said the Soviet-born Maler, who moves
around with an army-issued M-16 rifle. Some of the other settlers
carry pistols.
   Some legislators have expressed concern that settlers given a
green light to fire on stone-throwers would shoot indiscriminately.
   The debate was heightened after a settler accidentally shot and
wounded two soldiers last week when he opened fire at a Palestinian
who threw a firebomb that missed his car.
   But Shilo Gal says the settlers must rely on government patrols
and organized defenses. ``We cannot do more because people would
accuse us of forming militias,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israeli Prime Minister May Visit Budapest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir hopes to visit
Budapest this month and told a visiting Hungarian Cabinet minister
he sought better ties between Israel and the East bloc country,
aides said today.
   Shamir spoke in a meeting with the president of Hungary's State
Office for Church Affairs, Imre Miklos, the highest ranking
Hungarian to visit Israel since Hungary broke diplomatic relations
with the Jewish state 21 years ago.
   Miklos, who arrived Sunday for a four-day visit, told Shamir he
hoped the two countries could renew ties ``when the situation
allows,'' Israel radio reported.
   The Hungarian leader said Sunday his trip signalled the start of
a process that could lead to a resumption of diplomatic ties.
``This is a first step and it will be followed by others,'' he told
reporters.
   Hungary, like the Soviet Union and all the East bloc nations
except Romania, severed ties with Israel during the 1967 Middle
East War. Hungary and Israel resumed low-level diplomatic ties last
year and opened interest offices in March.
   Shamir aide Yossi Ahimeir said the prime minister hoped to visit
Budapest later this month but that final plans had not been made.
   Hungary invited Shamir to avoid appearing to be meddling in
Israeli politics, in light of a visit to Budapest in May by
Shamir's rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the radio said.
   In their meeting, Shamir also praised Miklos for Hungary's
``sympathetic and positive'' attitude toward its Jewish community,
said a statement from the prime minister's office.
   Miklos today visited the Yad Vashem memorial to 6 million Jews
slain by the Nazis during World War II and told reporters, ``We
must all ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.''

<TEXT>
   North Korea pledged on Monday that it will not
disrupt the Olympic Games and said any incident marring the Games
would be part of a U.S.-South Korean plot to create an excuse to
invade the North.
   ``If anything happens in South Korea during the Olympic Games,
it will have nothing to do with us and the United States and the
South Korean authorities themselves should be held responsible for
it,'' the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   ``We hereby make it clear that we do not have the slightest
intention to obstruct the progress of the Games or threaten them by
force of arms,'' said the statement, carried by the state-run
(North) Korean Central News Agency and monitored in Tokyo.
   It said various military exercises planned by South Korea, the
United States and Japan were designed to create tension on the
troubled Korean peninsula and provide an excuse for an invasion of
North Korea.
   The joint maneuvers and exercises are designed to ``cause a
shocking incident and start another war in Korea in case the Games
do not go as they (South Korea and the United States) wish,'' the
statement said.
   The United States maintains 42,000 troops in South Korea and is
planning to station naval ships off the Korean peninsula during the
Games to deter any attacks from outside. The games open Sept. 17 in
Seoul.
   Japanese naval and coast guard ships will patrol waters between
Japan and South Korea to prevent smuggling of weapons, and some of
the U.S. forces involved in the exercises are based in Japan.
   The Korean Central News Agency called the moves ``reckless
military rackets'' which ``are a very dangerous play with fire
which aggravates the situation and increases the danger of war in
this region.''
   North Korea has announced it will not participate in the
Olympics because South Korea and Washington have conspired to use
the Games to divide the troubled Korean peninsula permanently.
   ``If we go to Seoul for the Olympic Games under such
circumstances it will be tantamount to recognizing the U.S.
imperialists' occupation of South Korea and colonial rule ... to
perpetuate our nation's division,'' said Rodong Sinmun, the
official newspaper of the North's communist Workers Party of Korea,
in a separate commentary on Monday.
   The North, South Korea's archrival since the 1950-53 Korean War,
demanded to co-host the Games, but the International Olympic
Committee refused, saying each Olympiad is awarded to only one city.
   In another development, a Japanese news agency reported that
North Korean President Kim Il Sung's second son was recently
appointed ambassador to Hungary to avoid a possible leadership
threat to his older brother.
   Kyodo News Service on Sunday quoted unidentified Japanese
government officials as saying Kim Pyong Il, 34, was
director-general of the North Korean people's armed forces bureau
before being named ambassador.
   It quoted unidentified Eastern European sources as saying Kim Il
Sung's oldest son and designated successor, Kim Jong Il, 46, was
having problems dealing with the nation's stagnant economy and the
controversy over the Games.
   Because of Kim Jong Il's leadership problems, the sources said,
people were beginning to favor Kim Pyong Il.

<HEAD>Americans Help Bring Order to Liberia's Financial Chaos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite initial skepticism, U.S. officials are
pleased with an experiment in which 17 American financial experts
moved into Liberian government offices to bring order to the
African nation's chaotic financial system.
   Liberia, a country founded by freed American slaves a century
and a half ago, has always had a special relationship with the
United States, and President Samuel K. Doe turned to Washington in
1987 after his fiscal problems ran out of control.
   Corruption was rampant, government checks were bouncing, civil
servants were being paid months late and bureaucrats were spending
money without regard to budgetary limits. Some government
contractors were not paid for work performed while others received
checks they were not entitled to.
   In January, 1987, when Secetary of State George P. Shultz made a
brief stop in Monrovia, Doe told him, ``I need help.''
   The two countries worked out a plan to put American accountants,
systems managers and computer experts _ recruited by the U.S.
Agency for International Development _ inside the Liberian
bureaucracy.
   The ``operational experts'' _ nicknamed ``Opex'' _ assumed their
duties in January. Nine of the 17 went to the Finance Ministry.
   ``It's worked reasonably well,'' one U.S. official said, summing
up the eight-month-old experiment. ``The benefits have been
considerable already.''
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, said the two-year
program ``has exceeded the expectations of a lot of people who
thought it would never get off the ground.'' Among other benefits,
civil servants are now being paid on time, he said.
   Another official, also speaking anonymously, said, ``Before
there was no government budget. Everything was entirely ad hoc.
Opex has gotten the Liberians to adhere to the budget. It's under
pretty good control but there are still some financial flows
outside the budget.''
   With the Americans co-signing checks and taking over much of
Liberia's economic management, the plan gives the appearance of a
Liberian surrender of sovereignty in a key area, which is a
complaint voiced by Liberian opposition leaders.
   But the State Department says Doe still has the final say on all
financial matters.
   Liberia may be the only country where it would be politically
possible for the United States to play such an intrusive role. But
Liberia, with its red, white and blue flag and its use of the U.S.
dollar as legal tender, has always looked on the United States as a
friend and patron.
   The financial crisis can be traced back about 10 years when the
Liberian government decided to build a $200 million convention
center it couldn't afford. The country fell deeply into debt, and
the problems were compounded in 1980 when Doe, then a 28-year-old
sergeant, took power in a military coup, bringing with him a team
of advisers with no government experience.
   As prices of Liberia's principal exports fell, foreign exchange
earnings dropped. Eventually, because of a poor debt repayment
record, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund declared
Liberia ineligible for new loans.
   Now, as U.S. officials describe it, Liberia's future seems
brighter, and not only because of Opex. Human rights violations are
down, Liberia's press is once again one of the freest in Africa and
there is increased demand for international demand for latex,
Liberia's major export.
   Concern about AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ has
touched off a boom in sales of latex products, such as condoms and
gloves, contributing to the more upbeat mood these days among
Liberians.

<HEAD>Labor, Likud Platforms Call for Direct Talks with Palestinians</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>

   Both major parties have modified their national
election platforms to include support for talks with Palestinians
from the Israeli-occupied territories.
   It is ``a major amendment'' for the right-wing Likud bloc, but
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's political alliance has little
choice because ``Jordan does not appear presently to be a partner
for negotiations,'' Likud legislator Ehud Olmert said in an
interview.
   The center-left Labor Party's new platform also represents a
major shift from its customary position that Israel should
negotiate with King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinians should be
represented in a Jordanian delegation. Labor is led by Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres.
   Hussein forced the platform changes by announcing July 31 that
he would end legal and administrative ties with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the Israeli-occupied lands where 1.5 million
Palestinians and 68,000 Jewish settlers live. An uprising against
Israeli rule began in the territories Dec. 8.
   Avraham Burg, a peace activist and Labor candidate for
parliament, said this week the king's decision was a message to
Israelis and Palestinians ``to make up your minds'' on resolving
problems in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Another reason for the platform changes appears to be Israel's
desire to pre-empt any Palestine Liberation Organization effort to
assume Jordan's role in the territories.
   Likud and Labor have maintained a tenuous coalition since 1984
because neither party won a majority that year in the 120-seat
Knesset, Israel's parliament. How to resolve the conflict with the
Palestinians has become a central factor in each side's effort to
win control in the election Nov. 1.
   The uprising, in which nearly 260 Palestinians have been killed,
is the most sustained revolt to date against Israeli occupation and
lends extra urgency to the campaign. Four Israelis also have been
slain.
   In the past, the Likud linked criteria for peace talks to the
U.S.-brokered Camp David agreement of 1978, which led to the 1979
peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
   The agreement called for Egypt, Jordan and Israel to negotiate
an autonomous Palestinian government in the occupied lands, with
the Palestinians joining later talks on a final resolution.
   Negotiations between Egypt and Israel ended in 1981 and neither
the Palestinians nor Arab states considers the Camp David process a
viable option.
   Olmert, the Likud lawmaker, helped draft the Likud platform and
said ``there is no role for the PLO,'' which Israel considers a
terrorist group, but dovish Labor Party members appear to be
reconsidering that position.
   Burg, the Labor candidate, told Israel radio earlier this week:
``Once the PLO accepts U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, abandons the
ways of terror and recognizes the state of Israel, it won't be the
same entity. Once it is not the same entity it will make me
reconsider my attitude toward it.''
   Those resolutions guarantee Israel's right to exist within
secure borders in return for its withdrawal from occupied Arab
territory.
   The PLO has moved in recent months to modify its stance toward
Israel and, perhaps, win world support for a role in governing the
occupied lands. Bassam Abu Sharif, chief PLO spokesman, has
advocated recognizing Israel and establishing an independent
Palestinian state in the territories.
   In Israel, the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has become
a campaign issue.
   Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's former U.N. ambassador and a Likud
candidate for parliament, said this week: ``The public is concerned
about the problem of staying in the territories, but it is
significantly more concerned about the vulnerability we will invite
on ourselves if we get out of the territories.''
   He said Arab control of the occupied lands might threaten Israel
by providing a ``front door'' for invasion, and such weapons as
shoulder-fired missiles could threaten all Israeli air strips.
   Netanyahu said the uprising should be ended, followed by a
``cooling-off period'' and an autonomy plan that gives Israel
maximum security and the Arab residents minimum interference.

   The younger brother of former
President Chun Doo-hwan was sentenced Monday to seven years in
prison and fined $4.4 million dollars for embezzling millions of
dollars during Chun's administration.
   Chun Kyong-hwan was sentenced by a three-judge panel of the
Seoul District Criminal Court, which also found 11 of his
accomplices guilty of similar charges and gave them prison terms
ranging from one to three years. Six other people were given
suspended terms of up to 1{ years and freed.
   Chun Kyong-hwan, 46, was convicted of diverting more than $10
million in official funds, taking bribes and abusing power to make
illegal profits.
   ``The defendants deserve stern punishment for taking personal
profits by abusing power,'' said Senior Judge Park Young-moo in
rendering the verdict.
   The judge said, ``The defendant, as the younger brother of the
then president who upheld the realization of a society of justice,
actually did what was contrary to that.''
   ``It is our belief that the defendant should not be given
lenient treatment because of his relation to the ex-president.
Likewise, he also should not be punished excessively, simply
because he is the younger brother of an unpopular president,'' he
said.
   The younger Chun was convicted for using his position as head of
the semi-official Saemaul (New Community) development group to
embezzle official funds, extort contributions from businesses and
peddle government influence.
   The prosecution had demanded a 15-year term for Chun.
   Prosecutors said Chun took bribes and embezzled millions while
he headed Saemaul from 1981 to 1987. He was accused of using the
money for stock and land speculation.
   Chun, who wore traditional white Korean clothing and prisoners'
rubber shoes, appeared calm while the judge read a lengthy
statement on the court's decision. After a one-hour hearing, Chun
and the other defendants were led to a bus to be sent back to
prison as guards held off jeering protesters.
   Under Korean law, Chun and the other defendants have one week to
appeal their cases for trial by a higher court. Court sources said
both the defendants and the prosecution are expected to appeal the
sentences.
   In his final testimony, the younger Chun said he did nothing
wrong and claimed that he was being used as a political scapegoat.
   He emerged from obsecurity to head the Saemaul program one year
after his brother seized power with military backing in 1980.
   The former president and his family have come under public fire
for alleged involvement in major financial scandals.
   A parliamentary investigative committee recently demanded the
ex-president and 15 members of his family be forbidden to leave the
country while an investigation into alleged corruption is under way.
   The government imposed a foreign travel ban on some suspects,
but declined to limit the former president's movements.
   The governing Democratic Justice Party has also blocked
opposition attempts to make the former president testify before the
National Assembly.
   Following massive anti-government protest, Chun stepped down at
the end of a seven-year term in February to be replaced by
President Roh Tae-woo, who won presidential elections over rival
opposition candidates in December.

   Leonid Brezhnev's son-in-law went on trial today
charged with taking $1 million in bribes in a court case expected
to expose corruption in the highest Kremlin circles. If convicted,
he could face death by firing squad.
   The trial of Yuri Churbanov, 51, a former first deputy interior
minister, is in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive
to break with the cronyism and corruption now seen as endemic under
Brezhnev, Communist Party chief from 1964 until his death in 1982.
   The case against Churbanov and eight co-defendants, being heard
by a three-member military tribunal of the Soviet Supreme Court,
may also have a political aim _ to discredit remaining members of
the Kremlin Old Guard who flourished under Brezhnev, or to signal
that their time has passed.
   As the reading of the charges began, a court officer said that,
``abusing his official position, (Churbanov) repeatedly took bribes
from Interior Ministry and Communist Party officials in
Uzbekistan,'' the Central Asian republic that has been the center
of the corruption scandal.
   Churbanov, who worked as a mechanic before taking a low-level
Interior Ministry job in 1961, was accused of accepting bribes
totaling 656,883 rubles ($1.04 million), some of them from
co-defendants.
   That sum is the equivalent of 270 years' pay for the average
Soviet factory worker. Churbanov also was accused of accepting a
carpet, tea sets, wine, cognac, grapes and pomegranates that
reportedly were flown to him from Uzbekistan.
   During the reading of the charges, it was repeatedly alleged
that Churbanov received the bribes due to his connection with
Brezhnev, and at one point a co-defendant was quoted as telling
investigators he gave Churbanov money because ``he was a very
influential man.''
   Churbanov is ``an example of the `stagnation period,' when a
person reached high position not because of his merits but due to
his family connections,'' the party daily newspaper Pravda said
last week.
   ``Glasnost and democracy will help to avoid Churbanovism and
anything similar to it,'' Pravda said.
   Court opened at 10 a.m. with Churbanov and the others sitting in
the dock guarded by five young soldiers from the Interior Ministry.
   Access to the courtroom was limited, with only a few foreign
reporters permitted to attend. The Soviet news agency Tass reported
that the eyes of the senior guardsman, in his 20s, ``open wide each
time the figure of another bribe is mentioned.''
   The dark-haired Churbanov, dressed in a gray jacket and
collarless black shirt, was pale, but stared straight ahead, his
head held high.
   Asked by the presiding judge, Army Maj. Gen. Mikhail Marov, to
stand and identify himself, Churbanov spoke in a barely audible
voice. When he said he was a former Communist Party member, Marov
asked him if he had been expelled, and Churbanov answered, ``In
connection with the present case.''
   Churbanov's attorney, Andrei Makarov, accused the prosecutor,
Maj. Gen. Alexander Sboyev, of prejudicing the case against the
accused in an Aug. 14 Moscow News article.
   In an interview published last week by the same newspaper,
Makarov said some Soviet media have made Churbanov a scapegoat for
all the ills of the Brezhnev era, and that the accounts give him
the impression ``that Brezhnev is being tried under the name of
Churbanov.''
   The trial is expected to last at least six weeks.
   Churbanov, who married Brezhnev's daughter Galina in 1971, is on
trial with eight former Uzbekistan officials also accused of taking
bribes: Interior Minister Khaidar Yakhyaev, 61, his deputies Pyotr
Begelman and T. Kakhramanov, and regional police chiefs identified
only as S. Sabirov, Kh. Norbutaev, D. Dzhamalov, M. Norov and Ya.
Makhamadzhanov.
   The trial's first day ended dramatically at 6 p.m. when
Norbutaev, who had complained earlier of feeling ill, suffered an
apparent heart attack. Norbutaev clutched his chest and writhed in
pain as two doctors administered to him.
   The judge then adjourned the session until Tuesday.
   According to Pravda, beginning in the 1970s cotton harvests in
Uzbekistan were padded by almost 1 million tons annually, with the
government made to pay for the non-existent crop by corrupt
officials including Uzbek party boss Sharaf Rashidov, who died in
1983.
   ``Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more
than 4 billion rubles ($6.34 billion) from the state, half of which
they stuffed into their own pockets,'' Pravda reported earlier this
year.
   Churbanov, who held the rank of colonel general in the
Moscow-based ministry responsible for police and law enforcement,
was a power-hungry epicure who became a key actor in shielding the
racket, Pravda claimed.
   Officials announced Churbanov's arrest in February 1987. He was
fired from his top-level Interior Ministry job in 1984, but
reportedly was employed as deputy chief of political administration
for the ministry's uniformed security troops until September 1986.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said last week that
Churbanov may get the death penalty if convicted because he is
charged with serious economic crimes. People sentenced to death by
Soviet courts are shot by a firing squad.

   Better or otherwise, this mousetrap uses
neither springs nor poison. If that doesn't strike your fancy, how
about a kit for making your own four-seater plane? Could you use a
few dozen cow gallstones?
   All this and more can be found in a federal government catalogue
designed to help peddle U.S. goods around the world.
   Among the other novelties listed in the monthly publication
``Commercial News USA'' is a machine for making miniature
doughnuts. And there's genuine Kiowa Indian beef jerky.
   The Department of Commerce sends 110,000 copies every month to
U.S. missions in 140 countries, but does not distribute them in the
United States. The magazine has an index in French and Spanish as
well as English and some missions translate the entire issue.
   The Foreign Agricultural Service of the Agriculture Department
takes inquiries from other countries and makes them available
through computer information networks to Americans with farm
products to sell. Some are published in the Journal of Commerce, a
business daily in New York.
   Earlier in the 1980s, the inquiries included such exotic items
as the cow gallstones _ for use in Chinese medicine _ as well as
four-leaf clovers and turtle eggs. ``Foreign Agriculture,''
published monthly by the department, says it does not know what the
clover and turtle eggs were for.
   It quotes Stan Barrett, one of the department's marketing
specialists, as saying it now prefers to concentrate on more
mundane products like wheat, wood, beef and poultry.
   Last year, the countries with the most requests were Taiwan,
Japan, Britain, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt,
Bahrain, West Germany and Canada.
   Manufacturers pay $150 to get a small black-and-white photo and
a brief description of their product in ``Commercial News USA.''
   The miniature doughnut machine, called ``Lil' Orbits,'' is
considered one of the magazine's success stories. Janet Ebner, its
program director, said in an interview that its mention in the
magazine brought $600,000 worth of business for the manufacturer in
Minneapolis. He had visits from interested agents in West Germany
and Thailand, and negotiations with a Japanese distributor.
   The mousetrap works this way: The mouse crawls in to get the
bait, tips the trap and causes the door to lock behind it. It costs
42 to 50 cents wholesale and can be either reused or thrown away
with the mouse inside.
   The do-it-yourself airplane kit costs $40,000. The manufacturer
claims the resulting plane, when put together from the instructions
that come with it, has a cruising speed of 200 miles an hour, a
range of 1,000 miles and a useful load of 850 pounds.
   Beef jerky is marinated, dried meat in thin pieces about an inch
wide. The word comes from the Quechua Indians in Peru, but the
version now being exported is made by a Kiowa Indian from Oklahoma,
Robert Rowell.
   He sold a contract to Harrods department store in London after
being helped by the Foreign Agricultural Service to exhibit at a
British food show.
   ``It goes well with beer,'' said Dugger Harris, of the High
Value Products Division at the service. ``They drink a lot of beer
over there.''
   Rowell won an award from President Reagan as ``National Minority
Business Person of the Year,'' but then he got into trouble with
British health authorities who disapproved of the quality of the
Oklahoma water used to prepare the beef before it was dried.
   ``That's all right now,'' Harris said in an interview. ``Harrods
is selling it again and he's talking with the Japanese.''

   The House Democratic leadership has stamped a
showcase drug-fighting bill ``bipartisan,'' and is trying to secure
GOP support by permitting votes on conservative-inspired issues
like the death penalty.
   The strategy, devised by Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, could
produce an overwhelming majority for legislation that incumbents
from both parties could use in their election races.
   Debate begins Wednesday, and a final vote could take place
Friday. The Senate will then follow with its own drug bill and the
two versions would eventually be merged into final legislation.
   The bipartisan approach could blunt any Republican plans to
paint Democrats as soft on crime _ a theme already sounded by Vice
President George Bush.
   ``I don't think being tough on drugs means Republicans,'' said
House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., ``Many Democrats feel
just as strongly as Republicans, because we think it's right.''
   House Republicans, on the other hand, won't have to rant and
rave as they often do that Democrats use the rules to keep GOP
proposals from House votes.
   They'll have guaranteed votes on amendments that advance their
political agenda. Many Democrats may join them in some votes. The
key issues will be a federal death penalty, denial of federal
benefits and state driver's licenses to drug users, and a ``good
faith'' exception to admit illegally seized drug evidence.
   The House bill as introduced carries a $1.5 billion to $2
billion annual pricetag, money that would be added to the $3.9
billion a year the federal government is now spending to fight drug
abuse.
   The legislation includes something for everyone involved in
fighting illegal drugs: more money for education, treatment and
rehabilitation; and more resources for state and local law
enforcement efforts to seize drugs on land, in the air and on the
seas.
   But there also are new twists, such as controlling the U.S.-made
chemicals that find their way to foreign cocaine laboratories, and
old controversies, like gun control.
   The bill contains a seven-day waiting period for handgun
purchasers that has become the latest cause for both the gun owner
and pro-regulation groups.
   Gun control organizations argue that a national waiting period
would make it more difficult for drug dealers to obtain handguns,
mainly in the 28 states that now have no waiting period. Pro-gun
organizations protest that only law-abiding citizens would be
harmed by the delay, because criminals would not go to legitimate
dealers.
   The key GOP amendments would:
   _Provide a mandatory death penalty against those who commit
murder in the course of a federal drug felony. One liberal
Democratic alternative calls for mandatory life imprisonment.
   _Allow admission in court of improperly seized drug evidence if
law enforcement officers acted in ``good faith.''
   _Deny student loans, FHA mortgages, rent subsidies and other
federal benefits to convicted drug users until they complete
rehabilitation programs. After rehabilitation, benefits would be
reinstated.
   Another GOP-sponsored amendment, which some Republicans oppose,
would require the revocation or suspension of a driver's license
for those convicted of a drug-related offense. Federal money would
be withheld from states to force compliance.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y. and chairman of the House select
committee on narcotics, said he doesn't care much for the
bipartisan approach. ``Once the leadership said `bipartisan,' the
Republicans wanted these draconian measures,'' he said.
   Rangel said that for conservatives, ``the litmus test for
commitment is the federal death penalty.'' The death penalty now is
applied only for state crimes, because Congress has not adopted the
constitutional standards required to carry out capital punishment.
   However, Coelho predicted that many Democrats would back the
death penalty and suggested the main party split would come over
the GOP plan to deny benefits to drug users.
   To address complaints from local officials who said they never
received promised anti-drug grants, the bill would require states
to automatically pass through anti-drug money to local governments.
   Banking law revisions would allow the government to closely
watch institutions where drug money might be laundered.
   Recipients of federal grants or contracts would need to maintain
a drug-free workplace.
   Money would be provided for drug education, treatment and
rehabilitation for AIDS victims and groups with a high risk of
getting the disease.
   The legislation would authorize $10 million for a Latin American
regional anti-drug force if one is approved by the Organization of
American States.

<HEAD>Congress Expected To Pass Legislation To Combat Medical Waste</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With uncharacteristic speed, Congress is
expected in its final weeks to create a new law to combat what has
become one of the biggest and most emotional problems of the summer
of '88 _ medical waste that has invaded and shut down some of
America's favorite beaches.
   Intense pressure from outraged citizens has driven Congress to
hold a series of public hearings, including one this week on Long
Island's Jones Beach, and at least one measure and maybe more will
be passed before the legislative year ends, lawmakers and
environmental activists predicted.
   Separate measures to create a waste tracking system and to
establish specific criminal penalties for medical waste dumping
passed the Senate before the August recess. Similar measures are
pending in various House committees.
   ``With all the publicity this has gotten, these will sail right
through,'' said John Catena, a science policy analyst at the
Oceanic Society, a national environmental group that focuses on
coastal problems.
   ``The fact that you had one of the hottest summers in 50 years
and tens of millions of people ... were unable to make use of the
public beaches really drew the issue right home,'' said Andy Kass,
a researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, a Democrat who represents part of the
Connecticut coast along the Long Island Sound, said another reason
for the unusual speed on Capitol Hill is the clarity of the issue.
   ``There's no reputable other side of the issue,'' said Morrison.
``No one can excuse the presence of medical waste in the ocean and
the only way it can get there is from illegal dumping. ... There's
not a lot of technical debate here. We know what we can do. Let's
do it.''
   Environmentalists concede that the medical waste problem poses
much less of a long-term health threat than other issues plaguing
the nation's coastal waters, such as sludge dumping, that have
languished in Congress for years.
   ``In terms of long-term survival of the ocean, it's not a
serious problem. In terms of impact on people's lives, it is,''
said Andrew Palmer of the American Oceans Campaign, another
activist group.
   Catena said medical waste simply is ``a much more visible issue.
When it closes your beach down, that makes a lot more rumblings.''
   Many environmentalists see a silver lining in the dirty
syringes, vials, bandages and other hospital debris that has washed
ashore from Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico.
   Palmer said public outrage over medical waste has been
transferred to other less well known but potentially more dangerous
coastal pollution problems.
   ``We're seeing it already, and I think that's being translated
to Congress,'' he said.
   Catena said a bill banning sludge dumping off the New York-New
Jersey shore was passed by the Senate last month because of the
attention surrounding medical waste.
   ``It's helpful, no question about it,'' said Sen. John H.
Chafee, R-R.I., a leader in the medical waste fight in Congress.
``It has probably been the best single item to draw attention to
abuse of the oceans.''
   Since incidents of medical waste pollution began making
headlines around the Fourth of July weekend, the Senate has passed
a measure by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Chafee to require
hospitals, transporters and disposal companies to adhere to a
manifest system that would give investigators a paper trail to find
the source of illegal dumping.
   The pilot program would cover New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut _ states where much of the dumping is suspected of
taking place. A similar measure is pending in the House.
   The Senate also approved amendments to a sludge dumping bill
that would create criminal penalties of up to $250,000 in fines and
five years in prison for illegal dumping. A House subcommittee has
approved a similar measure.
   Other bills still pending would set up a series of rules for the
handling, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of
hospital waste.
   But Catena warned that proper funding levels must be made
available to back up any new laws.
   ``It's great to have a law issued to address a problem, but if
we don't have the money to enforce it, it's not worth the paper
it's printed on,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congressional Bid To Put Lendl On U.S. Olympic Team Fails</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional bid to grant tennis star Ivan
Lendl immediate American citizenship so he could play on the U.S.
Olympic team failed because Czechoslovakian officials refused to
provide waivers for their native son, lawmakers said.
   Lendl, the world's top-ranked tennis player, has lived in
Greenwich, Conn., since 1981 and wanted to represent his adopted
homeland in Seoul this month. ``I am very excited about the
possibilities of playing in the Olympics, Davis Cup and World Team
Cup for America,'' the tennis star said earlier this year.
   Enlisting the help of Connecticut lawmakers, Lendl won House
Judiciary Committee approval in April of a special immigration bill
that would have waived the necessary five-year waiting period and
given him immediate citizenship.
   That was a major victory because Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky.,
chairman of the immigration subcommittee, generally opposes
Olympic-tied immigration bills. Proponents considered the
subcommittee vote Lendl's biggest potential stumbling block.
   But on the House floor, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis.,
blocked the measure and said he would drop his opposition only if
the proponents could secure a guarantee from the Czech government
that it would provide a waiver for Lendl to represent the United
States in the Olympics.
   Olympic rules required a waiver because Lendl previously
represented Czechoslovakia in international competition at the
Davis Cup.
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who represents Greenwich, and
Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, urged Czech officials to grant the waiver. They refused.
   In a terse dispatch to Shays relayed through the embassy, the
Czechoslovak Association of Physical Culture wrote: ``The
Czechoslovak Olympic Committee does not have any reason to agree
with the representation of Ivan Lendl in the team of the United
States at the Olympic Games in Seoul.''
   ``We pressed the issue,'' Morrison said in a telephone interview
last week. ``Maybe we could have (succeeded) with more time, but
... time has basically run out.''
   Morrison said he, Shays and Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn.,
pushed the legislation solely in the hopes of getting Lendl on the
U.S. Olympic team. With that ruled out, legislation to give him
fast-track citizenship will be abandoned.
   Lendl, 28, received his permanent residence status last year. He
will be eligible for citizenship through traditional procedures in
1992. His attorney and spokeswoman did not return telephone calls
last week.
   Tim Mayotte and Brad Gilbert will be the U.S. men's singles
players at Seoul.

<TEXT>
   China's legislature approved the nation's first
law to protect state secrets, a strict regulation that stipulates
life sentences and even the death penalty for violators, it was
announced Monday.
   The law was adopted Monday by the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, which handles the day-to-day affairs of
the congress, the Xinhua News Agency said. The panel then adjourned
a weeklong meeting.
   The 35-article law protects national security and obliges all
citizens and organizations to keep state secrets. The law will go
into effect in May, replacing provisional regulations on state
secrets that were issued in 1951.
   The Xinhua dispatch defined state secrets as ``important
decisions of national defense, diplomatic affairs, secret affairs
concerning the national economic and social development and science
and technology and activities related to state safety and to the
investigation of crime.''
   The law divides state secrets into three categories: strictly
confidential, confidential and secret. Disclosure of strictly
confidential information would seriously damage state safety and
interests, it said.
   Those who steal, secretly gather, buy or illegally provide state
secrets to foreigners or foreign institutions will be sentenced to
between five and 10 years in prison for minor cases.
   In extremely serious cases, the sentence is a minimum of 10
years, life imprisonment or the death penalty, Xinhua said.

<HEAD>Marine Corps Using Living Fence To Boost Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVELOCK, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Always looking for ways to improve
security, the Marine Corps has planted a hedge that will sprout
thousands of razor-sharp thorns said to be strong enough to stop a
speeding jeep.
   About 60,000 bushes bearing the brand name Living Fence have
been planted at the Marine air station at Cherry Point to increase
security around flight lines, storage areas for explosives and the
military kennel.
   ``Once the hedgerow is fully grown, you'd have to use a chain
saw or (explosives-packed) bangalore torpedo to get them out,''
said Lt. Col. Stephen Shivers, provost marshal of Cherry Point.
   The plant's scientific name is trifoliate orange. The bushes,
which grow abundantly in the hills of east Tennessee, sometimes
extend to a height of 20 feet and are used by farmers to protect
cattle and hogs.
   When shrubs mature about five years after planting,
harmless-looking green hedgerows at Cherry Point will conceal 3- to
5-inch thorns that make the barrier nearly impossible to climb over
or cut through.
   ``To enhance our overall security program, we thought we'd give
these bushes a try,'' Shrivers said.
   He said a common nickname for the bush is P.T. ``That stands for
the pain and terror'' inflicted on anyone who tries to break
through the hedge, he said. ``The Marines that work on it have some
unquotable names for it,'' Shivers said.
   The bushes, which are marketed by Barrier Concepts Inc. of Oak
Ridge, Tenn., cost about $1.50 apiece. The marketer boasts they are
strong enough to stop a jeep.
   Cherry Point officials have invested $82,000 in the project.
   Most of the shrubs at Cherry Point were planted about a year
ago. Barrier Concepts officials said the plants last up to 35
years, three times as long as metal barriers.
   Shrivers said the project is a local Marine initiative and
hasn't been ``condemned or blessed'' by his superiors.
   Barrier Concepts officials say the plant's seeds were first
brought to the United States in the 1860s by Chinese coolies
working on western railroads.
   The Chinese didn't use the hedge for security reasons. They used
the thorns for acupuncture.

   A pilot who claimed he was forced
by two masked hijackers to fly them to Austria a week ago actually
helped his brother defect to the West, the news agency CTK reported.
   The plane of the Svazarm paramilitary organization landed Aug.
29 on a field in a village in lower Austria near the Czechoslovak
border.
   But the pilot took it back to Czechoslovakia. He was identified
only as 36-year-old J.C. from Bratislava, a member of the Svararm
airplane club.
   CTK said an investigation showed he took aboard voluntarily his
44-year-old brother, the brother's 6-year-old son and a 39-year-old
woman, all from Plsen.
   The pilot will be prosecuted for ``unlawfully taking abroad a
means of transport'' and for ``assistance in the criminal act of
fleeing from the republic,'' punishable by three to six years in
prison, CTK said.
   The pilot's brother and his companion will be tried in absentia,
said CTK.

   Japanese police said on Monday they have arrested
four Americans and three Nigerians for attempting to smuggle 16
pounds of heroin from Thailand to the United States via Japan.
   A police official said the heroin had a street value in Japan of
19.8 billion yen ($146.7 million).
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japanese
police arrested a Nigerian woman Aug. 24 at Tokyo's Narita airport
for smuggling nearly 10 pounds of heroin into Japan. The next day,
police arrested two other Nigerians at a Tokyo hotel, the official
said.
   The two arrested at the hotel told investigators they were to
deliver the heroin to two American women identified as Joyce
Almarion Crawford, 32, of Georgia and Yanina Florencia Walker, 36,
of Columbus, Ohio.
   After they were arrested, Ms. Crawford told investigators she
planned to receive the heroin and return to the United States with
friends who were to arrive in Tokyo from Bangkok on Friday, the
official said.
   The friends, Brenda Jean Givens, 38, and Ezell Johnson, 35, also
from Columbus, were arrested after they arrived in Japan and
investigators found six pounds of heroin in their bags, the
official said.
   The maximum penalty in Japan for heroin trafficking is 10 years
in prison.

   China's railroads handled 213 million passengers
between July 1 and Aug. 31, an all-time high for the summer peak
season, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
   According to figures from the Railway Ministry, daily passenger
load was 3.44 million people, an increase of 251,000 people from
last year, Xinhua said.
   It attributed the sharp increase in the number of train
passengers to a jump earlier this year in the cost of plane tickets.
   A steady increase in the past few years in the number of Chinese
tourists traveling around China has also contributed to the
passenger load.
   Taiwanese tourists, allowed for the first time in nearly 40
years to visit the mainland, also added to the crush.

<HEAD>New Triangular $2 Coin Very Popular In Cook Islands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Cook Islands introduced the
world's first triangular $2 coin last year, it was advertised as
money from paradise.
   Apparently the campaign worked too well.
   Radio Cooks, monitored in Sydney, said Monday that investors,
mostly from New Zealand, have scooped up virtually all the 90,000
coins that were minted.
   Richard McDonald, director of the Cook Islands Numismatics
Bureau, blamed the run on the widely distributed brochures that
advertised the coin.
   The Cook Islands, population 20,000, is a self-governing
dependency of New Zealand. The coral islands in the South Pacific
lie nearly 1,900 miles northeast of Auckland, New Zealand.

<HEAD>Former Ashland Executive Undecided On How To Use New Wealth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Ashland Oil executive who won a
$16.7 million settlement after charging he was wrongfully fired for
refusing to offer bribes to foreign officials says he has not
decided how to use his wealth.
   The majority of the settlement _ the $12.25 million former
Ashland vice president Bill E. McKay Jr. was awarded for being
wrongfully discharged _ is tax-free.
   He and fellow former vice president Harry Williams filed suit
claiming they were illegally fired for refusing to offer bribes to
foreign officials or to cover up such bribes.
   An eight-week jury trial of their case in Covington ended June
10 with a $69.5 million decision against Ashland, and a finding
that Ashland violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act by engaging in a pattern of illegal interstate
activity to obtain oil in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   Ashland later sought a new trial or a different judgment, and
finally agreed to pay the two men $25 million.
   As part of the settlement, McKay, Williams and the court agreed
to set aside the RICO finding.
   McKay said last week he was still trying to recover from the
stress of intense negotiations that led up to the settlement.
   Among the settlement's numerous terms is one providing that
McKay and Williams cannot portray themselves in any future movie
versions of the case. ``That (point) wasn't hard to give up,''
McKay said.
   After the trial, McKay had said that his expenses were enormous
and that he had been unable to find employment equal to his
six-figure position at Ashland Oil.
   He is paid $50,000 a year as a consultant to Englehard Corp., a
New Jersey company which supplies catalysts to refineries, and he
hopes to land other consulting contracts.
   Williams has moved to Boca Raton, Fla.
   In addition to his share of the $25 million, McKay and his
attorneys received a taxable $2 million for breach of contract.
They also won almost $2.5 million for various expenses; the
agreement did not make clear whether that money was taxable.
   Ashland Oil's $25 million settlement was paid Aug. 26.
   The settlement agreement also gave McKay and his attorneys $1.65
million for expenses related to the case.
   McKay said last week that money did not cover legal fees but was
for related costs such as depositions, copying documents and hotel
bills.
   McKay and Tachau declined to discuss details not included in the
written agreement, such as the attorneys' percentage of the
settlement.
   Tachau's law firm _ Brown, Todd & Heyburn _ had as many as nine
attorneys and several staff members working on McKay's case, Tachau
said. The firm also opened a temporary office in Covington during
the eight-week trial.

<HEAD>Provincetown-Boston, Nation's Oldest Commuter Airline, Officially
Dies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Provincetown-Boston Airlines, the nation's first
regional commuter carrier and once the largest, officially dies
Tuesday.
   In reality, it died four years ago.
   ``What's happening now is like watching a patient catching
cancer,'' said John C. Van Arsdale Jr., who had to resign as PBA's
chairman after the Federal Aviation Administration stripped his
pilot's license in disastrous 1984. ``When the patient dies, it's
merciful.''
   Some industry analysts say the demise of the 39-year-old airline
is an example of how deregulation has crippled small commuter
airlines, partly by spurring fare wars and unchecked growth.
   John Van Arsdale Sr. started the carrier on Nov. 30, 1949, with
just a two-seat Cessna 140.
   Over the years, PBA routinely ran extra planes to Cape Cod and
area resort islands if more passengers showed up, and it grew in
the early 1980s after Van Arsdale turned control over to his
expansion-minded sons.
   Then came back-to-back fatal accidents in 1984. The federal
government shut down the airline because of safety and training
violations. Two weeks after it was flying again, 13 people died in
a crash in Florida. Bankruptcy and takeover followed close behind.
   The bitter Van Arsdale sons say the FAA overreacted to minor
problems. The father says his sons too brashly expanded what was a
cozy and profitable regional service.
   ``We didn't overreact at all,'' said FAA spokesman Jack Barker.
``We reacted properly and in the interest of aviation safety.''
   PBA formally ceases to be an airline Tuesday when its parent,
Bar Harbor Airways of Bangor, Maine, a tiny part of the giant Texas
Air Corp., retires its federal operating certificate.
   PBA's planes are being sold _ including N136PB, a DC-3 flying
since the durable breed went out of production in the 1940s _ and
service on some routes will be reduced or canceled, Bar Harbor
sales director Steven Mason said.
   ``You might lay the whole thing at the door of deregulation,''
said Jon Hurdle, associate editor of Travel Weekly, who has written
about PBA. ``Van Arsdale Jr. was worried about the competitive
effects of deregulation, so he expanded arguably more than he
should have.''
   Over the years, Van Arsdale conservatively expanded service. In
the late 1950s, he worked out a innovative deal with Naples
Airlines in Florida under which the two carriers borrowed each
other's services in the off-season; Naples sent its planes and
crews north in the summer, while PBA's operations migrated south in
winter.
   Then he retired in 1980, turning PBA over to his sons, Peter and
John Jr., who bought more planes, acquired another small airline
and bulked up operations. Flights were added around New England and
the South.
   ``I had reservations,'' said the elder Van Arsdale, 68. ``I felt
they were moving a little too fast. On the other hand, everything
seemed to be going well.''
   By 1983, PBA was the largest regional commuter in the nation. It
carried 220,000 passengers in 1979 and saw its load grow six times
to 1.3 million in the first nine months of 1984, a period in which
PBA reported profits of $3.3 million on revenues of $58.4 million.
   By the end of 1984, PBA had 1,600 employees, 500 daily flights
and 104 planes.
   ``In order to survive in a deregulated environment we had to
grow,'' said John Jr., 43.
   ``They were the envy of some carriers for some time because they
made money,'' said George James, president of Airlines Economics
Inc., a Washington-based aviation consultant.
   Then came the crashes and the FAA scrutiny.
   Public confidence collapsed. Passenger traffic dropped 50
percent in two days, bankers tightened the reins on more than $30
million in credit, the stock plummeted.
   PBA filed for bankruptcy in March 1985. A year later it was
bought for $30 million by People Express, itself now defunct.
   Alfred Kahn, a Cornell University economics professor who headed
the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board when it deregulated the
industry in 1978, disagrees that deregulation is to blame for PBA's
collapse.
   ``Deregulation gave people an opportunity to make money, as some
of them have,'' he said, ``and gave other people a chance to make
mistakes.''

<HEAD>Group Seeks To Establish First Jewish TV Station </HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group wants to start what it believes
would be the first television station in the country that offers a
full slate of programming aimed at a Jewish audience.
   Bridgeways Communications of Westport said its programming would
be cultural rather than religious.
   ``It will not be the Jewish version of the 700 Club,'' said
Michael Vlock, Bridgeways' president.
   The station's target audience would be the 3 million Jews living
in northern New Jersey, metropolitan New York, and Connecticut.
   ``The station is intended to be both a resource and a
celebration of the contributions the Jewish community has made to
society,'' Vlock said.
   While the programs would be designed to appeal to Jews, ``we
want to be attractive to a broader audience as well,'' Vlock said.
   The station plans to offer programming in areas such as the
arts, education, travel, politics, science, history, business and
current events, Vlock said.
   Bridgeways now operates WBCT-TV, Channel 43, a home shopping
channel, which he said was started to preserve the company's FCC
license before becoming a station offering Jewish programming.
   Investors have already raised and spent $3 million to finance
construction of the station's transmitter and antenna, located in
Seymour. An additional $500,000 was just raised to finance
development of the new format.
   Vlock placed the total costs of establishing the station at
about $10 million.
   If Bridgeways is to be successful in its endeavor, industry
experts say it will have to persuade cable companies in the region
to carry the station and convince advertisers that Jews will watch
its programs.
   Vlock and his mother, Laurel Vlock, chairwoman of Bridgeways,
are confident that cable networks will make room for Channel 43.
   ``People are very concerned about their roots. It's a trend in
America in all ethnicities today,'' Laurel Vlock said.
   Said Michael Vlock: ``We offer a large, focused, loyal and
well-educated audience ... what more does an advertiser want.''

   Country singer Randy Travis says that
when he was a teen-ager, singing in front of an audience didn't
bother him, but that was all he could do on stage.
   ``To sing was no problem, but talking scared me to death,'' said
Travis, a former short-order cook who got his start in clubs in his
native North Carolina.
   ``I didn't know what to say. Finally I worked in to saying
`Thank you,' then from there to introducing the song,'' he said.
   He's gotten more comfortable since he hit the country charts in
1986, but says he had another bout of nervousness recently when he
performed in London before rock star Mick Jagger and his girlfriend
Jerry Hall.
   ``You know in his case, he's going to hear every little mistake.
But the show went great and he and Jerry came backstage
afterwards,'' said Travis, 29.
   ``To start with he was a little stand-offish. I guess you'd say
he didn't really know what to say, or didn't want to say anything,
but once we started talking he was very friendly.''

   Fans paid scalpers many times the
normal price for tickets to a single concert by Luciano Pavarotti,
then gave the Italian tenor a 30-minute standing ovation.
   Tickets for Sunday's concert at a 9,000-seat stadium were sold
out a few hours after going on sale last December at prices ranging
from $11 to $65. On Sunday, seats fetched up to $335 outside the
concert.
   Pavarotti sang seventeen songs, including opera arias and
lighter pieces, culminating with an encore of ``O Sole Mio.''

   The Rev. Lawrence M. Jenco, who was held
hostage for 19 months in Lebanon, says he will move to Los Angeles
to join the staff of a Catholic student center at the University of
Southern California.
   Jenco has lived since February at The Grotto, a Marian shrine in
Portland.
   The Roman Catholic Servite priest had been director of the
Beirut operations of Catholic Relief Services for three months when
he was taken hostage by Shiite Moslem guerrillas on Jan. 8, 1985.
His release 19 months later was part of what later was revealed to
have been an arms-for-hostages swap.
   Jenco, 53, said Friday that his move is part of the regular
reassignments in his Roman Catholic religious order. He will join
the pastoral staff of the Newman Center on the USC campus.
   Jenco, who was assigned to Portland in part to provide him a
period of rest after his ordeal, said he accepted the assignment
because he enjoys the challenges of working with college youth and
because of the other challenges in Los Angeles, such as the
homeless.
   ``There are so many things to do,'' he said.

   Former astronaut Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, the second
man to walk on the moon, says he regrets the United States has
fallen behind in the space race and believes Britain should be
doing more in space.
   ``I think it's pretty clear that we have let lapse the space
technology that we had built up,'' Aldrin, now a science
consultant, told a reporter at the Farnborough Air Show.
   ``We must continue to push ahead with the space program ... The
British government must back space exploration,'' said Aldrin, 58.
   Britain is spending $200 million on space research over the next
four years, which a House of Lords select committee said was little
more than half of what was needed.

   Barefoot women, among the millions
of homeless in flooded Bangladesh, clambered from boats Monday onto
the only strip of this village still above water and surrounded
army officers who doled out food.
   They pushed each other in the light rain to get at the giant
cooking pots. They stuffed fistfuls of cooked rice and lentils into
their own pots and bowls, or into the folds of their mud-stained
saris.
   Floods have submerged three-fourths of the nation and claimed at
least 406 lives this summer, according to official figures. Daily
tallies in Dhaka newspapers put the death toll at 1,015.
   More than 92,000 people are known to suffer from diarrhea and
5,715 more from dysentery, the Health Ministry said.
   Taslimur Rahman, joint secretary of the ministry, told reporters
in the capital of Dhaka that people get the diseases by drinking
impure water, often the very flood water that maroons them.
   Officials say water purification tablets are being distributed
but residents of Bailtali, a village of 2,000 people 55 miles
southwest of Dhaka, said they had not seen any.
   ``The water that is available to drink is the flood water. We
have no option but to drink it,'' Injul Haq Majumder, a 37-year-old
teacher, told reporters who arrived by helicopter.
   He translated his reply from English to Bengali for villagers
who crowded around. A dozen men nodded vigorously in agreement.
   Only two short strips of road, totaling about 500 yards,
remained above water in Bailtali.
   One was covered with makeshift shelters of bamboo poles and palm
thatch, and the other was bare as two air force helicopters
descended through the rain, except for the food kettles.
   Round holes were punched into the mud along the road and bamboo
poles lay nearby. An army officer, who would not give his name,
said temporary shelters were dismantled so the helicopters could
land.
   More than 100 small fishing boats, carrying two to 10 people
each, bobbed beside the road in flood waters that had engulfed
power lines and left only the tips of poles and a few loops of wire
visible.
   People throughout Bangladesh are huddled on tiny outcroppings of
muddy earth like those at Bailtali.
   The largest bit of land seen during a helicopter tour Monday
that covered one-tenth of the country was about the size of a
football field.
   ``Almost all the districts are like this. Don't think this is
the worst,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told a dozen
foreign journalists who accompanied him on the flight.
   Rahman said 50 of the country's 64 districts and 25 million of
its 110 million people have been ``directly affected'' by floods
that began in June with the annual monsoon, then eased, but
worsened again last week.
   By his definition, ``directly affected'' included anyone who had
lost relatives, a home or business, crops or other property.
   ``It is a calamity,'' he said. ``It's like a war situation, and
then you have to reconstruct the country.''
   Rahman said it was too early to put a cost on the damage and
reconstruction, but called the loss ``colossal _ homes,
agriculture, communications, bridges, culverts, educational
institutions, all damaged or washed away.''
   He and the pilots said the helicopter tour covered 4,000 to
5,000 square miles northwest, west and southwest of Dhaka. The
choppers sometimes flew only 200 to 400 feet above the water.
   About 45 miles west of Dhaka at the confluence of the Jamuna and
Ganges, mighty rivers even in non-flooding months, muddy brown
water stretched for up to 25 miles, interrupted only by protruding
treetops.
   Entire villages had vanished. In some towns, people had pitched
tents on the roofs of buildings tall enough to reach above water
level, and taken their goats and chickens to safety with them.
   Floods are an annual monsoon event in Bangladesh, a disaster
that accompanies the blessing of rain for the crops, but Rahman and
other officials said those of 1988 are the worst in memory.
   Last year's floods killed about 300 people, Rahman said, but
Dhaka newspapers put the 1987 toll at 1,500.
   Because the floods come regularly, people seek higher ground or
take to boats as soon as the water starts rising, thus averting
greater loss of life. The government says most who drown are small
children and elderly people.
   Bangladesh, whose per capita annual income of $150, is one of
the world's poorest nations. Rivers run through it like veins,
making it a sort of giant drain pipe for flood waters that pour
south into the Bay of Bengal.
   ``There shouldn't even be a country here. There shouldn't be any
people here,'' a Western relief worker said. Asked whether canals
and dams would help, he shook his head in despair and replied:
``There's too much water.''

<HEAD>Tribune Poll: Press Unfair to Quayle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty-two percent of likely voters in five key
states surveyed for the Chicago Tribune said they felt Dan Quayle
has not been treated fairly by the press, the paper reported Monday.
   But nearly half those polled also said they felt the Indiana
senator tapped by George Bush as a running mate lacks the maturity
and experience to be president.
   The survey was conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates of
Washington for the Chicago Tribune. Hart, who was Walter Mondale's
pollster in 1984, surveyed 1,509 people in Illinois, California,
Florida, New York and Texas in late August.
   Asked for their views on the statement, ``Dan Quayle does not
have the maturity and experience to be vice president,'' 47 percent
agreed, 39 percent disagreed and 14 percent were unsure.
   But 62 percent of those answering agreed that ``the press has
not treated Dan Quayle fairly,'' the Tribune said. Twenty-eight
percent disagreed with that statement.
   The media grilled Quayle after his nomination about whether his
wealthy family pulled strings to get him into the Indiana National
Guard at the height of the Vietnam war.
   Quayle has said he used no influence and is proud of his service
in the National Guard.
   Thirty-nine percent of those polled said they regarded Bush's
choice of Quayle as a ``negative,'' 31 percent said it was
``positive,'' and the rest had no opinion.
   Six percent of those surveyed were Vietnam-era veterans. Among
them, the choice of Quayle was viewed as positive by 22 percent and
negative by 49 percent.
   The poll indicated that Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen was viewed positively by 41 percent of all
respondents, and negatively by 23 percent.
   The margin of error for questions asked all respondents was 3.5
percentage points, and 6 points for the Vietnam-era veterans.

<HEAD>White Law Lecturer Freed After More Than Two Years in Detention</HEAD>

   Raymond Suttner, a law school
lecturer jailed without charge longer than any other white
activist, was freed Monday after more than two years in detention
but was placed under heavy restrictions.
   Suttner, 43, was detained June 12, 1986, the day that President
P.W. Botha declared a nationwide state of emergency that remains in
effect. Suttner spent much of his detention in solitary confinement
and was allowed a half-hour visit from his brother or sister every
two weeks.
   A restriction order issued by Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok places Suttner under nighttime house arrest and bars him from
any educational facility, effectively preventing him from returning
to his job at the University of the Witwatersrand.
   Vlok said Suttner was being released on ``humanitarian grounds''
because his health had deteriorated in recent weeks. The statement
did not elaborate.
   Suttner, wearing blue jeans and a blue sweatshirt, had a tearful
reunion with his sister and his friends at a Johannesburg house
where he will be required to spend each night. Atop his shoulder
was a small lovebird he had been allowed to keep in his cell at
Pretoria Prison.
   Friends said three months ago Suttner was allowed to keep a
bird, but the first died, and the second escaped, even though its
wings had been clipped.
   His restriction order requires him to report twice daily to the
neighborhood police station, forbids him from leaving Johannesburg
and bars him from giving interviews, according to his lawyers.
   They said Suttner also is barred from working with various
anti-apartheid organizations and cannot have more than four
visitors at his house at one time.
   An estimated 30,000 people, virtually all of them black, have
been detained for varying periods during the emergency.
   The government does not issue comprehensive statistics on
detentions. Last week, it said there were 802 detainees still in
custody who had been held longer than 30 days.
   Suttner, a law lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand
in Johannesburg, served eight years in prison starting in 1975 for
aiding the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   In March 1985, he was elected to the Transvaal Province
executive committee of the United Democratic Front, a non-banned
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   In 1986, he co-authored a book about the Freedom Charter, a
blueprint for a non-racial, post-apartheid South Africa that has
been endorsed by the African National Congress and the United
Democratic Front.
   Suttner was detained at Johannesburg's airport as he was about
to fly to Harare, Zimbabwe, to deliver lectures about the Freedom
Charter and popular justice.

   A former official of GTE Corp. has accused the
telecommunications giant of bribery, currency smuggling and
exchanging money on black markets in Central America, according to
court documents.
   A lawsuit filed by Paul DiMatteo, former GTE general manager for
Central America, also claims his supervisors forced him to engage
in illegal financial practices designed to drain capital from
Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.
   He alleges he was fired unfairly by General Telephone &
Electronics, based in Stamford, Conn., when he refused.
   The lawsuit is set for trial Sept. 13 before U.S. District Judge
Earl Gilliam, who last month denied GTE attorney's request that the
case be dismissed.
   GTE officials have declined to discuss the matter but issued a
brief statement denying DiMatteo's allegations.
   According to the statement, the 10-year GTE veteran was fired
for failing to ``perform satisfactorily as a general manager.'' He
was never encouraged to engage in illegal activities during his
three-year term as general manager of the company's electric
products subsidiaries in Central America, it said.
   ``Mr. DiMatteo's suit is totally without merit and we're
confident that GTE will be completely exonerated in this matter,''
the statement said.
   DiMatteo, 57, who now owns a small manufacturing business in
northern San Diego County, denied he was fired for poor
performance. Neither he nor his lawyers would discuss the case
further.
   In court documents, his lawyers have indicated that they intend
to bring up during the trial similar allegations made against GTE
in the past.
   According to the documents, Odalier Villalobos, Costa Rica's
vice minister and later minister of the economy from 1983 through
1986, was involved in the bribery scheme.
   GTE, through the consulting firm Consultoria E. Inversiones
Ltda., paid Villalobos the equivalent of $400 to $500 a month
beginning in 1983 so he would prevent a competitor from selling
products in Costa Rica, DiMatteo said in a deposition.
   Villalobos suggested the payments, and they were approved by
Frederick Howard, DiMatteo's superior in Danvers, Mass.,
headquarters of GTE's precision materials and Sylvania lighting
groups, the lawsuit said.
   Howard, who eventually fired DiMatteo, did not return a
telephone call to his office in Williamsport, Pa., where he is now
vice president and general manager of GTE's electrical components
and materials division.
   Villalobos could not be reached in Costa Rica for comment.
   DiMatteo claims his only interference with the payments was to
set the monthly limit and to insist the consulting company find a
way to make the payments appear legal in the company's books.
   He says he objected, however, when the company sought to
exchange in U.S. dollars instead of local currencies and encouraged
illegal methods if legal ones were unavailable.
   To obtain this objective, DiMatteo says his superiors turned to
the black market, smuggling and other illegal methods, according to
a disposition.
   An audit of GTE by Arthur Andersen & Co. accounting firm in 1983
noted that the company had exchanged in the currency black market
in Nicaragua and warned the company against continuing the
practice, according to court documents.
   In 1977, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that GTE
paid as much as $14 million in bribes and kickbacks in 28
countries, including Iran, the Philippines and the United States.
   GTE neither admitted nor denied the allegations, but consented
to a permanent injunction, agreeing to refrain from any future
violations.

<HEAD>Labor Chief Backs Sub-Minimum Wage For Teen-Agers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said Monday the
big increase in the minimum wage sought by Democrats could cost
jobs and fuel inflation.
   McLaughlin, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, defended
Republican support for a sub-minimum ``training'' wage for
teen-agers.
   ``The minimum wage increase across the board as it's being
discussed by the Democrats in Congress is really a job loser and
potentially inflationary,'' said McLaughlin.
   But in Detroit, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
told a Labor Day rally, ``We're going to raise that minimum wage
and make sure the people of this country have a decent income.''
   The minimum wage has been set at $3.35 an hour since 1981.
Democrats are pushing bills in Congress that would raise it to
$4.55 by 1991 in the Senate version or $5.05 by 1992 in the House
version.
   Vice President George Bush is generally opposed to raising the
$3.35-an-hour minimum wage. His running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, has led the opposition in the Senate to a Democratic bill
that would raise the minimum and peg it to inflation.
   But Quayle said last week that he now favors a gradual increase
in the minimum wage to $4 an hour, coupled with a training wage.
   McLaughlin said she was on the same wavelength as Quayle.
   ``We're sort of talking the same thing. There is an interest in
increasing the minimum wage but there's a greater interest in
having some kind of a training wage,'' she said.
   Merely increasing the minimum wage does not address young
workers' need for better education and training, she said.
   ``I think the idea of some kind of a training wage that might
allow us to get, particularly our young people, into a job, learn
about coming to work, coming back the next day and learning a
little bit about what it takes to hold a job might be helpful,''
she said.
   She questioned the logic of an across-the-board increase when
``there are some places right now that some are suffering from job
shortages and you can't get a job for $7 or $8 an hour and there
are other place in our country you'd love to have a job at $3.35.''

Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than three years after TWA
flight 847 was hijacked to Beirut, two of the U.S. passengers who
were held hostage aboard the plane will tell a German court about
their terrifying ordeal.
   Their testimony will be given at the trial of Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, who is accused of air piracy and murder.
   The trial resumes Tuesday after a four-week recess.
   Thirty-nine U.S. passengers were held captive for 17 days, and a
U.S. Navy diver was killed during the hijacking.
   Some passengers were beaten and many said they were tormented
with death threats after the Athens to Rome flight was commandeered
on June 14, 1985.
   Hamadi, who already admitted in court that he was one of the
four men who took part in the hijacking, is expected to testify
Tuesday before the judges hear from the two U.S. citizens, whose
names have been withheld.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Monday the U.S.
government was flying the two U.S. witnesses to Frankfurt aboard
military aircraft for security reasons.
   ``That's why from tomorrow on, security level No. 1 will be in
force at the Rhein-Main Air base,'' the newspaper said. ``The U.S.
government is having the witnesses brought to the Hamadi trial with
military aircraft.''
   Asked about the Bild report, base spokesman Lt. William
Dillingham told The Associated Press: ``I have not heard anything.''
   Security level No. 1 is the highest possible at a U.S. military
base.
   The pilot of flight 847, John Testrake, already has told the AP
from his home in Missouri that he probably will sleep at the
Rhein-Main base just outside Frankfurt when he comes to Germany
later this month to testify.
   ``They will first testify about the identification of the
suspect,'' court spokesman Falk Thomas said of the two American
witnesses. ``And they'll also testify about the horrible
experiences during the hijacking.''
   The hijackers beat 23-year-old Robert Stethem, a U.S. Navy
diver, before he was fatally shot and his body was thrown onto the
runway at Beirut airport.
   West German officials arrested Hamadi on Jan. 13, 1987 at
Frankfurt airport, when customs inspectors found explosives in his
luggage.
   His trial began July 5 in a specially built courtroom inside
Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison.
   He has testified that the goal of the hijacking was to force the
release of Lebenase Shiite Moslems imprisoned in Israel. Shortly
after the ordeal was over, Israel released about 700 Shiites.
   In a surprise move Aug. 9, Hamadi admitted he had taken part in
the TWA hijacking but denied killing Stethem.
   Under West German law, the Frankfurt court can convict Hamadi of
murder even if he did not pull the trigger. Hamadi, who West German
officials say is 24 years old, faces a maximum sentence of life in
prison.
   U.S. officials also have indicted Hamadi on air piracy and
murder charges, but West Germany has refused an extradition request
from Washington.
   In April, a Duesseldorf court sentenced one of his brothers,
Abbas Hamadi, to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two German
businessmen in Beirut in an unsuccesful bid to force West Germany
to free Mohammed from prison.
   The other three men involved in the TWA hijacking remain at
large.

   A man with a stun gun hanging from his belt was
taken into custody Monday at a campaign rally for Vice President
George Bush, the Secret Service and police said.
   ``Right now it appears there was no danger involved to the vice

San Diego field office of the U.S. Secret Service.
   ``The person did nothing to present a harm to either the vice

   The gun doesn't shoot any type of projectile and must be touched
to a surface to send a charge, Sergek said.
   The weapon was tucked in a pouch hanging from the man's belt
when a Secret Service agent spotted it, said police Sgt. Nate
Caplan.
   ``They're considered non-lethal but if you had a 75-year old
person with a heart condition, it might be different,'' said Caplan.
   The man, whose name was not immediately released, was being
questioned by the Secret Service, Sergek said. The man was by
himself and was not ``anywhere within arm's reach of the vice
president.''
   ``There are indications he has carried the item for
self-protection and merely had it with him when he went to the
rally,'' he said.
   ``It may merely have been a situation of very poor judgment.
There doesn't appear to be any connection between the item and the
visit.''

<HEAD>Four Navy Spy Satellites Said To Soar Aboard Refurbished ICBM</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Titan 2 rocket that
once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into
space Monday, carrying a secret Air Force payload believed to be
four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships.
   The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles
had been used as a space booster, and apparently was the second
time U.S. spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a
week.
   ``It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as
expected,'' said Air Force Capt. Norma Payne.
   But the spokeswoman added that officials would not know for two
to three days whether the classified payload achieved its intended
polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South poles.
   The rocket almost certainly carried a four-satellite addition to
the Navy's White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System, an
electronic eavesdropping system that locates and identifies Soviet
and other ships by detecting radio and radar transmissions, space
policy analyst John Pike said before the launch.
   ``The Navy really likes them,'' said Pike, of the
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. ``They are very
important for being able to keep track of the Soviet fleet.''
   Pike said a White Cloud launch ``consists of one mother
satellite and three subsatellites,'' and that when orbit is
reached, the mother satellite deploys the other three spacecraft so
all four are strung out a few hundred miles from each other in
polar orbit.
   The $37.5 million Titan 2 roared off Space Launch Complex 4 West
and into fog-shrouded skies at 2:25 a.m. PDT, Ms. Payne said at
this sprawling military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The force of the blast-off rattled windows in the nearby town of
Lompoc, where police said they received a half-dozen calls from
residents asking whether it was an earthquake or a launch.
   The liquid-fueled, two-stage rocket is 103 feet high and capable
of lifting 4,200 pounds into a 100-nautical-mile circular orbit.
   Starting in the 1960s, Titan 2 rockets were kept in silos in
Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona, where they served as intercontinental
ballistic missiles, each carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead.
   But the missiles were removed from service ``because the
propellants were corroding the innards of the missile and they had
a tendency to blow up,'' Pike said.
   The Air Force then ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space
boosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Marietta Corp.
Air Force officials have said more are likely to be refurbished
because recycling the old ICBMs is cheaper than building new
rockets.
   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting
Soviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34D
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. But a source close to the project,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the spacecraft failed to
achieve its desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the
upper stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite. He said there was
little hope of salvaging that mission.
   Despite that failure, Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete''
Aldridge issued a prepared statement after Monday's launch,
declaring, ``This is the year of space launch recovery.''
   ``Today's successful Titan 2 launch is the first of three new
boosters the Air Force will launch in the coming year,'' Aldridge
said. ``The Titan 2, Titan 4 and the Delta 2 ... will ensure this
nation's access to space for many years to come.''
   The launch had been expected a week earlier, but apparently was
delayed by a fuel leak that the Air Force said spurred evacuation
of the launch pad Aug. 28. No one was hurt in that incident,
officials said.
   Pike said the only other payload the Titan 2 might boost into
orbit from Vandenberg was a Defense Meteorological Support Program
satellite. But he called that unlikely.
   A Titan 2 exploded in its Arkansas silo on Sept. 19, 1980,
killing one crewman, injuring 21 others, blasting a 250-foot-wide
crater and lofting the nine-megaton warhead harmlessly 200 feet
from the silo. Fuel leaks and vapor spurts that prompted brief silo
evacuations also plagued Titan 2 ICBMs, which since have been
replaced by Minuteman, Midgetman and MX missiles.
   Pike said Air Force officials have testified before Congress
that the first 13 reconditioned Titan 2s would be used for one
launch of a LANDSAT Earth-observing science satellite, six launches
of DMSP weather satellites and six launches of satellites in a
classified program.
   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _
already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace
aging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, he said.
   Pike compared White Clouds to Soviet RORSATs, or Radar Ocean
Reconaissance Satellites, which monitor U.S. ship movements.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American negotiators on Monday broke off
talks with Greek officials about a new agreement on U.S. military
bases after Greece announced it will close the U.S. Air Force
installation at Athens Airport.
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the talks were ``temporarily suspended'' so the negotiating
team, headed by Ambassador Alan Flanagan, can return to Washington
for guidance.
   The spokeswoman said the Greek side ``for the first time stated
their call for the closure of Hellenikon base was non-negotiable.''
   Neither she nor Sotiris Kostopoulos, the Greek government
spokesman, could say when the talks, held at the Foreign Ministry,
would resume.
   The suspension came at the beginning of a ninth round of
negotiations for a new Greek-American defense accord to replace a
1983 agreement that expires in December. The talks began in
November 1987.
   Hellenikon, which is next to Athens International Airport, is
one of four American bases that have operated in Greece since the
1950s. It provides support for U.S. Air Force and Navy planes
monitoring Soviet naval operations in the Mediterranean and for the
three other U.S. bases. The Greek government has not indicated that
it intends to close any of the other bases.
   About 1,400 American servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700
Greeks work at the base, located 10 miles from the city center.
   About 3,500 U.S. military personnel are stationed at the four
U.S. bases, two near Athens and two on the island of Crete.
   As a form of rent for the bases, Greece currently receives $340
million a year in U.S. credits to purchase military equipment.
   The socialist government of Premier Andreas Papandreou was
elected in 1981 on a platform that called for closing all the
American bases and pulling Greece out of NATO. Two years later, he
signed a new bases pact, saying the closures were postponed for its
five-year duration.
   The premier now says Greece is willing to sign another bases
agreement, but that it must first be approved in a referendum.
   Papandreou also insists that the United States help solve
Greek-Turkish disputes over military control of the Aegean Sea and
the divided island of Cyprus in return for a new agreement.
   
   Under the terms of the 1983 pact, Greece issued a formal
shut-down notice for the bases in July, although it is not expected
to be carried out.
   Last month, the government said it was planning to shut down
Hellenikon.
   But Monday's announcement at the talks was the first official
notification to the U.S. government.

<HEAD>No Radiation Leak During Soviet Nuclear Plant Fire, Tass Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear power plant caught fire in Lithuania on
Monday, but automatic safety systems extinguished the flames before
radiation could be released, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said no one was injured by the blaze which began at 12:50
a.m. in a control cable of the second reactor of the Ignalina power
plant in Lithuania, a Soviet republic on the Baltic Sea.
   The chief dispatcher of the Soviet Atomic Power Ministry, Erik
Pozdyshev, told Tass the reactor's safety systems automatically
kicked in and that the fire had already been put out by the time
firefighters arrived.
   He said no radiation escaped the plant, and there were no
injuries among the public or plant employees. The reactor, one of
two at the plant, was shut down after the accident, Tass said.
   The news agency's prompt reporting of the fire reflected the new
official policy under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive
for more openness, especially about important events such as
accidents.
   ``Considering the heightened public interest in nuclear reactor
operations, which is quite understandable after the Chernobyl
accident, we decided to inform the public about what has happened
at the Ignalina station at once,'' Pozdyshev said.
   The Soviet Union waited days before informing the world of the
April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant.
   The first report on the accident came from Swedish officials
after high levels of radiation were discovered in Sweden.
   The world's worst nuclear power accident killed 31 people and
sent out a cloud of radiation that stretched worldwide. It led to a
major re-evaluation of the safety of nuclear power in the Soviet
Union and in many other countries.
   The government newspaper Izvestia reported on Thursday that
Lithuania's Cabinet had ordered construction stopped on a third
reactor at Ignalina.
   The newspaper said numerous safety violations were committed
during construction of the plant's first reactor, and were repeated
on the third unit.
   Tass said a commission has been formed to investigate today's
accident.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan is planning dual
fall campaigns: an overt political one on behalf of George Bush and
the other an effort to wring a wish list of items from an
election-minded Congress.
   ``I'm sure the president's philosophy right now is very much _
`So little time and so much to do,''' said Kenneth Duberstein,
Reagan's chief of staff.
   But Reagan's mix of lambasting Democrats on the political stump
and then seeking cooperation from them on Capitol Hill is not one
that necessarily has produced legislative successes in the past.
   Some items, however, hold more promise than others in the
relatively brief time before Congress adjourns to start campaigning
in October.
   ``If lame duck means he's in his last year in office, then he's
a lame duck, but if it means he can't get anything done, it doesn't
fit,'' contended White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper, in Santa
Barbara with the Reagan entourage.
   Cooper said that among other things, Reagan intends to push for
Senate passage of the U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement and
designation of a Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs.
   With some fanfare, the president also will sign the new housing
bill _ seen as an election-year boost for both parties.
   The president also will look for the near-certain approval of
his two Cabinet nominees, Nicholas Brady as Treasury Secretary and
Lauro Cavazos to head the Department of Education.
   Included on the more contentious side of the ledger are the
renewal of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, welfare reform and
passage of the remaining 11 appropriations bills.
   When he signed an appropriation bill in mid-August, Reagan told
Capitol Hill not to repeat its past habit of sending him ``a single
mega-bill ... that wraps up the various appropriations bills in a
single bill that spends $600 billion of the taxpayers' money.''
   And in his radio address on Saturday, Reagan gave notice he'll
veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him if it does not
contain a work requirement.
   ``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president said
in his Labor Day weekend radio address.
   On his way back from a vacation at his ranch in California,
Reagan planned two stops Tuesday _ the dedication of the Gray
Communications Center at Nebraska's Hastings College and an address
to the American Legion in Louisville, Ky.
   The Hastings stop is viewed as a favor to a long-time
acquaintance _ Washington public relations executive Bob Gray _ who
is a native of the small Midwestern town and worked as the director
of communications for Reagan's 1980 election victory.
   Reagan also is scheduled to appear briefly at a fund-raiser for
Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb., the appointed senator in a tight race
against the popular former Nebraska governor, Bob Kerrey.
   In Louisville, Reagan is expected to extol his administration's
record on defense and foreign policy, and repeat his hardly-veiled
message that the vice president will continue along the path he
started, if elected.
   Duberstein, interviewed Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,''
said it is ``a priority of the president to make sure that George
Bush is elected.''
   ``I think the president can be a help to the vice president by
reminding the American people how far things have come, how many
changes have been made and why it is important to continue on that
path,'' Duberstein said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has told reporters
Reagan is expected to travel twice a week on Bush's behalf,
visiting between eight to 15 cities in the next two months.
   ``The main thing will be to draw the distinction between
liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans,'' Fitzwater
said of Reagan's political agenda.
   ``He'll talk about peace through strength, why a strong military
forced the Soviets to the bargaining table and resulted in arms
control agreements of unprecedented proportions _ and contrast that
with the Democratic opposition's military stance of reduction in
strength, pulling troops out of various places around the world.
   ``These will be his themes and we thing they'll play in all
parts of the country,'' Fitzwater predicted.
   The president has no foreign trips planned, but is likely to go
to the United Nations for the opening of the fall General Assembly
session.

<HEAD>Town Lawyer Killed in Fireworks Display Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAYVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion during a fireworks display
killed a civic-minded lawyer, tragically ending a Labor Day weekend
celebration in his hometown, officials said Monday.
   Scott F. Broster, 28, who returned to practice law in the
southern Illinois town of 2,300 people about a year ago, was
helping set off the fireworks when the accident happened Sunday
night, said Mayor Jack Hagedorn.
   ``I don't know of anybody that didn't like Scott,'' Hagedorn
said in a telephone interview Monday. ``He was a fine young
attorney. He was a very fine young man. He had excellent character
and everything. It's just a tragedy.''
   Hagedorn said Broster had recently worked as a part-time city
attorney, handling all legal work for the town since it doesn't
have a full-time city attorney.
   Grayville police and the state fire marshal's office were
investigating the cause of the explosion, said a police dispatcher.
   She said the accident happened at 8:19 p.m. Sunday while Broster
was ``assisting with the annual fireworks display'' in a city park.
   He was flown by helicopter to Welborn Baptist Hospital in
Evansville, Ind., where he was dead on arrival at 9:45 p.m., said a
nursing supervisor.
   Several thousand people had gathered Sunday night to watch the
fireworks display, which was the finale to the annual Grayville
Days Celebration. The events, which started Friday, included a
parade, the ``Miss Grayville'' and ``Little Miss Grayville'' beauty
contests, and carnival attractions.
   ``Everything was just going swell,'' he said. ``This kind of put
a black cloud over it.''
   The display had been going on five or 10 minutes when the
explosion occurred, the mayor said. The fireworks were being set
off from mortars, each manned by someone loading, someone firing
and someone cleaning, he said.
   ``I think his job was the cleaning,'' Hagedorn said.
   Bernita Campbell, a secretary at Sturm Funeral Home, which was
making arrangements for the lawyer's funeral, said the victim's
parents, Sam and Juanita Broster, were among the crowd watching the
fireworks.
   She said Broster was single and was active in the Lion's Club
and Jaycees.
   ``He was just a nice guy, that's all,'' Mrs. Campbell said.
``It's devastating, really. In a small town where you know
everybody, it's very bad.''

   Vandals slashed seats at the Cineplex Odeon
Showcase Theater and spray-painted threats against a studio
executive early Monday in an apparent protest of the film ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' police said.
   The vandals caused an estimated $5,000 in damage to the Showcase
Theater. The theater isn't showing the film but it is part of the
Cineplex Odeon chain, which is showing the movie in Century City.
   The painted threats were aimed at Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA
Inc., parent company of Universal Studios, which produced the film.
   One message written below the screen said: ``Lew Wasserman: If
you release `The Last Temptation of Christ,' we will wait years and
decimate all Universal property. This message is for your insurance
company.''
   The movie has angered fundamentalist Christians because it
depicts a Christ who doubts his divinity and is susceptible to
human temptation.

   Students threatened on Monday to launch
further strikes and mass protests unless an interim government is
formed to supervise multiparty elections that would end 26 years of
one-party rule.
   In another development, at least 20 people were killed in a
Rangoon suburb in a clash between neighborhood security patrols and
thieves.
   The Students Action Supervision Committee told reporters the
government must meet their demands by 8 p.m. Wednesday or protests
will follow Thursday.
   Opponents of the Burma Socialist Program Party have rejected
President Maung Maung's proposed nationwide referendum on the
future of his party.
   For the past weeks, the government has been crippled by strikes
and daily demonstrations, and a Western diplomat estimated that 40
town administrations were taken over by protesters. Neighborhood
committees, formed largely of students and Buddhist monks, have
patrolled many areas of the country against the spreading
lawlessness and violence.
   On Sunday, residents of the Rangoon suburb of South Okkalapa
said a bloody clash occurred after thieves captured 15 members of a
neighborhood committee who rushed to a government biscuit factory
to stop looting.
   On Monday, a mob burst into the factory, where they found eight
members of the committee dead, including two monks. The mob then
killed 12 thieves, captured 10 and set fire to nearby houses
belonging to people suspected of involvement in the looting, the
residents said. The thieves reportedly included people recently
released from jail.
   More than 10,000 prisoners have been released or escaped from
Burma jails over the past two weeks in what some diplomats
speculate was a calculated move by the government to create chaos
to justify a military crackdown.
   The All Burma Students Union on Monday released what it said was
a secret Aug. 22 directive from the head of government military
intelligence.
   ``Under prevailing conditions in the country, intelligence units
and their informers must use various methods to cause fear and
confusion among the public,'' the directive said. It bore a
signature and official stamp, but its authenticity could not be
verified.
   A Japanese Burma scholar, Minoru Kiryu, said on Monday the
situation in the country was ``chaotic'' and it was uncertain if
Maung Maung's government would survive until the party meeting.
   Also Monday, more than 50,000 people held a solemn ceremony on a
lake in suburban Rangoon for student protesters said to have been
killed, assaulted and drowned there by police during March 17
anti-government demonstrations.
   Wreaths were placed on a flower-decked raft which drifted away
as many students wept and prayed aloud.
   The government said at least 43 people died in the March riots,
but Western diplomats said at least 100 people were killed.
   Demonstrations flared in June and again after ruler Ne Win
resigned July 23 after 26 years in power. The party chose
hard-liner Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   Government radio said 112 people died in Rangoon in rioting
against Sein Lwin, who resigned after only 17 days in power.
Diplomats believe many more people were killed.
   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19 as the first civilian leader in
26 years.

<HEAD>Solidarity: More Strikes Will Occur Unless Talks Produce Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity activists said on Monday that
more strikes will occur in Poland if negotiations with the
government on workers' grievances do not achieve a positive result.
   At a news conference for Western correspondents at the apartment
of senior Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron, representatives of miners
and steel workers on strike last week said that they were pinning
their hopes on winning legalization of the banned Solidarity union
on the upcoming talks.
   ``It is certain'' more strikes will occur if the talks fail,
said Kuron.
   ``Workers problems will not be settled without Solidarity,''
said Jan Litynski, a Solidarity activist from Warsaw who was with
striking miners in recent weeks in Jastrzebie.
   Kuron said there has been no word yet from the authorities about
when the talks would be convened and exactly who would participate.
   He said Solidarity was prepared to propose its delegation to the
talks, but gave no details. There were indications that the talks
first proposed by Interior Minister Czeslaw kiszczak might not take
place until next week.
   ``There is no rush really. Preparation is a must,'' journalist
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, an adviser to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
said in a telephone interview over the weekend.
   Litynski said the workers who went on strike between Aug. 16 and
Saturday were fighting for an independent trade union, and were not
interested in transforming Solidarity into a political club, as has
been mentioned by some commentators in the official media.
   Poland's worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 martial law
crackdown on Solidarity ended Saturday, when remaining strikers
left an occupied mine in Jastrzebie in southern Poland and the port
and main bus depot in the Baltic port city of Szczecin.
   Walesa had pressed the strikers to quickly settle local
grievances and end the strikes so talks about the future of
Solidarity could begin within the framework of the round table
talks offered by Kiszczak.
   Meanwhile, Solidarity spokesman Wojciech Mazierski said 200
transit workers demanding higher pay went on strike Monday in the
small city of Zdunska Wola in central Poland, 120 miles southwest
of Warsaw.

<TEXT>
   Secret Service agents Monday arrested a man
they said was carrying an electric stun gun during a campaign
appearance by Vice President George Bush, a Bush spokeswoman said.
   The unidentified man, who allegedly had a so-called Tazer gun
strapped onto the outside of his camera bag, was being held by San
Diego police, said spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   The incident happened as Bush was shaking hands with a Labor Day
crowd after he gave a speech to a group of employees of a
fish-processing plant on the San Diego waterfront.
   The man was arrested ``after being spotted by one of the
agents,'' Ms. Tate said. ``He is now in custody.''
   Steve Sergek, the special agent in charge of the San Diego field
office of the U.S. Secret Service, said later, however, that while
the unidentified 31-year-old man had ``exercised very poor
judgment,'' the man was being released.
   ``Right now it appears there was no danger involved to the vice
president,'' Sergek said. ``The person did nothing to present a
harm to either the vice president or anyone else there.''
   Ms. Tate had said the gun was ``potentially lethal.''
   ``The vice president's reaction was, `what a great job the
agents did,''' she said.
   She said the vice president was informed of the arrest aboard
Air Force Two en route to his next campaign event in Los Angeles.
   She said further details were sketchy. She said that another
man, and possibly a third, may have been initially held, as well,
but were released.
   She said the man was arrested along a ropeline separating the
secure area where the vice president was and the public area.

<HEAD>Opening Statements Set for Tuesday in Sailor's Court-Martial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opening statements are set Tuesday for
the court-martial of a Navy rescue-swimmer instructor charged in
the drowning of a trainee.
   A five-officer panel will hear the case of Petty Officer Michael
W. Combe, 28, of Tempe, Ariz. He is charged with involuntary
manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery in the March
2 death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.
   His trial has been delayed a full week by extended pretrial
motions in his case and the court-martial of his former boss, Lt.
Thomas A. Torchia, 32, of Princeton, Ill.
   A four-member court-martial last week found Torchia, former
officer in charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School, innocent of
dereliction of duty in Mirecki's death.
   Much of the prosecution testimony in Combe's trial is expected
to mirror that in Torchia's case.
   In the earlier court-martial, a pathologist testified that
Mirecki, who had a phobia about being dragged under water, drowned
in a swimming pool at Pensacola Naval Air Station after suffering a
fear-induced heart attack.
   Combe is accused of holding his head under after instructors
threw the panic-striken victim back into the pool when he climbed
out and tried to exercise his right to drop out of the voluntary
training, witnesses testified.
   Torchia, who was on the telephone in his office overlooking the
pool, blamed the instructors for exceeding their authority and
using bad judgment. He testified that if he had been present
Mirecki would still be alive, but he saw and heard nothing to alert
him the recruit was in danger.
   The prosecution and defense each plan to call as many as 30
witnesses in Combe's case, expected to take at least through the
end of the week.
   Listed as defense witnesses are four instructors already
punished for forcing Mirecki back into the pool. None of them had
testified in Torchia's trial.
   Neither Torchia nor his former boss, now-retired Navy Capt. C.L.
Lavinder, who received a reprimand for dereliction of duty, are
listed as potential witnesses by the defense or the prosecution.

<HEAD>Worst Of Drought Is Over For Mississippi River, But Problems
Linger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shipping companies, the Coast Guard and the
Army Corps of Engineers are joining in an unprecedented effort to
ensure that the drought-caused bottlenecks that idled Mississippi
River traffic this summer won't recur, a shipping industry
executive says.
   The three groups are forming a task force and establishing a
clearinghouse at Cincinnait to share information about the
Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, according to Jeffrey Smith, vice
president of a shipping industry group called American Waterway
Operators.
   The drought, Smith said, has cost the industry an estimated $200
million, about 20 percent of its annual operating revenue.
   However, the worst of the 1988 drought may be past for those who
work on or live along the river, some officials believe.
   An underwater dike built by the Corps, for example, has stopped
saltwater from creeping up the Mississippi and fouling the water
supply for New Orleans. However, the Corps has had to supply by
barge some downriver communities with millions of gallons of fresh
water.
   At New Orleans, the river is running at a rate of about 130,000
cubic feet per second _ about 55 percent of normal for this time of
year. In early July, however, it was closer to 114,000.
   ``We're still way below average,'' said Roger Steakely, a Corps
spokesman in Vicksburg, Miss. ``But we're not nearly as bad as we
were.''
   Gulf of Mexico waters have pushed their way up the
drought-reduced river, turning the muddy, brown water a beautiful
blue-green and threatening the water supply for New Orleans, which
is about 100 miles from the mouth of the Mississippi.
   Because the salty water is heavier than the fresh Mississippi
water, the Corps decided to impede the flow by building a dirt dam
15 to 25 feet high across the river bottom.
   The $790,000 structure, about 30 miles south of New Orleans,
succeeded in heading off the salty flow. It was too late, however,
for some small communities in Plaquemines Parish, where the Corps
continues to deliver barge-loads of water from farther upriver.
   By the middle of last week, the Corps had barged 52 million
gallons for those communities, according to Bruce Sossaman, a
spokesman for the New Orleans office of the Corps.
   The increased flow on the Mississippi also means a reduction in
the number of bottlenecks that idled traffic upriver in June. Last
week, the Coast Guard relaxed restrictions on towboat loads that
had been imposed earlier this summer because of low water levels on
the lower Mississippi.
   The task of the clearinghouse on river conditions is to ensure
that everyone on the river is informed of current developments,
Smith said.
   ``It's a matter of the industry and the Coast Guard and the
Corps working smarter,'' said Smith. ``They took all the
communications that were disparate and decentralized, and
centralized them out of one office on the Ohio River.''
   As for how long the drought will affect the rivers, the experts
aren't sure.
   ``Based on what the weather service has said, there's virtually
no way we're going to get back to normal ... We've been hearing
we're in for drought conditions on the river through the remainder
of the summer,'' said Sossaman.
   The amount of rain needed to bring the river back up to its
average flow rate may not come around until next spring, Steakely
said. And that's all right with him.
   A sudden heavy flow of water down the Mississippi would dump
more sand and sediment down river and could cause as many problems
with navigation as it would solve, Steakely said.
   Slow, steady improvement is better, he said. ``We really aren't
hoping for a dramatic change quickly.''

   Twisted Sister and Motley Crue may not
know it, but their music is keeping ducks and geese alive in
western Montana.
   The migrating waterfowl hate the heavy-metal rock music by the
groups so much that they avoid a pond contaminated by cyanide where
the music is kept playing on loudspeakers 24 hours a day.
   The contaminated pond is at the Golden Sunlight Mine near
Whitehall, where cyanide is used to leach gold from ore. The
cyanide flows into a 250-acre settling pond, where it is poisonous
to waterfowl.
   Don Jenkins, the mine's administrative superintendent, read how
rock music was used to scare starlings from a New York airport. He
decided to try Twisted Sister, Motley Crue, Scorpions and others.
   He also uses propane-powered cannons that fire every couple of
minutes, and security guards who occasionally fire shotgun blasts
or flare guns. Colored helium balloons bob up and down.
   But, says Jenkins, ``the rock music is still the best ploy we've
got.''

   All the trustees of a private elementary school
wanted was a new gymnasium, a library and room for more offices.
   What Trinity School got was more like a castle.
   ``Kindergothic'' is the word coined by architects Terry Sargent
and Larry Lord to describe an architectural style that combines a
crystal-studded rock wall and turret rising from a ravine. The
front entrance is sheltered by skewed columns of stacked stone
cubes.
   ``It's architecture for children without being ridiculous,''
Sargent said. ``We used details in an informal way so children
could look at it and actually learn something about architecture.''
   Passersby are startled but children are delighted.
   ``There's a whimsical quality about the new structures that at
first rocks the adult back a little bit, but the children ... see
it as they might imagine a castle would be like ... (filled with)
all kinds of strange windows and beautifully colored objects,''
said Chuck Johnston, headmaster at Trinity throughout the project.

   Kurdish guerrillas claimed Monday they
killed or wounded 7,000 Iraqi soldiers who they said attacked their
mountain strongholds in northern Iraq with chemical weapons.
   The guerrillas also said 1,900 civilians died and some bases
were lost.
   Iraq denied the claims.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi authorities displayed thousands of Iranian
weapons they said were captured in offensives before a cease-fire
took effect Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old war with Iran.
   Also on Monday:
   _Iran accused Iraq of violating the cease-fire by bombing
villages in northwestern Iran with fighter-bombers. Iraq denied it.
   _The head of the U.N. observers, Gen. Slovko Jovic, said after a
visit to the southern front that ``there are some minor problems
that we are trying to resolve. Many of the problems we have been
able to solve.'' He did not detail the problems. He spoke in an
Iranian TV interview, monitored in Nicosia.
   _U.S. officials abruptly postponed for at least five days the
scheduled pullout of the missile cruiser Vincennes from the Persian
Gulf region after at least one Arab government raised last-minute
objections, U.S. military sources said. The vessel was to have
ended its patrol duties with the U.S. Joint Task Force Middle East
on Sunday and was earlier reported to actually have left.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the change
of orders for the Vincennes was based on ``diplomatic rather than
military'' considerations, and ``came from a much higher level''
than the Navy in the gulf. He said a previously announced Pentagon
decision not to replace the cruiser still stood.
   _In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the foreign ministers of the Arab gulf
states urged the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council to help push along the peace talks between Iraq and Iran
that began Aug. 25 in Geneva.
   The five permanent members are the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France.
   U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson spent more than two hours Monday in
Geneva with Iranian officials, seeking a solution to the deadlock
in negotiations on an end to the war, which has cost up to 1
million lives and hundreds of billions of dollars.
   There was no word of progress on the 12th day of the
negotiations. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has
been serving as mediator, but left Geneva on Thursday for other
business and chose Eliasson to continue the work.
   Iraqi newspapers accused Iran of stalling the talks and Sadoun
Hamadi, a high Foreign Ministry official, left for the United
States. The official news agency said he would meet with Secretary
of State George P. Shultz.
   According to the Kurdish guerrillas, most of the civilians were
killed in 65 villages they say have been attacked with chemicals.
   ``Most of the Kurdish civilian casualties are from constant
Iraqi poison gas attacks on their villages and settlements,'' a
spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Party told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi news agency said Iraq ``strongly denied
fabricated allegations reported by The Associated Press on the use
of chemical weapons in north Iraq.''
   It quoted a commentator, not identified, as saying: ``These
figures are only present in the figments of imagination of those
who wove them'' and declared:
   ``All that happened in the north of Iraq was that a group of
traitors of Iran's agents collapsed and those of them who fled
abroad could not find but lies to cover up their defeat.''
   The agency said President Saddam Hussein's government was
preparing to ``sue newspapers involved in publishing false reports
on alleged use of chemical weapons in the north of Iraq.''
   Iran said Monday that 5,000 Iraqi Kurds fleeing chemical attacks
had arrived on its territory.
   A dispatch from the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashami as saying 2,000 of the Kurds
had arrived via Turkey. It quoted Mohtashami as condemning the
United Nations, human rights groups and the media for not speaking
out.
   An estimated 70,000 to 90,000 Iraq Kurds fled to Turkey in the
past week, but Turkish officials said Monday the influx had stopped
because Iraqi soldiers had blocked mountain passes leading to the
border.
   Turkey's foreign minister, Mesut Yilmaz, told reporters: ``The
way Iraqi forces are deployed, actual crossing has become
impossible.''
   In Syria, an enemy of Iraq and Iran's ally in the war, the
official news agency said President Hafez Assad met with Jalal
Talbani, a Kurdish guerrilla leader. No details were given.
   Iraq displayed hundreds of captured Iranian tanks and artillery
pieces to underline its claim that Iran suffered devastating losses
in battles just before the truce began.
   Brig. Muthanna Nasiri stood before an array of weaponry that
stretched in deep ranks for more than a mile on the outskirts of
Baghdad.

<HEAD>Renegade Buffalo Corraled In Roundup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve of 14 renegade buffalo were rounded up on a
south Florida range _ bordering Interstate 75 and Florida's
Turnpike _ by latter-day trailhands on all-terrain motorcycles.
   The two bison still at large, a female calf and a bull, are the
last of 250 that escaped in March from a livestock ranch near Miami
when horse rustlers cut through a fence, said Dr. Arnold Oper,
their owner.
   The roundup didn't come off without incident. A 30-year-old
television reporter, Albert ``Bud'' Fraga, tumbled seven feet onto
his head from a swamp buggy, and was reported in serious condition
Monday with a broken sternum and two cracked vertebrae.
   The roundup of the buffalo, also known as bison, began at dawn
Sunday in 240 acres of marsh and pasture land near the border of
Dade and Broward counties.
   Oper, 64, risked jail for himself and confiscation of his
animals if he did not round up the renegades this weekend,
according to officials with the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission. He had made several efforts to capture the animals.
   Since the breakout, the 800- to 900-pound animals have
frightened golfers at the Hollywood Lakes Country Club in Pembroke
Pines and startled motorists on I-75 and Florida's Turnpike.
   On Aug. 16, a Florida Highway Patrol dispatcher hit one of the
buffalo while driving on the interstate, killing the animal and
demolishing her car.
   About 35 volunteers on seven all-terrain motorcycles and four
swamp buggies drove the buffalo herd west through scrub myrtle and
Florida holly and into a camouflaged pen where they were coaxed
back into a cattle trailer for a trip back to the livestock ranch.

<TEXT>
   Rain was scattered over the South and sections of the Northeast
on Monday but most of the rest of the nation had sunshine for Labor
Day.
   Rain and scattered thunderstorms extended across central and
southern Florida and along coastal sections of Georgia and the
Carolinas.
   Many locations in northern Florida received around an inch of
rain during the morning. Heavier rainfall during the six hours up
to 2 p.m. EDT included 1.51 inches at Gainesville, Fla.
   Jacksonville, Fla., had gotten over 5 inches already this month
and more rain was expected Tuesday.
   By contrast, the drought in the northern Rockies has meant 13
months in a row of below-normal precipitation at Havre, Mont.,
which has not seen any measurable rain for 61 days. That is the
longest such dry period in 110 years of record keeping.
   Showers were widely scattered across the Northeast, especially
over western Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and eastern Ohio.
   Mild temperatures in the 60s, 70s and 80s prevailed across most
of the eastern half of the nation.
   Temperatures at lower elevations of the Rockies were mostly in
the 80s, and readings in the Pacific Northwest were generally in
the 60s and 70s.
   But hot weather continued over California and the desert
Southwest. Temperatures soared to over 100 by midday in sections of
the Los Angeles area. San Diego broke its record for this date of
91 degrees before noon, its third consecutive day of records.
   In the Southeast, Miami tied its record of 93 degrees.
   In the Pacific, hurricane Uleki continued to move away from
Hawaii and was no longer a significant threat to the island state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Marquette, Mich., and Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 106 at
Redding and the Alameda Naval Air Station, Calif. Sunday morning's
low was 31 degrees at Gunnison and Estes Park, Colo., and Havre,
Mont.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
along a stationary front from eastern sections of the Carolinas to
northern and central Florida. Widely scattered showers were
forecast over northern New England and northeastern New York.
   Highs only in the 60s were predicted over New England, the upper
Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes region; mostly in the 70s or 80s
over the rest of the eastern half of the nation; mostly in the 80s
and 90s across the western half of the nation, but holding in the
70s in the Pacific Northwest and along the northern California
coast; and above 100 in the desert Southwest and interior valleys
of California.

<HEAD>Soviet Marshal Says US Seeks Military Superiority at Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military chief of staff said Monday the
United States has begun an arms race at sea that increases the risk
of war, and refuses to negotiate a reduction in naval forces.
   ``U.S. naval forces are a key instrument of pressure, helping to
conduct (the) U.S. positions of strength policy,'' Marshal Sergei
F. Akhromeyev wrote in a lengthy article in the Communist Party
daily Pravda.
   The article, which included Soviet statistics comparing the
superpower naval forces, appeared at a time when Western observers
say they have detected a scaling back of Soviet navy activities.
   Akhromeyev, who toured U.S. naval facilities during a visit to
the United States this summer, accused the United States and some
of its NATO allies of starting ``an arms race at sea.''
   ``They have enormous power,'' he wrote. ``The U.S. Navy
comprises 15 attack aircraft carriers, of which five are
nuclear-powered.''
   The main thrust of Akhromeyev's article was that U.S. naval
forces are designed for offensive strikes while Soviet warships are
intended to defend their country's coastline and cannot be
considered a military threat.
   As examples of the U.S. Navy's ability to deal powerful
offensive blows, Akhromeyev cited U.S. actions against Libya,
Lebanon and Grenada.
   ``In the Persian Gulf area, the United States and its allies
have amassed an armada of over 60 combatant ships, of which over
half are American,'' the Soviet chief of staff wrote.
   ``This dangerous demonstration of naval might is explained
ostensibly by the eagerness to ensure the freedom of shipping in
the Persian Gulf. The true objective is to shore up the presence of
the U.S. naval fleet on a permanent basis there.''
   He accused the United States of opposing negotiations on
reduction of naval forces or any agreement curbing their activity.
   Akhromeyev said Soviet-led Warsaw Pact countries ``do everything
depending on them to turn the world ocean from a zone of war danger
into a zone of peace and cooperation. We call upon the United
States and its NATO allies to support us in this undertaking.''

   Utility crews worked Monday to complete repairs
to the last of six electricity cables damaged in a fire that
blacked out 50 blocks of downtown Seattle for nearly four days.
   Workers had restored power by Sunday evening to the entire area
with the exception of one building _ a parking garage with some
office space _ near the underground vault where the fire began.
   In addition, said Seattle City Light spokesman Scott Forslund,
electricity had not been turned back on in a few buildings whose
owners weren't available or chose to wait, Forslund said.
   The sixth and final 13,000-volt cable gives the system redundant
capacity, in case of extra-heavy demand or the need to turn off
power in one of the other cables to make repairs, said Scott
Forslund, Seattle City Light spokesman.
   About half the affected customers had begun getting power when
the switch was thrown on four feeder cables Saturday evening, and
other customers were hooked up overnight before the fifth cable was
repaired Sunday evening.
   As power was restored, fire crews roamed the area to ensure that
no fires broke out in equipment on which power switches were on
when the outage began.
   City Light officials had no estimate of costs to restore power
or repair damage, City Light spokesman Hugh McIntosh said.
   The cause of the fire that sparked Seattle's biggest-ever power
outage Wednesday remained unknown, but officials said an aluminum,
direct-current supply cable for overhead electrical trolley bus
lines was a key factor in the blackout's severity.
   City Light assistant superintendent Jerry Garman said Monday
that the fire ``undoubtedly'' started in low-voltage City Light
cables, which run from transformers to feed individual buildings.
   As the system heated, power to the high-voltage feeder cables
should have been cut by ``current limiters.'' But the Metro transit
cable melted, and molten aluminum cut the high-voltage cables
before power could be cut to all but two of them.
   ``Once the DC (Metro cable) started to go ... it took what would
have been a minor inconvenience and turned it into a major event,''
Garman said.
   ``It's like we had eight or nine welding torches going at the
same time.''
   What caused the low-voltage cables to catch fire in the first
place won't be known until data is analyzed, Garman said, adding he
could not predict how long that would take.
   In the meantime, City Light crews will check other locations
with similar dual arrangements of City Light and Metro cables to
try to head off other problems, Garman said.
   ``I'm sure we're going to be looking at ways of protecting us
from them and them from us,'' he said.
   Some customers in the blacked-out area already have filed
monetary claims against the city, claiming losses as the result of
the failure, Forslund said.
   During the height of the blackout, city officials estimated that
90 percent of all businesses were closed in the area, which
included an estimated 130 restaurants, 55 shops in the popular Pike
Place Market, the Bon Marche department store, the 875-room Westin
Hotel, and uncounted other hotels, grocery stores and taverns.

<HEAD>Peace Talks to Resume Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-mediated peace talks
among South Africa, Angola and Cuba will reconvene Wednesday in
Brazzaville, Congo, the Department of Foreign Affairs announced.
   It said in a statement Monday that the talks were expected to
focus on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Marxist-ruled Angola.
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said Saturday that Cuba has
increased its troop strength in Angola from 50,000 military
personnel to 60,000.
   Angola, Cuba and white-dominated South Africa signed a
cease-fire pact on Aug. 8 that links withdrawal of South African
and Cuban troops from Angola and independence for South-West
Africa, also called Namibia.
   South Africa said on Aug. 30 that it had withdrawn the last of
its forces from Angola, leaving rebels of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to fight alone against the
Cubans and government troops.
   UNITA was not included in the peace talks and Savimbi has said
his guerrillas will continue to fight for a power-sharing coalition
with the Marxists.
   Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975 and UNITA lost a
civil war to the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola. UNITA then began a guerrilla campaign and
Cuba sent troops to help the government.
   Namibia, lying between South Africa and Angola, has been
administered by South Africa since World War I under a mandate by
the defunct League of Nations.
   South Africa has rejected demands by the United Nations that
Namibia be given its independence. A major South African condition
has been withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola.
   South Africa has said it will withdraw from Namibia by Nov. 1
and allow elections by next June if the Cubans leave Angola.
   UNITA said in a statement distributed in Lisbon, Portugal, that
the rebels had rejected U.S. efforts to persuade them to accept a
period of three years for the removal of the Cuban troops.
   It said the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, Chester Crocker, tried to persuade the rebels at a meeting
Aug. 27 at an undisclosed location in Africa to accept a phased
Cuban pullout over a three-year period.
   Savimbi said Saturday at the rebels' headquarters at Jamba in
southern Angola that he supported U.S. efforts to resolve the
13-year-old conflict but complained that Crocker was ``giving all
the cards'' to the Angolan government.
   ``The Cubans do not want to leave Angola, and Crocker knows
that,'' said Savimbi, ``We will continue to fight until the country
is truly free.''
   ``There are now 60,000 Cubans in Angola and they are prepared to
launch attacks within days. The Cubans didn't comer here to wave
goodbye. It is an initiative for an offensive.''
   In Angola, Deputy Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura said Angola
would make concessions at the Brazzaville talks to facilitate the
negotiations but it would not jeopardize its sovereignty and
independence. He did not elaborate on possible concessions,
according to the report by the Angolan news agency ANGOP that was
monitored in Lisbon.
   It said he appealed to UNITA to ``listen to the voice of
reason'' and accept the government proposal that the guerrillas lay
down their weapons and be integrated into society without
recrimination.

<HEAD>Israelis Break Up Draft-Dodger Ring; 16 Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Monday arrested two
lieutenant colonels and 14 other soldiers and civilians in raids on
a group that took bribes to help Israelis avoid military service,
Israel radio reported.
   An army statement said authorities began an investigation after
receiving a tip that young people were avoiding active-duty and
reserve service ``in exchange for gratuities and monetary gifts.''
   Such an investigation is rare in Israel, which has a tradition
of a ``citizen army.'' All Israeli Jews are required to serve in
the military _ men for three years and women for two _ and men
remain in the reserves until age 57.
   The army statement gave no indication of how widespread the
scheme was, but Israel television quoted military sources as saying
it may have helped as many as several hundred Israelis avoid
regular and reserve military service.
   Israel television called the scandal unprecedented and said more
arrests were expected.
   The radio report said among the eight soldiers arrested were a
woman and two lieutenant colonels and all were connected to the
recruiting office. It did not identify them.
   The radio and television accounts said the civilians included
several doctors and that ``large sums'' of money were involved, but
did not elaborate.
   Brig. Gen. Emil Elimelech, head of military police, told Israel
television the scheme involved ``false medical documents and
tampering with computers, entering and removing data.''
   Disclosure of the draft-dodging came during the Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied
after the 1967 Middle East war.
   Palestinians have been battling Iraeli rule in the territories
since Dec. 8. The government has responded by sending thousands of
troops into the areas and at least 258 Palestinians and four
Israelis have been killed in the uprising.
   Refusal to serve in the Israeli military is rare but some
soldiers have rejected particular postings. At least 37 soldiers
are in jail for refusing to serve in the occupied territories,
according to Yesh Gvul, an organization of conscientious objectors.
   Elimelech said it was ``absolutely impossible'' to link the
draft-dodging scheme to the uprising.
   Israel radio said the the suspects are to appear for arraignment
Tuesday before a civil judge in Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv.

<HEAD>Diplomats Believe Airport Attack Produced Heavy Casualties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A guerrilla rocket attack on Kabul
airport last week may have claimed far more casualties than
reported by official Soviet and Afghan news media, Western
diplomats said Monday.
   The sources, quoting dispatches from Kabul on condition of
anonymity, said two aircraft were confirmed destroyed in the attack
Thursday and 12 helicopters were unaccounted for.
   Moscow's official news agency Tass put casualties at nine dead
and 21 wounded, but the sources said that appeared low.
   ``Western diplomatic observers believe that casualties and
damage to the military areas north of the airport are much higher
than are currently being claimed by Tass,'' one said, but none of
the sources said they had reliable figures.
   Last Thursday the same sources said rebel-fired rockets slammed
into the airport and parts of the capital for more than an hour,
causing ``massive damage'' and igniting an ammunition dump.
   Western diplomats reported seeing one An-12 transport plane on
fire, an unidentified aircraft destroyed and two hangars burned to
the ground.
   They said a helicopter park near the ammunition depot was
largely empty and only 11 military helicopters were observed,
``leaving at least a dozen helicopters unaccounted for.''
   Whether the helicopters had been destroyed or evacuated was not
clear.
   Guerrillas also rocketed the airport Aug. 27, reportedly
destroying one military transport, damaging runways and killing
four people.
   Insurgents have made daring attacks on Kabul in recent weeks as
Soviet troops withdrew, reaching the numerical halfway point on
Aug. 15.
   On Sunday, the guerrillas claimed Soviet forces backed by Afghan
troops had redeployed in the besieged southeastern city of Kandahar.
   Soviet officials said the last Red Army troops left the city
Aug. 7 and Western sources said they could not confirm reports that
any had returned.
   A report from the Associated Press of Pakistan agency said eight
Afghan warplanes bombed a Pakistani village early Monday, killing
one person and wounding eight.
   It identified the bombed village as Bogay in the Dir
administrative district, 140 miles northwest of Islamabad near the
Afghan border.
   Afghan warplanes earlier were reported to have bombed Pakistani
territory last Thursday, killing one villager and wounding seven at
Shabqadar.
   The Islamabad and Kabul governments have had strained relations
since Soviet troops arrived in Afghanistan in 1979 support the
pro-Moscow government. Kabul and Moscow accuse Pakistan and the
United States of aiding the guerrillas.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief designer of a Soviet cargo plane said
Monday that engine flooding caused the aborted takeoff of the huge
aircraft at the Farnborough Air Show, Europe's leading aviation
event.
   Konstantine Lechakov told a news conference at the Soviet
Embassy a new engine for the Antonov 124, the world's heaviest
plane, would be sent from the Soviet Union but was delayed awaiting
overflight permission from West Germany.
   The blue-and-white aircraft remained grounded at Farnborough, 35
miles southwest of London. Its takeoff was aborted Sunday, the
opening day of the show.
   It was supposed to give display flights daily during the
week-long show, at which the Soviets also are showing their most
advanced fighters, two MiG-29s.
   At the embassy news conference members of the Soviet delegation
praised the MiGs and were complimentary about rival Western combat
aircraft on display, but dodged questions about Soviet production
figures and sales targets.
   The delegation includes aviation officials, aircraft designers
and a test pilot.
   ``There was an engine surge. The reason for this engine surge
was the air bleed system,'' Lechakov said through an embassy
interpreter. Aides who were questioned later said that meant engine
flooding, or excessive fuel.
   A tongue of flames 20 feet long shot from one jet engine as the
aircraft moved down the runway and the pilot shut down the three
other engines of the 400-ton plane.
   Farnborough organizers have stressed safety after the Aug. 28
air show disaster at Ramstein, West Germany, where 52 people were
killed and more than 300 injured when three Italian stunt flying
aircraft collided and one crashed into the crowd.
   Viktor A. Maksimovsky, deputy aviation minister, was asked why
Moscow had decided to show the MiG-29 in the West and he said it
was evidence of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or more openness.
   ``The participation of the Soviet Union this year at Farnborough
is proof of it,'' he declared.
   Test pilot Valery Menitsky, who flew a MiG-29 in precision
manuevers Sunday, praised the Western fighters on display,
including the American F-18 and F-16 and the Mirage 2000 from
France.
   ``But to be perfectly frank, I like our plane much better,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Actor Who Played ``Goldfinger'' Dead At 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German actor Gert Froebe, a gifted
comic who became famous as the gold-craving criminal in the 1964
James Bond film ``Goldfinger,'' died of a heart attack Monday. He
was 75.
   Froebe was born Karl-Gerhard Froebe on Feb. 25, 1913, in Planitz
in what is now East Germany. He was a natural-born comic, described
by critics as Germany's version of American Danny Kaye.
   Froebe played in nearly 100 films, including roles in the 1961
U.S. production ``The Longest Day,'' and the British-produced ``The
Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines,'' filmed in 1964.
   But he was best known internationally for his role as the greedy
villain ``Goldfinger'' who battled Sean Connery's James Bond in the
film version of the Ian Fleming thriller.
   In 1965, Froebe made headlines when he was quoted by the British
newspaper Daily Mail, as saying: ``Naturally I was a Nazi'' during
the Third Reich.
   Froebe denied making the comment and insisted: ``What I told an
English reporter during an interview ... was that during the Third
Reich I had the luck to be able to help two Jewish people, although
I was a member of the (Nazi) party.''
   Despite Froebe's denial, Israel banned all of his films for
months until a Jewish man, Mario Blumenau, informed the Israeli
Embassy in Vienna that Froebe hid Blumenau and his mother from the
Nazis.
   In a statement issued Monday, Froebe's agent Pal Berkovicsa said
the stocky actor died of a heart attack at 1 a.m. in a Munich
hospital, where he underwent an operation after suffering a heart
attack a week ago.
   Froebe studied theater under Dresden actor Erich Ponto and Paul
Guenther in Berlin during the early years of Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich.
   After theaters were closed by the Nazis in September 1944,
Froebe was called into the German army, where he served until the
end of World War II.
   In his first major role in a film, ``Berlin Ballads,'' which
opened in European cinemas in 1948, film critics wrote: ``Germany
has a new Danny Kaye.''
   Froebe is survived by his fifth wife, Karin. He has two sons by
previous marriages, Utz and Andreas.

   The widow and brother of Palau President Lazarus
E. Salii handled a revolver within minutes after Salii was found
shot to death and before the weapon was turned over to national
police, a government spokesman said.
   The .357-caliber Magnum revolver from which one shot had been
fired was given to police at a hospital by Salii's brother, Carlos,
said spokesman Bonifacio Basilius.
   ``There was hysteria and panic,'' Basilius said. ``They were in
shock. They were not involved in the shooting.''
   The 51-year-old president was the second elected Palau chief
executive to die by violent means in three years.
   Salii was elected in August 1985 to succeed Haruo I. Remeliik,
who was assassinated two months earlier. Three Palau men convicted
at trial in connection with Remeliik's death later were acquitted.
   The Palau government has yet to make public results of an
autopsy performed on Salii 55 hours after his Aug. 20 death at his
home in Koror, the Western Pacific island chain's capital.
   Palau is a 400-mile-long archipelago about 600 miles east of the
Philippines and 4,500 miles southwest of Hawaii. Its nearly 15,000
residents inhabit eight of its 200 islands in a U.N. trusteeship
administered by the United States.
   Salii was a staunch proponent of a proposed compact of free
association that would terminate the trusteeship and make Palau
self-governing.
   The U.S. government is awaiting results of an FBI ballistics
test on the revolver and the spent cartridge, Basilius said in a
telephone interview.
   The tests at the FBI laboratory in Washington might show if
Salii's fingerprints were on the weapon, Basilius said.
   ``We want to know for sure, we want to eliminate any doubt as to
whether there were any other person's fingerprints on the gun,'' he
said. ``We want to be absolutely certain that the bullet came from
that gun.''
   Meanwhile, The Associated Press obtained a copy of an Aug. 24
letter from a high-ranking traditional chief, Ibedul Yutaka M.
Gibbons, in which he addresses the question of whether Salii killed
himself.
   In the letter to Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, whose
agency is responsible for Palauan affairs, Gibbons wrote that new
President Thomas Remengesau told him the night of Salii's death
that it was a suicide. Gibbons said Remengesau told him Salii
``himself did it at his house.''
   Gibbons said, ``Since the forensic evidence was not finalized by
then, it seems inconceivable that he (Remengesau) would then voice
such an irresponsible conclusion.''
   Gibbons asked Hodel for an investigation into the deaths of
Salii and Remeliik.
   Remengesau was sworn in as president to fill out Salii's
remaining term which ends this year. He was elected vice president
at the special election in which Salii was elected president.
Remengesau also was minister of justice under the two slain
presidents.
   Remengesau is expected to seek the presidency in Palau's Nov. 2
general election.

   Jerry Lewis, vowing to tug at the hearts of
viewers, used a parade of celebrities and emotional appeals from
victims Monday to raise a record $41,132,113 in his 23rd annual
Labor Day telethon to fight muscular dystrophy.
   The 21{-hour event also featured appearances by corporate
sponsors who contributed $34,379,537 not included in the telethon's
final tote.
   This year's figure exceeded by about $2.1 million the previous
record of $39,021,723 set last year.
   ``The success of the show is a tribute to the warmth and
generosity of the American people, who go further each year in
supporting MDA's fight against muscle diseases,'' Lewis said
following the show.
   Because of the longevity and the money raised up to this year _
$443,182,370 _ the annual Labor Day event has become known as
``the'' telethon.
   Lewis, in opening the annual event Sunday evening, promised
``there is light at the end of the tunnel'' in the long battle
against 40 neuromuscular diseases targeted by the New York-based
Muscular Dystrophy Association.
   He estimated that 120 million people in the United States and
Canada would view the opening and closing hours of the telethon.
   Lewis, who has long referred to young muscular dystrophy victims
as ``my kids,'' told viewers the telethon was ``for your kids, who
I never want to be my kids.''
   The telethon featured news on progress the past year in the
battle against the crippling diseases that touch 1 million American
families.
   Ann-Margret and her husband, Roger Smith, said the organization
was making strides in unlocking the mystery of the various muscle
diseases.
   Smith suffers from myasthenia gravis, a sometimes fatal muscle
disease that is among the 40 covered by the MDA. He said he had ``a
stake in the outcome'' of the MDA battle.
   Ann-Margret called telethon viewers ``part of the answer'' and
Smith added ``without you, it won't happen.''
   The show featured a segment on singer-comedian Dennis Day, who
died in June of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known
as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS is one of the neuromuscular
diseases targeted by the MDA.
   Two of Day's 10 children were featured with their father as he
talked of his hope of beating the disease.
   ``I could see it in his eyes,'' said son Tom McNulty. ``He was
afraid. I was afraid too, afraid of losing him.''
   Ed Frye, an actor in the soap opera ``Another World,'' talked of
his mother's slow death from ALS.
   ``It must have been terrifying for her to feel that trapped,''
Frye said of the disease that cripples the body but not the mind.
   The telethon also featured some of the victims of muscular
dystrophy who are waiting for a cure.
   Susan Duyser of Grand Rapids, Mich., wept as she talked about
her husband, Ward, a pharmacist crippled by muscular dystrophy.
   ``We have an 18-month-old baby and I'd like to have her dad see
her grow up,'' she said. ``I'm afraid he won't be there.''
   ``Our family needs a miracle, and I know you can do it,'' she
told Lewis and the telethon audience.
   The Labor Day event, which Lewis started on a single New York
City station in 1966, is now carried by more than 200 stations.
   Ed McMahon, the telethon's long-time anchorman, was back, along
with co-hosts Sammy Davis Jr., Casey Kasem, Tony Orlando, Norm
Crosby and Julius LaRosa.
   Celebrities featured during the event included Ray Charles, Liza
Minnelli, Engelbert Humperdinck, Brian Wilson, Maureen McGovern,
Jack Jones, Frank Sinatra, Robert Wagner, Jack Lemmon, Sugar Ray
Leonard, Kool and the Gang, Charlie Callas, Chuck Mangione, Al
Hirt, Rip Taylor, Pia Zadora, the Pointer Sisters, Harvey Korman,
Charo and the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.

   Workers plugged the last of the 36
wells on the Piper Alpha oil platform and divers now can search for
bodies still missing in the world's worst oil rig disaster, the
operating company said Monday.
   Crews operating from the support vessel Tharos installed the
final cement plug Sunday, Occidental Petroleum said in a statement.
   ``The plugging of the last well on Piper Alpha represents the
successful conclusion of a key stage in the operation to secure the
platform before divers can search the seabed,'' John Brading,
Occidental's chief executive in Britain, said in the statement.
   Brading did not indicate when divers would try to recover the
bodies of workers killed when the platform, about 120 miles off the
Scottish coast, exploded in flames July 6.
   The disaster claimed 167 lives. A police spokesman said Monday
120 bodies remained missing and most were believed to be in the
platform's living quarters, now submerged.
   About 500 feet of the rig's pre-explosion height of 649 feet is
now under water.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker made an 11th-hour
plea to supporters Monday for help in raising a $3 million down
payment in his bid to return to the ministry he left amid a
sex-and-money scandal.
   ``I'm not going to leave any stone unturned,'' Bakker said in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``I'm not going to
stumble now.''
   Bakker said friends and acquaintances have so far contributed
close to $2 million in cash and letters of credit toward the $3
million he needs by Tuesday.
   He said a group of people is working on raising the remaining $1
million in thousand-dollar pledges and he has set up a trust
account at a Hendersonville, N.C., bank to accept donations. Those
donations would be used only if he and his wife, Tammy Faye,
succeed in purchasing the ministry, he said.
   Bakker said he has raised the money and pledges by word-of-mouth.
   ``We are sort of running our own Labor Day telethon without a
television station,'' he said.
   PTL Bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton asked for the money
as a sign of Bakker's ability to follow through on the $165 million
offer he's made for the Heritage USA Christian theme park, a
satellite network and undeveloped property near the Fort Mill
ministry.
   Bakker so far leads the bidding for buying assets of the
ministry that went into bankruptcy soon after he left PTL in March
1987.
   But Benton said Friday he was ``very, very skeptical'' Bakker
could come up with the $3 million letter of credit by Tuesday.
Calls to Benton's Winston-Salem, N.C., home Monday went unanswered.
   After Tuesday, Benton said he would consider other offers to
purchase the ministry's assets. U.S. Bankrupty Judge Rufus Reynolds
has instructed Benton to recommend a buyer by Saturday.
   Bakker attorney Jim Toms said Bakker expects to have the whole
$3 million by Tuesday. But he said he plans to ask Benton to accept
$1 million in cash and a $500,000 letter of credit, so that the
remaining funds could be used to pay immediate operating expenses.
   Bakker said a Midwest bank has agreed to handle the funds from
unidentified Greek investors he says are backing his offer to buy
PTL. He also said he has several other banks are willing to aid his
bid, but he would not identify the banks.
   ``We're almost there,'' Bakker said.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen blasted Republicans George Bush and Dan Quayle Monday
as an uncaring duo willing to maintain a legacy of poverty for many
Americans.
   ``In the America of George Bush and Dan Quayle, the rich get
richer and the poor get poorer,'' Bentsen told a fiercely
Democratic Labor Day rally at a rodeo arena in this East Texas oil
city.
   ``And the vast majority of our people work harder and longer
just to stay even. They need two incomes just to keep from slipping
back,'' the senator argued.
   Bentsen began his fall campaign in his native Texas, saying he
wanted to be more aggressive. He hopes to help the Democratic
ticket bring home the Lone Star state's 29 electoral votes, now
within the reach of either party.
   A poll published Monday in the Dallas Morning News showed the
Republican ticket leading 47 percent to 44 percent, within a 3
percentage point margin of error.
   Bentsen told reporters traveling with him that he expected to
take Texas and win the national election, but he acknowledged that
the Democrats were revising their tactics. ``I think you'll see a
more aggressive campaign,'' he said.
   ``You can't keep taking the kind of attacks that we saw,'' such
as Bush's claim that Dukakis was unpatriotic because he vetoed a
bill mandating the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in the
public schools of Massachusetts, he said. On that issue, Bentsen
added, Republicans would suffer a voter backlash.
   The Texas senator, returning to the trail after a brief vacation
in Wyoming, said he had spoken by telephone with John Sasso, the
Dukakis campaign's new vice chairman who was returning a year after
resigning for what some considered an unfair attack on Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., a Dukakis rival at the time.
   Bentsen began his Labor Day at a small business center in Waco,
a central Texas area struggling economically. He met with local
people trying to launch new businesses and, afterward, told about
250 supporters that Bush, who also claims Texas as his home, had
done little for the state.
   ``They've sort of turned their backs on us, this administration
has,'' Bentsen said, standing in shirtsleeves outside the former
high school building.
   The Republicans ``have an oil man who's running for president,''
he said, ``but, frankly, I can't remember anything he's done for
the energy industry in the past eight years.''
   At the Beaumont rally, attended by some 2,000 people, Bentsen
said that Quayle was ``on the wrong side of every energy issue
important to Texas _ and still George Bush chose him'' as his
running mate.
   Bentsen said that Quayle exemplified the Republican attitude
with his record opposing health care for pregnant women,
immunizations for children and the bill requiring 60 days advance
notice for workers facing plant layoffs.
   ``When it comes to basic issues important to working men and
women, the Republicans say, `No,''' he said.
   Bentsen said the Republicans were trying to make ideology and
patriotism the issues of the campaign, but, selling Dukakis to
Texans, he said the real issues were jobs and opportunity.
   ``The Republicans like to wrap themselves in the flag, and
demagogue on phony issues,'' said Bentsen, standing before a huge
American flag flanked by the Texas flags.
   ``The Republicans like to talk about left and right. But this
election is not about moving left or right,'' he said. ``It is
about standing still with George Bush or moving forward with Mike
Dukakis.''
   Bentsen ridiculed Bush's statement that the Republicans would
create 30 million new jobs, noting there are only about 6 million
people officially categorized as unemployed.
   ``I understand George Bush is out at Disneyland today. I think
he's out there talking to his economist,'' Bentsen said.
   Texas state Sen. Carl Parker, who hosted the Beaumont rally,
said he understood Bush's plan. The Republicans, he said, want
people to have ``such sorry jobs, we're going to have to work two
of 'em.''
   From Beaumont, Bentsen traveled to St. Louis, where he
introduced Dukakis at a Labor Day picnic.
   Bentsen's two-day trip was to continue the job-creation theme on
Tuesday with visits to a training center in Lawrenceville, Ga.,
outside of Atlanta, and a trip to Virginia Polytechnic Institute in
Blacksburg, Va., before returning to Washington for the night.

   Israel on Monday accused Mohammed Jamal, a top
Moslem religious leader, of urging worshipers to attack Jews at an
archaeological site in Jerusalem.
   There were these other developments:
   _The Supreme Court ruled that Israel can continue blocking
international telephone lines to the occupied territories.
   _Journalists at state-owned Israel radio announced they would
refuse assignments in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip after
management rejected a request for reinforced cars and extra pay to
work there. Since the start of the uprising last Dec. 8 by
Palestinians in the occupied lands, cars carrying press signs
frequently have been stoned. The attacks followed rumors that
Israel's Shin Bet security agents used press credentials as a cover.
   _The army issued orders prohibiting troops from firing tear gas
into enclosed spaces. The new policy resulted from a report last
May by five Israeli physicians who determined that using tear gas
in enclosed spaces was dangerous to human life.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, has
said at least seven Palestinians have perished because of the
improper use of tear gas. The United Nations puts the number of
deaths caused by tear gas at 13 since the uprising began.
   At least 258 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in
clashes and attacks since Dec. 8.
   _Israeli troops closed down the West Bank's largest Palestinian
institution, the 1,000-member A Najah University Friendship
Institute in Nablus, for allegedly conducting illegal high school
classes.
   Saed Kenaan, the head of the institute, said, ``Obviously the
army wants our people to remain uneducated. What we were doing is
not a crime. We were teaching our children instead of leaving them
to the streets.''
   The army has closed elementary, junior high and high schools in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip contending they are used to provoke
anti-Israeli protests.
   _Israel radio said security forces arrested four Palestinians
from the West Bank, including two journalists. It identified the
journalists as Hassan el Khatib who worked for Al Fajr and Salah
Zouheikeh of Al Shaab. Al Fajr and Al Shaab are pro-Palestine
Liberation Organization newspapers published in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Police accused Mohammed Jamal, deputy head of Jerusalem's
Supreme Moslem Council, with broadcasting a call to worshipers to
fight Jews working on an archaeological dig near two of the city's
mosques, police spokesman Rafi Levy said. He said police plan to
indict Jamal on a charge of inciting violence.
   Jamal would be the highest-ranking Moslem official to be tried
by Israel since it captured Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``What I did is not incitement. It is the right of Moslems to
come to their holy place and defend it,'' said Jamal in an
interview. ``They crucified Jesus. Now they want to do the same to
me.''
   On July 3, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at
hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians enraged by the dig near
Temple Mount, which houses two of Islam's holiest shrines, the Al
Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques.
   Through loudspeakers at the site, Moslem officials _ including
Jamal _ urged Palestinians praying at the site to defend the
shrines, saying Israel planned to dig a tunnel to the temple.
   Israeli officials denied they were doing that and said the
purpose of the dig was to open an underground staircase along the
Western Wall, which is Judaism's holiest site and borders the
Temple Mount.
   Israeli officials acknowledged they did not coordinate the dig
with the Supreme Moslem Council, and excavations were suspended
temporarily.
   The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the West Bank human
rights group, Law in the Service of Man, that Israel restore
international telephone and telex lines to the Israeli-occupied
lands. The lines were cut March 18.
   The army argued at the time that the step was necessary because
the uprising was being directed and financed from abroad.
   The human rights group argued that the order violated freedom of
speech and constituted collective punishment.
   ``This is another form of harassment of Palestinians,'' said
Marty Rosenbluth, a member of Law in the Service of Man, the West
Bank affiliate of the Geneva-based International Commission of
Jurists.

   A man carrying what police thought was a
bomb containing dynamite was arrested Monday shortly before a
campaign appearance by GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle,
officials said.
   The Secret Service said the device, which looked like several
sticks of dynamite wrapped in duct tape, turned out to be fake.
   ``It was made up to look like a bomb. It would have fooled me
and anybody else,'' said Jim Huse, special agent in charge of the
Secret Service field office in Detroit.
   A 38-year-old Hamtramck man was arrested on charges of
interfering with a Secret Service agent and was held at the Secret
Service office pending arraignment later Monday, Huse said. He said
he didn't know the man's reasons for having the device.
   ``We hesitate to speculate until an investigation is complete,''
Huse said.
   Because of the incident, Quayle's departure for Hamtramck from
the Detroit City Airport was delayed and he missed a scheduled walk
in Hamtramck's Polish Day Parade, Huse said.
   Instead, Quayle gave a five-minute speech at the reviewing stand
before leaving.
   The man was seen at a bar near the parade reviewing stand by
someone who saw what looked like a bomb and reported it to police.
The Detroit Police Department's bomb squad removed the device,
which was contained in a paper bag, and determined it was a fake,
Huse said.
   Another man was taken into custody but was released after police
determined he knew nothing of the incident, Huse said.
   Quayle campaign officials referred on questions regarding the
incident to the Secret Service.

<HEAD>Textile Workers, Teachers Strike for Higher Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 striking textile workers
demonstrated outside Parliament on Monday for higher pay and new
factory management.
   In Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, officials made their
harshest criticism to date of ``Albanian nationalists'' living in
the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, the official news agency
Tanjug reported.
   The texile workers, most of them women, were from the Sloga mill
in Zrenjanin, 40 miles north of Belgrade, which was shut down by a
strike last Wednesday. After assembling outside Parliament they
were directed to the nearby Trade Union Building, where they met
with Social Affairs Minister Janko Obocki.
   ``We are not asking for color TV sets, all we want is bread .. .
for our children,'' worker Snezana Tosko said, according to a
Tanjug report.
   Strikers demanded a doubling of monthly pay, which now averages
$72, and replacement of the plant management.
   Obocki promised the government would find a way to curb
inflation, now running at an annual rate of 190 percent, and
increase real earnings, Tanjug said.
   Teacher strikes prevented the new school year from beginning in
many parts of the country, newspapers reported Monday.
   Nearly 14,000 elementary school students in Mostar, central
Yugoslavia, returned home after finding classrooms locked because
of a walkout by 500 teachers demanding ``significant improvements
of their monthly wages,'' the daily Vecernje Novosti said.
   Other teachers' strikes were reported at Doboj, 125 miles west
of Belgrade, Tanjug said, and in the northern port of Rijeka and
several other Croatian towns.
   About 850 strikes have taken place in Yugoslavia over the past
eight months, according to government figures.
   Officials claim no alternative exists to the austerity program
imposed in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund if
Yugoslavia is to repay its $21 billion foreign debt and revive its
faltering economy.
   Tanjug said Serbia's president, Petar Gracanin, demanded that
more soldiers be sent to restive Kosovo, where 90 percent of the
people are ethnic Albanians, to counter what he called ``terror
unprecedented in postwar Yugoslavia.''
   His speech followed weekend rallies by more than 100,000 people
in four Serbian towns, protesting alleged intimidation by ethnic
Albanians.
   Gracanin, who holds the rank of general in the Yugoslav army,
complained of ``impossible conditions for life and work'' of ethnic
Serbians and Montenegrins in Kosovo, Tanjug said.
   Riots by ethnic Albanians broke out in Kosovo in 1981 and troops
were sent to stop them.

   President Alfredo Stroessner
reportedly has undergone prostate surgery and was hospitalized, but
the government on Monday refused comment.
   Juan Jose Benitez Rickmann, subsecretary for information and
worship, acknowleged that the 75-year-old Stroessner recently
received a medical checkup in preparation for his trip next month
to Taiwan. He said the general was in good health.
   But Benitez Rickmann did not respond to a question by a reporter
from Radio Caritas who asked about reports that Stroessner had
undergone surgery for a prostate problem and is a patient at the
National Institute for Social Health.
   Stroessner is the longest-ruling chief executive in the Western
Hemisphere. He came to power in a coup in 1954, was elected
president that year and has been re-elected more than a half dozen
times.

   Sen. Dan Quayle, in an unabashedly patriotic
kickoff to the fall campaign, stood Monday at the Statue of Liberty
and declared that he and George Bush ``proudly and unapologetically
embrace the values embodied in the Pledge of Allegiance.''
   ``To us, they are not hokey or cornball or passe,'' said the
Republican vice presidential nominee, who attacked Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis for vetoing a bill to penalize
Massachusetts teachers who refuse to lead students in the pledge.
   The speech at the base of the statue was disrupted briefly by a
small band of demonstrators who held signs reading ``Where was
George?'' and chanted, ``40,000 dead from AIDS. Where was Dan?''
   The Republicans have used the pledge as a rallying point in the
campaign. Quayle said ``the center of our debate is not the
question of anyone's patriotism or love of country.'' But, he said:
   ``The people of America want to know the kind of values that
underscore our beliefs, and George Bush and I proudly and
unapologetically embrace the values embodied in the Pledge of
Allegiance.''
   In vetoing the pledge bill in 1977, Dukakis cited an advisory
opinion by Massachusett's highest court that it was
unconstitutional, as well as a 1943 Supreme Court decision that
students could not be forced to recite the pledge and salute the
flag.
   But Quayle said that Dukakis ``hides behind an advisory judicial
opinion which has no force of law.''
   The ``mindset that would impede the daily recitation of the
Pledge of Allegiance is ... the same mindset that could well
sterilize public education of its proper role as a transmitter of
the values and standards upon which we must rely _ and which have
been central throughout our history,'' Quayle said.
   About 30 protesters from the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power
(ACTUP), a gay rights group, tried to drown out Quayle's speech.
They were immediately surrounded by hundreds of Bush-Quayle
supporters, who began a counter-chant: ``We want Quayle!''
   The group said it was protesting Quayle's vote last year against
a $30 million appropriation for federal funding of AZT, an
experimental drug used in treating victims of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. Quayle's aides said later that he had voted to
kill an amendment to the 1987 supplemental appropriations bill to
provide AZT free to AIDS patients. But they said he did so on
procedural grounds because he did not think such an amendment
belonged on an appropriations measure.
   They said that Quayle had voted this year for an appropriations
measure that provides $1.2 billion for AIDS research, treatment,
prevention and education, and had ``an exemplary'' voting record on
AIDS.
   As the demonstrators were hustled away, Quayle told the cheering
audience, ``I believe in freedom of speech. They have a right to
freedom of speech, but so do I.''
   The Indiana senator chose Liberty Island, where the statue
stands in New York Harbor, for his Labor Day kickoff to the fall
campaign.
   He also toured neighboring Ellis Island, where millions of
immigrants entered the country and which is now undergoing
restoration. Quayle, his wife Marilyn and three children posed for
photographs with a group of people dressed in costumes of their
native countries, and then rode by boat to Liberty Island.
   It was in the nearby Liberty State Park in New Jersey that
candidate Ronald Reagan kicked off his fall campaign for the
presidency on Labor Day 1980.
   Dukakis circled Liberty Island Saturday and paid a nostalgic
visit to Ellis Island with his 85-year-old mother, Euterpe, who
passed through its processing center 75 years ago as a child
emigrating from Greece.
   Quayle arrived in Detroit too late to participate in a Polish
American Day parade in the enclave of Hamtramck. But he addressed
those who had gathered for the parade, telling them that ``We will
never give up until there's freedom again in Poland.''
   Quayle, who wore a button with the name of the Polish labor
union Solidarity, got only a tepid reception from the group, many
of whom booed the candidate and heckled him as he spoke.
   The Secret Service said that shortly before Quayle's arrival, a
man was arrested near the parade reviewing stand when he was seen
carrying what appeared to be a bomb containing sticks of dynamite.
The device turned out to be a fake.
   The 38-year-old Hamtramck man was arrested on charges of
interfering with a Secret Service agent and was held at the
service's office, said Jim Huse, special agent in charge of the
Secret Service field office in Detroit.

<HEAD>Gandhi Assassin Files New Appeal To Avoid Gallows</HEAD>

   A Sikh policeman convicted in the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked the Supreme
Court on Monday to reconsider his death sentence.
   Satwant Singh, who faces death by hanging, also asked for a new
trial in the petition he filed with the nation's highest court,
United News of India reported.
   The court on Aug. 3 rejected an earlier appeal of Satwant
Singh's conviction by a lower court. But prisoners who have been
condemned to death are entitled to a final review by the same
judges.
   Kehar Singh, a Sikh government official found guilty of
conspiracy in the assassination, also was sentenced to the gallows
and filed a similiar review petition on Aug. 30.
   If the review petitions are rejected by the high court, the
condemned men can make a final appeal to President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman.
   Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated at her home on Oct. 31, 1984, by
two of her Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh,
apparently in revenge for an army raid she ordered four months
earlier to put down the Sikh revolt in the northern state of Punjab.
   Beant Singh was killed and Satwant Singh injured in a shoot-out
with other security men minutes after the prime minister's slaying.
   Police sub-inspector Balbir Singh, a guard at the prime
minister's residence, had also been convicted and sentenced to
death by lower courts but the conviction was overturned by the
Supreme Court on Aug. 30.
   The defendants are not related. Singh, which means lion in the
Punjabi language, is part of every Sikh male's name by doctrine of
the faith.
   Mrs. Gandhi had ordered the storming of Sikhism's main temple,
the Golden Temple in Amritsar, to clear the shrine of militants
Sikhs campaigning for an independent homeland in the Punjab.
   More than 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the army
action.
   Sikhs comprise 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are
in majority in Punjab. More than 1,800 people have died in Punjab
this year in violence blamed on Sikh extremists.

<HEAD>Archbishop Denounces Police Response to Bomb Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu
criticized police Monday for suggesting that a bomb blast at the
headquarters of several anti-apartheid groups was caused by
explosives stored in the building.
   Police officials made the suggestion last week following the
Aug. 31 explosion that wrecked Khotso House, a six-story office
building in Johannesburg used by the South African Council of
Churches and several human rights groups.
   Police said investigators had been unable to get through the
rubble to the section of an underground garage where the bomb was
believed to have been placed.
   But they suggested explosives were being stored in the building
for use elsewhere. Building occupants said they believe the bombers
were right-wing extremists or even security force members.
   ``The police have implied that those who work in Khotso House
are perpetrators of violence,'' said Tutu, leader of the Anglican
church in southern Africa.
   ``It is an absolutely disgraceful suggestion to make, and it is
made worse by the fact the police have made it without a tittle of
evidence and before doing any proper investigation,'' Tutu said in
a statement.
   ``We are still waiting to hear the government's clear
condemnation of the bombing.''
   He said the bombing should be viewed in the context of a claim
by military commanders last week that the army was beyond the
jurisdiction of the courts because South Africa was in a state of
war.
   On Sunday, Tutu deliberately defied a government ban on calls
for voting boycotts, urging blacks and whites to stay away from the
polls in next month's nationwide municipal elections.
   State-of-emergency regulations provide for a jail sentence of up
to 10 years for promoting election boycotts.
   A Law and Order Ministry spokesman, Brig. Leon Mellet, said the
text of Tutu's speech would be studied. He declined to comment on
possible action against the black archbishop, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1984.
   Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will hold
separate elections Oct. 26 to choose local officials.
   Many anti-apartheid activists oppose black participation in any
local or regional elections as long as blacks are excluded from
national elections.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote in national
affairs, although the 26 million blacks make up about 75 percent of
South Africa's population.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Longtime watchers of the Miss America
Pageant may notice a few changes during Saturday's contest,
including ``swimsuit strolls'' and an ``improved'' final crowning
moment.
   Bill Caligari, the production manager for the Miss America
Pageant, has been testing new ideas in local contests in the past
year.
   Other changes will be a deeper set on the stage and a Y-shaped
runway ``that will give us more flexibility in production
numbers,'' Caligari said during a rehearsal break last week.
   But a more daring innovation is in the swimsuit competition, he
said.
   ``Instead of standing in front of the judges and `ankling up,'
as we called it, we're going to have the girls do a `walking turn'
and not stop at all,'' Caligari said. ``We're de-emphasizing that
`inspection' image that it had for so long.''
   The changes in this year's pageant, scheduled to be televised
nationally by NBC, came largely from ``brainstorming'' sessions
held in the past year after the appointment of the pageant's new
executive director, Leonard Horn.
   Caligari recalled that Horn almost immediately came in and
listed all the things he didn't like about the pageant production
in years past.
   ``It's exciting _ there's a lot of change,'' Caligari said.
``We're going back to the days when the top contestants were asked
questions on stage _ and these won't be `airhead' questions.''
   Horn said the questions ``will be intelligent questions. We're
not going to be testing them on current events, but they won't be
silly questions either.''
   The final moments of the competition will also be different than
in recent years, Caligari said. Traditionally, the fourth, third,
second and first runners-up were announced, and then the new Miss
America was announced from the remaining six contestants.
   This year, the fourth, third and second runners-up will be
announced, and then, to heighten the drama, the remaining six
contestants will be narrowed down to two. The first runner-up will
then be announced, leaving the new Miss America, Caligari said.
   ``The interplay between the two young ladies promises to be
good,'' he said. ``We've tested this in some of the states and it's
worked well.''
   The pageant production will also have one fewer song-and-dance
number, Caligari said.
   ``The show is supposed to focus on 51 young, talented ladies, so
we're including them in all the production numbers,'' he said.
   The time saved from dropping that number will allow the producer
to include brief video spots of the top 10 finalists' interviews
before the judges, Caligari said.
   ``I got the idea to include parts of the contestants' interviews
from the Winter Olympics, when we saw some backstage interviews
before the athlete went out on the ice or snow,'' he said.
   The ``Miss America Moments'' that used to come before each
commercial break _ which simply told viewers what part of the
contest was next _ will be replaced with short spots on what former
state winners are now doing, Caligari said.
   Some of those women include a town mayor, an assistant district
attorney, a Broadway understudy and an aeronautical engineer, he
said.

   Sandinista troops are being mobilized
in Jinotega province that borders Honduras, the Nicaraguan rebels'
clandestine Radio Liberation said Monday.
   A Defense Ministry source contacted by The Associated Press said
he had no information about any such mobilization.
   Radio Liberation, in a broadcast monitored here, said, ``A
strong and suspicious mobilization of Sandinista army troops ... to
the interior of that province (Jinotega in northern Nicaragua) was
denounced by campesino families.''
   ``The Sandinistas are sending more patrols to those places,
taking advantage of the fact that the rebels forces have retreated
to the border zones with Honduras,'' it said.
   It is estimated that some 9,000 rebel fighters have returned to
base camps on the Honduran side of the border and about 2,000 are
still operating in Nicaragua.
   The rebels, known as Contras, began returning to their camps in
Honduras in April after Nicaragua's Sandinista government and
Contra leaders agreed to a temporary cease-fire and negotiations
for a permanent truce. The peace talks broke down in June.
   In Honduras the Contras are given U.S.-supplied food and
non-lethal assistance.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega said last week Contras who had
left Nicaragua were concentrated near the border.
   He said Sandinista army units are maintaining ``a normal
defense'' along the frontier and claimed they were constantly
harassed by Contras and Honduran troops seeking to provoke a border
conflict.
   Sandinista forces have frequently made sweeps through Jinotega
to dislodge Contras and drive them out of the province.

   Police arrested two men Monday
and seized parts for homemade machine guns apparently for use by
Protestant extremists.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
gun parts were seized in a search of farmland and buildings near
Ballynahinch, 15 miles south of Belfast.
   He said, ``the material would appear to be for homemade machine
guns for a Loyalist (Protestant) organization.''

   A British passenger jet swerved to avoid colliding
with an Airbus freight plane over the English Channel, Civil
Aviation Authority spokesman Simon Lubin reported Monday.
   He said an Air U.K. Ltd. Boeing 737 jet passed within 1{ miles
horizontally of the Airbus Super Guppy freight plane near Paignton,
southern England, at 12:48 p.m. Sunday. He said the freight plane
was French-registered but he did not know which airline owned it.
   Lubin said both planes were traveling at 20,000 feet, with the
British jet bound from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to the island of
Jersey in the channel, and the French plane bound from Toulouse,
France, to Liverpool, England.
   Air U.K. spokesmen were not immediately available for comment
but the domestic news agency Press Association said the Air U.K.
jet carried 130 passengers. The number of crew aboard either plane
was not reported.
   Lubin said the Joint Airmiss Working Group _ made up of the
Civil Aviation Authority, the British Airline Pilots Association
and the Air Traffic Controllers' Union _ will investigate.

<TEXT>
   Most of the 22 investigators seeking the
cause of the Delta Air Lines crash that killed 13 people last week
returned to Washington, but several stayed behind to retrieve more
pieces of wreckage.
   Some of the investigators hoped to question the plane's captain,
but Kathy Matney, Parkland Hospital vice president, said on Monday
Capt. Larry Davis was to undergo surgery this week and an interview
was not scheduled.
   The National Transportation Safety Board team members hope that
Davis can answer lingering questions about Flight 1141, which
crashed and burned within seconds of takeoff Wednesday at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   Ninety-five people aboard the plane bound for Salt Lake City
survived, inlcuding the three members of the cockpit crew.
   At the airport, huge mechanical jaws chewed through the left
wing of the Boeing 727 jet and a bulldozer hauled it away.
   ``Right now it's wreckage work, preparatory to the NTSB's
releasing it to Delta,'' said Joe Dealey, spokesman for the airport.
   NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said he was unsure when the fuselage
would be removed and where it would go, but said it would be
inspected to determine the condition of the passenger seats and the
extent of fire damage they suffered.
   Although most of the 22 federal investigators returned to
Washington over the Labor Day weekend, several remained in Texas.
   ``A good number are there that are just finishing up in terms of
collecting, typing up their notes,'' said Benson. ``This is a
difficult accident.''
   Benson said the same group of investigators who spoke with the
crew's first officer and an injured flight attendant would question
Davis. However, they may have to return to Texas to speak with the
captain.
   Investigators have evidence indicating that the wing flaps were
completely or almost completely retracted. But they were told by
Flight Engineer Stephen Judd that the wing flaps were extended in
the proper position for takeoff.
   During a briefing Sunday, NTSB member Lee Dickinson said more
evidence had been collected on the position of the wing flaps. ``We
have further verification that the flaps were retracted,'' he said.
   Pilots said if the wing flaps were retracted that could be a
sign the crew was trying to fly the plane on one engine.
   Dickinson refused to speculate on reports that two engines
failed.
   A recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine
failure.
   The plane's cockpit remained at the site Monday, sealed in a
plastic blue tarpaulin adjacent to a row of seats pulled from the
plane. The cockpit was to be hauled to Delta headquarters in
Atlanta, but officials decided to leave it at the airport, Benson
said.
   ``We found a hangar we will put it in,'' Benson said. ``We'll be
able to do the work there on site and won't have to go through
shipping and those problems.''

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush compared Michael Dukakis
with liberal anti-war activist Jane Fonda on Monday and attacked
his Democratic rival's views on defense, the economy, taxes, crime
and the death penalty.
   Plunging into the final nine weeks of the neck-and-neck race for
president, Bush turned up the rhetorical heat on Dukakis.
   ``How gloomy he is'' about the economy, Bush said.
   The vice president said that Dukakis' views on defense were
``the standard litany of the liberal left'' and his attitude about
new weapons was ``governed by blind negative ideology.''
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks a naval exercise is
something you find in Jane Fonda's workout book,'' Bush said. Ms.
Fonda, an actress now best known for producing exercise books and
videotapes, infuriated many people during the Vietnam war by
traveling to Hanoi and posing with North Vietnamese military
personnel to dramatize her opposition to U.S. policy in Southeast
Asia.
   Highlighting Bush's pro-defense stance, two aircraft carriers
rested at anchor across the harbor as the vice president spoke to a
sun-drenched Labor Day audience of several hundred people outside a
wholesale fish company.
   Bill Lacy, the head of Bush's campaign in California, said the
vice president was trailing Dukakis in the state by three to seven
points.
   Bush's appearance was marred by several dozen noisy protesters
carrying Dukakis-Bentsen signs and chanting, ``Where was George?''
and ``Bush and Noriega.'' Employees of the fish company held up
cardboard boxes to block the demonstrators from cameramen until
Bush campaign aides ordered the shields taken down.
   Meanwhile, the Secret Service and police said that a man with a
stun gun hanging from his belt was taken into custody.
   ``Right now it appears there was no danger involved to the vice
president,'' said Steve Sergek, the special agent in charge of the
San Diego field office of the U.S. Secret Service.
   ``The person did nothing to present a harm to either the vice
president or anyone else there,'' Sergek said.
   Bush began the day by touring the Chesapeake Fish Co., a family
owned wholesale fish processing concern whose booming sales are
attributed in part to heavy demand from sushi restaurants in the
area.
   Later, he traveled to Anaheim, Calif., and gave a Disneyland
send-off to U.S. Olympic athletes headed for the Summer Games in
Seoul, South Korea.
   ``You're representing a country that is wide open and free as a
breeze, where the millionaire has no more vote than the pauper and
where even school children know the words: `I know my rights,'''
Bush said, surrounded by the athletes and Disney characters.
   The vice president rounded out the day by attending a holiday
picnic with Los Angeles policemen. ``I mean to win this election,''
he declared.
   Cheered by the lawmen and their families, Bush called for
tougher sentences for criminals, including the death penalty for
people convicted of killing police officers.
   ``I will appoint to the federal bench judges who have a little
more concern about the victims of crime and a little less concern
about the criminals,'' Bush said.
   Bush told the San Diego audience, ``This campaign is about many
things, but if I had to set some priorities, I'd say (it is)
foremost about jobs and peace. It's about protecting the gains that
we've made in jobs and peace and it's about how to make new
breakthroughs in both areas.''
   He credited the Reagan-Bush administration with creating 17{
million new jobs since the end of the 1981-82 recession and scorned
Dukakis for the Massachusetts governor's criticism of the economy.
   ``All my opponent can do is try to tell the American people how
bad everything is,'' Bush said.
   On the subject of crime, Bush said Dukakis would turn the clock
back to ``the fuzzy old days of liberal thinking'' when the
perpetrators of crime, rather than its victims, were viewed with
more compassion.
   ``To the people of California, let me put it this way: If you
loved Rose Bird, you'll love my opponent. They oppose the death
penalty, no matter how brutal the crime that's been committed.''
   Bush was referring to the State Supreme Court chief justice who
was voted off the bench by California's voters in a campaign that
highlighted Ms. Bird's liberal views on criminal matters.
   Bush also lambasted the prison furlough program in Massachusetts
and said that ``no more furloughs for people who rape, pillage and
plunder in the United States.''
   On defense matters, Bush criticized Dukakis for opposing the MX
and Midgetman missiles, the Strategic Defense Intiaitive and two
new aircraft carriers.
   ``We've got to look at every new idea and every defense system
from the point of view of, `will it work, does it make sense and do
we need it to make our country safer?
   ``If the answers are `yes,' then at least it warrants our most
serious attention and then sorting out our financial priorities,''
Bush said. ``We can't just dismiss every new idea with a breezy,
`We already have enough weapons.'''
   On pocketbook issues, he said that his primary goal will be to
provide a job to all Americans. Bush pledged anew to resist any
move in Congress to increase federal spending and government
regulation of business.
   ``And when they say I'll raise taxes, I will say no, and they'll
push, and I'll say no again, and they'll push again, and finally
I'll say: `Read my lips _ no new taxes.''
   ``Why do you think they call it Taxachusetts?'' Bush said,
referring to state tax increases in Massachusetts under Dukakis.
   Underscoring the importance of California in the White House
sweepstakes, and its cache of 47 Electoral College votes _ the
biggest prize in the country _ Bush said, ``It's going to be a
long, tough fight,'' and added: ``California, here I come.''

<HEAD>Six Still Missing After Ramstein Disaster; Death Toll At 52</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from the Ramstein
air show disaster has climbed to 52, and a West German official
said Monday that six people reported missing after the fiery
tragedy still have not been located.
   More than 400 missing person reports were filed within two days
after the Aug. 28 air crash, and police have closed almost all of
the cases.
   ``There are six people missing still,'' said Juergen Dietzen,
spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate state, where the U.S. Air Base
at Ramstein is located.
   But he said that does not mean the six West Germans are victims
of the crash.
   ``Perhaps they went to the air show at Ramstein and then went on
holiday without informing anyone,'' Dietzen told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. ``And it's not even certain they
were at the air show.''
   West German federal police as well as Interpol, the
international police agency, are helping in the search, Dietzen
said.
   Dietzen said ``a few'' of the people initially reported missing
were found among bodies that at first could not be identified. He
said others were located among the wounded who were unable to
communicate because of their injuries.
   He said most of the missing person reports were resolved after
those who filed the reports got calls from their relatives saying
they were all right.
   Meanwhile, another person died on Sunday from severe burns
suffered when three Italian fighter planes crashed during an aerial
acrobatic display and one of the aircraft plunged into the crowd.
   The latest death brings the death toll to 52. The dead include
the three Italian pilots involved in the crash, 45 Germans, two
Americans, and one victim each from France and the Netherlands.
   Dietzen said seven of the fatalities were children, 12 were
women and 33 were men. He said 164 people remain hospitalized.
   ``Thirty of those have serious injuries, and of the 30 some have
life-threatening conditions,'' Dietzen told the The Associated
Press.
   Seven Americans hospitalized at the U.S. Army medical center in
nearby Landstuhl are in ``good condition,'' a hospital spokeswoman
said.
   ``They're able to sit up and talk,'' Landstuhl hospital
spokeswoman Marie Shaw told the AP in a telephone interview.
   Ms. Shaw could not say when the patients, still being treated
for burns, would be released.
   An estimated 300,000 spectators were at the U.S. air base's
annual air show when the jets collided.

<TEXT>
   Crews cleared mudslides from roads Monday and
took food and other supplies to thousands of people stranded in
southern Mexico by floods that killed at least 28 people.
   At least 16 of the dead and the largest group of homeless,
25,000, were in northern Veracruz state, which took the brunt of
Hurricane Debby on Friday, said Maj. Javier Lopez Medel, assistant
state public security director.
   The hurricane dissipated after coming ashore from the Caribbean,
but rain continued Monday in much of the region and in Mexico City.
   Flood waters were reported subsiding in some areas, but
officials said they feared rain in the mountains would make the
waters rise again.
   Mud and rock loosened by more than a week of rain slid onto
roads, blocking or slowing traffic on several major highways.
   Most of the casualties and displaced people lived between Tuxpan
and Poza Rica, 150 miles northeast of Mexico City, and just inland.
Debby struck land in that area.
   Among the dead was a 3-year-old girl from Tuxpan, killed
Saturday when a wall of her home fell on her, said Matilde Albino
of the Red Cross in Tuxpan. She said parts of the town remained
under 4{ feet of water.
   About 8,000 of the homeless were in Alamo, 15 miles inland from
Tuxpan, said Guadalupe Lopez, a spokeswoman for the Veracruz state
government.
   Lopez Medel said the Cazones River overflowed Monday, cutting
the coast road between Veracruz and Tampico.
   No estimates of total damage were available.
   About 600 people fled their homes in Mexico City late Sunday
when rivers flooded but they were returning Monday, a Red Cross
worker said.
   Jore Bautizo Espinosa, the mayor of Poza Rica, 22 miles south of
Tuxpan, said people were repairing their homes and cleaning away
the mud. He said a number of houses built on the banks of gullies
that cut through the city of 300,000 people were washed away, but
he did not have a specific number.
   Relief teams were using boats to deliver supplies to towns that
could not be reached by road, he added.
   Light rain continued on the Pacific coast, where Hurricane
Kristy dumped rain last week but never went ashore, the national
weather service said.
   The resort of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo was isolated for a third day,
stranding hundreds of tourists. Crews drained water from runways
but bad weather prevented flights, said Francisco Javier Rangel, a
Guerrero state government spokesman.
   Highways up the coast to Lazaro Cardenas, south to Acapulco and
inland to Mexico City were damaged or blocked by mudslides, he said.
   He estimated 3,000 to 4,000 people had been evacuated from their
homes in the state and said: ``Some communities are isolated,
without telephones or road access mainly because of the rain. The
army is giving assistance everywhere. Brigades from the state
government have been checking communities since Saturday night, but
communication is bad.''
   More than 20,000 people were evacuated or lost their homes in
Chiapas, the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada said in a report from
the state on Mexico's southern border.

   Residents are wondering whether one of
their neighbors in this town of 14,500 will step forward and claim
the world's largest single lottery jackpot.
   The winning ticket for Florida's $54 million Lotto prize was
bought at one of Longwood's 24 lottery outlets, lottery officials
said.
   Some people are so curious about the winner's identity that
they've flagged down police officers on patrol.
   ``People are really interested,'' said officer Robert Hemmert.
``We're up in the air. We're just as curious as anybody else.''
   Residents may have to wait a while. Last month, it took Emily
Davidheiser 10 days to step forward and identify herself as the
winner of a $26 million jackpot.
   Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes. Lottery offices are
closed until Tuesday.
   Although lottery officials can't project the exact payout until
Tuesday, the annual payment to one winner would be about $2.16
million each year after taxes, using a lottery department formula
that divides total winnings by 20 years and deducts 20 percent of
the yearly windfall for taxes.
   Longwood Mayor David Gunter said he was pleased the winning
ticket was bought in his town, once known as the poultry capital of
Florida.
   ``It might put Longwood on the map now,'' he said. ``Whether
they just bought the ticket here or whether they live here, it
means a lot to a community like this.
   ``We're going to take the credit. It feels good.''
   The week's lottery frenzy was a bonanza for promoting the
Florida lottery, which has set numerous sales records in its first
year and attracted worldwide attention.
   The huge jackpot pushed Saturday sales to 14.6 million and total
weekly Lotto purchases to 44.78 million.
   The jackpot for this week's Florida Lotto drawing will begin at
$7 million.
   The Florida jackpot topped the previous record prize for a
numbers game, the $51.4 million shared by two people who bought
winning tickets for California's lottery on June 4.
   Florida's single-ticket win also set a record for the largest
individual Lotto prize, beating the $46 million won on one ticket
in the Pennsylvania lottery in October 1987.

<TEXT>
   More than one-quarter of Britain's postal workers
walked off their jobs Monday as a nationwide mail strike spread and
prevented the delivery of 65 million foreign and domestic letters
and parcels.
   Three postal workers were arrested in Liverpool, one of 40
cities where sorting offices were paralyzed by the strikes by
48,000 workers, said the national post office, Royal Mail.
   Royal Mail, which handles 51 million items of mail daily, said
the three were charged with disorderly behavior after bottles were
thrown from a picket line at arriving temporary workers.
   It was the first instance of violence in six days of strikes
that began Wednesday with a 24-hour strike to protest regional pay
differences.
   The one-day strike officially ended, but the issue of temporary
workers hired to clear backlogs has continued to keep workers away
from their jobs.
   On Monday, London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh
and Glasgow were among cities where mail could not be collected,
posted, sorted or delivered due to walkouts by 48,000 of 140,000
sorting and collecting workers.
   Stamps could be purchased because 40,000 administration and
counter workers have not gone on strike.
   International mail was completely suspended ``until further
notice'' after walkouts at sorting offices for foreign mail in
London and other cities, said post office spokeswoman Sally
Williams.
   Ms. Williams said although workers at London's Heathrow airport
office had gone back to work, other offices were not in operation.
   Bill Cockburn, managing director of Royal Mail, defended the
hiring of 3,500 temporary workers, saying the number hired exceeded
by only 500 the number used at other peak times such as Christmas.
   But Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the Union of
Communications Workers, said the dispute could escalate further,
and the whole system could be stopped by midweek.
   Ms. Williams said exploratory talks between the union and
management were scheduled for Monday night to ``see whether there
is a basis for further negotiations.'' Union leaders met in
England, Scotland and Wales earlier Monday to decide their course
of action, union officials said.
   The strike Wednesday centered on union objections to the post
office offering weekly bonuses of 7.5 pounds to 20 pounds ($12.52
to $33.40) to recruit workers in London and southeast England.
   The union said it would not tolerate regional pay differences
and any bonuses should be paid nationally.
   In another British labor dispute, the Trades Union Congress
voted overwhelmingly Monday to expel the electricians' union, its
first ouster of an affiliate in 15 years.
   Delegates of the electricians' 336,000-member union showed their
disdain by walking out minutes before the vote. The vote, by a show
of hands, came on the opening day of the Trades Union's week-long
annual conference in Bournemouth, England.
   The Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union was ousted
for signing two single-union, no-strike pacts with management in
violation of Trades Union policy. Under such agreements a plant's
work force is represented by a single union and disputes are
settled by arbitration.
   The Trades Union policy is that such contracts weaken union
bargaining power and lead to competition among unions for
representation in a shrinking job market.

<HEAD>Talks Break Down Between Sinn Fein And Moderate Catholic Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven months of talks between
the Social Democratic and Labor Party of moderate Roman Catholics
and Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed IRA, have
broken down, both parties said Monday.
   The closed-door talks on the future of Northern Ireland
foundered largely as a result of Sinn Fein's refusal to renounce
violence by the mainly Catholic Irish Republican Army, the Social
Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) said.
   SDLP leader John Hume and Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams had
carried out the negotiations.
   The IRA has stepped up attacks on British security forces. It
has killed 27 military men this year in attacks in Northern
Ireland, mainland Britain and continental Europe while 11 IRA
guerrillas have been killed by British soldiers.
   The IRA, outlawed on both sides of the Irish border, wants to
unite Northern Ireland, a British province where Protestants
outnmuber Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Republic
of Ireland under socialist rule. The SDLP also wants to unite
Northern Ireland with the republic but by peaceful means.
   Both sides said disagreement also arose over two other issues.
   One was the SDLP's contention that the province's Protestant
majority should have the veto power over Northern Ireland's future.
The other was SDLP insistence that since the Anglo-Irish Agreement
was signed in November 1985, Britain's role in the province has
been a neutral one.
   Sinn Fein said in a statement that maintaining that Britain ``is
now a neutral party to the conflict ... ignores all the historical
evidence of British domination in Ireland and is wholly
contradicted by the events of the past 20 years.''
   Sinn Fein said it was dismayed to find the SDLP accepted
existence of a Protestant veto over the future of the province.
   Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement between London and Dublin, the
Irish Republic was given a formal consultative role in running the
province.
   In exchange, Ireland accepted long-term British rule in Northern
Ireland by acknowledging no change can be made in its status until
a majority of people there agree. Britain pledged to withdraw from
Northern Ireland once a majority of people there indicate they want
it to do so.
   An SDLP statement said: ``Violence, or what Sinn Fein called
`armed struggle,' is wrong and has no contribution to make to a
resolution of the conflict in Ireland. Even in the IRA's terms,
justification no longer exists for the use of such methods. There
are no obstacles on the road to achieving their political
objectives which justify the use of armed force.''
   The SDLP said it and Sinn Fein agreed ``the Irish people as a
whole have the right to national self-determination.''
   But it said the violence ``is directly responsible for more
fatalities in the Roman Catholic community in the past 10 years
than either the security forces or the ... (Protestant extremists).
It also bears much responsibility for the massive unemployment and
deprivation in the Catholic community.''
   The Sinn Fein statement said the question, on which both parties
agreed, was ``how do we end the British presence in a manner which
leaves behind a stable and peaceful Ireland.''
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey's government in Dublin said in a
statement it shared Hume's disappointment that the SDLP's effort to
extend the political peace process had not succeeded. There was no
immediate reaction from the British government.

   Demonstrators in wheelchairs blocked Greyhound
terminals in several U.S. cities Monday claiming buses are
inaccessible to disabled riders, and several landed in jail when
they refused police orders to move.
   In some cases, demonstrators organized by American Disabled for
Accessible Public Transportation, or ADAPT, blocked Labor Day
travelers' entry to buses, police said.
   ``This is a very busy day for us,'' said George Gravley, a
spokesman for Dallas-based Greyhound Lines Inc. ``It's a holiday
weekend. People are going home and thousands of people are being
inconvenienced because buses are being delayed.''
   Five protesters in wheelchairs and one blind demonstrator were
arrested in Dallas and taken to jail, said police Sgt. K. Walters.
A jailer said $213 bond each was set, but she did not know how many
were jailed.
   Arrests also occurred in Louisville, Ky., and Denver, and an
organizer said the protests occurred in a dozen cities.
   Joe Carley, a demonstrator at the Dallas terminal, said society
has ``spent thousands of dollars keeping us alive and they say, `We
have spent this money to keep you alive we're not going to spend
any money to see that you can live.' And accessibility is living.''
   Protesters want Greyhound to install lifts on buses to make them
more accessible to the handicapped.
   ``We're asking them to sign an agreement that any new bus built
will be accessible,'' said the Rev. Wade Blank, an ADAPT spokesman
in Denver.
   Greyhound officials met with leaders of the Denver-based ADAPT
in August.
   ``We went through all of this in Denver,'' Gravley said. ``We
thought we responded in a forthright way to issues they raised. We
are disappointed obviously that the demonstrations continued.''
   In Denver, 10 people, including eight in wheelchairs, were cited
for disturbing the peace. The protest shifted to the Denver City
Jail after police officers booked the two able-bodied people, but
released those in wheelchairs, said Blank.
   Two hours later, they too were released, and a police officer at
the scene told the protesters they had been booked due to a
misunderstanding.
   In Louisville, Ky., a protest involving 25 people resulted in
the arrest of eight demonstrators, six in wheelchairs. The eight
were charged with failure to disperse and obstruction of a highway
and released on their own recognizance.
   Blank said protests also were scheduled Monday in Atlanta,
Savannah, Ga., Salt Lake City, Utah, Phoenix, San Francisco and Los
Angeles. Another demonstration was set for Tuesday at the Greyhound
terminal in Chicago, he said.
   Gravley said a Greyhound subsidiary has applied for a grant to
use toward designing an exprimental bus that would be accessible to
the disabled. He said the company has proposed enlisiting the help
of an advisory group that would include ADAPT members, the Texas
Commission for The Handicapped, and a retired people's group.
   Greyhound operates Helping Hands, a program that provides a free
ticket for disabled people who are unable to travel by themselves.
But to avoid fraudulent use of the program, the bus carrier
requires users to provide proof of their disability, Gravley said.
   ``This handicapped organization feels that's demeaning and they
ought to be the judge of whether they travel alone,'' Gravley said.
   ADAPT also objects to Greyhound's requirements that
non-motorized wheelchairs be stored in baggage compartments and
battery-operated wheelchairs be kept off buses. Greyhound cites
concerns about battery acid leaking.

<HEAD>Non-Aligned Proposal Calls For Sanctions Against Israel, South
Africa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers preparing Monday for
the non-aligned movement conference discussed proposals that
contain sanctions against Israel and South Africa.
   The five-day conference of foreign ministers is to chart the
101-member organization's role over the next decade. Organizers
said 92 members plan to attend, including 70 foreign ministers.
   President George Vassilou formally opens the three-day
conference on Wednesday.
   But delegates on Monday began considering a 60-page draft
resolution dealing with international problems.
   The draft sharply criticizes Israel and South Africa, echoing
previous sentiments of the movement.
   A copy of the draft notes that since the non-aligned summit
conference last year the situation in the Middle East ``has
worsened considerably, particularly as a result of the actions of
the Israeli occupation forces against the civilian population in
the occupied territories.''
   The draft ``salutes the heroic uprising of the Palestinian
people,'' in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. It says
the Arab uprising in the occupied lands that began Dec. 8 is
``tangible evidence of their determination to have a state of their
own.''
   It demands United Nations sanctions against Israel.
   The draft also expresses ``profound alarm at the sharp
deterioration of the situation in South Africa'' and repeats
previous demands for sanctions against the South African
government, which is controlled by the country's white minority.
   The resolution expresses satisfaction with the July 20
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and states the U.N.-mediated peace
talks in Geneva should lead to a ``a comprehensive and lasting
solution'' in the 8-year-old war between the Persian Gulf rivals.
   The draft makes no reference to Iraqi use of chemical weapons in
the war.
   Conference sources speaking on condition of anonymity said
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati is expected to demand
Iraq's condemnation on that issue when he addresses the conference
on Wednesday.
   More than 1,500 police officers, including special
anti-terrorist units, have been assigned to guard the conference
center where the meeting is being held and the delegates' hotels.

<HEAD>More Recruits Released From Hospital After Mysterious Illness</HEAD>

   Officials still had not determined Monday what
caused a mysterious outbreak that sent 119 young Navy recruits to
the hospital over the weekend with breathing problems, vomiting and
other symptoms.
   Only one of the recruits remained in a hospital after two were
released Monday. The enlisted men from the Naval Training Center
were taken to 10 hospitals in more than 50 ambulances Saturday, and
all but three were released by Sunday night.
   Two more men were released Monday in good condition from Sharp
Cabrillo Hospital, said nursing supervisor Nadine Kalmonson. A
third recruit who was diagnosed with pneumonia was still being held
at the Balboa Hospital, said Navy spokesman Lt. Ken Luchka.
   ``It could have been that one or two people had a viral
infection and got sick, which caused a mass hysteria to the
others,'' Luchka said.
   A hysterical reaction was ``very possible, like in second grade,
when someone vomits and the whole class starts vomiting,'' Luchka
said.
   Navy officials also speculated whether the symptoms may have
been brought on by the extreme heat, heavy smog and strenuous
exercise.
   Environmental health officials, a hazardous materials unit and a
medical unit inspected the barracks but were unable to pinpoint an
explanation for the outbreak, said Petty Officer Pat Neal.
   Hospital tests failed to reveal any poisons in the recruits'
systems, she said.
   The men who returned to the center spent Sunday and Monday
relaxing and were to resume their third week of basic training. The
week's training schedule included classroom sessions and no
physical activity.

   The trial of Yuri M. Churbanov, 51, an ex-first deputy interior

Gorbachev's drive to break with the cronyism and corruption now
seen as endemic under Brezhnev, who ran the Soviet Union as

   Churbanov, who is charged with bribe-taking and abuse of office,

   The consumer advocates want the Federal Communications
Commission to cancel increases scheduled for December and next
April in the ``line charge'' added to residential phone bills.
   Their call is being heard by some members of Congress and the
state utility commissioners, who at the very least want the FCC to
take a second vote on the added charges before they take effect.
   The increases _ 60 cents per month on Dec. 1 and 30 cents on
April 1, 1989 _ were approved as part of a three-step boost in the
monthly line charge that began with a 60-cent increase July 1,
1987. The monthly charge is already $2.60.
   The FCC approved the increases in April 1987 as a way to further
reduce long-distance rates and encourage large business users to
stay on the public phone network rather than building their own
networks.
   But the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates
is asking the FCC to cancel the future increases _ amounting to
about $1 billion a year _ saying they are ``unnecessary,
unsupported and unwarranted.''
   The association said three telecommunications analysts
commissioned by the group to study a June report compiled by the
FCC on the effects of the subscriber line charge concluded that the
threat of large users bypassing the local phone network has not
materialized. Increasing the charge by 90 cents will have no effect
on the bypass that is already occurring, they said.
   ``We've really attacked the very basis for the subscriber line
charge,'' said Ron Binz, Colorado consumer counsel.
   The line charge helps pay the cost of the wire that connects a
customer's telephone with a phone company's central office. Part of
the cost of that line also is subsidized with long-distance rates,
so raising the proportion paid by subscribers reduces long-distance
rates. Long-distance rates have dropped more than 30 percent since
the charge was imposed in 1985.
   Raising the line charge also reduces local connection fees paid
by large business users. Some businesses find it economical to
build their own telecommunications networks and bypass the public
phone network.
   The FCC continues to support the subscriber line charge and the
underlying policy of shifting the costs of the local phone network
to subscribers, said FCC spokesman John Kamp.
   ``The policy ... has worked very well. Bypass has not grown and
it has caused rates overall to come down considerably, and we have
not seen evidence to cause us to change course,'' he said.
   The agency, however, will ``look very carefully'' at the
consumer advocates' requests to cancel the scheduled increases, he
said.
   But the consumer advocates' group has already taken its case to
Congress, where it is talking to Democratic members of the
communications committees, most of whom opposed the original
imposition of the line charge at $1 in June 1985 and the later
increases.
   The issue ``has caught Congress' eye,'' said Gerard Salemme, an
aide to Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications subcommittee, particularly because of concerns
about an FCC proposal to give AT&T and the local Bell phone
companies more financial flexibility by capping rates but lifting
the lid on profits.
   Salemme said that if price caps were adopted, regulators would
have little or no assurance that the line-charge increases were
being passed along in the form of reduced long-distance rates.
   The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners is
urging Congress to pressure the FCC into taking a second vote on
the further increases after reviewing the effects of the current
charges.
   ``There is still a lot of healthy skepticism'' among state
regulatory commissioners about the need for further increases in
the line charge, said Sharon Nelson, chairwoman of the
association's communications committee and head of the Washington
state utilities commission.
   ``They've been very dubious about this from the very
beginning,'' she said.

   High poverty rates for young families are
getting America's youth off to ``the worst possible start,'' warns
the head of a group promoting the interests of children.
   ``Our children and our young families are this nation's growing
edge. We neglect them at our peril,'' said Marian Wright Edelman,
president of the Children's Defense Fund.
   The comments came with the release of a study commissioned by
the group, which found that the economic growth of the last few
years hasn't benefited young American families.
   ``America's young families are afflicted by an economic
depression in the middle of our society's more general
prosperity,'' Edelman said in a statement.
   In terms of constant dollars, the income of families with
children headed by an adult under age 30 fell by about one-fourth
between 1973 and 1986, the fund reported.
   As a result the poverty rate for such families nearly doubled
from 12 percent in 1973 to 22 percent in 1986, the fund said.
   Census Bureau figures for 1987 were released last week and,
while not identical to the children's fund figures, tend to support
the group's assertions.
   The Census Bureau found that the 1987 poverty rate for children
aged 18 and under was 20 percent, up from 14.2 percent in 1973.
Younger families tended to have higher poverty rates than older
ones, the census figures showed.
   Poverty rates for children, whether black, white or Hispanic,
rose between 1973 and 1987, the figures showed, and were higher
than for other families or individuals.
   ``These are the children on whom we must rely to be the workers,
leaders, parents, taxpayers, soldiers and hope of the 21st
century,'' Edelman said. ``We are getting them off to the worst
possible start.''
   In the short term, the Children's Defense Fund called for a
higher minimum wage and passage of the Act for Better Child Care,
legislation pending in Congress to improve services for working
parents.
   Long-term recommendations included extending Medicaid coverage
to pregnant women and children in families with less than twice the
poverty income; expanded tax credits for low-income families;
expanded Head Start programs; setting up community learning centers
for children, and a series of educational and home-buyer assistance
programs.
   The fund describes itself as a non-profit group working to draw
attention to the needs of children, particularly the poor,
minorities and handicapped.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar opened lower today after losing ground
Friday on higher-than-expected U.S. unemployment data. Gold was
slightly weaker.
   Trading on European markets was lulled by the U.S. Labor Day
holiday, dealers said.
   The dollar had fallen sharply on Friday after news that the U.S.
unemployment rate had risen to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in
July. It lost more than a pfennig against the West German mark, a
centime against the Swiss franc and 1{ cents against the Dutch
guilder.
   Traders said they expected the dollar to hold steady through
today, but dealers in Frankfurt forecast a lower dollar in the
medium term.
   ``We expect a further decline this week,'' said one dealer at a
U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.72 yen to a closing 136.03. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 135.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8525 West German marks, down from 1.8665; 1.5593
Swiss francs, down from 1.5725; 6.2985 French francs, down from
6.3365; 2.0933 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1050; 1,378.60 Italian
lire, down from 1,388.50; and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2362.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6850, compared with
$1.6755 Friday.
   Gold was weakened by private investors, particularly from the
Middle East, selling bullion, dealers in London said.
   ``It's a familiar pattern,'' said one. ``With the U.S. out, a
few players try to push a thin market.''
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $428.10 a troy ounce, up
from $427.50 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $427.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $426.90, down from $428 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 1.54 to close at a bid 429.38.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.48 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $6.52.

   The worlds first triangular $2 coin has
almost sold out in the faraway Cook Islands of the South Pacific
after being advertised as money from paradise, a radio report said
Monday.
   Radio Cooks said investors, mostly from New Zealand, had scooped
up virtually all the 90,000 coins that were minted last year.
   Richard McDonald, director of the Cook Islands Numismatics

<HEAD>Little Progress In Subroto Mission On Quota Problem, Survey Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto as one name is correct</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto has made
little headway in his efforts to persuade Iraq to accept an oil
production quota and Iran to allow its Persian Gulf foe one equal
to its own, the Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday.
   But Subroto was quoted by a United Arab Emirates newspaper
Monday as rejecting speculation that he had failed to convince the
two countries to curb their output amid over-production by some
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The Al-Ittihad daily quoted Subroto, now in Qatar for talks on
curbing over-production, as saying after visiting Tehran and
Baghdad last week that he ``now fully knows what the two countries
want.''
   Both countries, economically drained by their 8-year-old war,
are now giving top priority to post-war reconstruction funded by
their oil revenues.
   ``This means that the two countries are keen to have a strong
and cohesive OPEC and get a good price for their oil,'' Subroto was
quoted as saying.
   The Middle East Economic Survey, published in Nicosia, said that
Subroto's mission to Tehran and Baghdad was ``no doubt useful in
terms of getting acquainted with the positions and preoccupations
of the parties.''
   But the weekly said Subroto's talks did not appear to have
``yielded any concrete results'' in settling the Iran-Iraq quota
problem.
   Iraq has refused to accept an OPEC quota of 1.5 million barrels
a day and is demanding parity with Iran, which has a quota of 2.369
million barrels a day. OPEC's 11 other members agree that Iraq
should have parity.
   Although neither side has publicly announced the outcome of
Subroto's talks, Tehran Radio stressed shortly before Subroto
arrived in the Iranian capital that Iran would never agree to allow
Iraq an equal quota.
   ``The allocation of an equal quota for Iran and Iraq is entirely
unprincipled ... Quota parity with Iran is in fact a kind of
increase in the Iraqi quota,'' the radio commentary noted.
   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry
newsletter, said the key questions in the thorny quota problem were
whether or not the Iranians are prepared to accept the principle of
quota parity with Iraq and whether ``Iraq itself is willing to
accept such a quota and the production discipline it entails.''
   The weekly added: ``Neither side, it appears, was in any mood to
answer such awkward questions or even to discuss them in anything
but very general terms.''
   It said that the Iranians ``seemed concerned to steer clear of
the parity dilemma altogether'' in their talks with Subroto,
Indonesia's former energy minister.
   ``Instead they concentrated on the broad spectrum of problems
facing OPEC at present _ particularly over-production by certain
member countries _ and Iran's pressing requirements for
reconstruction in the post-war era,'' it said.
   The newsletter also said the Iraqis stressed their
reconstruction needs and ``made it plain to Subroto that in their
view the question of Iraq's quota is only one of a wide spectrum of
important issues facing OPEC.''
   The newsletter noted: ``It would seem ... that, despite
Subroto's brave endeavors, OPEC still has a long, hard road to
travel as regards the Iraqi quota impasse and all its other chronic
disciplinary ailments.''
   Iraq's current production is estimated at 2.8 million barrels a
day, meaning that even if Iran agreed to quota parity, Baghdad's
output would be reduced at a time when it wants to boost production.
   The other major quota violator is the United Arab Emirates. It
has said it wants to produce around 1.5 million barrels a day, more
than one-third above its 948,000-barrel quota.
   The newsletter reported that U.A.E. ouput soared from 1.45
million barrels a day in July to 1.7 million barrels a day last
month ``and is programmed to increase still further to 1.95 million
barrels a day for September.''
   That will heighten pressure on OPEC to solve the over-production
problem, which has helped weaken oil prices from OPEC's benchmark
or $18 a barrel to around $14 or $15.
   The weekly reported last week that overall OPEC production was
estimated at 20 million barrels a day, more than 3.5 million
barrels over the cartel's quota ceiling.
   Al-Ittihad quoted Subroto as saying that if peace talks between
Iran and Iraq slowed down ``confidence in the possibility of
attaining peace will lead to a letdown on the market and
consequently prices will slip.''

<TEXT>
   It was a cold November day in 1966
when attorney and expectant-father Patrick Kennedy looked out a
downtown hospital window toward the vacant grounds of his alma
mater, St. Mary's University School of Law.
   The international exposition HemisFair was two years away and
Kennedy knew the city needed hotel rooms in the tourist area. So as
his daughter was being delivered, Kennedy devised a plan to turn
the Colonial Spanish-style campus into a luxury hotel with a view
of the popular River Walk.
   Kennedy's gamble in what became La Mansion del Rio paid off.
Tourists crowded into the hotel when it opened in April 1968 and
have been coming ever since.
   Today, Kennedy is fighting for survival and claiming that one of
his lenders, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., backed him into a
financial corner to steal his hotels for its own hotel management
subsidiary.
   It's a lawsuit the hotel industry is watching carefully.
   Kennedy's attorneys say his $7 billion lawsuit against
Metropolitan could be a test case because it charges that a lender,
in calculated moves, conspired to become a direct competitor with
its borrower.
   ``My biggest problem with this case is trying to understand why
a company with over $100 billion worth of assets and 100 years of
reputable business dealings would stoop to this practice, and that
is the reason I am willing to go through with this lawsuit,''
Kennedy said recently.
   Metropolitan officials deny any wrongdoing and say the case is a
simple contractual agreement that Kennedy broke by not paying his
bills on time.
   ``I think you are seeing an absolute desperation move,'' said
Metropolitan's San Antonio attorney, Seagal V. Wheatley. ``What you
have is a straight-forward loan. Met breached no agreement with Mr.
Kennedy.''
   Wheatley said Kennedy is using the lawsuit to avoid a threatened
bankruptcy.
   Kennedy's lawsuit charges Metropolitan with fraud, duress,
interference, deceptive trade practices, breach of confidential
relationships, unfair dealing and conspiracy in what he claims was
a concerted nationwide effort by Metropolitan and its Phoenix-based
subsidiary, Doubletree Hotels Inc., to take over regional,
profitable hotels at a fraction of their worth.
   The fight is scheduled for another round in court on Sept. 12,
but Metropolitan already claims partial victory from state District
Judge Peter Michael Curry's summary judgment in August that
Metropolitan and Doubletree did not conspire to take over La
Mansion.
   But Kennedy's attorneys are pressing ahead, claiming that
Metropolitan wants to postpone a jury trial until 1989 to drain
Kennedy's resources.
   ``If we can get to a jury and show a jury how Metropolitan was
telling Doubletree that they would be taking over La Mansion
hotels, even before Pat had any problems, and then put the
incredible squeeze on Pat, I think a jury is going to be
offended,'' said Kennedy's attorney, Larry Macon.
   Kennedy was 36 when he transformed the old campus into a luxury
hotel.
   Success fueled expansion desires and Kennedy approached
Metropolitan. In July 1978, the 300-room La Mansion del Norte
opened in San Antonio with an $8.1 million loan from the insurer.
   In 1981, Metropolitan refinanced Kennedy's mortgage to expand
the chain again, increasing his loan to $11.25 million.
   In 1982, Kennedy, in partnership with an investment group,
started construction of La Mansion-Austin financed by Metropolitan
servicing agent American General Insurance Co. The 300-room Austin
hotel opened in April 1984.
   The three hotels, Macon claims, are worth about $80 million.
   Kennedy alleges that between 1981 and 1984, Metropolitan began
thinking of taking over La Mansion after the insurance giant
acquired 20 percent of Doubletree Hotels.
   With the Texas economy on a slide in the mid-1980s, Kennedy's
hotels suffered like others. During that time, Kennedy alleges,
Metropolitan told Doubletree his hotels were in trouble and could
become targets for Doubletree takeovers.
   In July 1986, Doubletree Hotels president Jim Schmidt contacted
him about a franchising plan, but Kennedy declined the offer, he
said.
   That fall Kennedy decided to restructure his management company
and began talking to his lenders. He claims he could not reach a
satisfactory arrangement with Metropolitan.
   ``We reduced his monthly payments by 50 percent and he claims
that we dealt very hard with him,'' said Wheatley.
   The attorney said Kennedy's 1986 restructuring earned him more
than $1 million at a time Kennedy claimed he couldn't make payments
for his north property.
   Kennedy talked with other lenders and agreed to give up
ownership but retain management control of La Mansion del Rio and
La Mansion-Austin.
   In the summer of 1987, unable to find an investor in the hotel,
Kennedy received an extension on his loan payment from
Metropolitan, but by that December, Arnholt declared the loan in
default and threatened foreclosure on La Mansion del Norte.
   The same month, American General Life Insurance posted La
Mansion-Austin for foreclosure and fired Kennedy's management
company. This January, Doubletree began to manage the Austin hotel
after Wheatley claimed it exhausted its search for a management
company.
   In February, Metropolitan planned to foreclose on La Mansion del
Norte and Doubletree employees prepared to move in, but Kennedy
filed suit, obtained a temporary restraining order and kept
Metropolitan from taking over.
   Now, Metropolitan claims that Kennedy is on a free ride, not
having paid a dime for the hotel's debt service since 1986 while
continuing to draw fees for managing the hotel.
   Attorneys for both sides said they're not sure what will happen
on Sept. 12.

   Case: General Motors Corp. wants to
replace two assembly plants but keep operations near Detroit. The
only available site is in Poletown _ and if the company builds
there it has to level 1,200 homes and force out 3,500 residents.
   Case: Allied Chemical Corp. must decide whether to support a
federal toxic substances control act after one of its pesticides
encounters environmental problems. It also must grapple with an
internal policy that would restrict some product uses _ and sales.
   What should a corporate executive do?
   Spurred in part by complex new moral dilemmas and publicized
incidents of criminal wrongdoing, the Harvard Business School is
requiring its 800 incoming students this fall to think about those
and other ethical questions.
   Scholars said the three-week mini-course at the 80-year-old
graduate school is part of a nationwide trend to devote more
resources to teaching and research on moral reasoning and ethical
values in corporate America.
   ``It's become sufficiently clear that the business leader of the
future is going to have to be conversant and thoughtful about
ethics,'' said Kenneth E. Goodpaster, a philosopher who came to the
Harvard Business School in 1980 to help develop an ethics
curriculum.
   One goal of the Harvard course is to make future business
leaders consider the impact of their decisions. It joins philosophy
with case study to stimulate dialogue on questions that defy easy
answers.
   The Harvard course will tackle such topics as corporate
responsibility in a plant relocation, limits of economic reasoning
in environmental waste issues, conflicting cultural values in
international business, and organizational pressures against
honesty and integrity.
   What courses at Harvard and other universities don't do is
prescribe a set of morals. You can't teach ethics, scholars said;
graduate students bring with them values developed over a lifetime.
   ``We're not trying to make bad people all of a sudden turn into
saints,'' said Joanne Ciulla, a philosopher who teaches ethics at
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ``It's not coming
up with the right answer. It's going through the process and
understanding what are the issues and what are the values _ what do
we have to think about here?''
   Business ethics isn't a new field. In 1915, Harvard offered a
class on ``Social Factors in Business Enterprise.'' After the 1929
stock market crash, Harvard hired a philosopher to teach ethics as
society reacted to the Depression by attacking greed in business.
   Wharton, which has three ethics specialists, this year for the
first time is requiring students to attend two ethics sessions
during orientation. International business students take a class on
cross-cultural ethics, while the graduate and undergraduate
divisions have offered a business ethics course since 1975.
   Columbia University's business school has required a course on
social responsibility since the the mid-1960s, the University of
Virginia has had an applied ethics center for about 20 years and
requires first-year students to take a class similar to Harvard's,
while Stanford offers an ethics elective.
   With an increasing number of cases like the Ivan Boesky insider
trading and the Wedtech defense scandals, those schools are
intensifying research in ethics, and Harvard is hosting a
conference on the subject in December. Still, only about 10 percent
of business students nationwide are required to study ethics.
   Harvard last year received a reported $20 million pledge from
former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad to
study ethics, part of a university-wide program to boost research
in the field in the professional schools.
   Scholars said the study of business over the last 30 years has
become more scientific _ numbers-crunching and bottom-line analysis
at the expense of ethics, corporate purpose and corporate
responsibility.
   ``I don't have difficulty putting forth certain values where at
least alarms ought to go off,'' said Thomas R. Piper, Harvard's
senior associate dean for education programs. ``But I also think
the emphasis should be on the awareness of the breadth of impact.''
   Starting in the late 1950s and '60s, business schools emphasized
that the goal of a company should be maximizing the individual
stockholder's wealth. Now researchers talk about the impact of
business decisions on all ``stakeholders'' _ workers, communities,
customers, future generations.
   ``Wherever you draw the line on insider trading, meeting someone
in an alley with $400,000 in a suitcase is not a hard issue,'' said
R. Edward Freeman, director of the University of Virginia's Olsson
Center of Applied Ethics.
   ``The more important stuff is how do you put ethics in the
center of business decision-making every day,'' he said. ``We try
to make students understand that in every decision they make,
they're making a moral choice.''

   The country's largest labor federation says
the hourly wage in Mexico has fallen to one of the lowest in the
world in the past six years.
   Mexicans who earned the equivalent of $1.90 an hour in 1982 now
earn 40 cents an hour, the Mexican Labor Federation said.
   The minimum wage, last raised in March, is 8,000 pesos a day, or
about $3.50.
   The federation said high payments on the foreign debt were
draining the economy. It warned that the loss of buying power
generates discontent and could endanger the stability of the
country.
   A government anti-inflation program has brought the increase in
consumer prices down from a monthly rate of 15.5 percent in January
to 1.7 percent in July. Inflation in 1987 was a record 159.2
percent.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES With London Shares Closing Up Amid Low Volume</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed higher Monday, helped by
lingering bullish sentiment from U.S. employment figures released
last Friday.
   Price markups by market participants extended a rally begun
Friday on the back of the unemployment data, which showed the U.S.
economy did not expand in August quite as fast as had been expected.
   The data allayed concerns that U.S. interest rates still might
have to rise further to douse an overheating economy.
   Analysts said shares were also moving better because, for the
time being, fears of rising U.K. interest rates have been pushed
into the background. However, market watchers were quick to point
out that participation remained painfully low Monday.
   At the end of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 17.6 points, or 1.00 percent, at 1764.5. The
index opened 10.2 points higher and bounced as much as 20.4 points
higher by mid-morning to its best level of the day.
   Meanwhile, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up
14.6 points at 1420.5. Volume was extremely light, with a scant
284.8 million shares changing hands, compared with the 443.8
million shares Friday. Of Monday's total, 192.2 million shares had
been traded by midday.
   Market activity was light in response to a lack of leadership
from Wall Street, which was closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.
   However, several analysts stressed the market's firm undertone
after Friday's healthy U.S. employment figures for August and a
52-point bounce upwards on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. August
unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent and non-farm payroll jobs
created totaled 219,000. The revised July unemployment rate
remained unchanged at 5.4 percent but the non-farm payroll gain was
revised downward to 200,000 jobs from 283,000 jobs.
   Market expectations had been for a 5.4-percent unemployment rate
and non-farm payrolls at 224,000.

<HEAD>IMF Mission Opens Talks on New Stand-by Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief negotiator for the
International Monetary Fund opened talks Monday with government
officials on Argentina's request for a stand-by loan of about $1.2
billion.
   Desmond Lachman was scheduled to meet with Treasury and Central
Bank officials to discuss, among other topics, Argentina's balance
of payments and the anti-inflation plan implemented by President
Raul Alfonsin early last month.
   The IMF funds would be used in part to help Argentina pay
interest on its $56 billion foreign debt. Interest payments on the
debt will total about $4.6 billion this year alone.
   Last week, Argentina reportedly won preliminary approval from
the World Bank for two loans totaling $750 million to reform its
banking system and reorient its trade policy, including the lifting
of restrictions on imports.
   Central Bank President Jose Luis Machinea said early last week
he expected an agreement would be concluded by week's end. However,
no official statement was issued before the World Bank's vice
president for Latin America, Shamid Husain, returned to Washington.
   Lachman is scheduled to be in Argentina for about a week.
   Since Alfonsin took office in December 1983, government policy
has been to finance half the interest payments with Argentine funds
and half with borrowed funds.
   The country's inflation in July exceeded 25 percent. Projections
are that inflation will be at least that high for August, though
Alfonsin and Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille insist the rise in
the cost of living for September will be below 10 percent.
   Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn and Central Bank director
Daniel Marx were scheduled to fly to the United States Tuesday to
meet with commercial banks to arrange new loans totaling between
$1.5 billion and $3 billion.
   Argentina's foreign debt is the third highest in the developing
world behind that of Brazil and Mexico. A new IMF agreement would
carry through the end of Alfonsin's term as president, which ends
in December 1989. National elections are set for next May.

<HEAD>Engineering Firm Settles Two Days Before Federal Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An engineering firm that acted as a
consultant to the Washington Public Supply System on abortive plans
to build two nuclear power plants has settled with bondholders for
$20 million, officials said Monday.
   The settlement between R.W. Beck and Associates of Seattle,
Wash., and bondholders was announced in a statement released by
court-appointed settlement master Junius Hoffman.
   It came two days before the scheduled start of a massive
securities fraud case against WPPSS in federal court here.
   The agreement is subject to approval by U.S. District Court
Judge William Browning, who will preside over the case in which 21
public utilities, two engineering firms and a financial adviser
remain as defendants.
   More than 24,000 bondholders and Chemical Bank of New York, the
trustee for bondholders, allege that the supply system fraudulently
sold $2.25 billion in bonds to build the plants.
   The project was abandoned in 1982 and the supply system declared
default in 1983 after the Washington Supreme Court ruled the public
utilities involved in the project had no authorization to sign
agreements with WPPSS.
   Monday's announcement brought the total settlements so far to
$351 million. Agreement has been reached on an additional $96
million in claims against insurance companies, although the
bondholders must pursue lawsuits to obtain any of that money.
   Last Wednesday the supply system itself settled with the
bondholders for an estimated $3 billion, the cost of the bonds plus
interest.
   Bondholders were expected to see little of that settlement
money, however, because the supply system has few assets to use to
pay back the bonds.

   Five years and more than $150 million in legal
fees later, a giant fraud case stemming from the biggest default in
the history of the municipal bond market is headed for trial
Wednesday in Tucson, Ariz.
   The litigation in federal court is a consolidation of dozens of
lawsuits filed by bondholders after the Washington Public Power
Supply System's 1983 default on $2.25 billion in bonds sold to
finance construction of two nuclear power plants.
   Though it has remained obscure, the so-called ``Whoops'' case
has won notoriety in legal and financial circles for its size and
complexity.
   Consider:
   _Since about 1980 market defaults have totaled about $5.7
billion. ``Forty percent of that is WPPSS,'' said C. Richard
Lehmann of Miami Lakes, Fla., treasurer of the National WPPSS 4-5
Bondholders Committee.
   _Dozens of attorneys from some 70 law firms, with rates as high
as $400 an hour, have been involved in pre-trial work. Still to be
added to the legal tab are trial costs and the fees of many
attorneys who have worked for five years on contingency.
   _A computerized data-retrieval system for the plaintiffs' side
alone has cost more than $35 million, and it holds 14 million
documents and hundreds of statements by witnesses. The defense is
keeping its system secret.
   _More than 24,000 claims have been filed by an estimated 42,000
bondholders.
   _Defendants, from Wall Street bond underwriting firms to 88
public utilities to law firms and economic advisers, originally
numbered more than 100. Some, including bond underwriters, have
settled outside court for $331 million so far. WPPSS itself was let
out of the suit last week in a surprise move, leaving 21 utilities
and engineering and financial adviser firms as defendants.
   _The trial itself could last up to two years.
   ``The WPPSS case is unique,'' said New York University Professor
Robert Lamb, who has written a book on the supply system's woes.
   ``There is nothing like it. Not only in the dollar amount, but
in the complexity of the involvements of different layers of
government and governmental authority, the complexity of the number
of litigants, claimants, and participants.''
   ``All the major brokerage firms were involved, the (bond) rating
agencies were involved, bond counsel were involved, and different
engineering firms, accounting firms, as well as all layers of
government,'' he said.
   Those complexities aside, however, and the case comes down to
who will pick up the tab for the WPPSS default and the ensuing
legal battle _ bondholders alleging fraud who are stuck with nearly
worthless bonds, or electric utility customers in Washington who
will have to pay higher rates if a decision goes against them.
   ``The public is suing the public,'' Matt Dillon, commissioner of
Snohomish County Public Utility District, a defendant, said in
describing the large groups of potential losers.
   Despite the risk of losing, with the potential of a
multibillion-dollar judgment, settlement efforts have fallen short
as trial looms. The $351 million in settlements so far include $92
million from bond underwriters and most of the rest from insurance.
   WPPSS itself was a relatively minor defendant in the recovery
because others named in the action have more resources to tap.
WPPSS, as part of its settlement, agreed not to contest the future
payment of money to reimburse claimants.
   Left among defendants are only 20 Washington utilities, an
Oregon utility, two engineering firms and a financial advisory
firm. But those 21 utilities held about a two-thirds interest in
the abandoned plants.
   While settlement was encouraged by U.S. District Judge William
Browning, efforts to reach a ``global settlement'' involving all
parties fell short last May when defendants declined to counter a
plaintiff offer of something in excess of $1 billion.
   Without such a settlement, the case could last for years, said
Bob Ratcliffe of Portland, Ore., who retired a year ago as deputy
administrator of the federal Bonneville Power Administration.
   ``It's a lose-lose proposition every day that litigation goes
on,'' he said. ``If the litigation runs its course, it won't be
resolved until well into the next century.''
   For the Northwest, he said, the fighting will continue to have
economic costs and take a toll in ill-will and lack of cooperation
by various energy and governmental entities.
   For the bondholders: ``I don't think any of those living today
will see any money. Maybe their heirs will,'' Ratcliffe said.
   And for attorneys? ``I wish I was still practicing law ... since
this is such a marvelous opportunity,'' Ratcliffe, a lawyer, said
sardonically.
   To bondholders, the case is one of giant fraud and conspiracy,
coupled with a shameless lack of integrity among defendants,
including the Northwest as a region. They say utilities knowingly
entered into faulty agreements with the supply system to build the
two plants, WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5.
   The Washington Supreme Court ruled in June 1983 that Washington
utilities among the 88 participants contracting to build the plants
lacked authority to sign the pacts and did not have to pay.
   Chemical Bank of New York, trustee for bondholders, accelerated
debt payment that August, precipitating the default on the debt.
   Ratepayer representatives say misguided leadership in the 1970s,
faulty projections for energy needs, poor planning and reliance on
experts who were simply wrong were among factors that led the
region astray.
   Utility commissioners wrongly believed the plants would be
needed to prevent power brown-outs and the public would accept big
rate hikes, said Jim Lazar of Olympia, a utility consultant.
   ``They are not on trial for being stupid,'' he said. ``They are
on trial for fraud, and that is different.''
   Others said the mishap at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania and a worldwide economic downturn were both critical.
   Though ratepayers have so far escaped paying for WPPSS Nos. 4
and 5, electric rates have increased five-fold in the Northwest to
pay for three other WPPSS nuclear plants. The rates are assessed
through Bonneville, a federal power marketing agency, which in
effect guaranteed payments for the three plants. That BPA
payment-guarantee was not forthcoming for the terminated plants.
   Trial was moved to Tucson on a motion that a jury of Northwest
residents might be reluctant to return a decision that could raise
their electricity rates.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Lower, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No AMs version is expected because of holiday</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished slightly lower against
major currencies in Europe Monday during trading made light by the
close of U.S markets for the Labor Day holiday, dealers said.
   Gold prices finished mixed.
   Light commercial trading late Monday helped the dollar regain
some ground lost earlier in the day in a downward slide that
stopped before the U.S. currency hit 1.8500 West German deutsche
marks.
   ``The market tried again to push the dollar below 1.85 (marks)
in the morning, but it showed good resistance,'' said a dealer in
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Dealers said the currency was helped by the absence of trading
in the United States.
   ``It would have been difficult to sell the dollar at 1.85
(marks) in today's restricted trading environment,'' one dealer
said.
   Dealers in London said Monday morning's decline continued a
dollar plunge begun Friday on news that the U.S. unemployment rate
had risen to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in July.
   Traders said the market will now adopt a wait-and-see attitude,
looking ahead to the release of U.S. merchandise trade figures to
point a new direction for the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.72 yen to a closing 136.03. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 135.65 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
1.6860 dollars to buy one pound, more than 1.6755 dollars late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8555 West German marks, down from 1.8665; 1.5625
Swiss francs, down from 1.5725; 6.31240 French francs, down from
6.3365; 2.0957 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1050; 1.380.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,388.50; and 1.2338 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2362.
   Gold prices swung in a narrow range in quiet trading, adding to
a growing perception that gold could face weaker prices in the near
future, dealers said.
   The lack of a surge in gold prices despite the recent weakness
of the dollar has contributed to disinterest in gold, dealers said.
   Gold settled in London to a late bid price of $427.50 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Friday's $427.50.
   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid $427.50 per ounce
compared with $428.00 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.54 to close at a bid $429.38.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.50 a troy ounce, compared
with Friday's $6.52.

<TEXT>
   A South Carolina newsprint manufacturer
is planning a joint venture with a Canadian company to build and
manage a $350 million newsprint plant in northeast Venezuela,
officials say.
   Bowater Inc., whose pulp and paper group is headquartered in
Greenville, is working on an agreement with Abitibi-Price Corp. of
Toronto that should be completed this month.
   Bowater and Abitibi-Price each will control 24.25 percent of the
plant, and the Venezuelan government will control the rest, said
Bowater spokesman Arthur King.
   ``This is a project that the Venezuelan government has been
looking at for years,'' King said. ``By making newsprint there,
they can take the wood and power that they have in profusion and
are currently not using, and turn it into another export product _
something besides oil _ which they need desperately for foreign
exchange in Venezuela.''
   The new plant will be in Ciudad Guyana, on the Orinoco River in
northeast Venezuela, which is surrounded by acres of Caribbean
pine, and close to Guri Dam, one of the world's largest generators
of hydroelectric power.
   Plaza said after the one-machine mill begins operating sometime
in 1992, it will produce about 200,000 tons of newsprint per year
and employ about 350 people.
   All but about 40,000 tons of the newsprint will be exported to
customers worldwide, Plaza said, and though Bowater's share will be
nominal, it is expected to significantly boost the company's
exports, which have fallen off in recent years.
   ``They used to be a fairly good-sized exporter, but more
recently they've downsized their export exposure,'' said Mark
Diverio, a pulp and paper analyst who follows Bowater for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The biggest reason for the drop in exports was the 1984 sale of
Bowater Newfoundland Ltd., a wholly owned plant in Canada that
produced much of the company's newsprint for export, Diverio said.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela, faced with falling oil
export revenue, announced Monday one of its banks will open an
office in the gold-mining region of the country to buy gold
directly from miners.
   Finalven plans to open an office in Guayana, some 400 miles
southeast of Caracas, the official news agency Venpress announced.
   The new office would buy gold directly from miners at world
market rates, said Finalven President Arturo Sosa, a former
Treasury Minister.
   Currently Venezuela is pushing to expand its gold production in
the wake of falling oil export revenue.
   Venezuela is supposed to produce 20 thousand pounds of gold this
year, up from 11 thousand in 1987, according to official estimates.
   Experts estimate that much of the mined gold is smuggled out of
the country in search of better rates. Until recently, there was no
centralized system of aquiring the precious metal from the miners,
who work independently in the primitive region near the Brazilian
border.
   The Venezuelan Central Bank opened an office earlier this year
that also purchases gold directly from the miners.

<HEAD>Prices Discussed at Cocoa Producer-Consumer Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 37-nation International Cocoa Organization
Monday began discussing differences over the support price for
cocoa on the first day of crucial talks on the body's future,
delegates said.
   The ``logical consequence of non-agreement'' will be to consider
implementing plans to start winding down the ICCO, said West German
chief delegate Peter Baron.
   These plans, officially unveiled Monday, call for halting on
Oct. 1 the current levy on internationally traded cocoa _ the
ICCO's main source of finance _ as well as for the selling off of
the ICCO's stockpiles to meet running costs during the coming year.
   Delegates said ending the levy would acknowledge that the ICCO
had no further role to play in supporting prices.
   Already the body lacks enough money to implement a possible new
stockpiling scheme because some producers are behind in payments to
the ICCO, delegates said. The ICCO is owed a total of $70 million,
they said.
   Prices on world markets last week reached their lowest levels in
seven years, reflecting a current world cocoa glut and an absence
of ICCO support operations since February, when intervention buying
was indefinitely suspended.
   The proposed new stockpiling scheme, under which producers would
receive ICCO financing to hold back up to 120,000 metric tons of
cocoa from the market, has been blocked by lack of funds and the
dispute between producers and consumers over the support price for
cocoa.
   Consumers say under the provisions of the price pact
administered by the ICCO a cut in the price was automatically
triggered in March, but this interpretation is rejected by the
producers.
   A special panel set up to resolve the dispute reported to the
ICCO today that it was split 3 to 2 on the issue.
   Its independent Belgian chairman, Jean Parotte, backed the view
of the panel's two consumer members while two producer
representatives backed their side's view, delegates said.
   It is now up to the full ICCO to decide the matter and delegates
said the continued polarization of views made a solution appear
very difficult to attain.
   Baron said even if agreement were possible, consumers would then
press for a further cut in the support price to reflect recent
developments on the market.
   Even then the new stockpiling scheme could not operate without
payment of producer debts to the ICCO, consumer delegates said.
   ``The withholding scheme is linked to the arrears,'' said Baron.

   Pernod Ricard SA, the French drinks company, said
Monday it made a friendly takeover offer of 285 million Irish
punts, the equivalent of $412 million, for Irish Distillers Group
PLC to counter a hostile bid by the British liquor group Grand
Metropolitan PLC.
   Pernod claims to have received assurances from 51.8 percent of
the Irish whiskey maker's shareholders to sell their shares to
Pernod, Irish Distillers spokesman Pat Heneghan said.
   Pernod confirmed it had made a 450 pence ($6.50) a share bid,
but declined to comment further before making its official
announcement.
   Trading in shares of Irish Distillers was suspended Monday, at
the company's request, before the official opening of London's
International Stock Market. Shares were suspended at 366 British
pence ($6.17) each, equal to their Friday closing price.
   The suspension followed Grand Metropolitan's announcement late
Sunday that it had raised its takeover bid to 332 million Irish
punts ($480 million) from 253 million punts ($366 million) in
anticipation of Pernod's offer.
   Pernod also said Monday it would challenge the decision of a
British board which regulates mergers and acquisitions to allow
Grand Metropolitan to raise its bid.
   The French company will appeal the decision before Britain's
independent Takeover Panel, whose executive board allowed the
raised bid on Sunday, said Anthony Beevor, director general of the
panel and a member of its executive board.
   In Dublin, Irish Commerce Minister Albert Reynolds said the
takeover situation would also be examined by Ireland's Fair Trades
Commission in terms of its impact on employment, competition and
``the common good.''
   The Dublin-based Irish Distillers said Friday it was holding
talks with Pernod, which has boosted its holding to five percent of
the company's shares from 2.8 percent.
   Pernod has said it would allow Irish Distillers to operate as an
independent component of the Pernod-Ricard group, maintaining the
``integrity of the Irish whiskey industry.''
   The Grand Met bid is worth 525 Irish pence ($7.58) a share, up
from 400 pence ($5.78). Grand Met said Monday it now owns an
8.19-percent stake in Irish Distillers, the largest maker of Irish
whiskey.
   The Irish Distillers' spokesman said Pernod has made an
agreement with FII Fyffes PLC for the 20.04 percent of the shares
it owns.
   Pernod obtained an interim injunction in the Irish High Court
late Sunday preventing Fyffes, an Irish fruit importer, from
selling its shares eleswhere before Wednesday.
   Irish Distillers makes Jameson's, Powers, Paddy and Bushmill's
brands of whiskey.

   If you don't know what ``couch potato,'' ``fat
city'' and ``junk bond'' mean, you can now look them up in the
first new College Edition of Webster's New World Dictionary of the
American Language in 18 years.
   Webster's New World Dictionary is one of the nation's
best-selling reference books and the dictionary of choice of many
of the nation's largest news-gathering organizations.
   The Third College Edition goes on sale Tuesday at $17.95 for
hard cover.
   ``It is an absolutely excellent dictionary,'' said Ken Kister of
Tampa, Fla., a librarian and the author of Dictionary Buying Guide.
``Among all the good desk dictionaries, it is probably the best in
the coverage of Americanisms _ that is, words that originated in
this country.''
   The dictionary defines a couch potato as ``a chronic television
viewer.'' Fat city is ``a place or condition of prosperity,
comfort, success, etc.'' And a junk bond is ``a high-yield
speculative bond often issued to finance the takeover of a
corporation.''
   Those are some of the new terms among 11,000 American words and
phrases and more than 170,000 entries in the dictionary.
   Webster's New World Dictionaries, which has 16 employees in
Cleveland, is owned by Simon & Schuster Inc. of New York.
   Editor in chief Victoria Neufeldt, who joined the company 4{
years ago, said planning for the Third College Edition began in the
mid '70s, and the staff began producing it in 1979.
   The company's two full-time and one part-time readers
continuously read books, newspapers, magazines and signs in search
of new words or new ways of using words.
   References to new words are clipped and placed on index cards
with enough of the surrounding text for editors to be able to
determine how the words were used. Editors refer to the cards when
trying to decide whether a term is common enough to be included in
the dictionary. Words that are no longer used are deleted.
   ``There's so little you can really delete,'' Ms. Neufeldt said.
``There is just so much burgeoning of the vocabulary. And you have
to keep some of the old words'' because they are in books that
remain popular, she said.
   Ms. Neufeldt said the Second College Edition was updated every
two years, but some changes couldn't be made because it would have
involved altering too many pages.
   She said, for example, the third edition uses the word
``Muslim'' instead of ``Moslem'' to describe a follower of Islam.
That change couldn't be made in the second edition updates because
references to ``Moslem'' throughout the dictionary would have had
to be altered, she said.
   The third edition is the first produced by the company using a
computer database, Ms. Neufeldt said.
   Kister said Webster's New World is one of two companies in the
United States that can trace its heritage to Noah Webster, who
wrote dictionaries around the year 1800. The other is Merriam
Webster's of Springfield, Mass., which published the latest edition
of its Collegiate Dictionary in 1983.
   Although sales figures are not available, Kister said Merriam
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary is the nation's best selling
dictionary. As many as 12 million dictionaries are sold each year
