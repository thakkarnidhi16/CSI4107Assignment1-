   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday he hoped a date for a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq
could be set within 10 days, but said this would be only a first
step toward resolving the 8-year-old war.
   In a televised interview, Perez de Cuellar said he wanted a
cease-fire declared ``as soon as possible.'' He is scheduled to
meet Wednesday with the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq in
separate talks on setting up a U.N.-supervised truce.
   ``The ceasefire is not an end in itself. It's the first very
important step. We want a total solution of the problem,'' Perez de
Cuellar said in the interview on PBS's ``The MacNeil-Lehrer News
Hour.''
   Mohammad Ja Afar Mahallati, the Iranian ambassador to the United
Nations, said on the same program that Iraq was continuing to use
chemical warfare against his country, even though Iran has said it
is ready for an immediate suspension of the conflict.
   Ismat Kittani, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, did not deny that his
country had used chemical weapons but added that ``people should
have learned by now not to take allegations by Iran at their face
value.''
   ``We have said, and I can't go beyond that, that we will use
every means available at our disposal to repel this aggression,
this persistent aggression by the Iranians against our country,''
Kittani said.
   ``Nobody should blame us after they have seen how these people
behave,'' he said. ``We want to see genuine signs that Iran is
really coming back to the ranks of civilized countries, and abiding
by the rules.''
   Vernon Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also
appeared on the program and said he sees Iran and Iraq making a
serious effort to end the war.
   ``I think they both made a decision to go for peace. Eight years
is a long time, you get weary. It's unbelievable, eight years, how
they could stand it,'' he said.
   Walters said the war's casualties have taken their toll on both
nations.
   ``It's the flower of their youth. It's their coming generation
that they're going to be losing and I think that's why they have
both come to the conclusion that this is the time to stop that kind
of activity,'' he added.

   A gunman wounded a Belgian diplomat
and killed a woman companion in an apparent robbery attempt at a

   Spokeswoman Marie Louise Vanherk said Benoit Standaert suffered
two gunshot wounds in the incident, which occurred Sunday, and was
in stable condition at a suburban Manila hospital. She said his
companion, Adorata Capistrano, died of her wounds.
   Ms. Vanherk quoted police in nearby Batangas province as saying
they suspected robbery was the motive because the gunman fled with
Ms. Capistrano's purse. The incident occurred at Lake Taal, 35
miles south of Manila, the spokeswoman said.
   The daily newspaper Tempo identified Standaert as the second
secretary of the Belgian Embassy in Manila. Newspapers earlier had
reported the shooting took place Monday.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has been escorting
Kuwaiti oil through the Persian Gulf for about as long as the
United States has, but its secretive, low-key operation has
attracted far less notice.
   While criticizing Washington for escalating tensions in the
region and calling for a U.N.-sponsored force to replace foreign
navies in the gulf, the Soviets have maintained their own flotilla
in the waterway since late 1986.
   Five European countries _ Britain, France, Italy, Belgium and
the Netherlands _ also have kept warships in the gulf in the past
year. All of these forces, along with those of the United States,
are expected to be reduced or removed if a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire takes hold.
   There are usually about 25 to 30 foreign warships in the
strategic gulf, most of them American. The total in the region is
around 60, including France's sizable Indian Ocean fleet, based at
Djibouti.
   The exact number of Soviet vessels in the gulf and nearby waters
is difficult to pin down, but U.S. officials say it has hovered at
about seven to nine for the past year.
   The force normally includes two destroyers, plus oceangoing mine
sweepers, tugboats and supply vessels.
   The Soviet convoys, with one or two warships escorting small
groups of cargo vessels flying the flags of the Soviet Union and
other East Bloc countries, are often seen in the gulf.
   Their convoys sail without the air cover available to the U.S.
warships that escort U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, and their radio
traffic is limited to routine exchanges and greetings with the
warships of other nations.
   The only known example of direct cooperation between the U.S.
and Soviet forces occurred Jan. 5, when a Soviet minehunter advised
a U.S. cruiser in the gulf that it had found a mine, and U.S.
helicopters took part in a search for others. The mine eventually
was destroyed by the Soviets, U.S. officials say.
   Moscow's naval operations are run from a coastal anchorage near
the United Arab Emirates port of Khor Fakkhan, in the Gulf of Oman,
close to the staging area for the U.S. Navy's Kuwaiti tanker
convoys.
   The Soviets have long maintained a naval base at Socotra island
off the Horn of Africa that is owned by South Yemen, the Arab
world's only Marxist state. After the Iraq-Iran war broke out in
September 1980, they posted one or two warships outside the Strait
of Hormuz, gateway to the gulf.
   The deployment of Soviet warships to the gulf was never
announced but became apparent when two destroyers turned up in the
waterway shortly after Iranian gunboats intercepted two Soviet
cargo ships in September 1986.
   In early 1987, Moscow agreed to lease three Soviet tankers to
Kuwait and provide them with armed escort.
   The move, seen by some U.S. officials as part of efforts by
Moscow to expand its influence in the oil-rich region, spurred the
Reagan administration's decision to reflag 11 Kuwait-owned tankers
with the Stars and Stripes.
   One of the Soviet tankers, the 67,9870-ton Marshal Chuikov, hit
a mine off Kuwait on May 16, 1987. The incident was quickly
obscured the next day when the frigate USS Stark was blasted by
errant Iraqi missiles, killing 37 sailors.
   Except for the Marshal Chuikov mining and a few reports of
Soviet warships finding mines, U.S. officials say they are not
aware of any incidents involving the Soviet forces in the past 1{
years.
   ``The Iranians probably know that if they ever tried to
interfere with a Soviet tanker, they'd be blown to bits and nothing
would ever be explained one way or another,'' a U.S. Navy officer
said several months ago.
   The Soviets' gulf force consists of destroyers, of the 7,900-ton
Sovremenny class or the 8,000-ton Udaloy class, and Natya or Yurka
class mine sweepers. Foreign naval sources have said the ships are
difficult to identify because the Soviets change hull numbers
periodically.

attempt in a box 20 yards above one of Sydney's busiest
thoroughfares.
   The Sydney man said a masseur and an electric nerve stimulator
helped him keep alert during the marathon stint.
   Woods, who was filmed by an Australian television show that
concentrates of wierd and wacky achievements, said after the
weeklong marathon effort that television programs ``really aren't

   The Guinness Book of Records does not list a current record for
television watching.

<HEAD>More States Lowered Taxes Than Increased Them in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More states decreased taxes than raised them
this year, and the total increase among the 27 states was an
unusually low $600 million, according to the National Conference of
Legislatures.
   The organization, in a survey of state tax policies, said 13
states raised taxes and 14 lowered them, with most revisions
relatively minor.
   Traditionally, a tax change is considered ``large'' only if it
results in at least a 5 percent increase or decrease in revenue. By
this standard, the only ``large'' increases this year were reported
in Arizona and Louisiana, and the only ``large'' decreases came in
South Dakota and Utah, according to the conference.
   The survey is part of a broader report to be released this week
at the conference's annual meeting in Reno, Nev.
   ``To a considerable extent, 1988 tax actions are related to the
tax policy followed last year,'' the conference said. ``The large
number of tax increases last year helped to improve financial
conditions and thereby avoided the need to increase taxes this
year.''
   The organization also said the $600 million tax increase this
year is smaller than those in most recent years.
   In 1985, the survey said, there was a tax reduction of $1.3
billion. All other years since 1981 had tax increases of at least
$1.1 billion, which came in 1986. The next smallest increase in
this decade was a $2.3 billion rise in 1984.
   State tax collections exceed $260 billion per year, according to
the conference.
   The survey said income taxes were reduced in 10 states and
increased in two; motor fuel taxes were hiked in nine states; and
sales taxes _ either through a higher rate or broader base _ went
up in five states while being lowered in three others.
   The most significant tax increases this year came in Arizona,
Louisiana and West Virginia, although they were spared major tax
hikes in 1987. Citizens in Utah, South Dakota and Kansas saw the
biggest tax reductions after seeing taxes increase in 1987.
   Arizona and Massachusetts were the only two states to increase
income taxes. Arizona also hiked a number of other taxes including
property and motor fuel taxes.
   Louisiana and West Virginia were the only states to increase
their sales taxes significantly. Louisiana's sales tax went up 2
cents on food, utilities and drugs; and West Virginia's rate jumped
1 cent for a 13-month period.
   While the most frequent tax changes involved motor fuel, sales
or income taxes, some states found other sources of revenue.
   Iowa and Rhode Island increased their cigarette tax, joining 11
states that did the same in 1987, and Massachusetts for the first
time imposed such a tax.
   A recent trend of taxing mail order sales continued this year,
with Tennessee joining 11 other states in enacting such a tax,
which still faces court tests.
   Arizona and parts of Washington state increased taxes on
hotel-motel rooms. Washington also increased its tax on hazardous
waste while lowering a tax on aluminum casting. The property
transfer tax increased in Vermont and insurance premium taxes were
lowered in Florida and Minnesota.

   Planned truce talks between youth gang
leaders did little to slow weekend bloodshed on inner-city streets
as a wave of violent conflicts left four people dead and 10 others
injured.
   The weekend violence erupted in the wake of announced plans by
city church leaders to stage a truce summit this week between
members of the city's major black street gang factions.
   Alfredo Guillen, 34, was critically wounded when an unknown
assailant wearing gang-style clothing approached on foot outside a
bar and shot him in the head after a brief argument, said Detective
John Bunch.
   A brawl Saturday night between about 30 gang rivals in a Boyle
Heights alley left a 17-year-old admitted gang member nursing a
minor stab wound at County-USC Medical Center, said police Sgt.
Dave Lewis.
   Police also were investigating the discovery of a man's body on
the street in gang-ridden south-central Los Angeles after a
shooting Sunday afternoon.
   Another man was wounded by gunfire Sunday in what he initially
told police was a drive-by attack, Officer Jesse Williams said.
Derek Grant, 22, of Los Angeles later revealed he apparently was
shot in self-defense by his landlord following an argument and
fistfight, Williams said.
   Earlier, Louis Canales, 18, of Maywood, died after being shot
with a .357-caliber Magnum pistol following a confrontation between
rival gangs, said county sheriff's Deputy Dan Cox.
   A 15-year-old Cudahy youth, whose name was withheld, was in
custody for investigation of the fatal shooting, Cox said.
   A shouting match with gang members escalated into gunfire that
killed Larry Marcus, 18, of Palmdale, who was fatally shot in a
shopping center parking lot early Saturday morning, said police
Detective William Humphry.
   Robert Mora, also 18, of Los Angeles, was struck by a single
bullet in the attack, and was listed in stable condition at a UCLA
Medical Center, Humphry said.
   The alleged gunmen, known to police as active gang members,
evaded capture, the detective said.
   And in Atwater, Benjamin Rivas, 17, was killed by shotgun blasts
from assailants who yelled gang slogans from a moving car before
opening fire late Friday, said police Lt. Dave Waterman.
   Five teen-agers were wounded in another apparent gang attack,
and an unidentified 17-year-old was hit by gunfire late Friday as
he walked on the street with friends, police said.

<TEXT>
   The drought that has forced Okefenokee
Swamp's wildlife to gather near deeper pools and its alligators to
engage in cannibalism, is necessary for the survival of the swamp,
a parks official says.
   ``The swamp has tolerated drought for thousands of years.
Drought is a part of the biological process that creates open water
areas and marsh areas,'' said John Schroer, manager of the
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
   Swamp vegetation dries out during a drought, increasing the
chance of wildfire ignited by lightning. But, Schroer said,
wildfires are necessary because they burn off floating islands of
peat, which eventually can turn into dry land. Indians dubbed the
swamp ``the land of the trembling earth'' because of the undulating
peat.
   In 1954 and 1955, fires raged for 12 months, burning 80 percent
of the swamp, and fires in the 1840s created some of the
Okefenokee's lakes by burning large holes in the peat.
   ``If it weren't for the natural wildfires that have occurred
throughout history, the swamp would not be a swamp,'' said Schroer.
``It would be a forest.''
   The peat floats to the surface of the swamp's reflective
tea-colored water, forming islands that support vegetation.
Eventually trees begin growing in the peat, sinking their roots
into the swamp's sandy bottom. The islands get larger and larger,
and without fires, they could be transformed into forests.
   The 700-square-mile swamp in southeastern Georgia and
northeastern Florida is home to many types of animals, including
rare birds, fish, poisonous snakes and alligators. Many exotic
plants also thrive, including orchids, lilies, cypress trees and
carnivorous pitcher plants. President Franklin D. Roosevelt
designated most of the swamp a national wildlife refuge in 1937.
   The drought has caused wildlife to congregate near water holes,
Schroer said. Game officials recently counted nearly 1,000
alligators along a 5-mile spillway on the swamp's western side.
   ``When they get concentrated, predators have more prey,'' he
said. ``Alligators start eating other alligators. We've seen some
cannibalistic activity, but this is nature's way of keeping
populations in check. The big males typically try to keep other
males out of their territory.''
   Schroer said water levels are 8 to 10 inches below normal on the
east side of the swamp, near the Suwannee Canal. Levels are about a
foot below normal near the 80-acre Stephen C. Foster State Park on
the swamp's western edge near Fargo. And the water is 5 to 6 feet
below normal near the spillway.
   Visitors can still take two-day canoe trips into the swamp from
the Suwannee Canal, but the longer trips of up to five days have
been canceled because boats have trouble navigating some of the
shallow trails, Schroer said.
   Barbara Metts, assistant superintendent at Georgia's Foster
State Park, said anglers can still reach Billy's Lake, a popular
fishing spot, but canoe trails to Minnie's and Big Water lakes are
closed because of low water.
   Jimmy Walker, general manager of the privately run Okefenokee
Swamp Park near Waycross, said his park continues to offer 4-mile
boat tours but has discontinued 10-mile tours deeper into the swamp
to avoid damaging boat motors in the shallow water.
   ``The water is low, but it's not critically low like it was two
years ago,'' he said.
   During the 1986 drought, Walker had to cancel all boat tours and
was able to walk along trails that normally carried boatloads of
visitors.
   Ms. Metts said she went fishing recently with her mother, and
the woman's brightly colored bobber attracted an 8-foot alligator.
   ``The gators are plentiful and they love to visit the
fishermen,'' she said. ``One of the gators fell in love with her
bobber. Needless to say, we didn't catch anything.''

   About 20 railroad cars derailed
Sunday, dumping a chemical that can kill fish into a creek,
authorities said.
   About 20,550 gallons of a petroleum refinery waste product
drained from an overturned tanker, said Millie McGuigan, operations
officer for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. It was not
known how much of the substance actually went into Indian Camp
Creek, which eventually flows to the Harpeth River, Ms. McGuigan
said.
   There were no injuries and no evacuations, and the spill should
not threaten any drinking water supplies because of purification,
she said.
   But she added, ``It is harmful to aquatic life. When it gets in
the water it takes out oxygen.''
   The CSX Transportation rail cars were expected to be righted
Monday, she said.
   Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
Dickson County sheriff's department and the Public Services
Commission were investigating, but the cause of the derailment was
unknown, Ms. McGuigan said.

   Honky-tonk singer Keith Whitley credits
a hit record for saving his life.
   ``I have no doubts in my mind that I would not be sitting here
today had it not been for `Miami My Amy.' That song saved my
life,'' Whitley said. The country tune he wrote and recorded in
1986 made the top-10 and helped him break his heavy drinking.
   ``It gave me confidence; it gave me work,'' said Whitley, whose
single, ``Don't Close Your Eyes,'' topped the country charts this
month.
   Whitley, 33, began playing the guitar at age 6, and was on a
West Virginia radio station within three years. At 15, he toured
with country singer Ricky Skaggs and bluegrass great Ralph
Stanley's Clinch Mountain Boys band.

   Actor Terence Knox, who appears in the
CBS-TV's Vietnam War series ``Tour of Duty,'' is concerned the
show's authentic look could be lost when its filming moves from
Hawaii to Southern California.
   ``One of the great things about the show was that it looked so
right,'' Knox said recently. ``Hawaii was a good substitute for
Nam. And I don't want to lose that.''
   Knox, 37, said he recently learned the show will begin shooting
in the Los Angeles area next season. It had been on permanent
location in Hawaii.
   ``It may just be that there's jungle up in Saugus (near Los
Angeles) that could pass for Vietnam,'' Knox said. ``But I don't
know of any.''
   ``Tour of Duty'' is about a platoon of combat soldiers in
Vietnam, and Knox, who plays the tough Army Sgt. Zeke Anderson,
says the response from veterans has been positive.
   ``I figure that if we keep our truth and integrity, and see that
what the guys went through over there isn't mutilated, there's no
problem.''

   David Stewart, who walked 1,500 miles in
three months to publicize his dream of appearing in the Grand Ole
Opry, finally had his moment in the spotlight _ six of them, in
fact.
   Stewart took center stage Saturday night and sang his song, ``In
the Wings of the Grand Ole Opry.''
   ``I'm just proud to be here. I want to thank you folks for
taking part in this trip with me. This has been my dream,'' Stewart
told the crowd.
   Stewart, 37, got a rousing ovation after his six-minute fling
with fame. Opry announcer Charlie Douglas invited Stewart to
perform an encore, ``Jambalaya,'' with veteran Hank Snow.
   Stewart was invited Friday to appear on the Opry cable
television show. The offer came a few hours after he completed the
walk from his home in Gillette, Wyo., to Nashville to show how much
he wanted to perform on the 63-year-old Opry.

   A practice space shuttle countdown
was under way here today in a test leading to a firing of
Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad Saturday.
   The launch team started the count at 11:33 p.m. Sunday. On
Wednesday, it planned to load more than a half million gallons of
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the shuttle's
external fuel tank.
   It will be the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the
Challenger explosion, which killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28,
1986.
   When the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock lift-off on
Wednesday, a problem will be simulated to force a launch
postponement. Then launch crews will rehearse what's called a
72-hour turnaround.
   They will empty the fuel tank, start another countdown, refill
the tank and aim for a 20-second test firing of Discovery's main
engines at 7:30 a.m. Saturday.
   The firing, with the shuttle bolted firmly on the pad, will
check modifications made to the engines and is considered critical
to Discovery being certified for the first post-Challenger shuttle
flight.
   The launch, with a five-man crew, is scheduled for early
September, but the date is in doubt as engineers continue to puzzle
over how to fix a small gas leak in a steering engine system that
is separate from the main engines.
   They hope to make the repair on the pad and avoid rolling
Discovery back to a hangar, a move that could delay the flight as
much as two months.
   Experts are considering several ways to reach the inaccessible
leak, including cutting a hole through the shuttle's cargo bay wall
and running a snake-like tube through the gas line in an effort to
plug it.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it will
not make a decision on whether to move Discovery off the pad until
after the main engine test firing.

<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp.'s chairman was
delighted that a national magazine named Danbury America's best
place to live, but another resident says she was stunned because
she finds the city boring.
   In its second-annual rating of 300 U.S. areas, Money magazine's
current issue ranked the Danbury metropolitan area as the most
livable
   Danbury, about 60 miles northeast of New York City in
southwestern Connecticut, once was known as the ``hat city''
because hatters plied their trade here starting before the American
Revolution. The last hat factory closed in 1987.
   Today, the city of about 70,000 people is the home of Union
Carbide, Danbury's largest employer.
   ``We are very happy here,'' said Robert D. Kennedy, chairman and
chief executive officer of the giant chemical company. And the
company, which moved its headquarters from New York City to an
innovative suburban complex in 1980-81, is here to stay, he added.
   ``There's no better place to be. We came at a time when the city
of Danbury was beginning the sort of comeback they've since
enjoyed,'' Kennedy said.
   But a shopper on Main Street said she was surprised about the
honor.
   ``I don't know why,'' said the woman, who identified herself
only as Barbara. ``It's boring. When we want to do something, we go
into the (New York) city.'' She said she hopes to move soon.
   Money magazine said Danbury unseated last year's No. 1 area,
Nashua, N.H., because of a lower crime rate, slightly better
schools and its proximity to New York.
   John Everett, an aide to Nashua Mayor John Donchess, said the
mayor, who was unavailable for comment, would not be upset about
losing the top spot because Nashua remained in the top 10.
   Everett said last year's top ranking gave the city more exposure.
   ``I'd go somewhere and say I'm from Nashua, New Hampshire, and
people would say they'd heard of it,'' he said. ``The old saying
used to be you go to Nashua on the way to somewhere else.''
   The magazine said its staffers studied government and private
data on the 300 largest metropolitan areas, ranking their crime
rates, housing, health care, economy, arts, education, transit
system, weather and leisure activities.
   Danbury Mayor Joseph H. Sauer Jr. said he was ``very proud.''
   ``I'm not naive to think this took place in the last eight
months,'' said Sauer, who became mayor in November. ``The reasons
are the objects of our concentrated efforts _ low crime rate,
medical facilities, parks and recreation _ we've worked on all of
it.''
   Sauer and Money magazine acknowledged that Danbury has its
problems. For example, a three-bedroom house typically costs
between $175,000 and $250,000.
   Danbury has had other troubles. The administration of former
Mayor James E. Dyer is the target of an FBI probe that resulted in
the confiscation of city expense and payroll records last year. And
a former part-time probate judge and Danbury lawyer allegedly
embezzled more than $3 million from trust funds under his care
before committing suicide last year.
   But many business owners who have worked and lived here their
entire lives wouldn't live anywhere else.
   Mary G. Cappiello, who runs a card shop on Main Street, said she
and her seven siblings were born in Danbury. Today, her 15 nieces
and nephews all live and work here.
   ``I would say it is (the best place to live),'' she said. ``I
think we have a lot going for us.''
   Her brother, Frank J. Cappiello, who runs a jewelry shop down
the street, said he was a little surprised by the top ranking.
   ``Palm Springs has got to be a better place,'' he said.

<HEAD>German Politicians Reported Angered By New Italian Speed Limits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some West German politicians are
calling lowered speed limits on Italian highways downright
inhospitable, saying they appear aimed at catching unsuspecting
German vacationers unawares.
   ``The purpose of this law is apparently to take money from
vacationers,'' the mass-circulation newspaper Bild quoted federal
lawmaker Ernt Hinken as saying.
   ``Many Germans will be caught without knowing the law has been
changed,'' Hinken, a federal lawmaker for the governing Christian
Democrats, reportedly told the paper.
   Under new rules that took effect on Sunday, the maximum speed
permitted on Italy's superhighways has been lowered to 110
kilometers per hour (68 mph) from 140 kilometers per hour (87 mph).
The maximum speed on Italy's regular highways fell to 90 from 110
kilometers per hour.
   Italian authorities said the speed limits were lowered because
of an increase in highway deaths.
   Thousands of West Germans are now taking to the road _ many of
them en route to Italy and other southern points _ to start their
summer vacations.
   There are no maximum speed limits on some sections of West
Germany's autobahns.
   Erwin Huber, a high-ranking politician with the Christian Social
Union, the CDU's Bavarian sister party, also criticized the lowered
Italian speed limits.
   ``Italy is a much-beloved vacationland with a reputation for
hospitality. But I do not think these measures are hospitable,''
Bild quoted him as saying.
   Bild's report, appearing it today's editions, was telexed to
other news organizations in advance.

   A big Wyoming forest fire edged into Yellowstone National Park
on Sunday but appeared to be slowing down, and firefighters fought
to keep a separate fire inside the park from burning into Idaho.
   The south entrance to Yellowstone, along with the Grant Village
hotel and two campgrounds, remained closed Sunday because of other
fires in the park, but officials stressed that all major park
attractions remained open.
   Two fires that burned together over some 10,800 acres in
California's Gold Rush country were contained Saturday and 80
percent controlled Sunday, officials said. A fire is considered
contained when a fire break is built around it, and controlled when
it is reduced to smoldering patches.
   Hot, dry weather remained a factor as hundreds of acres of trees
and brush also burned Sunday in smaller fires in parts of
Washington, Oregon, Montana, Colorado and Utah.
   Despite temperatures that reached 94 degrees on the fire lines,
about 210 firefighters Sunday afternoon brought a 2,420-acre blaze
on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington under control, said
Norm Anderson, a Wenatchee National Forest official.
   The 22,650-acre Mink Creek fire in the Bridger-Teton National
Forest's Teton Wilderness grew by only 150 acres overnight but it
crossed the boundary of Yellowstone into a rugged backcountry area,
Dave Steinke, a fire information officer said Sunday.
   ``It pushed past Falcon Creek last night and moved just slightly
into the park, probably one-quarter of a mile,'' he said. ``We have
a few spots in the Yellowstone Meadows area. But we have a crew up
there mopping that up and it looks pretty good on the north end.''
   A lack of wind during the night helped the fire stay within
containment lines on its southern end, where it was within a few
miles of private property.
   ``We think it's calmed down,'' Steinke said. He said 737
firefighters were strengthening firebreaks and mopping up hot spots.
   ``We made very good progress (Saturday), and one reason was that
we didn't get the predicted adverse weather,'' said Dale Jarrell,
incident commander. ``Also, the crews are doing an outstanding
job.''
   On the western side of Yellowstone, a 1,300-acre blaze
threatening grizzly bear habitat in the park more than doubled in
size by nightfall Sunday, sending a column of smoke more than seven
miles into the air, authorities said.
   John Quackenbush, a helicopter pilot helping dump water on the
fire, said it was one of the biggest columns of smoke he had seen
in 14 years of such work.
   Forest Service spokesman Bruce Fox said earlier that 200
firefighters, assisted by nine fire engines, a helicopter and two
bulldozers, withdrew to construct a fire line running roughly
adjacent to the park's boundary to keep the North Fork fire from
crossing into the Targhee National Forest in eastern Idaho.
   ``Basically, we've decided to allow nature to take its course,''
he said.
   The blaze began Friday about a quarter mile inside the Targhee,
and then spread eastward into Yellowstone six miles south of the
point where the Idaho, Montana and Wyoming borders meet.
   Elsewhere in southern Idaho, in the Sawtooth National Forest
southeast of Twin Falls, the Poison Creek fire was about 40 percent
contained at more than 2,000 acres, authorities said.
   The fire was threatening a cutthroat and rainbow trout fishery
along with valuable deer habitat and recently transplanted bighorn
sheep and wild turkeys.
   In California, firefighters fought shifting wind, high
temperatures and a threat of lightning Sunday in an effort to
extinquish twin blazes in Calaveras County that caused $11 million
in damages. Fire crews hoped to put them out by Monday night.
   ``We're holding our breath, waiting to find out what the
weather's going to do to us,'' said Barbara Dashiell, a spokeswoman
for the California Department of Forestry in the Mother Lode
community of Rail Road Flat, 150 miles east of San Francisco.
   Six homes, nine other buildings and eight vehicles have been
lost since the arson-suspected blazes broke out Tuesday. There were
1,700 firefighters and support personnel on hand Sunday, down from
a maximum of 3,400 Friday.
   In Montana, 160 firefighters worked to contain a 250-acre blaze
in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness that threatened to spread into
an area filled with dead and dying trees, said Deanna Riede, a
Forest Service spokeswoman in Missoula.
   At least 120 firefighters battled summer heat and wind at a
blaze that scorched more than 250 acres of brush and timber near
Flaming Gorge Dam on the Utah-Colorado border, Ashley National
Forest spokeswoman Merle Young said.
   ``It's still an uncontrolled fire,'' Young said. No injuries or
property damage were reported from the blaze, which is believed to
have been ignited by fireworks.

   Director Steven Spielberg's
multimillion-dollar home was damaged Sunday in a fire that spread
to another oceanfront estate, authorities said.
   Spielberg, his actress-wife Amy Irving and their son, Max,
weren't home at the time of the blaze and there were no injuries,
authorities said.
   Arson investigators were dispatched to help determine the fire's
cause, Deputy Eric Smith of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department said. Smith confirmed that Spielberg's home was involved.
   It took 40 firefighters about 40 minutes to extinguish the
blaze, authorities said.
   ``The first home (Spielberg's) was fully involved when we
arrived, then the second home caught fire,'' said county fire Capt.
Derek Reyna.
   Damage to the Spielberg home was estimated at $210,000, and the
neighboring residence sustained $120,000 in damage, said Reyna.
   Firefighters arrived at 6:41 p.m. and the fire was out by 7:18
p.m., Reyna said. He didn't know the name of the other homeowner.
   Other residents of the exclusive Broad Beach celebrity enclave
include Sylvester Stallone, Robert Redford, Carroll O'Connor and
Goldie Hawn. The homes generally are valued at $3 million to $10
million.
   Among Spielberg's hit films were ``Jaws,'' ``Close Encounters of
the Third Kind,'' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' ``E.T. _ The
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Empire of the Sun,'' ``The Color Purple''
and the recently released ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Child-Care Program, Starts Considering Running Mates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, after outlining a $2.2
billion child-care program designed to help close his gender gap
with women, is turning his attention to selecting a running mate.
   The vice president says he expects to have ``some kind of a
list'' of potential running mates prepared by sometime this week,
although he hopes to delay announcing his choice until the GOP
convention next month.
   The certain Republican presidential candidate was expected to
spend much of this week mulling over his vice presidential
selection and had few campaign events scheduled.
   Meanwhile, Bush was drawing mixed reviews for his proposal for
child-care tax credits of up to $1,000 per child for low-income
families. For the neediest families _ those earning less than
$10,000 a year _ the ``credit'' would become a direct government
payment of the maximum $1,000 for each child of four or younger.
   Bush made the proposal Sunday in a speech to the National
Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs in
Albuquerque, N.M., ending a five-day burst of campaigning in seven
states.
   ``It was a gutsy move on the part of the vice president,'' said
Deborah Steelman, domestic affairs director for Bush's presidential
campaign.
   The vice president's plan was a sharp departure from the Reagan
administration's past policies on child care, and bears a price tag
similar to a $2.5 billion Democratic plan now before Congress.
   The Democratic proposal chiefly sponsored by Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., which Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis has endorsed ``in concept,'' would provide the money to
child-care providers instead of to individual families as under the
Bush plan.
   Betty Wray, president of the federation to which Bush spoke,
called the plan ``one of the first concrete gestures that the vice
president has made'' on issues concerning women.
   But, she added, ``We know that George Bush has a problem right
now with women voters in this country. So until the Republican
party starts to very seriously take a look at those kinds of things
that are making a difference, it could pose real problems. ...
   ``There are simply not enough Republican men to get him (Bush)
elected without the woman's vote,'' she said.
   At the conclusion of his speech, many members of the audience of
2,500 women chanted ``E-R-A'' over and over, for the equal rights
amendment which Bush opposes and which he did not mention in his
talk.
   ``We would have liked to have him address the equal rights
amendment, which continues to be this organization's top
priority,'' federation president-elect Betty Forbes said. The
organization's leaders said Dukakis and Bentsen also had been
invited to address the convention, but had conflicting plans.
   There would be no strings attached to how the proposed Bush tax
credit-payment could be spent. To qualify, at least one adult
family member would have to be employed.
   Bush arrived in Albuquerque on Sunday on Air Force Two with
former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, a
frequently mentioned vice presidential possibility whose speech to
the group followed the vice president's.
   Mrs. Dole, wife of former GOP rival, Senate Republican leader
Bob Dole of Kansas, helped worked on the final draft of Bush's
speech, according to her aides.
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said there was no discussion of the
vice presidential selection process on the plane.
   The vice president told reporters that screening of potential
running mates _ to look into backgrounds and financial histories _
would begin this week. Prospective candidates will be asked to fill
out financial disclosure statements, he indicated.
   ``So by sometime next week, there will have to be some kind of a
list,'' he said.
   Bush told his Albuquerque audience his ``Children's Tax Credit''
would range up to $1,000 per child under age 4 and would be
``refundable'' _ meaning families could receive something from the
government even if they didn't earn enough to pay taxes.
   The vice president said the credit would be phased out as income
rises. He gave no details on exactly how this would be done.
   Background information provided by Bush's staff said the tax
credit would cost $1.5 billion a year.
   Bush's four-point program also included:
   _Expansion of the existing child-care tax credit to cover more
low-income families, for a cost of $400 million a year.
   _Creation of workplace child-care centers for all government
employees and a federally underwritten liability insurance program
for private centers, $50 million a year.
   _More federal assistance to help states and local governments
set up programs such as sick child care and before-and-after school
care, $250 million.

<HEAD>White House Sidesteps Questions About Baker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan returned from a midsummer's
vacation amid heightened expectations that Treasury Secretary James
A. Baker III will resign soon to run George Bush's presidential
campaign.
   Neither Baker nor White House officials would confirm publicly
that Baker will be leaving the Cabinet soon, although presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater did not flatly deny it.
   Given the opportunity Sunday to say Baker would not leave the
treasury post, Fitzwater said only: ``He's still treasury
secretary. Put it that way.''
   But an administration official, declining to be named publicly,
said Baker's resignation likely will be submitted to Reagan in
early August, possibly as soon as next Monday, with plans to hook
up with Bush in mid-August.
   A Baker move to the Bush campaign would not be shocking since
there has been speculation for months that the longtime Bush
confidant eventually would move from the Treasury Department to the
campaign. Baker managed Bush's unsuccessful run for the GOP
presidential nomination in 1980.
   Baker accompanied Reagan and his wife, Nancy, on the flight from
California to Washington on Sunday, although the treasury secretary
was not observed boarding the plane with the Reagans at Point Mugu
Naval Air Station.
   Baker evidently had boarded before the contingent of reporters
arrived to greet the Reagans, who had flown to the military base
from their ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains.
   The secretary also spurned a request by a pool of reporters on
Air Force One to come chat with them. Instead, he sent back a
folder that contained a dollar bill. Baker wrote, ``Please note the
title under the signature is secretary of the treasury.''
   Fitzwater said only that Reagan and Baker, who had been the
president's chief of staff from 1981-85, merely had a ``very brief
chat.''
   An official who discussed the situation on grounds of anonymity
said the secretary had spoken at a fund-raiser Saturday night for
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and ``essentially, he is hitching a
ride.''
   But another official said Baker would not have needed to inform
Reagan of his plans on the Air Force One trip, saying the
secretary's decision to take over the vice president's campaign had
been known for some time.
   When Baker got off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base just
outside Washington, a reporter asked the secretary, ``Can you share
the news with us?''
   Baker replied, ``There's no news to share.''
   Asked if he had spoken with Reagan about quitting, Baker said he
had not.
   Baker has been an unofficial adviser to the Bush campaign for
some time, and had accompanied the vice president to Wyoming last
week for a fishing trip.
   If Baker were to leave, it would be the second major Cabinet
change in recent weeks. Attorney General Edwin Meese III, a
longtime Reagan friend, has resigned effective late this month or
early next month. Reagan nominated former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard
Thornburgh as Meese's replacement.
   While Reagan vacationed last week at his ranch near Santa
Barbara, Calif., senior aides discussed the administration's agenda
for the remainder of the president's term.
   This week Reagan will assess the prospects for new U.S. military
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels _ a subject that is on the agenda for
a Tuesday morning meeting with Republican congressional leaders.
   He also plays host Wednesday to Hungarian Premier Karoly Grosz
in the first such visit by a high-ranking Hungarian official since
the country came under communist rule 40 years ago.
   Since becoming premier in June 1987, Grosz has sought improved
economic and political ties with the West. Grosz began an 11-day
U.S. tour last week.
   Reagan will receive an updated report on the drought from
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, who took a 10-state tour
last week. The administration's midyear budget review also is due
this week.

   As the American people try to figure out
whether to put Mike Dukakis in the White House, the candidate
reveals that his daydreams about 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue leave him
with a perplexing question:
   Where do you put the tomato garden?
   ``I'm trying to figure it out _ wherever there's full sun,
right?'' he told reporters traveling with him over the weekend.
   The Massachusetts governor says he grows three varieties of
tomatoes in his back yard in Boston, along with some cucumbers and
peppers. He says he worries about them when he's on the campaign
trail, although his neighbor is watering them.
   Maybe it was the swing through California and North Dakota farm
areas that got him thinking about moving that vegetable garden to
Washington.
   It wouldn't be good to cut down any of the famous White House
trees. And don't worry about the Rose Garden. No point planting
there, he says, because it's too close to the building.
   ``A good tomato garden with cukes, peppers, has got to be right
out there'' in the open, ``Right?''

   Dukakis is mindful that keeping ahead in the polls sometimes
requires placing things on your head.
   On his first post-convention campaign swing last weekend he
posed for pictures with a Scottish tam-o'-shanter and an Assyrian
headpiece and some baseball caps. No doubt, before campaign's end
he'll be donning an American Indian headdress, a cowboy had, hard
hat and others.
   Although he's not usually a hat man, he was taking it all in
stride until, at a rally in Erie, Pa., Mayor Lou Tullio showed up
with the special hat he built for the Democratic convention.
   The boater had a stuffed animal attached to the top holding up a
torch, sort of like a furry statue of liberty. It was the kind of
hat usually worn only at political conventions (last week's
featured such beauties as Wisconsin's cheese hats). But Tullio has
been ailing and couldn't make it to Atlanta. So he obviously
figured that having the party's new nominee in town was a great
time to show it off.
   But when he brought it out on the stage, Dukakis made no move to
touch it, looking at it as if the furry thing might bite. Finally,
Tullio balanced it on his own head, the crowd cheered with
approval, and Dukakis smiled.

   One of the most exciting moments for reporters covering the
Dukakis campaign swing came Friday when the press plane, landing in
Houston, slammed into the runway, bounced up, and then several
seconds later landed again.
   The Secret Service, which had several of its agents on the
plane, called for an inspection and on Saturday it appeared the
plane would be pulled out of service. However, repairs were
completed on time and the press plane continued to follow Dukakis
and running mate Lloyd Bentsen to Minot, N.D., St. Louis, and Erie,
Pa.
   After Erie, Bentsen and wife B.A. boarded the press charter
flight back to Washington, instead of continuing to Boston with
Dukakis.
   ``I've heard about this plane,'' Mrs. Bentsen said.
   ``I didn't want to get on this one until we tested it with you
guys,'' the senator quipped.
   Meanwhile, as the campaign moves into full swing, there are
tentative plans for Bentsen to take over Dukakis' Boeing 737 and
for the governor to charter a larger plane.
   Bentsen will be inheriting a plane that once was Republican Bob
Dole's campaign jet. Dukakis had the Presidential Airways plane's
exterior spruced up and its interior redone with a little office up
front separated by a curtain from the press and federal agents in
the back.

   Americans overwhelmingly favor maintaining or
increasing the federal budget for space exploration, even while
three in 10 doubt NASA's competence, a Media General-Associated
Press poll has found.
   The national survey of 1,223 adults found that nearly half those
questioned lost confidence in the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration after the space shuttle Challenger exploded in
January 1986, and 60 percent of those, or 28 percent of all
questioned, say they still lack faith in the agency.
   However, 40 percent of the respondents said the United States
was doing too little in space exploration, and majorities supported
the initiatives of building a space station and sending manned
flights to Mars.
   The space shuttle program also won support, with 40 percent
saying it should be expanded and as many saying it should be
maintained. The first shuttle flight since the Challenger disaster
is scheduled for September, although a leak in a gas line is
threatening to delay it.
   NASA was rated positively overall. Fifty-five percent said the
agency has done a good or excellent job, while 37 percent rated it
only fair or poor.
   Only 18 percent said the space budget should be decreased, while
almost half said NASA's budget should remain the same and 30
percent said it should be increased. Of those who favored an
increase, 74 percent said they would be willing to pay higher taxes
to accomplish it.
   The Senate this month approved $200 million for NASA's space
station program, only enough to phase it out or put it on hold. The
House approved $700 million, and a joint committee is to resolve
the issue.
   Fear of falling behind in space may be one reason for the
public's support for NASA's funding. Just 23 percent of respondents
said the United States is ahead of the Soviet Union in space
exploration, while the remainder were split on whether the Soviets
are ahead or the two countries are about even.
   In any case, a plurality of respondents favored superpower
cooperation in space: 49 percent favored last month's proposal by
the Soviets for a U.S.-Soviet joint effort to send astronauts to
Mars.
   Fifteen percent said the United States should work alone to
reach Mars. Together, 64 percent favored some program to land
astronauts on Mars, while 30 percent were opposed. The rest had no
opinion.
   Support for a space station was nearly as high, with 55 percent
in favor and 34 percent opposed. The rest had no opinion.
   On the space shuttle, 40 percent said work should be expanded
and the same number said it should be kept at the same level. Fewer
than a fifth said the shuttle program should be cut back.
   The poll found a striking split between the sexes, with men far
more likely than women to favor space programs. Fifty-six percent
of men said the United States was doing too little in space
exploration; only a quarter of women agreed. Forty-one percent of
men supported increasing the space exploration budget, compared
with just 19 percent of women.
   Overall, 40 percent of respondents said the United States was
doing too little in exploring space and 36 percent said it was
doing about enough. Nearly a fifth said the United States was doing
too much in space exploration, the remainder had no opinion.
   Congress created the NASA 30 years ago to pursue civilian
exploration of space. In recent years, the agency increasingly has
carried military payloads as well. A slim plurality in the survey
opposed that development: 48 percent said NASA should be involved
in non-military projects only, while 41 percent approved including
military work. The split was narrowly outside the poll's margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The Media General-AP poll consisted of telephone interviews June
22-July 2 with a randomly selected sample of 1,223 adults across
the nation. Media General Inc., a communications company based in
Richmond, Va., publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond
News Leader, the Tampa (Fla). Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.)
Journal, and operates TV stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in

   Here are some facts and figures on Nagorno-Karabakh, the region
at the heart of an ethnic dispute between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ Located in the Caucasus Mountains in the southern
Soviet Union north of Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh's area is 1,760 square
miles, slightly smaller than Delaware. It is surrounded by
Azerbaijani territory and has no border with Armenia. Its two main
cities are Stepanakert, the region's administrative center, and
Shusha.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ A largely agricultural region with fields of cotton,
grapes, wheat and rye, it has extensive dairy and meat production.
Industries produce construction materials, furniture and electrical
supplies. Its communications and transport links are mostly with
Azerbaijan, not Armenia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLITICAL STATUS _ The region is officially known as the
Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region of Azerbaijan.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POPULATION _ The 1979 Soviet census put Nagorno-Karabakh's
population at 162,000, of which 76 percent were ethnic Armenians
and 23 percent ethnic Azerbaijanis. More than half the region's
people live in rural areas.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Nagorno-Karabakh, one of the earliest areas settled in
what is now the Soviet Union, was part of a region called Artsakh
in the year 1. In Soviet times, according to some reports, the area
was assigned to Armenia under an agreement signed in December 1920
but not put into effect. In 1923, the Kremlin made the region part
of Azerbaijan.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOAL OF THE ANNEXATION MOVEMENT _ Armenians, who are mostly
Christians, complain of cultural and social discrimination under
Azerbaijani rule. Most Azerbaijanis are Moslem. Armenians began
campaigning in February for Nagorno-Karabakh to be annexed to
Armenia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TACTICS _ Armenians have held general strikes and mass
demonstrations to press their demand. The legislature of
Nagorno-Karabakh requested secession from Azerbaijan and annexation
to Armenia. The legislature of the Armenian republic agreed to the
request, but the Azerbaijani leadership refused to give its consent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE KREMLIN'S RESPONSE _ The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,
the nation's highest legislative body, rejected the annexation
demand and instead approved a package of remedial measures to
improve cultural and social conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EFFECTS _ The strikes have caused millions of rubles in lost
production. The dispute led to violence Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijani
city of Sumgait, where 32 people, including 26 Armenians, were
killed in a riot.

<HEAD>Panel Abandons Idea of Taking Mine Inspectors Out of Interior
Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee has quietly given up the
idea of transferring strip mine regulators out of the Interior
Department.
   Leaders of the House subcommittee on environment, energy and
natural resources of the Government Operations Committee, long
critical of the department's Office of Surface Mining, made the
decision earlier this month after a discouraging report from the
General Accounting Office.
   The GAO, Congress' research arm, said such a move ``could
disrupt and destabilize the program for two or more years'' and
would not necessarily mean improvements.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., the subcommittee chairman, and Rep.
Bill Clinger, R-Pa., wrote other members that in light of the
report, ``we think that a transfer at this time is not the way to
solve the existing problems.''
   The letter, provided last week by subcommittee aides, said no
members had expressed disagreement with the conclusion.
   ``We plan to urge that the incoming administration, whether
Republican or Democratic, give top priority to making the
fundamental changes necessary,'' Synar and Clinger said.
   A year ago Synar asked GAO to investigate transferring the
Office of Surface Mining to some other agency. He first raised the
idea two years ago following a subcommittee report that documented
difficulties the office had in getting states to enforce their own
regulations and in collecting fine and penalties.
   James Duffus III, GAO associate director, said in a report dated
June 9 that only one of 16 people consulted from environmental
groups, the coal industry and state governments favored moving the
office out of interior.
   ``After 10 years of struggle to implement (the act), stability
is needed,'' was the consensus.
   The dissenter, Hope Babcock of the National Audubon Society,
argued that ``moving this function would eliminate the
institutional conflict that exists at interior between developing
mineral resources and protecting the environment and would send a
clear signal to the receiving agency that it should given
additional attention'' to the mission of the office, Duffus
reported.
   Babcock said in the report that the Environmental Protection
Agency should take over the regulatory role ``because of its
experience with water pollution and runoff, water expertise and
good reputation as a regulatory agency, and experience dealing with
citizens' concerns and involvement in pollution problems.''
   Another view came from former Deputy Undersecretary of Interior
Steve Quarles, now a staff member at the National Academy of
Sciences, who suggested grouping all of interior's regulatory
programs under one assistant secretary.
   He said the mining industry did not believe EPA would ``provide
a proper balance between (the act's) stated goals of energy
production and environmental protection.''
   ``We have also reported problems in EPA's management with
respect to cleaning up hazardous waste and enforcing air
standards,'' the report said.
   The GAO also said there would be a long period of adjustment to
any change.
   ``Substantial problems during initial periods of reorganization
are inevitable,'' such as ``delays in obtaining key agency
officials, inadequate staffing, insufficient funding, inadequate
office space and difficulties in establishing support functions
such as payroll and accounting systems,'' the report said.
   ``We found that solving these start-up problems resulted in
delays ranging from nine to 30 months and distracted agency
officials from concentrating on their new missions during the
critical first year of operations,'' GAO said.
   Alan Cole, spokesman for the Office of Surface Mining, said,
``We agree that it would be counterproductive to transfer the
(office) to another agency.''

   Sitting stiffly and avoiding eye
contact, the leaders of four groups fighting for Cambodia began
their first talks today to try to fashion a political settlement.
   Their host, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, said they
would discuss such difficult issues as national reconciliation,
forming a provisional government and building a neutral Cambodia,
which has been at war almost continuously since 1970.
   ``We of course realize that on these aspects ... there are
divergences of views among you and that many years of conflict and
contention have caused estrangment that may impede a quick
convergence of positions,'' he said in an opening speech.
   Alatas said such a complex problem couldn't be solved through a
single meeting, but a solution will never be found unless a start
is made to replace war with dialogue.
   The four Cambodian leaders gathered in a chandeliered room in
the old palace of the late President Sukarno for informal
``cocktail party'' talks that have raised hopes for peace in
Cambodia.
   In large easy chairs around a thick, circular table sat Hun Sen,
prime minister of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government, and
leaders of three guerrilla groups opposing him. They were Khieu
Samphan of the Khmer Rouge, Son Sann of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who is representing
his father, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   As they gathered, three saffron-robed Cambodian Buddhist monks
who had traveled from the United States, Canada and France filed
into the palace to pray for success.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and by Western
count maintains more than 100,000 troops there, was to meet the
Cambodians in a second stage of talks in the afternoon. That
meeting was also to be attended by Vietnam's Communist ally, Laos,
and by members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which
backs the guerrillas.
   At a photo session just before the morning talks, the leaders
smiled at photographers and Khieu Samphan waved, but they
studiously avoided making eye contact with one another.
   Instead they gazed at huge Western-style oil paintings on the
walls.
   Hun Senn and Sihanouk have held two previous rounds of talks
without success, and the current meeting represents the first
gathering of all four Cambodia parties.
   Vietnam has never talked with the Cambodian resistance factions.
   Sihanouk, meanwhile, was visiting Jakarta, the Indonesian
capital just 40 miles from Bogor but had no known plans to attend
the talks. A Indonesian source said the former Cambodian monarch
might make an appearance in Bogor, depending on progress in the
talks.
   Earlier this month Sihanouk resigned as president of the
guerrilla coalition, charging the Khmer Rouge were killing his men.
   The tentative schedule called for two days of talks with the
second day having the same format as the first _ the Cambodian
factions talking in the morning, then the Vietnamese and others
joining in the afternoon.
   The talks are based on a July 1987 Vietnam-Indonesia agreement
that calls for informal discussions to encourage the various
antagonists to participate and allay Vietnam's refusal to negotiate
directly with the guerrillas.
   Disputes between Vietnam and Association of Southeast Asian
Nations delayed the talks, which were not confirmed until the last
minute. The association includes the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei,
Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.
   Since 1970, Cambodia has suffered a devastating five-year civil
war, a reign of terror by the Chinese-backed Communist Khmer Rouge
from 1975 to 1978, a 1978 Vietnamese invasion and a continuing
guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed government.
   Millions of people have been killed in the turmoil.
   Vietnam has announced it will withdraw 50,000 troops, or about
half its force in Cambodia, this year and the rest by early 1990.
   Though Son Sann and Sihanouk are allied with the Khmer Rouge in
a resistance coalition, they strongly distrust the Khmer Rouge
because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled
Cambodia.

   Thirty drivers saddled up their buses
for a 10th annual rodeo, as ribs and chicken sizzled on open-pit
grills.
   The Port Authority Transit rodeo was slower-moving than a
Western counterpart, but competitors said it requires an equal
amount of skill.
   ``A lot of people couldn't drive a car through this course, let
alone a 40-foot bus,'' driver Ed Gillett said Sunday as he eyed the
orange cones and barrels charting the course across the Castle
Shannon subway station parking lot, near Pittsburgh.
   The buses lumbered through the cones, squashing some along the
way. Judges in cowboy hats made notations on clipboards, and a
country-western band played.
   Drivers were allowed seven minutes to steer their buses through
the maze. Jim ``J.R.'' Jones, who hit the fewest cones in the
fastest time, won.
   ``They do serpentines, three-point turns, backward parking and
curbing the bus,'' said Debra DeCourcy, an organizer. ``The rodeo
allows them to show off their talent that most people take for
granted.''

   It used to be that Illinois' lottery millionaires
could count on leaving their wallets home at least one day a year _
the day of the Millionaire's Reunion.
   But this year, after criticism that the lavish reunions were a
waste of taxpayers' money, a thriftier affair is planned and the
millionaires are getting stuck with some of the tab.
   The big money winners used to get lunch on a cruise ship, dinner
and dancing at a classy spot and a night at a top hotel.
   At this year's reunion, on Aug. 19, they'll get beer, bratwurst
and baseball _ and they'll have to pay for their own hotel rooms.
   Chester Nyc, a $3.8 million-winner from Elk Grove Village, says
he'll attend the luncheon, but skip the Cubs game, dinner and a
special discount night at a Hyatt hotel.
   ``I thought the cost of last year's (reunion) was kind of
exorbitant, but I'm conservative that way,'' Nyc said.

   Nine ducklings and their parents lived it up at
the swank Ritz Carlton Hotel where they swam in a Jacuzzi and dined
on escargot, fresh lettuce, melba toast and bottled spring water
served by white-gloved waiters.
   The ducklings were flown in from North Carolina for a
fund-raising re-creation Sunday of the 1941 children's book ``Make
Way for Ducklings,'' which is set in Boston's Public Garden's pond.
   Children from a private elementary school in Morganton, N.C.,
flew in Saturday on a charter flight along with the ducks and Robin
Edwards, an organizer of the event to raise money for the school.
   ``We visited Boston two years ago on a field trip and the
children saw the ducks,'' Edwards said. ``They were very familiar
with the book and that's when the idea for this project started.''
   In the story, a Boston policeman befriends the ducks, which take
up a residence in the pond.
   As Edwards read from the book Sunday, about 200 people gathered
around a sculpture that's near the pond and is dedicated to the
story.
   The ducks, billed as the only known descendants of Mr. and Mrs.
Mallard in Robert McCloskey's story, were taken in their cages to
the pond and set free.
   Organizers hope to raise funds for an addition at the school
through a $5-an-entry ``Name the Duck'' contest for the ninth
duckling. In the story, there are just eight ducklings: Jack, Kack,
Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack and Quack.

   It takes more than 12 hours of
practice a day under blazing sun or summer rain to get the
precision right.
   But any student who wants to be in the Garfield Cadets Drum and
Bugle Corps knows that is the kind of summer $500 will buy.
   ``It's a lot like Marine Corps boot camp,'' said 19-year-old
Dennis Klophaus, a first-year corps member from Jacksonville, N.C.
   The 54-year-old corps, headquartered in the northern New Jersey
city of Garfield, is made up of student musicians, ages 14 to 21,
from across the United States and Canada.
   The cadets are the current Drum Corp International champions.
Next month, they will try for an unprecedented fifth DCI World
Championship as they compete against 70 other corps in Kansas City.
   Until then, the Garfield Cadets, who number about 100, will don
their maroon and off-white uniforms and strut their stuff across
eight states and Canada as they complete the second half of their
Summer 1988 tour.
   ``The biggest thing that makes them special is the type of
training,'' said Marc Sylvester, a visual instructor. ``It's very
extreme.''
   Sylvester, 30, stands on the bleachers during practice to make
sure the cadets' presentations are pleasing to the eye.
   ``The type of work and pressure they go through is similar to
what someone in their age group would do when trying out for the
Olympics,'' Sylvester said. ``The prestige of winning is ... like
winning a gold medal.''
   George Hopkins, the group's executive director since 1982, said
the corps challenges itself by purposely bypassing anything that
might come easily in favor of the most difficult routines.
   ``If we know that we can do it, then we will not do it,''
Hopkins said.
   A day at training camp in this northern New Jersey community
begins at 7:30 a.m., when the corps rises, eats breakfast and
starts practicing no later than 8:30.
   About 2:30 p.m., they eat again. They return to practice a half
hour later. Dinner is served at 6:30 p.m., then the cadets are back
at work for three more hours.
   They're free until lights out at 11, but often spend the time
discussing improvements for the routine, said Tom Hawrylko, a corps
spokesman.
   All this, including bedding down on gymnasium floors, costs
$500, which the cadets pay as a membership fee.
   ``I wanted to learn what hard work is and what it does to you,''
said first-year cadet David Geltch of Washington Crossing, Pa.
``It's made me concentrate more.''
   Mark Poquis, a 20-year-old baritone horn player from Burke, Va.,
said: ``I learned that no matter how downhill and exhausted you
are, you can still push yourself that extra step. It builds
character.''
   Following the cadets from city to city is an 18-wheel truck that
carries food and other supplies. Another 18-wheeler carries the
instruments, along with the streamers and flags for the color
guard. Four buses transport the cadets, vans carry instructors and
support staff, and a 24-foot promotional bus tags along.
   Like most other drum and bugle corps, the Garfield Cadets raise
money with cake sales, car washes, donations and raffles, along
with membership fees. The corps has an annual budget of $450,000 to
$500,000, said Gregory Pych, a member of the board of directors.
   This year, however, the cadets received their first corporate
sponsorship, from K mart Stores and Emerson Radio, Pych said. He
said exact figures were not available.
   Besides becoming better musicians, the cadets are taught good
competitive manners, Sylvester said.
   ``You never are a sore loser or an obnoxious winner,'' he said.

   The Secret Service is opposing a request from
St. Elizabeths Hospital to allow presidential assailant John

   ``We don't believe he should be released under any conditions,''

   Hinckley was committed to the hospital in 1982 after he was
found innocent by reason of insanity in the shooting of President
Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, a Secret Service
agent and a D.C. policeman.
   City mental health officials said a review board at St.
Elizabeths has approved Hinckley's participation in an outing to a
museum, park or other public place.
   But federal prosecutors have asked a judge to hold a hearing on
the proposed day trip. The last time St. Elizabeths sought
permission for an off-grounds activity for Hinckley was last year,
but the request was dropped after it was disclosed that Hinckley
had corresponded with Theodore Bundy, a convicted serial killer.

the Embassy of Madagascar.
   No one was injured in the fires, which happened before dawn
while Ambassador Leon M. Rajaobelina was home with his family.
   ``I smelled the smoke of the fire, so I decided to awaken my
family,'' said Rajaobelina said of the first fire, which broke out
in a reception area around 2:17 a.m. EDT.
   No injuries were reported in either fire and damage was

   Keepers at the National Zoo are watching
Ling-Ling, the giant female panda, for signs that she may be
pregnant again.
   Recent laboratory tests show the same hormonal pattern that was
observed when Ling-Ling was pregnant last year, zoo spokesman Mike
Morgan.
   ``A lot of people are feeling positive, but no one will say for
certainty that Ling-Ling is pregnant,'' he said. ``There are
reservations.''
   If she is pregnant, she probably would give birth during the
last couple of days of July or the first week of August, he said.
She has given birth to four cubs at the zoo, all of which have died.

<HEAD>New Corn Plant Could Help Third World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government agency is touting a new strain of
corn as a potential source of protein for children in the Third
World.
   The National Research Council calls the new corn QPM for
quality-protein maize because it contains about twice the usable
protein of ordinary varieties. Maize is the international word for
corn.
   A small research team, working for 10 years, developed QPM at
the same laboratories where Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman E.
Borlaug produced the new wheat varieties that brought the ``green
revolution'' in the 1950s.
   The report suggests distributing QPM in areas that already
depend heavily on corn to feed small children: South America,
Central America, most of Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the
Philippines.
   ``Maize is often the crop of the poor, and in the maize-growing
areas of the world, millions of children living in poverty are not
thriving,'' says the report of a panel appointed by the council.
``Here is an opportunity to explore this new approach to relieving
an intolerable situation.''

<HEAD>Talks Between U.S., Soviet Militaries Might Spur Arms Reductions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet military officials have told their U.S.
counterparts that top-level talks between the nations' militaries
might resolve technical problems that are roadblocks to agreement
on conventional force reductions, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported today that the Soviet Union's top
defense officials, during a recent six-day tour of the United
States, said the military contacts might lead to a formula for
reduction that has eluded civilian arms negotiators because it
would be based on a joint military assessment of what constitutes
equal strength.
   The paper quoted sources as saying that Soviet Marshal Sergei
Akhromeyev told Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, that equal strength need not mean one-to-one
equality in the numbers of arms and equipment because of
technological and structural differences between the two militaries.
   Crowe and Akhromeyev spent hours explaining to each other their
basic military doctrines and the fears they have about each other,
the Post said. They agreed, the paper quoted Crowe as saying last
week, that there are two problems to be overcome, ``Mistrust and
the difference in the structures of our two militaries.''
   The discussions between Crowe and Akhromeyev have enabled the
pair to form a personal relationship, similar to one that has
developed between Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and Soviet
Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov, according to the Post.
   Next week, Carlucci will travel to the Soviet Union for his
third round of private meetings with Yazov. The two already have
spent nearly 14 hours together discussing similar questions of
doctrine and forces, first in Bern last March and then during the
May summit in Moscow.
   At Akhromeyev's invitation, Crowe is planning a trip to the
Soviet Union sometime next year.

<HEAD>Jackson Leaves Atlanta, Says Convention Was `Tremendous Moment'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson quietly ended his dramatic week in
Atlanta saying his mission now is to help Mike Dukakis win the
White House this year.
   ``My focus now is on the fall campaign,'' he told reporters as
he left a downtown Atlanta hotel Saturday. ``We'll be spending a
lot of time organizing for voter registration, issue
interpretation, involving people _ many for the first time _ and a
big turnout for the fall campaign.''
   Jackson, who finished second to Dukakis in his second race for
the presidency, would not talk about whether he would make a third
run for national office.
   ``We'll have to determine what will happen, based on the outcome
of the campaign. But we take this journey one phase at a time,'' he
said.
   Jackson took members of his family, campaign staffers and
journalists who covered his bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination to Paschal's, a well-known black-owned hotel and
restaurant, for lunch, then left from Fulton County Airport in a
chartered jet.
   Jackson's relaxed departure was a marked contrast to the
motorcade of buses he took to Atlanta July 16, two days before the
start of the Democratic convention.
   He addressed thousands of cheering supporters in Piedmont Park
that day, asserting that Dukakis, then assured of the nomination,
must give Jackson a stronger voice in the party.
   Jackson said Saturday his campaign made great gains in Atlanta.
   He said blacks and others previously outside the party
mainstream will have unprecedented involvement in the fall
campaign. And he noted that several Jackson platform positions were
adopted.
   ``We can leave Atlanta with a real sense of inspiration because
of the expansion of the Democratic Party, more inclusion,
involvement in the campaign at all levels, vertically and
horizontally,'' he said.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs lede to show clarify that survey counts Walton family
wealth; picks up 2nd graf, The Waltons</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Walton and family
remained the wealthiest people in the United States last year even
though the value of their stock lost more than $135 million, U.S.
News & World Report says.
   The Waltons of Bentonville, Ark., whose stores are fixtures in
small-town America, held $6.13 billion worth of stock in Wal-Mart,
keeping them atop the magazine's Richest 100 list for the third
straight time since the rankings began three years ago, U.S. News
said in its Aug. 1 editions.
   To make the list, an individual or family must own at least 5
percent of the shares of a publicly traded company. This is the
level the government considers large enough to influence management.
   In second spot again were Irenee and Edward du Pont and family
of Wilmington, Del., with $3.38 billion worth of the giant chemical
firm. U.S. News said the du Ponts kept the ranking despite a $1.3
billion loss in stock value in the 12 months ending in Marchy.
   David Packard, the computer pioneer from Los Altos Hills,
Calif., jumped from seventh spot in 1987 to third this year, with
$2.56 billion worth of holdings in Hewlett-Packard Co.
   No. 4 in the latest list were Carl Lindner and family of
Cincinnati, with $2.3 billion worth of holdings in food, financial
services, retailing and electronics firms. The Lindners were not in
the Top 10 last year.
   In fifth spot, up one from 1987, were John Dorrance Jr. and
family of Gladwyne, Pa., with $2.05 billion worth of the Campbell
Soup Co.
   Others in the Top 10 were Edgar and Charles Bronfman and family
of New York and Montreal, Seagram Co. Ltd., $1.88 billion; Sid,
Lee, Robert and Edward Bass of Ft. Worth, Texas, a variety of
holdings, $1.75 billion; Warren Buffett of Omaha, Neb., Berkshire
Hathaway, $1.64 billion; William Ford and family of Grosse Point
Shores, Mich., Ford Motor Co., $1.62 billion; and the Bancroft
family of New York, Dow Jones & Co., $1.61 billion.
   U.S. News said the Bancrofts fell from third position in 1987
because of a $1.19 billion loss in stock value last year. It said
other stock-value losses included $859 million for the Bronfmans,
$510 million for the Dorrances and $320 million for the Lindners.
   U.S. News said the year's biggest money loser was Leslie Wexner
of Columbus Ohio, whose holdings in The Limited clothing stores
fell in value by $1.4 billion, or nearly 55 percent. Wexner was
ranked 17th among 18 billionaires on the list.

<TEXT>
   The spiritual leader of pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem extremists believed to be holding foreigners hostage
in Lebanon has called for a new approach to the crisis that would
bring a ``happy ending.''
   Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, made the comments just as Iran prepared
to enter U.N.-sponsored talks to end its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Fadlallah, in a sermon Sunday, accused the United States and
Europe of using the hostage crisis for political purposes. But he
also called for a swift resolution to the problem.
   ``We call for a just and practical solution to this problem to
achieve a happy ending,'' he said.
   ``We are aware that the (hostages) problem has reached such a
degree of complexity that its political aspect has become mixed up
with its humanitarian aspect.''
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for the militant Shiite
factions holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon. Nine
Americans are among the captives.
   Fadlallah's comments came during a one-hour sermon to Shiite
zealots marking the major Moslem feast of al-Adha in south Beirut's
Bir el-Abed mosque.
   The hostages are widely believed to be held in Hezbollah's Hay
Madi barracks building about ten blocks from mosque in Beirut's
southern suburbs, a Shiite stronghold.
   Syria has had some 5,000 troops patrolling most of the southern
suburbs since May 27, but they have stayed away from the immediate
area of the barracks apparently to avert a military confrontation
that could imperil the hostages.
   Syrian soldiers, however, control all approaches to Hay Madi and
man high-rise apartment buildings overlooking the barracks.
   It was not clear whether Fadlallah's call signaled a
breakthrough for the hostages. He has made similar calls during the
past two years with no results.
   ``On the occasion of this feast, we call on all sides to begin
acting in a political sphere so that the humanitarian aspect of
this problem could be resolved,'' he said.
   ``We feel pain for the detention (of the hostages) because the
issue has humanitarian aspects,'' Fadlallah said.
   Fadlallah accused the United States and European nations of
``manipulating the issue of the hostages for political reasons to
impose their dominance on the world.
   ``America has not moved to fight terrorism but has rather used
it as a means of political pressure on each country and people that
resist its imperlialist policies,'' he added.
   It was Fadlallah's first reference to the hostages issue since
Iran announced July 18 that it was accepting the year-old U.N.
Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in its war
with Iraq.
   Political observers believe a truce in the war could facilitate
efforts for the release of the hostages.
   Nine Americans are among the 18 hostages. The longest held is
Terry Anderson, 40, chief Mmiddle Eeast correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was seized March 16, 1985.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, reached by telephone Sunday at her
home in Cadiz, Ky., said, ``I don't see that it (the holding of
hostages) should be a political issue. It's a human issue.
   ``Everything I've been hearing out of the Middle East lately
gives us reason to hope and it's been a very, very long time since
we've had occasion to be hopeful.''

<HEAD>FDA To Allow Import Of AIDS Treatment Drugs Not Approved For U.S.
Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN VEGA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency's decision to allow AIDS patients
to import treatment drugs that have not been approved for sale in
this country gives new hope to victims of the deadly disease, a
homosexual rights activist said.
   Dr. Frank E. Young, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, announced the change Saturday during an address at
a conference here on homosexual health issues.
   Young said the government officially began allowing importation
of some unapproved treatments of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome Wednesday.
   ``(The decision) allows AIDS patients to make some choices about
their own treatment,'' said Ellen Ratner, president of the National
Lesbian and Gay Health Foundation, which sponsored the conference.
``If you're dying, you don't have a lot of choices.''
   A Harvard School of Public Health attorney who researches
worldwide AIDS policies agreed.
   ``From the AIDS person's point of view, they have nothing to
lose and what they need is just some little optimism in their
life,'' the attorney, Larry Gostin, said Sunday. ``If there's a
risk, I think that they should be able to make the decision about
whether to assume that risk.''
   He called the program ``a signal advance in recognizing the gay
and IV-drug constituencies that have been calling for this.''
Intravenous drug users, along with homosexual males, are the
primary sufferers from AIDS.
   ``It's almost a shock because it's so contrary to the character
and the tradition of the FDA,'' Gostin said.
   Psychologist Winfield Scott, associate dean for education at
George Washington University Medical Center, said the change
responds to the frustration felt by homosexuals ``that (AIDS)
answers aren't coming more quickly.''
   ``I am a gay person myself. (But) I think that the frustration
focuses on the bureaucracy as though the ultimate obstacles were in
the bureaucracy,'' Scott said. ``The real problem is that nature is
very slow and reluctant to yield up her secrets.''
   Scott said he believes AIDS patients' desire for experimental
drugs can be balanced with scientists' reluctance to use the drugs
if the patients ``give up the right to sue if things go badly.''
   Young and other FDA officials said that such unapproved drugs as
dextran sulfate and ribavirin have been allowed into the country on
an informal basis.
   The new policy sets a formal procedure for those who certify
that the drug is for their own use. Small amounts will be allowed,
generally enough for three months of treatment, as an assurance
that the drug is not intended for sale.
   Ribavirin is an anti-viral drug that can be purchased in Japan
and Mexico.
   Dextran sulfate, developed as a blood thinner, has been used in
Japan for about 20 years to lower cholesterol and other fats in the
blood. Some laboratory reports have indicated it deters the AIDS
virus.
   Young said the FDA maintains the right to deny any shipments
into the county. It changed its policy in part because some AIDS
treatments were coming in as contraband.
   ``All of us are dealing with a time line that is fierce,'' Young
said.
   He said some of the drugs have been shown to help combat the
disease, which is spread most often through sexual contact, needles
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products and from
pregnant women to their offspring.
   Despite the change, some still accused the government of failing
to do enough to permit the use of drugs to help treat AIDS victims.
   ``He announced the policy because he heard there were going to
be protests and he wanted to placate us,'' said Debbie Levine of
the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. ``But we're not
going to be placated with just dribs and drabs.''
   Homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the
68,220 U.S. AIDS cases counted by the government since June 1981.
There have been 38,541 deaths, or 56 percent of total cases, the
Centers for Disease Control reported last week.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said today that
police killed four suspected guerrillas who threw grenades that
injured 12 officers when a weapons-packed car was stopped at a
roadblock near Botswana.
   Police said that when the car was stopped Sunday on the road
between Mafikeng, Botswana and Lichtenburg, South Africa, two hand
grenades were thrown from it at security force members manning the
roadblock.
   Five officers were hurt and police opened fire at the vehicle,
killing two black men and a black woman, police said.
   Another black man was taken a short distance from the roadblock
to be searched and was shot to death when he primed a hand grenade,
police said.
   When the man fell on the grenade it detonated, injuring another
seven officers, police added.
   None of the 12 officers were seriously injured, police said.
   Police said TNT, automatic weapons, detonators and hand grenades
were found in the car.
   South Africa has repeatedly accused Botswana of allowing
guerrillas of the outlawed African National Congress to infiltrate
South Africa from its territory.
   Botswana denies the charge and says most bombings and sabotage
in South Africa are carried out by people in the country.
   South Africa has made several raids into Botswana, attacking
what it says are targets of the ANC, which is seeking to overthrow
South Africa's white-led government and replace it with majority
rule.

   An out of control stock car flew through a fence
and into the bleachers during a race, killing one spectator and
injuring 13 others, authorities said.
   The driver, who estimated he was traveling at 50 mph, was able
to walk away from Sunday's crash at Lakeside Speedway.
   The car, which landed in an open space between the guard rails
and the grandstands after tearing through a chain link fence,
``looked like it had gone through a compactor,'' said Lakeside
police Sgt. Bob Wall.
   Those injured were sitting in the front row, said spectator Mike
Garrison of Thornton.
   Another race driver, Don Cash, said he was about five lengths
behind the car driven by Gary Burton when Burton lost control.
   ``He hit the wall and got airborne,'' said Cash. ``I looked
again and it (the car) just went around like a helicopter.''
   Burton, 22, got out and walked away after the crash, Cash said.
   Burton was taken to a hospital shaken but uninjured, authorities
said.
   Burton said the track was slick. ``The car got loose and tagged
the guardrail. I got a little too close to the guardrail,'' said
Burton.
   Kristy Carlson, 26, of suburban Arvada, was pronounced dead at
St. Anthony Hospital late Sunday, said spokesman Randy Shook.
   Twelve others were injured and taken to hospitals, but only a
4-year-old girl with a broken arm and head injuries was admitted
for observation.
   The accident occurred midway through the 25-lap main event on
the fifth-mile paved oval, Cash said.
   Lakeside is a tiny incorporated town between Denver and Wheat
Ridge with a population of about 15 residents.

<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's attorney general vowed to
remove ``bad elements'' from the federal police and conduct a full
investigation into the deaths of a TV anchorwoman and two other
people by police machine-gun fire.
   ``We're not going to stop fighting corruption. We're going to
clean up the police force,'' Attorney General Sergio Garcia Ramirez
said during a visit to this city on the U.S. border to initiate an
investigation into the shootings.
   Linda Bejarano, 28, co-anchor for XHIJ-TV of Juarez; her
mother-in-law, Lucrecia Martinez de Gomez, 58; and family friend
Carlos Alfonso Garcia, 25, were gunned down in their car about 3
a.m. Saturday by men identifying themselves as Federal Judicial
Police, officials said.
   Ms. Bejarano's husband and co-anchor, Manuel Gomez, was in the
car but escaped injury by lying on the floor.
   A Federal Judicial Police officer and three officers on the city
police force were arrested, according to Notimex, Mexico's
government news agency.
   Garcia said the three were ``madrinas,'' underlings who work
illegally for members of the elite federal force.
   Though illegal, the use of madrinas reportedly is widespread in
Juarez. The ``officers,'' lured by the chance to work with Mexico's
highest police agency and carry automatic weapons, often have
little or no training.
   City police Chief Fernando Motta Allen later denied the three
were on the city police force.
   If an investigation determines the three are not commissioned
officers, they will face charges of usurpation of police powers as
well as of homicide, District Attorney Alberto Salinas said Sunday.
   Garcia suspended the chief of the Juarez Federal Judicial Police
pending an investigation, and said he wanted the use of madrinas to
end.
   ``I am absolutely against that corrupt and dishonest practice,''
he said. ``My indignation is great. ...
   ``The bad elements (in the federal force) will be removed. There
are good elements in the force, ones who devote their lives to it.
That isn't the case in this instance. But the bad agents will be
removed. We won't let this blow over.''
   Carlos Armendariz, acting head of the Juarez detachment of the
federal police, said the four detainees mistook the victims' car
for one involved in a police shootout two hours earlier on a
highway south of Juarez.
   Occupants of the first car were suspected of being drug
traffickers. Police said they found the abandoned car Saturday
afternoon in Juarez, with bullet holes in the rear window and more
than 80 pounds of cocaine stashed in the trunk. There were no
arrests.
   Gomez said he, his wife and the two others were returning from a
birthday party when men identifying themselves as Federal Judicial
Police shouted to him to pull over. He said he didn't because he
was afraid the men would search his car and steal $12,000 cash he
had just collected for doing publicity for a traveling circus.
   In the last six years, there have been more than 20 unsolved
killings of Mexican journalists. Journalistic groups allege that
some of the reporters were killed in revenge for their work or to
silence them.
   But reporters at XHIJ said neither Gomez nor Ms. Berajano were
known for exposing drug traffickers or government corruption.
   Gomez met with Juarez reporters Sunday night and asked them to
support his efforts to seek justice. He said he feared for his two
daughters and himself because he believed at least one gunman
remained free.
   ``I want to ask you to help me to demand that they not permit
this (deed) to be forgotten,'' he said.
   The three deaths prompted Chihuahua Gov. Fernando Baeza to buy
advertisements of sympathy in Sunday's Juarez newspapers.
   At the funeral home where the bodies of Ms. Bejarano and Ms.
Martinez lay, hundreds of mourners streamed in all day Sunday. More
than 40 large wreaths lined the walls of the viewing chapel.

   The storm system swept over southeastern Nebraska, northeastern
Kansas, and from eastern Iowa to western lower Michigan early today.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from southeastern New
Mexico to southwestern Oklahoma, and from northeast Arkansas into
western Kentucky and western Tennessee.
   The thunderstorms Sunday night spawned severe weather in
Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa and Oklahoma.
   In Nebraska, Uehling, Cedar Bluffs and Garland were pelted by
hail the size of golf balls. The storms also whipped winds to 73
mph at Brainard and downed trees at Seward.
   In Wisconsin, the large hail struck areas north of Rhinelander
and high winds ripped down trees and power lines at Sheboygan.
   In Lake City, Iowa, a dispatcher of the Calhoun County Sheriff's
Department said hail covered parts of the city Sunday night. ``The
ground was completely white,'' she said.
   In Holyoke, Mass., the roof of the Sears, Roebuck and Co. store
partially collapsed Sunday morning, police said. The store was
closed at the time and there were no reported injuries.
   A night of heavy rains may have caused the section of roof _
approximately 65 feet long and 10 feet wide _ to cave in, police
said.
   Early today, a few showers lingered along a cold front in the
eastern United States.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over Florida, the Georgia and Carolina coast, northern New England
and northeast New York, from Michigan across the lower Ohio and
middle Mississippi valleys to northern Mississippi, Arkansas and
north central Texas; and widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms
for the Southwest, with the most numerous storms in the mountains.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s over northern
New England and the upper Great Lakes region; between 95 and 100
degrees over interior portions of the lower Mississippi Valley;
between 95 and 105 over lower elevations west of the Rockies, near
115 degrees in portions of the desert Southwest; in the 70s and 80s
through most Pacific coast; and in the 80s and 90s over the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at North Bend, Ore., to 95 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Strikes Said To End In Disputed Region, Though Some Fight On</HEAD>

   Ethnic Armenians in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh
region went back to tending fields, driving buses and building
homes today after their two-month strike failed to bring unity with
Armenia, state-run media reported.
   An end to the latest strike in the predominantly Armenian
enclave of the southern republic of Azerbaijan would signal a step
toward normalcy for an area in tumult since February.
   Still, a resident in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's capital,
said some of the region's 162,000 people will press on with the
annexation campaign.
   ``Today people went to work. Transport is operating and we have
ended our strikes,'' reported the engineer for the State
Broadcasting Committee. She declined to give her name.
   ``The situation is still very tense,'' she said by telephone.
``The decision has done little for us and we will continue this
fight to the end. But what is the sense of continuing to strike?''
   The Kremlin leadership decided a week ago that Nagorno-Karabakh
will remain part of the Azerbaijan, which has ruled it since 1923.
   Nagorno-Karabh's Armenians, predominantly Christian like their
brethren in the neighboring Armenian republic, have waged a vocal
campaign for annexation. They contend they suffer discrimination
under the Azeris, most of whom are Moslem.
   The annexation drive was opposed by the Azerbaijani leadership,
and the struggle over control of Nagorno-Karabakh has fueled ethnic
tensions in the Caucasus.
   Mass demonstrations by Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and the
Armenian capital of Yerevan have drawn hundreds of thousands of
people. And on Feb. 28, the unrest became violent when 26 Armenians
and six other people were killed in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.
   After Moscow's rejection of the annexation bid became known in
Yerevan last week, activists called for a five-day protest strike.
But most residents heeded official warnings against prolonging the
labor unrest.
   Strikes continued in Nagorno-Karabakh through the weekend, but
state-run Radio Moscow reported today that most workers in the
region had decided to end the stoppage.
   Neither Radio Moscow nor the engineer reached in Stepanakert
explained why residents decided to return to work, and other calls
to the region did not go through.
   The official news agency Tass reported that the Armenian
Communist Party leadership met Sunday and that local officials were
blamed for allowing the annexation drive to get out of hand.
   Party leaders said ``the situation that has shaped in the
republic over the recent months has been a result of gross
miscalculations and errors in the political, organizational and
ideological work of party committees, of primary party
organizations,'' Tass said.
   Adhering to the tougher stance against ethnic strife outlined by
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a speech a week ago, Tass
said the Armenian party leadership ``failed to sense the political
danger of unjustifiable calls for revision of the existing
national-territorial structure.''
   Pravda, the party's central newspaper, also criticized Armenian
party leaders who took up the cause of annexing the region, calling
for review and rectification of their ``political immaturity.''

<HEAD>Scriptwriters, Producers Talks Recess; More Scheduled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A negotiating session between striking
scriptwriters and producers recessed early today after nearly 13
hours, but more talks to end the 20-week-old strike were scheduled,
union officials said.
   The session between the striking Writers Guild of America began
about 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the Sherman Oaks headquarters of the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and was
monitored by a federal mediator.
   The talks recessed at 2:15 a.m. today but were scheduled to
resume at 3 p.m., said Cheryl Rhoden, a guild spokeswoman.
   ``We went to the meeting prepared to negotiate in good faith in
order to reach a fair deal to both sides,'' Brian Walton, executive
director of the guild's West Coast unit, said in a taped message to
members. ``We're committed to do that and to continue the process.''
   The session that ended early today followed a 13-hour round of
talks Saturday. That was the first time the two sides had conducted
formal talks in more than a month.
   Guild President George Kirgo said union negotiators were
prepared for any new development that may arise, but refused to
elaborate, citing a news blackout agreed upon by both sides at the
request of federal mediator Leonard Farrell.
   Previous talks ended in June with scriptwriters coast-to-coast
overwhelmingly rejecting a compromise offer from producers.
   Since the strike began March 7, the main sticking point has been
the share of money writers make when hour-long television shows go
into reruns.
   Despite some internal dissention, the 9,000-plus member guild
has remained firm in its demand for a bigger cut of the so-called
residual profits, and has divided producers' ranks by getting some
independent filmmakers to defect, allowing them to hire writers
under separate contracts granting guild demands.
   The strike has slowed down the entertainment industry and
resulted in layoffs.
   Television networks, their fall schedules in shambles, have
insisted they will broadcast new fall programming even if they have
to refilm old scripts with new actors.

   A 25-year-old man who apparently thought his
girlfriend was refusing to answer her door tried to enter from a
window ledge and fell seven stories to his death, police said.
   But neither the girl nor her father, with whom she lived, was
home at the time, said Sgt. Michael Chasen.
   He said the victim, Robert Jenkins, quarreled with his
girlfriend earlier in the day Sunday.
   ``So he went up to the apartment and, we think, he knocked on
the door and when he got no answer figured she was trying to avoid
him,'' Chasen said. ``So he tried to be sneaky.''
   Chasen said Jenkins crawled out on a narrow ledge and tried to
get to a window of his girlfriend's apartment, but fell into a
parking lot, landing near a car and setting off the auto's theft
alarm.
   A building custodian heard the alarm and called police.

   Pedro Delgado of Spain won the Tour de France while
Jeannie Longo of Grenoble captured the title in the shorter women's
version of bicycling's most important race.
   Delgado, after five years of setbacks, crossed the finish line
first Sunday in the 75th running of the race, which began July 4.
He received messages from King Juan Carlos of Spain and a personal
welcome from more than 5,000 residents of his hometown of Segovia
who traveled to Paris to cheer their hero.
   ``In this moment I am thinking only of my mother,'' said
Delgado, 28, who was forced to withdraw from the 1984 Tour de
France when his mother died during the race. ``I promised myself I
would win this race for her.''
   With five stages left in this year's 2,036-mile race, he had
another crisis that threatened his lead, which he gained July 14.
It was revealed that a drug test taken July 15 turned out positive,
and a second test confirmed he had traces of probenicid in his
system.
   He was not penalized because the drug, often used to cover
detection of anabolic steroids, is not on the list of banned
substances of the International Cycling Union.
   For the second straight year, Longo, 29, of Grenoble in eastern
France, won the 524-mile women's race, which began July 11.

<HEAD>Aquino Says Communists Losing War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today said
the 19-year-old communist insurgency is finally losing steam and
declared that the rebels' rejection of peace gives her government
``the moral basis for war.''
   ``This may be remembered as the year the insurgency was
broken,'' Mrs. Aquino told Congress in a nationally televised
``state of the nation address''.
   As the president spoke, about 3,000 leftists rallied at a
downtown square about six miles away and burned placards showing
her wearing military fatigues.
   Speakers claimed the government had failed to live up to its
promises of land reform and social justice.
   ``For the armed left, it has been a year of defeats and
retreats; a year of propaganda by terror rather than the strategic
initiative of which it had boasted,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   She made no direct reference to a call this month by the
Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines to resume peace
talks, which collapsed in January 1987.
   The president vowed her government would keep open ``the door of
reconciliation'' but added: ``The rejection of our peace efforts
restored to government the moral basis for war.
   ``I wish we could still pursue the path of peace,'' she added.
``Yet, until the (rebels) and their friends come to trust their
doctrines to the ballot box rather than the (rifle), government has
no choice but to defend our people with the gun.''
   Last week, Mrs. Aquino said she was willing to resume peace
talks but only if the rebels request them first. The general
command of the 25,000-member New People's Army rejected the call,
saying the government simply wants to entrap guerrilla leaders.
   During the address, Mrs. Aquino said democracy ``is beating back
the challenge of the totalitarian left.''
   She called on Congress to pursue an agenda to alleviate foreign
debt, improve education, create new jobs and reduce poverty.
   Mrs. Aquino claimed that in the past year, government troops
captured five members of the Communist party central committee, 19
staff officers, 397 regulars and killed about 2,000 party members.
   The leftist People's Party, in a statement issued before the
speech, said the president's remarks were simply ``an apology to
the nation.
   ``The real state of the nation is lived with each passing day,''
the party said. ``It is experienced by each hungry family; it is
witnessed by each hungry family; it is witnessed by each
negotiation selling out to the U.S. bases; and it is echoed by each
cry of protest that is snuffed out by bullets.''
   Opposition Rep. Salvador Escuerdo said Mrs. Aquino's optimisic
assessment of the counter-insurgency campaign shows she is not
receiving realistic reports from the military.
   ``I'm a bit worried that Mrs. Aquino is not getting the correct
data from her officials in the Department of National Defense,''
Escuerdo said. ``Without peace and order, we cannot really hope for
an economic miracle or recovery.''
   On Saturday, the Philippine Daily Globe said a classified
military report prepared in May showed government forces lost 66 of
the 67 major battles against the New People's Army during the first
three months of the year.
   The newspaper also said the report showed that rebel strength in
Manila had grown to 2,700, the highest number since the insurgency
began in December 1968.
   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo admitted that the
newspaper account was based on an internal, classified report but
said its findings were purely ``tactical'' and incomplete.

   A severe earthquake registering 6.8 on the
Richter scale was detected today in the eastern Banda Sea off
Indonesia, the Royal Hong Kong Observatory reported.
   An observatory said in a statement that the center of the quake
was about 1,816 miles east of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
   A spokesman said the quake was recorded at 2:53 p.m. (2:53 a.m.
EDT) but that no other details were available.
   The Richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake.
Every increase of one digit in the scale represents a 10-fold
increase in intensity.
   An earthquake registering 6 on the scale can cause severe damage
in populated areas.

   Gretchen Schulte has gone the way of many
disgruntled workers, declaring a strike, a picket line and erecting
protest placards against unfair labor practices.
   Cooking, cleaning, laundry, sewing and driving her children to
summer activities were among the tasks she refused to do during her
walkout, which appears to be entering its second week today.
   Mrs. Schulte, 42, said she's protesting her motherly duties
because she felt she was being taken for granted.
   Her husband, Theodore, pitched in and helped her with the signs
that were draped on the front porch.
   The family could not be reached Sunday by telephone, but the
protest placards were still in view and Mrs. Schulte said Saturday
during an interview she would pursue her walkout at least through a
second week.
   Neighbors said the Schultes appeared to be away for the day,
leading to speculation that some heavy collective bargaining might
be going on.
   Hand-painted signs on the front of the frame dwelling read:
``Mom On Strike'' and ``Union + Labor = Teenagers.''
   ``I don't expect it to change overnight,'' Mrs. Schulte said
Saturday. ``I'm going to last another week, but if it goes another
month I don't really care.''
   A cardboard fence marked a picket line, serving notice to her
four children to use the back door.
   ``I became too much of a mother, too much of a chauffeur,'' she
said. ``I just began doing too much for them and they weren't
giving me anything.'' There was constant squabbling about making
beds and doing dishes, she said.
   ``I said I don't have enough money to go to a counselor, and
these things are too small anyway, but if I let them go, I'm going
to have a lot of problems,'' she said.
   She and her husband made signs that were posted inside the
house. When the children only ``thought it was cool,'' she decided
to go public.
   The campaign began July 18 with no meals, no money from mother's
pocket for milk and no rides to work. Their telephone was
disconnected. Television and radio were taken to ``strike
headquarters'' in the parents' bedroom.
   No teen-ager friends were allowed to cross the picket line.
   Schulte said he supported his wife 100 percent and was acting as
strike mediator.
   The children, twins Heidi and Eric, 14; Julie, 13, and Jerry, 8,
gave the strike mixed reviews.
   ``I feel embarrassed because everyone is asking me about it,''
Heidi said, ``but we're going to have to make a change because we
don't want her on strike anymore. She has a point, but I think she
went about it the wrong way.''
   Jerry, who promised to spend an afternoon making his bed and
cleaning his room, the living room and the bathroom, said: ``Some
people are saying good for Mom.''
   ``I say good for Mom, too.''
   By the weekend, Mrs. Schulte reported progress but that talks
had yet to produce a settlement.
   ``I love them,'' Mrs. Schulte said of her children. ``I just
want them to look at themselves and see that they don't have it so
tough at my house. When they start doing these things, I'll go off
strike.''
   Meanwhile, she said, ``I'm having the time of my life.''

   Vietnam, which once called the situation
in Cambodia ``irreversible,'' held its first peace talks today with
leaders of three guerrilla groups fighting its decade-old
occupation of that country.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam searched for
compromise in an opulent reception room at the late President
Sukarno's summer palace with the guerrilla leaders and foreign
ministers of non-communist nations that back them.
   The informal ``cocktail party'' talks weren't confirmed until
the last minute, but they have raised hopes for ending a monotonous
cycle of dashed diplomatic moves followed by bloody fighting in
Cambodia's malarial jungles.
   Vietnam maintains more than 100,000 troops in Cambodia to
support a government it installed after invading the country on
Christmas Day, 1978.
   Around tables arranged in a circle sat Thach; Hun Sen, prime
minister of the Vietnamese-installed government; a representative
of Vietnam's communist ally, Laos; and the guerrilla leaders: Khieu
Samphan of the communist Khmer Rouge, Son Sann of the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
who is representing his father, prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The guerrillas are grouped in a resistance coalition that the
United Nations recognizes as Cambodia's legitimate government.
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of host Indonesia moderated the
talks, also attended by senior foreign ministry officials of the
other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations:
Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Brunei.
   The association has called Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia the
region's major security threat during the past decade.
   The parties all sat quietly in the carpeted, double-chandeliered
room as waves of journalists and photographers were rushed in for a
glimpse. Thach appeared bemused, and the affable Alatas chatted and
tried to ease some of the stiffness of the first encounter.
   No definite schedule has been fixed for the duration of the
talks.
   For years, Thach was a tough hardliner who knew only the
language of defiance. Over the past 1{ years, however, he has
vigorously pushed for dialogue as Vietnam's pragmatic new
leadership focuses on economic development, which it admits
requires an end to the international isolation Cambodia has caused
Hanoi.
   For years, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has
encouraged the guerrillas to force Vietnam out of Cambodia.
   The association became more anxious for talks as Vietnam began
withdrawing large numbers of troops and pledged a total pullout by
early 1990, suggesting it fears the pullout may leave Cambodia with
a much more chaotic and bloodier civil war.
   Earlier today, the Cambodian factions held their own separate
talks, the first time they had ever gathered together.
   Alatas has outlined the formidable task the parties face: they
have to find common ground on power-sharing, self-determination,
national reconciliation, the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and
Cambodia's future.
   Hun Senn and Sihanouk have held two rounds of talks without
success in the past, and today's gathering represented the first
meeting among all four Cambodia parties.
   Sihanouk, meanwhile, was visiting Jakarta, the Indonesian
capital just 40 miles from Bogor, but had no known plans to attend
the talks. An Indonesian source said the former Cambodian monarch
might make an appearance in Bogor, depending on progress in the
talks.
   Earlier this month, Sihanouk resigned as president of the
guerrilla coalition, charging the Khmer Rouge was killing his men.
   The talks are based on a July 1987 Vietnam-Indonesia agreement
that calls for informal discussions to encourage the various
antagonists to participate and allay Vietnam's refusal to negotiate
directly with the guerrillas.
   Disputes between Vietnam and Association of Southeast Asian
Nations delayed the talks, which were not confirmed until the last
minute. The association includes the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei,
Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.
   Since 1970, Cambodia has suffered a devastating five-year civil
war, a reign of terror by the Chinese-backed Communist Khmer Rouge
from 1975 to 1978, a 1978 Vietnamese invasion and a continuing
guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed government.
   Millions of people have been killed in the turmoil.
   Vietnam has announced it will withdraw 50,000 troops, or about
half its force in Cambodia, this year and the rest by early 1990.
   Though Son Sann and Sihanouk are allied with the Khmer Rouge in
a resistance coalition, they strongly distrust the Khmer Rouge
because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled
Cambodia.

<TEXT>
   Parties that formed Prime Minister Prem
Tinsulanonda's last coalition government won 58 percent of the vote
in a general election, but analysts predicted today that Prem's
probable return to power will be beset by discord.
   ``The new government will face the same difficult problems it
endured under Prem's last administration because there is growing
and open resentment of and opposition to Prem,'' said political
scientist Somboon Suksamran of Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.
   Since no pro-Prem party scored a majority in Sunday's polling,
the next government will again have to be made up of several
parties. In Prem's last government, frictions among coalition
partners proved troublesome.
   Somboon and other political analysts predicted that Prem, if he
is returned to power, probably would not finish his four-year term
without dissolving parliament or stepping down.
   Prem has served as prime minister since 1980, having dissolved
parliament twice, survived two attempted coups and formed five
different cabinets.
   A host of domestic pressures have been mounting, including
weakened support from the powerful military, sharp criticism from
opposition parties and recent labor and student protests.
   ``These pressures will only get more intense and will very
likely force Prem to make big decisions on whether he should cling
to his office,'' Somboon told The Associated Press.
   But the head of Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party, which polled the
most votes in the country's 17th general election, said his party
would support Prem's continuation as prime minister.
   Chatichai Choonhavan told reporters today that a ``gentlemen's
agreement'' had been made among the four coalition partners to back
Prem.
   The well-financed Chart Thai won 87 seats in the 357-seat House
of Representatives while coalition partners accumulated another
123. The Social Action Party took 54; Democrat Party, 48; and
Rassadorn (Citizens) Party 21 seats.
   The strongest parties and other power centers in Thailand in
coming days are expected to engage in intense politicking and
bargaining before the next coalition is forged and a prime minister
named.
   The candidate who emerges must also be approved by Thailand's
powerful constitutional monarch, Bhumibol Adulyadej.
   Interior Minister Prachuab Soontrangkul announced that 16.9
million out of an eligible 26.6 million voters turned out for the
election.
   The voting was marred by a grenade attack against a local
politician in which two persons were killed and six others wounded.
   Officials also said Moslem separatists set fire to nine rural
schools, a health clinic and a rest house in the southern province
of Narathiwat in an apparent attempt to disrupt the elections. Some
of the schools were used as polling stations.
   A total of 3,606 candidates from 16 political parties contested
the seats in the lower house of Parliament.
   Among the opposition groups, the Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizens)
Party led with 31 seats and the newly formed Palang Dharma (The
Power of Virtue) captured 14.
   Prem called the election 24 months early after he dissolved
parliament April 29, disbanding his coalition government and
nullifying a no-confidence motion tabled by his increasingly vocal
opposition.
   The 67-year-old former army chief has maintained silence over
whether he would accept another term, but most analysts believe he
would.
   Thai elections are largely centered on personalities, not
political platforms, and the main contention has been whether Prem
should return or not.
   Some people call the low-key prime minister ``Papa Prem;''
others criticize him as ``boring,'' quick to compromise and slow to
tackle national problems.
   But Prem, the longest-serving prime minister in modern Thai
history, has given the country a needed stability after years of
coups and attempted power grabs.
   Although his coalition has been beset by factionalism, he
remains favored by three powerful institutions: the military,
bureaucracy and constitutional monarchy.

<TEXT>
   South Korea's rival political parties
agreed today to present a unified response to North Korea's call
last week for joint parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact.
   Representatives of the south's four political parties met at the
National Assembly and agreed to send by Aug. 1 a letter responding
to the call.
   Party officials said the groups would continue talks this week
to solve minor differences over details such as the agenda and the
site for the talks.
   ``There were no striking differences, although no agreement was
reached,'' said an aide to National Assembly Speaker Kim Jai-soon,
who presided over today's meeting.
   South Korea's political parties have been engaged in talks since
deciding on Friday to consider the North Korean proposal.
   South Korean government officials have been reluctant to agree
to immediate full-scale parliamentary talks, saying preliminary
negotiations are needed for such conferences.
   The two Koreas, divided since 1945, have been locked in a
struggle for supremacy on the divided peninsula. The north has
refused to accept recent South Korean proposals on easing tension.

   The dollar dropped sharply, then bounced back most
of the way today in Tokyo for a net loss of 0.28 yen, while stocks
slipped moderately lower.
   The U.S. currency ranged 1.65 yen between its high and low for
the day, despite a lack of market-affecting news, traders said.
   ``Some participants, especially investment trusts, saw the
dollar's decline in New York last Friday ad began selling dollars
in the morning, expecting it to go lower,'' said Masaharu Takenaka
of the Bank of Tokyo. ``But the market didn't go along with them.''
   He said participants in the afternoon found themselves in
dollar-short positions, and began buying back the U.S. currency.
   The dollar opened at 130.85 yen, down 1.23 yen from Friday's
close of 132.08 yen, and fell during the morning to as low as
130.20 yen. It recovered to as high as 131.85 yen before closing at
131.80 yen, down 0.28 yen. Spot volume was estimated at $7.7
billion.
   On Friday, the dollar closed in New York at 130.84 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
dropped 117.81 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish the day's trading
at 27,183.53.
   Volume on the market's first section was a light 650 million
shares.
   Traders said many participants stayed on the sidelines because
of uncertainty in the foreign exchange market and the upcoming
release of U.S. gross national product figures, expected Wednesday.
   The Nikkei index initially gained about 70 points, but retreated
in the late morning.
   ``Depending on which direction the yen-dollar rate heads from
the current 130-yen level, investors will start moving one way or
the other,'' said Keiichi Nishida of Kidder Peabody.
   Traders said wild fluctuations in the market last week also had
scared off some private investors. The Nikkei index plunged more
than 600 points in last week's trading.

   Bus crashes in two states took the life of one woman and injured
69 passengers, with the driver of one being charged with reckless
driving and the other being praised for stopping his skidding bus
from plunging into a ravine.
   A Colonial Trailways bus en route from Mobile to New York on
Sunday swerved to avoid a car apparently driving on the wrong side
of a two-lane Alabama highway.
   The bus skidded for about 30 feet after it overturned and came
to a stop with the back of the bus in a shallow part of the ravine
and the front jutting about 15 feet in the air.
   The accident, three miles south of Camden in southwestern
Alabama, killed Rosie Gulley, 68, of Brooklyn, N.Y., according to
Alabama troopers, and left 34 other people injured.
   In Edison, N.J., a charter bus driver was charged with reckless
driving after his bus crashed into a bridge abutment, shearing off
most of the roof and injuring 35 passengers who had just left a
family reunion. One was still in critical condition this morning.
   Edison Police Sgt. Bill Bunting said the bus, which originated
in Virginia, struck the abutment of a railroad bridge Sunday
afternoon. The bus carried 46 passengers and the driver, Bunting
said.
   The driver, 43-year-old Sherman Lassiter of Suffolk, Va., was
issued a summons for careless driving, Bunting said. Lassiter, a
driver for United Coach Corp. of Suffolk, failed to observe a sign
warning of low bridge clearance and was driving above the speed
limit, he said.
   State Police Capt. George Jones said the driver of the bus
involved in the Alabama accident said he had swerved to avoid an
oncoming car. Jones said that was under investigation.
   State police spokesman Will Rogers said the bus was carrying 34
passengers and the bus driver. Four people were hospitalized
overnight for observation.
   Passenger Stephen White, a Marine sergeant, credited the driver
for keeping the bus from plunging into the ravine.
   ``I thought the driver did an outstanding job in the way he
handled the bus,'' White said. ``It might have been a lot worse for
us.''

<TEXT>
   The spiritual leader of pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem extremists believed to be holding foreigners hostage
in Lebanon has called for a new approach to the crisis that would
bring a ``happy ending.''
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, made the comments in a sermon Sunday as
Iran prepared to enter U.N.-sponsored talks to end its 8-year-old
war with Iraq.
   Fadlallah accused the United States and Europe of using the
hostage crisis for political purposes. But he also called for a
swift resolution to the problem.
   ``We call for a just and practical solution to ths problem to
achieve a happy ending,'' he said.
   ``We are aware that the (hostages) problem has reached such a
degree of complexity that its political aspect has become mixed up
with its humanitarian aspect.''
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for Shiite factions
holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon. Nine
Americans are among the captives.
   Fadlallah's comments came during a one-hour sermon to Shiites
marking the major Moslem feast of al-Adha in south Beirut's Bir
el-Abed mosque.
   The hostages are widely believed to be held in Hezbollah's Hay
Madi barracks building about 10 blocks from the mosque in Beirut's
southern suburbs.
   Syria has had some 5,000 troops patrolling most of the southern
suburbs since May 27, but they have stayed away from the immediate
area of the barracks apparently to avert a military confrontation
that could imperil the hostages.
   Syrian soldiers, however, control all approaches to Hay Madi and
man high-rise apartment buildings overlooking the barracks.
   It was not clear whether Fadlallah's call signaled a
breakthrough for the hostages. He has made similar statements in
the past two years with no results.
   ``On the occasion of this feast, we call on all sides to begin
acting in a political sphere so that the humanitarian aspect of
this problem could be resolved,'' he said.
   ``We feel pain for the detention (of the hostages) because the
issue has humanitarian aspects,'' Fadlallah said.
   He accused the United States and European nations of
``manipulating the issue of the hostages for political reasons to
impose their dominance on the world.
   ``America has not moved to fight terrorism but has rather used
it as a means of political pressure on each country and people that
resist its imperlialist policies,'' he added.
   It was Fadlallah's first reference to the hostages issue since
Iran announced July 18 that it was accepting the year-old U.N.
Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in its war
with Iraq.
   Political observers believe a truce could facilitate efforts for
the release of the hostages.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, appearing on the NBC's
``Meet the Press,'' said Sunday that improved U.S.-Iranian
relations could lead to the release of the American hostages.
   On the terms of a release, Carlucci said, ``We're obviously not
going to discuss any quid pro quo, but if the Iranians want to talk
to us about the hostage situation and how they're going to go about
influencing their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about
it. I'm not in the slightest suggesting that there would be any
deal for the hostages. That is contrary to our policy.''
   ``We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into a
dialogue with Iran,'' Carlucci said. ``All they have to do is
designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and
we'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, about
terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever is
appropriate.''
   The longest held hostages is Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle
Eeast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was seized March
16, 1985.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, reached by telephone Sunday at her
home in Cadiz, Ky., said, ``I don't see that it (the holding of
hostages) should be a political issue. It's a human issue.
   ``Everything I've been hearing out of the Middle East lately
gives us reason to hope and it's been a very, very long time since
we've had occasion to be hopeful.''

   The owner of a 40-pound pet piglet that
eluded police for three hours until it paused for a handful of
horse feed was told his porker may be killed if it isn't picked up
within five days.
   But Blackie's owner, David Allen Brown, 32, will be in the
Hillsborough County Jail until at least Aug. 5, when he's scheduled
to appear before a judge on a parole violation charge, his mother
said.
   Brown was notified Saturday that the 8-month-old pig will be
``terminated'' if it isn't claimed in five days, said his mother,
Dorothy Brown.
   She said she would take the pig into her suburban home, but
``you know what the neighbors would say.''
   She's hoping some farmer will come to the porker's rescue.
   Blackie's brush with the law began Thursday when police stopped
Brown and a computer check showed he was wanted for violating
probation on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol.
   Blackie slipped out of Brown's arms and made a clean getaway.
Officer Gary Yost and another officer spent the next few hours
pursuing Blackie until a member of the Sheriff's Office
agricultural unit was called in for assistance.
   Deputy Jack ``Hi-Ho'' Hrabovsky used a handful of horse feed to
stop and capture Blackie, who was sent off to a Sheriff's Office
facility.
   Sheriff's Office spokesman Jack Espinosa said he was not sure
what the guidelines on animals called for, but he noted that in
many livestock cases, the animals were kept for a specific time and
then auctioned.
   ``The last thing I heard ... was that this was a pet, that we
have his pet and that we would keep the pig until it is claimed,''
he said.
   Brown's mother said her son, who has always liked pigs, received
Blackie from a friend as payment for a plumbing job. She said he
intended to give the pig to relatives who live on a farm.

<HEAD>Soviet Officer Predicts Collapse of Afghan Government</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS one graf to update with report on casualties since

   A Soviet general says he doubts Afghan troops can
survive when the Red Army withdraws from Afghanistan. He also
predicts that Islamic fundamentalists will seize power.
   The statements by Maj. Gen. Kim M. Tsagolov, who was once an
adviser to the Afghans, represent a break with Moscow's official
line.
   In an interview with the weekly Ogonyok magazine, Tsagolov says
Afghanistan's ruling party is hopelessly disorganized, plagued by
corruption and has bungled opportunities to make peace with
insurgents. He also accuses the Soviet media of exaggerating Soviet
and Afghan military victories.
   The interview appeared in the magazine's July 30 issue, which
subscribers received Sunday.
   Western military and political analysts have said for some time
they doubt the Afghan army can fight off U.S.-backed rebels on its
own. They have predicted a collapse of the communist Afghan
government in Kabul after the Soviet pullout is completed next year.
   Tsagolov, who teaches philosophy at a military academy, is
believed to be the first Soviet official to make similar
predictions publicly.
   Ogonyok has led the campaign for glasnost, or greater openness,
on selected topics.
   The official Soviet line has held that Afghan government forces
are well prepared to defend their country. Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov,
commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan, told reporters in Moscow
last month that the Afghan government has created an effective
fighting force.
   Asked if he is confident Afghan forces can provide adequate
defense from rebel attacks after a Soviet withdrawal, Tsagolov told
Ogonyok: ``If you judge the Afghan army by its current state, then
I don't have the confidence about which you speak.''
   The Soviet Union began withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan
May 15. Under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord, half of the more
than 100,000 troops must be out by mid-August and the rest by Feb.
15.
   The official Tass news agency said Saturday that more than
35,000 soldiers have been withdrawn. Meanwhile, Kabul is coming
under increasing guerrilla artillery fire.
   President Najib of Afghanistan says he is counting on the
continued help of Soviet advisers for his 50,000 regular army
troops after the Kremlin's forces are gone. He has said his forces
can defend the country as long as outside assistance to the rebels
is stopped.
   Tsagolov noted that Afghan forces, even when backed by Soviet
troops, have made little headway in capturing rebel-held territory.
He said official Soviet press reports exaggerated military
victories and suffered from a ``deficit of truth'' about how tough
the combat was.
   The Aghan army is weak, he said, because the ruling People's
Democratic Party and the government lack popular support and have
underestimated the threat of the armed opposition. He recommended
the government devote massive resources to building up the army.
   Asked what the situation would be like when the Soviet
withdrawal is completed, he predicted ``activization of the Islamic
factor.''
   ``In the future, it's quite possible that Islamic
fundamentalists will appear,'' he said.
   Some Afghan guerrillas want to establish an Islamic
fundamentalist state.
   Tsagolov said the Afghan leadership had been insensitive to
religion and thereby alienated much of the population, drawing them
to the opposition.
   He said Najib's policy of national reconciliation, an attempt to
bring opponents into the government, has failed even though
internal opponents are tired of war, willing to engage in dialogue
and hostile to the seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance based in
Pakistan.
   ``This also can be considered a lost opportunity of the Kabul
leadership,'' Tsagolov said.
   He said the ruling Afghan party is split into factions, pays
little attention to people's needs and is plagued by bureaucracy
and bribery.
   ``I fear that the disease of fractional battle and system of
clans in the party has gone too far,'' Tsagolov said.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
Soviet-backed Kabul government fight the rebels.
   The Kremlin says 13,310 Soviet soldiers have been killed in the
war, 35,500 have been wounded and more than 300 are missing in
action.
   Tass reported today that since May rebel forces have bombarded
Kabul with 178 rockets and 30 mines, killing 154 people and
wounding 205 in the Afghan capital.

<HEAD>Official Says Sub Crew Should Have Done More to Rescue Boat
Passengers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top defense official said today that the crew of
a navy submarine that hit and sank a chartered fishing boat should
have done more to rescue the 48 people on board and had been slow
in notifying rescue officials.
   Divers, meanwhile, recovered the bodies of three more victims,
bringing the confirmed death toll to nine in the accident Saturday
near Yokosuka, 28 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   About 200 divers were searching today for the bodies of 21
people missing and presumed dead, rescue officials said. Other
divers worked to attach cables to the hull of the sunken fishing
vessel, the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru. Officials said they plan to
begin raising the ship with a giant crane Tuesday.
   Witnesses said the fishing boat, which had been chartered by a
company club for a weekend trip, sank less than two minutes after
colliding with the 2,200-ton submarine Nadashio at the entrance to
Tokyo Bay. The submarine, traveling on the surface, was crossing a
busy shipping lane to enter Yokosuka naval base.
   Nineteen people were rescued from the boat. One of them died
later in a hospital.
   ``The investigation isn't complete yet, but it looks like both
vessels were partly responsible for the accident,'' an official of
the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard, said.
   There were no reports of injuries among the 75 men aboard the
submarine, which was only slightly damaged.
   Seiki Nishihiro, vice minister of state for defense, said the
submarine had been slow in notifying rescue officials of the
accident because its communications equipment allowed it to talk to
naval headquarters, but not directly to the coast guard.
   News reports said 21 minutes elapsed before the coast guard was
informed of the collision. Of the 19 people who were rescued, 16
were picked up by other passing ships and only three by the
submarine, the reports said.
   Nishihiro said he wished members of the crew ``had grabbed three
or four life preservers, if they were available, and jumped into
the water'' to save the people in the ocean.
   Witnesses from other boats said they saw a number of people who
had been floating in the water after the accident sink out of sight.
   Admiral Shuichiro Higashiyama, navy chief of staff, was quoted
as saying Sunday that the submarine was trying to avoid hitting a
yacht when it rammed the fishing boat, and that the accident could
have been avoided if the fishing boat had not made an unexpected
turn.
   ``If the No. 1 Fujimaru had not turned to the left, there would
not have been a collision. I don't know why they turned. I believe
the submarine commander took the most appropriate measures to avoid
an accident,'' a navy official quoted him as saying.
   According to Japanese maritime regulations, the vessel
approaching from the left when two boats are on a collision course
must take evasive action, while the other vessel must maintain its
direction unless an accident is imminent.
   In Saturday's accident, the submarine was on the left,
Higashiyama said.
   The collision was the worst involving Japanese navy vessels and
civilian boats since World War II, defense officials said. It was
the first collision in Japan between a submarine and a Japanese
civilian ship since 1981, when a U.S. nuclear submarine hit a
freighter, killing two people, the Kyodo News Service said.

   Progress has found its way to this mountain
community in the form of the first traffic light in Grand County.
   ``It's going to be a shock to some people, but it's very needed
and probably will save someone's life,'' said Vicky Winter, town
clerk.
   The light is scheduled to go up at U.S. 40 and Grand County 72,
the entrance to a shopping center that has created periodic traffic
jams.
   The busy ski resorts of Winter Park and Silver Creek, about 75
miles northwest of Denver, are nearby.
   ``We've had lots of injury accidents at that intersection in the
past three or four years, but fortunately no one has been killed,''
said Richard A. Leonard, a Grand County commissioner.
   ``I would hope we could get it up before winter, but delivery
time for the arms is considerable,'' said Jim Bragdon, a traffic
engineer with the Colorado Department of Highways. ``There's a lot
more work that you would ever realize in a traffic signal.''
   The signal will leave only 18 of Colorado's 63 counties without
traffic lights.

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Full-scale test-firing of experimental
space shuttle engines will begin here in September for the first
time since the initial development program about 20 years ago, NASA
engineering officials said.
   Resumption of the experimental activity will increase morale at
the Marshall Space Flight Center, one engineer said.
   ``We've had a lot of passive tests, structural tests, but there
wasn't any fire and smoke,'' NASA engineer Ron Toopen said last
week. ``You put in a lot of long, hard hours and the results of it
all is that you get to see it here in your own back yard.''
   The tests will look at ``new technology items'' for shuttle
engine improvement, according to Charles Crane, chief of the
advanced engine development branch of the shuttle main engine
office.
   Engineers plan to use a 20-story rocket-testing stand that was
last used almost two decades ago to test-fire Saturn moon rocket
stages.
   The Marshall center, which is responsible for developing and
managing the $40 million main shuttle engines, will use the stand
to fire engines for up to 150 seconds at a time.
   Engineers are seeking ways to make the expensive engines more
economical. The major components of the shuttle's main engines now
are replaced after three or four flights.
   ``These test firings will be a series of prototypes of advanced
engines to see if components can last longer than we think,'' said
John McCarty, chief of Marshall's engineering propulsion lab. If
so, McCarty said, the price of the engines might be reduced to
about $20 million in about 10 years.
   The test firing program will cost about $15 million to $20
million annually. McCarty said there has been little or no test
firing to try new ideas since initial engine development in the
early 1970s.
   ``The way it has been, we've had ideas, done the design work,
then had to go to a launch (at Cape Canaveral, Fla.) to watch it
work,'' Crane said. ``This way it's next door.''

   A West German woman give birth to
sextuplets and the four girls and two boys are in critical
condition, a university hospital spokeswoman said today.
   She said the babies, weighing between 1 pound, 6 ounces and 2
pounds, 2 ounces), have been placed in incubators.
   The sextuplets were born Sunday by Caesarean section operation
in the 27th week of pregnancy, said the hospital spokeswoman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks.
   The spokeswoman declined to provide the names of the parents.
The Hamburg-based Bild newspaper reported the babies were born to
34-year-old Barbara Coenen and her husband Wilhelm, a 36-year-old
construction worker.
   Bild said the couple have two other children and that Mrs.
Coenen had taken fertility drugs.

   Iraq said it captured thousands of enemy
troops in a series of sudden raids into Iran and promised today to
end its invasion just as the two sides were preparing for peace
talks.
   Iraq's announcement, carried on government-run Baghdad radio,
came after Iran claimed it attacked Iraqi forces in southern Iran
early today, forced them to retreat 25 miles and killed or wounded
1,500 Iraqis. The Iranian account could not be independently
confirmed.
   Iraq said it would withdraw from all Iranian territory within a
day. On Sunday, Iraq reported its troops already had left Iran.
   The new reports came as the warring nations' foreign ministers
prepared to meet this week with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar for talks on a cease-fire.
   Exactly one week ago and after a string of battlefield defeats,
Iran abruptly changed its hardline stance and accepted a year-old
U.N. resolution for ending the 8-year-old war between the Persian
Gulf neighbors.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran, who was flying to
New York today, said Iraq's wide-ranging attacks along the war
front threatened a prospective cease-fire.
   On Sunday, a four-member U.N. team arrived in Iran to begin
discussing a key technical elements of a truce: the trade of
prisoners of war. A second U.N. team was scheduled to arrive soon
in the Persian Gulf to work out other details of a cease-fire.
   Interviewed today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Iranian and
Iraqi diplomats charged each other's countries with violating the
spirit of the prospective truce.
   ``At the last minute they want to capture some of our land when
we have already removed the excuse for the Iraqis,'' said Mohammed
Ja'afar Mahallati, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations.
``Unfortunately it has been Iraq that has always sabotaged efforts
of the secretary-general to implement (U.N. Resolution 598).''
   Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the United States,
criticized Iran for waiting a year to accept the U.N. resolution
``and coupled with that, of course, all threats and call for
mobilization and asking the Iranian people to go to the front to
continue the war against what they call the enemy.''
   ``We are interested in lasting, comprehensive peace, not just a
cease-fire to enable the Iranians to mobilize and ... wage another
human offensive whenever they would like,'' he said.
   Supreme Court Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili of Iran said
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had ``doubled his popularity'' by
accepting the cease-fire, Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported today.
   Tehran radio said Khomeini met with a group of visitors who
chanted ``Please God Keep Khomeini Alive'' and ``We Are All Your
Soldiers, We Will Obey Your Orders.''
   The radio said Khomeini responded by waving his hand. He
apparently did not speak.
   Ardebili urged a huge turnout at rallies planned for Aug. 2 to
demonstrate allegiance to Khomeini, the patriarch of Iran's
9-year-old Islamic revolution.
   Iraq already has accepted the U.N. cease-fire resolution, which
calls for return to previous borders and a prisoner exchange.
   According to International Red Cross figures, Iran has about
50,000 Iraqi POWs and Iraq held 13,000 Iranian soldiers before the
latest raid.
   Iraq said Sunday that it had boosted its bargaining position by
seizing 8,636 additional enemy fighters during its push into Iran
that began Friday. President Saddam Hussein has said taking a large
number of prisoners would help in peace negotiations.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said today the Iraqis still
were occupying 1,500 square miles of Iranian soil on the central
front, 190 square miles in the central-southern region and 19
square miles in the south.
   Interviewed Sunday on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,''
Perez de Cuellar said he hoped hostilities would cease when he
began discussions with representatives of the two nations.
   Asked if talks would be held face-to-face, Perez de Cuellar
said: ``My idea is to discuss separately with both sides. Of
course, I will be only too pleased if, at some stage, I could have
the two sides together.''
   Iraq has said it wants to hold direct negotiations. Iran
initially refused, but later indicated it might agree to them at
Perez de Cuellar's request.

<HEAD>Dukakis Has Boston Homecoming; Bush Courts Women With Child-Care
Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 2 grafs with Dukakis cheered on return to
work, picking up in 2nd graf pvs, The Massachusetts</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, back in Boston for the first time since winning
the Democratic nomination, was greeted wuth cheers today when he
walked into his Statehouse office. Republican George Bush,
meanwhile, was getting mixed reviews as he sought to shore up
support among women.
   About 20 workers in the executive chamber cheered and applauded
as Dukakis arrived at work at 8:50 a.m. today. He grinned and bowed
and then spoke briefly to them before heading into his office.
   The Massachusetts governor, returning Sunday night from a
three-day campaign trip, was greeted warmly by about 150 people in
soggy weather at Boston's Logan International Airport.
   Dukakis and his running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, traveled to five
states, including the key fall battlegrounds of California and
Texas. They set off on their initial campaign trip last week, just
after accepting their respective nominations at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta.
   The Republicans, meanwhile, were looking ahead to their own
convention, which opens three weeks from today in New Orleans.
   Bush, the certain GOP nominee, was back in Washington today
after spending five days on the road. His campaigning between now
and the opening of the GOP gathering will be curtailed because he
has spent nearly the legal limit for pre-convention campaigning.
   But the White House said Sunday that President Reagan probably
will campaign in the Midwest on Bush's behalf between now and the
convention. That word came from White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater as Reagan was flying back from California on Air Force
One.
   Also aboard was Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who had
been in California for a weekend fund-raiser, and his presence
fueled new speculation about an imminent departure from the
administration to run Bush's campaign.
   Fitzwater said Baker had ``a very brief chat'' with Reagan and
added: ``He's still treasury secretary, put it that way.''
   When reporters sent Baker a note asking him to come back and
talk to them about the matter, he sent back a dollar bill and
suggested that reporters take a close look at the banknote bearing
his signature.
   ``Please note the title under the signature,'' Baker wrote. That
title, of course, is secretary of the treasury.
   Later, asked by reporters to ``share the news,'' he responded:
``There's no news to share.''
   Baker's status isn't the only source of speculation surrounding
the Bush campaign. The vice president traveled to Albuquerque,
N.M., on Sunday with former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Hanford Dole, who has been mentioned as a potential running mate.
   But campaign manager Lee Atwater said Bush won't reveal his
choice of a running mate until next month in New Orleans.
   ``He's going to keep his own counsel on it, and he's going to
let us all know at the convention,'' Atwater said Sunday in an
interview on the CBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.'' He added that
he thought an announcement then would be ``very exciting and very
dramatic.''
   Bush, in Albuquerque to speak to an organization of professional
and business women, unveiled an ambitious $2.2 billion child-care
plan that would be phased in over four years. The group's
president, Beth Wray, welcomed the plan but tempered her praise by
calling it ``one of his first concrete gestures'' toward women.
   When Bush finished speaking, many in the audience broke into
chants of ``E-R-A'' _ a reference to the Equal Rights Amendment,
which the vice president opposes. He also was presented with a red
purse, which organization members said signified the gap between
the earnings of women and men.
   On another front, Bush said in an interview published in Newsday
on Sunday that he would consider the creation of an international
military force that could launch air strikes against foreign drug
factories.
   ``If you can target a factory that was putting out this poison
... a factory of death ... that's poisoning kids, where a country
needed assistance to wipe it out, I'd be very open-minded about
that (air strikes). We're talking about a war on drugs,'' he said
in the interview.
   ``We have helicopters going in there right now, striking against
crops,'' Bush said. ``What's so different?''
   Bush's former chief of staff, retired Adm. Daniel Murphy, raised
the idea at a congressional hearing July 14. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., at the time called the suggestion ``pap and nonsense.''
   Dukakis, for his part, encountered anti-abortion protesters at a
stop in St. Louis on Sunday, as he had a day earlier in Modesto,
Calif. The governor supports a woman's right to an abortion.
   In St. Louis, Dukakis and Bentsen were introduced by Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a onetime rival for the Democratic
nomination. Gephardt accompanied them to the church he had attended
since childhood.
   Later, the two made a stop in Erie, Pa., where Dukakis continued
to stress the theme of economic opportunity and commitment to the
family.
   After the Pennsylvania stop, Bentsen returned to Washington. He
was expected to campaign on his own later this week.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today shot and killed a former army
officer who escaped from prison while serving a life sentence in
the assassination of President Anwar Sadat, the government
announced.
   Essam el-Kemary, 37, a former major, was killed in a hail of
gunfire when police attacked an apartment he and two other
fugitives used as a hideout, an Interior Ministry statement said.
   Two police officers were wounded when the police gunfire was
returned with a volley of bullets and explosive charges from the
hideout. Both officers were reported in satisfactory condition in a
hospital, the ministry statement said.
   It was not clear whether the two other fugitives _ Mohammed
Khamis, 40, and Ahmed el-Aswani, 31 _ escaped before police stormed
the apartment in Cairo's el-Sharabiya district.
   In the apartment, the ministry said, police found plastic bombs.
   A ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
security forces were searching for the two other fugitives.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
el-Kemary was ``by far the most dangerous'' of the three escapees.
   The dawn attack ended a nationwide manhunt that the Interior
Ministry launched after el-Kemary and the two others, also serving
life sentences in Sadat's killing, escaped July 17 from the
maximum-security Tura jail on the outskirts of Cairo.
   In the dawn jailbreak, the three men forced open their prison
cell with an iron bar and overpowered the guards, seizing their
rifles and knocking one man unconscious. The fugitives then shot
their way out of the prison to a getaway car, police said.
   According to the government, the three men were members of a
Moslem fundamentalist group known as Jihad, or Holy War. Jihad was
blamed for Sadat's slaying at a military parade on Oct. 6, 1981,
and a subsequent coup attempt.
   Sadat's assassination sparked a security crackdown on Moslem
extremists. After a series of trials, three convicted assassins
were executed by firing squad, another two were hanged and more
than 120 men were given prison terms up to life.
   El-Kemary, Khamis and el-Aswani were convicted of planning the
assassination and the coup attempt, in addition to membership in an
armed group _ Jihad _ trying to disrupt the public order. The three
did not actually shoot at Sadat.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Michael Dukakis returned to state business today
after winding up his first campaign swing as the Democratic
presidential nominee by declaring his party the ``party of jobs ...
the party of families.''
   Staff members and other workers cheered and applauded as he
walked into the executive chamber at the Massachusetts Statehouse
today. The governor grinned, bowed and then talked briefly with the
group before going into his office.
   He was greeted by about 150 supporters who chanted ``Let's Go
Mike'' at Logan International Airport late Sunday as he arrived
home for the first time since claiming the Democratic banner last
week in Atlanta.
   He concluded a spirited three-day, cross-country series of
campaign appearances with running mate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
on Sunday by attacking Reagan administration economic policies.
   ``We're going to win because we are the party of jobs,'' he told
a rally at the last stop in Erie, Pa. ``We're going to win, my
friends, because we're the party of families.''
   Bentsen, who touted his new alliance with Dukakis on the
five-state swing from Texas to California and back to the East,
returned to Washington and planned to resume campaigning on his own
in a few days.
   Dukakis was dogged by anti-abortion demonstrators throughout the
day, beginning with a Sunday church service in St. Louis where
about 100 people protested his support of a woman's right to an
abortion. Later in Erie, his route away from the airport was lined
with nearly as many anti-abortion protesters.
   In Erie, Dukakis appeared with Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey in
a downtown park where 4,000 to 5,000 people gathered on a hot and
sunny afternoon. Citing the decline in steel industry jobs in the
region, Dukakis declared, ``We can turn things around, and we're
going to do it.''
   ``It's time to exchange voodoo for can-do,'' he said. ``It's
time to exchange trickle-down for building up in this country, and
we're going to do it.''
   In St. Louis, Dukakis went to services and spoke from the pulpit
of the Third Baptist Church with Bentsen and former party rival
Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   As they entered the downtown church, about 100 anti-abortion
demonstrators across the street held up signs and chanted, ``Hey
Mike, how many babies did you kill today?''
   Dukakis did not acknowledge the protesters but later told
reporters his position on abortion has been consistent for 25 years.
   ``It's a difficult, very serious, very important ethical and
moral judgment,'' Dukakis said at a news conference inside the
church building. ``But in my judgment it is a woman, in the
exercise of her conscience and religious beliefs, that has to make
that judgment.
   ``The question is who makes the decision, and do we go back to
the days when we branded a woman a criminal for making that
decision,'' he added. ``I believe the vast majority of Americans
don't want to go back to those days. They think in the last
analysis this is an issue of conscience.''
   Dukakis went to the church to underscore a fundamental theme of
his campaign i recent days, the commitment to family and community
that he spoke of in his speech Thursday accepting his party's
nomination.
   ``The most important thing in my life is family,'' Dukakis told
the congregation.
   ``They are our anchors. They are the place in which we get our
strength. It was our parents that gave us our sense of values,
sense of ethics, our sense of morality,'' he said.
   Bentsen, more conservative on many issues than Dukakis, did not
face questioning on the abortion issue. However, spokesman Jack
DeVore said Bentsen opposes federal funding for abortion except in
cases of rape, incest or when a mother's life is endangered by the
pregnancy.

   John Goss, campaign manager for Frank L.
O'Bannon, the Indiana Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor,
probably wondered if he would ever get back from the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta.
   Goss was riding home with O'Bannon and O'Bannon's wife, Judy, in
the couple's van when he slipped into the back of the van and fell
asleep.
   South of Chattanooga, Tenn., the O'Bannons pulled over at a rest
stop and stepped out quietly so as not to awaken Goss. While they
were in the restrooms, Goss awoke and also decided to visit the
facilities.
   When he returned, the van was gone.
   About 80 miles up the interstate, the O'Bannon's changed drivers
and discovered their passenger was missing.
   ``You don't see how you can miss each other, going into a
one-room thing like that,'' said O'Bannon.
   A call to Georgia state police produced the number of the rest
area. Goss was tracked down. He then hitched a ride up the road to
where the O'Bannons had stopped.
   ``We laughed all the way home,'' O'Bannon said Saturday.

<HEAD>Vanderbilt Tried To Talk Son Out Of Jumping</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heiress and designer Gloria Vanderbilt was
trying to talk her despondent son out of killing himself when he
jumped from a ledge at her 14th floor apartment and fell to his
death, police said today.
   Carter Cooper, 23, had been under treatment for depression over
the past six months. Friends speculated his depression was the
result of a break-up with a girlfriend.
   Police said Cooper, a 1987 Princeton graduate and a writer and
editor at the Public Interest in Washington and American Heritage
in New York, had gone to his mother's home on the Upper East Side
for lunch Friday.
   Ms. Vanderbilt told police her son arrived depressed and went
upstairs after lunch to lie down.
   ``A few hours later she went to check on him and she found him
sitting on a ledge,'' said Officer Hugh Barry.
   Barry said Ms. Vanderbilt was pleading with her son not to jump
when he suddenly pushed himself off.
   ``The case is considered virtually closed,'' said Sgt. Diane
Kubler.
   Toxicological tests were performed to determine if drugs or
alcohol were in his system when he died. The results will take
several days.
   ``I had a very high regard for his intelligence and his literary
skill,'' said Norman Podhoretz, editor of Commentary magazine and a
columnist at the New York Post. Cooper had a piece published in
Commentary, a neo-conservative magazine published by the American
Jewish Committee, while he was a student.
   Ms. Vanderbilt, dubbed the ``poor little rich girl'' when she
became the focus of a heated custody battle in the 1930s, was in
seclusion and under a doctor's care, police said. She has three
remaining sons.
   Ms. Vanderbilt, 64, is a great-great-granddaughter of railroad
and shipping magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt.
   Cooper's father was Ms. Vanderbilt's fourth husband, writer
Wyatt Cooper, who died in 1978.

<TEXT>
   Assailants shot and killed a
Belfast member of the IRA's political wing today as Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York, delivering a sermon a mile away, denounced
Americans who ``romanticize violence'' in Ireland.
   Brendan Davidson, 33, was shot in the head as he answered a
knock at his door from three men who apparently were dressed as
policemen, police said.
   Davidson belonged to Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, and was wounded in an assassination
attempt last year. Sinn Fein blamed Protestant extremists for his
killing.
   On Saturday, an IRA bomb killed a Protestant couple and their
6-year-old son as they were driving just north of the
Ireland-Northern Ireland border.
   The mostly Roman Catholic IRA, fighting to drive Britain out of
Northern Ireland and unite the island, has accepted responsibility,
saying it attacked the wrong car. Press reports say the intended
victim was a Northern Ireland judge.
   Davidson was shot at his home on Friendly Street as O'Connor,
leading a American peace pilgrims on a tour of Ireland, was
attending Mass with 400 congregants at St. Peter's Church in the
heart of Catholic West Belfast.
   O'Connor was told of Davidson's killing as he left Belfast.
Several hours later, the cardinal deplored the assassination in his
sermon to an ecumenical service at St. Patrick's Cathedral in
Armagh.
   He said the killing, along with Saturday's bombing, ``poignantly
brought into focus the stupidity, the irrationality of the cycle of
the violence ... Where can this conceivably end? How this can
conceivably please almighty God?''
   In Belfast, O'Connor criticized ``some on our own shores, some
in my own country, who romanticize violence when it is several
thousand miles away, who don't know what it does to a land, who
don't know the insecurity that it brings, who don't know how it
keeps a people oppressed.''
   The Catholic prelate developed the theme in Armagh, criticizing
Americans who ``continue to perpetuate the myth that this violence
reflects the glory of Ireland, that we can stand around pianos and
sing sentimental songs and believe that what occurs today is in the
tradition of the martyrs and the saints.
   ``Isn't it time that we dispelled such myths? Isn't it time that
we... recognized that in the sight of almighty God, a Protestant, a
Catholic, a Jew, a Moslem, a Buddhist, is a person of sacred
worth?''
   O'Connor urged Americans to heed his host in Belfast, Bishop
Cahal Daly, who ``has recognized that regardless of the motive or
the alleged motive, violence, the murder of the innocent, is
absolutely intolerably evil and can never be justified.''
   The cardinal also backed Daly's call to the British government
for more funding to combat unemployment.
   St. Peter's Cathedral in Belfast overlooks the Divis Flats
housing project, which O'Connor toured Sunday. He urged American
business to create jobs and deprive the IRA of recruits.
   O'Connor said the hopelessness he encountered at Divis Flats,
where the unemployment rate is 86 percent, ``grinds into my soul.''
   ``I think it would be a tremendous contribution, if far more
American industry were to invest over here,'' he said.
   The cardinal acknowledged that violence makes it hard to attract
industry to Northern Ireland. ``Industry is not going to risk
(coming here) if it feels it is going to be subjected to terrorist
activity. So the wheel keeps turning,'' he said.
   During his visit to Divis Flats, he was surrounded by children,
several of whom he asked to ``Give me five.''
   While slapping hands with the prelate, Mary Brannin, 10, asked
him ``What is a cardinal?.''
   O'Connor retorted with a laugh, ``It's a red bird.''
   ``That was great for me,'' O'Connor later told reporters. ``That
reminds you it's all a lot of puffery. It brings you down to
earth.''

<HEAD>Chrysler Tells Dealers Of Fleet Price Increase; Retail Prices
Unknown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has told its auto dealers that
prices for fleets of 1989-model cars will increase between 3
percent and 5 percent, a company spokesman said today.
   However, those tentative increases may not have a bearing on
final retail prices, which are expected to be announced in August
along with final fleet prices, said spokesman Tony Cervone.
   Auto dealers frequently sign contracts to deliver new cars
before the model year starts for large fleet customers, such as
rental car companies.
   ``You give your fleet prices (early) so dealers can lock in
prices early,'' he said.
   Final prices may fluctuate depending on a number of things,
including competitors' prices and, to a smaller extent, sales
figures and inventories, Cervone said.
   Last year, Chrysler announced 8 percent to 12 percent retail
price increases but wound up with final increases less than that.
The prices for some of the company's slowest selling 1988-model
cars fell, compared with 1987 models.
   At Ford Motor Co. today, spokesman Dave Krupp said there was no
firm schedule for notifying dealers of tentative fleet prices for
the coming model year.
   General Motors Corp. spokesman Dave Hudgens said today he had no
immediate comment on fleet or retail prices.

   A charity founded to grant dying children
their last wishes has agreed to pay the state $50,000 and go out of
business to settle accusations that it misused funds, the state
attorney general announced today.
   The husband and wife who founded the Genie Project were accused
of receiving excessive salaries, giving themselves loans, leasing a
Cadillac, paying the rent on their home and even renting an X-rated
movie with the charity's money.
   Under the agreement, Michael and Suzanne Bates admitted no
wrongdoing and agreed never to hold any office or directorship in a
Connecticut charity, according to state Attorney General Joseph I.
Lieberman.
   The agreement was entered in the form of a judgment in Waterbury
Superior Court on July 7 and final notice was received last week at
the attorney general's office, Lieberman said. A lawsuit filed on
Sept. 12, 1985 accused the couple of violating state charity laws.
   Michael Bates has paid $18,259 to the state Consumer Protection
Department. Another $5,298 has been seized from various banks,
Lieberman's office said.
   Suzanne Bates will pay $24,259 to the state over 122 months, and
$5,000 worth of computer equipment will be turned over to the
Consumer Protection Department, Lieberman's office said.
   The Bates also were put on probation for two years in a criminal
case brought by the attorney general. They had been charged with
providing false information to the Consumer Protection Department.
   The two couldn't immediately be reached for comment. There is no
telephone listing for either Bates. Their attorney, Hugh Keefe of
New Haven, wasn't in his office this morning, his secretary said.

<HEAD>Chicago's Smoking Ban Goes Into Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a new anti-smoking law, smokers were
lighting up today in taxicabs, airport terminals, bus stations and
other forbidden places.
   ``There hasn't been any difference today,'' said Loice Wright, a
ticket agent with the Chicago Transit Authority. ``People aren't
paying any attention to the ban.''
   Smoking also is banned in subway stations.
   The law, which took effect Sunday, forbids smoking in enclosed
public places and requires employers to designate no-smoking areas
if requested by workers.
   ``We're complying with the ordinance,'' Kathy Gucfa, spokeswoman
at Sears Roebuck and Co. corporate headquarters in downtown
Chicago, said today. She said she knew of no complaints about the
new law from the 8,000 headquarters employees.
   Similar laws have taken effect in New York, Los Angeles and
other cities around the country.
   However, if non-smokers here were annoyed by smokers' behavior,
the police hadn't heard about it.
   ``We've had no complaints at all,'' officer Emmett O'Connell
said Sunday night at police headquarters.
   Police Supt. LeRoy Martin has pointed out that the ordinance
creating the ban, while it established fines of $25 to $100, did
not give officers the power of arrest. He's suggested that
non-smokers give dirty looks to people smoking where they shouldn't.
   But some non-smokers don't seem to care.
   ``I don't think it should be that big an issue,'' said
non-smoker Jim O'Brien. ``Smoking has been a way of life in this
country for years. To take that away now is unfair.''
   Frank Niemien, who quit smoking two years ago, said he doesn't
like the ban either.
   ``What else are they going to take away?'' he said. ``They'll be
coming into our bedrooms pretty soon and telling us what to do
there.''
   Although smoking in taxicabs also is outlawed, taxi driver Dean
Davis, a three-pack-a-day smoker, said: ``I'll smoke in my own cab
no matter what the law says. I will never tell a passenger not to
smoke.''
   Taxi driver Suheil Ajaj, who said he doesn't smoke himself, said
he believes taxi riders have a right to light up. ``I believe the
customer is paying for the right to smoke,'' he said.

   Rescue workers have recovered 72 bodies from a
passenger boat that sank last week in the fast-flowing waters of a
Yangtze River tributary, the official Xinhua News Agency said today.
   Xinhua said rescue work continued for about 30 other people
still missing and presumed to have gone down with the vessel when
it struck a rock Thursday in the Min River in southwest China's
Sichuan province.
   The news agency said 152 people had been rescued. There have
been differing estimates of the number of dead and missing because
of the remoteness of the area and confusion about how many people
were on the boat.
   Xinhua said rescue efforts were being hampered by rapid currents
in the river, which was swollen from torrential rains.
   The Chuanyun No. 24 had been traveling in a remote mountain area
between the towns of Yibin and Leshan, stopping along the river to
pick up and unload passengers. The boat was owned by the Chongqing
Shipping Co.
   The China News Service, another official news agency, said today
the sunken boat, which had been carried downstream by the
undercurrent, had been located by Sunday and divers had reached the
location.
   The news service said most of the missing were from towns and
villages near where the boat sank. There were apparently no
foreigners aboard.

<HEAD>Yellowstone Blaze Grows; 22,000-Acre Blaze Slows</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to update sizes of fires, add Clover Mist
fire, nearness to Old Faithful, hosing down buildings.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By THEASA TUOHY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A forest fire in Yellowstone National Park that doubled in size
to more than 2,500 acres was within nine miles of Old Faithful
geyser today, while a 23,100-acre blaze in the nearby Teton
Wilderness appeared to be slowing down.
   Roughly 40,000 acres of Yellowstone have been burned by several
fires, including 31,500 acres charred by the Clover Mist fire in
the eastern half of the 2.2 million-acre park, said park
spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   ``These are conditions that we haven't seen in the recorded
history of Yellowstone,'' she said.
   The park's south entrance, a hotel and two campgrounds were
closed because of other fires and crews were hosing down some roofs
to protect them from sparks.
   Hot, dry weather also helped fan flames over thousands of acres
of trees and brush in Washington state, Montana, Colorado, Idaho,
Wyoming and Utah.
   Two fires that burned together over some 10,800 acres in
California's Gold Rush country were contained Saturday and 90
percent controlled Sunday night, officials said. Damage in the twin
fires was estimated at $11 million. A fire is considered contained
when a fire break is built around it, and controlled when it is
reduced to smoldering patches.
   Fire strategists met in Yellowstone at Old Faithful today to map
out battle plans against fires in and around the nation's oldest
park.
   ``They have so many fires going on right now in Yellowstone,
they have to make some decisions on where to put their resources,''
said Lisa Lew, spokeswoman for the adjacent Targhee National Forest
in Idaho.
   In Wyoming, the southern end of the 23,100-acre Mink Creek fire
in the Bridger-Teton National Forest's Teton Wilderness was about
90 percent contained, but officials worried today that a wind shift
could push the flames into dense stands of timber, said fire
information officer Ed Waldapfel.
   The northern end of that fire, which was started by lightning in
late June, had crossed Yellowstone's boundary into a backcountry
region and firefighters were trying to keep it from advancing.
   The south entrance to Yellowstone, along with the Grant Village
hotel and two campgrounds, were closed because of other fires. Two
fires along the shores of Lewis and Shoshone lakes were less than
one mile from Grant Village today, prompting crews to remove downed
trees from around the campgrounds and hotel and to hose down the
buildings to keep drifting embers from setting them ablaze, said
Anzelmo.
   Along the west side of Yellowstone, the 2,500-acre North Fork
fed on insect-killed trees in prime grizzly bear habitat on an
isolated plateau and was within nine miles of Old Faithful, leading
officials to consider additional closures.
   ``It's burning in that bug-kill lodgepole (pine trees) that's
just dead wood and real dry,'' said John Quackenbush, a helicopter
pilot working on the fire. ``It's really cookin'.''
   The fire, believed to be man-caused, started Friday just across
the Idaho border in the Targhee National Forest. Wind blew it
quickly into Yellowstone.
   Rod Richardson, ranger for the Targhee forest's Island Park
District, said all but about 20 acres of the fire were inside
Yellowstone. The Idaho portion of the blaze was contained by late
Sunday.
   In the eastern part of the park, crews were working along the
eastern edge of the Clover Mist fire to keep it out of adjacent
Shoshone National Forest, said Anzelmo.
   Extra crews and more equipment have been called in to battle a
500-acre fire raging out of control near Flaming Gorge Dam on the
Utah-Colorado border, and Mike Stubbs, of the U.S. Forest Service
at Ashley National Forest, said 3,000-4,000 more acres was expected
to burn today in the remote, tinder-dry forest.
   Officials said they expected to contain a stubborn, 2,100-acre
high-desert fire in south-central Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest
today.
   More than 400 firefighters, supported by helicopters and aerial
tankers filled with fire retardant, battled the 4-day-old blaze.
   In Montana, 160 firefighters worked to contain a 250-acre blaze
in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. The fire threatened to spread
into an area filled with dead and dying trees, said Deanna Riede, a
Forest Service spokeswoman in Missoula.
   Despite temperatures that reached 94 degrees on the fire lines,
about 210 firefighters Sunday afternoon brought a 2,420-acre blaze
on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington under control, said
Norm Anderson, a Wenatchee National Forest official.

   An explosion at a chemical plant early
today rocked this Chicago suburb, injuring four employees and
forcing at least 300 people from their homes for almost two hours,
officials said.
   Police evacuated the residents living near Unocal Corp.'s
chemical division polymer manufacturing plant as a precaution when
irritating fumes drifted through the area following the 1 a.m.
explosion, said dispatcher Mark McFall.
   About 300 people, many in pajamas and carrying children, crowded
into the John A. Oremus Community Center, said Sophie Robish, who
helps out at the center.
   ``We heard the explosion and jumped out of bed like a spring,''
said Mrs. Robish, 50, who lives two blocks from the plant.
   The residents were allowed back in their homes nearly two hours
later, after the fumes cleared the area, McFall said.
   Investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
the Illinois EPA were at the scene, about 13 miles southwest of
Chicago, trying to determine the origin and cause of the blaze,
said Deputy Chief Chuck Corkery of the Cook County Emergency
Services and Disaster Agency.
   The plant, formerly known as the Union Chemical plant, makes
latex, an adhesive used to bind materials in paint. The blast
apparently occurred in ``an explosion-proof area'' equipped with
special electrical wiring and reinforced walls, said John Maher,
manager of field services at Unocal's chemical division in suburban
Schaumburg.
   Maher said damage to the plant was ``extensive.''
   Nursing supervisor Sharon Hann of Christ Hospital and Medical
Center said three victims were brought to the emergency room, one
of whom was badly burned and transferred to Loyola University
Medical Center. A fourth victim, also badly burned, was taken
directly to Loyola.
   Mrs. Robish said volunteers at the community center served
coffee to the evacuees.
   ``A lot of people are in their night gowns, with their pillows
and puppies and children,'' she said.
   Among the evacuees was Katie Dyrda, 22.
   ``I just got done reading and was getting ready for bed when I
heard this very loud boom,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dyrda said she grabbed her 3-year-old son and headed for
the center.

   Former college football star Bobby
Hoppe will not be retried in a 31-year-old slaying because there is
no new evidence in the case, a prosecutor said today.
   ``We have gone to great extremes to try to find new proof in
this case ... There is no new proof. There is nothing different
than what we had initially,'' said District Attorney General Gary
Gerbitz.
   Hoppe, 53, went on trial last month for the July 20, 1957,
shotgun death of moonshine runner Don Hudson, but a mistrial was
declared when the jury deadlocked 10-2 for acquittal.
   The state contended that Hoppe, then a 22-year-old college
student, killed Hudson because Hudson, 24, had beaten Joan Hoppe
Voiles, Hudson's ex-girlfriend and Hoppe's sister.
   Hoppe claimed self-defense, testifying that he fired a shotgun
at Hudson only after the bootlegger drove up beside his car on a
dark street and pointed a pistol at him.
   The prosecutor said the state was handicapped because it could
try Hoppe only for first-degree murder, since the statute of
limitations for lesser degrees of homicide has expired.
   ``If this case would have gone to the jury under a first-degree,
second-degree, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter
option, the outcome may very well have been different in June,'' he
said.
   Nevertheless, Gerbitz said, the state was pleased that it had
finally answered the question of who had killed Hudson.
   ``For 31 years, the Hudson family lived with the fact that they
didn't know who killed their son and their brother,'' he said.
``They know now who killed him. And even though his admission is
one of self-defense, it was an admission.''
   At the time of the slaying, Hoppe was preparing for his senior
year at Auburn, where he was a halfback on the football team. That
fall, the Tigers went 10-0 and won their only national championship.
   Although Hoppe was questioned about the slaying in 1957, no
charges were filed until March 2, 1988, when he was indicted after
a 14-month investigation that began when Hudson's mother, Georgia
Hudson, asked police to reopen the case.

<HEAD>Pinochet Expected To Be Single Presidential Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chile's four top military commanders will
meet Aug. 30 to pick the candidate for the presidential referendum
later this year, the government announced today.
   President Augusto Pinochet, 72, the right-wing military
commander who has ruled Chile since coming to power in a 1973 coup,
is widely expected to be the lone candidate.
   It will be the first presidential voting in Chile since 1970,
when Salvador Allende, a Marxist, was elected. He died in the coup
led by Pinochet.
   The presidential nomination is to be made by Pinochet, the army
commander, and by Air Force chief Gen. Fernando Matthei, Navy
commander Adm. Jose Toribio Merino, and national police chief
Rodolfo Stange.
   The nomination, based on a 1980 military-drafted Constitution,
must be unanimous and made within 48 hours. If the four commanders
disagree, the candidate is to be chosen by the National Security
Council, made up of Pinochet, the four-member military junta and
the presidents of the Supreme Court and the Council of State. The
latter is a Pinochet-appointed official.
   The Constitution mandates that the vote be held within 30 to 60
days after the nomination of the candidate.
   Matthei said last week that the date for the vote has been set,
but he would not disclose it. The vote is widely expected to be
held in the first week of October, according to unofficial reports.
   In the voting, Chileans will only be able to vot ``yes'' or
``no'' on the candidate.
   If he wins approval, the candidate will serve an eight-year term
starting March 11, 1989. If he is rejected by voters, a
multi-candidate election will be held in 1990, with Pinochet
remaining in power until then.

<HEAD>Drought Has Trout Farmers Rushing From Hatcheries To Streams</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARION, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weeks of dry, hot weather are forcing the
state's four trout farms into a race with drought as workers rush
to transfer fish from too-warm hatching troughs to cooler streams
before they die.
   ``The warmer the water the less oxygen the water has, and we
have trouble keeping them alive,'' said Tom Ort, a worker at the
state's Armstrong Fish Hatchery in Marion.
   ``We'd rather give the fishermen their fish a month early rather
than keep them.''
   Because of the summer drought, the state Wildlife Resources
Commission must finish stocking 600,000 fish in streams, lakes and
rivers by the end of July, a month earlier than usual, officials
say.
   Already, the water in Armstrong Creek, which feeds into
fish-hatching troughs at the Armstrong hatchery, has topped 70
degrees three times this month, Ort said. Water levels in the creek
have dropped as well, forcing Ort to allow seven of his 20 ponds to
dry up.
   Most of western North Carolina's 2,000 miles of trout streams,
lakes and rivers must be stocked by the commission to maintain the
popular sport of trout-fishing.
   The state's trout-stocking program breeds the fish and raises
them from eggs to a catchable size _ 8 inches or longer when the
fish are about 18 months old, officials say.
   Once in the state's rivers and streams, most trout are caught
within a week or two, said Mallory Martin, a production coordinator
for the Wildlife Commission in Marion.
   ``I would expect the catch to be higher than usual because the
water levels have been so low the fish don't have a place to escape
to,'' Ms. Martin said.

<HEAD>Sikh Extremists Kill Golden Temple Head Priest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARBAKSH SINGH NANDA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   -
   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ Sikh extremists today shot and killed
the head priest of the Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine in
the city of Amritsar, police said.
   The militants also killed a secretary of the temple committee,
according to police.
   The victims were identified as head priest Sohan Singh and Bhan
Singh, secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee,
which manages Sikh temples.
   The head of the committee, Mal Singh Ghuman, suffered at least
four bullet wounds and was reported in critical condition in a
hospital, police said.
   According to police, Sikh extremists opened fire on the three
men at noon on a street in Ludhiana, about 55 miles west of the
state capital of Chandigarh.
   The assailants sprayed them with bullets from a AK-47 Chinese
rifle as the three emerged from a board meeting of an engineering
college, Indian news agencies said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
   The temple committee appointed Sohan Singh head priest in May,
after police and paramilitary troops forced more than 150 Sikh
extremists out of the Golden Temple, which they used as a base to
wage their guerrilla war for an independent homeland in the
northwestern state of Punjab.
   The head priest's predecessor and four other Sikh high priests,
who were jailed during the operation, remain in police custody.
   The appointment of Sohan Singh, a moderate, was opposed by the
militants, who also objected to the priest's efforts to exonerate
former Punjab Chief Minister Surjit Singh Barnala. Barnala had been
excommunicated from the Sikh faith by radical priests in charge of
the temple.
   Police today reported four other deaths in extremist violence in
Punjab.
   The latest victims raised to at least 1,560 the number of people
killed by Sikh militants in Punjab this year. An estimated 690 of
those killed have been Sikhs.
   The Sikh religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's population, but
they are a majority in Punjab. Militant Sikhs contend members of
the faith are discriminated against by India's majority Hindus.

<TEXT>
   Arab assailants today stoned an Israeli army
jeep in the occupied Gaza Strip, forcing the jeep to veer off the
road and turn over, the army said. Four military police were
injured.
   The incident occurred several hours after the army freed 148
Palestinian prisoners from Gaza as a goodwill gesture to Moslems on
the four-day Eid al-Adha holiday, or ``Feast of the Sacrifice.''
   An army spokesman said the jeep carrying green-uniformed border
patrol guards was stoned as it patrolled the Jabaliya refugee camp.
   The driver was injured in the hand and veered off the road, said
the spokesman, who could not be identified in accordance with army
regulations. Three other police suffered minor injuries and two of
them were taken to a hospital, he said.
   Arab news reports said soldiers immediately clamped a curfew on
the camp, banning more than 60,000 residents from leaving their
homes.
   The army today freed 148 Palestinians from the Ketziot tent
prison in the Negev desert, a spokesman said.
   He said some had been jailed without trial and the rest were
serving short sentences for crimes linked to the Palestinian
uprising.
   Israel radio said more than 3,000 Palestinian detainees would
remain in Ketziot. The army said it held more than 5,000
Palestinian prisoners in Ketziot and other prisons.
   The prisoners' release came a day after confrontations in the
occupied territories left two Palestinians dead and six wounded,
raising to 233 the Arab death toll since the uprising began Dec. 8.
Four Israelis have also died.
   Seven cities and refugee camps in the West Bank remained under
curfew today after the clashes, the army said.
   The unrest was partly triggered by coinciding Jewish and Moslem
holidays. The Moslem feast marks when the biblical patriarch
Abraham was ordered by God to sacrifice his son, Isaac.
   The Jewish commemoration marks the destruction of a Jerusalem
temple by Roman rulers nearly 2,000 years ago.
   A holiday custom calls for the Moslems to visit cemeteries and
leaders of the uprising called on their followers to visit the
graves of Arabs slain during the uprising.
   In an unprecedented ruling Sunday, Israel's Supreme Court upheld
an army decision to temporarily occupy a Palestinian home so
soldiers could oversee a highway that has been the scene of
numerous stoning attacks on Israeli vehicles.
   Court spokesman Shmaryahu Cohen said the ruling appeared to be
the first time the court had allowed soldiers to take over an Arab
house for security purposes.
   In the past, the army has confiscated, wrecked or sealed homes
belonging to Palestinians suspected of involvement in anti-Israeli
violence. Army radio said soldiers have wrecked or sealed up 52
Palestinian homes since December.
   The ruling was one of a series of decisions since the uprising
began in which the court has consistently upheld measures of the
Israeli military authorities.

suburban Mount Pleasant had been slated for part of a residential
development, but a citizens group known as Friends of Historic Snee
Farm took title to the property over the weekend.
   The group bought the property for $2 million, but must still
raise $1 million to pay off a bank loan, said Charleston attorney
Nancy Hawk, one of the organizers of the preservation effort.
   The group plans to pay off the remaining debt and turn the site
over to the National Park Service.
   About 50 people, including state and federal officials, gathered
under rainy skies outside the 18th century structure Saturday for
the announcement.
   ``This is a wonderful time for the state of South Carolina
because you're preserving a piece of our state that cannot be
duplicated and cannot be replicated,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said.
   The farm house dates to 1754. Pinckey not only was a signer of
the Constitution, but also served as a state lawmaker, governor,
U.S. senator, congressman and American minister to Spain.
   Pinckney claimed to be 26 at the time of the Constitutional
Convention in 1787, which would have made him the youngest signer.
However, he was really 29 at the time, and Jonathan Dayton of New
Jersey, at 27, was actually the youngest signer.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond told the group ``you're preserving here some
of the most important history of South Carolina.'' He called
Pinckney the ``second most important man'' at the constitutional
convention after James Madison.
   The Darby family, which owned the property, also gave a gift of
$100,000 for the effort.
   ``Of course it's a beautiful piece of property and as you know I
would have liked to have developed it. But since they made such a
dedicated effort, we think we did the right thing,'' said Gordon
Darby, one of the owners.
   U.S. Sen. Ernest Hollings said the park service has agreed to
restore the vacant house and operate it as an educational resource.
   Jerry Rogers, the assistant director of cultural affairs for the
National Parks Service, said it will cost about $500,000 a year to
operate the Pinckney home.

<HEAD>Innocent Plea in Recruit's Swimming Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Navy swimming instructor today pleaded
innocent to all charges against him in the death of a recruit
during a training exercise.
   Petty Officer Michael Combe is charged with involuntary
manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery in the death
of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., described as
being literally scared to death.
   An Aug. 29 trial date was set for his court-martial.
   The Navy has accused Combe of holding Mirecki's head under water
after other instructors had physically forced the recruit back into
a swimming pool at Pensacola Naval Air Station. Mirecki was pushed
back in after he panicked, climbed out and shouted that he was
quitting the course.
   Also facing court-martial is Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, officer in
charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School at the time of Mirecki's
death. Torchia, who was on the telephone in his office overlooking
the pool, is charged with dereliction of duty and scheduled for
trial Aug. 22.
   Four petty officers, all instructors, were charged with
conspiracy to commit battery and have been given non-judicial
punishments including reductions in rank and loss of pay.
   Combe's plea was accepted and the trial date set by Cmdr.
Gregory R. Radlinski, a military judge.
   Defense lawyers had asked to delay the trial until late
September due to the illness of the wife of Combe's military
counsel, Marine Capt. James Royce. The judge said he may reconsider
the request for a delay if Mrs. Royce's condition doesn't improve
within a week.
   Two civilian lawyers, Bill Wiltshire and Robert Heath Jr.,
joined Combe's defense team last week.
   After Mirecki was pushed back into the pool, Combe allegedly
grasped him in a head-hold and dragged him into deep water.
   The head-hold was part of a training exercise known as ``sharks
and daisies'' in which instructors, playing the role of panicked
air crash victims, would grab trainees who were supposed to pull
them under water to break loose and then make a rescue.
   At the investigative hearing, a pathologist testified Mirecki
had a phobia about being dragged under water, which triggered heart
failure followed by drowning.

   A blaze that raged for eight days
and destroyed more than 10,000 acres of forests near the
Yugoslav-Greek border has been brought under control, media reports
said Monday.
   The fire occurred in the Valandovo region of Macedonia several
miles north of the frontier with Greece.
   The blaze was started by a farmworker who did not extinguish a
cigarette, a newspaper reported. It eventually was subdued by
thousands of firefighters, soldiers and local inhabitants, with
help from three air force water bombers.
   The intense temperatures from the fire set off explosions in a
World War II minefield, but no one was hurt, reports said.
   Southern Yugoslavia and neighboring Greece have been hit by a
protracted heat wave that has sparked other forest fires.

   President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali on
Monday signed into law a new constitution that eliminates the post
of president-for-life and establishes age limits for the chief of
state.
   Ben Ali also announced partial legislative elections would be
held after November with general elections to follow before 1991.
The partial elections are to fill vacancies in the Chamber of
Deputies created when Ben Ali appointed a Cabinet.
   The president, who took power in a bloodless coup in November,
made no reference to presidential elections. There has been
speculation that he might announce a date for voters to select a
new head of state.
   Ben Ali ousted President-for-Life Habib Bouguiba on Nov. 7,
saying the 84-year-old leader was too senile to lead.
   The new constitution, passed by parliament earlier this year,
eliminates the post of president-for-life and says presidential
candidates must be at least 40 years of age and no older than 70.

   It was the first time the United States has sent military

   A white university student who
refused to do cumpulsory military service on the grounds he would
be ``defending racism'' was sentenced Monday to six years in prison.
   Magistrate P.H. Bredenkamp imposed the maximum penalty on David
Bruce for his refusal to undergo the military training required of
all white males in South Africa.
   ``The consequences of your imprisonment are in you own hands,''
Bredenkamp told Bruce, 25. ``You have had the opportunity ... to
provide a useful service to the public.''
   The training involves two years of initial service. Afterward,
men are subject to annual military call-ups that can last as long
as three months.
   ``My view of the South African Defense Force is that it is not a
peace-keeping force but that its basic function is that of
upholding and defending racism,'' Bruce said last week at his trial.
   Bruce declined to request a non-combat posting, which sometimes
is granted to men who object to military training on religious
grounds. Bruce refused to serve for moral and political reasons,
saying he strongly opposed the government's apartheid policies of
racial segregation.
   The government does not release statistics on how many white men
refuse to serve in the military.

<HEAD>China Boosts Cigarette, Liquor Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday announced sharp price
increases for cigarettes and liquor, but also said
inflation-battered consumers will be spared further increases this
year.
   Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State Council, or cabinet, said the
prices of famous brand cigarettes and spirits will be allowed to
float as of Tuesday, putting an end to government-fixed, and
generally arbitrarily low, prices.
   Yuan said the State Council had decided not to carry out any
other price reforms this year to curb inflation, which has been
rising at an alarming rate since the beginning of 1988, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The State Statistics Bureau said last week that consumer prices
in June were 19 percent higher than in the same month in 1987,
compared to an inflation rate of 7.2 percent for all of last year.
   The government earlier this year raised the prices of eggs,
vegetables, pork and sugar as part of reforms aimed at ending state
controls over prices and allowing the value of goods to be
determined by market forces.
   The elimination of government controls has caused the prices of
some goods to soar as the inefficient economy fails to keep up with
rising demand. Black market dealings and hoarding of goods still
sold at government-set prices have also boosted prices.
   Xinhua quoted Li Changbi, an official of the State
Administration of Commodity Prices, as saying the prices of famous
brand cigarettes could go up between 15 and 290 percent after they
are allowed to fluctuate.
   Li said the price for a bottle of ``Maotai,'' China's most
famous and sought-after spirit, will jump from $5.40 to $32.40.
   Yuan said the price increases for choice cigarettes and wines
will have little social impact ``because most buyers are government
organizations and those individuals with high incomes.''
   But Li said the price of B-grade cigarettes will also be boosted
by 13.4 percent and all alcohol made from grain will go up in price
by 20 percent.
   China uses 14 million tons of grain a year to make beer and
other alcohol, and the government has said this is a luxury the
nation can't afford when it is struggling to produce enough grain
just to keep its 1 billion people fed.
   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and other
reform-minded leaders in recent months have emphasized that price
reform is risky but inevitable if China is to modernize its economy
and end the heavy financial burden of price subsidizing.
   The government has put off decontrolling prices, partly because
of mounting public discontent over the rising cost of living.
   The Politburo, the party's supreme decision-making body,
announced in June that systematic plans for price reform were being
drawn up. Senior officials said the program would take three to
five years to carry out.
   Yuan said price adjustments will resume Jan. 1, 1989, when
newspapers, which have been hit by jumps in the price of newsprint,
will cost more. He did not say what the increase would be.
   Yuan said the rise in the cost of cigarettes should curb
speculation and profiteering that has thrived under the current
pricing system.
   China is the world's biggest cigarette producer and consumer,
turning out 228 billion cigarettes a year for its 300 million
smokers.

<TEXT>
   A special ruling party congress today
accepted the resignation of strongman Ne Win but rejected his call
for a referendum that could have ended 26 years of one-party rule,
a congress delegate said.
   Official Rangoon Radio, however, said only that Ne Win's
resignation had been debated by the delegates and did not indicate
what action, if any, was reached.
   The delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
ruling Burma Socialist Program Party congress agreed to accept the
resignations of Ne Win as party chief and San Yu as the vice
chairman, but to retain them as ``inactive members.''
   Burmese analysts suggested that the vagueness of the official
radio broadcast reflected divisions within party ranks.
   The broadcast said the 1,061 party delegates empowered the
party's central committee to evaluate a sweeping proposal for
economic reform. But it gave no indication of whether any of the
new measures had been accepted.
   The three-day congress of the ruling Burma Socialist Program
Party has been considering dramatic changes in a state-controlled
economic system that turned a potentially prosperous country into a
debt-ridden, poverty-stricken nation.
   The key architect of the system, Ne Win, tendered his
resignation Saturday as chairman of the party and offered to remove
himself from political life. Five other top leaders likewise
submitted resignations.
   State Radio announced Sunday that an emergency session of
Parliament would convene Wednesday, apparently to act on Ne Win's
proposal of holding a referendum on whether Burma should scrap a
quarter century of one-party rule in favor of a multi-party system.
   The emergency session could also deal with the appointment of
new government leaders to replace the five who are resigning. The
five, including President San Yu, held government posts in addition
to their party positions.
   Prime Minister Maung Maung Kha, one of the few top leaders not
on the resignation roll, was expected to be named today to replace
the 77-year-old Ne Win as chairman of the ruling party.
   The sudden and generally unexpected changes come in wake of
bloody anti-government riots and worsening economic conditions in
the isolationist Southeast Asian nation.
   The official radio, broadcasting from the congress, carried
speeches of several among the more than 1,000 delegates asking Ne
Win to reconsider his retirement ``until success has been
achieved.''
   Indeed, some Western diplomats doubt that Ne Win _ who has held
undisputed power for 26 years _ will desist from interference in
the future party and the organization of the new government.
   Not only did the former military chief, who seized power in a
1962 coup, crush anti-government opposition that occasionally
flared. He also moved against leaders within his own ranks when
they exhibited too much promise and independence.
   This has left a leadership vacuum in Rangoon that may prove
difficult to fill if there is a wholesale removal of officials from
party and government ranks, as Ne Win indicated.
   Maung Maung Kha, who assumed the prime ministership in 1977, has
to date not exhibited any particular dynamism or vision that would
be necessary to implement the wide-ranging reforms being debated by
the congress.
   In a speech on Sunday, party general secretary Aye Ko admitted
that economic production had declined, working skills have
deteriorated and ``losses and wastages cannot be controlled
effectively.''
   ``Because of these weaknesses and as a result of adverse
repercussions from the world economic conditions today, the state
economic situation is declining,'' he said.
   Aye Ko called for cutting most state involvement in agriculture,
mining, fisheries, industry, transportation and other economic
sectors.
   He also called for allowing private joint ventures between
Burmese entrepreneurs and foreign investors, something Ne Win
outlawed shortly after seizing power.
   Since October, student-led demonstrations have erupted three
times in Rangoon and the unrest spread to other cities.
   Martial law continues in Prome, 180 miles north of the capital,
where there were riots last week.
   Last month, at least 50 people died in anti-government unrest.

   The crash occurred at about 10:15 a.m. and the pilot was picked
up about 40 minutes later by a helicopter from the Marine Corps Air
Station in Beaufort, said Dave McMahon, a spokesman at Shaw Air
Force Base in Sumter.
   The accident happened about 50 miles off the coast, he said.
   The pilot, whose identity wasn't immediately released, was taken
to a hospital for examination, McMahon said. His condition wasn't
immediately known.
   McMahon said that a board of officers from Shaw will investigate
the cause.
   The crash was reported by another plane that was on the training
exercise with the one-seat F-16, McMahon said.

   Americans believe the United States has lost its
edge in space exploration and favor initiatives including a U.S.
space station and manned flights to Mars, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   A sizable share of the respondents in the national poll said the
United States was doing too little in space exploration. As well as
backing new efforts, a majority expressed support for the space
shuttle program.
   NASA plans to resume shuttle launches in September, more than 2{
years after the shuttle Challenger exploded during takeoff, killing
the seven astronauts aboard. However, equipment problems may delay
the launch.
   Nearly half of the 1,223 adults surveyed said the shuttle
explosion had shaken their confidence in NASA, and 60 percent of
that group said their faith in the space agency has not been
restored.
   That means that about 30 percent of all respondents lacked
confidence in NASA. Still, when asked to rate its overall
effectiveness, 58 percent said it has done a good or excellent job
while 37 percent said only fair or poor.
   About half the respondents said NASA's budget should remain the
same, and 30 percent said it should be increased. Despite concerns
over the federal deficit, only 18 percent said the space budget
should be decreased. And of those who wanted NASA's budget
increased, 74 percent said they would be willing to pay higher
taxes to accomplish it.
   In another indication of general support for space projects, 40
percent said the nation was doing too little in exploring space and
36 percent said it was doing about enough. Just about a fifth said
the United States was doing too much in space exploration.
   There was a striking split between the sexes, with men far more
likely than women to favor space programs. Fifty-six percent of men
said the United States was doing too little in space exploration;
only a quarter of women agreed. Forty-one percent of men supported
increasing the space exploration budget, compared to just 19
percent of women.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was created by
Congress 30 years ago to pursue civilian exploration of space, but
in recent years it increasingly has handled military payloads as
well. That was opposed by a slim plurality in the survey:
Forty-eight percent said NASA should be involved in non-military
projects only, while 41 percent approved including military work.
The split was narrowly outside the poll's margin of error of plus
or minus three percentage points.
   Fewer than a quarter of respondents said the United States is
ahead of the Soviet Union in space exploration, while the remainder
were split on whether the Soviets are ahead or the two countries
are about even.
   At the same time, there was sentiment for superpower cooperation
in space. About half of those polled favored last month's proposal
by the Soviets for a U.S.-Soviet joint effort to send astronauts to
Mars.
   An additional 15 percent said the United States should work
alone to reach Mars. Taken together, 64 percent favored some
program to land astronauts on Mars, while 30 percent were opposed.
The rest had no opinion.
   NASA has no program to send astronauts to Mars. It is seeking
funding for a space station, but the $200 million approved by the
Senate this month is only enough to phase out the program or put it
on hold. The House had approved $700 million and a joint committee
is to resolve the issue.
   The goal of a space station was supported by 55 percent, with 34
percent opposed.
   On the soon-to-be resumed space shuttle program, 40 percent said
efforts should be expanded and the same number said work should
continue at the same level. Fewer than a fifth said the shuttle
program should be cut back.
   The Media General-AP poll consisted of telephone interviews June
22-July 2 with a randomly selected sample of 1,223 adults across
the nation. Media General Inc., a communications company based in
Richmond, Va., publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond
News Leader, the Tampa (Fla). Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.)

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with 1,223 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
in each household who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results,
19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five
points, for example, for those who want the budget for space
exploration to be increased.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed
100:
   1. In general, do you think the United States is doing too much
in space exploration right now, or too little, or about enough?
   Too much: 19 percent. Too little: 40 percent. About enough: 36
percent. Don't know or no answer: 5 percent.
   2. Do you think the space shuttle program should be expanded,
cut back, or kept at the same level?
   Expanded: 40 percent. Cut back: 17 percent. Same level: 40
percent. DK-NA: 3 percent.
   3. Do you think the United States should build a space station,
or not?
   Yes: 55 percent. No: 34 percent. DK-NA: 12 percent.
   4. The Soviet Union has suggested a joint program with the
United States to land astronauts on Mars. Do you think the United
States should try to land astronauts on Mars by itself, or should
it undertake a joint program with the Soviets, or should the United
States not try to land astronauts on Mars at all?
   By itself: 15 percent. Joint program: 49 percent. Not at all: 30
percent. DK-NA: 7 percent.
   5. Do you think the U.S. government's budget for the overall
space program should be increased, decreased, or kept at the same
level?
   Increased: 30 percent. Decreased: 18 percent. Same level: 48
percent. DK-NA: 5 percent.
   a. If increased: Would you be willing to pay higher taxes for
the increase?
   Yes: 74 percent. No: 20 percent. DK-NA: 6 percent.
   6. Who do you think is ahead in the exploration of space _ the
United States or the Soviet Union, or do you think they are about
equal?
   U.S.: 23 percent. Soviets: 31 percent. Even: 37 percent. DK-NA:
20 percent.
   7. How would you rate the overall effectiveness of the National
Aeronautic and Space Administration, known as NASA _ excellent,
good, only fair or poor?
   Excellent: 10 percent. Good: 45 percent. Only fair: 30 percent.
Poor: 7 percent. DK-NA: 8 percent.
   8. Do you think NASA should be involved in military and
non-military projects in space, or should it be involved only in
non-military projects?
   Both: 41 percent. Only non-military: 48 percent. DK-NA: 11
percent.
   9. The space shuttle program was set back when the shuttle
Challenger exploded in 1986, killing the seven astronauts aboard.
Looking back, did that accident shake your confidence in NASA, or
not?
   Yes: 47 percent. No: 50 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent.
   11. If yes: How about now _ has your confidence in NASA been
restored, or not?
   Yes: 34 percent. No: 60 percent. DK-NA: 6 percent.

   Ann Phillips, Princess Anne's
mother-in-law, died Monday of a pancreas ailment at the age of 62,
Buckingham Palace said.
   Mrs. Phillips was the mother of Capt. Mark Phillips, who in 1973
married Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II.
   A palace spokesman said Phillips was at his mother's side when
she died at Southmead Hospital near her home in Wiltshire, southern
England.
   Other survivors include her husband, Maj. Peter Phillips, and
grandchildren, Peter, 10; and Zara, 7, the son and daughter of Anne
and Mark Phillips. The funeral will be private, Buckingham Palace
said.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for U.S. District Judge Alcee
Hastings have asked for a delay in Tuesday's scheduled vote by the
House Judiciary Committee on an impeachment recommendation,
contending the panel is rushing to a decision on a
precedent-setting issue.
   ``We can't see any need for what seems to us an unseemly
haste,'' said Terence Anderson, one of Hastings' attorneys, on
Monday.
   A committee staff member said the request for a delay had been
received, but that no decision had been made and the vote was still
scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday.
   Hastings, the first black appointed to the federal bench in
Florida, was acquitted in 1983 of bribery charges. But the House
Judiciary criminal justice subcommittee has recommended that he be
impeached on 17 counts of official misconduct, including some
relating to the bribery case.
   The full committee was scheduled to act on the recommendation
Tuesday.
   Anderson contrasted the handling of his client's case with that
of U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi. In Nixon's
case, the subcommittee heard direct evidence from three key
witnesses at his trial, which ended in a conviction for lying to a
grand jury.
   The House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights
brought impeachment charges against Nixon, which still are pending
in Congress.
   But in Hastings' case, the panel relied on second-hand testimony
of prosecutor John Doar, even though Hastings was acquitted of the
charges by the trial jury, he said.
   Anderson also said the printed record of the subcommittee's
proceedings had not yet been printed and distributed to members.
   ``We're saying, `It's just plain unseemly for you to be trying
to decide this before you give members an opportunity to study the
record,''' he said.
   If the Judiciary Committee votes to draft misconduct charges,
the full House is expected to vote on impeachment before it
recesses Aug. 11.
   Hastings was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring with Washington
attorney William A. Borders Jr. for $150,000 in bribes.

   The government announced plans Monday to equip the
Canadian navy with a fleet of 12 mine sweepers at a cost of $623
million.
   ``These vessels will play a crucial role in our coastal security
and sovereignty,'' said Defense Minister Perrin Beatty. ``Without
mine sweepers, Canada's ports could be shut down by hostile mining
activity.''
   The vessels will be designed and built in Canada, and equipped
with 40mm Bofors guns and remote-control mine-hunting systems.
   They will be manned by Canada's 3,000-member naval reserve as
part of a buildup outlined in a 1987 government report on defense
policy.
   Naval reservists are patrolling in trawlers and other small
ships because there are no mine sweepers in the fleet.

<HEAD>China Issues Regulations to Protect Women Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Monday issued regulations forbidding job
discrimination against women and guaranteeing them healthy work
environments.
   The State Council, or Cabinet, also said employers cannot reduce
the wages or annul women's contracts during periods of pregnancy,
maternity leave or nursing.
   The regulations, to go into effect Sept. 1, extended maternity
leave from 56 to 90 days, and stipulate that women who have
difficult deliveries will have an option of another 15 days.
   China's constitution guarantees equality between the sexes, but
in reality Chinese women face various kinds of educational and job
discrimination.
   Women university graduates have much more difficulty finding
suitable jobs than men, women's wages are often lower, and factory
managers with newly won powers to dismiss workers have fired women
in larger numbers than men.
   In the countryside, many girls are forced by custom and parents
to quit school even before completing the compulsory nine years so
they can work in the fields or in factories.
   Women frequently also work in small and often unsafe mines,
although past laws, and the State Council regulations, state that
women are not allowed to engage in underground mining or heavy
labor unsuited to the individual's health.
   The regulations urge employers with a large staff of women to
provide appropriate sanitary equipment, rooms for pregnant women to
rest, and nurseries and kindergartens.
   Xinhua said, without providing details, that violators of the
regulations or those who infringe on the rights of women workers
will be punished.

<HEAD>In The '80s, England Still Swings Like the '60s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you thought the '60s were swinging, just look
at the '80s.
   According to a statistical study published Monday, the sexual
permissiveness associated with the 1960s is tame stuff compared
with the 1980s _AIDS and yuppie puritanism notwithstanding.
   The ``Swinging '60s'' were invented largely by British pop
musicians, fashion designers and hairstylists, so it was
appropriate that the study came from a British independent research
office, the Family Policy Studies Center.
   It reported that the divorce rate has jumped from 2.1 per 1,000
marriages in 1961 to 12.9 in 1986; illegitimate births are up from
6 percent to 21 percent; births are down from 17.9 per 1,000 to
13.3; and teen-age brides are down from 28 percent to 14 percent.
   It says that between 1960 and 1964, only one in 100 first-time
brides under age 25 lived with their partners before marrying them.
Twenty years later, the figure is almost one in four, the study
says.
   Figures for bridegrooms do not appear in the government
statistics used in the study, according to its editor, Melanie
Henwood.
   The report says the figures suggest a much more liberal attitude
in the 1980s toward childbirth out of wedlock.
   Not only has illegitimacy more than trebled, but the mothers
apparently feel much less compulsion to marry before giving birth,
while the fathers are more likely to acknowledge paternity.
   The study said 38 percent of birth certificates for illegitimate
children bore the names of both parents in 1961. In 1986, the
figure had risen to 66 percent, it said.
   ``The paradox of the 1960s may be less of a puzzle than it first
appears,'' the report concludes. ``It is, after all, the people who
grew up in, or were living through, the 1960s who are now making
their appearance in many of the cohabitation, illegitimacy,
marriage and divorce statistics. The class of '68 has come of age.''
   ``The swinging '60s do seem a bit of mythical when we look at
the facts and figures, but it really depends on the image of
'60s,'' Ms. Henwood said in an interview.
   At 30, she admits to having no firsthand experience of the
``Swinging '60s,'' but knows they were ``a period of great change _
music, clothing and politics ... We look back and assume it was a
time of free love, communes, that sort of thing. In fact, what made
the image was a few notorious figures living in permissive
relationships, but their values were not shared by most people at
the time.''
   The Times of London asked some leading figures of the '60s what
they thought of the study.
   ``The `Swinging '60s' took their name from the music, not the
morality,'' said actor Terence Stamp, who made his name playing the
title role in the 1962 film version of ``Billy Budd.''
   ``Compare Michael Jackson to Elvis Presley, Prince to Jimi
Hendrix and the Pet Shop Boys to the Beatles. There you have the
essential difference between the '60s and the '80s,'' Stamp was
quoted as saying.
   Jean Shrimpton, the model who made the miniskirt famous, was
quoted as saying: ``I never had a swinging mentality. I wore short
skirts but I was a commodity of the '60s. It was other people who
were making things happen. I just happened to be there.''
   And cartoonist Ralph Steadman was quoted as saying: ``The
permissive society was about lots of things, not just sex. We were
willing to buck authority ... Now life is getting more and more
standardized and barren, and there is a backlash spurred by AIDS, a
reformist influence which does rather tend to concentrate the
mind.''

<HEAD>Negotiations Begin on New Thai Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOLLY YONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The member parties of the governing
coalition, in control of Parliament after general elections, began
talks Monday that are expected to result in Prem Tinsulanonda
continuing as prime minister.
   Such negotiations have taken weeks after past elections, but
Thai Nation leader Chatichai Choonhavan, whose party got the most
votes, said after Sunday's ballot he felt a prime minister could be
agreed upon this week.
   His party and its three partners in the last coalition won 58
percent of the 357 seats in Parliament's lower house. Prem, a
67-year-old former general, has no party affilitation.
   Chatichai, who was a deputy premier in the last government,
already has expressed support for keeping Prem in office. The prime
minister has made no public statements about the matter.
   Political analysts predict difficulties ahead for an
administration led by the former general.
   ``The new government will face the same difficult problems it
endured under Prem's last administration because there is growing
and open resentment of and opposition to Prem,'' said Somboon
Suksamran, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in
Bangkok.
   Friction among coalition partners caused trouble in Prem's last
government.
   Somboon and other political observers say Prem might not be able
to complete a four-year term. He called Sunday's election two years
early.
   Prem has been prime minister since 1980, dissolved Parliament
twice for elections, survived two coup attempts and formed five
cabinets. He is the longest-serving premier in modern Thai history.
   Among his serious problems are flagging support in the powerful
military, sharp criticisms from opposition parties and protests by
students and labor.
   ``These pressures will only get more intense,'' Somboon told The
Associated Press.
   Party leader Chatichai told newsmen Monday a ``gentlemen's
agreement'' had been reached by the four coalition partners to back
Prem. The person chosen also must be approved by King Bhumibol
Adulyadej, Thailand's constitutional monarch.
   Thai Nation, Chatichai's well-financed party, won 87 seats in
the House of Representatives in Thailand's 17th general election
and its coalition partners got a total of 123: Social Action Party
54; the Democrat Party 48 and Citizens' Party 21.
   Interior Minister Prachuab Soontrangkul said 16.9 million of the
26.6 million eligible voters participated.
   Sixteen parties entered 3,606 candidates and only one party
failed to win representation in Parliament. The main opposition
group, the Thai Citizens' Party, won 31 seats.
   The Thai Unity party gained 35 seats and was considered a
possible coalition member, but party leader Narong Wongwan told
Thai journalists he would not join a ``Prem coalition.''
   Thai elections center largely on personalities, not political
platforms, and the main question in this election was whether Prem
should continue in office.
   Despite the factionalism in his government, Prem has had the
support of three of the nation's most powerful institutions: the
military, bureaucracy and monarchy.

<HEAD>Brezhnev Relative To Stand Trial in September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son-in-law of the late Soviet President Leonid
I. Brezhnev will stand trial in September on charges of giving and
accepting bribes, it was reported Monday.
   The government daily newspaper Izvestia said the Military
Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court on Monday determined there is
sufficient evidence to put Yuri Churbanov on trial with eight other
people. It said the trial would begin in early September but did
not give an exact date.
   The evidence against the nine defendants is contained in 110
volumes, the newspaper reported.
   The Tass news agency had said in January that a bribery and
corruption investigation of Churbanov, who is in his 50s, had been
completed.
   Churbanov married Galina Brezhnev while her father was party
leader and was appointed in 1980 as deputy interior minister, a
post that is in the department overseeing uniformed police and
issuance of travel and emigration visas.
   He was removed from the post three years ago for what was said
at the time to be preparation for transfer to other, unspecified
work. But he was arrested last year and accused of corruption and
bribe-taking.
   The Soviet press has carried detailed reports in recent months
about the investigation at a time when Brezhnev, who served from
1964 until his death in 1982, has come under increasing criticism
for leading the country during a ``period of stagnation'' when the
economy sagged and cronyism and corruption prevailed.
   The Tass news agency has reported that Churbanov is accused of
accepting bribes totaling more than $1.1 million, equivalent to 270
years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker.
   The labor newspaper Trud reported June 18 that Churbanov is
accused of providing well-paid protection to police in the Soviet
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan who had killed, raped,
extorted and robbed at will.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Thursday that
Galina Brezhnev and other relatives of the late Kremlin chief have
been stripped of unmerited privileges and will receive only the
retirement benefits they earned.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Vietnamese officials opened
talks Monday on accounting for 1,761 American servicemen still
missing from the Vietnam War, an American official said Monday.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said he had no
details on the talks, being held in Vietnam's capital of Hanoi and
expected to last four days.
   Vietnam on July 13 returned 25 remains it identified as those of
U.S. servicemen killed in the war. Hanoi also handed over a list of
names and ``associations'' relating to the remains. Some of the
names appear on the official list of 1,761 Americans who remain
missing in action from the war.
   The turnover was the fifth since retired Gen. John W. Vessey,
acting as a special presidential envoy, reached an agreement in
Hanoi a year ago under which Vietnam would accelerate the search
for remains, especially several dozen on Washington's top priority
list.
   This week's talks were agreed upon during a meeting at the
Untied Nations on June 8 between Vessey and Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach.
   The U.S. technical team was led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey of the
U.S. Embassy's Joint Casualty Resolution Center and joined by
representatives from the U.S. Army Central Identification
Laboratory based in Hawaii, the official said.
   ``We look forward to the results of the July 25-28 meeting
between technical representatives. We hope progress can be made
quickly on resolving this longstanding problem of concern to the
POW-MIA families of U.S and American people,'' the official quoted
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley as saying Thursday
in Washington.
   Since the war ended, Vietnam has returned more than 150 sets of
remains that the army laboratory has confirmed as Americans.
Vietnam says it has returned the remains of 241 missing Americans
and information on 45 others whose remains were ``determined to be
no longer in existence.''

<HEAD>TV Station Reports Hezbollah Plans To Kidnap Another German</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German television station
reported Monday the radical Shiite Moslem group Hezbollah, on
orders from Iran, was preparing to kidnap another West German in
Beirut.
   SAT-1, a cable television station, said it obtained a copy of a
telegram in Arabic from Hezbollah security officials in Iran to the
military attache at the Iranian Embassy in the Lebanese capital.
   Hezbollah has never claimed it holds foreign hostages in
Lebanon. But Hezbollah in Beirut is believed to be an umbrella for
the Shiite groups who hold 18 foreign captives, including a West
German.
   SAT-1 did not say how it obtained the document, but said it
showed personnel at the West German Embassy in Beirut ``were in the
gravest danger.''
   According to SAT-1, the telegram said:
   ``We want to inform you that we now have received sufficient
addresses and information about the embassy of the Federal Republic
(West Germany). We will tell you about the action plan as soon as
possible, which we, with the help of our people in East Beirut,
will carry out in accordance with your orders.''
   SAT-1 said the telegram had been sent sometime in March, but did
not give other details. It said that although the telegram was
months old, unidentified experts considered the threat to be
current.
   West German Rudolf Cordes has been held hostage since January
1987. Another West German taken captive that month was released
earlier.
   A Lebanese man, Abbas Hamadi, has been convicted in the
kidnappings. Officials say he hoped to win the release of his
brother, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a hijacking suspect who is on trial
in West Germany. A third Hamadi brother is security chief for
Hezbollah in Beirut.

<TEXT>
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Monday that while it's likely President Reagan will veto Congress'
latest attempt to require employers to give workers advance notice
of layoffs or plant shutdowns, `it's always open until it's done.''
   Fitzwater told reporters the bill, which passed both the House
and Senate earlier this month by veto-proof margins, had arrived at
the White House, and that Reagan has until Aug. 3 to make a
decision.
   The spokesman said the issue was likely to be raised at a
meeting Reagan will hold Tuesday with Republican congressional
leaders, but he disputed suggestions that GOP lawmakers will urge
the president to sign the bill.
   ``I would say there are number of them who will recommend a
veto,'' Fitzwater said.
   Last week, White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein told
reporters in Santa Barbara, Calif. that a Reagan veto was likely.
Meanwhile, the administration's stand on the issue was repeatedly
assailed by Democrats at their national convention in Atlanta.
   Duberstein said ``our longstanding position has been that it is
unacceptable to the president, that he has signaled veto, he has
vetoed it once already as part of another bill and I would suspect
that position will be maintained.''
   But during the daily White House news briefing Monday, Fitzwater
left the door slightly ajar.
   ``Duberstein said it was likely or most likely that he would
veto it,'' the spokesman said. ``I have said that from this podium.
That certainly is the case, but it's always open until it's done.''
   ``There are some congressional leaders who would like to give us
the benefits of their advice and this is an opportunity for them to
do it,'' Fitzwater said.
   A provision requiring private industry to give workers 60 days
advance notice of plant closings was contained in legislation
Congress passed earlier this year overhauling the nation's trade
laws.
   Reagan vetoed the bill, saying he didn't want the government
legislating restrictions on the ability of company executives to
make critical decisions. Reagan said the matter of worker
notification should be left to employers and employees to work out
separately.
   Vice President George Bush, certain to get the Republican
nomination for president in New Orleans next month, has stated
sentiments similar to Reagan's on the issue, although there have
been reports the Bush campaign would prefer to see the president
let the bill become law.
   Fitzwater said Monday he didn't know anything about whether the
Bush campaign was arguing a case for the signing of the
plant-closing bill.

   The founders of a charity that grants
dying children their last wishes have agreed to pay a $50,000 fine
and disband to settle accusations they misused donations for
personal loans, excessive salaries and rental on an X-rated movie.
   Genie Project founders Michael and Suzanne Bates also were
accused of using the charity's money to lease a Cadillac and to pay
rent on their home.
   State Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman announced a
settlement Monday under which the Bateses admitted no wrongdoing
and agreed never to hold any office or directorship in a
Connecticut charity.
   The agreement was in the form of a judgment in Waterbury
Superior Court entered July 7, and final notice was received last
week at the attorney general's office, Lieberman said. A lawsuit
filed Sept. 12, 1985, accused the couple of violating state charity
laws.
   The charity raised $237,000 in 1984 and was accused of spending
only $10,000 on dying children that year.
   Michael Bates has paid $18,259 to the state Consumer Protection
Department and $5,298 has been seized from various banks,
Lieberman's office said. Suzanne Bates will pay $24,259 to the
state over 122 months and $5,000 worth of computer equipment will
be turned over to the department.
   The Bateses also were put on probation for two years in a
criminal case. They had been charged with providing false
information to the consumer department.
   The Bateses, who are divorced, couldn't be reached for comment.
There is no telephone listing for either, and their attorney wasn't
in his office Monday morning, his secretary said.

   Tibet's only comprehensive institute of higher
learning on Friday awarded diplomas to the remote mountain region's
first university graduates, it was reported Monday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 246 students graduated from
Tibet University, with 74 receiving bachelor's degrees in
literature, law and philosophy.
   The university, located in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, was
established in 1985 as Tibet's first full university. The region
also has a teacher's college.
   The university's 778 students are enrolled in eight departments,
and 14 of its 17 professors and associate professors are of Tibetan
nationality, Xinhua said.
   The Beijing government has tried to aid Tibet, one of China's
most impoverished and least developed areas, by building schools,
hospitals and roads and providing funds for industry.
   Relations between Tibetans and non-Tibetan Chinese remain
strained by a long history of confrontations climaxing in the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when leftists persecuted many Tibetans
and tried to suppress Tibetan religion and language.
   Last fall and again in March crowds led by Buddhist monks staged
anti-Chinese, pro-independence riots, but Beijing insists they
represented a small minority of Tibetans and that the lives of
Tibetans have improved markedly under communist rule.

Federal Reserve Board, warned on Monday.
   The bank, headed by Barber B. Conable, a former congressman from
New York, wants a U.S. pledge of $70.1 million a year over the next
six years for an increase in its capital.
   So far, 140 of the 151 governments that own the bank have
decided to contribute. Among the other countries that have not made
a pledge are Algeria, Cambodia, Vietnam and South Yemen.
   President Reagan has urged approval of the contribution. It has
been held up in Congress by disagreement over what should be done
to handle the bulk of the Third World's $1.2 trillion debt.
   Last year the bank got back more in repayments and interest from
Third World borrowers than it gave them in new loans. Bank
officials want to reverse that trend and increase lending to well
over $20 billion a year in the early 1990s.
   ``Our influence and leadership within the bank are certainly at
stake, and I would raise the question ... if the United States is
not going to participate in capital increases ... whether the bank
itself can survive over a long period of time,'' Volcker told a
news conference.
   He added that the bank could continue lending for a year or two
without new capital. The United States, as the biggest shareholder,
is expected to furnish more than 18 percent.
   ``But against the prospect of not getting their capital
replenished, it is not in the nature of the beast and would not be
responsible for them to continue lending at that rate of speed in
the face of a vote of no-confidence by their major shareholders,''
said Volcker, who left the Fed last year.
   A contribution has been endorsed by former presidents Carter,
Ford and Nixon. Last week they were joined by nine former
secretaries of the treasury.
   A group of supporters, the Bretton Woods Committee, is seeking
statements of backing from the major presidential candidates.

   Men dressed as policemen killed
an IRA man Monday while Cardinal John O'Connor of New York
delivered a sermon a mile away in which he implored Americans not
to romanticize Irish violence.
   Brendan Davidson, a member of Sinn Fein, the outlawed Irish
Republican Army's legal political wing, was shot in the head after
answering a knock on his door, police said.
   Davidson, 33, belonged to the Sinn Fein, the outlawed Irish
Republican Army's legal political wing. An IRA statement issued in
Belfast said he was one of its members.
   He was shot down 48 hours after an IRA bomb killed a Protestant
couple and their 6-year-old son, who had just driven across the
border from the Irish Republic.
   The IRA took responsibility but said the attack was on the wrong
target. Press reports suggested the intended victim may have been a
judge who drove past shortly afterward.
   O'Connor learned of Davidson's death after leaving Belfast to
deliver a sermon in Armagh.
   He said the killing, and Saturday's bombing, ``poignantly
brought into focus the stupidity, the irrationality of the cycle of
the violence. ... Where can this conceivably end? How this can
conceivably please almighty God?''
   Authorities said three men wearing police uniforms killed
Davidson and escaped in a red car.
   Sinn Fein said it did not believe policemen committed the crime,
but that the assailants could have had help from sympathizers in
the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the mainly Protestant police force
in the British province.
   When Davidson was shot on Friendly Street, the cardinal was at
St. Peter's Cathedral in the heart of Roman Catholic West Belfast,
deploring ``some on our own shores, some in my own country, who
romanticize violence when it is several thousand miles away, who
don't know what it does to a land, who don't know the insecurity
that it brings, who don't know how it keeps a people oppressed.''
   O'Connor, who is leading 300 Americans on a pilgrimage to pray
for peace in Ireland, returned to that theme at Armagh, in the
south of the province.
   Addressing an ecumenical congregation at St. Patrick's
Cathedral, he again denounced Americans who ``continue to
perpetuate the myth that this violence reflects the glory of
Ireland, that we can stand around pianos ad sing sentimental songs
and believe that what occurs today is in the tradition of the
martyrs and the saints.''
   The bombing Saturday was the fifth admitted blunder by the IRA
that has killed or wounded innocent civilians since November, when
11 Protestants at a war memorial ceremony were killed by a bomb
intended for British soldiers.
   At least 2,660 people have been killed since political and
sectarian warfare began in Northern Ireland in August 1969,
including 44 so far this year. The IRA wants to drive the British
from Northern Ireland and unite it with the predominantly Catholic
republic.
   ``The terrorism has got to be deplored on either side,'' Mayor
Edward I. Koch of New York, who is on the pilgrimage, told
reporters in Armagh. ``No one believes that, because the cardinal
and 300 pilgrims came from New York, that we were going to be
stopping terrorism. In fact the acts of terrorism underscore the
need for prayer.''
   Tom King, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, said: ``Every
murder is an atrocity, and just this weekend we've had a
particularly awful atrocity committed by the IRA, and the trouble
is, once one is committed, then somebody on the other extreme feels
the need to strike back.''
   He met with O'Connor and Koch separately and praised their
``intelligent and constructive interest,'' compared with what he
called the ``nonsense talked in America'' and ``ignorance of the
true situation in Northern Ireland.''
   O'Connor toured Divis Flats, the high-rise homes of some of
Belfast's most impoverished Catholics, on Sunday and urged American
investors to bring business and jobs to the area.
   He said he looked across the geographical divisions of the city,
which are based on religion, and ``I asked myself: Good Lord, where
is the rationale in this? How can we purport to be made in the
image and likeness of almighty God?''

<HEAD>Man Executed for Taking Bribes for Color TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man was executed Monday after being convicted
of taking bribes from companies speculating in much-coveted color
television sets, according to an official report.
   The Xinhua News Agency said Qiao Yonghong was executed for
receiving about $32,400 to help work units obtain color TVs.
   Qiao, an employee of the Beijing Communications and Electrical
Company, in one instance was given the equivalent of $10,800 for
selling 200 color TVs to a company.
   The demand for color TVs far exceeds supply, and profiteers able
to obtain sets can sell them on the black market for far more than
government-set retail prices.
   Qiao, 35, was arrested in September 1985 and sentenced to death
in March 1987. He appealed the verdict, but the Beijing Higher
People's Court last month upheld the lower court's ruling.
   The government has called for police and courts to deal harshly
with the rising number of economic criminals such as speculators,
profiteers and embezzlers.
   Execution in China is usually by bullet to the back of the head.

   President Reagan said today he's ready to talk
to Iran about American hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in
Lebanon ``if they're ready.''
   At the conclusion of a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring
young men selected by the American Legion to study politics and
government, Reagan was asked ``are you ready to talk to Iran about
the hostages? Is it time.''
   ``If they're willing and ready to talk, it's time,'' he said.
   An administration official said earlier today that despite a new
U.S. message last week, Iran still has not sent an ``authorized''
reply to American entreaties about talks on normalizing relations
after an eight-year lapse.
   The message reiterated U.S. desires to discuss ties with Tehran
and did not lay down conditions for a resumption of relations,
broken in April 1980, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the United States would like to talk to the Iranians
about ending the Persian Gulf war, the nine Americans held hostage
in Lebanon and terrorism.
   He said, however, that the United States had not imposed
conditions for talks.
   In any event, the official said, Tehran had not proposed an
``authorized representative'' to respond to the U.S. overtures.
   On Sunday, two senior U.S. officials said the administration
deserves much of the credit for Iran's acceptance of a cease-fire
in its long war with Iraq.
   ``This is a time, if not for bragging, at least it's been a time
for all of us to be proud that our policy has been a success,''
John Whitehead, deputy secretary of state, said.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci agreed and said a cease-fire
means the year-old policy of escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers
through the Persian Gulf will end ``as soon as we judge it safe
(and) prudent to do so.''
   But Carlucci, appearing on the NBC-TV program, ``Meet the
Press,'' refused to set a date for the reduction of Navy ships in
the waterway. There are 27 U.S. warships there, compared with the
five or six that patrolled the gulf before the convoys began.
   Carlucci also said improved U.S.-Iranian relations could lead to
the release of the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon by
Iranian-backed groups.
   Iran has accepted United Nations resolution 598, which calls for
a cease-fire in the eight-year war while the two sides try to
negotiate a lasting peace. Even as representatives of both
countries prepare to meet with U.N. officials, Iraq has launched a
new series of attacks against Iran.
   Whitehead, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' said, ``Certainly Iran's decision is not solely
attributable to U.S. policy, but our firmness of our military
presence in the gulf, our indication that we planned to stay there
as long as it was necessary, and at the same time our diplomatic
track, principally at the United Nations, has finally achieved
success.''
   Carlucci, asked about the impact of administration policy on
Iran, said, ``I think it's been quite significant. Don't forget
that (Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini has consistently
said that he was going to drive us from the gulf.''
   ``The fact that we have been resolute, that we have stood by our
friends, that we have stood by the principles of freedom of
navigation and that he has not been able to drive us from the gulf
has had a significant impact on Iranian thinking,'' Carlucci said.
   One result of a cease-fire will be an end to the Navy's
protection of tankers in the gulf, Carlucci said, although he
declined to be specific about when that would occur. The Navy has
run 49 convoys.
   ``It's a little hard to make that kind of judgment at this
point,'' he said when asked about a date.
   ``We want to watch the negotiations. We'd probably want to take
some reasonable interval to make certain that the cease-fire
holds,'' he said. ``But there's no desire to keep 27 ships there
any longer than possible. We would certainly draw down (the number
of U.S. ships) as soon as feasible.''
   Ending the war eventually could lead to better relations between
Iran and other nations, including the United States, both men said.
Iran has taken a number of steps in recent weeks to improve
relations with other countries.
   ``We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into a
dialogue with Iran,'' Carlucci said. ``All they have to do is
designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and
we'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, about
terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever is
appropriate.''
   Asked about reports the U.S. hostages might be released if the
war ends, Carlucci said, ``We're obviously not going to discuss any
quid pro quo, but if the Iranians want to talk to us about the
hostage situation and how they're going to go about influencing
their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about it. I'm not
in the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for the
hostages. That is contrary to our policy,''
   Whitehead, asked about the same reports, said, ``I have no
information (to indicate the reports are true).''
   But he added that Iran's acceptance of the U.N. resolution means
``we may be beginning a process in which we can begin a dialogue
with Iran about the subjects of grave concern to us, of which the
hostages and terrorism are at the very top of our agenda.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Sunday the hostage
situation is easy for Iran to resolve. ``All they have to do is
release them.''
   Fitzwater, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as
President Reagan returned from California, said, ``We are willing
to talk to anybody, anyplace, but we are not willing to negotiate.
We are not willing to pay ransom. There is no need.''

   Cardinal Jozef Glemp announced Monday he
plans to visit the Soviet republic of Byelorussia, his second trip
to the Soviet Union this year.
   Glemp, leader of Poland's Roman Catholic Church, gave no date
for the visit, but said it would be at the invitation of Russian
Orthodox Metropolitan Filaret.
   He said he also planned to invite Filaret to Warsaw.
   The primate was interviewed by state-run television upon
returning to Poland after a three-week visit to Rome, where he met
with Polish-born Pope John Paul II.
   Glemp visited Moscow in June during observances of the 1,000th
anniversary of Christianity in Russia.
   Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy competed for centuries in the
territory of the Byelorussion republic, much of which belonged to
Poland before World War II.
   Polish church sources have estimated there are 1 million to 2
million Soviet citizens of Polish-Catholic origins in Lithuania,
Byelorussia and the Ukraine.

<TEXT>
   Most of the Virgin
Island's 11,000 public employees took the day off Monday for
Hurricane Supplication Day, the day residents pray they won't get
hit by a hurricane.
   Hurricane Supplication Day, which marks the traditional start of
the hurricane season for the Caribbean island group, is one of 25
holidays Virgin Islanders observe each year.
   Another is Hurricane Thanksgiving Day, on Oct. 17, traditionally
the last day of the hurricane season and a day set aside for giving
thanks for sparing the U.S. territory from the storms.
   Even though the islands' civil defense service recognizes the
Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 30 to Nov. 30,
islanders still observe the traditional hurricane holidays.
   All government offices except for essential services such as
hospitals and the police and fire departments were closed on the
three islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John's.
   Banks and stores stayed open, however, and most people went
about their business as usual.
   Although the religious significance of the holiday is sometimes
lost, Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in Christiansted held two
hurricane supplication services Monday. ``We had a lot of people at
the second one,'' a receptionist said.
   Elroy Harrison, coordinator of the Virgin Islands Territorial
Emergency Management Agency, said the islands have not been hit by
a major hurricane since the 1950s.

   Movie idol Greta Garbo was said to
be in fine fettle Monday, contrary to a tabloid report that the
82-year-old actress was weakened by flu and has spent most of her
Swiss holiday in bed.
   ``She is doing fine,'' said a spokesman for the hotel in this

   The spokesman, who would not give his name, denied a report
Sunday in the Swiss tabloid Sonntagsblick that Miss Garbo has not
left the hotel since her arrival a month ago. He declined to give
details of her activities.
   Miss Garbo regularly visits Klosters, where a friend owns a

   The Hungarian professor who frustrated millions
with his Rubik's Cube is introducing his latest puzzle, which he
says even he hasn't solved.
   But Erno Rubik's failure is not the result of a lack of ability,
merely a lack of time to puzzle out the secrets of ``Rubik's
Clock,'' Melanie Bateman of Matchbox Toys, Ltd. said Monday.
   Rubik, 44, a professor of architecture and design at the Academy
of Arts and Crafts in Budapest, invented the Rubik's Cube as a
teaching aid.
   After its success, he founded a private business in conjunction
with the Hungarian government. The business has produced Rubik's
Magic, another puzzle, and a series of products with business
applications.
   His new toy requires a player to get 18 clocks on both sides of
a plastic disc to strike midnight simultaneously by twisting wheels
which turn some of the hands but not others, according to Ms.
Bateman. The new toy will be launched at a major toy store here
Saturday, she said.

   Grace Mirabella, outgoing editor of Vogue
magazine, said the way she found out about her surprise firing was
``very unstylish, for such a stylish place.''
   Speaking for the first time since the June 28 report that she
was being replaced, Ms. Mirabella, 58, told The New York Times in
an interview published Monday, ``I feel a little odd.''
   Ms. Mirabella learned of her replacement by House & Garden
editor Anna Wintour when a television station reported it would
happen by Aug. 1.
   Ms. Wintour, 38, is a former editor of British Vogue and prior
to that worked for three years as Ms. Mirabella's creative director
at Vogue.
   Ms. Mirabella told The Washington Post in an interview also
published Monday that she called Conde Nast Publications Chairman
S.I. Newhouse at home and he confirmed the report.
   Newhouse told the Times the change was made because it was time
to ``reposition Vogue for the '90s.'' He agreed the circumstances
were unfortunate.
   Ms. Mirabella took over in 1971 when Conde Nast fired its
flamboyant editor, Diana Vreeland. Ms. Mirabella has worked at the
magazine since she graduated from Skidmore College.

   Cambodia's warring parties held peace
talks Monday for the first time, but they apparently made no
progress on negotiating an end to the country's civil war.
   The two central problems to be tackled are the future of the
communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas and organizing elections for a new
Cambodian government.
   ``Although we have not solved any concrete problems, each side
has revealed its position to the other side,`` said Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen after talks with the three guerrilla groups, which
oppose his Vietnamese-installed government.
   The four Cambodian leaders gathered in the summer palace of the
late President Sukarno in Bogor, a mountain retreat 37 miles
outside Jakarta, for the so-called ``cocktail party'' of the
factions.
   ``This is a very preliminary stage,'' said Indonesia's Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas, who organized the meeting.
   On Monday, Hun Sen met with guerrilla leaders Khieu Samthan of
the communist Khmer Rouge, Son Sann of the Khmer People's National
Liberaton Front and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who represented his
father Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The four later were joined by representatives of Vietnam, its
close ally Laos and the foreign ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asia Nations _ Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
the Philippines and Brunei _ which is the main backer of the
guerrillas.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978 and by Western count
maintains more than 100,000 troops there, says it has withdrawn
several thousand soldiers. It has announced it will pull out 50,000
troops this year and the rest by early 1990.
   Hun Sen told reporters he presented a seven-point proposal for a
political settlement in Cambodia. The plan contains mostly
positions that already had been rejected by the guerrillas.
   It calls for maintaining the status-quo in Cambodia until
elections are organized to form a new government. Hun Sen has said
he cannot accept the guerrillas' demand that he dissolve his
government before the elections.
   Instead, he said he proposed forming a ``ntional reconciliation
council'' headed by Sihanouk to implement any peace agreements and
organize the elections.
   Sihanouk resigned July 10 as the president of the guerrilla
coalition because he said the Khmer Rouge were killing his men. He
arrived in Indonesia on Saturday as a guest of President Suharto,
but said he would not attend the Bogor talks.
   The prince is considered the central figure in a settlement and
future government, and Hun Sen said the leaders of all four
factions would meet him in Jakarta in the next few days.
   Hun Sen also demanded the dissolution of the Khmer Rouge, the
largest of the guerrilla forces.
   ``Only by eliminating the Khmer Rouge ... can we eliminate the
possibility of the Pol Pot regime returning to Cambodia,'' Hun Sen
said.
   From 1975 until Vietnam invaded, the fanatical Khmer Rouge
regime of Prime Minister Pol Pot killed hundreds of thousands of
people. Diplomats say the Khmer Rouge is storing arms for attacks
after the Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia.
   The meeting represents the first gathering of the four Cambodian
parties. Hun Sen and Sihanouk held two rounds of unsuccessful talks
since 1987, but Vietnam has never met with the factions of the
Cambodian resistance.
   Asked if he was happy with the talks, Vietnam's delegate,
Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said, ``I am optimistic. I don't
say happy, but optimistic.''
   Three Buddhist monks from the United States, Canada and France
chanted prayers for the success of the talks outside the Dutch
colonial palace where the meetings were held.
   Alatas said the meeting is to continue Tuesday and would last
``as long as it takes.'' The tentative schedule called for two days
of talks.

<HEAD>Former Illinois Congressman Who Voted for Nixon Impeachment Dies
at 80</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Robert N. McClory, an Illinois
Republican reluctantly thrust into the national spotlight for his
role in impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon, is
dead at age 80.
   McClory, who represented the Chicago suburbs in Congress for 20
years until 1982, collapsed at church Sunday and died a short time
later at George Washington University Hospital, his wife, Doris,
said Monday.
   ``He went out jogging, got a paper and then came back to go with
me to church. Everything was fine,'' Mrs. McClory said. ``Then it
happened. He just collapsed and never came out of it.''
   McClory was the second-ranking Republican on the House Judiciary
Committee during congressional hearings on the break-in at the
Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex
in Washington.
   Although he was a GOP loyalist, McClory was one of the leading
House supporters of an article of impeachment in 1974 charging
Nixon with abusing his constitutional powers in the Watergate
matter. He drafted another article charging the president with
contempt of Congress for resisting subpoenas.
   ``I feel really torn,'' McClory said in an interview at the
time. ``But I'm disassociating this job from my relationship with
the president on philosophy and policies.''
   During the impeachment hearings, McClory said he was not
convinced that Nixon was directly involved in the Watergate coverup
but rejected suggestions that he had a partisan obligation to
defend the president against all of the accusations.
   ``I have heard it said by some that they cannot understand how a
Republican could vote to impeach a Republican president,'' he said
in the committee's opening debate on impeachment. ``Let me hasten
to assert that that argument demeans my role here. It would make a
mockery of our entire inquiry.''
   Nixon resigned the presidency after the committee voted three
articles of impeachment.
   Born in Riverside, Ill., McClory graduated from Dartmouth
College and Chicago-Kent School of Law and practiced law in the
Chicago area until 1950 when he was elected to the Illinois House
of Representatives. He served in the state Senate from 1952 to 1962.
   While in Congress, McClory was a House manager of the Equal
Rights Amendment and a sponsor of legislation providing that
federal holidays such as Labor Day and Memorial Day be celebrated
on Monday.
   McClory's congressional district in the northern and western
suburbs of Chicago was eliminated by reapportionment in 1981.
Rather than opposing incumbent Rep. John Porter, also a Republican,
in the expanded 10th District, he chose not to seek re-election in
1982.
   ``He will be best remembered for his leadership during the
Watergate hearings and his abiding commitment to the rule of law,''
Porter said Monday. ``Along with tens of thousands of people from
our area, I share ... a tremendous sense of loss in Bob's passing.''
   McClory had lived in the nation's capital since leaving office
and was a member of the Washington law firm of Baker & McKenzie.
   He is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.
   McClory will be buried Friday following a private service in
Illinois, his wife said. She said a public memorial service was
scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at the United Methodist Church in
Lake Bluff, Ill., where he had maintained a home since the 1930s.

   A practice space shuttle countdown
hit a snag Monday, delaying a critical test-firing of Discovery's
three main engines 24 hours, until Sunday.
   The postponement was announced as engineers assessed methods for
fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to take Discovery
off the launch pad, a move that could delay the planned early
September launch by as much as two months.
   The launch team started the countdown late Sunday and fell
behind early in closing out the shuttle's rear engine compartment
on the pad. That forced a one-day delay in the loading of gases
aboard the spaceship's energy-producing fuel cells.
   The plan now calls for crews to pump more than half a million
gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Discovery's
external fuel tank late Wednesday and early Thursday.
   It will mark the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the
fleet was grounded by the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986.
   On Thursday, when the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock
liftoff, a simulated problem is to force a postponement. Crews then
will rehearse what they call a 72-hour launch turnaround exercise.
They will empty the fuel tank, start another countdown and aim for
a test-firing of Discovery's main engines at 7:30 a.m. Sunday.
   The 20-second firing, with the shuttle locked firmly on the pad,
will check modifications made to turbopumps and other engine
systems and is considered crucial to Discovery being certified for
the first post-Challenger shuttle flight.
   The launch, with a five-man crew, is scheduled for early
September, but the date is uncertain because of the leak in a
steering engine system that is separate from the main engines.
   NASA officials believe that even if the leak can be fixed on the
pad, the launch will be delayed past the middle of September.
   Experts were considering several ways to reach and plug the
inaccessible leak, from cutting a hole through the shuttle cargo
bay wall to running a snake-like tube 20 feet through the
half-inch-diameter gas line.
   Tests over the weekend ruled out using the tube in two
configurations. One would have used it to deliver an expandable
Teflon balloon filled with sealant to plug the leak. In the other,
sealant would been pumped through a hollow tube to the leak.
   The tube testing is being done at the Materials and Processing
Laboratory at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
Lab director Bob Schwinghamer said Monday the balloon and hollow
tube approaches proved impractical.
   But he said another approach, in which a badminton-like
shuttlecock is attached to the end of the ``snake,'' showed promise
in reaching the leak.
   ``We have tested it eight times successfully and it looks very
attractive,'' Schwinghamer said. He suggested that if this method
didn't work, NASA then could consider cutting a hole in the cargo
bay.

   Residents are ready to greet the
humming toadfish in its yearly mating ritual with a comparable
human sound: They're going to play kazoos.
   Until the humming toadfish was identified as living in
Richardson Bay in 1985, residents were baffled by a strange humming
sound coming from the water.
   The July 31 celebration will include more than 25 environmental
groups, as well as ecological and historical exhibits, lectures and
boat tours _ all in honor of the fish.
   The humming toadfish used to be an irritating puzzle that awoke
Sausalito houseboat residents nightly, beginning toward the end of
July.
   ``The first time it happened, practically everybody in the
houseboats jumped out of bed and looked in their electrical
boxes,'' said Suzanne Simpson, a festival spokeswoman and one of
the many houseboat residents who had no idea what the eerie buzzing
sound was when it first occurred in 1984.
   In their search for mates, the male fish emit the humming noise
and other buzzing sounds through vibrating gas bladders.

   Even though the two ``all-star'' softball
teams were playing in the Metrodome home of the Minnesota Twins,
there was no danger of mistaking them for baseball's 1987 world
champions.
   However, the benefit game Sunday between the Democratic Farmer
Labor and Independent Republican teams had some of the trappings of
major league baseball.
   There were at least four inside-the-park home runs and some
spectacular fielding plays during the game won by the IR team,
20-13.
   A pitcher suspected of scuffing the softball was even ejected
for allegedly concealing a huge wad of sandpaper while on the mound
in the manner of Twins pitcher Joe Niekro. Niekro was suspended for
10 days last year after being caught with an emery board and
sandpaper on the mound in Anaheim, Calif.
   The softball game was billed as a benefit between IR
politicians, led by former state Rep. David Jennings, chairman of
George Bush's Minnesota campaign, and DFLers, who were led by
co-captains U.S. Rep. Martin Sabo and state Rep. Phyllis Kahn. Each
group sold about 500 $12 tickets.
   About 400 of the 38,008 fans who attended the Twins-Orioles game
stayed to watch the slapstick game.
   Kahn, the DFL co-captain and starting pitcher, was resplendent
in iridescent purple, pink and green plaid shorts. She had some
trouble controlling her pitches and was replaced in the second
inning after yielding 11 runs.
   ``The most important thing, in politics as well as baseball, is
to know when it's time to move on,'' Kahn said.
   In the fifth inning, with the IRs leading 12-8, Sabo complained
about the IR pitcher, state Rep. Chris Tjornhom, and asked the
umpire to check for illegalities.
   Sabo accompanied the umpire to the mound, where a large piece of
sandpaper fell to the ground next to the pitcher. Tjornhom, looking
indignant, was ejected.

   The federal government introduced legislation
Monday to start implementing a $5.3 billion day care program that
would double the number of spaces across the country to 400,000 in
seven years.
   Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has said he will give
the bill priority ahead of an anticipated fall election.
   Health Minister Jake Epp promised the legislation in December
and is negotiating with Canada's 10 provincial governments to share
program costs.
   The bill introduced Monday would create a $3.3 billion fund to
help the provinces set up 200,000 new day care spaces by 1995.
Separate legislation will give tax breaks to all working parents
who enroll their children in day care facilities.

<HEAD>Delegate Says Burmese Leader's Resignation Accepted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's ruling political party on Monday
accepted the resignation of strongman Ne Win after 26 years as head
of the party, but opposed his call for a referendum on ending
one-party rule, a delegate said.
   At the final session of a three-day congress, the ruling Burma
Socialist Program Party also considered sweeping economic reforms
designed to cure the country's deepening economic woes.
   The 77-year-old Ne Win, who came to power in a 1962 military
coup, announced abruptly Saturday he was resigning. He cited bloody
anti-government rioting in March and June and his age as key
factors in his decision.
   Ne Win has been blamed for leading Burma into economic disaster
during 26 years of isolationist policies.
   Five veteran party leaders also submitted their resignations
Saturday.
   The party delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the 1,061 delegates at the congress voted to accept Ne Win's
resignation and that of party vice chairman San Yu, also the
country's president, but to retain them as ``inactive members.''
   Official Radio Rangoon did not announce the decision,
broadcasting only remarks by party General Secretary Aye Ko saying
some delegates to the congress had favored approving the
resignations.
   Political analysts speculated the official silence indicated
division within party ranks on the course of the country.
   Ko also said the delegates rejected the resignations submitted
by four of the party leaders because they were ``still young and
energetic.''
   The four included Aye Ko, party joint general secretary Sein
Lwin and central executive committee members Tun Tin and Kyaw Htin.
All hold senior government positions.
   In its broadcast, Radio Rangoon said the delegates had empowered
the party's central committee to consider sweeping proposals for
economic reform. Th radio did not say whether a decision had been
taken.
   In his remarks, Aye Ko said 15 delegates expressed opposition to
holding the proposed referendum on one-party rule on the grounds
that a 1973 referendum already had institutionalized it.
   The state radio announced Sunday that an emergency parliament
session would convene Wednesday, apparently to act on the
referendum proposal.
   According to Burmese law, the parliament is empowered to rule on
the referendum by majority vote. In the past, the parliament has
rubber-stamped most of the ruling party's decisions.
   The emergency session Wednesday could also deal with the
appointment of a new president to replace San Yu.
   Exactly when Ne Win will be replaced or by whom remains unclear.
Analysts have said a likely candidate would be Maung Maung Kha, the
prime minister since 1977. Maung Maung Kha has generally not been
regarded as an effective leader.
   Many western diplomats doubt that Ne Win, who has been in
undisputed control of the country for so long, will remain far
removed from policy decisions even after he leaves the government.
   The sudden and unexpected developments in Burma came in the wake
of bloody anti-government riots that have rocked Rangoon and other
cities three times since October. Martial law is still in effect in
Prome, 180 miles north of the capital, following riots there last
week.
   During his 26-year rule, Ne Win not only crushed anti-government
opposition but moved against leaders within his own ranks when they
exhibited what he saw as too much independence.
   He also is blamed for turning resource-rich Burma into one of
the nation's 10 poorest countries with an annual per capita income
of less than $200.
   In a speech Sunday, Aye Ko admitted economic production had
declined, working skills had deteriorated and ``losses and waste
cannot be controlled effectively.''
   ``Because of these weaknesses and as a result of adverse
repercussions from the world economic conditions today, the state
economic situation is declining,'' he said.
   He called for an end to state control of many sectors and for
allowing joint ventures between Burmese entrepreneurs and foreign
investors. Ne Win banned such ventures shortly after seizing power.

   Military officials from Angola, Cuba, South
Africa and the United States met on an island off the coast of
Africa to discuss the next moves in an evolving peace accord in
southwestern Africa, the State Department confirmed Monday.
   The United States, which is acting as a mediator, was
represented at the July 22-23 meeting by a joint delegation from
the Defense and State departments headed by James L. Woods, the
deputy assistant secretary of defense for African affairs, State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   Redman said the talks on the island of Cape Verde were
``complementary'' to the diplomatic negotiations under way for a
withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from Angola and
independence for South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   A further round of political-level talks will be held between
the sides in Geneva next week. Although Cuba, Angola and South
Africa have accepted the principle of withdrawal, they are still
wrangling over timetables.
   Redman did not elaborate on what the military officials
discussed at the meeting, which was first disclosed over the
weekend by the Portuguese news agency, LUSA.
   One of the matters which probably was on the agenda is the
proximity of some of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops to South
African forces in southern Angola.
   U.S. officials have voiced concern that the two sides might
clash, thereby escalating the conflict and scuttling the diplomatic
breakthrough.

   A man charged with illegally aiding
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels pleaded innocent Monday and said his
operations were approved ``all the way to the top'' of the White
House.
   Jack Terrell, 47, is one of seven men indicted on charges of
violating the U.S. Neutrality Act by secretly aiding the Contras in
1984 and 1985.
   ``This is a case of right and wrong,'' Terrell said after
appearing before a federal magistrate. ``The soldiers are going to
be hung and the generals will walk.''
   Terrell's attorney, John Mattes, questioned why former National
Security Council aide Oliver North and other Reagan administration
figures connected to the Iran-Contra arms deal were not charged in
the case, which covers a period when Congress had banned military
aid to the Contras.
   Knowledge and approval of the aid operation ``went all the way
to the top'' of the White House, said Terrell. Asked if he meant
the president, Terrell repeated his statement.
   The former mercenary, who used the code name ``Colonel Flaco,''
said he received about $100,000 for the operations and added: ``it
did not come from private sources.''
   Terrell's defense also showed a document declassified during the
congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra affair, saying it
supports their contention that North was aware of the secret
activities.
   The Jan. 27, 1985, memo to North, which is unsigned but which
the defense says came from North's aide Robert Owen, specifically
mentions Terrell's co-defendant Tom Posey, head of Civilian
Materiel Assistance of Alabama.
   The memo says ``Posey is sending 4 people to (censored) to help
with the training,'' and asks North's approval of their departure
date.
   It adds that Flaco ``is going to be working with the Indians,''
an apparent reference to the anti-Sandinista Miskito Indians on
Nicaragua's eastern coast.
   Terrell said it was that operation that led to his
disenchantment with the government's anti-Contra policies.
   ``They were not interested in getting Nicaragua back,'' Terrell
said. ``They were interested in creating a situation in which the
American military would have to come in.''
   He said North had him thrown out of his base in Honduras ``with
Uzi submachine guns pointed at our heads'' because his operations
were ``getting off the railroad track.''
   Terrell later began speaking out against Reagan administration
policy on Nicaragua, and in subsequent memos North wrote that he
had to be stopped.
   A Terrell co-defendant, Joe Adams, was sentenced Friday to one
day of probation and fined $50 by U.S. District Judge Norman
Roettger, who could have sentenced him to 33 years in prison.
   Terrell faces the same possible penalty as Adams, but said he
would not plead guilty despite Adams' lenient treatment.
   ``I won't take a felony,'' said Terrell.
   Mattes said the defense would subpoena witnesses and documents
from government agencies, including the CIA and the National
Security Council.

<HEAD>Official Says Captains of Sub, Fishing Boat Share Blame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captains of a Japanese submarine and a pleasure
fishing boat probably share blame for a weekend collision that
killed nine people and left 21 missing, a Maritime Safety Agency
official said Monday.
   A senior defense official said the submarine's crewmen should
have done more to save the people in the fishing boat and were slow
to notify rescue officials.
   The 2,200-ton sub Nadashio and the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru
collided head-on Saturday southwest of Tokyo while the submarine
was running on the surface.
   Some of the 48 people on the boat were thrown into the water and
the boat sank in two minutes. Those missing are presumed dead.
   No injuries were reported among the sub's 75 crewmen.
   ``The investigation isn't complete yet, but it looks like both
vessels were partly responsible for the accident,'' the MSA
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Divers recovered the bodies of three more victims Monday in the
waters near Yokosuka, about 30 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Rescue officials said 200 divers were searching for the 21
people still missing and others were on the ocean floor, attaching
cables to the hull of the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru so it could be
raised.
   Seiki Nishihiro, vice minister of state for defense, said the
sub's crew was slow to tell rescue officials of the accident
because its communications equipment only allowed it to talk to
naval headquarters, not to the safety agency.
   Men on the sub should have ``grabbed three or four life
preservers, if they were available, and jumped into the water'' to
save people from the fishing boat, Nishihiro told reporters.
   Twenty-one minutes elapsed before the safety agency was told of
the collision, according to news reports.
   Sixteen of the 19 people rescued were picked up by passing
vessels and only three by the submarine, the reports said. One of
those rescued died later.
   The Nadashio was crossing a busy shipping lane to enter Yokosuka
naval base and was trying to avoid hitting a yacht when it collided
with the boat, which a company fishing club had chartered for the
weekend, Adm. Shuichiro Higashiyama said Sunday.
   He said the fishing boat had not made an unexpected turn.
   Japanese maritime rules require the ship approaching from the
left to take evasive action when two vessels appear to be on a
collision course, with the other maintaining its course unless an
accident is imminent.
   In Saturday's accident, the sub was approaching from the left
and took such action, but the fishing boat also turned and a
collision resulted.
   ``If the No. 1 Fujimaru had not turned to the left, there would
not have been a collision,'' a Defense Agency official quoted
Higashiyama as saying. ``I believe the submarine commander took the
most appropriate measures to avoid an accident.''

<HEAD>Researchers Identify Genetic Defects That Lead To Colon Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have identified genetic
mutations that lead to the development of colon cancer, a critical
step toward the development of better treatments for a form of
cancer that kills 53,500 Americans annually.
   ``You can look at these genetic alterations as the causes of
cancer _ just as you can look at bacteria as the causes of
infection,'' said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine in Baltimore. ``Except it's more
complicated in cancer.''
   Just as the polio virus had to be discovered before the polio
vaccine could be developed, so these genetic changes must be found
before cancer can be prevented, Vogelstein said Monday in a
telephone interview.
   Research so far suggests that perhaps as many as seven genetic
mutations must occur for olon cancer tumors to appear, Vogelstein
said.
   Five of those changes have now been identified, said Ray White
of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Utah in
Salt Lake City.
   Speaking Monday at The Jackson Laboratory here, White said that
colon cancer appears to be caused both by the activation of known
cancer genes and by the failure of certain anti-cancer genes.
   ``The steps in the pathway are starting to be filled in,'' White
said.
   Understanding how these genetic changes produce colon tumors may
allow doctors to distinguish between more severe and less severe
forms of colon cancer in individuals, White said, and could one day
lead to better cancer drugs.
   White has been one of the leaders in the study of the
anti-cancer genes that protect against cancer _ the so-called
recessive oncogenes.
   One such gene, identified in a rare form of eye cancer, has now
been linked to breast cancer and to a common form of lung cancer,
White said.
   Another such gene was found by White in families with a rare
kind of inherited colon cancer.
   Now, he said, failures of that anti-colon cancer gene have been
found to occur in about half of the much more common form of colon
cancer that is not inherited.
   Similarly, Vogelstein said he has found two specific genetic
variations in at least 75 percent of people with colon cancer.
   He has also found that a long-known cancer gene called the K-ras
gene is altered in about half of the colon cancer cases he has
studied.
   ``That kind of mutation is probably very important for the
development of colon cancer,'' Vogelstein said. ``And it suggests
some relationship between environmental influences and cancer.''
   Cancer is known to be caused, in part, by exposure to
carcinogens in the environment, he explained. Such carcinogens
could be triggering some of the genetic mutations that he and White
are finding, he said.
   White said that some of these changes may produce polyps in the
colon. These polyps, of the type that President Reagan has had
removed, are thought to represent tissue in which some _ but not
all _ of the colon cancer genetic mutations are present.
   Vogelstein said statistical studies of colon cancer suggest that
perhaps no more than seven genetic mutations are required to
produce colon cancer tumors.
   With five of those changes now identified, researchers may be
close to identifying all of the principal genetic causes of colon
cancer, he said, opening the way to research on new and better
treatments for this disease.

   An owner of a printing plant faces
forgery charges in a scheme to print and sell $3 million in $50 and
$100 bills, a federal agent said Monday.
   ``We believe we got all of it, that none of it was put into
circulation,'' said Stewart Henry of the Secret Service's regional
office in Boston.
   Richard P. Edmands, a Watertown resident and co-owner of the
Reproprint Co., was to be arraigned Monday on charges of
manufacturing counterfeit U.S. currency and possession of forgery
plates and tools, Henry said.
   Edmands was arrested Sunday when an undercover Secret Service
agent went to Reproprint after arranging to pay $50,000 in cash for
the $3 million in counterfeit bills, Henry said.
   ``The quality was average to good. They were very passable,''
Henry said. The quality of a forged bill depends largely on the
quality of the camera that is used to produce a negative from which
the printing plates are made, he said.
   ``The paper did not contain the red and blue security fibers,
but it was a good rag paper,'' Henry said. The U.S. Treasury uses
special dies and fibers to make U.S. currency difficult to
duplicate.
   Henry said he could not comment on what led to the investigation.

   What kind of beauty pageant would give its

   The United States Cultured Pearl Pageant _ because the $70,000
pearl tiara intended for the winner was swiped three days earlier
at John F. Kennedy International Airport, pageant officials said
Monday.
   When 22-year-old Carol Carter of Bossier City, La., won the
title Sunday night, she received a crown ``hastily assembled by the
cultured pearl industry,'' said Freddy Kohn, president of the
Cultured Pearl Association of America.
   The stolen crown was part of a shipment of jewelry worth nearly
$1 million retail stolen Friday as it was unloaded, police said.
The jewelry was shipped here from Japan.

   Personal mementos of America's seven
original Mercury spacemen will be displayed in the U.S. Astronaut
Hall of Fame to be built near this spaceport, former astronaut Alan
B. Shepard announced Monday.
   Shepard, the first American to fly in space and president of the
Mercury Seven Foundation, told a news conference the Hall of Fame
``will explain space travel from the astronauts' point of view''
through photographs, displays of training equipment, personal log
books, clothing and souvenirs of the nation's first corps of
astronauts.
   He said the attraction, to be opened in 1990, will share an
18-acre complex with the permament location of the U.S. Space Camp
of Florida and a 200-room hotel. It will be in Titusville, just
outside the gates of the Kennedy Space Center.
   The Space Camp, nearing the end of its first season, has been in
a temporary leased building. About 3,600 youngsters in grades 4
through 7 signed up for 3- and 5-day classes during the first year.
   Besides Shepard, the Mercury astronauts, named in 1959, were
Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally
Schirra and Deke Slayton.
   Grissom, as a member of the Apollo 1 crew, died in a launch pad
fire in 1967. The others are active in the Mercury Seven
Foundation, which operates the Florida Space Camp and funds college
scholarships in science and technology.

   Workers dusted off idled machinery, shops reopened
and buses rolled Monday as Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh quit a
two-month strike that failed to persuade the Kremlin to transfer
the region to the control of a neighboring republic.
   One resident said Armenians won't give up despite the Soviet
leadership's rejection a week ago of their demand to take
Nagorno-Karabakh out of the republic of Azerbaijan and annex it to
Armenia.
   ``The decision has done little for us and we will continue this
fight to the end. But what is the sense of continuing to strike?''
said an engineer for the State Broadcasting Committee in
Stepanakert, the main city in the Delaware-sized disputed region.
   The decision by Armenians to end the protest strikes marks a
victory for the Kremlin in its drive to end the region's turmoil
that erupted in February.
   The strikes have devastated the local economy. The Tass news
agency reported Monday that at one Stepanakert factory, lighting
fixtures worth more than $7.9 million had not been produced since
the work stoppage began May 23. The factory director was quoted as
saying employees will work overtime to make up for the lost
production.
   Tass said 78.5 percent of the employees reported to work at
Stepanakert's 15 major factories.
   But the news agency said it will take time to resume full
production at the long-idled plants.
   Workers at a Stepanakert silk factory spent two hours Monday
morning cleaning a thick layer of dust from their looms and have
other maintenance work to do before production is back to normal,
Tass reported.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's parliament,
decided July 18 that Nagorno-Karabakh, whose population of 162,000
is predominantly Armenian and Christian, will remain part of the
mostly Moslem Azerbaijani republic to which it has been attached
since 1923.
   The Presidium, or executive committee, also decided to dispatch
a representative to Nagorno-Karabakh to help authorities implement
a plan approved in March for improving social and cultural
facilities, primarily for Armenians. Soviet TV reported Monday that
Arkady I. Volsky, a 56-year-old member of the policy-making Central
Committee and a Supreme Soviet deputy, would go to the region.
   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh began sporadic strikes and rallies
in February to press for annexation with Armenia, contending they
suffered discrimination under the Azerbaijanis. Strikes and rallies
also erupted in Armenia in support of the demand.
   Tass said buses began running again, food stores and other
businesses reopened, and construction workers returned to their
jobs Monday in Stepanakert.
   ``Today people went to work,'' the broadcast engineer said in a
telephone interview. ``Transport is operating and we have ended our
strikes.'' She declined to give her name.
   The region's Communist Party officials traveled to the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku to discuss with the republic's leaders
``efforts at restoring a normal working rhythm and strenghtening
socialist legality and public order,'' Tass said.
   In the Armenian capital of Yerevan, most workers were reported
back on the job after a strike that began July 4 and tapered off
after last week's decision.

   Sikh extremists Monday opened fire at
three leaders of the Golden Temple, killing the head priest and a
second official, and seriously injuring a third, police said.
   Police identified the dead as head priest Sohan Singh and Bhan
Singh, secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee,
which manages Sikhism's holiest shrine in the city of Amritsar,
police said.
   The head of the committee, Mal Singh Ghuman, suffered four
bullet wounds and was hospitalized in critical condition, police
said.
   According to police, the Sikh extremists armed with a AK-47
Chinese rifle sprayed gunfire at the three men at noon on a street
in Ludhiana, about 55 miles west of the state capital of
Chandigarh. Police said the gunmen fled on a motorcycle.
   The three were shot as they emerged from a board meeting of an
engineering college, Indian news agencies said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. A
statewide manhunt was launched for the killers, said a Ludhiana
police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The temple committee appointed the 60-year-old Sohan Singh head
priest in May after police and troops forced more than 150 Sikh
extremists out of the Golden Temple, which the militants used as a
base to wage their guerrilla war for an independent homeland in the
northwestern state of Punjab. At least 42 people, most of them Sikh
radicals, were killed during the siege.
   The head priest's predecessor and four other Sikh high priests,
who were jailed during the operation, remain in custody.
   The appointment of Singh, a moderate, was opposed by the
militants, who also objected to the priest's efforts to exonerate
Surjit Singh Barnala, former chief minister of Punjab. Barnala had
been excommunicated from the Sikh faith by radical priests in
charge of the temple after he defied their order to merge his
moderate political party with the militants.
   Police reported four other deaths in extremist violence in
Punjab.
   The latest victims raised to 1,560 the number of people killed
by Sikh militants in Punjab this year. An estimated 690 of those
killed have been Sikhs.
   The Sikh religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's population, but they are a majority in Punjab.
The Sikh militants claim they are being discriminated against by
India's majority Hindus.

<HEAD>FDA Ruling On Import Of AIDS Treatment Drugs Gives Hope To Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN VEGA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's decision to allow those
who suffer from AIDS to import unproved drugs is a response to the
gay community's frustrations about the search for a cure to the
deadly disease, according to advocates for AIDS victims.
   Larry Gostin, an attorney with the Harvard School of Public
Health, called the new program ``a signal advance in recognizing
the gay and IV-drug constituencies that have been calling for
this'' and grants AIDS patients ``a little bit of hope and
reprieve.''
   The government last week officially began allowing AIDS patients
to import drugs not approved for sale in the United States, as long
as the drugs are for personal use.
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Frank E. Young
revealed the change Saturday to a hostile crowd at the Second
International Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS Forum in
Boston. He said the policy would also apply to drugs for other
diseases.
   ``It's almost a shock because it's so contrary to the character
and the tradition of the FDA,'' said
   ``It allows AIDS patients to make some choices about their own
treatment,'' said Ellen Ratner, president of the National Lesbian
and Gay Health Foundation, which is sponsoring the conference on
gay health issues.
   ``If you're dying, you don't have a lot of choices,'' Ratner
said.
   The FDA had been repeatedly criticized by advocates of AIDS
patients who say the government is not moving quickly enough to
develop and test new drugs to treat the fatal, incurable disease.
   Increasingly desperate patients have been eager to try
experimental treatment, and Young said the FDA was changing its
policy even though scientists believe many of the drugs have not
been proved safe and effective.
   ``From the AIDS person's point of view, they have nothing to
lose and what they need is just some little optimism in their life.
If there's a risk, I think that they should be able to make the
decision about whether to assume that risk,'' Gostin said Sunday.
   Winfield Scott, associate dean for education at George
Washington University Medical Center, said the change responds to
gay community's frustration ``that answers aren't coming more
quickly.''
   Scott cautioned that although activists focus on the bureaucracy
as if the bureaucracy was the problem, ``The real problem is that
nature is very slow and reluctant to yield up her secrets.''
   Young said the FDA had previously allowed unapproved drugs to be
imported on an informal basis. One such drug was dextran sulfate,
which the federal government is only now beginning to test in human
trials as a treatment for AIDS.
   The FDA's new policy will insure that people in need can import
a small supply, generally enough for three months of treatment. The
drugs must be only for personal use and not for sale.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a
virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring.
   Homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the
68,220 U.S. AIDS cases counted by the government since June 1981.
There have been 38,541 deaths, or 56 percent of the total cases,
the Centers for Disease Control reported last week.

<HEAD>Dairy Men, Cattle Producers Feuding Over Drought Relief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A simmering feud between beef producers and
dairymen has surfaced as Congress wrestles with legislation to aid
drought-stricken farmers.
   A group of beef cattlemen based in Texas has asked Congress to
limit concessions to the dairymen, while the nation's largest dairy
farm cooperative says additional government help is necessary to
avoid milk shortages and higher prices at the grocery store.
   James L. Powell, president of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle
Raisers Association in Fort Worth has asked Texas congressmen,
including House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, to
oppose concessions to the dairymen that extend beyond suspension of
a 50-cent cut in milk price supports and existing drought relief
assistance programs.
   Those programs include haying and grazing on land set aside from
production and government-subsidized feed expenses in
drought-stricken counties.
   ``Further concessions are unwarranted,'' Powell wrote de la
Garza, a Democrat, in a July 20 letter.
   Jim Eskin, spokesman for Associated Milk Producers Inc. of San
Antonio, Texas, the nation's largest dairy farm cooperative, said
the group is asking Congress to not only suspend the 50-cent cut in
price supports, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1., but to increase
price supports by about $1.06 per 100 pounds of milk.
   The dairy association contends the additional support is
necessary to offset increasing feed costs caused by the drought,
Eskin said Monday. Other industry officials say production has also
been decreased because of the heat.
   A failure to act would be ``shortsighted'' and could result in
``letting milk production drop to dangerously low levels, which
could lead to runaway prices for years to come,'' Eskin said.
   If farmers can't afford or obtain feed they may be forced to
slaughter their herds, which can take three years to rebuild, he
said.
   He said there has been ``heavy movement of dairy cattle to
slaughter, further documenting a rapidly deteriorating situation.''
   The House Agriculture Committee is scheduled to complete action
on drought-relief legislation Tuesday, with the bill possibly being
considered by the full House on Thursday.
   Jim Sumner, spokesman for Dairymen Inc., said the Louisvlle,
Ky., cooperative is reporting shortages this week, and is 81-tanker
trailers of milk below what is needed to fill orders in the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.
   Powell said the cattle raisers don't think the dairymen ``should
be given favorable treatment over and above any other segment of
agriculture. We're trying to maintain a level playing field for all
agriculture.''
   ``The secretary of agriculture has enough authority to deal with
the drought situation. We're not really certain you need additional
legislation,'' Powell said.
   The dairymen and beef-cattle producers have been at odds off and
on for several years, partly over an 18-month whole-herd buyout of
dairy cattle that began April 1, 1986. About 1.22 million cows,
heifers and calves were sold, mostly for slaughter and some for
export, during the buyout. Dairy farmers collected about $1.8
billion in subsidies and about 38 percent of that cost was paid for
by dairy farmers themselves through milk marketing fees levied on
all producers. The subsidies, however, went to only those in the
program.
   The cattle producers contended the buyout flooded the market
with beef and depressed prices.
   Don King, general manager of the Texas and Southwest Cattle
Raisers, contends an increase in price supports could encourage
production and lead to another whole-herd dairy buyout.
   ``We've already gone through that ringer two years ago,'' he
said.
   A national consumer group, Public Voice for Food and Health
Policy, also said drought-hurt dairy farmers deserve some federal
aid, such as feed assistance, but ``legislating a higher dairy
support price is not justifiable.''
   ``Once again, the dairy producers are going whole hog for a
special deal that would cost Americans more as taxpayers and a
consumers,'' said Public Voice executive director Ellen Haas. ``And
higher food prices impact hardest on those least able to pay.
Mandating higher support prices for milk after feed costs slacken
would once again encourage overproduction and government costs.''

   President Reagan said Monday the time has come
for the United States to talk to Iran about Americans held hostage
in Lebanon, if Tehran's leaders are ``willing and ready.''
   Reagan did not elaborate, but an administration official noted
earlier in the day that the United States had sent a new message to
Iran last week asking about the possibility of talks aimed at
normalizing relations. Tehran still has not sent an ``authorized''
reply, the official said.
   The official, who asked not be identified, said the United
States would like to talk to the Iranians about ending the Persian
Gulf war, the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon, and
terrorism. But he said the U.S. message did not specify conditions
for a resumption of relations, severed in 1980.
   As he was leaving a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring
participants in the American Legion's Boys Nation program, Reagan
was asked, ``are you ready to talk to Iran about the hostages. Is
it time?''
   ``If they're willing and ready to talk, it's time,'' he replied.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``there's really
nothing new'' on the fate of the Americans held captive in Lebanon
by pro-Iranian extremists.
   But Fitzwater reiterated that in the wake of Iran's acceptance
of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in
the protracted Iran-Iraq war, American officials have been hopeful
that a dialogue could be established with the government of
revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   On Sunday, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said improved
U.S.-Iranian relations could lead to the release of the nine
Americans, including The AP's Middle East correspondent, Terry
Anderson, who has been held since March 16, 1985, longer than any
other American.
   ``We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into a
dialogue with Iran,'' Carlucci said. ``All they have to do is
designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and
we'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, about
terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever is
appropriate.''
   Asked about speculation the U.S. hostages might be released if
the war ends, Carlucci said, ``We're obviously not going to discuss
any quid pro quo, but if the Irnians want to talk to us about the
hostage situation and how they're going to go about influencing
their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about it. I'm not
in the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for the
hostages. That is contrary to our policy,''
   Fitzwater took the same stand in answering reporters' questions
Monday.
   ``Our position remains the same, that we're always available to
talk any time any place about the safety or the release of the
hostages but we will not negotiate for them and we don't anticipate
any negotiations,'' he said.
   ``We won't negotiate. We won't pay ransom. We won't talk quid
pro quos. We won't give or take,'' he said. ``The answer to release
of the hostages is to release them. ... It's not a complex matter.
... They took them off the streets. They can put them back on the
streets.''
   Reagan has persistently denied that his approval of the
clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985 and 1986 amounted to
an arms-for-hostages deal. But a presidential commission headed by
former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, concluded there was such a
linkage, and so did Congress.
   Two hostages, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and David Jacobsen, were
released during the time of the transfers of U.S. arms to Iran,
which led to the subsequent diversion of sales proceeds to
Nicaraguan rebels and _ eventually _ the Reagan administration's
worst scandal.

   Palestinians clashed with Israeli troops in the
occupied territories Monday, and three Arabs and five Israeli
soldiers were hurt, hospital officials and military spokesmen said.
   The clashes came as the army released 148 Palestinian prisoners
from a desert detention camp in a goodwill gesture for a key Moslem
holiday.
   Most of Monday's violence focused on the seaside Gaza Strip.
   In the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, residents stoned an army
patrol, seriously injuring one officer who suffered a cracked
skull, an army spokesman said.
   In response, troops fired tear gas and live ammunition, wounding
a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old boy, both in the legs, Arab
hospital officials said. The army confirmed one shooting and said
it was checking reports of the second.
   More than a dozen Shati residents were treated for beating
injuries or tear gas inhalation, doctors at Gaza City's Shifa
Hospital said. They said troops surrounded the hospital, apparently
to search for protesters.
   In the Jabliya refugee camp, a frequent site of violence on the
outskirts of Gaza City, Arab stone-throwers forced an army jeep to
veer out of control and turn over, injuring four military police,
an army spokesman said.
   The spokesman said the driver lost control of his vehicle after
a rock injured his hand.
   Two of the injured policemen were taken to a hospital and two
were treated at the scene, the spokesman said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity in keeping with military regulations.
   The army immediately clamped a curfew on Jabaliya, forcing the
camp's 60,000 residents to stay indoors.
   In the central West Bank village of Deir Ammar, residents hurled
stones and bottles at an army patrol. Troops opened fire, wounding
a protester, the army said.
   Doctors at nearby Ramallah Hospital said the 22-year-old man was
shot in the abdomen.
   The freed Palestinian prisoners were taken in five buses from
the Ketziot detention camp in the southern Negev Desert to military
headquarters in Gaza City, where they were welcomed by hundreds of
friends and relatives.
   When some of the prisoners went home to the nearby Shati refugee
camp, they were greeted by Arabs shouting pro-PLO slogans, and the
army fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, witnesses said.
   Some of the detainees had been jailed without trial, and the
rest had served short sentences on charges of anti-Israeli violence
during the 7{-month uprising.
   Since the rebellion began in December, 233 Palestinians and four
Israelis have died.
   The prisoner release came on the second day of the four-day
Moslem holiday Eid al-Adha, or ``Feast of Sacrifice.'' The holiday
marks what is described in the Koran, Islam's holy book, as God's
request to Abraham to sacrifice his son, Ismail.
   The army says 6,400 Palestinians are currently being held by
Israel, among them 2,500 jailed for up to six months without trial.
   The army said Monday it has computerized its prison records to
deal with the dramatic increase in the number of Palestinians
detained since the uprising.
   Lawyers have complained they spend weeks tracking down clients
because of sloppy army records and indifferent officials. The
English-language daily Jerusalem Post quoted army officials as
saying information on prisoners can now be obtained within two days.
   But Felicia Langer, an Israeli lawyer who represents Palestinian
prisoners, said problems persisted. She said prison officials often
did not notify her about the whereabouts of her clients.
   Curfews remained in effect Monday in Beit Jalla, where 10,000
Palestinians live, nearby Beit Sahur, home to 12,000, and Nablus,
the West Bank's largest city with 120,000 residents.
   Armed supporters of American-born anti-Arab Rabbi Meir Kahane,
meanwhile, began car patrols of Arab east Jerusalem looking for
stone-throwers. The group, calling itself ``The Committee For Safe
Roads,'' already patrols the area around the West Bank city of
Hebron.
   The leftist Peace Now group called on the Police Ministry to ban
the civilian patrols. But Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev said as
long as the Kahane backers carried licensed weapons and broke no
laws, they could not be stopped.

   An express train from Italy crashed
head-on into a standing freight train Monday and eight people were

   The Milan-Geneva express was traveling at more than 63 mph when
it rammed the other train in the station of this southwestern Swiss
town at 6:30 p.m., railway official Jean Dessous-L'Eglise said at
regional railway headquarters in Lausanne.
   All passengers were quickly evacuated from the coaches, a Swiss

   Local police said eight passengers were injured, none of them
seriously.
   Most damage was to the two locomotives, but both engineers
escaped unhurt, Dessous-L'Eglise said.
   Officials suspected the accident was caused by a switching
error. The railways launched an investigation.

   Sales of existing homes rose in June to the
highest level in a year and a half as buyers tried to beat out
rising mortgage interest rates, a real estate trade group reported
Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.78
million units last month, a 5.3 percent increase over May.
   It was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the highest
level since homes sold at a rate of 4.06 million units in December
1986.
   In May, sales rose a revised 2.0 percent to a rate of 3.59
million units. An earlier estimate had put the gain at 3.1 percent.
   ``The anticipation of continued rising interest rates convinced
homebuyers to get into the market now, rather than waiting,'' said
John A. Tuccillo, the trade group's chief economist.
   ``But, in fact, rates did not increase as much as anticipated,
creating an added incentive for homebuyers,'' he said.
   Rates for fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 10.46 percent
last week, up only about a half of a percentage point from recent
lows in March, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
The average does not include add-on fees known as points.
   However, many analysts are predicting rates will edge up by
another half or full percentage point by the end of the year,
curtailing sales.
   ``I would not be suprised if July gave us a level perhaps as
strong as June, but I think over the remainder of the year, we're
going to see those mortgage interest rates move upward and we're
going to see housing market activity trailing off as a result,''
said Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America.
   June sales were 5.6 percent higher than a year ago, the first
time in 12 months that the sales pace beat the previous year's mark.
   For the first six months, existing homes sold at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units, up from 3.41 million in
the last half of 1987.
   There were 3.53 million homes sold for all of last year, down
slightly from 3.56 million in 1986, which was the best since 1979.
Most economists are expecting sales of about 3.40 million this year.
   ``There's been a clear tapering off, but we aren't in the
doldrums. We haven't had a housing bust by any means,'' said Mark
Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   The strong sales came amid other indications of weakness in the
housing market. The annual rate of construction of new
single-family homes during the first half of 1988 was down 6.4
percent from the July-December rate of last year.
   Peach said much of the demand for new housing that built up when
interest rates soared early in the 1980s has been satisified. He
said existing homes sales are still relatively high in part because
of strong job growth and people moving to accept new and better
jobs.
   The June sales increase was led by a rise of 9.2 percent in the
South to 1.43 million units, followed by gains of 8.7 percent in
the Midwest to 1.00 million units and 7.8 percent in the West to
690,000 units.
   Sales declined 2.8 percent in the Northeast to an annual sales
pace of 700,000 units.
   The median price of an existing home rose $1,800 from May to
June, climbing to $90,600, up 2.0 percent. The median price was up
5.5 percent from $85,900 a year ago.
   Of the four regions, the West had the highest appreciation rate
over the past year, with a median sales price of $125,100, up 9.1
percent from June 1987. The Midwest posted a 7.3 percent gain to
$70,600, while in the Northeast the price rose 5.9 percent to
$146,300. In the South, home prices increased 4.3 percent in a year
to $84,100.

<HEAD>Legislator: Officials Preventing Ethiopian Jews From Emigrating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Israel has denied visas to 150 Jews stranded in
Ethiopia, claiming they are not Jewish by Orthodox law, a
legislator said Monday.
   Mattityahu Peled, a retired general in the Israeli army and a
member of the left-wing Progressive Movement for Peace, said the
Ethiopians have relatives in Israel and have waited several months
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for visas to the Jewish state.
   He said U.S. Jewish leaders apparently assured the Ethiopians
the visas would be issued. The Ethiopians then abandoned their
homes and most of their belongings to assemble in Addis Ababa.
   But ultra-Orthodox Jewish officials at Israel's Interior
Ministry decided against issuing the visas, saying the Ethiopians
are not Jewish, Peled told The Associated Press.
   ``People are suffering because their families are divided,''
Peled said. ``Those who are mixed up in this have no way back. We
can't just leave them hanging in the air.''
   About 7,500 Ethiopian Jews were flown to Israel four years ago
in a secret rescue operation code-named ``Operation Moses,'' and
about 10,000 Jews remain in that African country, according to
official estimates.
   Immigration and Absorption Minister Yaacov Tsur denounced
Peled's remarks Monday as a ``blood libel.'' Israeli officials
consistently refuse to discuss emigration from Ethiopia, fearing
publicity could harm the effort.
   Peled said his information came from the San Francisco office of
the U.S.-based American Jewish Congress, an organization that has
been active in trying to help Ethiopian Jews emigrate. Part of the
information he received was published here by the respected daily
Haaretz.
   David Clayman, a spokesman for the American Jewish Congress in
Jerusalem, quoted AJC President Robert K. Lifton in New York as
saying the organization's head office was unaware of the matter
raised by Peled.
   But an official source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed Peled's story.
   Tsur sent Clayman a telegram protesting the report, saying it
``shamed Israel's name,'' ministry spokesman Gad Ben-Ari said.
   ``I checked this matter with all the authorities involved and I
was assured unequivocally that there is no truth to this report,''
the telegram said.
   Many of the estimated 16,000 Ethiopian Jews in Israel have faced
discrimination from Israeli rabbis who often do not recognize them
as Jewish, claiming they cannot document their descendancy from the
ancient faith.
   The Ethiopians claim they are descendants of the biblical King
Solomon and the Queen of Sheba who lived in the 10th century B.C.
   Peled said many of the Jews left in Ethiopia could be brought to
Israel if not for Interior Ministry officials, who belong to the
ultra-Orthodox party Shas and have sole jurisdiction over visas.
   Ethiopia is allied with Israel's Arab enemies and thus reluctant
to permit Jews to come here.

<HEAD>Feds Indict 22 In Marijuana Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-two people were charged Monday with running
the biggest Asian-based marijuana ring ever uncovered, an operation
that shipped tons of the contraband at a time, federal authorities
said.
   The alleged leader of the ring was British citizen Dennis Howard
Marks, 42, previously acquitted of drug charges in England after
claiming he worked for British counterintelligence, said interim
U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   Marks, a London resident, operated all over the world,
authorities said. ``He was the Marco Polo of drug trafficking,''
said Thomas Cash, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
office in Miami.
   Marks, his wife Judith, and British citizen Geoffrey Kenion were
arrested Monday in Spain on charges contained in an indictment
which accuses all 22 defendants of racketeering, said Lehtinen.
   For 17 years the group shipped marijuana from Thailand and
hashish from Pakistan, and operated in England, West Germany, the
Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the
United States and other nations, he said.
   ``They shipped in ton quantities, thousands of tons,'' said
Lehtinen. The group even bought its own ship, and amassed $30
million worth of property that the government wants confiscated.
   The traffickers allegedly laundered money through banks and
corporations around the world.
   ``It's the largest enterprise ever uncovered involving Asia,''
said William Norris, chief of the organized crime division of the
U.S. attorney's office.
   Police agencies from many of the countries involved, including
England's Scotland Yard, participated in the investigation.
   Patrick Alexander Lane, a British citizen arrested Monday in
Miami, is Marks' brother-in-law. ``Marks made a family enterprise
out of it, using his wife, his brother-in-law and sister-in-law,''
said Cash.
   Lehtinen said he expected Spain to quickly extradite the Marks,
Kenion and William Roger Reaves, who was arrested several weeks ago
in that country on a provisional U.S. warrant.
   ``Unlike some other nations, we expect no problems bringing
these defendants from Spain, which has cooperated fully in this
investigation,'' Lehtinen said.
   More defendants were being sought in the case and more arrests
were expected, including some in the United States, Lehtinen said.

   An F-16 fighter jet on a training
mission from Shaw Air Force Base crashed Monday in the Atlantic
about 50 miles off the South Carolina coast, military officials
said.
   The pilot, who ejected safely, was plucked from the water by a
Marine rescue helicopter about 40 minutes after the 10:15 a.m.
crash, said Dave McMahon, a spokesman at Shaw, which is located in
Sumter.
   The pilot, identified as Capt. Paul Stone, 32, of Paintsville,
Ky., was examined at the hospital at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base
and released, said Staff Sgt. Brad Kadrich.
   The one-seat, $10.7 million F-16 was on a combat training
exercise with a second plane. The second aircraft made the initial
radio report to authorities, McMahon said.
   The cause of the accident may not be known for weeks, McMahon
said.
   Stone is assigned to the 19th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Shaw.

   Monsoon rains and lighting killed 116
people in the past two weeks, including 33 members of one family,
and destroyed thousands of homes, a government official said Monday.
   More than a foot of rain caused flooding that inundated 7,000
homes in the eastern province of Punjab, according to Mohammad
Arshad, flood relief commissioner.
   He said 1,000 villages along the Jhelum and Chinab rivers in
northern Kashmir province were flooded and more than 100,000 acres
of land are under water, with cotton and rice crops the hardest hit.
   Lightning started a fire that killed 36 people, 33 of them from
the same family, and consumed eight homes in northeastern Pakistan,
according to Pakistani television.
   The storms also were blamed for one of the worst bus accidents
in Pakistan this year. A bus was swept into a shallow ravine
Thursday about 21 miles southeast of Islamabad, killing 70 people,
police said.
   Witnesses said panicked passengers jumped into the water and
drowned.

Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of big-city police chiefs and
criminologists said Monday that Congress and President Reagan are
throwing money at anti-drug programs whose effectiveness never has
been tested.
   The coalition, in a letter sent to members of Congress and the
White House, urged that money be earmarked for research and
development in the war on drugs to find out which programs are most
effective.
   ``We are calling on the federal government to do what it is not
doing now ... to include money for research ... and bring
reflection and thought to our policy on drugs,'' Anthony V. Bouza,
chief of police in Minneapolis, said at a news conference where the
letter was released.
   The coalition said 5 percent of total federal anti-drug funds
should be set aside for research and development. Congress is
expected to approve at least $1 billion for the war against drugs
in the next fiscal year.
   Research could help determine how best to reduce demand for
drugs, which treatment programs are most effective in keeping drug
addicts from committing crimes and determine the costs and benefits
of massive police crackdowns on drug-dealing locations, the police
chiefs said in their letter.
   ``Throwing more money into existing programs will not answer
these and other critical questions,'' the group said. ``We urge you
to invest in better strategic knowledge for winning this war.''
   The current war on drugs ``is characterized by defeat,'' Bouza
said because of the lack of a coherent policy. Police need to know
whether massive roundups of suspected drug dealers and raids on
suspected drug operations are effective in deterring drug dealing,
he said.
   The letter was signed by 46 police chiefs, sheriffs, law
enforcement representatives and criminologists.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 26-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 64 in
southeastern Tennessee is the first segment of a new National
Forest Scenic Byways system, the Agriculture Department announced
Monday.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson said the byway is located
in the Cherokee National Forest and passes through scenic areas
dominated by rock bluffs, mountain peaks and Lake Ocoee.
   The biway also offers ready access to white-water rafting,
boating, swimming and historical sites related to the Civil War and
the Cherokee Indian culture, he said.
   The program was begun this summer ``to increase the scenic
enjoyment of the millions of people who drive through national
forests each year,'' Robertson said.
   Despite a variety of more active recreational activities,
driving for pleasure remains the most popular in the nation's 156
national forests located in 43 states, he said.
   Various groups are working with the USDA agency to place
interpretive signs, develop brochures and provide facilities
designed to make a drive through the forests more enjoyable,
Robertson said.
   A spokesman for the agency, Jay Humphreys, said he expected
``probably three or four more'' scenic byways will be designated by
the end of summer. He said nominations are due by Oct. 1.
   The Tennessee byway was the first to be nominated and the first
to be approved, Humphreys said.

   Backers of George Bush and Pat Robertson,
who feuded for months over the Michigan delegation to the
Republican National Convention, agreed Monday to greater
representation for Robertson's supporters in a show of unity that
officials hope will ensure a winning GOP ticket in November.
   The agreement, reached after weeks of negotiations between the
two factions, gives the former Republican presidential candidate 13
of the state's 77 delegate votes at next month's convention.
   Vice President George Bush, the virtual nominee, gets the
remainder of the delegates.
   ``Having this agreement behind us now really clears the deck,''
said state party Chair Spencer Abraham. ``It allows us to continue
on using the time until New Orleans to develop the Michigan
campaign.''
   Lori Packer, the Michigan director of Americans for Robertson,
said the Robertson camp was convinced a credentials fight over
delegates would hamper the party's mission: electing the Republican
ticket in November.
   ``Our differences are minimal compared to what we face in the
fall,'' Ms. Packer said. ``Proving we are right ... at the expense
of having Michael Dukakis as the leader of the free world is a
price that we're not willing to pay.''
   In the early stages of Michigan's two-year delegate-selection
process, the Robertson forces matched the Bush forces in recruiting
precinct delegates to the county conventions.
   That led to a temporary shift of party leadership, a series of
lawsuits and in January a dramatic split at the state convention.
Robertson-backing Republicans _ joined by some supporters of New
York Rep. Jack Kemp _ broke from the main GOP group, held their own
state convention and planned a credentials challenge in New Orleans.
   As part of the agreement announced Monday, the renegade
Rpublicans agreed to put the only remaining lawsuit on hold for
nine months and the national party agreed to give non-voting
``honorary delegate'' status to about 30 of the renegade delegates
who have made transportation and hotel arrangements for the
convention.
   Of the five delegates who relinquished seats, four were from the
Kemp camp and one was a Bush delegate _ former Gov. George Romney.
In addition, two delegates gave up their membership on convention
committees in favor of Robertson backers.
   Bush has amassed more than the 1,139 delegates needed to win the
nomination. But Robertson, who returned to his evangelical
television program since dropping out of the presidential race, has
not released his delegates.
   The 13 Michigan delegates remain bound to vote for Robertson
unless he says otherwise, according to Ms. Packer.
   ``It hasn't been made clear to me what his intentions are,'' she
said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who want to claim a body from the
coroner's office will first have to identify the corpse in a photo
lineup under guidelines established after a woman gained custody of
a body to fake her own death certificate.
   The Los Angeles County coroner now also requires people wishing
to claim a body to show a driver's license and have fingerprints
taken.
   Officials said that while they are sympathetic to grieving
families, the new rules are necessary to prevent a similar scam in
the future.
   The stricter standards came about after a woman trying to avoid
creditors and probation officers gained custody of an unidentified
body and tried to have her name registered as the deceased.
   Sharon Hall and her mother, Helene Tilch, were sentenced July 14
after pleading guilty to one count each of false personation, or
creating a non-existent person.
   Ms. Hall, 35, received a two-year sentence, and Ms. Tilch, who
is 58 and in a wheelchair, got 16 months.
   Ms. Hall used the name Sharon Agee, called the coroner's office
in December and said she was looking for her dead sister. The
investigator asked for a description of the dead woman and Ms. Hall
essentially described herself.
   Her height, hair color and general description _ a heavyset
white woman in her mid-30s _ matched that of an unidentified body
unclaimed since its discovery Oct. 25 alongside a highway. The
woman apparently died of a drug overdose.
   Ms. Hall and her mother were very emotional when shown the body.
   ``They were good at their craft,'' said Philip Spada, a
supervising coroner's investigator. ``And their craft was scamming
people.''
   The coroner's office, which handles 17,000 to 20,000 bodies a
year, released the body to the two women, who had it cremated and
mailed the death certificate to Ms. Hall's probation officers,
prosecutors said.
   Sacramento County probation officer Karen Raquel ordered a copy
of the autopsy report, and the results showed the dead woman had
undergone a hysterectomy and was covered with tattoos. Raquel knew
the two characteristics did not fit Ms. Hall and called police.
   The dead woman's ashes have been returned to the coroner's
office, where they will remain should the woman's real relatives
come forward.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Delay on Use of Device To Protect Turtles From Fish
Nets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Monday voted to delay a National
Marine Fisheries Service requirement that shrimp fishermen use
devices to prevent sea turtles from being snared and drowned in
nets.
   Under an amendment proposed by Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
shrimp boats would not have to use turtle excluder devices in
offshore waters before May 1, 1989, or in inshore waters before May
1, 1990.
   Approved by voice vote, the language represented a compromise
worked out by Heflin and Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, floor
manager of legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Endangered
Species Act.
   The compromise, which also provides for a National Academy of
Sciences study of sea turtle populations and the value of turtle
excluders, allowed the Senate to begin debate on the endangered
species legislation, similar to a House-passed bill.
   Backers of the Endangered Species Act had been trying for more
than three years to get a bill to the Senate floor to renew the
1972 law, which has technically lacked legislative authorization
since Oct. 1, 1985.
   The House version of the reauthorization bill contains a ban on
requiring turtle excluders in inshore waters before May 1990. A
U.S. District Court in Louisiana last April issued a temporary
injunction against the fisheries service requiring use of teh
excluders in offshore waters.
   Conservationists argue that the sea turtle population is being
decimated by shrimp nets. Shrimpers contend that excluder devices
are dangerous to the operation of their vessels, reduce shrimp
catches and are unnecessary for turtle survival.
   Senate leaders gave no indication when they expected to complete
work on the reauthorization bill.

   President Reagan said Monday that some
features of drought-relief legislation violate principles he laid
out for a package of aid to financially troubled farmers.
   In a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate agriculture
committees, Reagan said, ``I am concerned that, due to the
undeniable pressure to produce a bill as quickly as possible, some
provisions were incorporated ... without adequate review.''
   The president did not spell out which provisions of the
bipartisan legislative package were bothering him, although he had
said previously that ``this humanitarian assistance should not be
used as a means to other ends.''
   ``Extraneous matters, such as rewriting the existing farm bill,
will only deter our efforts to provide this much-needed aid,''
Reagan said in the letter to Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and
Richard Lugar, R-Ind. The letter also was sent to Reps. Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas, and Edward Madigan, R-Ill.
   ``We hope that the Congress shares our drought relief objectives
and will continue to work the administration to enact them promptly
into law,'' Reagan said in the letter.
   During a tour of drought-stricken corn and soybean crops in
Southern Illinois earlier this month, Reagan voiced concern that
the relief package might take on the appearance of a ``Christmas
tree,'' in which lawmakers attach favored amendments on legislation
they know will pass the Congress.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that
administration officials expect Congress to resume work on the
legislative package this week.
   He said ``the House is a little ahead of the Senate, but we're
hopeful for good progress this week on the drought legislation.''
   Meanwhile, Reagan got an updated report on the drought from
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, who has returned from a
10-state tour of Midwestern drought areas.
   At the same time, the Agriculture Department named Indiana as
the fifth state to be designated entirely as a drought disaster
area. The designation means eligible farms can apply for emergency
loans from the Farmers Home Administration. Other entire states
already approved are Alabama, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   The White House press office said in a statement that Lyng
presented Reagan with pictures the task force had taken of corn
damage in several states.
   ``Pasture and hay are in very bad condition, causing real
problems for livestock farmers,'' Lyng told Reagan. ``Even the best
corn is not in very good shape. The rains of last week are helping.
But it may be too late for corn to recover.''
   Lyng also told the president that ``some soybeans will recover,
but there still will be large losses.'' The secretary said it
probably would be another month before the government can make hard
estimates of crop losses.

   U.S. Rep. Claudine C. Schneider told the
state Board of Elections on Monday that she signed her 1986
candidacy declaration with the same signature that has jeopardized
her 1988 candidacy.
   Schneider, R-R.I., signed both forms with her middle initial,
which is not on her voter registration card. And that was part of
the trouble.
   Schneider also listed her Narragansett address on the 1988 form
as 56 Central Ave., although, as her registration reflects, she
actually lives on Central Street.
   State law requires the two forms to match exactly, and three
minor candidates asked the board Monday to disqualify Schneider
because of the discrepancies.
   Two other candidates _ Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., and
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bruce G. Sundlun _ have been
challenged on similar grounds. Sundlun's hearing was scheduled
later Monday, and Chafee's for Tuesday.
   Decisions on all three cases were expected Wednesday.
   Schneider and her attorneys contend her 1988 candidacy can't be
challenged because her 1986 candidacy went uncontested despite the
signature discrepancy.
   ``As I was about to put my signature on there, I asked my staff,
`How did I sign in 1986?' and they said, `Claudine C. Schneider',''
she said.
   The 1986 form listed her address as Central Street, and the
congresswoman said she did not know how that error was made.
   ``The best I can guess is I had a staff member fill out the
form. Evidently, it's a typographical error,'' Schneider said.
   Mary Beck, clerk of the Narragansett Board of Canvassers,
testified the board refused to certify Schneider's candidacy
because the law does not allow discrepancies.
   But Beck said there was never any question of fraud.
   Earlier this year, the town and state board disqualified Denise
R. Felice, a would-be Jesse Jackson delegate, from the presidential
primary for the same middle-initial error Schneider made.
   ``What was good for Felice should be good for Mr. Chafee and
good for Claudine Schneider,'' argued John J. Staradumsky, one of
those objecting to Schneider's candidacy.
   Schneider's attorneys said the cases were different because
Schneider had relied on the earlier filing, and because the
objections to her candidacy were filed by three people who would
not be affected by the decision rather than by primary opponents.
   Staradumsky is seeking Chafee's seat; Vincent J. DuBreuil is
seeking a state Senate seat, and Stephen Robertson, who filed the
first objection to Schneider's candidacy, is running for her seat
as a write-in candidate.

   President Augusto Pinochet and Chile's
other military chiefs will meet Aug. 30 to choose a presidential
candidate, expected to be Pinochet, whose name will be alone on a
yes-or-no ballot later this year.
   A decree published Monday in the government bulletin said Gen.
Pinochet, who is army commander, and the heads of the air force and
national police last week set the date for their August meeting.
   Choosing the nominee Aug. 30 indicates the referendum will be in
October. Under the 1980 constitution, the vote must occur no less
than 30 days and no more than 60 days after the nominee is chosen.
Pinochet said in a speech July 7 it would take place in ``no more
than 90 days.''
   The 72-year-old general has been president since the coup in
September 1973 that ousted the late President Salvador Allende, an
elected Marxist. Pinochet's fellow commanders are Gen. Fernando
Matthei of the air force, Adm. Jose Merino of the navy and Gen.
Rodolfo Stange, national police commander.
   Their decision on a nominee must be unanimous, the constitution
says, and if they cannot agree within 48 hours, the nomination will
be made by majority decision of an eight-member National Security
Council.
   If a majority of voters ratifies the choice, the candidate
chosen will begin an eight-year presidential term in March. If not,
an open election will be held in 1990, when congressional elections
are planned.
   Opposition politicians expressed no objections Monday to a vote
in October.
   Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist, told journalists the opposition had
expected the referendum to be held Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary
of the coup, and a later date provided more time to campaign
against it.
   Lagos is co-leader of a coalition working for rejection of the
military candidate. It plans to make its own count of the vote with
20,000 volunteers serving as monitors at polling stations.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the Christian Democratic Party,
the country's largest, said announcing the nomination date so far
in advance ``is good news,'' but he and Luis Maira of the Christian
Left Party said the government must take other steps to ensure a
fair vote.
   A specific step they mentioned was lifting the state of
emergency that allows the government to limit political activity
and press freedom.
   This will be the first vote for president since Allende won the
office in 1970. More than 6 million of the 8 million eligible
voters have registered to participate.

   Police raided the homes of the
Rev. Frank Chikane and his mother before dawn Monday in a failed
attempt to find and arrest Chikane's 18-year-old brother, the
family and authorities said.
   Chikane, secretary-general of the South African Council of
Churches, to which most Protestant denominations belong, said
police entered his home in the black township of Soweto at about 3
a.m. looking for his brother, Khotso.
   The minister, an outspoken critic of the white-led government,
said police later raided his mother's home nearby and detained
Chikane's sister, Salome, in connection with a book and a poster
allegedly found in the house.
   Police confirmed the searches, saying they released Salome
Chikane after questioning. They said they could not find Khotso
Chikane, but have long sought to arrest him under
state-of-emergency regulations.
   The younger Chikane is president of the Soweto Students Congress
and was detained for three months shortly after the national
emergency was declared in June 1986. Police have been hunting him
for about a year, Frank Chikane said.
   Mrs. Chikane's house was raided last week and two days later a
hand grenade was found in her mailbox.
   ``I am deeply concerned that instead of investigating and
finding the culprits who planted the hand grenade ... the police
are harassing my family,'' Chikane said.
   ``Today, I felt once more that we are a people without a
government, no police or army to protect us or secure our safety,''
he added.
   Police said the searches were conducted under state-of-emergency
regulations that give authorities sweeping powers. An estimated
30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths of time
without charge under the emergency.
   Emergency regulations also restrict reporting about unrest,
security force action, treatment of detainees, most forms of
protest and a wide range of statements the government considers
subversive.
   Apartheid establishes by law and custom a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   City officials cleaned out and sealed Monday
the first two of 500 houses identified by police as crack dens, and
neighbors plagued by drug traffic gave mixed reviews.
   ``I'm glad to see this happen because they would come to my
house by mistake,'' Lavinia Murray said from the front porch of her
southwest Philadelphia home, watching city workers haul junk out of
a neighboring house and begin sealing it.
   Another neighbor, Yvonne Hill, was not so impressed.
   ``They'll just move around the corner, or down the street.
They're everywhere,'' she said.
   A day before, Mayor W. Wilson Goode toured what police said was
a crack house in the neighborhood as he announced a campaign to
drive drug dealers out.
   ``We're going to harass them so much, arrest them so many times
that we'll drive them out of the neighborhoods and out of the
city,'' said Goode, whose announcement followed growing
drug-related violence in which children have been shot.
   Once houses have been identified as places where drug sales take
place and raided by police, Goode said the houses would be sealed
or demolished.
   Goode said southwest Philadelphia has about 150 of the estimated
500 to 600 houses in the city where the crack form of cocaine is
sold.
   Employees of the city Department of Licenses and Inspections
showed up Monday with dump trucks to clean out and shut down two of
the houses, taking out furniture and everything else inside and
tearing out gardens.
   ``What we're trying to do is close a couple of houses, to
stabilize the neighborhood,'' said L&I Commissioner John Plonski.
   ``Our department has made a determination that these houses are
not beyond repair and that they can be salvaged,'' he said.
   Neighbors said no drugs had been sold from either house for the
past three months. No one was in either house, and no arrests were
made.
   ``They (drug dealers) stopped (dealing) before this,'' said Joel
Walker, 25, sitting on the steps of his home a couple of doors
away. ``Them people ain't dumb. Doing houses ain't going to stop
it. It's a big street. If they lose them (houses), they're going to
get another.''
   Deborah Robinson, 31, a mother of two from the same block, said
the city's action would help ``a little.''
   ``It's a beginning, but still more has to be done,'' she said,
adding dealers had begun conducting business on a nearby corner.

   An endangered Florida panther, believed
to be one of only five surviving at Everglades National Park,
underwent surgery Monday to fix its mangled leg, state wildlife
experts said.
   ``She was hit by a vehicle. She lost a lot of blood,'' said
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission Lt. Jim Hoffstodt. The
60-pound female was spotted limping by a passer-by who called
officials Saturday.
   ``They found panther blood and hair and started to track the
cat,'' Hoffstodt said. They had her tranquilized and shipped her to
Gainesville on Sunday.
   Surgeons at the University of Florida's veterinary school
implanted a steel plate in the cat's left hind leg to stabilize its
broken thigh bone. The plate was to be anchored by grafted bone
from the panther's left front shoulder.
   An estimated 30 to 50 Florida panthers, shy and nocturnal brown
cats, remain in the state. The injured female is one of five in the
Everglades park that have been tagged with radio collars.
   ``That radio collar saved the panther's life. We never could
have found her if she wasn't wearing it,'' Roelke said.
   If the operation is a success, the panther will spend several
months recuperating.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reorganized her
Cabinet on Monday, dividing the unwieldy Health and Social Services
Department and choosing a new health secretary from the left of her
Conservative Party.
   The new post went to Kenneth Clarke, 48, who has been trade and
industry minister, said an announcement from Mrs. Thatcher's office
at 10 Downing St. Her Cabinet now has 22 members.
   Clarke is one of a half-dozen politicians regarded as possible
successors to the 62-year-old prime minister. He will oversee the
National Health Service, whose uncertain future is among the most
sensitive issues of Mrs. Thatcher's third term.
   Tony Newton, a 50-year-old former deputy health minister, was
brought into the Cabinet to take Clarke's former job.
   In what was widely seen as a demotion, Mrs. Thatcher took
responsibility for the National Health Service away from John
Moore, the social services secretary. She also removed him from a
committee that is reviewing the future of the National Health and
is to report in September.
   Mrs. Thatcher changed 21 of about 90 ministerial posts outside
the Cabinet, dropping six officials. The most senior Cabinet posts,
foreign affairs and finance, were left in the hands of Sir Geoffrey
Howe and Nigel Lawson, ending speculation that Lawson might quit
because of policy differences with Mrs. Thatcher.
   Among the non-Cabinet changes, Foreign Office minister David
Mellor, a vocal critic of Israel, was moved to a job of equivalent
rank in the Health Department.
   Mellor, one of Howe's five deputies, was succeeded by William
Waldegrave, a minister in the Environment Department.
   The first shuffle of Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet since she won a
third term in the June 1987 elections had not been expected until
September. Aides said she acted early because of the impending
report on the National Health, which was established 40 years ago
to provide Britons with cradle-to-grave care.
   National Health costs $35.4 billion a year and Social Services,
including welfare and state pensions, add another $83.4 billion.
The total is 44 percent of government spending.
   Clarke, whose views are generally more liberal than Mrs.
Thatcher's, was elected to Parliament for Rushcliffe, central
England, in 1970 and appointed to the Cabinet in 1985.
   As trade and industry minister he shared a portfolio with Lord
Young, the trade secretary and a member of the unelected House of
Lords. Clarke also was minister for inner cities, whose revival
Mrs. Thatcher considers a major task.
   He is a Cambridge-educated writer who describes himself as ``one
of the classless meritocracy of the 60s.'' Like Mrs. Thatcher, a
grocer's daughter, he is the son of a small-town shopkeeper.

   Cincinnati Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk
underwent a four-hour brain operation Monday to seal off a ruptured
blood vessel that could have killed him if it had not been treated,
his chief surgeon said.
   Dr. John M. Tew Jr., a pioneer in laser surgery who conducted
the operation, said Pilarczyk could leave the hospital after a week
and return to work in four to six weeks.
   Pilarczyk, 53, was listed in good condition.
   Pilarczyk, Roman Catholic archbishop since 1982 in the
550,000-member Archdiocese of Cincinnati, suffered the aneurysm
near the base of his brain Saturday while vacationing in
Gatlinburg, Tenn. He was transported to the University of Tennessee
Hospital in Knoxville for initial treatment, then was moved by
helicopter Sunday to Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, a
Catholic hospital.
   Pilarczyk survived because his hemorrhaging stopped after the
rupture and because of good treatment he received at the Tennessee
hospital, Tew told a news conference Monday.
   ``I really felt today like I was being guided. I never saw an
operation go so smoothly,'' said Tew, chairman of neurosurgery at
Good Samaritan.
   Tew said the medical team cut into Pilarczyk's skull and used
two 5-millimeter stainless steel clips to seal off the aneurysm, a
sac formed when a weakened blood vessel wall bulges. That should
prevent another rupture, Tew said.
   Doctors have bypassed the artery and rerouted the brain's blood
supply to another artery.
   Pilarczyk has an excellent prognosis and shows no signs of
paralysis or other damage, Tew said.
   ``There is no damage to the brain itself,'' Tew said. ``He
doesn't seem to have any trouble at all right now.''
   Tew said the aneurysm is the result of a congenital weakness in
the wall of the artery, which gets thinner over time. About 40,000
Americans suffer blood vessel ruptures each year and approximately
15,000 of them die as a result.
   Auxiliary Bishop James Garland is running the archdiocese in
Pilarczyk's absence.

   A man with nine drunken driving
convictions was sentenced to the maximum term Monday for causing a
head-on collision in which a woman was killed four months before
she was to be married.
   Norman Routhier, 44, of Tyngsboro, Mass., pleaded guilty to
negligent homicide in the March 1987 death of Sandra Sant, 24, of
Dunstable, Mass.
   Prosecutor Robert Walsh asked for and got the maximum sentence _
3{ to seven years in prison _ arguing that Routhier had ``a total
disregard for the safety of others'' and ``nothing else would keep
Norman Routhier off the road.''
   Superior Court Judge Linda Dalianis also gave Routhier a
consecutive 12-month sentence for a lesser offense, but credit for
time served already and for good behavior while in jail essentially
wipes it out.
   Walsh's sentencing memorandum said Routhier had been drinking at
the Moose Lodge in Nashua starting at 11:30 a.m. on March 10 and
was ``shut off'' by the bartender at 5 p.m. when he was visibly
drunk, singing and dancing.
   Routhier repeatedly refused offers for a ride home, Walsh wrote,
and drove down a highway where he hit two cars before colliding
head-on with Sant's car.
   Sant died in the hospital the next day.
   Authorities said Routhier's blood-alcohol level was 0.29
percent, nearly three times the legal standard for drunkenness in
New Hampshire.
   At the time, Routhier had six drunken-driving convictions in New
Hampshire, one pending that later was dismissed, and three
convictions in Massachusetts, according to officials in the two
states. He had lost his driving privileges in New Hampshire for
five years in 1985, but had a Massachusetts license.
   Routhier said nothing at the sentencing hearing except that he
understood the sentence.
   ``He'd rather be dead,'' said his lawyer, Brian O'Connor. ``He'd
rather have died that night than take the life of Sandra Sant.''
   Sant and Kevin Olds of Tyngsboro, Mass., were to have been
married in July 1987.
   ``Sandy was buried in her beautiful wedding dress that she was
so excited about and the flowers that should have attended her
wedding lined her coffin,'' her weeping mother, Nadine Chadwick of
Logan, Utah, testified before the sentencing.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci on Monday
outlined modest changes in Pentagon contracting procedures designed
to curb the types of abuses uncovered in the ongoing defense
procurement investigation.
   The new practices place strict limits on what the Pentagon calls
``Best and Final Offers'' that each company can make on specifc
contracts, Carlucci told a news conference.
   In the past, contractors have been able to amend their final
offers in consultation with the Pentagon to change prices or
technical specifications to meet Defense Department needs.
   Many of the alleged abuses disclosed in the current procurement
investigation involved contractors who, through improper activities
by consultants, learned the price or other specifics of bids by
competing companies, and used that information to submit a new
``Best and Final Offer'' tailored to win contracts worth billions
of dollars.
   ``It is the Best and Final Offer that seems to us to create the
most intensive point in the competitive cycle,'' Carlucci said.
``And that means that information is at a premium.''
   ``We intend to continue with our competitive process. But when
you repeat it once, twice or three times, then it can readily
become subject to abuse,'' Carlucci said.
   Neither Carlucci nor his aides were able to say how frequently
companies were allowed to make more than than one Best and Final
Offer, although he said it was ``the exception'' rather than the
rule.
   He said he envisioned further actions as more information is
disclosed from the Justice Department investigation into
allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed
Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be vital in
winning lucrative contracts.
   Carlucci, who was due to testify before the House Armed Services
Committee on Tuesday about steps he has taken to control
contracting abuses, previously had announced many of the steps that
he outlined Monday. Among those he mentioned Monday, the Pentagon
has:
   _Required that 17 companies implicated by the investigation to
certify they did not engage in ``illegal or improper activity'' to
obtain a defense contract.
   _Require those 17 to agree, in any new contract greater than
$100,000, to include a clause allowing the government recover
profits or 10 percent of the contract value if the deal is tainted.
   _Started procedures to lift the security clearances of six
people, including one suspended without pay from the Navy
Department and five others transferred to other duties pending
results of the investigation.
   _Drawn up a protocol for the armed services to follow when new
information is disclosed from the investigation.
   _Sent letters to the top 200 defense contractors urging them to
implement strong internal ethics programs, ``stringent management
controls, and asking them to report back to us on their
self-governance programs.''
   _Review Federal Acquisition Regulations to tighten controls on
consultants employed by defense contractors.
   _Formed an audit task force to review the cost imposed on the
military budget by consultants employed by private defense
contractors.
   Carlucci said the certification requirement was being applied
only to the 17 implicated companies to avoid imposing unneeded
costs on contractors that were not under suspicion.
   ``This is a rifle action. It is not a shotgun action. We are
directing this at certain contractors. We do not intend to apply it
indiscriminately, because it does impose a burden on people,'' he
said.
   ``And where there are burdens, there are costs, and those costs
may come back to the Pentagon and the U.S. taxpayer,'' he said.
``It is only where we have reason to believe that people are under
suspicion that we are doing this.''
   ``We are going with a pre-award certification for certain
contractors, basically those contractors whose premises have been
searched,'' he said.
   Carlucci declined to identify people whose security clearances
were being lifted, saying only that ``we are taking steps to revoke
the security clearances of individuals who have been involved in
illegal or improper actions.''
   In a related development, the White House announced that
President Reagan intends to nominate Milton L. Lohr to the new
position of deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition.
   Since 1983, Lohr has been president of the Defense Research
Corp. in La Jolla, Calif. Before that, he was executive vice
president of Flight Systems Inc. from 1969 to 1983.
   Lohr, a 63-year-old native of Revere, Mass., graduated from the
University of Southern California in 1949 and the University of
California, Los Angeles, in 1964.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
Monday the Soviet legislature should oversee the defense industry
and make decisions about how the armed forces are used abroad.
   His remarks to a Kremlin foreign policy conference, reported by
state television, were an elaboration of proposals Soviet officials
have mentioned for expanding the powers of the legislature, the
Supreme Soviet.
   Shevardnadze said last month's Communist Party conference set
the stage for strengthening civilian control of the military.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the conference of 5,000
party members June 28 ``an effective constitutionally authorized
mechanism'' was needed for a ``businesslike and competent
discussion of international issues.''
   New legislative procedures would bring ``all departments
occupied with the military and military-industrial activity ...
under the control of the highest all-people's elected organ,'' said
a television announcer who paraphrased Shevardnadze's remarks. The
reference appeared to be to the Supreme Soviet.
   Supreme control over the military now is believed in the hands
of the Defense Council, which works in secret without revealing its
exact functions or membership. Official media have said Gorbachev
leads the council.
   Gorbachev proposed in his speech to the party conference that a
new, stronger president take over the Defense Council and make key
foreign policy decisions.
   Conference delegates supported his call for strengthening the
legislature by creating a 2,250-member Congress of People's
Deputies that would choose a smaller standing Supreme Soviet.
   Shevardnadze said the new legislature should supervise ``use of
military forces outside national borders of the country and plans
for defense construction and openness of military budgets,''
according to the television report.
   Bringing the legislature into decision-making on foreign
military activities may be an attempt to avoid repetition of what
some Soviet officials say was the mistake of sending troops into
Afghanistan in December 1979.
   They say only a few Soviet leaders approved the intervention and
did so without consulting specialists who would have advised
against it. The soldiers now are being withdrawn under an agreement
mediated by the United Nations.
   A Western military attache told The Associated Press the changes
Shevardnadze outlined reflect an effort to ``have more people have
a say'' in military decisions.
   Shevardnadze's remarks were reported only partially in the
television news program Vremya. A report of the foreign policy
meeting by the Tass news agency did not include Shevardanadze's
proposals for wider oversight of the military.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III attacked two
of his former top aides Monday, saying they triggered an
independent counsel's 14-month criminal investigation of him by
failing to conduct a ``competent and thorough'' inquiry in the
spring of 1987.
   Meese told the National Press Club that if Deputy Attorney
General Arnold Burns and criminal division chief William Weld had
done their jobs correctly, there probably would have been no basis
for independent counsel James McKay to investigate Meese.
   McKay recently concluded that Meese ``probably'' broke criminal
laws on four occasions, but the independent counsel did not seek an
indictment. Meese has since announced he will resign, probably by
mid-August, and has pronounced himself ``completely vindicated.''
   Weld and Burns said they would have no immediate comment on
Meese's attack. Both are scheduled to testify before Congress on
Tuesday.
   Meese said the decision to launch a criminal investigation of
him was based on ``hearsay'' from executives of the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. and who had pleaded guilty to felony charges. He said
that neither he nor ``to the best of my knowledge'' his longtime
friend, E. Robert Wallach, who is under indictment for alleged
racketeering in the Wedtech scandal, was interviewed during the
inquiries overseen by Burns and Weld.
   Burns and Weld abruptly resigned four months ago to protest
Meese's continued tenure as attorney general in the face of McKay's
investigation. Burns and Weld are scheduled to testify about their
resignations Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Meese declared that ``the evidence now shows that if a competent
and thorough preliminary investigation had been directed by the
then-deputy attorney general and the former head of the criminal
division, there would likely have been no cause for referral to an
independent counsel.'' The attorney general did not refer to Burns
and Weld by name.
   In the spring of 1987, Burns and Weld oversaw initial inquiries
by the Justice Department's public integrity section into Meese's
involvement with Wedtech. That resulted in an application to a
federal court by Burns, with Weld's concurrence, for McKay to
launch a full-scale criminal investigation of Meese on May 11,
1987. At the time, Meese asked for the probe as well.
   Federal law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say the integrity section found sufficient evidence to
warrant further investigation of Meese for possible violations of a
law barring acceptance of gratuities. They also said further
investigation was merited on whether Meese aided and abetted a
possible violation of the conflict-of-interest law by former White
House aide-turned-Wedtech lobbyist Lyn Nofziger.
   Had investigators spoken to him or to Wallach, ``the hearsay''
from ``some criminals in New York ... would have been exposed for
what it is'' and ``there would have been no need to even refer this
to the independent counsel,'' said Meese.
   After Meese's speech, Justice Department spokesman Patrick
Korten acknowledged that an FBI agent had interviewed Meese in
April 1987, but said that was in response to the Wedtech probe
being conducted in New York by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, not
in connection with the internal Justice Department review of
Meese's activities.
   According to the sources, Wallach, who is under indictment for
alleged racketeering in the Wedtech scandal, also had been
questioned extensively in the Giuliani probe.
   Meese also questioned the motives of Burns and Weld for
resigning. Burns told President Reagan after quitting that Meese's
legal problems had caused a ``malaise'' in Justice Department
morale.
   Meese disputed suggestions of low morale, saying ``whether the
sources of these falsehoods are the claims of partisan politicians
on Capitol Hill or the self-serving statements of a few individuals
who left the department for their own purposes, an objective look
will reveal that such characterizations could not be farther from
the truth.''
   Meese also said that in regard to McKay's investigation, ``never
before has any independent counsel proceeding resulted in such a
series of leaks'' to the news media.
   ``To be the subject of a relentless series of articles, based on
leaks, which often turned out to be false or misleading, and to be
severely restricted in my ability to respond, generates a feeling
of helplessness and frustration that is almost beyond
description,'' said Meese.

   More than a year after it began, the
court-martial of the first member of the military to face
prosecution on AIDS-related charges moves to its trial phase
Tuesday.
   Pvt. Adrian G. Morris Jr., 28, of Caseyville, Ill., is accused
of having threatened the health of three soldiers by failing to use
condoms during sexual relations and by failing to warn them he had
tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus.
   Morris has pleaded innocent to three counts of aggravated
assault, three counts of conduct bringing discredit upon the Army
and one count of sodomy. He has chosen to stand trial at Fort
Huachuca in southern Arizona before a sole military judge, rather
than in front of a jury panel.
   Morris could be sentenced to up to 17 years in prison,
dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances if
convicted.
   He allegedly had sexual relations with one male and two female
soldiers. One of the women, his fiancee at the time, Spec. 4
Patricia C. Pruitt, gave birth last year to a child allegedly
fathered by Morris.
   A hearing had been scheduled Monday on one remaining pretrial
motion, but the judge, Col. Raymond D. Cole, decided instead to
hold that hearing Tuesday before the trial starts. That motion
involves a prosecution effort to have Cole reverse himself on a
ruling in May that would require one of Morris' alleged victims,
known only as Jane Doe, to identify herself publicly when she
testifies.
   ``She's requested anonymity and we feel a certain obligation to
do everything we can to protect her,'' Col. Harry Beans, staff
judge advocate at Fort Huachuca, said Monday. ``She came forward
and we feel uncomfortable about the prospects of having to reveal
her identity publicly since we don't feel it will add anything to
the case.''
   Court-martial proceedings began more than a year ago but were
adjourned indefinitely Aug. 5 to allow appeal of a ruling that
prohibited the Army from using Morris' AIDS blood test results.
   According to the Army's charges, Morris was routinely tested for
AIDS in April 1986 after he reported to duty as a clerk at Fort
Huachuca, and was told that the results were positive for exposure
to the HIV virus.
   A midlevel military appellate court reversed Cole last fall, and
in March the United States Court of Military Appeals, the highest
military court, let that ruling stand.
   This spring, Morris was demoted from private first class,
reportedly for use of marijuana, although officials have refused to
disclose the reason for the demotion.
   Also in the spring, sources said, Morris offered through his
lawyers to accept an administrative severance from the Army with a
general discharge under honorable conditions. The Army refused.
   Since court-martial proceedings began against Morris, several
other military members have been charged, have entered pleas or
have been convicted of AIDS-related charges.
   They include a soldier at Fort Hood, Texas, who pleaded guilty
to charges including disobeying an officer; another at Fort Sill,
Okla., who pleaded guilty to aggravated assault; an airman at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, who was convicted of
aggravated assault; and a Navy officer acquitted of assault and
adultery in a San Francisco case.
   The Army and Air Force have instituted regulations ordering
commanding officers to inform any soldier or airman testing
positive for exposure to the AIDS virus that failure to inform all
sex partners of the test results and to practice safe sex will
bring discharge or prosecution.
   The Navy instituted a similar legal advisory policy, but it
apparently does not require commanding officers to issue a warning,
according to a spokesman.

   The only one of five enlisted Navy
instructors charged with involuntary manslaughter in the training
death of a 19-year-old recruit pleaded innocent Monday.
   A military judge also set an Aug. 29 trial date in the
court-martial of Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, but said he
may delay it if a defense lawyer could not appear because of his
wife's illness.
   If the date stands, Combe's trial would start a week after that
of Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, officer in charge of the Navy Rescue
Swimmer School at Pensacola Naval Air Station when Lee Mirecki, of
Appleton, Wis., died March 2.
   Four other enlisted instructors were charged only with
conspiracy to commit battery and received nonjudicial punishments
including reductions in rank and loss of pay.
   Torchia also was offered nonjudicial punishment but chose a
court-martial in an effort to clear himself. Combe, however,
received no choice. His court-martial was ordered by Vice Adm. N.R.
Thunman, chief of naval education an training, following an
investigative hearing last month.
   The Navy has accused Combe of holding Mirecki's head under water
after he was pushed into the pool. Besides manslaughter, Combe is
charged with battery and conspiracy to commit battery.
   Instructors allegedly forced Mirecki into a pool after he had
panicked, climbed out, held on to an equipment rack and shouted
that he was quitting the course.
   At the investigative hearing, a pathologist testified that
Mirecki had a phobia about being dragged under water, which
triggered heart failure followed by drowning. Mirecki was taking
part in a practice rescue in which the instructors, playing the
role of panicked air crash victims, grasped recruits in a head-hold.
   Witnesses at the hearing gave conflicting testimony on whether
Mirecki was in Combe's grasp or had extricated himself from the
instructor's head-hold when he collapsed.
   The military judge, Cmdr. Gregory K. Radlinski, denied a request
by defense lawyers to delay the trial until late September.
Prosecutor Lt. David G. Smith had argued for starting the trial as
early as Monday.

   The nation's hen flock worked a little harder
last month, but because of fewer birds the extra effort fell short
of the year-ago production mark, the Agriculture Department
reported Monday.
   June output was estimated at 5.52 billion eggs, down 2 percent
from June 1987, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board
said. Meanwhile, the number of hens in laying flocks declined 3
percent during the month to an average of 269 million birds.
   Individually, however, the fewer hens shelled out more eggs _ an
average of 2,054 eggs per 100 birds during June, up from 2,033 a
year earlier, the report said.

<TEXT>
   Bitter words circulated in the scientific
community Monday over reports that this week's edition of a
respected science journal will debunk an experiment that defies
scientific theory.
   The experiment baffled researchers because it appeared to use
sound methods to prove the impossible: that natural proteins called
antibodies that react with certain blood cells will continue to
react when diluted far beyond the point where they should
theoretically be able to do so.
   Nature, a science weekly, published the antibody findings in its
June 30 edition, but in an unusual ``editorial reservation''
declared: ``There is no physical basis for such an activity.''
   It said experts it later chose to review the research did not
believe the result, but could not fault the conduct of the
experiments, and the journal promised to have independent
investigators observe repetitions of the experiments.
   The report of the investigation is to appear in this week's
edition of Nature and advance word, leaked to the French press, is
that it dismisses the experiment as fanciful, poorly conducted and
of no scientific value.
   Editors of Nature have refused comment, but sources at the
magazine confirmed privately that an article will appear that
discredits the experiment.
   They also confirmed reports that Nature's independent
investigators were James Randi, a professional magician from
Florida known for studying unusual scientific claims, and Walter
Stewart of the National Institutes of Health at Bethesda, Md., an
investigator of scientific fraud.
   ``Nature is going to produce a totally and completely negative
report on the experiment,'' said Dr. Jacques Benveniste of the
French medical institute INSERM, who produced the inexplicable
results at his Paris laboratory.
   Researchers in Canada, Israel and Italy say they have duplicated
Benveniste's results. Benveniste and the sources at Nature magazine
both said the report does not suggest cheating was involved.
   Benveniste said in a telephone interview he had seen Nature's
article and ``I don't consider it as serious. I think it will harm
Nature.''
   Randi and Stewart ``made an enormous amount of mistakes that I
will outline in my answer to Nature,'' Benveniste said, adding that
the controls the investigators used were inadequate. Controls are
special samples used in laboratories to check testing procedures.
   Quoting from the rebuttal he is sending to Nature, Beneviste
said: ``All in all, the judgment is based on one dilution series,
tested on two bloods, in awful technical and psychological
conditions. Outrageous.''
   He would not specify what Nature's article says because the
magazine has not yet released it publicly, but quoted a passage he
said would ``make their whole report auto-destruct.''
   As quoted by Beneviste, the passage says: ``Thus we believe that
many of the experiments whose results are regarded as significant
are artifacts of statistical noise. But plainly this doesn't apply
to all the data _ for example the fourth experiment in the series.''
   That means the investigators had failed to discredit all the
experiments, he said.
   Patricia Fortner, an immunology research associate at the
University of Toronto, which reported duplicating the experiment,
said last month: ``It's unbelievable and it breaks all rules.''
   She said in an interview at the time that the supposedly
impossible reaction occurs even at extreme levels of dilution when
theoretically no antibody molecules are left in the solution.
   ``This has really shaken up our world,'' she said. ``Even people
who have seen this phenomenon find it hard to believe.''

   Guerrillas attacked and set
fire to a bowling alley in the capital Monday in response to the
police disruption of an anti-government march, the establishment's
manager said.
   No one was reported hurt. No group made independent claims of
responsibility for the attack.
   Guillermo Castro, manager of the Bolerama Jardin, said 10 to 12
masked men with pistols and at least one submachine gun burst into
the bowling alley and identified themselves as ``urban commandos''
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   The front, a coalition of five guerrilla groups, has waged an
8-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government, but the fighting
in recent years has been largely restricted to the countryside.
   Castro said the guerrillas made the about 30 patrons ``lie face
down on the floor and took from them money they said was a
`contribution' to the cause. They said the attack was in reprisal
for the government's repression of Thursday's march.''
   The guerrillas then doused several pool tables in a room
adjoining the main bowling area with gasoline and set them afire,
and the flames spread, Castro said.
   Firefighters arrived within 15 minutes and extinguished the
blaze. Castro estimated damage at $20,000.
   Castro said none of the bowling alley owners has any connection
with the government, and that he did not understand why the
establishment was selected as a target.
   Last Thursday, police used tear gas and fired shots in the air
to break up an anti-government demonstration in San Salvador.
Protesters then burned at least nine vehicles.
   Human rights groups estimate more than 65,000 people have been
killed in El Salvador since the civil war began in October 1979.

   Arson investigators returned to Steven
Spielberg's gutted beachfront home Monday to examine the blackened
second floor for clues on what started the fire that also heavily
damaged director Walter Hill's home.
   Damage to both homes from the Sunday night fire along the Broad
Beach celebrity enclave was placed at more than $330,000. While the
fire is believed to be accidental, the arson team went Monday for a
second look.
   ``The arson investigators have determined the fire at the home
of Steven Spielberg was accidental in nature,'' said Deputy Kathryn
Nielsen of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ``They were
out there late last night, but decided to go out again today to see
if they could find out how it started.''
   Spielberg; his actress-wife, Amy Irving; and their son, Max,
weren't in the house and there were no injuries, authorities said.
Hill also wasn't home, but arrived as firefighters were mopping up.
   One investigator said film stored at Spielberg's house may have
been a factor.
   Damage to the Spielberg home was estimated at $210,000, Reyna
said. Hill's residence next door sustained $120,000 in damage, with
about 30 percent of the home destroyed.
   It took 40 firefighters about 40 minutes to extinguish the
blaze, which broke out about 6:40 p.m.
   Other celebrity residents along the mile-long section of Broad
Beach Road include Sylvester Stallone, Robert Redford, Carroll
O'Connor and Goldie Hawn. The Broad Beach homes range between $3
million and $10 million in value.
   The fire, which could be seen for miles along Pacific Coast
Highway, attracted hundreds of onlookers and sheriff's deputies had
to be called to clear a path for emergency vehicles, authorities
said. Malibu is about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   Among Spielberg's hit films as producer or director are
``Jaws,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark,'' ``E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Empire of the
Sun,'' ``The Color Purple'' and the recently released ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit.''
   Hill produced and directed ``Red Heat,'' the current hit
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jim Belushi. His directing
credits include ``48 Hrs.,'' ``The Warriors,'' and ``Extreme
Prejudice,'' and he co-produced the popular science fiction
thrillers ``Alien'' and ``Aliens.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Cheered at Office, But Faces Federal Funding Delay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis was greeted by cheering Massachusetts state
employees Monday when he returned to the governor's office for the
first time since winning the Democratic presidential nomination.
But a Republican complaint was likely to force him to wait for $46
million in federal campaign funds.
   ``This will probably add some time to the deliberative
process,'' Sharon Snyder, a Federal Election Commission spokeswoman
said of a GOP request that federal money be held up until the FEC
can rule on questions raised by Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's pursuit
of the vice presidency and re-election to the Senate at the same
time.
   Vice President George Bush, like Dukakis, was off the campaign
trail after winding up a trip Sunday night. Bush was polishing a
speech in which he planned to call for tougher ethical standards
for government officials and members of Congress.
   As for Bentsen's races, Jann Olsten, executive director of the
Republican Senate Campaign committee, said Monday, ``There is no
question that one is going to impact the other.''
   ``A dollar spent by Sen. Bentsen in Texas, whether for the
Senate or the vice presidential campaign, is going to directly and
immediately benefit both,'' said Olsten. ``It just isn't fair.''
   An unusual Texas law permits Bentsen to run for vice president
at the same time he is on the ballot for re-election to the Senate.
   Bentsen's latest campaign report showed him with $3.9 million on
hand for his Senate race against GOP challenger Beau Boulter.
   While there is no lid on how much he can spend on his Senate
campaign, federal law limits direct expenditures in the
presidential campaign to the federal campaign funds _ divided
equally between the major party candidates.
   Dukkais campaign spokesman Leslie Dach shrugged off the possible
delay in receipt of the $46 million.
   ``Our campaign is moving full steam ahead with plenty of
momentum from the convention,'' he said.
   One sign of the kind of momentum cheering the Dukakis campaign
was a new poll taken in Texas by Peter Hart Research Associates.
   The survey of 502 likely voters on Friday and Saturday, the two
days immediately following the Democratic Convention, said Dukakis
was favored by 50 percent and Bush by 40 percent. The survey had a
margin of error of 4 percent.
   A pre-convention survey in Texas by Hart had the two candidates
tied at 46 percent each.
   Bush was spending the week in Washington, attending to official
duties.
   He will deliver a speech Tuesday at the Library of Congress on
ethics in government, prescribing ``high standards'' to prevent
conflict of interest by federal officials, including members of
Congress. Aides say Bush wants a strengthened office of ethics in
the White House.
   The speech, long in the making, was delayed until the release of
the report by independent counsel James M. McKay on Attorney
General Edwin Meese, which said Meese probably broke two tax laws
and twice violated a criminal conflict-of-interest statute. McKay
sought no charges.
   Bush says the Justice Department, in particular, must be above
even the appearance of wrongdoing. ``I would have to reluctantly
conclude _ reluctantly because I like Meese _ that those standards
were not met,'' Bush told reporters last Saturday.
   When Dukakis appeared at the Massachusetts Statehouse shortly
before 9 a.m., about 20 state employees greeted him with applause.
   Once in his office, Dukakis took up where he left off before the
convention and became immersed in efforts to defuse legislative
protests over his use of a line-item veto to bring the state budget
into balance.
   Some legislators were calling for a special session to try to
override some of his vetoes of $138 million in appropriations.
   Meanwhile, at the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that it is likely President Reagan will veto plant-closing
legislation that Dukakis has been making an issue in the
presidential campaign.
   ``It's always open until it's done,'' said the spokesman when
asked if there were a chance Reagan would change his position on
the legislation that would require companies to give employees and
communities 60 days notice before shutting down a plant.

   In a July 5 story about a motion to reduce
the prison sentences of brothers Barry and Ronald Semler, The
Associated Press erroneously reported that the men were convicted
of illegally selling helicopters to North Korea.
   The Semlers initially were charged with 27 counts of export
violations, including illegal sale of helicopters to North Korea.
But in a plea-bargaining agreement, the Semlers pleaded guilty to
reduced charges. The charge relating to alleged illegal helicopter
sales was dropped.
   In addition, the article erroneously said a federal judge denied
the motion to reduce the Semlers' prison sentences.
   In fact, the judge postponed his decision until after the Summer
Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. If there are no serious
incidents at the Games, he said, he will consider reducing the
sentences in exchange for community service involving establishment
of a camp for underprivileged children at Ronald Semler's Malibu
ranch.
   The Associated Press also reported the judge said he would
``never let these guys out'' of prison if serious incidents
occurred at the Olympics. In fact, the judge said he would not let
them out early ``on my own prerogative.'' The judge does not have
authority in this case to extend the prison terms.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Says Pakistan, U.S. `Fan Flames Of War'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan lodged a strongly worded
protest with the U.N. Monday, accusing Pakistan and the United
States of violating peace accords and pleading with the U.N.
secretary-general to end this ``license to kill.''
   Afghanistan charged the two nations with fanning ``the flames of
war'' and engaging in ``blind terrorism.''
   A U.N.-sponsored political agreement was signed April 14 in
Geneva, providing for Soviet troop withdrawal over nine months,
non-interference in Afghan affairs and return of Afghan refugees
who have fled the civil war.
   The accords were signed by Afghanistan and by Pakistan, which
acted as spokesman for the anti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas, and were
guaranteed by the United States and the Soviet Union. The
guerrillas did not sign the accords.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil of Afghanistan cited in his letter
to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``the new wave of
ferocious and adventurist actions by extremists linked with the
Peshawar-based alliance of seven (guerrilla groups) who have
created appalling tragedies with missile barrages on Kabul and
other cities.''
   Major Afghan anti-government guerrillas are based in Peshawar,
Pakistan. Kabul is the Afghan capital.
   Wakil urged the U.N. chief to end the purported violations of
the Afghan accords by Pakistan and the United States, which has
been aiding the guerrillas.
   ``The people of Afghanistan expect that the means of
interference and the shipment of weapons will stop and the license
to kill shall no more be issued,'' said the letter, the latest in a
series of U.N. protests by Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.
   ``Is it not high time for Pakistan, principal signatory of the
accords, and the United States of America, the state guarantor,
which still fan the flames of war, to understand the futility of
blind terrorism?'' Wakil's letter said.
   His letter complained that on July 15, 17, 19 and 20, Kabul
residents were killed in bomb blasts by guerrillas based in
Pakistan. In the past 1{ months, it said, 177 missiles were fired
into Kabul, killing 75 people and injuring 98.
   The letter said the guerrillas want to disrupt the government
policy of reconciliation, create panic among the civilian
population, frighten refugees from returning to Afghanistan and
jeopardize the future of peace.
   It said Afghanistan is carrying out the Geneva accords and
Soviet troops are withdrawing on schedule, ``but brazen violations
are being carried out by the other side.''
   The United States has been supplying the guerrillas with an
estimated $500 million annually in arms and military supplies
channeled through Pakistan. It vowed to continue the supplies as
long as Moscow keeps up its military support of the Afghan
government.
   The Afghan accords prohibit Pakistan's interference in
Afghanistan's affairs. But weapons supply from the Soviet Union is
not banned. A separate agreement signed by Moscow and Washington
allows them to continue supplying their respective sides.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan at the end of 1979 to prop up
the pro-Soviet government and stayed on to help fight the
guerrillas. The estimated 115,000 Soviet troops began withdrawing
May 15 and are to complete the pullout by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Researcher: Tiny Genetic Defect Could Explain Origin Of Many
Diseases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Microscopic defects in the body's
energy-generating system have been shown to cause blindness and
might also cause major diseases of the heart, brain, liver and
kidneys, a researcher said Monday.
   Douglas C. Wallace of the Emory University Medical School in
Atlanta said his research is the first to link a specific disease
to defects in tiny chemical factories called mitochondria, which
convert food into energy to support living cells.
   Wallace has for years been pursuing the notion that defects in
mitochondrial genes could be important in many human diseases, and
now he says he has proved his case.
   In a research paper that has been submitted to a journal for
publication, Wallace said he demonstrates a link between a precise,
pinpoint mitochondrial defect and a rare inherited disease known as
LHON, which can lead to blindness.
   ``I feel now statistically this is the right answer,'' Wallace
said at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, where he is helping
to teach a course in genetics.
   Dr. Berkeley Powell, associate professor at the Oregon Health
Sciences University in Portland, who is familiar with Wallace's
research, said, ``I think it is an important step, but people have
been suspecting this for a long time _ so I don't think it's
revolutionary.
   ``The work is certainly very good and demonstrates it (the link)
very nicely,'' Powell said.
   The disease called Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, or LHON,
is very rare, Wallace said. But he has also linked mitochondrial
defects to several other rare genetic diseases, and he is convinced
that these defects will be shown to be the cause of some major
degenerative diseases for which the cause has not yet been found.
   Mitochondria are tiny structures inside cells that convert
carbohydrates into energy-carrying molecules that can be dispatched
around the cell to keep its machinery running _ and keep it alive.
   Each mitochondrion has a tiny set of 13 known genes that are
entirely separate from the genes and chromosomes that carry most
hereditary information, and that are responsible for most
hereditary diseases.
   The mitochondrial genes are passed on to offspring only by
mothers, through their eggs. Sperm carry only a few mitochondria,
and those mitochondria are not incorporated into the developing
offspring.
   Furthermore, they reproduce and mutate rapidly, compared with
other genes, and thus the diseases they cause can appear and
disappear in individuals and in succeeding generations, Wallace
said. That's why it was so difficult to prove that they were
causing disease.
   Wallace said that cyanide is known to poison people by damaging
their mitochondrial genes. Cyanide causes disorders of the brain,
heart, liver, kidneys and muscle, he said.
   It may therefore be possible that genetic defects in the
mitochondria can also cause such disorders, he said.
   In particular, he mentioned cardiomyopathy, a gradual weakening
of the heart muscle for which there is no cure, except for a heart
transplant. Its cause is unknown.
   Because mitochondria reproduce and mutate rapidly, it is
possible that defects that appear during an individual's lifetime
can trigger this harmful degeneration in the heart, he said.
   Wallace emphasized that with the exception of the few rare
disorders to which he has linked the mitochondria, his ideas about
the role of mitochondria in disease are speculation.

<HEAD>Senate Thwarts Two Helms Attempt To Restrict Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Monday thwarted two attempts by
Sen. Jesse Helms to eliminate or restrict the federal family
planning program, denounced by the North Carolina Republican as
evidence of the government ``going out of control.''
   The Senate voted 65-21 to kill a Helms amendment that would have
deleted the $140 million Title X family planning program from a
spending bill for the departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education.
   The chamber voted 54-34 to kill another Helms amendment that
would have barred all spending by HHS unless the secretary required
by Jan. 31 that unmarried dependent minors 17 or under have written
parental consent to get contraceptives or prescriptions for
contraceptives from federally funded clinics.
   The Senate also approved by voice vote a ``conscience clause''
saying none of the money in the bill can be used to require any
person or entity to perform or facilitate abortions. The provision
applies to medical personnel or denominational hospitals with
religious or moral objections to abortion.
   The amendments arose during consideration of the $137 billion
appropriations bill for the three departments. The money is for
fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   Title X provides money to states, local health departments and
private groups for family planning clinics serving primarily
low-income women.
   Helms alleged that Planned Parenthood, a major recipient of
Title X money, is using federal funds for abortion-related services
and that in the last 10 years, Title X money has been used for
``secret sex programs for our nation's teen-agers.''
   ``The federal government takes money from American parents and
then uses that money to give contraceptives ... to their
children,'' Helms said. ``This is wrong. This is immoral. This is
evidence of the federal government going out of control and moving
far beyond what our founding fathers had in mind.''
   ``Title X is not an abortion program. It's a knowledge
program,,'' rejoined Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn. ``I wish it were
that all teen-agers would go to their parents for advice in this
area. But the fact is they don't... There are those situations
where there is no home. Then who does the job?''
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said lawmakers like himself who oppose
abortion should not handicap family planning clinics in any way.
``We'd be taking a step backwards, in the wrong direction,'' by
requiring parental consent, he said. ``We would have more and more
unwanted and unplanned babies...''
   Exon and Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the Labor-HHS
appropriations subcommittee, urged senators to vote their
convictions on the Helms amendments and not cave in to political
pressure.
   ``We all know in our heart of hearts how we ought to stand on
it,'' Chiles said of the parental consent amendment. ``It's a
question of how we are recorded on it... Are you going to trigger
some group against you or not?''
   The abortion amendment was sponsored by Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., who said so-called conscience clauses currently are written
into some laws but not others.
   ``Absent this amendment, persons involved with programs (in this
bill) might or might not be protected in the exercise of their
conscience in this matter,'' Humphrey said. ``In some cases they
would... In other cases they would not.''

<HEAD>Saudi King Looks To `Amicable' Way Of Ending Rift With Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Fahd said Monday that he
regretted the absence of Iranians at the annual Moslem pilgrimage
to Mecca and expressed hope of an amicable settlement of the rift
between his country and Iran.
   Fahd, speaking to leaders of Moslem delegations in a speech
broadcast on Saudi radio, said: ``I regret not having seen the
pilgrims of the Iranian nation participating with their Moslem
brothers at these sacred spots.''
   The Saudi king said Iranian pilgrims still were welcomed to
``the land of Islam'' and blamed Iran for decisions that led to
their absence this year.
   ``What we hope is that these matters be settled in an amicable
manner and that the Moslems be gathered together in one frame,'' he
added.
   Saudi official figures released Monday said 1,379,556 Moslems _
including 762,755 from abroad and 616,801 from within the kingdom _
gathered this year for the pilgrimage, or hajj, which culminated
Sunday with the start of the four-day Eid al-Adha or Feast of
Sacrifice.
   About 145,000 pilgrims from Iran went to Mecca for the 1987 hajj.
   Iranian pilgrims held demonstrations last year in Mecca, despite
a ban on political protests, and 402 people died, including 275
Iranians. Saudi Arabia said they died in a stampede, but Iran
accused Saudi police of shooting at the pilgrims.
   Citing terrorism and subversion, Saudi Arabia last April broke
diplomatic relations with Iran, which has advocated taking away
from the Saudi royal family custodianship of Mecca and Medina,
Islam's holiest sites.
   Saudi authorities earlier announced that the number of pilgrims
would be restricted this year to one for every 1,000 residents of
each Moslem country.
   Iran boycotted the hajj to protest the cuts, and its
government-controlled news media said demonstrations occurred again
this year. The Saudis have denied those reports.
   Fahd made no reference to the Iranian reports of protests and
referred only indirectly to the 1987 riots.
   What happened last year, he said, was ``over ... and thanks be
to God, wisdom and logic prevailed and matters were put in their
perspective,'' he said.
   All of the world's 850 million Moslems are expected to make at
least one pilgrimage to Mecca if they can afford it.
   Mecca is the birthplace of Mohammed, the founder of Islam. Its
Grand Mosque houses the Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine.
   Pilgrims also made journeys this week to shrines in Medina,
Mohammed's base for his 7th Century conquest of Arabia and the
spread of the religion.

   The Kruegers of Michigan, having
paddled their own canoes through Arctic ice and past Amazon
alligators, pushed off Monday on the homestretch of their
21,000-mile journey to the tip of South America.
   Verlen Krueger, 66, and his wife Valerie, 37, began their
``two-continent canoe expedition'' on June 8, 1986, about 200 miles
north of the Arctic Circle and hope to finish in February at Punta
Arenas, Chile.
   ``I've always had this in me, wanting to be an explorer like
Christopher Columbus or Daniel Boone,'' said Verlen Krueger, a
former farmer and plumber who built the two 17-foot canoes in his
garage at Lansing.
   Michigan is paying some expenses of the 2{-year trip as part of
the celebration of its 150th birthday. The Kruegers agreed to
collect rain and river water for research by two chemical
companies, and another company provided freeze-dried food.
   The two have paddled the icy waters of Canada's MacKenzie River
and through the Great Lakes, ridden the currents of the Maumee,
Wabash and Tennessee rivers and coasted down the Tom Bigbee
Waterway into the Gulf of Mexico at Mobile, Ala.
   ``There were no precedents for us at all,'' said Krueger, who
has covered much of the United States on canoe trips.
   He and his wife rigged their two canoes into a catamaran and
paddled 2,300 miles across the Caribbean, island-hopping from the
Bahamas to the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the West Indies.
They entered South America in Venezuela's Orinoco River.
   In the Bahamas, the canoes were surrounded by 3-foot-long
iguanas, fierce-looking but harmless.
   Alligators and howler monkeys abounded in the Amazon. ``We saw
hundreds of alligators,'' Verlen said. ``They have a disconcerting
way of entering the water to get away and it looks like they are
coming right at you.''
   The Kruegers said they do not speak Spanish but managed to get
along by using a dictionary, hand signals and ``smiling a lot.''
   One high navy official in Venezuela issued an order ``that if
anyone should see us, they should take care of us and feed us,''
said Valerie Krueger, a former technical assistant to a geologist.
   ``Our secret is that with a woman and a man with a gray beard,
nobody feels threatened by us,'' she said. As for illnesses, ``We
don't have time to get sick,'' she said, and added: ``The only
thing that really became a problem other than our sanity and legs
was that our soap bars kept falling overboard.''
   During a brief portage in Brazil between the Orinoco and an
Amazon tributary, an army captain was so impressed by the voyage
that he played them a tune on an instrument resembling a ukelele.
   They had to paddle 200 miles upstream on the Paraguay River in
Brazil because high winds had blown water plants into a solid mass
that blocked their path, and later spent 17 days without touching
shore on the same river because of floods.
   From the Arctic Circle to Asuncion they logged more than 17,000
miles, leaving about 4,000 miles to go around Cape Horn to Punta
Arenas. It was sunny, but chilly, on Monday when about 100
well-wishers saw them off.
   Their planned route is down the Paraguay, south on the Parana to
Buenos Aires, then down Argentina's Atlantic Coast to the Straits
of Magellan and around the cape to Punta Arenas.

<HEAD>Peres Supports Conservative Jews In Struggle Against Orthodox</HEAD>

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Conservative
Jews on Monday he feels control of the faith by Orthodox rabbis
would harm Jewish unity.
   In an emotional speech frequently interrupted by applause, Peres
told representatives of the U.S.-based Rabbinical Assembly that his
Labor Party has ``decided to keep Jewish life together as a matter
of principle.''
   ``We have decided profoundly, seriously and permanently not to
discriminate Jewish people within the Jewish life and not to divide
the Jewish people,'' he said.
   The Rabbinical Assembly represents 1,200 Conservative Jewish
leaders worldwide. It began a six-day 88th annual convention Monday.
   Conservatives are struggling against what they contend is
discrimination by Orthodox rabbis, who dominate Israel's state
religious offices.
   More than 100 rabbis demonstrated against alleged discrimination
Sunday outside the seat of the Chief Rabbinate, which is Israel's
highest state religious body and is controlled by Orthodox Jews.
   Peres pledged to defend Conservative Jews against Orthodox
attempts to pass a ``Who's a Jew'' law that would change the status
of the non-Orthodox.
   ``Who is a Jew?,'' Peres asked. ``I can answer it very simply.
There is no Jew who can exclude another Jew from the Jewish life.''
His statements deviated from past Labor Party policy of cultivating
religious parties as political allies.
   Israeli analysts recently suggested Peres has abandoned hope of
forming a coalition with religious parties after parliamentary
elections in November.
   Labor faces a tough campaign against Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, with religious parties leaning
toward Likud.
   Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of
America in New York, recalled a meeting with Peres at which the
foreign minister ``told us with gravity that the elections to come
would be the most important in the 40-year history of Israel.''
   ``Last week, Mr. Peres enlarged the nature of his campaign. He
entered the lions' den,'' Schorsch said, referring to the foreign
minister's criticism of the Orthodox establishment in a speech
Wednesday to 500 Orthodox rabbis from 30 countries.
   ``Mr. Peres raised the issue of religious discrimination within
that assembly,'' Schorsch said. ``By that exercise of courage he
enlarged the campaign to include the issue of pluralism and the
termination of religious terrorism within the state of Israel.''

Disarmed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal paramilitary police fired on
mobs in Gujarat state Monday, an Indian news agency reported, a day
after the state's 59,000 police were ordered disarmed in a union
dispute.
   No reports of casualties were issued.
   Paramilitary forces opened fire in the state capital at
Gandhinagr and in Ahmedabad, the state's largest city, ``to
disperse violent mobs,'' the United News of India news agency
reported.
   Both army and paramilitary troops intervened in Ahmedabad to end
a stone-throwing fight, the Press Trust of India news agency
reported. It did not elaborate.
   In Ahmedabad, 18 miles south of Gandhinagar, the mobs also set
fire to four houses, eight shops and three-owned buses, the news
agencies said.
   The trouble began Sunday, when state officials accused police
unions of fostering a revolt, dismissed 55 policemen for ``high
indiscipline,'' ordered the state's police disarmed and called in
the army and the federal paramilitary troops.
   Police unions called a strike Monday, but the news agencies said
it was only partially successful.
   Paramilitary troops were reported patrolling most towns, and
army troops marched in four cities, the agencies said.
   Police Inspector Ashok Bhatt, a key union leader, has been taken
into custody under the National Security Act, which allows a
suspect to be held for up to two years without trial.
   Bhatt was one of 55 policemen dismissed, and Chief Minister
Amarsinh Chaudhary told UNI Monday that more policemen may be
dismissed in the next few days.
   The police unions have been demanding higher wages and better
working conditions.
   But state officials said Bhatt and his associates encouraged
indiscipline by police, even urging them to refuse temporary duty
in the strife-torn state of Punjab.
   On Sunday, paramilitary troops took control of police armories
in the state and the government ordered four of seven police unions
disbanded, government television reported.

<HEAD>Pakistani Bishop Denounces Debate Over Biblical Miracles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debates over biblical accounts of the
virgin birth of Jesus Christ and his resurrection have done more
damage to the spread of Christianity in the East than have
non-Christians, a Pakistani bishop said Monday.
   ``The theological controversies in the West can strike a fatal
blow to the spread of the Gospel,'' Bashir Jiwan, bishop of
Hyderabad, said. He addressed other Anglican bishops on the ninth
day of the three-week Lambeth Conference.
   Among those in the audience was England's Bishop of Durham David
Jenkins. In 1984, Jenkins aroused controversy by suggesting the
virgin birth, the resurrection and other miracles reported in the
New Testament were symbolic stories and did not actually happen.
   The Lambeth Conference of 525 bishops representing the world's
70 million Anglicans, including members of the Church of England
and U.S. Episcopalians, meets every 10 years.
   Jiwan said ``disbelief in the bodily resurrection of Jesus
Christ and the claim that it was only a spiritual experience of
resurrection in the minds of the disciples raises the question of
the authority of the Bible.
   ``The Bible is the divine source of revelation and the
touchstone of Christian doctrine.''
   He added it appeared Moslems believe more of Christianity than
Western Christian theologians who have ``laid down'' their
spiritual weapons.
   Jiwan and Jenkins were among three speakers discussing
evangelization and culture, but their subjects were not linked.
   Jenkins said Christian churches destroyed the credibility of the
Gospel by competing to recruit new members.
   Evangelization must be wide-ranging, not mutually exclusive, and
confront social, political and economic issues, he said.
   Christians should consider how their social structures,
political policies and ``economic exploitations'' diminished them
in God's image, Jenkins said.
   Bishop David Gitari of Kenya, the first African bishop to
address the full conference, criticized church laws for allowing
tolerance and pastoral care to divorcees while disciplining
polygamists.
   ``We see no contradiction in extending pastoral care to
divorcees, despite Jesus' strictures against divorce,'' he said.
``Yet we maintain a rigid disciplinary stance againmst polygamy
despite Jesus' silence on the subject.''

<HEAD>Prison Escapee Convicted in Sadat Assassination Killed by Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police stormed the hideout Monday of a
former army major who broke prison while serving life for the
assassination of President Anwar Sadat and killed the fugitive in a
gunfight, the government announced.
   It said Essam el-Kemary, 37, died in a shootout with police and
two policemen were wounded but are in satisfactory condition.
   El-Kemary was holed up in a Cairo apartment with two other
prison escapees, according to an Interior Ministry statement. It
said they also were serving life sentences after being convicted of
conspiracy in Sadat's murder.
   A ministry spokesman, who was not identified in line with
regulations, said security forces were searching for the two. He
did not spell out whether they escaped during the raid or were away
from the building when police attacked.
   Police called el-Kemary, a former officer in the armored corps,
``by far the most dangerous'' of the three.
   El-Kemary; Mohammed Khamis, 40, and Ahmed el-Aswani, 31, escaped
from Cairo's maximum-security Tura prison on July 17. They pried
open the cell door with an iron bar, overpowered their guards and
fled in a waiting car.
   They were convicted of conspiracy in the Oct. 6, 1981,
assassination of Sadat, but not of actually firing at him. Sadat
was killed by men in army uniforms while reviewing a military
parade.
   The ministry statement said: ``State securuty inquiries showed
that the escapees used an apartment in Cairo's el-Sharabiya
district as a hideout.
   ``At dawn today, the hideout was attacked. Its occupants met
security forces with bullets and explosive charges, but the forces
succeeded in seizing the apartment. The storming resulted in the
death of fugitive Essam el-Kemary and the wounding of two
policemen.''
   It said police found ``a number of plastic bombs and the prison
uniforms the three men used in their escape.''
   The government has said all three men were members of the Moslem
fundamentalist organization Jihad, or holy war. Jihad was blamed
for Sadat's assassination and an attempted coup.
   In the turmoil following Sadat's murder, Jihad militants took
over some government installations in the southern city of Assiut.
Officials said at the time that 87 people, including 66 policemen,
were killed in gun battles between Jihad members and security
forces.
   After trials, three convicted assassins were executed by firing
squad, two were hanged and more than 120 men were given prison
terms up to life.
   President Hosni Mubarak, who succeeded Sadat, has maintained
emergency laws since the 1981 assassination.
   The laws ban strikes, unauthorized public meetings and
demonstrations, and give the government wide powers of search and
arrest without warrant.

   Morris Busby, President Reagan's
special envoy, met with Honduran officials Monday in preparation
for the visit next week by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Busby met for an hour with President Jose Azcona Hoyo, Foreign
Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras and Defense Minister Col. Wilfredo
Sanchez, but neither the Hondurans nor the U.S. Embassy gave
details of the talks. Also attending the meeting was U.S.
Ambassador Everett Briggs.
   Busby arrived in this capital from Guatemala and left shortly
after midday. His schedule is not being disclosed for security
reasons, but it has been reported he will hold similar meetings
with officials in El Salvador and Costa Rica, but not Nicaragua.
   Shultz is scheduled to meet with the foreign minister of
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica in Guatemala City
on Aug. 1. Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has not been
invited to participate.
   A State Department official in Washington, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said plans call for the foreign ministers to issue a
statement outlining steps needed to achieve peace in Central
America with an endorsement by Shultz.
   The meeting will come as the Reagan administration is
considering a new aid package for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras.
   From Guatemala City, Shultz is to visit Argentina, Uruguay,
Brazil and Bolivia. He then will return to Central America on Aug.
9 for visits to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras for additional
talks on the peace process.
   The five Central American presidents signed a peace plan Aug. 7,
1987 at a meeting in Guatemala. President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last fall for originating the
plan.

<HEAD>Storms Bring Hail, Strong Winds To Parts of Mid-Mississippi Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Intense thunderstorms, which developed ahead of a cold front
pushing through the middle Mississippi Valley, produced heavy rains
and hail Monday in portions of Illinois and Missouri, and strong
storms also were reported in Florida.
   Three hangers and two small airplanes were destroyed and seven
were damaged at the Morgan County Airport in central Missouri. Two
cars and three boats were severely damaged and one airplane was
thrown into a trailer home. No injuries were reported.
   Three-quarter-inch hail fell near Bloomington, Ill., and hail
accumulated 1{ to 2 inches deep near Cooksville, Ill.
   Strong thunderstorm winds felled power lines near Eldon, Mo.,
and hail with winds up to 65 mph were reported near Sedalia, Mo.
   These thunderstorms extended along the cold front into Indiana,
Ohio and lower Michigan, where pea-size hail was reported.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms produced pea-size hail, brief heavy
rains and gusty winds in western Maine and Vermont.
   Strong thunderstorms also hit parts of Florida. A home near St.
Petersburg sustained severe wind damage, the National Weather
Service reported.
   In the South, marble-size hail fell in Marshall County, Miss.,
prompted by thunderstorms extending from southern Arkansas to
western Alabama.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered in the Carolinas,
north-central Texas, central Arizona and along the front range of
the Rocky Mountains.
   Temperatures were in the 70s in the Great Lakes states and the
northern half of New England, and even dipped into the 60s in
portions of the California coast. But much of the nation had
temperatures in the 90s, and in the desert Southwest, temperatures
climbed up to 110.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included nearly 1\ inches at Decatur, Ill., 1.05 inches at Terre
Haute, Ind., and about two-thirds an inch at Springfield, Mo., and
Memphis, Tenn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 60
degrees at Arcata, Calif., and Crescent City, Calif., to 110
degrees at Needles, Calif. The early morning low for the nation was
35 at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Tuesday is for scattered showers and
thunderstorms in the lower Mississippi Valley, the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys and the northern Atlantic coast states. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms also are predicted in Florida, Alabama
and Georgia and in northern Wisconsin, the front range of the
Rockies, western Utah and northern Arizona.
   Highs in the 70s were forecast along the Pacific Coast and
northwestern Washington state, as well as the upper Great Lakes and
northern Maine; in the 80s in the upper and middle Mississippi
valley, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and from the Appalachians to
New England; above 100 degrees in north central Texas, parts of the
Rio Grande Valley, in the desert Southwest and the valleys of
California, and from northeastern Oregon to southwestern Montana;
and in the 90s elsewhere.

<HEAD>New Regulations Adopted For Horse Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New regulations announced Monday by the
Agriculture Department will allow horse shows for all breeds to
continue, said a senator who had monitored the developments.
   ``The negotiations have been long and complex,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky. ``But I think everyone has emerged a winner.''
   Horse shows for many breeds were closed earlier this year after
the American Horse Protection Association filed a lawsuit seeking
enforcement of regulations, primarily for walking horses, that had
adversely affected much of the industry.
   The regulations approved Monday permanently replace interim
rules that had been imposed to allow the continuation of horse
shows while the regulations were being negotiated.
   Major provisions of the new regulations include a new uniform
standard for pads that would apply to all horse breeds; new rules
on pad material; rejection of a proposal by USDA to further limit
the weight of horseshoes; and new guidelines on examination
procedures for horses exhibited in walking horse shows.
   The USDA had solicited comments in April on the interim
regulations. During the last several months, McConnell sponsored
negotiations with major horse organizations addressed by the USDA
interim rules.
   The negotiations resulted in a joint comment on behalf of over
100 national horses organizations being sent to Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng. In the letter, the organizations
recommended the new regulations adopted Monday.
   ``These recommendations were reached after weeks of negotiations
with every major horse organization throughout the country,''
McConnell said in a statement released by his office. ``Now that
the regulations are permanent, horse shows throughout Kentucky and
the nation can continue without the fear of being shut down.''

<HEAD>World's First Test-Tube Baby Celebrates 10th Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louise Joy Brown, the world's first test-tube
baby, celebrated her 10th birthday Monday with her parents and
six-year-old sister Natalie, also conceived through in vitro
fertilization.
   The birthday party was held at the family home in Whitchurch, a
suburb of the seaport of Bristol, according to the Daily Mail
newspaper.
   It quoted Louise's mother, Lesley Brown, as saying: ``One of the
things we were most frightened of when she was born was that she'd
play on the fact that she was the first test-tube baby. But
fortunately she seems pretty stable and level-headed.''
   Louise's father, John Brown, is a truck driver, and the couple
volunteered for in vitro fertilization after they had been unable
to have children during nine years of marriage.
   Professor Robert Edwards, who pioneered in vitro fertilization
with the late gynecologist Patrick Steptoe, said research in the
past decade was making the technique of conception outside the womb
more available and less expensive for childless couples.
   In an interview on British Broadcasting Corp. television,
Edwards said:
   ``The birth of Louise Brown was the first time that science and
medicine had really come into human conception and clarified all
the problems and all the mysteries of human conception.
   ``Now we have a lot of information.... Success rates are going
up with the use of frozen embryos together with better fertility
drugs ... and the cost is going down because newer, simpler
techiques of collecting eggs ... are making the approach far more
simple.''
   Steptoe died earlier this year. He and Edwards, a physiologist,
devised the technique originally to treat women with blocked
Fallopian tubes.
   In vitro fertilization has helped produce thousands of babies
worldwide, but the technique remains costly and uncertain of
success and is available to only about 5 percent of childless
couples.
   ``Most people do not get pregnant (with the technique),''
Edwards said.

<TEXT>
   Police seized 15 tons of hashish in a
specially built tunnel between two Mediterranean resort towns and
made seven arrests, the civil governor's office said Monday.
   The office called it the largest drug haul ever in Spain.
   Among those arrested was Jacques Antoine Cannavaggio, 51, from
Corsica, who was said to be the brain of an international drug
trafficking organization. He was wanted by the French police.
   According to police in Barcelona, Cannavaggio had operated in
southern Italy and France before moving a few years ago to
L'Escala, a village on Spain's northeastern Costa Brava. Police
said a French national, a Portuguese and four Spaniards also were
arrested.
   Police found the 15 tons of hashish Sunday in a tunnel between
the towns of Lloret de Mar and Tossa de Mar on the Costa Brava.
   The tunnel was equipped with a special ventilation system and
police estimated the tunnel cost $1 million to build.
   Police said they also seized a yacht and a motorboat allegedly
used to transport the hashish to Spain from Morocco. Police also
seized six submachine guns.

   Republican National Convention organizers
said Monday it looks as if most of the requests for hotel rooms
during next month's gathering can be met _ although initially, the
demand was far greater than the supply.
   Monday was the deadline for state delegations and other groups
which made their reservations through the GOP to send their
deposits to hotels. By the day's end, it looked as if all those
delegates, staffers and journalists would have a place to call home
during the gathering, which begins Aug. 15.
   ``We've been able to accomodate pretty much everyone,'' said
Mary Mead, a convention spokeswoman.
   Earlier, organizers had been swamped with requests. In fact,
there were about 3,000 more rooms asked for than there were rooms _
and that had organizers nervous.
   But some delegations and news organizations apparently decided
they didn't quite need as much space as they had originally sought.
   ``It's so hard to tell these things until it gets time for the
deposits,'' said Mead. ``Mostly everything has evened out. Groups
adjust their numbers, mostly downward.''
   Monday was a busy day for hoteliers trying to sort out the new
numbers.
   ``We're matching names to deposit checks, making sure the monies
match up with the names,'' said Tom Rosepink, manager of the
Marriott Hotel, where all-but-certain Republican nominee George
Bush and the delegations from Texas, New Hampshire, Connecticut and
Maine will stay.
   He said 1,125 of his hotel's 1,290 rooms are assigned to the
convention through the RNC. Virtually all of the remaining 175
rooms, including a bloc taken by CBS, are for news organizations
and other groups attending the convention, he said.
   The only exceptions are eight rooms rented year-round by Delta
Air Lines. ``And even they are going to drop people off to attend
the convention one day and then continue on their route to L.A.,''
he said.
   Rosepink said he had been asked for more rooms for the vice
president and his entourage, and would give Bush any rooms assigned
to the delegations but not ultimately used by them.
   ``My gut feeling is that there may be one or two rooms
available,'' he said.
   Many hotels couldn't meet the demand without adding a wing or
cleaning out a storeroom. The Hyatt, which will be Media Central,
has booked every one of its 1,193 rooms to the convention.
   The Pallas Suites Hotel, which has 800 of its 1,000 rooms set
aside, may be able to provide 30 to 50 more if renovations are
completed in time, said Joan Caldwell, president and general
manager of Oak Development Corp., which operates the hotel.
   She said the remaining rooms are taken by permanent guests,
tours which made reservations before the GOP decided to come to New
Orleans, and the Secret Service, which booked the rooms on its own
rather than through the convention.
   There are 25,500 hotel rooms in and around New Orleans _ 19,500
within city limits and 6,000 in neighboring Jefferson Parish, said
Bill Langkopp of the Greater New Orleans Hotel-Motel Association.
   ``The Republicans blocked 17,500. Anything else, I'd think,
would be just a normal transient movement. The businessman who
comes here all the time,'' Langkopp said.

   A boat sank after colliding with a barge on the
Yangtze River and 71 people are missing and feared drowned in the
second major boat disaster in Sichuan province in four days, it was
reported Tuesday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the Yunhang No. 24,
carrying a geological prospecting team from the Sichuan Petroleum
Administration, capsized quickly after the collision with the
barge. The crash happened in Yunyang county in southwestern China
on Monday.
   It said 25 people were rescued from the wooden, motor-driven
boat. The accident occurred at 10:42 a.m., Xinhua reported, but it
did not describe weather conditions or give further details.
   Last Thursday, a passenger boat carrying about 250 people sank
after hitting a rock in the Min River, a tributary of the Yangtze,
in Sichuan province.
   There have been differing figures on the number of casualties,
but Xinhua said late Monday 72 bodies have been recovered, about 30
people are missing and presumed drowned, and 152 people had been
rescued.
   An official of the Chongqing Shipping Co. in Sichuan said
earlier that the bodies of eight men 11 women had been found, but
she had little information about the accident because of poor
communications with the remote area.
   She said the company still does not know how many people were on
board when the boat hit a rock in rain-swollen waters and sank. The
vessel was carrying passengers between the towns of Yibin and
Leshan.
   Xinhua said Sunday authorities had located the sunken ship,
which had been carried downstream, and divers had arrived.
   China has been plagued by disasters on its overcrowded
transportation system this year. Four train accidents have left 169
dead, while the crash of a Chinese airliner, also in Sichuan in
January, killed 108.

<HEAD>Politician Apologizes For Remarks About American Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior official of Japan's governing party
apologized Monday for remarks he made that implied that American
blacks do not care if they go bankrupt.
   Michio Watanabe, chief of the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy
Affairs Research Council and considered a possible future prime
minister, said his remarks over the weekend were ``misleading and
inadvertent.''
   In his speech Saturday at the party's annual summer retreat,
Watanabe said:
   ``They (Americans) use credit cards a lot. They have no savings,
so they go bankrupt.
   ``If Japanese go bankrupt, they would think it serious enough to
escape into the night or commit family suicide, but among those
guys over there (in the United States) are a lot of blacks and so
on who would think without concern, `We're bankrupt. Now we don't
have to pay anything back,''' he said.
   On Monday, Watanabe issued a statement apologizing for his
comments.
   ``In speaking of U.S. personal consumption on July 23, I made
misleading and inadvertent remarks, though in no sense did I ever
imply any racial discrimination,'' he said in the statement.
   ``I very much regret that the remarks may have hurt the feelings
of American friends and withdraw those words with apologies,'' he
said.
   Watanabe, a former Cabinet minister who held the finance and
trade portfolios, is a powerful political figure known to aspire to
be Japan's premier.
   In February, he drew fire from China when he said in a campaign
speech that people in China's Shanxi province ``have dug themselves
into pits and are still living there.'' He later apologized for the
statement.
   Watanabe's comments were the latest in a series of controversial
statements by Japanese politicians that have offended foreign
countries.
   Two years ago, former Premier Yasuhiro Nakasone told a Liberal
Democratic Party meeting that the large number of blacks, Puerto
Ricans and Mexicans in the United States brought down America's
intelligence level.
   That comment prompted widespread criticism of Nakasone in the
United States, and he issued an apology.

<TEXT>
   A woman wanted in the 1969 hijacking of an
airliner to Cuba was arrested Monday by FBI agents who said she'd
been living here under an assumed name.
   Linda Joyce Grinage, 39, had been living with her husband as
Haziine Eytina when FBI agents arrested her Monday morning, said
Michael O'Brien, an FBI spokesman.
   Grinage was wanted for the hijacking of an Eastern Airlines DC8
plane en route from New York's Kennedy Airport to Miami on Jan. 2,
1969.
   Authorities said Grinage and her then-husband, Tyrone Ellington
Austin, took a 2-year-old boy hostage on the flight and forced the
pilot at gunpoint to fly everybody on board to Havana.
   No one was injured. The plane carried 138 passengers and a crew
of eight.
   During the alleged hijacking, authorities said, Austin ran up
the aisle of the plane shouting ``Black power!'' and ``Havana!''
Barbara Cottrell, an assistant U.S. attorney, declined comment
Monday when asked if Grinage was involved with any terrorist
organizations.
   Authorities received an anonymous tip last year that Grinage was
in Albany, but held off arresting her until Monday because they
needed more time to firmly establish her identity, Cottrell said.
   The couple remained in Havana when the passengers and crew
returned to the United States, and were indicted on air piracy
charges later that year.
   Austin died in 1971 from wounds he received during a shootout
with New York City police while fleeing a bank robbery. Authorities
did not release information on how the couple re-entered the United
States.
   A hearing to establish Grinage's identity was put off until
Tuesday morning after lawyer Milo Eytina, Grinage's husband,
requested the time to get a more experienced attorney. She was to
be jailed overnight.
   Grinage had no comment to reporters Monday.
   ``She is unable to respond in her present state to questions
addressed to her,'' Eytina told acting U.S. Magistrate Joseph
Scully, describing his wife as ``distraught.''
   If convicted on an air piracy charge, she could be jailed for 20
years to life.
   Grinage has lived in the Albany area since 1983 and has had at
least six different addresses, said Cottrell.
   Speaking to Scully, Eytina said his wife had lived in the
community for 10 years and was gainfully employed. But Cottrell
said Grinage, who has five children, did not have a job outside the
home.
   The FBI has 14 aliases listed for Grinage, according to an
affadavit filed in support of a search warrant. Authorities have
further established her identity through samples of her writing and
telephone records of a phone call made to her grandfather, the Rev.
Walter Staten of Brooklyn.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Girl's Brain Tumor Is Cancerous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brain tumor removed from a 2-year-old
Ukrainian girl is cancerous, and her prognosis is guarded, doctors
said Monday.
   Hanna Andrievna Sverstiuk had the tumor removed from the base of
her brain stem last Friday at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
   ``The outlook for her future is guarded, depending on her
response to therapy,'' said Dr. Roger J. Packer. ``While there's a
high likelihood of the tumor recurring, we're hoping this new form
of treatment can keep her in remission.''
   Hanna's mother, Maria Sverstiuk, has said she believes the
walnut-sized tumor resulted from radiation from the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster, 50 miles from Kiev in the Soviet Union.
   Hanna was born in Kiev five days after the April 26, 1986,
explosion and fire that killed at least 31 people and released a
cloud of radioactive material. She was diagnosed as having a brain
tumor two months ago.
   Doctors, however, say a solid tumor like Hanna's would have
taken 10 to 20 years to develop if it were caused by radiation.
   ``She is recovering extremely well, considering the type of
brain surgery she had,'' Packer said.
   Her mother has maintained a bedside vigil, reading stories and
singing Ukrainian songs, according to the hospital. Hanna is to
begin her radiation program and physical therapy later this week,
the hospital said.
   The toddler's trip to the United States followed efforts of
Ukrainian communities on both sides of the Atlantic and
negotiations between Washington and Moscow.

<HEAD>Body of Missing Girl Found Off Logging Road</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASTORIA, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A body found near this coastal town was
identified Monday as that of a 15-year-old girl whose disappearance
nearly six weeks ago spurred a search of beaches and logging roads
by hundreds of volunteers.
   Authorities used dental records to identify the remains of
Dorene Raterman, said Dr. Larry Lewman, state medical examiner in
Portland.
   Dorene disappeared June 15 after leaving her parents a note
saying she was taking a bicycle ride to Del Ray Beach, a half-mile
from her family's home in Gearhart, on the northern Oregon coast,
about 75 miles west of Portland.
   Within days, state police determined she had been killed at the
beach, and two men were arrested in connection with her death.
   Her body was found Sunday by motorcyclists riding in a brushy
area about 16 miles east of Astoria. An autopy was planned for
Tuesday.
   The girl's disappearance and the arrests angered some of the 970
residents of Gearhart. One of the suspects wore a bulletproof vest
to a court appearance, and a judge held the other's arraignment
secretly because he feared for the suspect's safety.
   Police got their first break in the case when a man reported
seeing a girl on a bicycle and two men in a gold sports car near
the beach the night she disappeared. The description of the car led
them to Tiac K. Eastman, 25, of Astoria, son of a former county
sheriff.
   Eastman admitted he and Anthony Mullins, 25, both dishwashers at
a nearby hotel, had driven to the beach that night in Eastman's car
to drink beer and talk, and saw the girl there, according to a
court affidavit.
   The affidavit said Eastman told police that Mullins strangled
the girl.
   Mullins, who denies Eastman's allegation, was charged with
kidnapping and murdering the girl. Eastman was charged with
hindering prosecution for allegedly driving Mullins from the scene
of the slaying. Both are in jail.

   A judge Monday ordered the San Diego Yacht Club
to accept the challenge of a New Zealand club and settle the battle
for the America's Cup sailing trophy on the seas instead of in the
courts.
   The ruling also cleared the way for the San Diego club to use
its controversial two-hulled catamaran in defense of the title it
reclaimed for the United States in 1987.
   State trial court Justice Carmen B. Ciparick ordered the two
clubs to begin racing Sept. 19 off the coast of San Diego.
   She also denied the request of an English yacht club to join the
race, and rejected the New Zealanders' petition to hold the San
Diego club in contempt of court.
   ``The vision that ... the donors sought to perpetuate over the
years was that of an international race on a grand scale among
boats on the seas, and not a land-bound battle among clever lawyers
in the courthouse,'' Ciparick said.
   The Mercury Bay Boating Club of Auckland, New Zealand, had asked
the San Diego club to accept its challenge sooner than 1991 _ the
next date under the traditional formula of racing every four years.
Mercury Bay also asked to use boats about 90 feet at the water line
instead of the customary 45 feet.
   The judge did not specifically rule on whether San Diego could
use its catamaran, but ordered both sides to proceed with the
competition and bring any complaints to court when the race was
over.
   ``The Cup has always involved sailing challenges between similar
boats, but the judge has ordered us to sail, and we are ready to
sail mismatch or not,'' said Mercury Bay's Peter Debreceny,
Debrency, reached in San Diego. ``If it's a mismatch, it will
destroy the future of the America's Cup.''
   Tom Mitchell, a spokesman for the Sail America group which is
sponsoring the San Diego entry, called the decision a victory for
the American defenders and said his group is ready to race.
   ``Let's get the boats in the water and sail,'' Mitchell said.
   According to the judge, the America's Cup 1887 Deed of Gift,
which established the rules for the sailing competition, is not
specific about many of the changes in yacht racing since the first
America's Cup in 1851.
   The New York Yacht Club held the Cup for more than 125 years
until it lost in 1983 at Newport, R.I., to the Royal Perth Yacht
Club of Australia.
   Stars & Stripes _ the San Diego Yacht Club's entry _ recaptured
it last year when it beat New Zealand in the semifinals then beat
the Austrlian yacht Kookaburra III in Perth, Australia.

<HEAD>PLO Aide Claims Reagan Ally Asked Help in Delaying Release of US
Hostages</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to change preferred spelling of Arafat's first

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign staff
asked the Palestine Liberation Organization to help stall the
release of 52 Americans held hostage by Iran until after the
November election, a PLO official claims. The White House quickly
denied the allegation.
   ``We were told that if the hostages were held, the PLO would be
given recognition ... and the White House door would be open for
us,'' said Bassam Abu Sharif, identified as chief adviser to PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat, in an interview published in the September
issue of Chicago-based Playboy Magazine.
   ``It is not true,'' White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said
Monday in a telephone interview from Washington. Popadiuk declined
to comment further.
   Arafat, who was also interviewed by the magazine, did not
mention the alleged contact with the Reagan staff member, but did
say that the PLO had been instrumental in winning the release of
some hostages.
   ``We released the first hostages from the embassy,'' Arafat
said. ``They were released according to my personal efforts.''
   Arafat said he undertook the mission at the request of Reagan's
predecessor and 1980 campaign opponent, President Jimmy Carter.
   ``There was a special and permanent contact between me and
President Carter,'' Arafat said. ``I have written documents from
President Carter himself.''
   Sharif said he met in Beirut with one of Reagan's ``closest
friends'' during the 1980 presidential race. He identified the
supporter as a major financial contributor to the campaign and a
member of the campaign staff, but did not name the person.
   ``We have the proof if it is denied,'' Sharif told Playboy.
``And I personally assure you that if the Reagan administration
denies what I have said, we will turn this evidence over to you.''
   Sharif said the Reagan associate ``asked that I contact the
chairman and make the request.'' He said he was told ``they would
deny it if it ever became public.''
   Minutes after Reagan's inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, marked the
end of the Carter administration, the 52 Americans who had been
held hostage in Tehran for 444 days were flown to freedom.
   A spokeswoman for former President Jimmy Carter said that he was
not available for comment but that he had been asked previously
about reports that a Reagan supporter had attempted to delay the
hostages' release.
   ``We have reports similar ... but I never sought or received any
confirmation of the allegations,'' spokeswoman Melissa Montgomery
quoted Carter as saying.
   Sharif, who also serves as Arafat's interpreter, made the
assertions during interviews of Arafat, conducted by a Playboy
writer in Tunis, Tunisia and Baghdad, Iraq, in April and May, said
Playboy spokesman Bill Paige.
   Neither Arafat nor Sharif were paid for the interview, Paige
said.
   He said he did not know if Arafat was present when Sharif made
the allegation about a Reagan ally.

<TEXT>
   The nation is finally starting to consecrate a
forgotten war which stirred neither patriotic fervor nor domestic
protest, the brutal, anti-communist crusade in Korea which killed
54,000 Americans and ended with an uneasy armistice 35 years ago
Wednesday.
   World War II veterans returned home triumphantly to ticker-tape
parades. Returning Vietnam veterans often met hostility. Many of
the 1.5 million men and women who served in Korea during the 37
months of fighting simply came home. For years, images of their
sacrifice have been summoned up only during broadcasts of MASH, the
television comedy series.
   ``They went in quietly and went out quietly,'' says one of them,
retired Army Col. John F.C. Kenney Jr. ``They were welcomed back
home with an attitude of indifference. There were no parades, but
there were no put-downs either.''
   Today, only 40 percent of the U.S. public is old enough to
recall the Korean War in Korea today. The United States still maintains
one full division on the demarcation line.''
   But now, perhaps inspired by the belated recognition given
Vietnam veterans, the dead and living from Korea are being honored
with resolutions from Congress and space on the capital's National
Mall for a multimillion-dollar memorial.
   This week, Korea vets are gathered in Washington for a round of
ceremonies which, though mostly low-key, amount to the most
extensive array of commemorative events since the fighting stopped
in 1953, according to Kenney.
   The war began after the Soviet-trained North Korean army crossed
the 38th Parallel into South Korea on June 25, 1950. It ended in
stalemate on July 27, 1953.
   Richard Kolb, writing in a recent edition of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars magazine, points out that the war was not popular
among Americans and was the first in which America essentially
declared the enemy's homeland off-limits to U.S. fighting forces.
   Kolb says that body counts became more important than real
estate as North Korean and Chinese units staged human-wave assaults
that accounted for many of the 1.4 million dead or wounded
communist troops.
   The war _ called a ``conflict'' and ``police action'' by the
Truman administration _ saw the first U.S. use of helicopters to
evacuate wounded, according to Kolb.
   Fighting under a United Nations banner, 54,260 Americans died in
Korea, 33,643 of them in battle. In the nine years of Vietnam,
58,149 Americans died, 47,396 in battle. On a day-to-day basis,
Korea was far bloodier.
   The Pentagon says that 1,269 Americans are still listed as
prisoners of war or missing in action from Vietnam. It has no
specific numbers for GIs still missing from the Korean War, but it
numbers the POWs at 389.
   It wasn't until 1985 that Korea vets even had their own
organization, founded by retired Army 1st Sgt. Bill Norris of Half
Moon, N.Y. The Korean War Veterans Association has grown from 39
charter members to more than 3,000 and is a central participant in
this week's 35th anniversary ceremonies.
   Kenney now is working out of a sparsely furnished office at the
Interior Department as executive director of the Korean War
Veterans Memorial Advisory Board, which is spearheading the drive
to build the memorial in Washington.
   He said the push for the memorial began after Vietnam veterans
began the offensive that culminated in the dedicated of their
monument on the Mall in 1982. ``The Korea vets were saying,
`where's ours?''' he said.
   After several years of groundwork, organizing and lobbying, the
Korea vets won permission from Congress and the Interior Department
this year to erect a privately financed memorial on the Mall. The
initial budget is $6 million, with veterans required to repay any
seed money advanced from the Treasury.
   The location is still undecided, but the American Battle
Monuments Commission is recommending a site near the Lincoln
Memorial and across a reflecting pool from the Vietnam Memorial.
   Once the location is chosen, the board will hold a competition
to select a design to reflect the board's concept that it ``must
radiate a message that is at once inspirational in content and
timeless in meaning ... unique in concept, designed for public
use.''
   Kenney says that $2.2 million has been raised so far, with $1
million coming from Hyundai Motor America, the U.S. subsidiary of
the Korean automaker, and nearly $300,000 coming from Hyundai
dealers.
   Among some 3,500 contributors, the Disabled American Veterans
have given $500,000, the VFW $250,000 and the Paralyzed Veterans of
America $100,000, according to Kenney, whose goal is ``to put up a
good memorial on what I call everybody's front lawn.''
   Kenney says that a Korean War memorial is needed because ``in
the long run, the nation owes some form of recognition to those
who, without all the fanfare of a war to save the world, marched
off quietly to fight for freedom for a people they never heard of
because their country asked them to do so.''

   Deposed Haitian President Leslie
Manigat said Monday that Haitian military men who are known friends
of the United States were involved in the coup that ended his
nation's 4-month experiment in democracy.
   He told a news conference his policies were poorly understood by
Washington and the ``nationalist and progressive'' orientation of
his government was misinterpreted. As a result, the United States
stood by as the coup proceeded, Manigat said.
   Manigat came to Caracas on Friday from his exile home in Miami.
He is campaigning to gain world support for a democratic front of
Haitian politicians aimed at restoring democracy to Haiti.
   ``Finally I can say that various officials involved in the coup
are known and perceived as friends of the U.S.,'' Manigat said.
   He went on, ``I was recently informed by a high-level U.S.
official that in the CIA and the Pentagon there was a lot of
confusion and doubt regarding the orientation of our government,
and that they were not convinced when we called it nationalist and
progressive.
   ``It seems like another error of my government was to want to
remove the Haitian police from the army and put ... (the police)
under the Justice Ministry ... This was interpreted by some
military officials, and by those who see through their eyes, as a
weakening of the army.''
   Manigat said that when he left Haiti for the Dominican Republic
following the May 19 military coup, someone asked him if he had
consulted with the United States before trying to remove Lt. Col.
Henri Namphy, who removed Manigat instead.
   ``Don't you know that you can't change any army commander
without first hearing the opinion of the U.S. Embassy?'' the person
said, according to Manigat.
   Manigat gave no details about the individual.
   The desposed leader called for the world's democracies to
repudiate publicly Namphy's military regime.
   Manigat said he will seek Venezuela's support in meetings with
President Jaime Lusinchi and others before returning to Miami on
Friday and will meet with other Haitian politicians this weekend in
Miami.
   Manigat spent 1978-86 in exile in Venezuela during the
repressive Duvalier era in Haiti, and developed close contacts with
members of the Social Christian Party.
   Namphy headed a three-man junta that took over the Haitian
government in February 1986, when dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled into exile. Manigat was elected last January in elections that
many Haitians claimed were rigged by the army.
   Manigat placed Namphy under house arrest after overriding
Namphy's orders for changes in the army. Soldiers loyal to Namphy
freed him June 19 and Namphy deposed Manigat, who was put on a
plane to neighboring Dominican Republic the following day.

<TEXT>
   Historian James Wesley Silver, whose book
criticizing white supremacy in Mississippi led to his dismissal
from the University of Missisippi faculty in the 1960s, died Monday
at 81.
   Family members said Silver's death was due to complications from
emphysema.
   Silver came to Ole Miss in 1936 and left in 1965 at the request
of the university's board of trustees following publication in 1964
of ``Mississippi: A Closed Society.''
   The book explored the racial divisions in the state and sharply
criticized its white political establishment.
   ``He was controversial from the day he was born,'' his wife,
Margaret, said Monday from her home in Dunedin, Fla. ``He liked
nothing better than upsetting (former Gov.) Ross Barnett and people
like that.
   ``We were big troublemakers. I think he did a lot of good,'' she
said.
   Silver's other books include ``Confederate Mississippi and
Church Propaganda,'' ``A Life for the Confederacy,'' ``Mississippi
in the Confederacy'' and ``Running Scared: Silver in Mississippi,''
his account of his own experiences there.
   After leaving Ole Miss, he taught at the University of Notre
Dame and then at the University of South Florida in Tampa, from
which he retired in 1979.
   In 1984, Silver returned to Oxford to be honored by Ole Miss. In
an interview that same year, he said he held no hard feelings about
the past.
   ``There were a bunch of dummies running things in the '60s, but
there were some fine people, too,'' he said. ``I think Mississippi
has done well in the last 20 years.''
   He was born in Rochester, N.Y. He attended the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill and received his doctorate in history
from Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
   Survivors include his wife, a son, and two daughters. No funeral
service was planned.

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday night he is optimistic a truce date in the Iran-Iraq
war can be set within 10 days. Iraq said it would be out of all
newly won Iranian territory by Tuesday.
   The U.N. chief spoke on ``The MacNeil@Lehrer Newshour'' TV
program after saying earlier that he scheduled separate talks for
Wednesday with the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq to pave the
way for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire in their 8-year-old war.
   The official Tanjug news agency in Belgrade reported Monday that
Yugoslavia accepted a U.N. call to contribute military officers to
monitor such a truce. Tanjug said about 250 U.N. truce observers
from throughout the world will be sent to Iran and Iraq once a
cease-fire was declared, but gave no specifics.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq asked to meet this week to
discuss a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and
formal peace negotiations. Iraq had sought face-to-face talks with
Iran.
   Perez de Cuellar said Monday he would not impose direct talks
between Iran and Iraq, but hoped both sides would agree to such
negotiations later.
   Aziz was expected at U.N. headquarters Tuesday.
   Appearing on the same broadcast as Perez de Cuellar were the
Iraqi U.N. ambassador, Ismat Kittani; the Iranian envoy, Mohammad
Ja'Afar Mahallati, and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Vernon Walters.
   Kittani said that by Monday midnight, ``all Iraqi forces will
have completed their withdrawal to our side of the internationally
recognized border. ... We have no intention of occupying and
holding Iranian territory for bargaining.''
   Mahallati said Iran ``is ready to immediately observe a
cease-fire'' and that he does not object to direct talks between
Iran and Iraq.
   He again charged that Iraq used chemical weapons in its latest
military offensive and Kittani refused to deny it.
   Walters said he viewed Kittani's announcement about withdrawing
from Iranian territory as a ``positive sign.''
   ``I think they (Iran and Iraq) both made a decision to go for
peace,'' the U.S. envoy said. ``Eight yars is a long time, you get
weary.''
   Walters said he was optimistic peace would result. The Iran-Iraq
war began in September 1980.
   ``I'm an old soldier. I know what war involves. I have seen the
bodies being put into body bags and that's when you really know
what war is about. And there have been almost a million bodies put
into body bags (in the Persian Gulf war) and that has an impact on
nations,'' Walters said.
   ``It's their coming generation that they're going to be losing
and I think that's why they have both come to the conclusion that
this is the time to stop.''
   Iran has said peace efforts could be jeopardized by Iraq's
latest offensive, intended to strengthen its position at the
bargaining table.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, arrived in New York
Monday and the Iranian Mission said he would meet Tuesday with the
president of the Security Council, Paulo Nogueira-Batista of Brazil.
   Perez de Cuellar said last week that ``the Iranians are not yet
prepared to have direct talks,'' so he would conduct shuttle
diplomacy, meeting each delegation separately as they go to his
38th-floor office.
   The new impetus to the peace process came July 18 when Iran
suddenly announced it would accept Security Council Resolution 598,
which demands an immediate cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war. Iran
had resisted for one year.
   But Iraq, which accepted the resolution a year ago, abruptly
called for immediate, face-to-face talks in New York before a truce
goes into effect.
   U.N. officials meanwhile warned that plans for U.N. truce
supervision could be jeopardized by the world body's financial
crisis, largely caused by U.S. arrears of $467 million _ two-thirds
of the total U.N. debt. The United States has been withholding its
legal U.N. contribution for years to compel the organization to
institute reforms.
   A U.N. technical team of military experts was bound for Tehran
to start working out details of a truce. It later will visit
Baghdad. A separate team arrived in Tehran to look into the
prisoners of war situation and later will visit Baghdad.
   At the State Department in Washington Monday, spokesman Charles
Redman reaffirmed U.S. willingness to talk with Iran, but said he
knew of no contacts planned with Velayati.
   The Security Council held closed-door consultations Monday on
Iran's protest against Iraq's latest alleged use of chemical
weapons. It adjourned without taking action.

<HEAD>Oil Rig Explosion Cuts Into Britain's Balance Of Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The offshore oil platform explosion that killed
167 people will cost Britain more than $500 million in lost energy
sales, the government announced Monday.
   In Aberdeen, Scotland, police said the body of one more worker
had been pulled from the North Sea on Monday, bringing the total
bodies recovered to 42.
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson told Parliament that the fiery
blast that tore apart the Piper Alpha oil rig June 6 also knocked
five related platforms out of production.
   The shutdown of all six North Sea platforms cut Britain's oil
production 12 percent and natural gas production 1 percent,
Parkinson said.
   He said the five associated platforms could be back in service
in a few months, but Britain was not producing 180,000 barrels of
oil per day as the rigs stood idle. He estimated the cost in lost
energy sales at $516 million.
   Piper Alpha, 120 miles off Scotland's eastern coast, produced
120,000 to 130,000 barrels a day before it exploded in the worst
disaster in oilfield history.
   Parkinson told the 650-member House of Commons that the
government would accept any safety recommendations stemming from
investigations into the tragedy.
   The Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., which is the
operator and main owner of the platform, said four workers remain
hospitalized. The company said 125 men are still missing.
   Winds gusting to more that 40 mph Monday prevented Texas
troubleshooter Red Adair and his oil-fire experts from boarding the
stricken platform.
   They were still trying to tame two burning wellheads. Fires at
two other wells are being controlled by injecting sea water to
dampen the flames, Occidental said, and three other wells have been
plugged with cement.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek and American negotiators started
another round of talks Monday for a new U.S. bases agreement, just
12 days after the socialist government announced it was ending the
current accord.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos stressed that ``we're
not negotiating an extension of the existing agreement, but a new
one.''
   He also repeated Premier Andreas Papandreou's pledge that a new
agreement must be approved by a referendum before it can take
effect.
   The current five-year agreement expires in December this year.
On July 13, Greece formally notified the United States in writing
that the 1983 pact was ending and that the bases should be
dismantled by 1990.
   Western diplomats said the notification is considered a
formality that will not affect this week's talks.
   Negotiations have been slowed by Athens' insistence that a new
accord should express support for Greece in its dispute with Turkey
over the Aegean region.
   The American position is that an agreement on military bases
should not be broadened to include political backing for Greece.
   Papandreou and the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement came
to power in 1981 on a platform that called for closure of the four
main American bases and 20 smaller installations, but later
modified its positions.
   The party indicated in a document published last week that the
bases may be allowed to stay. It said the party maintains a
long-term goal of shutting down the bases, but ``with a decisive
contribution to our national defense, a continuation of defense
cooperation is possible.''
   Greece receives $343 million yearly in U.S. military credits as
a form of rent for the bases.
   About 3,500 U.S. servicemen are stationed in Greece, mostly at a
U.S. Air Force support base next to Athens airport and at another
Air Force facility on the island of Crete.

   Hundreds of people were evacuated from lower
floors of the West Coast's tallest building Monday when an
electrical fire filled two floors and the atrium area with smoke,
officials said. The fire was quickly doused.
   There were no injuries in the blaze in the 76-story Columbia
Seafirst Center. Fire Department Lt. Herb Brooks said the fire was
reported about 12:15 p.m. and controlled 10 minutes later.
   Firefighters helped put out the blaze, but sprinklers did most
of the work, said Deputy Chief Rod Bower.
   A lack of sprinklers was cited as a factor in a fatal fire May 4
in another West Coast skyscraper, the 62-story First Interstate
Bank building in Los Angeles. One person died and 40 were injured
in that blaze.
   Bower said Monday's fire was believed to have been started by an
electrical short.
   Damage hadn't been estimated yet, but would be substantial,
Bower said. There was extensive damage to wiring between the third
and fourth floors as well as smoke damage, he said.

   A fiery explosion at a chemical plant
early Monday critically injured two employees and forced about 300
people from their homes during the night, authorities said.
   Houses near the Unocal Corp. plant in suburban Chicago were
evacuated for about two hours when thick black fumes drifted
through the area, police said.
   ``We heard the explosion and jumped out of bed like a spring,''
said Sophie Robish, who lives two blocks from the plant.
   Authorities had not determined if the fumes were toxic.
   ``I just got done reading and was getting ready for bed when I
heard this very loud boom,'' said Katie Dyrda, another nearby
resident.
   She said police asked residents to leave their homes about an
hour after the 1 a.m. explosion. Mrs. Dyrda said she grabbed her
3-year-old son, Sean, and headed for a nearby community center set
up for the evacuees.
   Investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
the Illinois EPA were at the scene, about 13 miles southwest of
Chicago, trying to determine the cause of the blaze, said Chuck
Corkery of the Cook County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency.
   The polymer manufacturing plant makes latex, an adhesive that
binds materials in paint together. The blast apparently occurred in
an area where combustible materials are used, especially designed
with reinforced walls to minimize damage from an explosion, said
John Maher, manager of field services at the Unocal's chemical
division in suburban Schaumburg.
   ``All we know is that they were in the process of feeding
chemicals into a reactor, and it exploded,'' said Police Sgt.
Thomas Frale.
   Two employees were in critical condition at Loyola University
Medical Center in nearby Maywood, said nursing supervisor Diane
Geeting. Two other injured employees were in good condition at
another hospital.

   About 300 aborigines smashed windows,
damaged cars and fought with police late Monday following the
funeral of an aboriginal man who died in a jail cell.
   Police reported seven people were arrested during the violence
in Geraldton, a town in Western Australia state 360 miles north of
Perth.
   Geraldton police superintendent Adrian Barnes said no one was
seriously injured in the rioting.
   Mayor Faye Campbell estimated the damage at $80,000.
   Some of the aborigines had attended the funeral Monday of Edward
Charles Cameron, 23, who was found hanged in a cell at the town
jail on July 8. He had been charged with breaking into a store and
was awaiting trial.
   After the service the aborigines marched to a building in
central Geraldton where the Western Australia state Cabinet was
meeting and a delegation met with Premier Peter Dowding and Police
Minister Ian Taylor.
   The delegation, led by Cameron's father and aboriginal elder
Leedham Cameron, called for the removal of the policeman in charge
of the inquiry into the jail death.
   Cameron said important information relating to his son's death
had been withheld by the investigating officer, inspector Eric
Cousins, but he did not elaborate. Taylor refused the delegation's
demand that he remove Cousins from the inquiry.

   Iraq said Monday it will withdraw from
Iranian territory captured in the past week, prompting hopes of
quiet on the long border warfront when peace talks begin at the
United Nations in New York.
   Announcers interrupted regular state television programs to say
the army would withdraw on Tuesday from territory captured in the
central border region.
   ``They will be withdrawn in line with our declared policy that
we have no territorial ambitions in Iran,'' said a military
communique read by the announcers.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in New York
Monday night he is optimistic a truce date in the Iran-Iraq war can
be set within 10 days. The war began in September 1980.
   Appearing on the ``The MacNeil@Lehrer Newshour'' TV program with
the U.N. chief were U.N. ambassadors Ismat Kittani of Iraq,
Mohammad Ja'Afar Mahallati of Iran and Vernon Walters of the United
States.
   Kittani announced that by midnight Monday New York time, ``all
Iraqi forces will have completed their withdrawal to our side of
the internationally recognized border. ... We have no intention of
occupying and holding Iranian territory for bargaining.''
   He refused to deny a complaint by Mahallati that Iraq used
chemical weapons in its latest military offensive.
   Mahallati also said Iran ``is ready to immediately observe a
cease-fire'' and that he does not object to direct talks between
Iran and Iraq.
   Walters commented: ``I think they (Iran and Iraq) both made a
decision to go for peace. Eight years is a long time, you get
weary.''
   At U.N. headquarters Monday, members of the Security Council
began private consultations on Iran's complaint that Iraq used
chemical weapons in a weekend offensive in violation of the 1925
Geneva Convention.
   Perez de Cuellar scheduled separate meetings for Wednesday with
the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq, Ali Akhbar Velayati and
Tariq Aziz, in an attempt to reach a truce.
   ``I plan to begin to talking to each separately and I hope this
might lead to direct talks,'' he said as he entered U.N.
headquarters Monday.
   Iraq's withdrawal announcement came after Iran said its military
units attacked Iraqi forces in southern Iran early Monday, forcing
them to retreat 25 miles and killing or wounding 1,500 men.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, claimed an Iraqi jet fighter was shot down over the border
town Sar-i Pol Zhaab. Iraq said its aircraft flew 261 sorties and
all returned safely.
   On Sunday, Iraq said it had withdrawn from territory seized in a
drive last week toward Ahwaz in southern Iran. Both offensives
occurred after Iran announced acceptance of a year-old Security
Council truce resolution, and Iran accused Iraq of trying to
sabotage peace efforts.
   Diplomats and officials in Baghdad described the attacks as an
attempt to strengthen Iraq's hand in peace talks.
   Monday's communique said Iraq has ``taught the Iranian regime a
lesson. We will wait to see how they will react vis-a-vis peace and
direct negotiations.''
   The Baghdad communique identified towns being evacuated as
Qasr-e Shirin, Gilan Gharb, Soummar and Sar-i Pol Zhaab, and said
Iraqi soldiers also would leave the villages of Sale Abad, Mir Abad
and Golan. It indicated the Iraqis were leaving willingly, not
because of Iranian military pressure.
   ``Now that our forces achieved their targets and liberated our
national territories, our political command has issued orders that
our withdrawal will start as of Tuesday, July 26, from all cities
and places we occupied inside Iran,'' the communique said.
   Iran claimed the Iraqis were driven out.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, interrupted regular programs
to say Iranian soldiers ``succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties
on the enemy'' and Iraqi bodies dotted the battlefield.
   It broadcast martial music, along with praise for Iran's
soldiers and exhortations for civilians to volunteer.
   Neither side's claims could be confirmed independently. Foreign
journalists and observers are allowed into war zones only on rare
guided tours.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini received visitors on Monday who
chanted ``Please God keep Khomeini alive!'' and ``We are all your
soldiers! We will obey your orders!'' and the 87-year-old
revolutionary leader responded by waving his hand, Tehran radio
said.
   Resolution 598, which the Security Council passed unanimously
July 20, 1987, provides for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized
borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation
of which side started the war.

<HEAD>Hungary To Open Limited Stock Exchange Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist government will open a
limited stock exchange in Budapest on Jan. 1 with members only
permitted to buy and sell shares, according to the head of the
securities trade secretariat.
   Ilona Hardy, in an interview with the government daily Magyar
Hirlap published Monday, said financial institutions that conduct
weekly ``dealers days'' that were introduced earlier this year
would discuss the establishment of a self-governing council and an
ethics committee at a meeting Tuesday.
   Establishment of a stock exchange even with a severe restriction
on membership is a significant break from the anti-capitalist
economics followed by Hungary and other eastern European nations
following Soviet domination at the end of World War II.
   Hardy was quoted as saying the creation of a closed joint-stock
company could be followed by the transformation of other companies
into joint-stock firms with the stock exchange establishing their
value.
   The planned stock exchange is to open at the same time that a
new law on companies goes into effect.
   Government officials have said the law, now in the drafting
stage, will be presented to Parliament in the fall. It is to put
state, cooperative and private enterprise firms on an equal footing
and limit state monopolies in some areas.
   Hardy said about half of the securities issued in the first six
months of this year, valued at the equivalent of $74 million, have
been sold on secondary markets.
   According to the official MTI news agency, which carried
excerpts of the interview, Hardy said the bond rate has dropped to
between 90 and 93 percent, leading issuers to offer bonuses worth
between 1 and 3 percent in an effort to create a higher demand.
   On July 1, interest rates on private deposits rose by an average
4 percent, making bonds issued last year with a fixed interest less
attractive, MTI said.

   Dozens of people gathered on a
mountaintop in central Puerto Rico Monday for a quiet ceremony
marking the 10th anniversary of the police killing of two young
supporters of independence for Puerto Rico.
   Two other commemorative dates fell on Monday _ the 36th
anniversary of the signing of the constitution that established
Puerto Rico as a semi-autonomous U.. Commonwealth, and the 90th
anniversary of the U.S. military occupation of Puerto Rico in 1898.
   Young girls laid flowers and Puerto Rican flags on the spot
where Carlos Soto Arrivi, 18, and Arnaldo Dario Rosado, 24, were
shot on July 25, 1978, and speakers demanded that those responsible
for the deaths be brought to justice.
   ``We're here to demand that the Popular Democratic Party
government fulfill its promises to jail those officials of (former
Gov.) Carlos Romero Barcelo's government who covered up these
murders,'' said Carlos Gallisa, secretary-general of the Socialist
Party.
   Romero Barcelo of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party was
governor at the time of the killings. The Popular Democrats are now
in control.
   About 70 miles away, in the capital city of San Juan, an
estimated 50,000 people gathered in front of the seaside capitol
building for speeches, singing and dancing to mark the
constitution's 36th anniversary.
   A jubilant Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, who is seeking
re-election in November, spoke for 30 minutes about his
administration's achievements. Then he rolled up his shirt-sleeves
and leaped off the 12-foot-high stage into the waiting arms of
supporters and circulated through the crowd pressed around him.
   Four Air National Guard jets roared overhead in formation as
dozens of people stood on a hill across from the capitol, holding
up red, white and blue placards to form a Puerto Rican flag.
   Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 after the
Spanish American War. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens with most of
the rights of their mainland counterparts except that in Puerto
Rico they cannot vote for president.
   Most islanders are divided between supporting the current
commonwealth status or statehood. About 5 percent voted in the last
election for the party that supports independence from the United
States.
   Rosado and Soto Arrivi were killed in a police ambush when they
went up to a remote mountain called Cerro Maravilla (Marvel
Mountain), purportedly to gain publicity for independence by
blowing up a transmitter.
   They were led there by a police informant, who has since been
assassinated by an underground group that said it was avenging the
two deaths.
   Police first said they killed the two in an exchange of gunfire,
but a Senate investigation later revealed that Rosado and Soto
Arrivi were shot at close range while on their knees after having
surrendered.
   Six policemen are serving long prison sentences for murder in
the killings and eight officers in all have been convicted of
perjury for lying to two federal grand juries.
   The killings are still under investigation. The Senate and a
specially appointed independent prosecutor are trying to find out
if government officials were involved in the cover-up.

   Republican George Bush, after outlining a $2.2
billion child-care program designed to help close his gender gap
with women, is turning his attention to selecting a running mate.
   The vice president says he expects to have ``some kind of a
list'' of potential running mates prepared by sometime this week,
although he hopes to delay announcing his choice until the GOP
convention next month.
   The certain Republican presidential candidate was expected to
spend much of this week mulling over his vice presidential
selection and had few campaign events scheduled.
   Meanwhile, Bush was drawing mixed reviews for his proposal for
child-care tax credits of up to $1,000 per child for low-income
families. For the neediest families _ those earning less than
$10,000 a year _ the ``credit'' would become a direct government
payment of the maximum $1,000 for each child of four or younger.
   Bush made the proposal Sunday in a speech to the National
Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs in
Albuquerque, N.M., ending a five-day burst of campaigning in seven
states.

   Americans overwhelmingly favor maintaining or
increasing the federal budget for space exploration, even while
three in 10 doubt NASA's competence, a Media General-Associated
Press poll has found.
   The national survey of 1,223 adults found that nearly half those
questioned lost confidence in the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration after the space shuttle Challenger exploded in
January 1986, and 60 percent of those, or 28 percent of all
questioned, say they still lack faith in the agency.
   However, 40 percent of the respondents said the United States
was doing too little in space exploration, and majorities supported
the initiatives of building a space station and sending manned
flights to Mars.
   The space shuttle program also won support, with 40 percent
saying it should be expanded and as many saying it should be
maintained. The first shuttle flight since the Challenger disaster
is scheduled for September, although a leak in a gas line is
threatening to delay it.

   The drought that has forced Okefenokee
Swamp's wildlife to gather near deeper pools and its alligators to
engage in cannibalism, is necessary for the survival of the swamp,
a parks official says.
   ``The swamp has tolerated drought for thousands of years.
Drought is a part of the biological process that creates open water
areas and marsh areas,'' said John Schroer, manager of the
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
   Swamp vegetation dries out during a drought, increasing the
chance of wildfire ignited by lightning. But, Schroer said,
wildfires are necessary because they burn off floating islands of
peat, which eventually can turn into dry land. Indians dubbed the
swamp ``the land of the trembling earth'' because of the undulating
peat.

   President Reagan said Monday the time has come
for the United States to talk to Iran about Americans held hostage
in Lebanon, if Tehran's leaders are ``willing and ready.''
   Reagan did not elaborate, but an administration official noted
earlier in the day that the United States had sent a new message to
Iran last week asking about the possibility of talks aimed at
normalizing relations. Tehran still has not sent an ``authorized''
reply, the official said.
   The official, who asked not be identified, said the United
States would like to talk to the Iranians about ending the Persian
Gulf war, the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon, and
terrorism. But he said the U.S. message did not specify conditions
for a resumption of relations, severed in 1980.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III attacked two
of his former top aides Monday, saying they triggered an
independent counsel's 14-month criminal investigation of him by
failing to conduct a ``competent and thorough'' inquiry in the

   Meese told the National Press Club that if Deputy Attorney
General Arnold Burns and criminal division chief William Weld had
done their jobs correctly, there probably would have been no basis
for independent counsel James McKay to investigate Meese.
   McKay recently concluded that Meese ``probably'' broke criminal
laws on four occasions, but the independent counsel did not seek an
indictment. Meese has since announced he will resign, probably by
mid-August, and has pronounced himself ``completely vindicated.''

   Emilio Ponce, a combat-tempered

should help improve living standards for the rural poor, campesinos
as they are called.
   ``Build a coop and set up a chicken-raising enterprise, teach
them how to plant vegetables, the raising of pigs,'' he said.
``These are cheap projects, more immediate. The people see problems
resolved more quickly, and it leaves them with a tool they can use
for life.''
   Ponce, 41, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, added that he has
set aside some of his troops for that purpose and indicated he
believed similar efforts should be made all around the countryside
by the military.
   High-ranking military sources say he is the most likely officer
to succeed Gen. Adolfo Blandon as chief of the joint chiefs of
staff when Blandon retires in the coming months.
   Ponce said he uses two kinds of military units in his command.
   ``One is eminently operative, for carrying out offensive
military operations that principally strike (guerrilla) commanders
at different levels. These are units trained for night operations,
ambushes and long-range patrols. The other type of unit carries out
first a military role but then fulfills a political function,'' he
explained.
   ``We cannot think that solely by military means we are going to
resolve this war. Even if we kill all the subversives, the problem
will not end. Such deplorable socio-economic conditions would
remain that it (the insurgency) could easily revive.
   ``This is an ideological and psychological war, a war for the
masses and a war of oganization.''
   Of the political work, he added, ``you always have to give the
campesinos something concrete, because they can't eat words.''
   Referring to two previous, and unsuccessful, development
projects designed by U.S. advisers to win over the populace, he
said: ``It's no longer a matter of building schools or paving
roads. What we're doing requires less sophistication and less
bureaucracy.''
   Ponce said his strategy is producing positive results in his
eastern command zone.
   But two commanders of the guerrillas' Farabundo Marti Liberation
Front, known as the FMLN, contended in interviews broadcast by the
rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos that an army that represents
El Salvador's status quo can never win the poor farmer's heart.
   Commander Jorge Melendez said the fact that rebel forces are
still active in all of the country's 14 provinces, although
outnumbered 8-1 by government troops, means the army ``has failed
militarily.''
   ``The root of this failure is in the nature of the FMLN, which
arises precisely from those same popular sectors,'' he said.
   Rebel commander Francisco Mena Sandoval said in a separate
interview in June: ``The objectives in the mind of each combatant
have to be expressions of the true interests of his people ... and
that's why neither (Defense Minister Gen. Carlos) Vides Casanova
nor the Americans could ever convert (the rural poor) to the cause
of foreign interests that have nothing to do with our particular
problems.''
   The rural poor make up 60 percent of El Salvador's population of
5.1 million.
   Four U.S. Army experts who studied El Salvador also see the key
to the war as lying with the loyalty of the rural poor.
   Cols. James Hallums, Richard White, A.J. Bacevich and Thomas
Young addressed the subject in a paper they wrote in March at
Harvard University, titled ``American Military Policy in Small
Wars: The Case of El Salvador.''
   Of the campaign for the allegiance of the populace, the officers
concluded that ``disappointment with the outcome (of previous
efforts) convinced hard-core Salvadoran commanders to forget about
`hearts and minds' in favor of pursuing guerrillas.''
   Of the U.S. role, the paper says: ``Despite their appreciation
that winning popular support remains as the ultimate strategic aim
in counterinsurgency, American officials have yet to devise
adequate mechanisms to achieve that aim.''

<HEAD>Venice Preparing to Test System to Protect It from Sea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the sirroco blows up the Adriatic from
the deserts of Libya, Venice's lagoon swells up and spills into the
city. Sirens sound a mournful reminder: Venice is losing its
struggle with the environment.
   Even at the height of summer, gondoliers ply their trade over
murky green and often foul-smelling canals alive with algae
thriving on tons of raw sewage.
   But a group of scientists and engineers are finally preparing to
test the prototype of a system to protect Venice from the sea that
once protected it.
   After nearly four years of work and $700 million in costs, the
engineers in the fall will install at the Lido entrance to the
Venice lagoon the prototype of a mobile dike designed to stem the
flood tides that have troubled the city's past and threaten its
future.
   ``The goal of the project is to save Venice, to save the life of
the lagoon, to save the port, to save the historic city and the
economic life of its people,'' said Maurio Fabris, director of
public relations for the Venezia Nuova (New Venice) consortium.
   He said the consortium of 26 Italian companies is executing the
10-year, $4.4 billion-project to build a line of mobile dikes
across the lagoon's three entrances, shore up the sea walls and
islands, preserve the canals and restore the ecological balance in
the polluted lagoon.
   Venetians built their island city along 150 winding canals to
protect themselves from invaders. Now the threat comes from the sea
that once guarded them.
   High tides flood the city about 100 times a year, corroding
magnificent churches, monuments and the marble walls of elegant
villas.
   The consortium intends to stem the tides with the mobile dikes
strung across the bottom of the lagoon entrances. During flood
tides, Fabris said, engineers will raise the dikes, effectively
sealing the lagoon. Ships will be able to sail in and out through a
series of locks at the entrances.
   ``With the mobile system we will be able to decide at what point
and at what time we want to intervene,'' said Fabris.
   Flood tides are triggered by differences in atmospheric pressure
at either end of the Adriatic or by the sirocco wind blowing across
the Mediterranean and up the Adriatic, driving the sea water
northward toward Venice.
   Great flood tides were heavily destructive to Venice in 789, in
1268 and in 1280. In 1410, they killed close to 1,000 people. In
this century, the worst floods came in 1916, 1936, 1951 and in
1966, when high water caused an estimated $85 million damage.
   Venetians have struggled for centuries to protect the city from
its surroundings. These efforts have included building sea walls to
guard the littoral islands and several anti-silting projects.
   More recently they succeeded in stopping Venice from sinking,
after it had settled 4{ inches from 1926 to 1970, by banning
industrial use of underground water.
   Critics say the government and the new consortium have reacted
slowly to Venice's problems, that the city has been drowning in a
sea of bureacracy and empty talk.
   The consortium's Fabris responds that the law creating the
project requires that all the work be ``experimentally tested,
reversible if necessary and done in stages.''
   Scientists used satellite analysis and computer models to study
how their work will effect the problems of stagnation and erosion.
Scale models of the entire lagoon and the three entrances were
built at Italy's hydraulic experimental center in nearby Padua.
   In September, workers will install the prototype of one of the
56-foot-high, 66-foot-long mobile dikes for six to eight months of
tests.
   Fabris said the consortium will be ready to put the entire line
of dikes in place by 1992.
   He added that the tests indicate that engineers will be able to
help wash pollutants out of the lagoon.
   As part of the project, the government is also supposed to enact
laws restricting the dumping of industrial pollutants and the use
of agricultural pesticides that seep into the lagoon.

<HEAD>Syrians Seek to Save Damascus' Old City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coppersmiths and carpenters still clatter
today at their ancient crafts along the ``Street called Straight,''
where the Bible says St. Paul was cured of blindness.
   Venders peddle vials of perfume beneath Roman columns near the
great 8th century Omayyed mosque. Stalls in the narrow market
streets still dazzle with spices, silver and silk in the city that
Saladin, scourge of the Crusaders, called home.
   Some of Damascus's old city survives, but it is in danger of
being swallowed by the sprawl of modern Syria.
   ``You can't imagine how important Damascus is, and how rich,''
said Afif Bahnassi, Syria's Director of Antiquities.
   He's one of about a dozen officials and experts named this year
to a committee charged with saving the flavor and heritage of this
ancient city, termed ``the Paradise of the Orient'' by the 12th
century Spanish traveller Ibn Jubayer.
   Busy streets now flank the old Roman walls, and mud-sided 19th
century neighborhoods nearby have fallen to highways and modern
housing needed for a growing metropolis of 3 million people.
   Even within the old walled city, ``we're afraid ... there's now
some opinion to remove the old houses,'' Bahnassi said in an
interview.
   The committee has set conditions on development and is working
to restore old neighborhoods. Bahnassi said it has asked owners to
restore their own buildings, and offers financial assistance for
those who need help.
   But he said it is difficult to find craftsmen skilled in the old
buildings' styles.
   ``We'd like to encourage the workers to be more interested in
the old systems,'' he said.
   Damascenes often refer to their city as the oldest still
inhabited, but its age is uncertain. Settlements excavated nearby
date to about 10,000 B.C.
   Damascus itself is referred to in Egyptian and other documents
dating back about 4,000 years, Bahnassi said.
   Arameans who migrated to the city from the deserts built a
temple to the god Haddad in about 1,000 B.C. The Romans used the
same site for their temple to Jupiter.
   Early Christians built a cathedral on the Roman foundations, and
elements of both remain in in the richly decorated Omayyed mosque,
Islam's oldest surviving monumental mosque.
   Among its shrines is one holding the head of John the Baptist,
revered by Moslems as well as Christians.
   According to Acts 9 in the New Testament, St. Paul, then Saul,
was stricken blind as he made his way to Damascus to persecute the
followers of Christ. He was taken to a house on the ``Street called
Straight,'' the account goes on. It says Ananias, a follower of
Christ, was instructed by a voice from Heaven to find Saul there
and cure him of his blindness.
   Nearly all the great empires of Middle Eastern history fought
over and conquered Damascus, whose oasis straddles three enduring
trade routes connecting Egypt, Arabia, Mesopotamia and Europe.
   Early Islamic authorities referred to Damascus' oasis as the
site of the Garden of Eden.
   ``The Gardens encircle it like the halo round the moon,'' Ibn
Jubayer wrote in the 12th century.
   Some say Cain slew Abel on the slopes of Mount Kassioun on the
city's Western edge, and placed Abraham's birthplace there.
   At the height of its glory under the Islamic Omayyed dynasty,
Damascus was the capital of an Arab empire that reached from Spain
to the edges of India.
   Yet despite its many wars, ``nobody in its history destroyed it
completely,'' said Harb Farzat, an historian at the University of
Damascus.
   The crowded streets and bazaars of the old city still conjure
images of medieval times. Upper stories project over the narrow
lanes, often nearly touching.
   Crumbling walls on some reveal the mud, wattle and wood
construction Ibn Jubayer noted in 1184, when Saladin used the city
as his capital during his successful campaign against the Crusaders
of Jerusalem.
   Ornate stone doorways open onto the luxurious marble floors and
fountains of restored Turkish baths, some dating to the 13th
century and still in use.
   Coffee houses hundreds of years old still serve thick, heavily
sugared Turkish coffee to men in Arab garb who puff at waterpipes
over games of backgammon.
   But Farzat, who was born in the city, said: ``When you've seen
Damascus a generation before, you can see how it has changed.''
   From a high-rise hotel window, he pointed at the sprawl of
concrete now covering the ghouta, the oasis gardens that led many
ancient authors to liken Damascus to paradise.
   The greatest loss, he said, was ``to destroy the ghouta, the
Paradise of Damascus. Now it's covered with buildings.''

   A sea of faded-green tents has become
home for 165,000 refugees _ mostly women, children and old men _ of
a stalemated war in the desert of nearby Western Sahara.
   Four-color flags of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic
Republic flutter in the hot wind, over banners and grafitti
proclaiming the republic's slogan: ``The Entire Homeland or
Martyrdom.''
   The United Nations and international relief organizations have
been feeding and housing the refugees for more than a decade.
   The refugees wait here in Algeria for something to happen in the
war between Morocco and the Marxist-led Polisario guerrilla
movement for control of the Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara.
   The Algeria-backed Polisario movement set up the Sahrawi
republic in 1976 after Spain turned Western Sahara over to Morocco
and Mauritania _ the latter has since withdrawn.
   Although the Sahrawi republic won diplomatic recognition from
more than 70 countries, mostly in the Third World, it has been
unable to gain a permanent foothold in the mineral-rich territory.
   The war has reached a stalemate and the guerrillas now talk of a
compromise settlement, but prospects seem distant and sporadic
fighting continues.
   Polisario officials contend the refugees in camps near this
Algerian oasis represent virtually the entire population of the
disputed territory.
   Spain held the Western Sahara until 1975, mainly to protect the
nearby Spanish Canary Islands. Little effort was made to develop
the wilderness, an area about the size of Colorado. Spanish
colonial records indicate the territory had a population of only
75,000 when Spain pulled out.
   At least 50,000 now live under Moroccan rule, frequently
proclaiming their loyalty to Morocco's King Hassan II.
   Morocco maintains that more than three-fourths of the Tindouf
refugees are not from Western Sahara but from neighboring
Mauritania, Niger, Mali and other impoverished countries on the
fringes of the Sahara Desert.
   Arabic-speaking Moslems, they originally were nomads, herding
goats and camels over unmarked boundaries, often not even aware
which country they were in.
   Mahmoud Hussein, a high-school pupil studying in Algiers, spoke
of the culture shock he experiences in traveling between the dual
worlds of modern Algiers and his family tent near Tindouf.
   ``I live in Algiers nine months of the year and I hate it and
long for my family,'' he said, sitting recently in the brightly
decorated tent beside his younger sister, Habiba. ``Then when I
come here for the three months of the summer, I'm dying to return.''
   He shares his perplexity with hundreds of young people who
travel to universities in Cuba or Spain.
   Polisario officials have set up a system to prevent loss of a
national and cultural identity among the young and to reinforce
their motivation to fight.
   ``The young teach the old how to read and write,'' said Mohammed
Mahmoud, a school teacher. ``The old teach them history and
tradition so as to enforce their sense of identity.''
   From age 9, the children also receive basic military training in
preparation for automatic conscription after high school of boys
who don't go on to university.
   Tindouf, a military zone, is 1,000 miles southwest of Algiers.
   The refugee camps begin about two miles west of Tindouf, their
rows of canvas tents and adjacent stone kitchens spread in clusters
over the stark landscape.
   At a camp hospital, Dr. Khadigetto Alawi said she had just
returned from five years of medical training in Havana, Cuba. She
said she and the other hospital staff receive no salaries.
   Polisario officials said no one receives any pay, including the
16,000-man guerrilla army and 70,000 officials. A few raise goats
and sheep for their own use, they said.
   A woman who identified herself as Humayed welcomed a group of
visiting reporters into the tent she shares with six women and
children of her family. She said their menfolk were ``at the
front'' 120 miles away.
   ``The women have an important role while the men are away at
war,'' said a Roman Catholic priest who goes by the name Father
Gonzales and works for the Caritas relief organization.
   ``They marry young, so as to have many children. And they also
undergo military training themselves. We try to teach them the
importance of mother-child care. They concentrate a lot on
preventive medicine.''
   A Polisario official said it is expected that young war widows
remarry quickly in order to maintain population growth. Ghalouha
el-Salm, a war widow-bride, said she has spent the nine years since
she lost her husband rearing a daughter but now is marrying again.
   ``I have to continue having children,'' she said, explaining
that it was a ``national'' requirement.
   Most of the women said they long to return to the Western Sahara
and its cool Atlantic breezes when the war is over.

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harassed by crop burnings, air
surveillance and cratering by police of illegal landing strips,
drug barons have begun to smuggle marijuana out of Jamaica in
shipments of pumpkins, books and flip-flop sandals.
   Business leaders say the traffic threatens Jamaica's entire
export industry, which along with tourism is the economy's most
vibrant. Thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in precious
foreign earnings are at stake.
   ``The problem is critical,'' said Lascelles Chin, managing
director of Henkel Chemicals. ``If this is not curtailed, we are
all in for a tough time.''
   Shippers say with the tough government measures against
trafficking, drug barons now are managing to slip marijuana, or
ganja as it is called here, into legal cargoes. Some have been
detected by U.S. Customs agents and the shipping companies, even
though they be be unaware of the shipments, face heavy fines.
   Many have become reluctant to handle Jamaican exports.
   In February, for example, a Kirk Lines ship, the Mercandian
Supplier, was found to be carrying 13,000 pounds of marijuana in
its cargo of crackers bound for Miami, Fla. The U.S. Customs
Service fined the company $103 million.
   The biggest cargo carrier to serve this Caribbean nation,
Evergreen Shipping of Taiwan, decided in June it will deliver but
no longer accept containers in Jamaica after U.S. Customs in New
Orleans found marijuana hidden aboard them in late 1986. The
company is negotiating with U.S. Customs on the amount of fines to
be imposed.
   U.S. Customs ordinarily imposes fines at the rate of $500 an
ounce of marijuana found, but it offers companies the opportunity
to present mitigating evidence in an effort to lower those set
amounts.
   Four Air Jamaica planes have been seized in New York and Miami
after contraband drugs were found aboard.
   Exports are vital to this poor island nation of 2.4 million
people, where one of every four members of the work force is
unemployed.
   As world markets and prices collapsed in the 1980s for Jamaica's
traditional products _ bauxite (from which aluminum is made), sugar
and bananas _ other exports have picked up the slack.
   About 29,000 jobs were created in factories making dresses,
pants and other clothes for U.S. companies. Last year, exports
raised more than $700 million in foreign exchange, which Jamaica
needs to buy oil, machinery, spare parts and food.
   The exporters' response to the ganja barons has been to screen
employees, implement tamper-resistant packaging, and monitor
production and delivery closely.
   ``I schedule it so my truck arrives at the dock as soon as the
gangplank is dropped,'' said Garfield Thomas, explaining that it
lessens the chances for marijuana to be hidden in his shipments of
fruits and vegetables.
   ``I give drivers cases of cold drinks and a can opener so they
don't have to stop on the way, and just hope they don't get a
puncture (flat tire).''
   Thomas added, however, that he has reduced his shipments because
the produce was spoiling on U.S. docks while awaiting clearance by
inspectors searching for drugs.
   But as one ruse is uncovered, another develops.
   ``Now we're finding marijuana in false bulkheads and false
roofs'' in the steel and fiberglass containers into which
merchandise is loaded, said Francis Kennedy, president of the
Shipping Association of Jamaica. ``We've never had this problem as
much as during the past six to eight weeks.''
   Laborers from India introduced ganja to Jamaica in the mid-19th
century. The subtropical climate is ideal for its cultivation; the
fastest growing varieties can be harvested every three months.
   Although cultivation and use of marijuana became common in
Jamaica, it posed few problems until traffickers started exporting
it. In the 1970s, cocaine smuggling increased as aircraft stopped
over for refueling en route from South America to the United States.
   Jamaica's two main political parties have condemned drug
trafficking and taken steps to halt it.
   In the 1970s, the People's National Party government of
socialist Prime Minister Michael Manley ordered illegal airstrips
spiked, encouraged farmers to grow legal crops, and seized
contraband planes.
   The current prime minster, conservative Edward Seaga of the
Jamaica Labor Party, which came to power in 1980, has imposed stiff
sanctions on traffickers, and threatened to shoot down drug planes.
Thousands of acres of marijuana fields have been cut down, and
hundreds of tons of marijuana have been burned.
   U.S. funding, particularly for the Operation Buccaneer crop
eradication program, increased to $3.4 million last year from
$49,000 in 1984.
   Now farmers, for whom ganja is their most marketable crop, plant
it on smaller patches in remote valleys and hillsides. They also
are experimenting with faster growing varieties, neglecting
traditional crops.
   Cocaine use, meanwhile, appears to be increasing among Jamaica's
upper and middle classes, and trafficking is feared to be
stimulating crime and corruption.
   Jamaican officials say they are grappling with the problem as
best they can. But they bristle at statements by U.S. officials and
at news accounts that they maintain cast Jamaica in a bad light.
They cite as one example the allegation that political parties
accept contributions from drug barons.
   ``It is U.S. citizens who are creating the demand for drugs,
subsidizing the planting of ganja in Jamaica and organizing and
managing the transporting of ganja from Jamaica,'' Minister of
Public Works Pearnel Charles was quoted as saying in a recent
interview with The Daily Gleaner of Kingston.
   In April, Prime Minster Seaga lodged a formal protest with the
U.S. State Department after he was linked in closed-door testimony
by a convicted drug trafficker before a Senate subcommittee with
accepting payoffs.
   The State Department responded that the charges were
unsubstantiated.

   The Reagan administration's crackdown
on drug trafficking is upsetting U.S. allies in the Caribbean. They
complain the United States is maligning their leaders and
encroaching on their sovereignty.
   ``It's just unsettling to people to hear that their leaders have
been charged in a court in America when anyone who knows anything
about justice knows these cases will never come up for a hearing,''
said Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica. ``It's not only
wrong, its incomprehensible.''
   The issue came up at a recent meeting of the leaders of 13
former and current British colonies in the Caribbean Community
(Caricom), in Antigua-Barbuda.
   The young parliamentary democracies, most of which gained
independence over the past 25 years, drafted a letter to President
Reagan protesting U.S. drug policy in the region.
   The contents of the letter were not disclosed, but it was
believed to have focused on U.S. investigations of government
leaders in the Caribbean, as well as Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the Panamanian strongman.
   Sir Lynden Pindling, prime minister of the Bahamas, is under
investigation by a Florida grand jury for alleged drug-related
offenses. He has denied any connection with the drug trade.
   At the Caricom summit, Pindling assailed the United States for
what he called its ``ideologically motivated, interventionist''
policies.
   In March, Col. Jean-Claude Paul of Haiti was indicted by a
federal grand jury for allegedly conspiring to import cocaine into
the United States. Paul, a key figure in Haiti's army, denied any
involvement.
   In May, a U.S. Senate subcommittee heard testimony by a
convicted drug trafficker that linked Prime Minister Edward Seaga
of Jamaica with payoffs. An incensed Seaga, whose marijuana
eradication program is the most comprehensive in Jamaica's history,
filed a formal complaint with the State Department, which later
said the testimony was unsubstantiated and baseless.
   ``People are concerned with the reputation of individuals,''
said Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel of Belize. ``I'm referring to
Senate witnesses that are free to commit libel ... and those people
who are libeled have no protection or recourse.''
   Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird of Antigua accused the Reagan
administration of exporting its battle against drugs to win votes
for Republicans in November.
   ``The domestic imperatives of an election year in America have
forced certain people ... to step beyond what is acceptable in
terms of ... the sovereignty of a country,'' he said.
   Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson of Trinidad-Tabago suggested that
countries work out ways to bring offenders to justice and ensure
that ``individuals are not just slandered and characters
assassinated ... or that countries should use the judicial process
for political ends.''

   Like good comedians, certain investment analysts
never run out of material.
   As one respected member of that fraternity observed earlier this
month, they followed the monetarists in the early 1980s, switched
to oil-watching in 1985 and jumped to commodities last year.
   ``And now _ drumroll please _ it is the meteorologists,''
observes Lucinda Mezy, director of equity research PNC Financial
Corp., a bank-holding company based in Philadelphia.
   The drought, that is, has developed brand new commentaries on
where the economy is headed. Billions of words have come from
brokerage houses on what the drought means for food prices, and
therefore for stocks.
   The political activities of 1988 provide myriad variations for
commentaries on interest rates, inflation, stock prices and
investor confidence. Each poll, whether or not it shows changes, is
reason again for further commentary.
   The Iran-Iraq affair already has been worked into forecasts by
analysts who could not think of anything more to say about
Nicarauga and the rest of Central America, and by bulls who had run
out of things to say about glasnost.
   Fallback resources include the emergence of China as an
industrial power, the amount of money in circulation, the budget
and trade deficits, the dollar, the possibility of inflation or
higher interest rates and Third World debt.
   Increasingly, analysts analyze analysts, producing one of the
oddest of all analyses, one that states the stock market is about
to rise when the majority of analysts are bearish, and is set to
fall when they turn bullish.
   There is an open pit mine, ready to be worked at any time, in
analyzing the disposition of investors. Do they have confidence? Do
they have money? Will they buy cars and appliances? Will they save?
Will they buy junk bonds?
   Government provides enough material, often in controversial
form, to keep armies of analysts computing and dissecting. Lists of
upcoming government economic announcements has become a regular
feature of brokers' letters.
   A rise or fall in housing starts is good for hundreds of words
on the consequences to securities. Inflation and interest rates,
jobless statistics, factory capacity, imports, exports, debt,
deficits all go into the mix.
   Still, without these events, institutions and subjects there
would hardly be a drought of material on which to comment. Always,
there is the mine of statistical material that can be dug up and
massaged by computer.
   That resource was well used and thoroughly abused in the weeks
and months immediately following the securities crash of last
October, the most common of the analyses producing statistics
likening it to the Great Crash of 1929.
   It mattered little that events failed to prove that 1987 was
1929 all over again; it simply provided more material for analysis
on why the two years differed. In themselves, differences of
opinion are fodder for analysis.
   How all this helps investors is difficult to perceive, but it is
easy enough to see how it helps those who sell securities. It keeps
customers talking. It maintains interest. It provides material for
sales calls.
   But almost if not utterly lost in the mountain of commentary is
the matter of accuracy. It is then that the words are seen for what
they are worth. In investing, those words just do not add up. Only
the numbers do.

   Before Monica Gonzalez goes to the United
States in September to receive a prize for courageous reporting
she'll have to get permission from a Chilean court.
   Pending against her are charges of criminally slandering
President Augusto Pinochet and the armed forces he commands.
   By law she must get approval to go abroad, but she brushes that
aside as just a minor annoyance compared to periodic arrests, two
stints in prison and daily death threats in the four years since
she took on what she calls ``the holy trinity'' _ Pinochet, his
family and the military.
   Her articles accusing Pinochet and his right-wing government of
abuse of power were cited by Harvard University's Nieman Foundation
in awarding her this year's Louis M. Lyon Prize. It praised her
``courage in reporting objectively and honestly ... despite the
government's efforts to silence her.''
   She plans to travel to Boston to accept the award Sept. 15, but
with a certain chagrin.
   ``There are lots of (Chilean) journalists who are facing legal
charges, but most aren't as famous as I,'' Mrs. Gonzalez, 38, said
in an interview. ``This bothers me a lot sometimes.''
   According to the local Roman Catholic Church's human rights
office, more than 30 journalists face criminal slander charges
lodged by the government.
   They include Mrs. Gonzalez' boss, Juan Pablo Cardenas, director
of the leftist magazine Analisis. He was convicted of offending the
armed forces and is serving 541 nights in a jail cell. He is at
liberty during the daytime.
   Pinochet cites the existence of Analisis and several other
opposition publications as proof that Chile has freedom of the
press. But according to Mrs. Gonzalez, ``There's a very high cost.
It's a cost you pay every day.''
   She said her telephone rings constantly with death threats, that
cars full of armed men regularly park outside her home, that a dead
cat was once tossed into her yard.
   ``Certainly I'm afraid.'' she said. ``I'm afraid they'll kill
me. But I've made a choice. I've taken a path of no return.''
   The choice was made in late 1983, she said, when she began
working for another opposition magazine, Cauce. At the time, a wave
of anti-Pinochet protests obliged the government to somewhat relax
its strict control of the news media.
   In early 1984, the magazine published the first of a series of
investigative reports by Mrs. Gonzalez alleging corruption by
Pinochet and members of his family and brutal human rights abuse by
the military. The articles, which presented documentation and
detail, established her reputation as one of the country's best
opposition journalists and shattered a powerful taboo.
   ``We broke a sacrosanct rule that existed in the opposition
press: don't mention Pinochet, his family or the armed forces. This
is the holy trinity,'' she said.
   In the years since, Mrs. Gonzalez has been arrested 10 times and
imprisoned twice in connection with her reporting.
   Her first imprisonment was in July 1984. She said she was put in
a small, exposed cell in a maximum-security punishment block
occupied by about 20 common criminals who had led a prison riot
three months earlier. Many still wore bandages on their wounds.
   She was the first woman they had seen since being isolated, and
regularly beaten, after the riot, she said. They filled the hall
outside her cell, screaming and pressing against the bars while
they exposed themselves and performed obscene acts.
   The bars were thin, and she feared they would cave in.
   ``It went on all night long,'' she said. ``I didn't think I was
going to be able to stand it. It was very terrible.''
   The next morning, at her tearful insistence, she was moved to a
section for woman political prisoners. She spent six days there
before being released.
   She would return in October 1987, for 22 days, after publishing
an interview with an opposition leader, Andres Zaldivar, who
sharply criticized Pinochet.
   The case sent chills through the Chilean jouralistic community
and prompted denunciations from press organizations around the
world. Although the interview was published in textual,
question-and-answer form, Mrs. Gonzalez _ and not Zaldivar _ was
charged with slandering the president. Government prosecutors said
she was responsible because she served as the vehicle for his
remarks.
   The case remains pending, as do two others, in which she is
accused of slandering a military prosecutor and the armed forces in
general. Five previous cases against her have ended in acquittal.
   She said she considers her most important story a series of
interviews in late 1984 with a deserter from the secret police who
recounted the torture and killing of 15 leftists. Some were old
friends of hers, she said.
   In seeking confirmation of the deserter's tale, she sought the
help of a human rights activist, Jose Parrada, and a Communist who
survived detention by the secret police, Manuel Guerrero.
   Parrada and Guerrero, along with a third man, Santiago Nattino,
were found dead with their throats slashed in March 1985.
   ``Why they let me live, I don't know,'' Mrs. Gonzalez said.
   ``Here they punish journalists who make terrible denunciations:
murders, torture, disappearances, corruption. But they don't
investigate the actions being denounced. That's hard for me to
accept.''

<HEAD>Egyptians Shut Down Brick Factories to Save Fertile Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GIZA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fertile soil is sparse in Egypt _ just 6
million acres along the Nile _ and the government is cracking down
on those who use it to make bricks.
   At a brickyard here one recent day, workers swarmed like bees
over a kiln as they dismantled a brickyard that had fallen victim
to the government order.
   The government's intend is to preserve Egypt's arable land to
help feed an exploding population _ now 53 million and growing at a
rate of 1.2 million a year.
   After five years of loose application of a law banning the use
of fertile topsoil to make bricks, the government in December set a
six-month deadline and recently sent police out to see that an
estimated 1,700 affected brickyards indeed close down.
   ``We admit that this is the first time the law has been
effective,'' said Farouk Zaki, head of the department responsible
for land protection at the Agriculture Ministry.
   ``The owners realized that we were serious this time and all the
brickyards stopped functioning on deadline without violence.''
   The decree requires brickyard owners to switch from the age-old
process of making bricks by hand with topsoil to a mechanized one
that makes bricks only with pure clay, thus eliminating the use of
topsoil.
   Violators of the topsoil ban face six months in prison and a
fine.
   Officials acknowledged that the decree has troublesome
side-effects: a growing black market in bricks and unemployment for
about 70,000 workers.
   Only 41 of the dismantled brickyards so far have switched to the
mechanized method, at a cost the equivalent in Egyptian pounds of
$13,000 to $650,000, Zaki said. He added that 200 others were
expected to follow suit.
   ``At the moment, the price of bricks is rising steeply because
of the law enforcement,'' said Mohammed Ramez, responsible for
building-material control at the Housing Ministry.
   He said black market prices of the machine-produced bricks are
double the official $30 for 1,000.
   ``We expect to have a complete balance between supply and demand
within five years,'' Ramez added. The enforcement of the law, he
said, has resulted in a shortage of 2 billion to 3 billion bricks
this year.
   Officials estimate that about 4,500 acres of arable land have
become unproductive in the last 20 years because topsoil was
stripped for bricks. The loss is considerable for a country that
produces only 40 percent of its food and must import the rest to
feed its burgeoning population.
   ``Some people used to remove earth down to 10 meters (30
feet),'' said Zaki of the Agriculture Ministry. ``Any removal
weakens the soil, taking away essential nutrients, and raises the
water table.
   ``We are requiring owners to reclaim their land _ at a cost of
10,000 to 15,000 pounds ($4,300 to $6,500) per acre,'' Zaki said.
He estimated this would take at least two years.
   The removal of topsoil began in the early 1970s after the High
Dam at Aswan went into operation and held back flood waters bearing
tons of silt that originally was used in the brick industry.
   As construction boomed in Egypt and the demand for bricks
sky-rocketed, some farmers abandoned their crops to make as much as
70 times more money by selling topsoil or making bricks on their
own.
   ``Earth bricks brought us enormous profits,'' said Ahmed
Abu-Rawash, a former brickyard owner in Giza.
   ``In a good month I would make 3,000 pounds ($1,300) with earth
from one of my acres.''
   He maintained that ``no harm is done to land scraped two meters
(about six feet) deep; anything can be planted on it.''
   Abu-Rawash has switched to raising cattle and has turned most of
his brickyard into a banana plantation, which he said brings only a
quarter of the profit he made from bricks.
   His employees, whose numbers have been trimmed from 50 to 20,
were busy one recent day dismantling one kiln with 22 others to be
taken down in the neighborhood.
   They were worried about their future.
   ``This is my first day of work since all the brickyards shut
down last month,'' Abdel-Hamid Sharafeddin said.
   ``I will work on the other kilns and then who knows? People like
me are pushed aside. I know nothing but brickmaking.''

<TEXT>
   In the 25 years he spent in jail as one of
Latin America's longest-held political prisoners, Napoleon Ortigoza
could sleep only when the light bulbs in his cell blew out.
   It happened, he said, about once every three months and when the
guards in his Paraguayan prison noticed it they quickly put in
fresh bulbs.
   But the lights burning night and day, the beatings, the
submersion in water and 18 years in 6-by-6-foot cell didn't
humiliate him as much, he said, as being tortured by a policeman
who ranked far below him, a captain in the Paraguayan army.
   ``I never thought a policeman could get away with torturing an
officer _ that's a crime,'' the 56-year-old Ortigoza said in an
interview here.
   ``They beat me, tied me up and held me under water, but nothing
hurt as much as when they ripped off my captain's braids.''
   He was sent to prison Dec. 17, 1962, on grounds that he was
involved in a military plot to overthrow Paraguay's longtime
authoritarian president, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, and that he had a
role in the death of an army cadet, Alberto Benitez _ charges he
has steadfastly denied from the beginning.
   This past Dec. 17, 25 years to the day he was sent to prison,
Ortigoza was released. He was granted political asylum in Spain in
June.
   Ortigoza blames his suffering on Stroessner, now 75, who has
ruled Paraguay since he seized power in 1954.
   ``I know he gave the order for my arrest. He robbed me of my
career,'' Origoza said.
   Origoza enlisted in the Paraguayan army in 1949, graduated at
the top of his class as a lieutenant and placed fourth when
promoted to captain.
   He was one of five army captains among 20 middle-level officers
convicted after Stroessner moved to smash a rumored plot in army
ranks.
   At the time, Ortigoza was serving as a staff officer to Cmdr.
Sixto Dure Franco, one of several regiment commanders supposedly
involved in the alleged army plot. Dure Franco and the others were
subsequently reconciled with Stroessner and promoted to the highest
posts in the military.
   ``I knew better than to get involved in some anti-Stroessner
game,'' Ortigoza said in the interview. He said he knew of the coup
plans, however, through Dure Franco.
   Shortly after his arrest, Ortigoza faced a civil court that
found him innocent of all charges.
   He was then brought before a military court that convicted him
of involvement in the coup and the murder of the cadet. He was
sentenced to death, but the sentence was reduced later to 25 years
in prison.
   ``Police forced me to write a letter implicating myself in the
cadet's murder,'' Ortigoza said.
   ``The lower-ranking officers became the scapegoats, once
Stroessner decided he didn't want to create a shakeup among the
higher officers.''
   In 1978, the Organization of American States (OAS) reviewed
Ortigoza's case and concluded it was ``arbitary and political'' and
a ``very grave violation of his human rights.''
   After the OAS conclusions, Paraguayan authorities permitted
Roman Catholic church officials to visit Ortigoza every four
months. His family could visit once a week.
   He spent the first 18 years of his sentence in what he described
as ``brutal conditions'' at a military police facility in Asuncion,
Paraguay's capital.
   In October 1980, Ortigoza was moved to a more comfortable
9-by-15-foot cell with a bathroom.
   ``The idea that sustained me through my time in jail was the
certainty I felt that I would some day be able to correct the
injustice done to me,'' he said.
   But his problems did not end with his release from prison in
December.
   The Interior Ministry sent Ortigoza to the San Estanislao
military garrison 120 miles north of Asuncion. The Supreme Court
accused the ministry of kidnapping Ortigoza and ordered him sent
back to Asuncion, where he was then placed under unofficial house
arrest at his mother's home.
   ``After I got tired of that, one of my lawyers helped me to
escape in a car,'' Ortigoza said. That was March 23.
   ``Police guards fired machine guns at the car, but we got away.
We hadn't planned to go to the Colombian Embassy, but when we saw
the gate to the compound open, we zipped right in.''
   Ortigoza spent 83 days there.
   On June 15, after talks with diplomats from Colombia, Spain and
Argentina, Paraguay dropped its opposition to giving Ortigoza safe
conduct out of the country.
   The next day he arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and
immediately departed for Madrid.
   Many countries and human rights organizations had called for his
release over the years. Norway offered him a lifetime pension if he
accepted its offer of asylum.
   But he said he chose Spain for ``reasons of language and
culture.''
   Ortigoza now lives in a faculty apartment at Madrid University,
where he was recently joined by his wife and one of his two
daughters.
   He recounts his experiences to students of Latin American
politics in a project funded by the Spanish Foreign Ministry's
Institute for Iberoamerican Cooperation.
   ``While Stroessner is alive there is no chance of reopening my
case,'' Ortigoza said in the interview. ``But I am prepared to
defend the truth to the end.''

<HEAD>Ancient Jewish Community Survives on Tunisia Island</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARA KHEBIRA, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This dusty Arab village on Jerba
Island is inhabited mostly by Jews whose ancestors were among the
earliest Middle East refugees 2,400 years ago. Uneasy about
Israel-Arab tension nowadays, they tend to keep a low profile.
   Most speak only Arabic and dress like the Tunisian peasants who
predominate on the island off Tunisia's southern mainland. Their
forefathers came with Phoenician traders after the destruction of
Solomon's Temple in 586 B.C., more than a millenium before the
foundation of Islam and the Arab invasions of North Africa.
   Almost throughout this long history, they have lived among the
local population in ``harmonious and brotherly coexistence,'' said
Haim Madar, Tunisia's chief rabbi, himself born 55 years ago in a
Moorish-style family home in Hara Khebira.
   He attributed occasional friction and acts of anti-Jewish
vandalism to Arab youths whipped up by events in the Middle East.
   ``Israel creates some problems for us,'' he said. ``If it were
not for Israel, we would live here as happily as ever.''
   Hai Moussa Haddad, a local Jewish jeweler, said the Arab
population is aware the Jews have unspoken emotional and religious
links with Israel, which has therefore become ``a political
embarrassment for those of us who want to remain in Tunisia, the
land of our fathers.''
   Madar attended a Talmudic school and speaks only Hebrew and
Tunisian Arabic.
   ``We must thank the authorities for all they have done for the
survival of the Jewish faith in Tunisia,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``We are regarded as an integral part of the Tunisian
people.''
   At the same time, he added, the government makes a distinction
between Jews and Zionists, those who try to promote Jewish
resettlement in Palestine.
   ``The authorities continuously remind Tunisians that a Jew is
not necessarily a Zionist,'' he said. ``Those Jews who decide to
leave are free to go anywhere. As for me, I was born here, I belong
here and I am staying here.''
   A police station is in the same building as the synagogue in
nearby Hara Ghriba. Mader said he warmly welcomed the police
presence at the synagogue, visited by hundreds of tourists daily
during the summer season.
   The 116-square-mile island is among Tunisia's main tourist
centers.
   Painted in blue outside many Jewish homes are symbolic outlines
of menorahs _ the candelabra used in Jewish rites _ combined with
fish.
   ``They are intended as a protection against the evil eye,''
Madar said. ``It is a very ancient custom. Jewish doctrine
disapproves of it, but we don't interfere.''
   Every year in May, crowds of Jews come on a pilgrimage from
Tunis and elsewhere to commemorate Rabbi Shimon Bar Yuhai, an early
Jewish mystic reputed to have had special links with Jerba.
   A marble plaque in the Ghriba synagogue claims, ``This sacred
and antique place dates from the destruction of Solomon's first
temple in 586 before our era.''
   In fact, local records indicate the whitewashed building was
erected in the 1920's, the latest in a succession of Jewish shrines
built on the same spot over the centuries.
   Former President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia attended Jewish
religious services there in 1966 to mark his respect for the
community. The Jews, Bourguiba said, brought ``baraka'' (good luck)
to Tunisia.
   Despite the official protection, vandals regularly fling garbage
over the wall into the four-acre Jewish cemetery in Hara Khebira.
Many tombstones engraved with Hebrew inscriptions were deliberately
smashed years ago.
   ``We can do nothing about it,'' Madar said. ``If we clean it up,
it will only start again.''
   The island's police chief said he had received no complaints of
anti-Jewish violence or vandalism. The police chief, who cannot be
identified by name under government regulations, said it was a
``very sensitive subject, a political rather than a police matter.''
   One Jewish resident requesting anonymity said complaints only
generate more friction.
   ``We generally live in peace here as long as we keep quiet about
those who don't like us.''
   During the 1967 Middle East war, Tunisian rioters burned down
the main synagogue in Tunis, 400 miles to the north. The
ringleaders were punished and the government paid for restoration
of the building.
   Most of Tunisia's Jews live in Tunis, but they are involved in
the capital's modern life and are ``rapidly losing their faith,''
Madar said. ``Only in Jerba is our religion intact. Jews here never
smoke or drink on the Sabbath. Their children, like mine, attend
religious schools.''
   Like many of the men in Hara Khebira, Madar was temporarily
unshaven in ritual mourning for Solomon's Temple.
   Jews enjoyed official protection throughout the five centuries
of Turkish, Spanish and French domination. When French colonial
rule ended in 1956, some 120,000 Jews lived in Tunisia. Many had
acquired French citizenship.
   Newly independent Tunisia backed the Arab cause in the Middle
East, leading to a massive exodus of the nation's Jewish minority
to Israel and France. Madar said Tunisia now has only 2,700 Jewish
residents, 900 of them in Jerba.
   Tunisian Jews are often craftsmen, tailors, butchers or
jewelers. Madar said only one has qualified as an engineer. Many
Jews are active in the tourist industry. Very few are wealthy.
   But several members of a prominent Italian Jewish family named
Pariente have elaborate tombs in the Hara Khebira cemetery. Madar
said the family contributed substantially to the upkeep of Jerba's
synagogues.
   The patriarch, Guido Pariente, died in l954. His tomb has been
desecrated and partly destroyed.
   Undisturbed nearby are the fresh tombs of Madar's mother and
father.
   As he passed, Madar knelt down in the burning sun and kissed his
parents' tombstones engraved with Hebrew inscriptions.

<HEAD>Land Reform Changing El Salvador's Countryside</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Land reform, the most radical
and expensive government project in El Salvador's history, has
benefited more than half a million people since its inception in
1980 and is radically changing the social structure of the
countryside.
   Despite major shortcomings, the program has redistributed 30
percent of the country's arable land, after compensating former
owners. The 520,000 people who have received land, either as
individuals or members of cooperatives, make up a quarter of the
country's rural poor.
   The program, however, is beset by such problems as flagging
production, tight credit, deficient administration and alleged
corruption. It is also hampered by El Salvador's guerrilla war.
   Land reform was designed, principally by U.S. officials, as a
means of undercutting the leftist guerrillas in their efforts to
win the sympathy of the rural poor.
   A dozen government and military officials, cooperativists,
peasants and international development officials interviewed said
while the toughest years of land reform are past, obstacles remain
in extending it and ensuring its smooth running.
   ``Some former landowners have not abandoned the idea of
recovering their lands and, with them, real power. They recall with
nostalgia their wealth,'' said Francisco Flores, president of the
Salvadoran Institute for Agrarian Transformation, the government
body primarily responsible for land reform.
   But he added that the vast majority of the former owners have
accepted compensation, and that title to the property has been
legally transferred.
   The process has cost almost $300 million, most of it provided by
the United States.
   Agrarian reform is enshrined in the 1983 constitution, which
would have to be scrapped if big holdings were to again be
concentrated in few hands.
   Some left-of-center cooperativists and officials of the
governing Christian Democratic Party are concerned that the right
wing, which won control of the legislature in March elections,
might try to undo some of the reform.
   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena, is
considered in a good position to challenge the Christian Democrats
in presidential elections scheduled for March.
   Orlando Arevalo, director of the National Finance Entity for
Agricultural Lands, said a marked increase has been noted in
expulsions of land reform beneficiaries in recent months. He blames
former owners emboldened by Arena's legislative victory and
prospects for gaining the presidency next year.
   ``Most landholders are licensed to carry arms,'' Arevalo said.
``The former owners, who have always opposed the reform, are now
encouraged and are fighting the campesinos politically, juridically
and by force.''
   But he said virtually all of the 500 or so recent expulsions
were from small holdings and represent a tiny percentage of the
reformed sector. He said the government is resorting to the courts
and the military to get the small farmers reinstated.
   He noted, however, that the judiciary has been dominated for
decades by the rightwingers who might favor the landowners.
   Phase I of land reform expropriated all holdings over 1,235
acres, involving 477 properties owned by 262 families. A subsequent
Land-to-the-Tiller law affected small holdings and benefited about
45,000 families.
   The Phase I lands were converted into 329 cooperatives, 25 of
which have been abandoned because they are in war zones. About
30,000 families live and work on the 304 Phase I cooperatives.
   According to Flores and international development officials
working with the reform, a third of the cooperatives are able to
finance operations, pay debts and dividends to their members.
   Another third are described as bankrupt ``basket cases'' that
cannot succeed in their current structure.
   The remaining third are described as borderline.
   Arena's platform calls for the dismantling of all but the most
successful cooperatives, dividing the unsuccessful and borderline
ventures into parcels that would be transferred by title to the
farmers working them. The party contends that only by converting El
Salvador into ``a country of property owners'' will there be
sufficient incentive and initiative to spur production.
   The Christian Democrats, after seeing many millions of dollars
lost, have already begun dividing up the failed cooperatives into
family plots.
   ``The political decision is to divide,'' said Flores.
   One divided venture is the 2,100-acre La Normandia Cooperative
Usulutan province 65 miles southeast of San Salvador. Before being
expropriated from Dona Maria de Dalton in 1980, it produced cotton
for export, with small sections dedicated to the corn and beans
consumed by the peasants who worked it.
   Two months into this year's growning season, with abundant rains
after two years of drought, it is a green sea of thigh-high corn
divided in 8.5-acre plots. It is home for 170 families who live in
mud-brick tile-roofed houses with wells but without running water
or electricity. It has a school but no clinic.
   A mile into the fields along an oxen-trod path, Marcial Lopez
worked with his wife Maria and two of their eight children, tending
tomato plants along the edge of their plot, most of which was sown
with corn.
   Lopez talked of his years in the land-reform program.
   ``From '80 to '86 we had credit from the government and we
planted cotton. But we only showed losses. Those who are up in arms
(the guerrillas) would attack each year right before we were going
to spray, and destroy or damage the plants. Without pesticide, the
crop was always bad,'' he said.
   Part of the guerrillas' strategy is to sabotage of the national
economy, which is heavily dependent on exports of coffee, sugar and
cotton.
   The cooperative decided last year to divide the land into family
plots, leaving some fallow and some to be rented or parceled out to
eventual new beneficiaries of the agricultural reform.
   Asked if he'd prefer to continue working as part of a
cooperative or have title to his plot, Lopez responded: ``Both ways
are good. Individually, if we have financing, we would probably
make the land produce more. But the cooperative could also produce
good results under better conditions, and it would provide more
work for more people.''
   The cooperative is considered one of the ``basket-cases.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For a nation with its illustrious seagoing past,
the United States has let its merchant marine nearly sink out of
sight. Only one in four graduates of the seven merchant marine
academies find a berth on an American vessel these days. That seems
a waste of hard training, some say, and raises another question:
What if another big war or other emergency should suddenly require
Uncle Sam to find his sea legs again?

   If, without donning scuba gear, you would find out how deep the
U.S. merchant marine has sunk into oblivion, consider this:
   The actual love boat on TV's ``Love Boat'' is Norwegian.
   Why, then, are one federal and six state maritime academies in
the United States still in business when the nation's merchant
ships are barely afloat? Are these young sailors training to man a
Titanic?
   Good question, difficult answer.
   In business the schools are, albeit with trimmed sails. They
turn out some 725 graduates a year, only a minority of whom will
actually fill a berth at sea. The rest, like their recent
predecessors, will find places with port authorities, shipping and
stevedoring firms, the Navy, tugboats, ship designers, marinas,
yacht yards, an admiralty law office or two. One is relief captain
of the Mississippi excursion stern-wheeler Delta Queen. A few are
weathermen.
   ``The last stand of the U.S. merchant marine is in these
academies,'' says Frank Braynard, museum curator of the U.S.
Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point on New York's Long Island.
   A last stand George Custer could commiserate with.
   In 1986, goods worth $320.5 billion entered or left the United
States by sea. Only 4 percent of it was in American bottoms. While
90-plus percent of the Earth's trade moves by sea in some 25,000
ships, the U.S. merchant fleet numbered just 371 active oceangoing
vessels, 11th worldwide. (Panama was first with 3,278 ships, Russia
second with 2,453.) The last ocean merchant ship built in a U.S.
yard, 76 of which have closed since 1980, was launched last year.
None is currently building. None is on order.
   A presidential commission on the merchant marine and defense
headed by former U.S. Sen. Jeremiah Denton of Alabama predicted
last December that unless actions are taken the number of ships and
seamen will drop by one-half by the year 2000. Rear Adm. Kenneth M.
Curtis, president of the Maine Maritime Academy in Castine, cites a
Navy estimate of a shortage of 8,100 trained seamen in the military
Sea Lift Command alone.
   To keep that shortfall from getting worse is one reason the
academies survive. The United States has about 100 ships mothballed
that could be commissioned in five to 10 days in a national
emergency. But you can't mothball crews to man them.
   But should there be World War III and should it be fought as the
first two, some see the maritime weakness of the United States as
the possible Achilles heel.
   ``Our merchant fleet bears the heavy onus of being the first of
our heavy industries exported overseas,'' says Rear Adm. Paul L.
Krinsky, superintendent of Kings Point. ``But we're not static.
Buggy whip manufacturers went broke because they thought they were
in the buggy whip business instead of transportation.'' Americans
are once again pioneering, this time in ``intermodalism,'' the fine
art of combining and coordinating road, rail and air freight for
sea transport or vice versa.
   Thirty years ago, half of America's seamen came up ``the
hawsepipe.'' The only requirement for promotion was to pass
successive Coast Guard exams at minimum three-year intervals on the
ladder from seaman to mate to captain or chief engineer. Today, 17
percent of licensed officers are graduates of Kings Point alone.
   The first academy for commercial mariners dates back a century.
The progenitor was Adm. Stephen B. Luce, a graduate of the U.S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis where merchant sailors have been mildly
deprecated as ``the black shoe navy.'' Luce proposed that coastal
cities set up facilities to train sailors.
   In 1874, New York City acquired the old sloop-of-war St. Mary
for use as a floating school. She was succeeded by the armed
frigate Newport which was towed around the harbor with faculty and
students to wherever the cheapest berth could be found.
   In the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a former naval
person, eyed Fort Schuyler at the Bronx entrance to the East River
as a site for a permanent land school. The fort, which had never
fired a shot and whose only scar was a bar sawed out by a prisoner
escaping from the brig, was also eyed by New York's
road-park-bridge visionary, Robert Moses.
   ``It would make a fine park,'' said Moses.
   ``A fine school,'' said the president. So the New York Maritime
Academy moved in among the cannons and abides, now a part of the
State University of New York and named SUNY Maritime College.
   Meanwhile, Roosevelt saw the need for a federal counterpart, a
complement to Annapolis, West Point and the Coast Guard Academy.
The U.S. merchant marine had been embarrassed in 1934 by the
burning of the Morro Castle off the New Jersey coast, which took
125 lives. Some officers abandoned ship before the passengers. Fire
hoses didn't fit. Professionalism was needed. And there was war in
the air. To Roosevelt, the merchant marine was the fourth arm of
the military.
   The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 thereupon created a national
maritime academy. Two years later the first corps assembled. Coast
Guard bases and even Fort Schuyler were used until a permanent home
was found in Walter Chrysler's former summer home at Kings Point on
Long Island, across the Sound from Fort Schuyler.
   In 1948, Kings Point went to a four-year bachelor of science
program. Today students take courses to be deck officers or
engineers with additional training in management, logistics, some
humanities _ and swimming, a requirement. They are appointed by
congressmen, as at other service academies. In exchange for a free
education they must maintain a mariner's license for 10 years,
serve in the Naval Reserve for eight and work in the maritime
industry ashore or at sea.

   Of this June's 213 graduates (17 of whom were women, eight of
those engineers), 28 entered the military, about the recent
average. Thirty percent of the class of '87 found slots at sea, 45
percent jobs ashore, 20 percent joined the military and 5 percent
went on to graduate school. All students receive a year's training
aboard a U.S. flag merchantman.
   SUNY Maritime College, on the other hand, sends its 750 students
out for two months every summer aboard the Empire State, the former
passenger liner President Jackson. They do everything from
navigating to running the engines to chipping paint.
   ``The advantage of our system over Kings Point is that our
students run the ship under supervision. They are at the mercy of
whatever captain they serve under as to how much they are taught,''
says Dr. William Porter, the academy's vice president.
   SUNY grads must also be able to tie 21 knots, which most put off
learning until the last minute, unaware that a horney-handed bos'n
will time them with a stopwatch. They have to swim, too.
   ``Our kids have more flexibility than Kings Point,'' says Bob
Hogg, SUNY director for community affairs. ``Kings Pointers have
their service commitment. Ours in dry times can go to places like
Consolidated Edison if they are engineers. A marine architect can
go into an architectural firm. We can also take older students,
foreigners and those who can't pass the Kings Point physical.''
   With the prevalence of union requirements, it is a rare tar
these days who becomes an officer up the hawsepipe. ``And probably
only a foolhardy one even tries,'' says Porter.
   ``Few seek out the academies because of the romance of the
sea,'' says Krinsky. Quickly loaded containers have done away with
languorous or lascivious days in port. Students come for technical
training or because friends or family had.
   ``They are middle-class, achievement-oriented kids who have been
encouraged by parents and teachers,'' Krinsky says. ``Their SATs
aren't Harvard-Yale, but their achievement is comparable after
graduation.'' Kings Point alumni are a who's who of leaders in the
maritime world.
   ``Kings Point's focus is more narrow than ours,'' says Hogg,
whose school offers so many courses that students, uniformed as are
those at Kings Point and other academies, can't march to class.
``They are training future officers. Ours get that training, plus.''
   Twenty-five years out, just over half of the Kings Point grads
are still in the maritime field, a slightly better record than the
other service academies. Sixty percent of the Fort Schuyler
graduates go into the maritime business and the rest into allied
occupations. One, Gary Jobson, was tactician on an America's Cup
defender. Fort Schuyler has benefited handsomely by being official
sponsor of several Cup yachts which it gets to sell when the races
are over.
   Besides the school in Maine, there are maritime academies in
Massachusetts, Texas, California and Michigan, all state-run. ``And
all of them,'' says Porter, ``are concerned with dwindling
enrollments.''
   A forthright commencement speaker at any of the academies would
warn that the sea, American-style, is not an encouraging field.
There are billets for only 4,116 deck and engineering officers on
U.S. flag vessels.
   ``In 1980, 80 percent of the graduates of maritime academies
found shipboard positions,'' says Eugene Rose, president of
Seatrain Lines. ``This number was reduced to about 25 percent last
year.''
   To share the work available, unions rotate jobs so that some
mariners are at sea only four months a year.
   For years, neglect, vacillating policies, greed and crime have
beset the U.S. merchant fleet. Dockside theft was so bad in New
York one shoe company sent the lefts in one shipment and the rights
in another to frustrate two-legged looters.
   The unions, once a favorite whipping boy to blame for the high
costs of U.S. shipping, ``are ready for an agreement with anyone,''
says Braynard. ``It's very hard to say they are to blame. When they
were riding high, they rode high. But they were no more lousy when
they had power than the shipowners when they did. It's a human
nature situation.''
   Human nature, however, has not launched ships since Helen of
Troy. Economics does. And military need. Here again it's an Alice
in Wonderland world. The United States does have a respectable
container fleet. But you can't fit a tank in a box. Container ships
need dockside cranes. You don't find those on invasion beaches.
   To qualify for the $250 million in operating subsidies Uncle Sam
pays American shipping a year, the ships must be built in American
yards. But, as the Denton commission noted, American yards are a
highly endangered species, even for military vessels. A South
Korean yard can build a ship for a third of what an American yard
would charge. Several years ago Congress recognized this by
``opening a window'' to let U.S. companies build overseas. Then it
closed the window. At the same time, U.S. carriers are required to
replace their fleets periodically in order to qualify for subsidies.
   In such logical whirlpools the American merchant marine spins
rudderless, to some observers.
   ``I don't think we can be totally dependent on the rest of the
world,'' says Krinsky. ``Who would ever say, let foreign airlines
on our domestic routes? Or foreign railroads? But shipping..?''
   In step with Reaganomics, Kings Point has cut back enrollment 25
percent over the last five years. If the merchant marine were
simply a commercial industry, this might be a resigned
acknowledgement of the practicalities. If, on the other hand, the
merchant marine is indeed an arm of the military, shouldn't this be
as alarming as the scuttling of every fourth aircraft carrier? To
the staffs of the maritime academies, it is.

   The decline of the U.S. merchant marine seems all the more
notable in a nation with an illustrious seagoing past.
   In its birth and infancy, America was basically an island. You
had to take a boat to get there. Ships were the highways of the
Colonies.
   Seamen, still boys, ``came up the hawsepipe'' to learn before
the mast. Nathaniel Bowditch, the great navigator, got his start
selling pulleys and marlin spikes as a young ship chandler until he
learned enough ropes to go to sea. Young lads from Nantucket and
New Bedford shipped out on whalers across the globe, came home
after years and signed on again as mates.
   Whalers lit the lamps of a young nation. Slavers in their vile
trade populated the cotton fields. Ship-borne immigrants populated
the whole country. Fast American-designed clippers from Baltimore
and New England out-sped the world around the Horn in the China
trade.
   John Fitch drove the first practicable steamboat on the Delaware
River in 1789, 20 years before Robert Fulton. (Fitch also
demonstrated he was ahead of his time by dying of a morphine
overdose.) In 1806 Frederic Tudor displayed Yankee maritime
ingenuity by eschewing Harvard as ``a place for loafers like all
colleges'' and exporting around the world what wintry New England
had plenty of: ice.
   The tide began turning in the 1840s when Britain subsidized the
new Cunard Line on the North Atlantic run. In 1847 Congress
followed suit by subsidizing building ships for the Bremen Line,
jointly owned by Americans and the city-state of Bremen. Carrying
the flag became national policy and pride. In America, shippers
were thus over the years alternately lulled and starved by
congressional and presidential whim with the purse strings.
   The real deep-six was epitomized by the man Frank Braynard,
curator of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y.,
calls ``that wretch, Horace Greeley,'' when he advised America's
young men to go West. They did, ironically in prairie schooners. A
nation turned its back on its ocean heritage.
   ``The seaman changed from the town hero to the local drifter,''
says Braynard, a steam-fired advocate of a return to maritime
greatness. ``The need for labor in the Unitred States was so great
any loose men were drawn to jobs in the heartland.'' Never again
would an increasingly rich America be able to match the low wages,
often heavily subsidized, of foreign merchantmen. The glory days
were largely done.
   In the century after the Civil War, the United States built only
10 liners for the lucrative North Atlantic passenger business.
   Not that know-how didn't exist. In World War II, the United
States built 6,000 ships, a third of the world's merchant fleet, to
defeat Germany and Japan. Using assembly line techniques, a
California yard built a 10,000-ton Liberty Ship in just over three
days. But at the end of the war the United States, which by then
had almost half of the world's tonnage, gave away much of its fleet
to its stricken allies, a nice thing to do, particularly for some
wily Greeks with names like Onassis and Niarchos.
   The Yanks did not lose their ingenuity. Malcolm McLean started
the container ship revolution with the bright idea of putting truck
trailers on the unused deck space of a coastal tanker. Americans
invented the ship that loads and unloads itself with its own
lighters.
   ``Then the whole world zapped us with our own ideas,'' says
Braynard, his exasperation at full ahead.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ She's a human jukebox, an anonymous disc jockey
spinning ancient records and piping the music to a handful of
Pittsburgh bars via an antiquated telephone system her father
invented 60 years ago. Helen Reutzel is one of the other folks, a
woman who enjoys neither fortune nor fame, but she loves what she's
doing for sentimental reasons.

   Drop two bits into an old-fashioned, mahogany
jukebox in a Pittsburgh tavern, and Helen Reutzel will spin a
memory in the form of a song.
   It's a jukebox with a twist _ a human jukebox with a collection
of more than 100,000 records dating back to the 1920s and an
assortment of customers who would never plunk a quarter into cheap,
mechanical imitations.
   ``If you want to hear `Squaws Along The Yukon' or head-banging
music, you can. Helen has everything,'' says Dan Casagrande, 39,
owner of Brandy's Restaurant, which has had Mrs. Reutzel's
``telephone music'' for 10 years.
   ``You can come in here depressed, and you hear these songs and
all of a sudden it really does boost you up,'' says Nancy Delaney,
54, of Pittsburgh, as she stirs a drink at Brandy's bar. ``I hope
this woman is a millionaire because she deserves to be. If she only
realized the pleasure she brings to people.''
   Pick up a black phone on top of the jukebox, and a raspy voice
at a studio across town cheerily asks your preference.
   Not sure of the title? No problem. Hum a few bars and chances
are Mrs. Reutzel knows it.
   Afraid the song is a little dated or obscure? For an extra $1,
she'll head to the attic and blow the dust off the less-popular
tunes.
   Want to personalize the song? An additional 50 cents buys a
dedication.
   ``Attention, your attention, please,'' Mrs. Reutzel broadcasts
into one of the five bars she services. ``This next song is a
special dedication to Scott from Arizona. We hope you get lucky
tonight, Scott.''
   How it all works is not quite clear to Mrs. Reutzel. Her father
devised the system about 60 years ago by using old radio tubes and
copper telephone lines. When he died 12 years ago, the secret of
telephone music went with him, and his daughter claims no one has
been able to duplicate it.
   Songs are played over telephone lines from a studio on the
city's North Side to speakers in the bars around the city.
   ``Studio,'' though, may be too grand a word. It's actually a
second-floor walk-up hidden _ because of the extensive record
collection _ in a boarded-up brick building approached from a dimly
lit courtyard off a back alley.
   The linoleum is worn, the walls need a fresh coat of paint, and
any unusable space is covered with papers, ashtrays or coffee cups.
Row after row of records line the perimeter of the small room, and
opposite a switchboard are three tiers of turntables.
   ``Everybody has a wild fantasy of what the place looks like. It
can be anything they want,'' says Mrs. Reutzel, a salty woman who
calls everyone ``babe'' or ``honey.'' ``They imagine me as a
27-year-old blonde or whatever. They think we're beautiful and
sexy.''
   Although Mrs. Reutzel won't give her age, she was slightly
miffed when a local columnist said her ``salad days are wilted.''
   Upon hearing a shrill ``ping-ping'' sound, which signals two
quarters being deposited in a jukebox, Mrs. Reutzel plugs a wire
into the switchboard and picks up her handset.
   ``Telephone music. What do you want to hear, hon?''
   No one answers.
   ``Number please. This is your jukebox talking. I can hear you
laughing...What were you doing?...You lost a quarter under the
machine,'' she says, chuckling. ``Don't do that, if you move it and
it don't play, I'll be on your you-know-what. Go ahead, honey, I'll
give it to you. Don't worry about it. We'll leave it for the
sweeper.''
   The caller requests ``Teach Me Tonight'' by the DeCastro
sisters, one of several irreplaceable records held together by duct
tape. Other records, especially the old 78s, are so warped coins
have to be placed on the arm of the turntable so the needle doesn't
skip.

   Although the quality of the recordings isn't first-rate, a corps
of regular telephone music customers would rather have a scratchy
song than none at all.
   ``On most of the cracked records we have `Watch, sticks,' so we
can monitor it and catch it,'' Mrs. Reutzel says with a throaty
laugh. ``But sometimes if you're real busy and don't pay attention
and it's going, `clunk, clunk, clunk,' the bartenders will call up
and say, `You're playing our song again.' ''
   Decades ago _ Mrs. Reutzel isn't sure how many _ her father
owned several studios and had 120 jukeboxes distributed in bars
around the country. But telephone music waned with the popularity
of radio and home stereo systems and, little by little, the slick,
handmade jukeboxes were put into storage.
   When her father died, Mrs. Reutzel took over the business for
sentimental more than monetary reasons. Bar owners get 40 percent
of each quarter dropped into their jukebox and Mrs. Reutzel gets 60
percent. With only five jukeboxes out, the trickle of quarters
isn't enough to pay the volunteers who help her on weekends.
   ``I inherited it from my father and I didn't know what to do,''
she says. ``It was his baby, his dream,'' she says.
   Dream analysis is her true love, and she'd rather devote more
time giving classes than spinning records. But she says she keeps
hanging on ``like a rat terrier,'' even though there have been
times she's been unable to pay her bills.
   ``It's a love thing with the people on the jukebox,'' she says.
``People will call up that haven't been in town for years and tell
me what they're doing. One guy came on and said, `Do you remember
me?' He said, `There isn't a day that goes by I don't think of you
and this jukebox and what all it meant to me.' ''
   ``I would hate to see it go, plain and simple,'' says
Casagrande, who has a group of customers who conduct impromptu
sing-alongs with the help of the jukebox every Friday night.
   ``It's not the money. We make more on a couple of drinks than on
the jukebox,'' he says. ``It's just the fact that it's part of the
entertainment. People come here with that in mind, to hang around
the jukebox.''
   Mrs. Reutzel is also more than a source of music. Her contagious
laughter and easygoing banter can shake the blues for many a lonely
customer, like the time she dedicated the song ``Looking For Love
In All The Wrong Places'' to a downhearted patron who lost his
girlfriend to another man and wanted to hear ``Your Cheating
Heart'' a dozen times.
   ``We're psychiatrists, psychologists, girlfriends. It's not just
a record. It's that one-on-one conversation,'' she says.
   ``Most people in bars are lonely. They're sitting there and
nobody's talking to them. So they go up and they put a buck in the
jukebox and turn around and say, `What do you want to hear?'
Everybody looks and says, `Hey, baby, I'll take this.' It's a way
of making friends because music is a common denominator.''
   Music is also a way to reminisce through that special song that
tugs at romantics' hearts or makes an old man tap his toes.
   ``How many people can be instantly gratified for whatever moment
they want?'' Mrs. Reutzel asks. ``When you have over 100,000
selections, you can reach everyone.''
   Mrs. Reutzel doesn't profess to having favorites, but there is
one tune that breathes life into the distant past. When the
requests slow down and she's feeling nostalgic, she plays a song
her father recorded decades ago as a member of the Steel City Four,
a barbershop quartet.
   It's a special song for many reasons. Mrs. Reutzel was raised by
her mother but always longed to be closer to her father, and
hearing his voice among the thousands of records he collected over
the years helps keep the bonds alive.
   ``I was only in my dad's life for holidays,'' she explains while
positioning the record on the turntable. ``That hunger was always
there to be with my dad, and when I finally got here, he's dead.''
   The record is scratchy and worn, and it's hard to make out all
the words or hear each voice, but it's pure music to Mrs. Reutzel.
   ``Do you hear it?'' she says, her face lighting up. ``That's my
dad. That's him.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They called him the ``Brown Condor of

   Tom Simmons's love of flying is fundamental. He
learned to fly at 16. Owns a biplane. Flies at air shows.
   ``Most people who love the sky can't be as happy on the ground
as other people,'' he says, as if stating an obvious truth.
   But even he did not suspect that simple curiosity about a fellow
pilot long dead could turn into an obsession that would consume his
life for 10 years until he could search out and write down every
detail he could discover about a remarkable American named John
Charles Robinson.
   ``The man became important to me,'' says Simmons.
   ``He was from my hometown, Gulfport, from my Mississippi, from
my South, and he belongs to the United States as a true hero. I
wanted everyone to know about him.
   ``I once told someone that when I finally finished the book and
had gotten it published maybe his spirit would leave me alone.''
   Simmons's book, ``The Brown Condor: The True Adventures of John
C. Robinson,'' was published recently by Bartleby Press. Whether
John Robinson's spirit now lets him go remains to be seen. Simmons
still does not seem to tire of talking about Robinson or about how
he managed to find all that rich detail about his extraordinary
life.
   It turns out that John Robinson, against improbable odds, not
only became an accomplished pilot and instructor in the 1920s but
also trained a small cadre of pilots for Ethiopia when that country
was invaded by Italy as a prelude to World War II. He became
Emperor Haile Selassie's personal pilot and consultant and later
helped establish an Ethiopian airline.
   A small item in the 75th anniversary edition of the Biloxi,
Miss., Sun-Herald was what set Tom Simmons on his 10-year quest.
   It was a line from an old 1930s book, a WPA book, called ``A
Walking Tour of Gulfport,'' and it said:
   ``If you cross the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad you will come
to the Big Quarter and at 30th Avenue see the home of the pilot
Johnny Robinson, the Brown Condor of Ethiopia.''
   Simmons, a native of Gulfport, knew its history, knew the Big
Quarter was the old black section of West Gulfport. He also knew
his aviation history.
   ``I said to myself, are they trying to tell me a black man from
Gulfport could get a pilot's license back in those days?
Impossible. Aviation was one area where blacks were thoroughly
excluded. That was just a fact.
   ``But if it were true, I figured I might have a little article
for one of the flying magazines I contributed to.''
   He knew an elderly woman, Miomi Godine, who was black and also a
Gulfport native. He asked her if she had ever heard of John
Robinson.
   ``She said, `Why, yes, I knew him. He used to walk me to Sunday
school.' She also told me that, yes, he had been a pilot, had died
as a result of an accident on a rescue mission in Ethiopia in 1954
_ and that his sister lived in New York City, Mrs. Bertha Stokes.''
   Mrs. Godine's memory was clear, and her recollections stirred
Simmons's curiosity all the more. It was worth a trip to New York
to confirm the improbability of what he was hearing.
   It was after his visit with Mrs. Stokes that curiosity became
obsession.
   Back in Mississippi, Simmons installed himself in the Sun-Herald
library and read every page of every paper from most of 1934
through 1936. It produced a few incidents, leads.
   He found old clippings at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama where
Robinson had learned automotive mechanics in 1924.
   He found Robinson's footprints in Chicago where he had landed a
job at a Curtis-Wright flying school sweeping out classrooms while
class was in progress, and listening, and where Robinson and
another black mechanic, Cornelius Coffey, had built their own
airplane using a motorcycle engine.
   He found Cornelius Coffey.
   He found a photo of Robinson at the Air and Space Museum in
Washington but they knew nothing more about him. On that trip,
though, Simmons met Curtis Graves.
   ``Curtis worked for NASA. He grew up in Mississippi, and, being
black, he was able to interview people who might have been leery
about my motives. Pretty soon Curtis was caught up in the project
as much as I was.''
   The search for John Robinson apparently had that effect on
everyone snagged in Simmons's net.
   ``Every time I thought, well, this is all I'm going to get,'' he
says, ``another door would open, which in turn led to another door,
and so on.''
   Once, announcing an air show in Meridian, Miss., in honor of
pioneering pilot Al Key, Simmons turned to the honoree and said,
``By the way, Al, did you ever hear of a John Robinson back in the
old days?''
   Key became a wellspring of anecdotes about Robinson. So it went.
   ``It was easy to become fascinated by Robinson, especially for a
Southerner, especially for black Southerners. They knew how the
system worked back then and what it took to lick it, as Robinson
had.
   ``It was purely because of Robinson's accomplishments that
Tuskegee was included in the Army's program to train pilots for
World War II _ black pilots. He knocked down that barrier.
   ``I suppose I grew to love the man, in the sense that even
though I'm white I could identify with some of the struggles he
went through. I understood his having to go to another continent to
get his opportunity to excel.''
   Not long ago, Fred Gregory, a space shuttle pilot, who is black,
visited Mississippi. Simmons met him _ and gave him a ride in a
biplane, something the astronaut had never flown in.
   ``The trail in aviation leads from John Robinson to Fred
Gregory. John Robinson was the spark.
   ``I guess I got caught up in that notion and couldn't let it
go.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Change seems to be the rule in our fluid, mobile
society, but stepping from one way of life into another seems to
follow an unchanging pattern, distinct phases, whether the actual
departure is abrupt or not. And ``role exit,'' as one scholar calls
it, is seldom easy.

   Whether you've become an ex-wife, ex-junkie,
ex-surgeon, ex-hooker or ex-nun, you go through the same
psychological process in moving from one role to another, according
to a Texas sociologist, herself an ex-nun, now married and the
mother of two.
   Dr. Helen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh, Sister Helen Rose for 11 years, has
called this process ``role exit'' and her dream is not that her
book, ``Becoming an Ex,'' becomes a best seller, but that the
concept of ``role exit'' finds its way into introductory psychology
texts.
   She says she did not coin the phrase, but she was the first to
research it through interviews with 185 persons and discover the
similarities and the stages people go through as they leave one
role in life and move to another.
   Her own ``role exit'' was a happy one.
   ``I thoroughly enjoyed my life as a nun,'' she says. ``I grew up
in a small Catholic, German community in Olfen, Texas, where at 18
women had the choice of getting married or joining the convent. The
nuns were unwitting feminists back then in that they were the only
educated role models we had,'' she says. ``Education was important
to me.''
   She taught the fourth grade and later at Our Lady of the Lake
University in San Antonio while she worked on her master's degree
at the University of Texas. She then went to Columbia University to
win her doctorate. It was then that she began the first stage of
role exit, the doubting. She wondered whether the religious life
was for her. She felt a strong desire to be married and have
children.
   She soon met her husband-to-be, a psychiatrist, who was going
through a divorce, and a doctor friend was wrestling with whether
he really wanted to be a doctor.
   She noticed that all three of them were experiencing similar
emotions as they moved from one role to another. Her research
verified that the similarities are strong, even when the exit is
traumatic, even when a mother chooses to give up custody of her
children in order to get out of a terrible marriage.
   Ebaugh also realized that in today's society, with a high
divorce rate, high mobility, and second careers, role exiting had a
much broader reach than it did back when marriages were for life
and people usually retired with a gold watch in the city in which
they were born.
   After the first doubts, where people may become frustrated,
burned out, or just realize their unhappiness, comes what she calls
the unconscious cueing stage. A prostitute she interviewed allowed
herself to get pregnant and then left her business because she did
not wish her child to suffer the stigma of a mother in the world's
oldest profession.
   A young mental health worker, whose Cadillac kept breaking down,
replaced it with a truck. He explained it was for hauling dogs and
camping. He owned no dogs and did not camp. In retrospect, he says
that he always thought he might want to go into the construction
business, which he eventually did.
   In the convent, subconscious cueing was often spotted in
hairstyles. Those nuns who allowed their hair to grow longer and
styled it more fashionably were those getting ready to role exit.
   In the second stage, people seek alternatives, sometimes
tangibly and sometimes in their imaginations. Married people may
agree to a temporary separation. Business people may take a leave
of absence.
   Third is the action stage, the departure. Ebaugh found that 20
percent of the exiters went through a gradual, evolutionary
process. The vast majority experienced an identifiable turning
point.
   Sometimes it was emotional, as a spouse's overwhelming feeling
that ending the marriage at once was the only way to preserve
sanity. A Protestant minister, discontended with life in a fish
bowl, hearing criticism if he had a social cocktail and also if he
didn't, decided to look for other work after hearing a woman
describe him as ``unprofessional.''
   A CIA employee whose job entailed much travel resigned when his
wife left him, deciding he needed to stay at home to raise his son
properly.
   But there are many people, Ebaugh says, ``for whom that critical
event doesn't occur and who remain entrapped in roles they don't
like.''
   The fourth stage is creating a new identity.
   ``It is important to incorporate your old role into your new
identity,'' says Ebaugh, ``and to keep a few mementos or
photographs. Eventually, even if it was a traumatic exit, it is
good to have these things to look at when they are not so
emotion-charged.''
   ``It is important to maintain contact with some people in the
old role, to keep some bridges,'' she says. ``You don't want to
totally close the door to the past, because a hangover identity
will be there. It's also important to be able to talk to someone
about who one used to be.''
   Many of the interviewees reported the worst part was a sense of
being in a ``vacuum'' when they switched roles. Divorcees, for
instance, weren't married but didn't quite feel single.
   Mothers who gave up custody had the hardest time.
   ``Most of these women were unable to support themselves, much
less their children, at the time of the divorce and so they gave up
custody for the sake of the children,'' she says.
   Then, after a few years, when the woman has put her life back
together, either through remarriage or work, they find they can
support the children and try and get them back.
   ``Judges don't usually reverse custody,'' says Ebaugh ``and
these women are still mothers, but without their children.''
   Ebaugh also writes about the problems of disclosing the past,
particularly when the role exit was positive, such as becoming an
ex-convict or a recovering alcoholic. The problem is that the label
may persist.
   Dr. Ebaugh limited her research to people who made voluntary
exits, not people who suddenly lost jobs.
   ``I suspect they go through the same stages, but the timing is
probably different,'' she says.
   Recently Ebaugh, now 46, attended what would have been her 25th
anniversary had she stayed in the convent.
   ``It was a wonderful kind of closure for me,'' she says. ``I
also realized it was a wonderful experience.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Is a child who is hard of hearing more likely to
become a criminal later in life? Studies in the nation's prisons
suggest there is a link. Thomas Crowe of the University of
Mississippi is one researcher who believes that dealing with
hearing disorders in young children may help reduce crime.

   Noting an unusually high percentage of
prisoners who are hard of hearing _ almost half in Mississippi _
some researchers suspect the disorder may contribute to criminal
behavior.
   ``My working hypothesis is that hearing loss may be the first
link in a chain of events or circumstances that eventually lead to
a life of crime,'' says Thomas Crowe, chairman of the University of
Mississippi Department of Communicative Disorders.
   Crowe found that 48.5 percent of the inmates at the Mississippi
State Penitentiary at Parchman suffer some kind of hearing disorder
compared with only 7 percent among the general public. The
statistics are even more startling because the 7 percent represents
the entire general population from infants to the elderly. However,
the average age of the prison population is 25, and the younger age
group should have a lower percentage of hearing disorders.
   Other researchers have had similar findings. An Ohio State
Penitentiary study in 1970 indicated 40 percent of the inmates had
hearing disorders, a 1986 study in Wisconsin cited 36 percent and a
1979 study in Virginia 17 percent.
   The ultimate question, Crowe says, is: ``What impact has the
hearing loss had on that person's life? Has that hearing loss in
any way contributed, directly or indirectly, to the person's
criminal behavior and how do you determine that?''
   Crowe's research team, which includes an audiologist,
psychologist, psychiatrist, medical doctor and linguist, is now
applying to the U.S. Justice Department for a grant for a
five-year, follow-up study.
   The second study will determine the severity, nature and causes
of inmates' hearing disorders. He said the amount of the request
has yet to be worked out.
   Corrections officials as well as audiologists and speech
pathologists nationwide are concerned about the high level of
hearing disorders among prison populations, says Jo Williams,
manager of audiology and technical assistance for the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association in Rockville, Md. The
56,000-member organization is the largest association of
audiologists and speech and language pathologists in the nation.
   The association called for more research in the field after a
task force's cursory look at the problem in 1984.
   The task force cited a nationwide survey of about 200 state and
federal corrections administrators which indicated 77 percent of
those polled believe the psychological and communication problems
stemming from hearing disorders lead to criminal behavior.
   Crowe says he has found only a few dozen studies conducted in
the past 40 years on any aspect of prisoners' hearing and speech
disorders. Of the few studies available, he says, almost all have
merely documented the prevalence of problems.
   If the hearing disorder is congenital or occurred early in the
inmate's life, Crowe says, it's likely the handicap helped shape a
criminal personality.
   Crowe's initial research in 1985 didn't indicate the exact
nature, severity, or causes of the hearing disorders because there
wasn't enough money for detailed hearing tests or medical
evaluations.
   The initial study involved merely testing each Parchman inmate's
hearing at different frequencies and comparing that to a normal
person's hearing range.
   Crowe compares the initial auditory screening test to a simple
eye chart used by an opthalmologist. The doctor knows the patient
can't see the letters at a certain size, but more tests are needed
for a diagnosis of the problem.
   There could be many causes for the hearing disorders, Crowe
says, including heredity and loud noises as well as lack of medical
attention to ear infections or other problems in childhood.
   Even relatively minor hearing losses could damage a child's
personality development, Crowe says. Many children with undetected
hearing disorders grow up without ever knowing they're physically
different from their peers. However, they must deal with
considerably more stress and disorientation.
   ``It may sound like mumbling,'' Crowe says. ``It would be like
you trying to interact with someone with a very heavy foreign
accent. If you have to listen to them for a long time, it will tire
you out. You have to channel and focus your attention to
comprehend.''
   The strain may make the child irritable, and he may appear to
have an extremely short attention span.
   Some children with undetected hearing losses may grow up able to
capture words, but the emotions attached to the words escape them,
Crowe says.
   ``Consider a preschool child who has a hearing loss. Not a real
terrible hearing loss. The child learns to talk, but it is severe
enough that the child has trouble hearing the meaning of things,''
Crowe says.
   ``Not only do you hear what is said. But you hear how it's said.
You hear inflections, things like that. You can read my moods and
emotions.''
   An inability to follow the emotional trains of thought of others
could trigger all kinds of anti-social tendencies, Crowe says. Add
the emotional and intellectual handicaps from a hearing disorder to
the underprivileged status of many children and you get a prime
candidate for prison, he says.
   ``If that scenario is sometimes correct, theoretically we can
sometimes prevent crime by dealing with hearing problems and
language problems at a preschool age,'' he says.
   Some preschool programs such as Head Start do some hearing
screening, but many children don't have hearing tests until
kindergarten or much later _ after personality traits are long
entrenched.
   ``I didn't have my first hearing test until I got back from
Vietnam,'' Crowe says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It runs on a staff of two, with a slender yearly

   It's a small step in a quarrelsome world, but
Judy and Cassandra became best friends again after a bitter falling
out over a ruined stereo speaker.
   Chalk one up for the 10th-grader who mediated and the Mackenzie
High School's Conflict Mediation Center _ in turn an offshoot of
the more formidably named Center for Peace and Conflict Resolution
at Wayne State University.
   Founded in 1965 when the Vietnam War roiled campuses, the
university center then was all but alone in a field that now counts
more than 100 such programs.
   The center operates on a shoestring budget of $52,000 annually,
with a staff of two. It has struggled to pay its bills, adapt to
changing times and gain academic prestige. It offers undergraduate
courses in areas such as dispute resolution, the physics of nuclear
war, the Vietnam War and union-management relations.
e.''
After cooling down a bit, the girls agreed to split the cost of the
speaker.
   According to Marilyn Schmidt, director of the center's conflict
resolution training program in the high schools, its goal goes
beyond helping students get along better.
   ``We make the ties to a larger view of the world as a place
where the same techniques of conflict resolution can be used,'' she
says.
   Some on the Wayne State campus aren't happy with the center's
``view of the world'' and its advocacy of what they see as a
particular political position.
   ``At the time the center was founded, it attracted a number of
the liberal and left-liberal faculty members,'' says retired
geography Professor Fred Dohrs said.
   ``What the center has had ever since is a strong liberal bias,''
said Dohrs, who led a failed effort in the late 1970s to block
creation of a peace studies co-major for undergraduates at Wayne
State. The center's political bias, he says, has made it a
``miserable failure'' in pursuing open academic inquiry.
   ``There obviously is a good deal of suspicion here and elsewhere
about the existence of peace and conflict studies centers,'' says
Professor Melvin Small, a historian and adviser to students in the
co-major program.
   Small is author of ``Johnson, Nixon and the Doves,'' a study of
the effects of the anti-war movement on presidential decisions in
Vietnam.
   While faculty members' political views influence the topics they
choose to study or teach, they strive for fairness and objectivity
in their classes and writings, he says.
   Former Ohio Gov. John Gilligan, director of Notre Dame
University's Institute for International Peace Studies, says
political leaders never will be able to move toward reducing world
tensions unless universities serve as open forums for all possible
alternatives.
   Gilligan, a law professor, said his center was founded in
response to the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops' 1985 pastoral letter
on war and peace.
   Two $6 million grants from Joan Kroc, widow of McDonald's Corp.
founder Ray Kroc, have put Notre Dame's center at the forefront of
peace studies programs nationwide.
   ``We're up against some really hard facts of life,'' Gilligan
says. ``It's extremely important that the educational
establishment, all the way down to the kindergarten level, through
graduate school, get into it.
   ``We're drifting toward calamity.''

   Carroll O'Connor is quick to point out that
much has changed in the South since the filming of the 1967 movie,
``In the Heat of the Night,'' starring Rod Steiger and Sidney
Poitier.
   In the new NBC series based on the movie, O'Connor stars as Bill
Gillespie, police chief of the small Mississippi town of Sparta,
the role which earned Steiger an Academy Award as best actor. On
TV, Howard Rollins co-stars as Virgil Tibbs, whose appointment as
Sparta's black chief of detectives causes a stir in the Deep South
town.
   ``I'm playing this different from Rod,'' says O'Connor, the man
best remembered as Archie Bunker in ``All in the Family.'' ``Rod
played it as Southern police chiefs were in 1967. He deserved his
Oscar. Remember the news pictures coming out of the South at that
time, with the dogs and the fire hoses. But this is 1988. A lot has
happened in the South since then. The old attitude no longer works.
   ``So the chief is fundamentally still the same, but he knows he
has to make accommodations. It's against the law to discriminate
against black people and Bill Gillespie is going to make sure the
law is obeyed. He's a man in conflict. He learned racism at his
mother's knee, but he lives by the law and he respects the law.''
   O'Connor is holding court at a table designated by a brass
plaque as ``Carroll's Corner,'' in the Ginger Man, the Beverly
Hills restaurant he has owned for the past 11 years in partnership
with actor Patrick O'Neal. There's a telephone nearby and people
stop by to speak to him. Some wave from the sidewalk outside.
   He's wearing a light-colored summer suit and a bow tie. His hair
is snow white, and his eyes, behind his glasses, are a piercing
blue. He picks up a pipe and lights up before continuing:
   ``In the future we're not going to concentrate so much on the
crime. You can find that on every police show. We want to show what
crime does to the community and what it does to the policemen, and
how two men from very different backgrounds feel about it. The
white police chief and the black detective have fundamental
differences. They have different sentiments, and although crime
affects them in different ways they can work together.
   ``I think that eluded us in the first outing, but I think we'll
get it this time. People will say it's right on, which is what they
said about `All in the Family.'''
   The first season of the show was filmed entirely on location in
Hammond, La. But there is talk that the company may go to Northern
California for the fall season to save money.
   O'Connor says he found the people of Hammond cooperative and the
city seemed to him to be fully integrated. Nancy, and their son,
Hugh, joined him there. Hugh also works in his father's restaurant.
   He says that when he completed ``All in the Family'' in 1983 he
wasn't looking for a new series.
   ``I wanted to go to New York and do another play,'' he says. ``I
did one called `Brothers' and it was a miserable flop. Then I did
another, `Homefront,' and it was a flop, but not a miserable flop.
Both plays appealed to the audience but if you don't get the critic
for The New York Times your show folds. What you do is end up
putting on a play for just one man.''
   He also starred in a CBS movie called ``Brass,'' in which he
played the chief of detectives in New York City. He says it was not
a pilot, but concedes that any TV movie with a star is a de facto
pilot. He also starred in the NBC movie ``The Father Clements
Story.''
   ``I didn't do any pilots,'' he says, ``although we talked about
some. I was all set to do a show with ABC. I was going to be a kind
of old-time OSS or CIA man who's put in charge of a Russian
defector. We were to have various adventures together. But they
gave me a producer who'd had five flops in a row. I said no and
they gave me a month to find someone we'd all be satisfied with. I
suggested a couple of guys. That was the last I ever heard from
them.''
   O'Connor is surprised at how fast his latest series came
together.
   His first series, ``All in the Family,'' bounced from network to
network and went through several pilots before CBS finally put it
on the air in January 1971. It lasted for 12 years.
   This time, he says, ``I got a call from Freddie Silverman and he
asked me to meet him.'' Silverman was head of programming at CBS
when ``All in the Family'' went on the air. He later became
president of ABC Entertainment, then NBC, and currently is a
successful independent producer. His other shows include NBC's
``Matlock,'' ``Jake and the Fatman,'' now on standby at CBS, and
the ``Perry Mason'' movie series.
   ``We met right here, at this table,'' says O'Connor. ``He said
NBC is ready to do it. `If you'll do it, they'll do it.' I've had a
lot of people talk to me about series. It usually takes years.
Talk, talk, talk. So here is a producer who can put a deal together
in two weeks.''

   Ask Joan Rivers why she took a chance on
Broadway, and the answer comes back in her familiar rapid-fire
delivery.
   ``Are you kidding?'' she machine-guns. ``It's the best woman's
role written in the last five years. Besides, I wanted to see if I
could do it at this stage in my life.''
   Could the queen of 23 years of stand-up comedy, the woman who
coined the phrase ``Can We Talk?'' (it's now a federally registered
trademark) and a battle-scarred veteran of the television talk-show
wars become a plain, world-weary, middle-class Brooklyn housewife
whose marriage and life are falling apart?
   She could, and she did, earning cheers from audiences and
respect from the critics.
   The role is the centerpiece of Neil Simon's 1940s
autobiographical play ``Broadway Bound.'' Linda Lavin won a Tony
Award when she first did it in New York nearly two years ago, but
Rivers has made the role her own. Her contract with the play,
originally for four weeks, has been extended and there is talk she
may star in the London production when it opens next year.
   Rivers' success caps a turbulent and tragic year that began in
May 1987 when she was unceremoniously dumped from Fox
Broadcasting's late-night talk show after only seven months on the
air. Three months later her husband, Edgar Rosenberg, died from an
overdose of Valium.
   Rivers was determined to get back to work. ``Broadway Bound''
has been an effective tonic.
   ``It's the first good experience since my husband died and the
Fox firing,'' she says simply. ``It's been a very positive thing.''
   Rivers sits on a couch in her Madison Avenue hotel suite and
works on a needlepoint sampler. Spike, her tiny mop of a dog, sits
at her feet and chews contentedly on a bright pink slipper.
   ``One of the reasons I wanted to do the play was that nobody in
California thinks of me as an actress,'' Rivers says between
stitches. ``They would think of me only as talk-show hostess or a
stand-up comic.''
   That's a tough reality to face, particularly for someone who
says, ``The first thought about what I was going to do with my life
was that I was going to be an actress. From infancy on. No question
about it.''
   Simon and Gene Saks, the original director of ``Broadway Bound''
who came back to the show to help her, offered strong support.
   ``Simon said, `We don't want a stunt and Joan doesn't want it to
be a stunt,''' she recalls. ``I came in, read and they offered me
the part right there.
   ``I've been acting for a lot longer than people realize. You're
acting every minute when you do a stand-up. I knew it was still in
me. Timing. Inflection. There's so much to watch when you are
building a character. How she walks, how she stands, how she
reacts.''
   The role of Kate Jerome is not Rivers' first venture on
Broadway. She appeared in New York in 1971 in ``Fun City,'' a play
she co-wrote with her husband.
   ``It's a joy to see my name on the marquee,'' Rivers says.
``That's when I say, `Where's my mother? Where's my husband?'''
   It was Rosenberg who guided Rivers' career, the one person who
knew immediately when something wasn't working on stage or in a
club.
   ``He would have told me, `Do this differently or do that
differently,''' she says. ``I miss that part of it so much. He was
a brilliant editor, and I had respect for him.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Big Top Pee-wee''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   How does an adult reviewer approach a movie such as ``Big Top
Pee-wee''? Very carefully.
   If you lambaste it as an entertainment aimed at the 5-year-old
audience, you might be accurate. But you could also be accused of
being a kill-joy and a fogy. If you try to compare it with the
innocent comedy of the silent screen, you might also score some
points. But you could also be accused of hunting for gold in a pile
of dross.
   So here goes.
   ``Big Top Pee-wee'' is a clever piece of pure entertainment
conceived by Paul Reubens and executed by Pee-wee Herman, who are
the same person. Those who loved ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' will
adore this one.
   The story begins with Pee-wee waking up on the most antiseptic
farm in the world. Everything is sunny and bright, matching
Pee-wee's personality. The animals sleep on mattresss and eat
flapjacks at a picnic table. Pee-wee's greenhouse is a wonder. With
his magic food supplements, he can grow anything. Even hot dogs.
   Pee-wee's constant companion is Vance, a pure-white pig. Vance
talks. With a charity seldom seen in comedians, Pee-wee gives Vance
most of the punchlines. But then, how are you going to upstage a
talking pig?
   Every day Pee-wee is scheduled for a sandwich lunch with his
heartthrob, the local schoolmarm (Penelope Ann Miller). For such a
shy man, Pee-wee can be aggressive. He throws his body on top of
the schoolmarm, who resists him because the schoolkids are
watching. And taking snapshots.
   Then the circus comes to the farm. A new set of animals are
roaming the acres, as well as exotic circus people, such as the
Italian aerialist (Valeria Golino), with whom Pee-wee falls in
love. The townspeople object to having the circus in their midst,
providing a modicum of conflict to the script.
   Centerstage at all times is Pee-wee Herman, a man with a squeaky
voice, tight suit and white socks. He is, in the end, an endearing
character, guileless yet savvy. He wears well, despite the inane
circumstances in which he finds himself.
   Kris Kristofferson as the circus boss lends strength, though his
three-inch wife (Susan Tyrell) stretches fantasy too far. Randal
Kleiser directed in a straightforward fashion. Only one sequence is
truly hilarious, and that is borrowed from Alfred Hitchcock. When
Pee-wee finally makes love with the aerialist, we see a train
entering a tunnel (``North by Northwest'') and skyrockets exploding
(``To Catch a Thief'').
   ``Big Top Pee-wee'' was produced by Reubens and Debra Hill, and
written by him and George McGrath. The rating is PG, perhaps for
sexual innuendo. Running time: 87 minutes.

   ``Temple of Low Men'' (Capitol) _ Crowded House
   
   Crowded House's ``Temple of Low Men'' may be the catchiest
depressing album you'll ever hear.
   The New Zealand trio, behind Neil Finn's sprightly Paul
McCartney-like melodies and some killer hooks, became one of pop
music's most gratifying success stories in 1987 with such hits as
``Something So Strong'' and ``Don't Dream It's Over.''
   But don't look for any silly love songs on the follow-up
``Temple of Low Men.'' Finn's a brooder, worrying about everything
from doomed relationships to his own success.
   Finn seems especially wary of love on this album's bookends. ``I
Feel Possessed'' describes a lover's spellbinding hold on him, but
the narrator is as much scared by the power as consumed by it. And
``Better Be Home Soon,'' addressed to an absent lover, is more a
threat than a plea.
   On ``Mansion in the Slums,'' Finn tells everyone who covets his
kind of success that it's not worth it.
   ``The taste of success only lasts you half an hour or less,''
Finn sings. He declares that he'd much rather have a trampoline
than an isolation tank in an obvious jibe at the music business's
most tortured success, Michael Jackson.
   Why bother listening to another rock star complaining his life's
a mess? Because's the music's almost unerringly pretty. ``Better Be
Home Soon'' is the kind of lovely ballad McCartney used to be able
to toss off in his sleep, and the acoustic guitar-based tune will
probably benefit commercially from the current singer-songwriter
boom.
   ``Never Be the Same'' and ``I Feel Possessed'' are also
particularly strong. There's nothing as instantly accessible as the
hits from the first album, but ``Temple of Low Men'' rewards
repeated listening.
   Imagine what Crowded House could do if Neil Finn were happy.

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Showbiz Survivor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a community where ``survivor'' is an
overworked word, Liza Minnelli wears the designation with honor.
   She has been through it all: growing up in the shadow of a
tempestuous mother, Judy Garland; dancing on the stage of New
York's hallowed Palace theater at 7 while her mother sang
``Swanee''; dropping out of high school for the sake of show
business; watching her mother fall into the deadly spiral of booze
and drugs.
   There were triumphs as well. She won a Tony award in 1965 for
``Flora, the Red Menace.'' On television, her ``Liza With a Z''
brought a coveted Emmy in 1973, and in films she won an Academy
Award for best actress for her portrayal of Sally Bowles in
``Cabaret.''
   There also were two broken marriages to entertainer Peter Allen
and actor-producer Jack Haley, Jr., and an addiction to alcohol and
drugs that resulted in treatment at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho
Mirage, Calif., in 1984.
   But she's here and thriving more than ever with concerts, TV
specials and a tour with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., subbing
for the ailing Dean Martin.
   Minnelli is also back in movies. Her return after a lapse of a
few years was inauspicious: the short-lived ``Rent-a-Cop'' with
Burt Reynolds. She is starring again with Dudley Moore in ``Arthur
2: On the Rocks,'' which is having a rough time recapturing the
gaiety of 1981's original comedy hit.
   The actress said she had no apprehension about making the sequel
because ``the way I found out about it was great. Dudley called _
we're very good friends _ and he said, `I want you to read
something. I'm not going to tell you what it is; just read it and
call me back.'
   ``When I opened the package and read `Arthur on the Rocks,' I
said, `Oh, wait a minute, is this a good idea?' Then I read it, and
I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a wonderful script.
   ``At first I was worried because the writer and director of the
first film was Steve Gordon and he died, much to all of our sorrow.
I didn't think anyone could recapture those characters, but I think
Andy Breckman did a wonderful job. He seemed to have so much
affection for the original movie that he caught all the
characters.''
   In ``Arthur 2,'' Moore again portrays a prank-playing
multimillionaire who is seldom without a drink in his hand. Makes
you wonder why his wife (Minnelli) sticks with him.
   ``She loves him,'' Minnelli said. ``He's her husband, and she'll
do anything to defend him and don't anyone say anything bad about
him. That's the kind of woman she is.
   ``Did you ever see the `Thin Man' series? I went back and looked
at them. I learned a lot from Myrna Loy, and the way she portrayed
the wife (of William Powell). She was completely supportive, and
they had fun together. She was interested in everything her husband
did. That's how I tried to play Linda.
   ``Of course some day Arthur has to grow up. That's why she
leaves him. Sometimes it takes that kind of a shock in people's
lives to make them change.''
   Some critics have complained that Moore's boozing is no longer
funny in this era of alcoholism awareness.
   Minnelli had this response: ``We think back on W.C. Fields and
wonderful actors who have played classic American drunks. I think
Dudley created an entirely new character in Arthur; he's so sweet
and he tries to be good.''
   The daughter of Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli,
Liza grew up famous. But unlike some other Hollywood children, she
has managed to build a successful career and personal life; she is
married to artist Mark Gero.
   ``I grew up with a lot of love and support from my family,'' she
said. ``My family understood this town for what is was: a working
town, an industry town. Instead of mining, it happens to be movies.
My folks were level-headed. They instilled what I think are very
proper values.
   ``But you can only learn so much, and then you're on your own.
You have to either take responsibility for your own life, or keep
running it off onto your problems and on to chemicals or alcohol.
It's real easy to do, and it's understandable.
   ``When you realize that you're dependent on anything but the
human spirit, you get depressed. With any kind of good help, you
can get back on track. You just can.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Minimalism Triumphs for Philip Glass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minimalist composer Philip Glass says his
astonishing success in opera over the past decade heralds a return
to the spirit of the 1960s.
   ``I think idealism is something that is becoming acceptable
again, if I can put it that way, after a decade of materialism,''
he said.
   ``The idealism of the '60s, I believe that we're coming back to
that,'' he said. ``I think that young people are not all going to
be stockbrokers and lawyers.
   ``I think there's a reaction setting in against that kind of
materialism and lack of idealism. And in a way I think that's why
we're getting good audiences for these pieces.''
   Glass is probably ``the leading contemporary (opera) composer of
the day,'' said Rheinhard G. Pauly, a music professor and opera
historian at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore.
   ``He is one of the few contemporary opera composers who has
really developed a strong following. It's unusual for contemporary
opera to be really successful.''
   Casting simple themes in shimmering repetition and gradual
change that fans find entrancing and detractors find stupefying,
Glass also has won acclaim in film, theater, dance and other
musical modes.
   In recent years the 51-year-old Baltimore native has
collaborated with singer Linda Ronstadt, songwriters Paul Simon and
Suzanne Vega, dance choreographer Twyla Tharp and stage
director-designer Robert Wilson.
   His recent film scores include ``Koyanisqatsi,'' ``Mishima'' and
the recently released ``Powaqqatsi.''
   Glass was 39 when his first opera, ``Einstein on the Beach,''
was performed at the Avignon Festival in France in 1976.
   His second, ``Satyagraha,'' an account of Mahatma Gandhi's
development of the tactic of passive resistance as a young lawyer
in South Africa, was commissioned by the Netherlands Opera and
performed in Rotterdam in 1980.
   ``Akhnaten,'' based on an ancient Egyptian pharaoh and first
performed in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1984, completed a trilogy on
``historical figures who changed the world through the power of
their ideas,'' Glass said.
   All have been sell-outs in U.S. performances and have been
recorded on the CBS Masterworks label.
   ``Philip Glass operas always sell well,'' said Speight Jenkins,
general director of the Seattle Opera.
   ``I have found it (`Satyagraha') to be the most satisfying of
the works,'' Jenkins said. ``I think Philip Glass may be writing
better music now, but I also think I have never heard a better text
with one of his operas.''
   In a recent interview during a visit to promote the Seattle
Opera production of ``Satyagraha'' in July, Glass said Gandhi's
``stark idealism ... is one of the reasons why I think younger
people are very drawn to this work. I think younger people tend to
be more idealistic than the older folks.
   ``Gandhi was a man who was an idealist to the end of his days.
He proved ... that idealism isn't something you outgrow. You don't
have to. It can be something you can carry with you all your life.
That, in itself, is an inspiration.''
   The Stuttgart Opera has scheduled performances of ``Einstein,''
``Satyagraha'' and ``Akhnaten'' on successive nights in 1990.
   ``I think of `Einstein' as being the modern, kind of
psychokinetic opera, the one that's amplified and full of energy,''
Glass said. ``It kind of goes with the idea of nuclear energy and
progressive ideas in science, right?
   ``I think of `Satyagraha' as the lyrical opera, which is all
flowing, melodic lines and choruses. There's something very gentle
about `Satyagraha.' It's a lyrical opera.
   ``I think of `Akhnaten' as the tragic opera of the three, a very
dark one, the one that, at a certain moment, you realize no one
gets out of here alive.'' His fourth opera, ``The Making of the
Representative From Planet 8'' with a libretto by Doris Lessing,
premiered in Houston on July 8. Performances are scheduled later
this year in England and the Netherlands. In the script,
civilization on another planet is threatened by an ice age.
   His next, ``The Palace of the Arabian Nights,'' is set for a
premiere next year in France and is based ``loosely on the stories
of the stories of the Arabian nights,'' Glass said.
   Last March the Metropolitan Opera gave him a commission for
``The Voyage,'' a three-part allegory based on the exploration of
Christopher Columbus. The premiere is set for October 1992, the
500th anniversary of the sailing of the Pinta, Nina and Santa Maria
in America.
   Opera ``is the medium of choice for me ... the one in which the
composer plays a primary function,'' Glass said.
   ``The theater is the director's house. The ballet is the
choreographer's house. The opera is the composer's house,'' he
said. ``I like that.''
   From commissioning to staging typically takes three years, he
said.
   ``It takes a year to plan it, a year to write it and a year to
build it,'' he said. ``You spend a lot of time involved with your
subject, so I am very careful about my subject matter ... they do
become part of your life.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Glass Work Premieres to Mixed Reviews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest work by American minimalist
composer Philip Glass and Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry
Hwang, billed as a science fiction musical drama, has premiered in
Vienna, hallowed home of classical opera, to mixed reviews.
   The 90-minute piece, ``1,000 Airplanes on the Roof,'' opened
before an invited audience of some 500 people July 19 in the
unusual setting of a hangar at Vienna's Schwechat airport.
   The occasional shudder of a jet landing or the rising crescendo
of a takeoff punctuated the repetitive rhythms and melodies used by
Glass in his technically impressive score for soprano voice
synthesizers, flute, piccolo and alto and soprano sax.
   ``1,000 Airplanes on the Roof'' tells the story of M., a copy
shop worker in New York City who disappears for four days for an
encounter with the supernatural. M. realizes that he has had many
such meetings before in his life, but the difference this time is
that he remembers what he saw.
   When he returns to his workplace disheveled and tired, M. is
immediately taken to a psychiatrist. Realizing that he should bend
to the conventions of a three-dimensional world, he denies belief
in what he knows _ that there is a fourth and fifth dimension, and
higher intelligence out in space.
   Hwang, whose ``M. Butterfly'' won the Tony for best play of 1988
on Broadway, said the text is intended to show the tricks memory
plays on human beings, and how humans suppress unpleasant
recollections in order to preserve a chosen identity.
   Reviewers for Austria's two biggest-circulation newspapers
opined, however, that Hwang fell short of his high-minded target,
praising instead the intricate and attractive stage design of
Jerome Sirlin.
   ``This is a remarkable science fiction tale for which David
Henry Hwang concocted a tale full of banal presumptions,'' wrote
Karlheinz Roeschitz in Sunday editions of the Neue Kronen Zeitung.
   ``The Kafkaesque, critical message that Philip Glass and his
scriptwriter David Henry Hwang wanted to deliver just sinks in
empty science-fiction phrases,'' wrote Thomas Dombrowski in Kurier.
   Praising the technical perfection of Glass' composition,
Dombrowski added that ``nonetheless this music of the hard-working
Glass remains just a pleasant background to the real work of art of
this musical drama, the projections of the designer and architect
Jerome Sirlin.''
   Sirlin, who last year designed the set for Madonna's worldwide
``Who's That Girl?'' tour, acknowledges borrowing heavily from
Rudolf Svoboda, the Czech designer behind Prague's famed Laterna
Magika theater.
   Using Svoboda's technique of projecting slides on to a vast
stage set, Sirlin creates a constantly changing web of images
reflecting M.'s real and imagined surroundings.
   Rocco Sisto, as M., is on stage constantly, adding depth to
Sirlin's sets with well-acted mime but struggling occasionally to
get across the meaning of lengthy English-language monologues to a
German-speaking audience.
   Jointly sponsored by festivals in Austria, Berlin and
Philadelphia, ``1,000 Airplanes on the Roof'' cost the organizers
of the Danube festival, held for the first time this year in the
province of lower Austria adjoining urban Vienna, about $375,000.
   The trio, whose work moves to Berlin, and then Philadelphia at
the start of a 26-city tour, said they first thought of the idea of
a science fiction drama about 18 months ago.
   The bizarre title of the work emerged from what Glass said was a
story he was told separately by three people in Brooklyn, N.Y., San
Antonio, Texas and Geneva, Switzerland.
   Each reported what felt like an encounter with the supernatural
that ended with a crushing noise above their heads, Glass said.
They described the sound as ``like 100 airplanes on the roof,''
said the composer, adding ``I just made that 1,000 airplanes.''
   And do the authors themselves believe in close encounters of an
unnatural kind?
   ``When we started working, sitting in Philip's living room, I
kind of reluctantly volunteered a story from when I was 10 years
old and I saw a UFO,'' replied Sirlin.
   After a while, he recalled, Glass admitted seeing an
unidentified flying object once, too.
   ``With David, we both figured he had probably seen one too, or
had some experience that he's still not ready to talk about,''
Sirlin said.
   Hwang, quick to seize on his theme of selective memory, chuckled
in reply, ``I forgot.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Musical Salute to Led Zeppelin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in his solo career, Robert
Plant, who sang lead in Led Zeppelin for two decades, pays a
musical salute to the group that ended its reign in rock 'n' roll
when drummer John ``Bonzo'' Bonham died after a European tour in
1980.
   On his latest LP, ``Now and Zen,'' Plant has lifted guitar
riffs, bridges and musical phrases the group once used in their hot
tunes and inserted them into his new work. At the end of ``White,
Clean and Neat,'' Plant sings a bit of ``Since I've Been Loving
You'' _ a hit for Led Zeppelin in 1970. On stage, he puts some of
Zep's ``Custard Pie'' from the ``Physical Graffiti'' LP on the end
of ``Tall Cool One.''
   Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page also plays on Plant's first
single, ``Heaven Knows,'' and ``Tall Cool One,'' the current
single. Plant co-wrote and sang ``The Only One'' on ``Outrider,''
the new album Page has after years of semi-retirment.
   ``I'm tipping my hat, looking back,'' Plant said in an
interview. ``I've had kind of a mental block on that whole period.
Now I have no problem with it at all. I think it was crucial to
distance myself, just for my own integrity. I didn't know it was
going to happen like this. I thought I would forever be a little
reluctant and reticent but I see now that it's OK.
   ``I think this solo record is about the nearest I've got to
succeeding on nearly all levels. This is the most commercial and
attractive. It's the happiest record I've made probably in my
life.''
   Most of the musical references to Led Zeppelin are on the
fadeouts of tracks and they're done by a synthesizer briefly
recreating the Zeppelin music. Plant said now is a good time to
have a record out because there's a renewed interest in Led
Zeppelin.
   ``I think the time seems to be appropriate right now,'' he said.
``That's all right by me. My father always tells me, `Be thankful
for all mercies.''' Plant's father was a civil engineer in
Bromwich, Staffordshire, England, where he was born almost 40 years
ago.
   ``It's an interest in the music of the '70s, but we were from
the '60s,'' Plant said. ``It's sad, really, because I thought
somebody could have come up with something else by now.
   ``There are other things around. But there is also a lot of the
Led Zeppelin thing about. It would be nice to get something with
that kind of intent _ that thing, whatever it was that we had _
instead of all these impersonators trying to get somewhere near us
and generally missing by a good mile.''
   On ``Now and Zen,'' Plant has new partners: Phil Johnstone and
Dave Barrett, two young songwriters whose publisher sent Plant a
demo tape.
   ``I think the whole thing is a lot fresher,'' he said. ``It has
been a revival for me within myself, never mind within the industry.
   ``I just wanted to get songs. Then I could see what could happen
next. Of all the 100 or 120 tapes that had been sent me, I found
this one little old baby cassette tape had got the very essence of
what I wanted to do musically and what I've always felt that I
represented musically.
   ``There it was in its virgin splendor, `Heaven Knows,' with a
girl singing it. Virgin Publishing sent it. It was sent by some
astute lackey publisher's boy who knew that this was what everybody
else didn't know. Most publishers are hawking anything they can,
irrespective of whether it's the right thing for the job.
   ``It had some intrigue and some kind of mood that you don't get
on a pop record generally. You hear it sometimes on a Kate Bush or
Peter Gabriel record,'' Plant said.
   ``I arranged a meeting with Johnstone and Barrett. They arrived
late enough to be cool but not to be aggressive. It was really good
because they were arrogant and not impressed.
   ``From that meeting the three of us got together in Barrett's
bedroom, set up the computers and started chattering our way
through the first two songs that we wrote together. Barrett turned
knobs and stuff while Phil and myself wrote `White, Clean and Neat'
and `Tall Cool One.'''
   That was in December 1986. A band was assembled by March 1987;
final songs were written by the band, and recording started in May.
   Plant launched a U.S. tour in May. ``I think it's time to tour
and tour and tour and tour and tour and play and celebrate this new
thing and write the next album during the process of celebration.''
   The group goes to Europe in September, and might extend the tour
to the Orient and Australia.
   Plant turns 40 on Aug. 20, and had these observations about his
birthday: ``There's no deterioration anywhere particularly, a few
visual marks, a few fenders may need a little bit of adjustment
here and there. But the spirit and body and the man is doing fine
so it's of no consequence.
   ``I know it sounds corny but basically I'm thrilled and I'm glad
to be around.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: ``Love Story'' Author Finds Acclaim With
``Doctors''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erich Segal, the Brooklyn boy who went to Harvard,
taught classics at Yale and wrote ``Love Story,'' is still juggling
serious and popular writing in a leafy corner of London.
   He looks back on ``Love Story'' as a youthful Camelot, and
senses that with his latest novel, ``Doctors,'' he may finally
achieve the critical acclaim that has so far eluded him.
   At 51, he has temporarily given up the rigors of full-time
university teaching but remains a fellow at Oxford University's
Wolfson College. An occasional sports commentator, he dreams of
winning the over-60 category in the 1997 Boston marathon.
   ``I am today a writer who is lucky enough to have academic
privileges at Oxford,'' he says.
   Segal's fifth and most ambitious novel, ``Doctors,'' is the
first that did not draw on his own life. Instead it chronicles
members of the Harvard Medical School class of 1962, which included
several of his friends.
   He said he tried to tackle the subject of doctors and the
pressures they face with the passion of ``Love Story,'' his first
novel, and the scope of his last novel, ``The Class,'' a 25-year
fictional follow-up of his fellow Harvard graduates of 1958.
   ``For a long while I lived in gossip columns as Eric `Love
Story' Segal,'' he said in an interview.
   ``People would run up to me in airports and sing the first few
bars of the tune from the movie version. It's not such a bad thing.
If it had stopped there, I would have looked back on life as an
athlete looks back ... and say I was there once.''
   Instead, he moved on to such works as ``The Class'' and
``Doctors'' which, at 679 pages, is five times the length of ``Love
Story.'' Segal remarks: ``Publishers used to worry that my books
were too short. Now they're worrying that they're too long.''
   He doesn't feel he is an expatriate American writer. The
academic world is the same everywhere, he said, and with satellite
television and $168 fares to New York, America is never far away.
   ``In this day and age, if I need something from the Carnegie
Delicatessen, there's always the Concorde,'' he said, ``and it
never gets that bad.''.
   Segal's wife, Karen, is English and when Francesca, their
musically gifted 8-year-old daughter, started school, he decided it
was unfair to keep commuting between Yale and Oxford.
   But he hates Britain's weather and hopes to spend winters in
southern California and teach there when Francesca becomes a
teen-ager.
   Academics who have achieved popular success as writers include
British philosopher Iris Murdoch, American astronomer Carl Sagan
and Italy's Umberto Eco, a professor of semiotics.
   ``I only hope some day I'll reach the level of scholarship or
literary respectability that they've achieved,'' Segal said. ``It
gives me a goal to shoot for.''
   Segal speaks nine languages and has written a book on Roman
comedy and more than 50 articles on Greek tragedy, Latin poetry and
ancient athletics. But he has always found time to indulge his love
of pop literature.
   He wrote the Harvard Hasty Pudding Club show in 1958 and has
written or co-written several screenplays including The Beatles'
``Yellow Submarine'' in 1968.
   ``Love Story,'' his bittersweet tale of youthful love and death
which has sold more than 20 million copies in 33 languages since
publication in 1970, turned the unknown professor into an
international celebrity. The sequel, ``Oliver's Story,'' a 1977
best seller, was followed by ``Man, Woman and Child.''
   Although he was refused tenure at Yale in 1971 _ some say
jealous colleagues disdained his success _ Segal kept teaching and
writing. In 1981, he returned to Yale as a full professor, though
still without tenure, and retired in 1987.
   To critics who dismissed ``Love Story'' as fluff, he replies:
``Eighteen years later, when I find myself feeling guilty for all
that success and thinking `Love Story' was overrated, I pull out my
Encyclopedia Britannica and see myself listed as writing in the
tradition of the classic sentimental novelists, and then my ego
relights.
   ``It was my little Camelot and it can't be taken away. It was my
idyll.
   ``But fortunately, I got my second wind or second chance with
`The Class.' I had exhausted the possibilities of the sentimental
novel and I got into the saga business, which has vastly more raw
material.''
   ``The Class,'' a 1985 best seller, was Segal's first novel to
receive modest critical acclaim, winning literary prizes in France
and Italy. ``I actually thought `The Class' was the end, because
I'd written my life story into it, split apart,'' he said.
   He had qualms about writing ``Doctors,'' doubting his ability to
enter their world. He spent two years attending medical congresses,
talking to doctors and wandering through University College
Hospital in London weaing a white coat and a badge identifying him
as Dr. Segal.
   ``It says in little letters `professor of Latin,' so I could
walk the halls,'' said Segal, who has a doctorate in comparative
literature.
   Why doctors?
   ``Because they're very special,'' he said. ``They're the people
we fear, need, love and hate the most. ... And they are answerable,
so they think, only to God.''
   He says he set out to write a diatribe against unscrupulous
doctors, but met so many dedicated ones that he had to stop himself
from going the other way.
   An insomniac, Segal normally works from 4 a.m. to 5 p.m. without
leaving his desk. Then the slightly built athlete, who has
completed over 40 marathons, goes for a swim or a run.
   Segal says he is writing one more academic book, a history of
classical comedy, but his next novel depends on what happens to
``Doctors.''
   The first review, in Publishers Weekly, says the book addresses
``the gravest, most pressing issues facing doctors today and is
Segal's most skillfully written novel.''
   Segal, elated, says: ``That means I may be entering a phase of
respectability which I've always dreamed of.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Hit Songs Hurt His Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Songwriter Mickey Newbury says his
career suffered because of two of his best-known compositions:
``American Trilogy'' and ``Just Dropped In (To See What Condition
My Condition Was In).''
   Both songs, the 48-year-old writer-performer says, boxed him
into uncomfortable stereotypes, either as a patriot or a rocker.
   ``American Trilogy'' was a hit by Elvis Presley in 1973, and
``Just Dropped In'' was recorded by Kenny Rogers and the First
Edition in 1968.
   ``American Trilogy,'' a medley of ``Dixie,'' ``Battle Hymn of
the Republic'' and ``All My Trials,'' has been recorded or
performed by dozens of artists.
   ``It stopped me in my tracks for a few years,'' Newbury said in
an interview. ``The only thing I was getting asked to do was sing
the national anthem at football games and I didn't like it.''
   ``I did Bob Hope's Fourth of July show. You get a tag and it
stuck.''
   He says some people still come to his concerts to hear him
perform it.
   ``Hopefully, if I can get them in to see me because of that
song, they'll listen to something else I've done. It's the same
problem everybody has. For Jerry Reed and Ray Stevens, audiences
come in to hear their funny stuff but they have a serious side.''
   His reputation as a country music songwriter was undermined when
``Just Dropped In'' was taken as a song glorifying drug abuse.
   ``I was not taken seriously as a country songwriter for a
while,'' he recalled. ``It hurt me because of the insanity of the
music business. Everyone wanted to put you in a little pigeonhole.
   ``It was one of the first obvious anti-drug songs, yet it was so
controversial that some said it was detrimental. It was about a bad
acid trip. All the songs at that time were cloaked in metaphors
espousing the glory of hallucinogens. They talked about how
wonderful it was and how they open up your mind. It caused me to
write it. I knew it was not that way for everyone. It put some
people in the toilet.''
   Newbury, who now lives in Vida, Ore., has just released his 14th
album, ``Mickey Newbury in a New Age.''
   It's his first LP since 1981 and a kind of greatest hits album.
Yes, ``American Trilogy'' is on the disc, along with ``All My
Trials,'' ``San Francisco Mabel Joy'' and others.
   During his career he's also written ``Sweet Memories,'' a hit by
Andy Williams, and ``She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye,'' which
has been recorded by dozens of performers. Joan Baez and Ray
Charles are just two of the other singers who have recorded his
songs.
   Newbury describes a good song as ``a good story. Something
someone can relate to. A lot of songwriters get better as they get
older, but they've already written about most of the interesting
things in their life that happened when they were young and it was
new.
   ``The whole process that drives you to write is to write that
perfect song. No songwriter ever feels he's written that perfect
song. Stephen Foster did it already with `Beautiful Dreamer' and
yet when he died, he had a piece of paper in his pocket that said
`dear hearts and gentle people.' He had already started on another
song.
   ``I think Don McLean's song `Vincent' is a perfect song and I
have not heard many perfect songs: ones so finely crafted that you
say, `I can't make a change.'''

<HEAD>Nobel Sperm Bank Babies Are Graham's `Pride, Joy'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The walls of Dr. Robert K. Graham's
relatively ordinary-looking office are lined with the pictures of
dozens of babies he says are far from ordinary _ the products of
the so-called Nobel Prize sperm bank.
   ``This is our pride and joy and, by God, every one is a gem,''
said Graham of the children born to mothers inseminated with
``superior'' sperm provided by his Repository for Germinal Choice.
   Graham, 81, a multimillionaire who developed the shatterproof
eyeglass lens, is on a mission to save the human species. Superior
genes are being lost, he says, because society's smartest don't
have enough children while the masses proliferate with zeal.
   Graham founded the bank in early 1980 and began collecting the
sperm of a select few ``outstanding intellects'' and giving it to
qualified couples, with the goal of bringing into the world
potential leaders or great scientists.
   The bank claims responsibility for 55 babies, and 18 women are
pregnant.
   Graham says his program is working, that most of the children
develop at a much faster rate than their peers and are judged
gifted. Geneticists, however, still find fault, saying the program
minimizes women's role in reproduction and exaggerates the
likelihood children will inherit all their parents' good genes.
   But the proud parents cheer Graham for bringing them bright
children they deserved but couldn't have, usually because the
father was infertile.
   ``I just wanted to have a child,'' said Adrienne Ramm, a dancer
from New York City whose daughter Leandra turned 4 on Wednesday.
``I believe that the donor sprem was from a man that seemed to be a
great human being. We were increasing our chances of having a
bright and healthy child.''
   ``I can't imagine anyone would go there because they want a
super baby,'' said a Riverside mother who asked that her name not
be used. ``It's just the best choice available for those who choose
artificial insemination.''
   When Graham opened his repository, critics ranging from
feminists to communists and the Roman Catholic church denounced it
as a ``master race'' plan reminiscent of Adolf Hitler. The
controversy was fueled by Nobel Prize winner William Shockley's
revelation that he was a donor and by Graham's own views.
   Shockley, a physicist who invented the junction transistor,
believed that certain races _ blacks for example _ were genetically
disposed to be intellectually inferior.
   Graham, in his book ``The Future of Man,'' called man ``an
evolutionary derelict'' because ``huge masses of those with
ordinary minds have been allowed to come into being and then
proliferate.''
   Over time, artificial insemination became common, and more
radical techniques, like in vitro insemination and gene mapping,
took the spotlight in the reproductive industry. To Graham's
delight, protestors disappeared from outside his office about 30
miles north of downtown San Diego.
   Alexander Capron, a scholar at the University of Southern
California and former member of President Reagan's Commission on
Bio-ethics, has concerns with the repository, but gratefully notes
``it hasn't become a major force in reproduction.''
   ``I continue to think of it as a rather silly, misguided
effort,'' Capron said. ``The whole notion of individuality and of
uniqueness is what amounts to a genetic accident.
   ``The idea that you're going to get an `Olympian' could lead to
parents' frustrations when expectations aren't fulfilled.''
   Capron also has ethical concerns. ``What does it say about a
mother's contribution in reproduction? In it is the potential for a
more eugenic society with somebody deciding what genes get passed
along.''
   Graham counters that he neither promises nor expects the
children to reach their fathers' levels of success or intellect,
but says:
   ``We can with considerable assurance say we are contributing to
the next generation by bringing a number of capable, constructive
individuals, including leaders who wouldn't otherwise have been
born, or ... wouldn't be as bright.''
   The identities of donors, described by Graham as ``tops in their
field'' and ``outstanding intellects,'' are withheld from the
parents and the public. The list includes two Nobelists and an
Olympian. All are of European descent or Jewish, and most are
California scientists. Graham says he's invited blacks and Asians
to donate, but that they've refused.
   Donors are declared of good health and genetic ancestry, which
means their families are free of such diseases as alcoholism and
mental illness, and the donated sperm is screened for the acquired
immune deficiency syndrome virus. Part of the AIDS screening
includes a 180-day sperm quarantine.
   The sperm, stored in tanks of liquid nitrogen that keep it
frozen, has been sent around the country and as far away as Egypt.
   Applicant parents must show they are married, intelligent,
emotionally and financially stable, with a clean physical and
mental health history. The mother must be under age 38. About half
the applicants are rejected. Parents choose a donor from such
information as intelligence test score, ancestry, hair and eye
color, athletic ability, hobbies, and personality traits.
   When they had Leandra, Adrienne and David Ramm chose a
fair-haired science professor of European roots described as loving
gardening, skiing and children. For their second child, due next
month, they chose the Olympic athlete.
   ``At first, I did feel inadequate and weird about the idea of
using a donor,'' said Ramm, a computer systems manager who is
infertile. ``But Adrienne really wanted a baby and that was fine by
me. The only tough part is that since Leandra is so incredibly
bright she's constantly exploring and challenging and into
everything, which can be exhausting.
   ``But it's the price you pay for having such a bright baby.''
   Most sperm banks provide limited screening and don't allow
parents to choose among donors, and the repository parents say it
is the thorough medical check and quality of donors that draw them,
not a desire for super children.
   Repository parents also acknowledge they promote their child's
intellectual development and have high expectations, but say they
are not unreasonable.
   ``I don't have flash cards around the crib since he was two
weeks old, but I do expose Jeffrey to as much as I can,'' the
Riverside mother said.
   The 33-year-old woman and her 45-year-old second husband came to
Graham because the husband had a vasectomy in an earlier marriage.
Between them, they already had six other children from previous
marriages.
   Although her other children are bright _ her two teen-age girls
are honor students _ she says 1{-year-old Jeffrey is different: He
requires little sleep for his age, only seven hours, is extremely
inquisitive and loves books.
   Her stories echo those of other repository parents, several of
whom have come back for a second child, Graham says. The children's
``vocabulary is often twice that expected. They're standing early
and walking young.''
   Graham requires annual reports from parents, but is frustrated
that his experiment lacks rigid scientific standards because the
donors and parents vary and the children are raised in different
environments. But he added, ``The general consequences of bright,
happy kids is good enough for me.''

<HEAD>Bizarre Child Abuse Disorder Probably Often Overlooked, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boy's mother said he had cystic fibrosis,
and so did the lab tests. But the real disease was far more bizarre.
   And it lay within the mother.
   No parent could have been more dedicated during the 5-year-old's
hospitalizations. She stayed with him around the clock and often
helped the nurses giving him medications.
   But, doctors eventually realized, she also altered the boy's
stool and perspiration samples to make them consistent with cystic
fibrosis.
   She tried to cast doubt on a normal test result by calling the
hospital laboratory, giving a false name, and claiming the result
was phony. And she tricked a real cystic fibrosis patient into
giving her a sputum sample, then submitted the sample to doctors as
her son's.
   Her case is an elaborate example of a psychiatric disorder
called ``Munchausen syndrome by proxy,'' a variant of Munchausen
syndrome, in which a person fakes disease just to get medical care.
It is derived from Baron von Munchausen, an 18th century German who
became well known for elaborate lies.
   In Munchausen by proxy, typically, a mother produces disease or
the appearance of disease in her child, then acts like the model of
a dedicated and concerned parent.
   The disorder is probably relatively rare, but ``we suspect it's
more common than we think because it's so very difficult to
recognize,'' said David Waller, director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at the University of Texas Soutwestern Medical Center in
Dallas.
   Besides, few doctors are comfortable with confronting a
distraught mother who has just spent another sleepless night at the
child's bedside and asking ``Are you doing something to that
kid?,'' said Theodore Nadelson, chief of psychiatry at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Boston.
   Some mothers have slipped their own blood into a child's mouth
or urine samples. One was discovered giving a hospitalized infant
an enema and putting the fluid in the child's mouth. Another was
found to have been giving her child massive doses of a drug to
force vomiting. The child died.
   Just what motivates such behavior is not well understood.
   It appears to be a way to signal distress, Waller said. And the
parent ``gets a lot of reward from being seen as a wonderful,
caring parent in her role as helping the child get good medical
care.''
   Nadelson sees it as a pathological expression of hostility
against doctors and society. He considers it an addiction. ``People
who do it once will do it again consistently. It's very exciting.''
   Usually only one favored child is singled out for what the
mother and child consider a game, he said.
   Treating the disorder is very difficult because people deny that
they have the problem, Waller said. There have been anecdotal
reports of some treatment successes, said Allen Palmer, clinical
instructor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. But Nadelson
said he believes no treatment really works.
   Once a case is uncovered, the major goal is to protect the
child, Waller said. That sometimes means a court-ordered change in
custody.
   Most children involved in Munchausen by proxy are infants or
toddlers, but they can occasionally be older children like the boy
in the cystic fibrosis scam.
   Why do the older children go along with it?
   ``It's the only kind of love the child knows,'' Nadelson said.
``If it's love you're looking for, you'll take it under any
circumstances.''

<HEAD>New Exercise Program Aims To Stop Decline In Fitness Of American
Youth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new school exercise program that replaces
competition with individual tests and health education could
reverse the decline in fitness among American children while
helping them avoid injury, experts say.
   The American College of Sports Medicine is just starting to
promote the program, called Fit Youth Today, or FYT, which was
developed with the support of the American Health and Fitness
Foundation in Austin, Texas.
   ``It is state-of-the-art exercise science put into a workable
form for educators,'' said Wiliam Squires, professor of health
fitness and nutrition at Texas Lutheran College and chairman of the
task force that developed FYT.
   Unlike conventional school athletic programs, FYT does not favor
naturally gifted athletes. It rewards each student for attaining
his or her own fitness goals, whatever the level of athletic
ability, said Squires.
   ``The FYT program represents a real departure from traditional
fitness testing in this country,'' he said at a recent symposium
here. It includes an educational curriculum intended to teach
students about the importance of maintaining physical activity
throughout life.
   Less than 50 percent of American children have adequate
heart-lung endurance, and 40 percent of those 5-8 years old have
signs of elevated blood pressure, obesity or elevated cholesterol _
all of which increase the risk of heart disease, Squires said.
``The decline in youth fitness is real and is overwhelmingly
supported by study after study.''
   The consequences could be disastrous, he said, citing a study
reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control last year that
concluded lack of exercise was as strongly linked to heart disease
as smoking, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
   In conventional programs, students are often measured against
norms set by their peers. FYT conditions them not to run faster or
jump higher than others but to be able to jog a set distance in 20
minutes, perform certain exercises demonstrating strength and
flexibility, and reduce body fat specified levels.
   The key point is that the goals emphasize aerobic fitness,
strength and weight loss _ not maximum performance, Squires said.
   Carl Caspersen, an exercise physiologist and epidemiologist at
the CDC in Atlanta, said FYT's success will be measured by ``how
well it motivates changes in behavior and guarantees an active
lifestyle.
   ``It is the physical activity we're interest in, and if the
testing encourages activity, that's what we're trying to achieve.''
   FYT also is designed to avoid athletic injuries that can have
more serious consequences in children than they do in adults.
   Children are unusually susceptible ``overuse injuries,'' said
Dr. Lyle Micheli, an orthopedist and director of the Division of
Sports Medicine at Children's Hospital in Boston.
   These occur when joints and bones with soft growing surfaces are
repeatedly subjected to small bumps and stresses, which may alone
be painless but can add up to significant damage after prolonged
exercise without proper training and conditioning.
   Children undergoing the adolescent growth spurt between about
ages 12 and 14 become less flexible and are especially likely to
suffer overuse injuries, Micheli said, adding coaches need to be
trained to recognize subtle damage.
   He cited ``little-league elbow,'' in which children who aren't
taught to throw properly can chip tiny flakes off their throwing
elbow. Ultimately, those chips grow into pebble-sized pieces that
can cause excruciating pain _ and can end a young baseball player's
season abruptly.
   ``Is running good for kids? Absolutely,'' he said. ``Is too much
running bad for kids? Absolutely. The question is how much is too
much.''

<HEAD>Nobel Sperm Bank Babies Are Graham's `Pride, Joy'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note Wednesday time element is July 27.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The walls of Dr. Robert K. Graham's
relatively ordinary-looking office are lined with the pictures of
dozens of babies he says are far from ordinary _ the products of
the so-called Nobel Prize sperm bank.
   They are the children born to mothers inseminated with
``superior'' sperm provided by 8-year-old Graham's Repository for
Germinal Choice. The bank claims responsibility for 55 babies, and
18 women are pregnant.
   Graham, 81, a multimillionaire who developed the shatterproof
eyeglass lens, is on a mission to save the human species. Superior
genes are being lost, he says, because society's smartest don't
have enough children while the masses proliferate with zeal.
   He says his program is working, that most of the children
develop at a much faster rate than their peers and are judged
gifted. Geneticists, however, still find fault, saying the program
minimizes women's role in reproduction and exaggerates the
likelihood children will inherit all their parents' good genes.
   But the proud parents cheer Graham for bringing them bright
children they deserved but couldn't have, usually because the
father was infertile.
   ``I just wanted to have a child,'' said Adrienne Ramm, a dancer
from New York City whose daughter Leandra turned 4 on Wednesday.
``I believe that the donor sprem was from a man that seemed to be a
great human being. We were increasing our chances of having a
bright and healthy child.''
   When Graham opened his repository, critics ranging from
feminists to communists and the Roman Catholic church denounced it
as a ``master race'' plan reminiscent of Adolf Hitler. The
controversy was fueled by Nobel Prize winner William Shockley's
revelation that he was a donor and by Graham's own views.
   Shockley, a physicist who invented the junction transistor,
believed that certain races were genetically disposed to be
intellectually inferior.
   Alexander Capron, a former member of President Reagan's
Commission on Bio-ethics, has concerns with the repository, but
gratefully notes ``it hasn't become a major force in reproduction.''
   The identities of Graham's donors are withheld. The list
includes two Nobelists and an Olympian. All are of European descent
or Jewish, and most are California scientists. Graham says blacks
and Asians have refused to donate.
   Donors are declared of good health and genetic ancestry, and the
sperm is screened for the AIDS virus.
   Applicant parents must show they are married, intelligent,
emotionally and financially stable, with a clean physical and
mental health history. The mother must be under age 38. About half
the applicants are rejected.
   When they had Leandra, Adrienne and David Ramm chose a
fair-haired science professor of European roots described as loving
gardening, skiing and children. For their second child, due next
month, they chose the Olympic athlete.
   Graham requires annual reports from parents, but is frustrated
that his experiment lacks rigid scientific standards because the
donors and parents vary and the children are raised in different
environments. But he added, ``The general consequences of bright,
happy kids is good enough for me.''

<HEAD>Bizarre Child Abuse Disorder Probably Often Overlooked, Experts</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Say
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boy's mother said he had cystic fibrosis,
and so did the lab tests. The real disease was more bizarre, and it
lay within the mother.
   No parent could have been more dedicated during the 5-year-old's
hospital stays. She stayed with him around the clock and often
helped nurses giving him medications. But doctors eventually
realized she also altered his stool and perspiration samples to
match cystic fibrosis symptoms.
   She even tried to cast doubt on a test result, and tricked a
real cystic fibrosis patient into giving her a sputum sample, then
submitted it to doctors.
   Her case is an elaborate example of a psychiatric disorder
called ``Munchausen's syndrome by proxy,'' a variant of
Munchausen's syndrome, in which a person fakes disease to get
medical care. In Munchausen's by proxy, a mother typically produces
disease or the appearance of disease in her child, then acts like
the model of a dedicated and concerned parent.
   The disorder is probably relatively rare, but ``we suspect it's
more common than we think because it's so very difficult to
recognize,'' said David Waller, director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at the University of Texas Soutwestern Medical Center in
Dallas.
   Such behavior appears to be a way to signal distress, or
hostility against doctors and society, experts say. And the mother
``gets a lot of reward from being seen as a wonderful, caring
parent in her role as helping the child get good medical care,''
Waller said.
   ``People who do it once will do it again consistently,'' usually
singling out a child for what mother and child consider a game,
said Theodore Nadelson, chief of psychiatry at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Boston.
   Treatment is difficult because people deny they have a problem.

<HEAD>New Program Aims To Stop Decline In Fitness Of American Youth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new school exercise program that replaces
competition with individual tests and health education could
reverse the decline in fitness among American children while
helping them avoid injury, experts say.
   The American College of Sports Medicine is just starting to
promote the program, called Fit Youth Today, or FYT, which was
developed with the support of the American Health and Fitness
Foundation in Austin, Texas.
   FYT does not favor natural athletes. It rewards each student for
attaining his or her fitness goals, whatever the level of athletic
ability, said Wiliam Squires, professor of health fitness and
nutrition at Texas Lutheran College and chairman of the task force
that developed FYT. It also teaches students about the importance
of maintaining physical activity throughout life.
   Less than 50 percent of American children have adequate
heart-lung endurance, and 40 percent of those 5-8 years old have
signs of elevated blood pressure, obesity or elevated cholesterol _
all of which increase the risk of heart disease, Squires said.
``The decline in youth fitness is real and is overwhelmingly
supported by study after study.''
   In conventional programs, students are often measured against
norms set by their peers. FYT conditions them not to run faster or
jump higher than others but to be able to jog a set distance in 20
minutes, perform certain exercises demonstrating strength and
flexibility, and reduce body fat specified levels.
   The key point is that the goals emphasize aerobic fitness,
strength and weight loss _ not maximum performance, Squires said.
   Children are unusually susceptible ``overuse injuries,'' from
exercise without proper conditioning and training, said Dr. Lyle
Micheli, an orthopedist and director of sports medicine at
Children's Hospital in Boston.
   ``Is running good for kids? Absolutely,'' he said. ``Is too much
running bad for kids? Absolutely. The question is how much is too
much.''

<HEAD>Contrast Agent Lets Magnetic Scan Detect Liver Cancer Sooner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A solution of iron oxide injected into a patient's
veins can significantly improve the ability of magnetic scanning
machines to pinpoint extremely small cancers of the liver, doctors
say.
   The development should make it possible to detect this kind of
cancer early, when it can still be removed surgically, and to
better determine how far it has progressed, Dr. David D. Stark and
colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital reported in the August
issue of the journal Radiology.
   Doctors using the technique administer the iron oxide then take
a cross-sectional picture with a standard magnetic resonance
imaging, or MRI, scanner. The iron oxide is absorbed by healthy
cells but not by cancerous ones, making the cancers clearly stand
out on magnetic pictures.
   Tests on 60 people showed that the technique could spot tumors
as tiny as 3 millimeters, three times smaller can be found with
other scanning methods.
   Whether liver cancer is treated with surgery, chemotherapy or
radiation depends on the stage of the disease.
   ``Our purpose is to reduce some of the anguish of misdiagnosis
and unnecessary surgery, as well as their cost, by accurate
detection of metastases (spread) in the liver, which before now
were too small to be visible early enough to appropriately stage
the patient's disease prior to treatment,'' said Stark.

<HEAD>Altered Superconductor May Be Useful In Frictionless Bearings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Superconductors usually repel magnets, but new
experiments show that with slight alterations they'll attract and
hang suspended from magnets, raising the prospect of their use in
frictionless bearings.
   The researchers added silver oxide to the traditional
superconductor mixture of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen in
pellets that they chilled in liquid nigrogen to make them
superconducting. When they lowered a magnet toward a pellet, a
``supercurrent'' appeared on the pellet's surface that repelled the
magnet. But when the magnet was pulled back, the weakening of the
magnetic field affecting the pellet triggered another supercurrent
that led to attraction toward the magnet.
   The attraction was strong enough to suspend the superconductor
about half an inch below the magnet. It weakened if the magnet came
closer than the half-inch and strengthened farther away, so the
pellet hung at the half-inch gap.
   The suspension effect was reported by C.Y. Huang of Lockheed
Missiles & Space Co.; M.K. Wu of the University of Alabama at
Huntsville; and P.N. Peters and colleagues at the NASA Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, in the June 13 issue of Applied
Physics Letters. Further work has involved Brian Schwartz of
Brooklyn College in New York, and others.
   They suggest that the work could lead to development of
frictionless bearings. Experts unconnected with the studies said
the effect may help in understanding superconductivity, but they
doubted it had important practical applications.
   Superconductors can carry electricity with no resistance.
Scientists hope they will help in developing more powerful
computers, high-speed trains and other uses.

<HEAD>Sneezing After Sex Probably Not An Allergy, Doctor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What sounds like an allergy to sex is more likely
a reaction to a common nasal inflammation, a doctor says of a
patient who sneezes repeatedly after intercourse.
   ``This is the most unusual problem I have ever been presented
with by a patient,'' Dr. William H. Hunter of Clemson, S.C., wrote
in the question-and-answer section of last week's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The problem is probably due to vasomotor rhinitis, ``a fairly
common syndrome'' in which the nasal passages are chronically
inflamed, responded Dr. Jeffrey A. Wald of San Diego, Calif.
   The condition is characterized by ``hyperactive'' or
``imbalanced'' control of certain nervous-system responses, Wald
said. Some nasal tissue is similar to that in the penis, so sexual
arousal thus may cause swelling of the mucous membranes inside the
nose, and an increase in nasal secretions, he said.
   Those symptoms likely trigger the sneezing attacks in Hunter's
patient _ a 60-year-old man with a history of allergies _ because
of the nervous system impairment brought on by the rhinitis, Wald
wrote.
   Those suffering from rhinitis frequently don't respond to
traditional treatment _ antihistimines and decongestants _ or
complain of side effects, he wrote, suggesting intranasal use of a
drug called ipratropium bromide if traditional treatment doesn't
work.

<HEAD>New Corn Variety Packs Better Nutrition, Panel Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new variety of corn provides higher quality
protein than common types and could greatly help many of the
world's undernourished people, a National Research Council
committee says.
   The ``quality-protein maize'' looks and tastes like common corn
but is nearly as good a protein source as skim milk, the committee
said.
   Corn is a dietary staple for some 200 million people, including
maybe half the world's undernourished population. In some parts of
Latin America and Africa, it is the primary or sole protein source
for young children.
   But protein in traditional corn does not contain enough of two
essential amino acids, lysine and tryptophan. So corn itself is not
enough for acceptable growth and health, especially in children,
the sick, and pregnant and lactating women, the council said in a
statement.
   The new corn variety was developed at Mexico's International
Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat. The committee report
expressed confidence that it will be grown worldwide before the
turn of the century.

<HEAD>Get Family History of Diseases to Assess Future Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People should be nosy about what Aunt Minnie
died of or what chronic diseases other relatives have had because
it may reveal inherited hazards in the family, a genetics expert
says.
   Questions about diseases in the family are not offensive if they
are framed as requests to help future generations, and ``you really
have an obligation to ask because it may be something that somebody
other than you is at risk for,'' said Judith Hall, professor of
medical genetics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
   ``Older members have an obligation to pass along the information
they have,'' Hall said after a recent science writers conference
sponsored by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
   ``I think it's absolutely legitimate to ask for an autopsy
report,'' which can reveal inherited conditions such as
hemochromatosis, a buildup of iron in the tissues that can
complicate other diseases, she added.
   For the family history, questions should focus on causes of
death, chronic illnesses, reasons for hospitalization, long-term
medication or chronic medical care before age 50, cancer before age
60, cancer in both breasts, diseases that killed more than one
family member, and heart attacks or strokes before age 50.
   The information should be passed on to relatives and the family
doctor.
   Every person carries five to eight genes that can increase the
risk of disease in offspring if the other parent has a
corresponding genetic defect, Hall said. For example, one in 20
Caucasians carries the defective gene that causes cystic fibrosis;
one in 10 blacks carries the sickle cell anemia gene.
   She also said half of all admissions to pediatric hospitals
involve conditions with an inherited predisposition, such as kidney
disease, cancer, diabetes and heart abnormalities.

   Business leaders have grown more confident about
the economy, although they remain worried about a possible
recession, according to a private survey.
   The Conference Board, a business financed research group, said
its business confidence index rose to 58 during the second quarter
from 51 during the first three months of the year.
   The index released Sunday, compiled from a survey of about 1,000

following the October stock market crash.
   The latest survey found an increase in confidence among
executives in nine of the country's top 15 manufacturing industries
and five of 10 leading non-manufacturing industries, the Conference
Board said in a news release.
   Most of the survey respondents said ``the economy and their own
industries are stronger now'' than before the crash, said Steven
Malin, senior economist for the business research group.
   ``But anxiety about rising inflation and interest rates
continues to dampen enthusiasm about prospects for the second half
of 1988,'' Malin said.

   Mergers and acquisitions in the computer
software and services industry heated up to record levels in the
first half of 1988, according to a new survey.
   The number of deals rose 39 percent in comparison to the same
period a year earlier, while the value of the deals shot up to $5.4
billion, more than twice as great as in the first half of 1987.
   The survey provided to The Associated Press is conducted by
Broadview Associates, a Fort Lee, N.J.-based investment banking
firm, for Adapso, an Arlington, Va.-based computer software and
services industry association.
   The biggest deal of the half-year was Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s
$1.6 billion acquisition of IMS International, a provider of market
information for the health-care industry, Broadview said.
   That deal ranked as the second largest ever behind General
Motors Corp.'s $2.5 billion acquisition of Electronic Data Systems
in 1984.
   There were 10 other deals for over $100 million, including one
valued at $500 million in which a 50 percent share of United
Airlines' Apollo reservation system was bought by five airlines:
British Airways, Swissair, KLM, Alitalia and USAir.
   Edward Metz, a partner in Broadview, said the airline deal
indicated the importance of controlling computer technology to
``attaining and maintaining an international competitive edge.''
   Software and services companies are popular because they are
rapidly growing, generate a lot of cash and have a stable base of

   The dollar held steady against most major
currencies in European trading today after intervention by West
Germany's central bank dulled its strong opening, dealers said.
Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar rose in thin early
dealings, with players in Frankfurt taking profits on the pound.
   But later they said intervention by the Deutsche Bundesbank
halted the dollar's rise, and at midmorning the market appeared to
be taking a wait-and-see attitude.
   ``The market is rather indecisive right now,'' said one senior
trader with a bank in Milan.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7358, compared
with $1.7405 Friday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8360 West German marks, up from 1.8265; 1.5266
Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 6.1920 French francs, up from 6.1630;
2.0710 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0615; 1,357.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,353.75; and 1.2030 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.28 yen to a closing 131.80. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 131.65 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $442.60 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $442. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $442.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $442.50, unchanged from $442.50
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid price of $444.28,
compared to Saturday's $444.62 and late Friday's $444.86 closing.
   Later, silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $7.56 a
troy ounce, down from Friday's $7.76.

<HEAD>London Stock Prices Steady After Sharp Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices fell Monday amid bargain-hunting in
light trading.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 9.5
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,835.3 at midday, after having fallen
18 points in early trading. Volume was 169.1 million shares,
compared to 233.1 million shares at the same time Friday.
   The early declines came on the back of a strong pound and poor
performances in New York on Friday and in Tokyo earlier Monday.
   Some traders said they were encouraged that the market found the
energy to recover some ground.
   ``It hasn't been all that bad,'' said one trader. The lows
created ``a good buying opportunity'' in some stocks, he said.
   But the buying enthusiasm which lifted stocks wasn't expected to
carry into the afternoon, traders said. They said they expected the
market to drift.
   ``I don't think there's any great excitement,'' a trader said.

   Pillsbury Co. said Monday it has signed a
definitive agreement to buy Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inc., a privately
held producer of canned tuna and other seafood.
   Terms of the agreement were not announced, Pillsbury said in a
prepared statement.
   Pillsbury's announcement came three days after H.J. Heinz Co.
said its agreement to acquire Bumble Bee had been terminated
because the federal government was trying to block the deal on
antitrust grounds.
   Pillsbury also said Monday it intends to divest its
Minneapolis-based grain merchandising division, which operates
grain handling and storage facilities primarily in the upper
Midwest. The company said it expects to identify a buyer within the
next few months.
   Proceeds from the sale of the grain merchandising division and
other sources of internal funding are expected to cover a major
portion of the costs associated with the Bumble Bee acquisition,
Pillsbury's statement said.
   Although grain merchandising has been quite profitable, the
company has indicated the division is not part of Pillsbury's
long-term strategic plans, according to the statement.
   ``Today's announcements represent a continuation of our
commitment to quality, branded products with unique strengths that
provide new growth opportunities for the future,'' said John L.
Morrison, chairman of Pillsbury's Consumer Foods Group.
   ``We expect Bumble Bee to be a positive contributor to
Pillsbury's earnings in the first year of operation,'' Morrison
added.
   Bumble Bee will continue to operate under its current management
as a wholly owned subsidiary with headquarters in San Diego,
according to Pillsbury's statement.
   Bumble Bee, with 1987 sales of $265 million, is a top seller of
white meat, or albacore, tuna and canned salmon.
   Pillsbury, an international food and restaurant organization
with fiscal 1988 sales of $6.2 billion, includes the Van de Kamp's
frozen seafood line which it acquired in 1984. Among the company's
other brand names are Pillsbury, Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs, Burger
King, Steak and Ale, and Bennigan's.

<HEAD>Price Supports, Import Quotas Keep U.S. Sugar Costs High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government sugar policy can be sweet for
domestic producers who enjoy high price supports, or bitter for
foreign sugar-producing countries whose access to the American
market is limited by strict quotas, an Agriculture Department
report says.
   ``Although fewer than 1 percent of American farmers grow sugar
cane or sugar beets, the commodity is one of the most heavily
protected by price supports and import quotas,'' the report said.
   Those in favor of current policy say federal protection is
necessary for the survival of the U.S. sugar industry. Without it,
they say it would be impossible for American growers to compete
with cheaper sugar from countries that have much lower production
costs.
   Another argument is that the U.S. corn industry also benefits
from higher sugar prices by boosting demand for HFCS, or high
fructose corn syrup, in soft drinks and many other food products.
   But USDA analysts say the other side of the coin includes higher
retail prices for American sugar consumers and lost sales _ because
of import quotas _ for some U.S. allies who depend greatly on sugar
as an export commodity.
   Sugar crops are supported at the equivalent of 18 cents per
pound of raw sugar equivalent through ``non-recourse'' loans made
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. It means that if market
prices fall below the loan rate, sugar processors can forfeit their
collateral without penalty.
   In that case, the loan obligation is canceled and the CCC takes
over ownership of the foreclosed sugar and holds it as surplus.
   To minimize the risk of forfeiture and to head off large rises
in CCC holdings, the market price must be high enough to cover the
loan rate, plus interest, plus marketing charges. The desired price
is called the Market Stabilization Price, or MSP. For 1987-88, the
MSP is 21.76 cents per pound.
   In the first quarter of this year, the duty-paid price of raw
sugar delivered to New York averaged 22.03 cents per pound, well
above the MSP. Comparatively, the ``world price'' of sugar, based
on Caribbean shipping points, was less than 10 cents per pound.
   To prevent lower-priced foreign sugar from pulling down the U.S.
domestic price, import quotas allocated to specific countries have
been set each year since 1982. The quotas keep the supply tight
enough to maintain prices near the MSP, says economist Robert Barry
of the department's Economic Research Service.
   ``If the estimates of supply and demand are accurate, domestic
sugar prices stay high enough to prevent loan forfeitures,'' Barry
writes in the forthcoming August issue of Farmline magazine. ``A
loan forfeiture presents a surplus and storage problem for the
CCC.''
   Federal law stipulates that the sugar price support program is
to be operated at no net cost to the taxpayers.
   The cost of the program is basically paid for by American
consumers through higher prices for table sugar and products that
contain sugar, Barry said.
   Who benefits? Growers and processing companies, who are
guaranteed the support price. Also, indirectly, the corn sweetener
industry, which has seen HFCS become the dominant sweetener for
soft drink manufacturers, Barry said.
   Glucose and dextrose, also made from corn, for many years had
held about 17 percent of the calorie-type sweetener market. But
when the new liquid HFCS came along, it became the major caloric
sweetener used in soft drinks.
   In 1988, per capita consumption of HFCS is forecast at 69.5
pounds per American, 10 percent more than the average for sugar.
   Foreign manufacturers of products containing sugar, and American
consumers of certain imported gourmet food items made from
lower-cost foreign sugar, also benefit from the U.S. policy.
   Meanwhile, Barry said, the price support program has encouraged
greater U.S. domestic sugar production, thereby reducing import
requirements, adding to the world export surplus and keeping world
prices low.
   Sugar-importing nations also benefit, he said. By encouraging
surpluses and low world sugar prices, the support program of the
United States and some other countries ``create a windfall'' for
the Soviet Union, Japan and China, the major sugar importers.
   Barry said the program also has an effect on U.S. employment.
When import quotas shrink, refineries close because they have less
foreign raw sugar to process. Since 1982, eight plants have closed,
eliminating more than 7,000 jobs, he said. And additional jobs are
lost when U.S. manufacturers of sugar-containing products reduce
output.
   The highest cost of the sugar program is paid indirectly by
sugar exporters, Barry said. For years, the United States was the
largest importer, with foreign shipments reaching a peak of 6.1
million tons in 1977 and averaging 4.2 million tons a year from
1975 to 1981.
   In 1988, the U.S. sugar import quota initially was about 750,000
tons but was increased Friday to 1.06 million tons.
   Several bills in Congress would alter the sugar program. One
would reduce the support price to 12 cents per pound from the
current level of 18 cents over a period of four crop years. Also,
the import quota would be increased by 500,000 tons a year for four
years, beginning in 1989.
   Barry said that the lower support ``should lower market prices,
and this would probably discourage production in the United States
and increase the demand for imported sugar.''

<HEAD>Exxon Reports Second-Quarter Earnings Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil company,
today reported a 4 percent increase in second-quarter net income as
higher refining and chemicals earnings offset lower exploration and
production results.
   Exxon said it earned $1.2 billion, or 90 cents a share, up from
net income of $1.15 billion, or 81 cents a share in the second
quarter of 1987.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 7 percent to $21.63 billion from
$20.16 billion a year ago.
   Exxon Chairman L.G. Rawl noted that ``margins were stronger as
supply costs dropped and product prices firmed'' during the
quarter. He also said increased demand for petroleum products
boosted sales volume in both the United States and abroad.
   Earnings from exploration and production operations totaled $703
million, $183 million less than the year-ago period. The company
noted that lower crude oil sales to its own refineries as well as
to outside customers coupled with higher expenses to offset
increased crude production from new and expanded oil fields.
   The company's chemicals operation reported an $89 million
increase in earnings to $314 million, while higher copper prices
helped the coal and minerals unit report net income of $8 million,
compared with a $14 million loss a year ago.
   Exxon reported corporate and financing charges of $172 million,
up from $24 million a year go.
   For the first six months, Exxon reported net income of $2.66
billion, or $1.96 a share, up 20 percent from $2.22 billion, or
$1.56 a share in the first half of 1987.
   Revenue during the period totaled $43.63 billion, up 10 percent
from revenue of $39.6 billion in the year-ago period.

<HEAD>OPEC Pricing Committee To Meet Aug. 3, Report Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five-member OPEC pricing committee
has decided in principle to meet Aug. 3 in Lausanne, Switzerland,
primarily to deal with a decision by the United Arab Emirates to
increase its oil production, a newsletter reported Monday.
   The respected Middle East Economic Survey said the committee of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is ``expected to
go through the formal motions of reviewing the market situation.''
   But it said ``the main topic on the agenda will be the U.A.E.'s
unilateral decision to allocate itself an `official' quota of 1.5
million barrels a day'' and the impact of this on OPEC's production
quota and the market.
   There has been no official announcement of the meeting of the
committee, comprisng oil ministers of Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia,
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
   A final decision on the meeting may depend on the visit of OPEC
Secretary-General Subroto, of Indonesia, to the U.A.E., the
newsletter said. He is expected there later this week after
finishing the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
   The Middle East Economic Survey said Dr. Subroto faces a
difficult task because the U.A.E.'s Supreme Petroleum Council
decided July 18 to increase production to 1.5 million barrels a
day. The U.A.E.'s OPEC-set production quota is 948,000 barrels a
day.
   Crude oil prices have fallen below the OPEC benchmark price of
$18 a barrel, even without the increase in production by the
U.A.E., largely because of increased non-OPEC production and
above-quota production by OPEC members.
   To enforce the $18 price, OPEC alloted each of its members a
quota with total OPEC production set at 15 million barrels a day.
   This excludes Iraq which refused its allotted quota of 1.54
million barrels a day and has insisted on a quota equal to that of
Iran, its Persian Gulf war opponent, or 2.37 million barrels a day.
Meanwhile, Iraq has been producing at a level of about 2.7 million
barrels a day.

<HEAD>Amfac Negotiating With Other Bidders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amfac Inc., which two months ago unveiled
an $800 million leveraged buyout plan, announced Monday that it is
negotiating the sale of the company with several unidentified
bidders.
   Amfac said in a statement that it received bids over the weekend
that were ``in the high $40s per share.'' The company did not
elaborate and warned investors ``that no assurances can be given as
to the probable outcome of the negotiations.''
   Amfac Chairman Henry Walker Jr. said the company has instructed
its financial advisors ``to work to finalize the best transaction
for the company and its shareholders.''
   In late May, Amfac management proposed to acquire the company
for $41 a share, or $807.7 million.
   Amfac's shares consistently have traded above management's
offering price, indicating Wall Street expected the bid to be
improved. In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange Monday,
Amfac jumped $1.12{ to $47.87{.
   Analysts have speculated that Amfac's management-led buyout was
a move designed to stave off a takeover threat by Castle & Cook
Inc., a Los Angeles-based concern that holds a large block of Amfac
stock.
   Two months ago Castle & Cooke held 7.3 percent of Amfac's
roughly 17.2 million oustanding common shares and had received
federal clearance to increase its holdings to 15 percent.
   In addition, Castle & Cooke Chairman David H. Murdock at the
time owned another 2.6 percent of Amfac's outstanding shares.
   Analysts have said Castle & Cooke was most interested in Amfac's
valuable real estate holdings in Hawaii, which total about 56,400
acres. While Amfac is Hawaii's largest landowner, the No. 2 slot is
held by Castle & Cooke, which through its Dole food company is the
world's largest pineapple producer.
   Some analysts said that Amfac's buyout offer does not adequately
take into account the value of the company's Hawaiian property.
   Amfac spokeswoman Deborah Demer had no comment on whether Castle
& Cooke was among the bidders for the company.
   Amfac is a diversified services company with main lines of
business in food processing, hotels and resorts, retail,
agriculture and property. It reported revenue of $2.2 billion last
year. The company's principal executive offices are located in
Honolulu.

   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. said Monday its
second-quarter profit slipped 4.3 percent from a year ago when it
reported a gain on the sale of facilities.
   The tire-maker said it earned $134.9 million, or $2.35 a share,
in the three months ended June 30, compared with a profit of $141
million, or $2.47 a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 10.3 percent to $2.79 billion from
$2.53 billion a year earlier.
   Goodyear's 1987 results included $13.6 million from the sale of
its plant in Zaire and some properties in Arizona along with the
abandonment of a joint venture with Toyobo of Japan, said Goodyear
spokesman John Perduyn.
   The company sold the properties to raise capital to fend off a
hostile takeover bid by Sir James Goldsmith in late 1986, he said.
   Without income from the facilities sales, Goodyear's net
earnings would have risen 5.9 percent over the second quarter last
year, said Goodyear Chairman Robert E. Mercer.
   Goodyear said its operating income in its tires and related
transportation products business rose 3.6 percent on a sales gain
of 9.8 percent.
   The company said its industrial rubber, chemical and plastic
products segment also reported improved results.
   For the first six months of the year, Goodyear reported its net
income fell 45.9 percent to $230.2 million, or $4.02 a share,
compared with $425.2 million, or $6.63 a share, a year earlier. The
1987 results included $201.1 million from discontinued operations
and the $13.6 million from sales of facilities.
   Six-month revenue rose 11 percent to $5.33 billion from $4.80
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Soybeans, Corn Futures Plummet In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures plunged their permitted
limits in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in
reaction to scattered showers over the weekend and forecasts for
rain today in the eastern Midwest.
   Crop futures opened slightly lower, then plummeted after the
November soybean contract slipped below last week's low of $8.15 a
bushel, analysts said.
   The limit losses of 10 cents a bushel for corn and 30 cents a
bushel for soybeans suggested soybean futures may extend to six
days the sharp decline that began a week ago.
   Crop experts say the recent Midwestern rains have been too
spotty to cause great improvement in the drought-damaged corn and
soybean crops ``but the market's perception is that the situation
is much better than it was,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Certainly, the markets are reflecting a concern that the crop
is making a major recovery,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 7 cents to 13} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.71 a bushel; corn was 8}
cents to 10 cents lower with September at $3.02{ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to the limit 10 cents lower with September at $2.50{
a bushel; soybeans were 11{ cents to 30 cents lower with August at
$8.00{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .45 cent higher with August
at 65.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent lower to .18
cent higher with August at 77.00 cents a pound; hogs were .62 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with August at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1 cent lower to .03 cent higher with August at
37.80 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Friday while pork futures were
mixed.

   At the research and development offices of these
automakers, pushing a test car to the limits means giving it a good
shove around a 20-foot plastic proving ground.
   In the U.S. toy car industry, Matchbox Cars U.S.A. is one of the
Big Three. Last year, the Moonachie, N.J.-based company sold 77
million vehicles _ more than Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and
General Motors Corp. put together.
   The other members of the tiny Big Three _ Mattel Inc., maker of
Hot Wheels, and the upstart Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., maker of Micro
Machines, are heavy hitters in a business devoid of controversy and
lawsuits.
   ``We've never had a recall, we have no smog problems, no safety
problems,'' said Larry Wood, Mattel's top designer of Hot Wheels
cars.
   Wood spent three years designing cars for Ford Motor Co. in
Dearborn, Mich., in the 1960s before joining the Hawthorne,
Calif.-based Mattel and downsizing his designs for the pint-size
customer.
   ``When I worked in Detroit, I did a few door handles and tail
lights. So far, I've done every Hot Wheels car since 1968,'' he
said.
   These days, Wood is designing Hot Wheels' 1990 line, trying to
anticipate the car buyers' desires nearly as far into the future as
Detroit automakers.
   ``I think they have gone a little more conservative in the last
few years. Now kids seem to like the standard sporty cars,'' he
said.
   To anticipate designs, Woods sifts through automotive trade
magazines that often offer an advance peek of what Detroit, Tokyo
or Stuttgart plan to offer in upcoming model years.
   ``If Detroit or Japan or Germany come out with an exciting car
or different profile, we take a look at it,'' Wood said.
   Matchbox was so taken by Ford's Taurus-Sable design, that it
copied the new-age look for its 1-64 scale die-cast miniatures.
   ``If we see a trend developing in auto design, we will stay with
the trend and capture it in our cars,'' said Jim Walsh, Matchbox
marketing director. ``Obviously, the Ford Taurus is a pretty sleek
design and its something that's caught on with the public.''
   In September, South San Francisco, Calif.-based Lewis Galoob
will offer toy cars that change color in the sun. The new option
strays slightly from Galoob's philosophy of keeping its Micro
Machines realistic.
   ``Kids are not crazy for fantasy,'' marketing manager Marjorie
Forrest said. ``They don't want a car that doesn't look like a car.
Kids today are very sophisticated. They know what a (Lamborghini)
Countache is and what a Rolls Royce is.''
   Galoob expects to sell 45 million vehicles in 1988, just its
second year in the market. Its Micro Machines are about 1\ inches
long, smaller than Hot Wheels or Matchboxes, Forrest said.
   Sports cars and military and construction vehicles are the hot
sellers among the rug-running set.
   ``Basically, kids like things that are power oriented. The
feeling of speed or power is what kids gravitate to,'' said
Matchbox's Walsh.
   Adults and children apparently split the purchases evenly, said
Mattel's Wood, with children often choosing what they see on
television. For instance, a miniature version of the white Ferrari
Testarossa driven in ``Miami Vice'' is one of the most popular toy
sellers.
   The children show some loyalty toward American-made cars, Walsh
says, because that's what they often see on the streets. That
loyalty can carry over into their adulthood, he said.
   ``If they happen to like four-wheel-drive cars as a kid, there's
a strong possibility they'll like four-wheel vehicles as an
adult,'' Walsh said. ``In my opinion, if you like a particular type
of car as a kid, you're apt to grow up and like them.''
   That's good news for Detroit automakers, who usually charge no
royalties to miniature automakers who replicate their cars.
   ``Anytime you get your product in the mind of the car buyer or a
young person, you enhance your reputation,'' said Chrysler
spokesman B.F. Mullins.
   ``We think it does a lot of good. You get involved in a lot of
shelf space in department stores. It also gets young people
involved in your product. The bottom line is consideration of your
product.''
   When Chrysler introduced its Caravan and Voyager minivans, it
passed out Matchbox versions to the press as souvenirs, Mullins
said.
   Ford officials review miniatures modeled after their cars to
make sure they measure up.
   ``We want it (a toy) to be very authentic,'' Ford spokesman Dave
Krupp said. ``We want it to be accurate in every detail. We
consider this child a future car buyer.''
   And while children are the primary market, collectors also make
up small fragment of their sales. Walsh says there are about 20,000
Matchbox collectors in the country, who trade and sell vehicles,
some worth up to $200 each.
   Overall, the miniature car industry is cruising steadily.
   ``This is a field that is growing. But do not expect dramatic
growth from one year to the next,'' said David S. Leibowitz, a toy
industry analyst for American Securities in New York City.
   The cars usually take nine months to get from the drawing board
to production, which is usually performed at mini assembly lines in
the Orient, Wood said.
   Before they reach full production, the miniature car makers
often have groups of kids rate them and describe what they like
about a particular model.
   If a vehicle makes the grade, it's down to the test track, where
executives can briefly escape the pressures of business and test
ride their product.
   ``We have little tracks down in (research and development),''
said Matchbox's Walsh. ``It's a plastic track. We shoot them around
and have fun with them.''

   When he was about 12 years old, James Gibbons
figured he was too old to play with toy cars. When he turned 28, he
realized maybe he wasn't.
   The 38-year-old Gibbons is one of about 6,000 members worldwide
of Matchbox toy car collectors groups. The members trade, buy and
sell the small-scale replicas of vehicles ranging from the Ferrari
Testarossa to a Caterpillar earth mover.
   ``If you do it right, you can probably accumulate a little bit
of wealth,'' said Gibbons, a high school teacher.
   ``My mom and my wife are working for me at rummage sales. I have
a network of people working for me,'' he said.
   Gibbons figures the most valuable piece in the 700-vehicle
collection is worth about $50.
   ``I'd categorize (the collection) in the infant stages based on
what I've seen at the shows,'' he said.
   The smallest Matchbox cars sell for about $1.10 in hobby stores.
Each year, Gibbons says he acquires Matchbox's new line of cars,
usually about 12, and a few older models missing from his
collection.
   Gibbons is a member of the Matchbox International Collectors
Association of North America, based in Waterloo, Ontario. The 900
club members receive the organization magazine every two months and
meet annually.
   ``You get all types. They come from all walks of life,'' said
Rita Schneider, membership secretary. ``A lot of the gentlemen are
older and maybe they remember (the cars) from childhood.''
   The other North America collectors organization, Matchbox
U.S.A., based in Durham, Conn., has about 1,400 members who receive
a monthly magazine and meet annually.

   For Shirley Puryear, the road to joining
the Rothschilds and the Gallos began with a batch of homemade plum
wine.
   The home brew _ made with directions from a $1.99 book, a
five-gallon jug and some plastic tubing _ was terrible, said the
co-owner of the award-winning Bonair Winery.
   Things have improved quite a bit since then, and the Puryears
are among several small family winemakers in Washington who compete
for shelf space and medals with corporate giants like Chateau Ste.
Michelle, the state's largest.
   ``It's so much fun and so romantic,'' Mrs. Puryear, a former
social worker in California, said recently. ``This has surpassed my
wildest dreams.''
   Some of the family winemakers are hobbyists that barely break
even, but others are trying hard to make a living at it.
   ``The glamour fades fast once you get into the business,''
admitted Tom Campbell, owner of Horizon's Edge Winery in Zillah,
nestled in the rolling countryside near Yakima, Wash.
   Start-up costs for small wineries average about $270,000, and
competition is fierce for supermarket and wine list space.
   About seven of the state's 70 wineries produce under 2,083
cases, or 5,000 gallons, per year, according to the Washington Wine
Institute.Most of those under 5,000 gallons are family wineries,
said Simon Siegl, director of the trade group.
   By contrast, giants like Chateau Ste. Michelle produce about
500,000 cases per year and enjoy national distribution.
   Washington is the nation's third largest winemaker, after
California and New York, but is far behind California's 700
wineries.
   Washington winemakers have a history of cooperation, spurring a
growth from 11 wineries in 1977 to the present 70. The roots of
many wineries are intertwined.
   For instance, Mike Conway, owner of Latah Creek Wine Cellars in
Spokane, originally moved up from California to help open Worden's
Washington Winery. Then he helped start Hogue Cellars of Prosser
before securing financial help from the Hogues to launch Latah
Creek in 1983.
   ``The financial help was in exchange for my winemaking at Hogue
Cellars,'' said Conway, whose winery produces 15,000 cases a year.
   There are many similar stories, because it's an expensive
business to get into.
   ``It's a good way to make a small fortune out of a large one,''
said Campbell, who also owns Montana's Mission Mountain Winery, the
only one in that state.
   ``If your total end is to make money, this is not the business
to be in,'' said Campbell, one of several alumni of the winemaking
program at the University of California-Davis who operate in the
state.
   Horizon's Edge, which opened in 1985 and produces 2,500 cases a
year, is approaching $100,000 in annual sales, he said.
   ``I could make more money on the capital in CDs,'' he said.
   Campbell has also worked for Chateau Ste. Michelle, Stewart
Vineyards and Tucker Cellars in Sunnyside and Blackwood Canyon in
Benton City.
   ``I decided I better carve a niche for myself while I still
could,'' said Campbell, a native of Missoula, Mont.
   Like most of the small wineries, his major market is in state,
with many of the sales to visitors in the tasting room.
   ``Everyone who comes through is having fun,'' said Mrs. Puryear
of the often raucous mix of visitors to Bonair's tiny tasting room.
``It's not like buying asparagus at Safeway.''
   The tasting room is an important fixture in the small wineries,
because up to 80 percent of the product is sold there _ especially
by those that do not have wide distribution.
   ``We get hundreds of people per week here in the summer,'' Mrs.
Puryear said, even though the room can hold less than a dozen at
one time.
   ``We get people in here who own wineries in France or a local
who drops by carrying a can of beer,'' she said.
   Her tasting room has maps of the United States and the world,
with pins showing the states and countries of visitors. Delaware is
the only state without a pin.
   ``The first person from Delaware will get a bottle of free
wine,'' she said. ``Our choice.''
   Owners of Washington's family wineries, some of which produce
considerably more than 5,000 gallons, come from a variety of
backgrounds. For instance:
   _John Williams and Jim Holmes, owners of Kiona Vineyards in
Benton City, are engineers on the Hanford nuclear reservation, a
federal plutonium-making facility.
   _Dave Staton, owner of Staton Hills and a pioneer in wine
exports to Japan and Taiwan, founded the Wapato winery a decade ago
after working as an attorney and as an executive for TWA.
   _Michael and Patricia Manz, a child psychiatrist and teacher,
respectively, began Mountain Dome Winery in Spokane four years ago.
They make champagne exclusively and don't plan to market any of
their product until 1992.
   _Dr. George Stewart of Sunnyside established Stewart Vineyards
in 1983.
   Ray Small of Walla Walla, half owner of the highly-regarded
Woodward Canyon Winery, says winemaking is more profitable than
raising hogs.
   Small put up the money when his son, Rick, wanted to go into
winemaking in 1981 and they produce up to 8,000 gallons per year.
The winery is actually a metal building on their farm that
originally served as a truck garage and paint shop, he said.
   ``We've got four or five operations here and some of them are
hurting pretty good, like the wheat business and the hog
business,'' Ray said. But the winery is ``in the black.''
   Winemaking has an attractive, sophisticated image, but
Washington owners say the life isn't quite like ``Falcon Crest,''
the television series about intrigues in California's wine country.
   ``Everybody asks about (Falcon Crest),'' said Mrs. Puryear. ``I
watched one episode and they stuck a body in a wine tank.
   ``It's not like Falcon Crest,'' she said.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mellon Bank Corp. today announced a
refinancing program of approximately $1 billion, including $525
million in new equity capital and the sale of lower-quality assets
to a new, limited-purpose national bank.
   Mellon said its lower-quality assets will be reduced by about $1
billion. After the sale, Mellon said its exposure to the assets
will be limited to its $100 million investment in the new bank.
   Mellon said its plan calls for creation of a liquidating
national bank, independent of Mellon Bank Corp., to be called Grant
Street National Bank. The bank will not take deposits.
   Mellon Bank's headquarters is on Grant Street, Pittsburgh.
   Mellon said it will create the new bank by distributing common
shares of Grant Street National Bank to its common shareholders. It
said the new bank will acquire Mellon's low-quality assets from
public sale of up to $450 million of bonds to be underwritten by
the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   Mellon said the sale of assets and the financing for the new
bank are expected to occur in the third quarter and are dependent
upon approvals from bank regulators.

<HEAD>Reuters Posts 24.3 Percent Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reuters Holdings PLC, the information services
group, said Monday its half-year net profit rose 24.3 percent over
a year ago as its financial information and dealing services
continued to grow vigorously.
   However, revenue from trading room systems fell sharply as
investment companies implemented sharp cutbacks, Reuters said.
   Reuters said its net profit for the six months ended June 30
came to 63.4 million pounds, or $108.4 million, or 15.1 pence a
share, compared with 51 million pounds, or 12.2 pence a share, in
the same period a year ago.
   Reuters said its revenue rose 17.7 percent to 471.4 million
pounds from 400.4 million pounds.
   The company did not give out quarterly results. It is not
required to release them under British law.
   The company, which owns the Reuters news agency, said revenue
growth was curbed by the strength of the pound and a decline in
contributions from trading room systems.
   Glen Renfrew, Reuters' managing director and chief executive,
said a slowdown in orders for trading room systems was mostly the
result of cutbacks in investment firms in New York and London.
   But orders from Japan were excellent and orders from continental
Europe were good, he said.

   The stock market gave ground today, extending
last week's decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 68.46 points
last week, lost another 3.56 to 2,057.43 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 515 up, 749 down and
502 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 140.57 million shares at
noontime, against 82.44 million at the same point Friday.
   More than half that activity came in just two issues _ Southern
Co., up \ at 22}, and Pinnacle West, unchanged at 25.
   Analysts said both were the targets of large-scale trading
strategies based on the companies' impending dividend payments.
   Otherwise, brokers said traders were still put off by worries
over inflation and fears of a continuing rise in interest rates.
   The government is due to report Wednesday on the gross national
product for the second quarter. If the figures show persistent
strong growth in business activity, as many analysts expect, they
could raise fresh fears of upward pressure on interest rates.
   In addition, brokers said, morale on Wall Street was generally
low after the market's weak performance last week.
   Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down | at 50{;
General Electric, down [ at 41[, and Philip Morris, down [ at 88.
   Compaq Computer rose | to 59] in active trading. The company
reported higher profits for the second quarter.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.22 to 149.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .61 at 305.50.

<HEAD>Rubik's Cube Creator Launches A New Invention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hungarian professor who frustrated millions
with his ``Rubik's Cube'' is introducing his latest mind-twister _
a puzzle he says even he hasn't even solved, a spokeswoman for the
toy company marketing the product said Monday.
   But Erno Rubik's failure has not arisen from a lack of ability,
merely a lack of time to puzzle out the secrets of Rubik's Clock,
said Melanie Bateman of Matchbox Toys Ltd.
   ``Really, it's not because it's impossible, he's just too busy
to take the time to do it,'' she said, adding that the new toy will
be launched at a major London toy store Saturday.
   Rubik, 44, a professor of architecture and design at the Academy
of Arts and Crafts in Budapest, invented the mult-colored Rubik's
Cube as a teaching aid.
   After the success of the cube, which sold over 120 million units
worldwide, he founded a private business, Rubik's Studio, in
conjunction with the Hungarian government.
   The studio has produced Rubik's Magic, another toy puzzle, and a
series of products with business applications.
   His new toy requires a player to get 18 clocks on both sides of
a plastic disc to strike midnight simultaneously by twisting wheels
which turn some of the hands but not others, according to Ms.
Bateman.
   Speaking of his latest invention, Rubik warned in a press
release: ``Don't cheat by being taught how to do it by someone
else. It is much more satisfying to decode the puzzle on your own.''
   ``It is important to remember that your brain needs to be kept
in shape ... my new puzzle can help because it enables you to focus
entirely on finding the formula which, although it may seem
frustrating at the time, will do you good,'' he added.
   Rubik's Clock will retail for about $12, Ms. Bateman said.

<HEAD>Chrysler, UAW Local 72 Sign Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto
Workers signed a contract Monday covering workers affected by the
scheduled end of auto production in Kenosha and the closing of the
stamping plant in Milwaukee.
   Marc Stepp, UAW vice president and director of its Chrysler
department, said he hoped there would be ``life after current
production'' which is scheduled to end in December at the former
American Motors Co. plant in Kenosha.
   ``We hope this will not be the end of this operation. It is our
hope that it does continue,'' Stepp said.
   The agreement covers 5,500 workers in Kenosha and 450 at the
stamping plant, which already has closed.
   Stepp said he was particularly happy about the commitment in the
contract calling for Chrysler to pay back AMC profit-sharing that
AMC had promised members of UAW locals 72 and 75 in exchange for
concessions.
   Chrysler acquired the Kenosha car-making plant and the Milwaukee
stamping operation when it bought AMC last year. Chrysler initially
planned to keep the plant open for several years, but then
announced it did not need the production capability.
   Anthony St. John, vice president for human resources at
Chrysler, also cited provisions in the pact calling for worker
benefits to continue for up to two years after the layoffs and to
allow special early retirements for some senior workers.
   St. John said the decision to stop building cars in Kenosha as
of December stands.
   When asked if there was any chance of it continuing into 1989,
St. John said, ``I would suggest that the answer is no to that.''
   St. John said the company projects that the produced in Kenosha
at a separate plant that employs about 800 workers will be needed
through 1992. But he said it is possible that plant could close
before that.
   ``However, it certainly is not likely,'' he said.

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A think tank has been given 10 months to
answer a question that has concerned consumers and plagued
philatelists since the dawn of postal automation: Why won't stamps
stick?
   Battelle Memorial Institute, which recently received a $700,000
contract from the U.S. Postal Service, convenes a meeting here
Thursday in hopes of making a sticky situation stickier, said Don
McDowell, general manager of the stamp division of the U.S. Postal
Service in Washington.
   About 100 representatives of adhesive manufacturers and paper
companies expected to attend the one-day meeting will be asked to
share their thoughts and, in some cases, their secret formulas.
   ``I don't think $700,000 is too much to pay for a stamp that
sticks,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Compare that to the
fact that stamps are an $8 billion-a-year business.''
   The Columbus-based institute is trying to find a perfect stamp
glue _ one that not only will keep stamp and envelope together from
the point of origin to destination, but will taste a little better,
McDowell said.
   ``The public insists that it at least, if it can't stick, not
taste so bad,'' he said. ``The problem is finding a consensus on
what tastes good. Some people like liver, others don't. So it's got
to be something that may not taste great, and may not taste like
anything at all.''
   He said consumers have repeatedly suggested more flavorful glues
that taste like cherry, vanilla and vodka.
   ``Oh, they have suggested it, but I hardly think vodka would be
appropriate,'' he said, laughing. ``No, Jerry Falwell, we're not
planning on that at all.''
   Neither McDowell nor Battelle consider the issue a laughing
matter.
   ``Sure, people giggle. But it's not very funny to us. It's very
important to us, and to the people who want their letters to reach
their destinations,'' McDowell said.
   He said Battelle's task will not be easy.
   ``Do you have any idea how many adhesives there are in the
world?'' he said. The Postal Service uses three kinds of adhesives
now, which McDowell describes as ``shiny, not shiny and halfway in
between.''
   He could not estimate how many stamps are lost in transit every
year, but said the problem has gotten worse since the Postal
Service began to automate in the early 1970s.
   ``Before then, when it was manual, the impact to a stamp was
like a car hitting a brick wall at 5 mph. Now, it's like a car
hitting a brick wall at 60 mph. Because these machines accelerate
and decelerate so fast, when the envelope stops, the stamp doesn't
want to,'' he said.
   Slowing the machines won't fix the problem, he said. The rising
volume of mailed items means the system will have to speed up.
About 35 million stamped items move through the system every year.
   The American Philatelic Society, an organization of stamp
collectors, has argued that not only is the adhesive not sticky
enough, it also eats through the paper, which decreases a stamp's
value.
   One philatelist does not agree that a new glue is needed.
   M.W. Martin of the Topical Philatelic House in Columbus says the
glue is not the culprit. He blames the disappearing stamp dilemma
on human error and sorting machines that are not stamp-friendly.
   ``I'm in this business 40 years and I just don't see the
non-sticky problem. If they fall off sometimes, it's not the glue.
People aren't licking them enough, the envelope maybe has some dust
on it. I think the real problem is the machines at the post
office,'' he said.

<HEAD>Japanese Beginning to Spend their Yen on Luxury Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese are breaking with a tradition of
frugality to bring some luxury into their lives _ big cars,
European furniture, diamond jewelry.
   The government has been urging them to spend the yen they
ordinarily put in the bank, in hopes of spurring the domestic
economy.
   Analysts say skyrocketing property values, easy credit, price
stability and the yen's rise in value are generating a fast-growing
market for luxury goods _ a turnaround from three years of slumping
consumption when the surging yen subdued the export-driven economy.
   ``Selling well are expensive and luxurious durable goods such as
large-size TV sets, refrigerators, furniture and dining ware
imported from Europe,'' said Mitsuhiro Hirose of the Sales
Promotion Division at Matsuya Co., a major department store on
Tokyo's bustling Ginza.
   A recent Bank of Japan report called brisk personal buying a
``key element'' of Japan's current economic success. The government
has cut income taxes and launched a 5-trillion-yen ($40 billion)
public spending program, spurring housing starts. The bank cut its
discount rate to a record low 2.5 percent, and the public Housing
Loan Corp. trimmed more than a percentage point off its interest
rate, currently 4.35 percent.
   Consumer demand as measured by department store sales jumped 8.2
percent in April from a year earlier, according to the Japan
Department Stores Association. Total sales by 254 major department
stores last year rose an average 4.7 percent every month, the
association said.
   And the gross national product, which measures total output of
goods and services, grew at an annualized rate of 11.3 percent in
the first quarter of this year, figures from the Economic Planning
Agency indicate.
   ``People regard expensive, new products as a means of being
somewhat different from others,'' said Takayuki Ikeda, manager of
the Consumer Electronics Product Division at Mitsubishi Electric Co.
   In 1985 the company began marketing its 37-inch color television
set, the industry equivalent of 35-inch American models, for
478,000 yen ($3,825).
   ``At first we never thought a large-sized TV with a built-in
picture tube would be accepted in Japanese homes, which some
Europeans have ridiculed as `rabbit hutches','' Ikeda said in an
interview, ``but the opposite is true. People have realized that
the larger the TV screen, the more fun they can have, the more
feeling of real ambience.''
   Japanese bought 9.6 million color TV sets last year, 20 percent
of which measured 22 inches or larger, up 12 percent from 1986,
according to industry figures.
   Automakers are benefiting from the Japanese who now want bigger,
more expensive cars. Toyota Motor Co. in April sold 14,673 of its
large-size, 4.6-million-yen ($37,000), top-of-the-line Crown models
_ a 92.5-percent jump from a year earlier.
   ``People's sense of money has become accentuated,'' said Isao
Takayama, chief of the jewelry division at the swank Mitsukoshi
department stores. ``Several years ago you could buy a house for 50
to 60 million yen. Now it costs up to 500 million yen ($4 million).
It tends to dull people's sense of money.''
   Reflecting a demand for expensive ornaments, imports of polished
diamonds rose 61.6 percent to 1.06 million carats in the first four
months of this year over last year, according to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
   Takayama said the hottest items are diamond rings priced at 2
million yen ($16,000).
   ``Nowadays customers come in asking to see diamonds of about 100
million yen ($228,000),'' he said. ``Four or five years ago, that
was the stuff of dreams.''

   Prices fell Monday in quiet trading on the London
Stock Exchange as the market awaited British economic reports due
later in the week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 6.3
points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,838.5, after sinking as low as 1,826.7
shortly after the opening.
   Volume was a meager 288.4 million shares, compared with 402.6
million shares traded Friday.
   Some traders said they were encouraged by the market's ability
to claw back from its initial decline of 18.1 points.
   The early declines came as the pound strengthened and stock
prices had fallen Friday in New York and earlier Monday in Tokyo.
   ``We're ticking a bit better all the time,'' one equity salesman
said.
   But there was little news on which the market could trade,
traders said.
   The salesman cautioned that dealings would likely remain light
until release of British economic reports later in the week.
Britain's next trade report is due Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Shortly after the Tokyo Stock Exchange opened last
Tuesday, grim-faced Japanese businessmen began filing into the
lobby of Sanyo Securities Co. Ltd. in the Ginza shopping district
to track the market's performance.
   Their faces grew grim as a retreat that began the previous day
in response to a jump in the U.S. dollar's value quickly turned
into a rout.
   Before it was over, the market's barometer, the Nikkei Stock
Average of 225 issues, had lost 513.09 points, its biggest loss of
the year.
   After a brief rebound at mid-week, the decline resumed,
stripping more than 600 points from the average by week's end. On
Monday, the market rose 76.55 points at the opening bell, then
slumped again to finish down 117.81 at 27,183.53.
   While the declines pale in comparison to the calamitous plunge
of last October when New York markets set off a worldwide stock
market panic, they are worrisome nonetheless.
   Some Japanese economists view the latest decline as a warning
shot for the high-flying Japanese economy, and they caution that
the next ``Black Monday'' could be precipitated here.
   ``I think these are continuing signs of confusion over the
direction of the economy in Japan,'' said William P. Sterling,
senior economist for Merrill Lynch Securities Co. in Tokyo. ``These
are warning signals, and people are nervous.''
   Market analysts blamed the wave of selling on market shifts,
from steel and shipbuilding shares to electronics.
   Sterling said investors are trying to take their money into more
stable stocks, so they have a better chance of selling if the
market falls.
   ``When people have their eyes on the fire exit, they buy those
stocks,'' he said.
   The root of the concern appears to be the recent surge in the
dollar's value, which has moved above the psychologically important
level of 130 yen after a long decline. Some experts here also view
the recent increase in American interest rates as a precursor of
higher Japanese rates.
   The boost in the dollar sprang partly from an improvement in
American trade statistics, which show the imbalance between U.S.
imports and exports is shrinking. That shift _ while good news for
American industry _ threatens to divert the lifeblood of Japan's
boom, which has drawn its strength from a steady stream of exports
to the United States.
   ``The United States is seeing the high side of this process,''
Sterling said of the changing trade relationship. ``But its trading
partners are beginning to feel the heat. This is now beginning to
show a strain on the Japanese economy.''
   Sterling said there was so much growth last year that if the
Japanese economy had zero growth in 1988, it would still be 3.4
percent above a year ago.
   The Japanese government's leading index of economic indicators
fell two months in a row, in March and April. A decline two months
in a row typically has meant a recession in Japan within four to
eight months.
   Industrial production was down 3.8 percent for April and May,
which portends zero or negative growth for the second quarter.
   Housing starts have been falling rapidly, following a boom last
year that raised real estate prices and cooled the enthusiasm of
prospective home buyers.
   The gloomy view is far from universal, however. Last week, a
group of 21 Japanese financial institutions issued a glowing report
on the state of the economy, saying growth through the fiscal year
was expected to be 4.4 percent to 5.4 percent.
   Teruhiko Mano, an economist for the Bank of Tokyo, said the
recent market swings are ``merely an adjustment, not an indicator
of recession.'' He also takes issue with the housing slowdown,
which he says is merely a reaction against prices that were too
high to begin with.
   ``The dollar went up, and the market went down,'' he said of the
stock market drop. ``Our economy is reacting to the capitalistic
system. It shows it is working well.''

<HEAD>Computer Firm's Income Jumps 91 Percent In 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp., enjoying higher than
expected orders for two new desktop computers, Monday reported a 91
percent jump in net income for the second quarter.
   Sales for the second quarter increased 71 percent compared to
the same period a year ago.
   The Houston-based firm on June 20 began volume shipments of two
new desktop computers and were met with stronger initial dealer
demand than any other product in the company's history, officials
said.
   ``Our solid second-quarter financial results reflect continued
strong worldwide demand for our high-performance, industry-standard
products,'' said Rod Canion, president and chief executive officer.
   Part of the increase was a non-recurring, pretax gain of nearly
$10 million that resulted from an increase in the carrying value of
the company's investment in Conner Peripherals Inc., which was
offered publicly for the first time during the quarter.
   During the second quarter of 1988, net income rose to $59
million, or $1.45 per share, on sales of $457 million from $31
million, or 80 cents per share on sales of $268 million a year ago.
   Compaq's gain from the Conner Peripherals public offering
increased earnings per share by about 15 cents in the period,
officials said.
   Net income for the first six months of 1988 was $105 million, or
$2.66 per share, compared with $51 million, or $1.36 per share, in
the first half of 1987. Sales totaled $896 million up from $478
million.
   The company established a subsidiary in Belgium during the
second quarter, bringing to 43 the number of countries where Compaq
computers are available.

   The stock market drifted in a narrow range today
in an inconclusive session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 68.46 points
last week, recovered 3.38 to 2,064.37 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 561 up, 783
down and 530 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 175.84 million shares with two
hours to go.
   More than half that activity came in just two issues _ Southern
Co., up [ at 22|, and Pinnacle West, down [ at 24~.
   Analysts said both were the targets of large-scale trading
strategies based on the companies' impending dividend payments.
   Otherwise, brokers said traders were still put off by worries
over inflation and fears of a continuing rise in interest rates.
   The government is due to report Wednesday on the gross national
product for the second quarter. If the figures show persistent
strong growth in business activity, as many analysts expect, they
could raise fresh fears of upward pressure on interest rates.
   In addition, brokers said, morale on Wall Street was generally
low after the market's weak performance last week.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines rose ~ to
121; General Electric gained \ to 41{; Ford Motor dropped { to 50|,
and Philip Morris was unchanged at 88\.
   Postal Instant Press, traded on the American Stock Exchange,
dropped 2[ to 14}. The company said financing delays had occurred
in a planned buyout at about $17.41 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.07 to 149.32. At the Amex, the market value index was down 1.26 at
304.85.

   Braniff Airlines Inc. announced Monday
it would begin serving four new cities and expand service to 14
other cities from Kansas City International Airport beginning Sept.
12.
   The Braniff flights are expected to fill some of the void that
will be left Aug. 31 when Eastern Airlines cuts all but six of its
53 departures from the Kansas City airport.
   William G. McGee, Braniff's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said the planned expansion will increase
Braniff's daily departures from the Kansas City airport from 50 to
76.
   On Sept. 12, Braniff will add non-stop flights from Kansas City
to Boston, Houston, Oklahoma City and Philadelphia, McGee said at a
news conference.
   In its announcement on Friday, Eastern said that its failure to
get pay concessions from unions forced it to dismantle its Kansas
City flight-connecting hub, which was established in December 1983.

<HEAD>Posts 3.9 Percent Profit Increase in 2nd-Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.H. Robins Co. reported Monday that its
second-quartyer earnings rose 3.9 percent on an 11 percent sales
increase.
   The pharmaceutical manufacturer, which is operating with
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws, said its earnings were hurt by the accrual of
certain costs and expenses that it expects will be incurred as part
of its Chapter 11 reorganization plan.
   Robins earned $8 million, or 33 cents per share, in the three
months ended June 30, compared to $7.7 million, or 32 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   But the company said its earnings for the quarter would have
increased 130 percent without the Chapter 11 costs.
   Sales for the quarter rose to $202.6 million from $182.2 million
in 1987.
   Operating earnings for the second quarter were $24.8 million, up
2 percent from the $24.5 million in the comparable period last year.
   For the first six months of the year, Robins said it earned
$22.1 million, or 91 cents per share, down 34 percent from $33.7
million, or $1.40 a share, a year ago.
   Six-month revenue rose 9 percent to $428.7 million from $392
million a year earlier.
   Robins sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1985 as
injury claims mounted against its Dalkon Shield birth control
device.
   The company's reorganization, including a merger with the New
York-based American Home Products Corp., is expected to receive
court ratification later this summer.

   The Big Three automakers posted a 3.7 percent
increase on Monday in their daily domestic car sales in mid-July,

offset a slight decline at General Motors Corp.
   GM sold 106,791 cars in the July 11-20 period, up from 96,746 in

24,037 a year earlier and up 10.8 percent on a daily basis.
   Overall, the Big Three sold 205,786 cars, up from 176,469 a year

domestically produced autos, up from 874 in a period affected by
tooling changes a year earlier.
   Imported car and truck sales are reported at the end of each

   The dollar climbed higher at the end of trading in
Europe Monday, despite central bank intervention to hold it down,
dealers said.
   Gold prices fell more than $7 an ounce in London on what dealers
said profit-taking after last week's advance.
   Dollar trading was initially hectic Monday, dealers said. The
U.S. currency jumped sharply in Frankfurt, but was brought lower
when the West German central bank intervened to sell dollars, they
said.
   ``At present levels, there is new demand,'' a Frankfurt dealer
said.
   Dealers said they believed the dollar hit bottom late last week
and is heading for higher ground again.
   Some dealers in Frankfurt said the central bank may have
intervened partly to prop up the mark against the British pound,
which also strengthened against the West German currency Monday.
   Dealers in London said the pound continued to be buoyed by the
market's belief that Britain's relatively high interest rates are
unlikely to come down in the near future, putting the brakes on
inflation.
   But the British currency fell against the dollar. In London, the
British pound was quoted at $1.7265, compared with $1.7405 Friday.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Friday's rates,
included: 1.8452 West German marks, up from 1.8265; 1.5345 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5175; 6.2215 French francs, up from 6.1630;
2.0745 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0615; 1,359.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,353.75; 1.2075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.28 yen to a closing 131.80. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 132.08 yen.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $434.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $442.
   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid $437.50, compared
with $442.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 34 cents to close at a bid
$444.28.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $7.60 a troy ounce, compared
with Friday's $7.76.

<TEXT>
   Crop futures closed sharply lower Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that drought-stressed corn
and soybean fields were gradually recovering due to a wetter
weather pattern in the Midwest.
   Most contracts for future deliveries of corn and soybeans
plunged their permitted daily limits, 10 cents and 30 cents a
bushel, respectively. Soybeans for August delivery have skidded
more than $1.90 a bushel over six consecutive losing sessions.
   Light, scattered showers fell during the weekend and Monday in
the Midwest, continuing a pattern that developed in mid-July to
replace the unusually warm and dry conditions that had dominated
the region during the previous three months.
   ``There is certainly a lot of varying opinion over how much
benefit it may have done for the crop, but traders clearly are
responding to the fact that moisture exists, and that's a
significant departure from what we saw in April, May and June,''
said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   At the close, wheat was 6 cents to 13 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.71{ a bushel; corn was 7
cents to 10 cents lower with September at $3.02{ a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 7 cents lower with September at $2.54 a bushel;
soybeans were 21{ cents to 30 cents lower with August at $8.00{ a

<TEXT>
   Troubled food giant Pillsbury Co. named the head
of rival General Foods Corp. as its new top executive Monday, but
the announcement drew a negative reaction on Wall Street.
   Analysts said they were skeptical that Philip L. Smith, who
lacks solid experience in the restaurant business, would be able to
quickly turn around Pillsbury's flagging Burger King fast-food
chain as well as engage in tough competition to defend the
company's consumer food products.
   Echoing those concerns, Pillsbury stock fell $1.50 a share to
$35.37{ in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Smith, 54, has been chairman of General Foods, the nation's
largest food concern, and vice chairman of Philip Morris Cos. Inc.,
which acquired General Foods in 1985. He is to begin his new job
Aug. 1.
   He is taking over from William H. Spoor, who returned from
retirement to run Pillsbury on an acting basis nearly five months
ago when the previous chief executive was pressured to leave the
company.
   Minneapolis-based Pillsbury, the nation's fourth largest food
conglomerate, produces Green Giant vegetables, Haagen-Dazs premium
ice creams and Van de Kamp's frozen fish. In addition to the
5,500-unit Burger King chain, it also owns Steak & Ale and
Bennigan's restaurants.
   Separately, Pillsbury announced Monday it had agreed to purchase
Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc., a privately held San Diego-based producer
of canned seafood with annual revenue of $265 million. Pillsbury
also said it had decided to sell off its grain merchandising
division and use the proceeds to finance the Bumble Bee acquisition.
   In prepared statement, Spoor said that ``attracting a top-flight
chief executive has been a major priority.'' He called Smith ``a
gifted and capable leader (who) has the unanimous support of our
board of directors and the senior management.''
   Analysts have been critical of Pillsbury, saying it lacked clear
and vital leadership over the past few years.
   Its after-tax profit plummeted 62 percent in fiscal 1988 to
$69.3 million on sales of $6.2 billion, largely because of a
restructuring charge associated with the sale of the Godfather's
Pizza chain and a number of other restaurant operations and
consolidations.
   The restaurant unit, which accounts for nearly half of the
company's total revenue, reported a 5 percent drop in sales in the
fiscal year ended May 31 as Burger King continued to lose market
share to rival McDonald's Corp.
   ``Pillsbury's weakness has been more related to restaurants, and
if they got a guru in restaurants, they may have been better off,''
said Edward Froelich, an analyst at Pershing & Co.
   Pillsbury has been pouring as much as $200 million a year into
touting Burger King restaurants amid criticism that the advertising
campaigns were less than effective. The company also faces stiff
competition in its consumer foods business.
   Under Smith's leadership, General Foods also has suffered
lagging growth and earnings. ``You can't say his track record at
General Foods would lend itself to any wide-eyed enthusiasm,''
Froelich said.
   Much of General Foods' difficulites can be linked to its core
Maxwell House coffee business, which is suffering from lackluster
growth. But analysts point to other potential problems.
   ``Smith has been a big cheese in a company with a lot of easy
brands,'' said Stephen Carnes, a managing director at Piper Jaffray
& Hopwood in Minneapolis, referring to Oscar Mayer luncheon meats
and Jell-O brand gelatin.
   Because Pillsbury has few high-growth products, Smith ``will
have to get down to trench warfare, and he was never in that mode
before,'' Carnes said.
   While some analysts speculated that Philip Morris might be
unhappy with Smith's performance at General Foods, others suggested
Smith merely wanted to run his own show.
   Smith, a 22-year veteran of General Foods, said in a statement
that ``Pillsbury is a terrific company with fine businesses and
excellent people.''
   ``I'm looking forward to leading this company aggressively with
its exciting and challenging opportunities,'' he said.
   The 65-year-old Spoor returned to the helm at Pillsbury after
the ouster of John Stafford, whom Spoor had groomed as his
successor and who presided over Pillsbury's first earnings decline
in 16 years. Spoor had run the company from 1973 through 1985.
   Speculation had been swirling on Wall Street recently that
despite its difficulties, Pillsbury might be a takeover target.
   But analysts are divided as to how attractive a takeover
candidate Pillsbury may be. Carnes, for instance, said Pillsbury
had ``too many wrecks in the ditch right now.''
   Some people have said the Burger King chain could fetch as much
as $1.5 billion if it were spun off as a separate company, but
Carnes estimated the chain would bring only about $900 million
because it was at least two years away from a turnaround.
   Pilip Morris Chairman Hamish Maxwell issued a statement praising
Smith's tenure at General Foods and said Smith's position would not
be filled. Maxwell said the heads of the subisidary's domestic
foods, coffee and Oscar Mayer units would report directly to him.

<HEAD>Construction Will Slide 5 Percent in 1988, Forecast Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction contracts will decrease 5 percent
this year as the nation's continuing building slump is worsened by
a fall in housing starts, according to a private forecast issued
Monday.
   Construction contracts in 1988 are expected to total $246
billion, down from $257.62 billion last year, McGraw-Hill
Information Services Co. said.
   In its latest Dodge-Sweet's Construction Outlook, McGraw-Hill
predicted housing starts would tumble 9 percent to 1.45 million
units this year, with most of the drop coming from the apartment
sector. The contract value of housing construction is expected to
fall 3 percent, McGraw-Hill said.
   The housing situation could worsen if credit becomes more
expensive in reaction to inflationary pressures, the business
information company said in a news release.
   Overall construction has slumped this year because of several
years of overbuilding in the commercial and office markets,
McGraw-Hill said.
   The company forecasts the contract value of office building will
plunge 14 percent this year, while store and other commercial
building will drop 12 percent.
   The total value of non-residential construction contracts is
expected to fall 8 percent.
   Public works construction contracts are forecast to remain
steady, totaling $42.25 billion, in comparison with $42.44 billion
in 1987.

<HEAD>Troubled American Savings to Sell up to $2.5 Billion in CDs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ailing American Savings & Loan Association
plans to sell up to $2.5 billion worth of federally insured
certificates of deposit, a spokeswoman said Monday.
   The CDs will carry a federal guarantee that the full amount of
principal and interest will be paid through their maturity date
even if American Savings is put into receivership by the federal
government, said Layna Browdy, spokeswoman for Financial Corp. of
America, parent of the S&L.
   American Savings is the nation's second-largest thrift and is
the target of a rescue effort by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
The board has set an Aug. 1 deadline to negotiate a rescue by the
Robert M. Bass Group Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, that reportedly
will involve injection of money by the group and the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   The CDs will be sold through a group of Wall Street brokers led
by Merrill Lynch & Co., the spokeswoman said. A letter of assurance
from the FSLIC states that holders of brokered CDs would be paid on
schedule if the government put the thrift into receivership, Ms.
Browdy said.
   Often, time deposits are paid off all at once when an
institution is placed into receivership.
   Sale of the CDs could help stem an outflow of deposits at the
institution, but isn't a response to American Savings net deposit
outflow of $978 million in the second quarter, Ms. Browdy said. FCA
officials have been discussing such a sale internally for about a
year with the idea of attracting depositors from outside the area
covered by American Savings' California branch network, she said.
   The CDs will be sold in denominations of $1,000 with terms of
three, six, nine and 12 months. The timing and amount of the
initial sale hadn't been set, Ms. Browdy said, adding that the
total amount sold could total $2.5 billion over a period of time.

   Stock prices showed no clear trend today in a
session marked by scattered buying of blue chips.
   About half of the day's activity came in stocks that were the
targets of large-scale trading strategies based on the companies'
impending dividend payments.
   Otherwise, brokers said traders were still put off by worries
over inflation and fears of a continuing rise in interest rates.
   The government is due to report Wednesday on the gross national
product for the second quarter. If the figures show persistent
strong growth in business activity, as many analysts expect, they
could raise fresh fears of upward pressure on interest rates.
   In addition, brokers said, morale on Wall Street was generally
low after the market's weak performance last week.

<HEAD>McDonald and Quality Inns at Odds Over McSleep</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAYFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of fast-food giant McDonald's
Corp. testified Monday that Quality Inns International Inc. was
infringing upon its trademarks by using the name McSleep Inn for a
new chain of economy hotels.
   McDonald's took immediate exception last September to the use of
the ``Mc'' prefix after Quality Inns announced the new chain of
hotels, which will offer a night's lodging for $20 to $29.
   After repeated warnings from McDonald's to stop using the name,
Quality Inns filed suit against the international hamburger chain,
asking a federal judge to declare that McSleep does not infringe on
the chain's trademarks.
   McDonald's counter-sued Quality Inns, charging that use of the
``Mc'' prefix constitutes an infringement and that the public will
likely confuse the inns with McDonald's.
   ``We wanted to remove any cloud that was hanging over Quality,''
said Laurence Hefter, chief trial counsel for the lodging company
based at Silver Spring, Md. ``There's absolutely no likelihood of
confusion with McDonald's. The (McSleep) logo is very distinctive.''
   The McSleep logo is a variation on the Quality Inns logo of a
setting sun bordered by a black square, very distinct from
McDonald's golden arch, said Hefter.
   Hefter said the ``Mc'' prefix was selected because it connotes a
clear impression of value, affordable quality service. ``McDonald's
may have played a part in promoting that type of image, but we
believe that it has gone beyond that into the lexicon,'' he added.
   McDonald's began its defense Monday in the trial which began
July 18 before U.S. District Judge Paul Niemeyer.
   Roy T. Bergold Jr., vice president of advertising for
McDonald's, said the company spent more than $404 million last year
in advertising.
   In one of more than a dozen videotaped McDonald's commercials
presented in court Monday, the promotional character Ronald
McDonald taught children to put the prefix before many different
words, including Mc-fries, Mc-(milk) shakes and Mc-best.
   The purpose of the commercial was to create a Mc-language,
specifically associated with McDonald's, Bergold said.
   ``McDonald's is the largest single-brand television advertiser
in the country,'' he said. Surveys found that in the last four
weeks, 89 percent of the nation's children between 2 and
7-years-old have visited a McDonald's, and 96 percent of all adults
have visited a McDonald's at least once, Bergold testified.
   ``We're trying to establish the impact and awareness that
McDonald's has on the public, and why it's likely that they're
going to be confused'' by the McSleep chain, said Karen Kasander,
an attorney for McDonald.
   Chief trial counsel for McDonald's, former Maryland attorney
general Stephen H. Sachs, said a McDonald-sponsored survey
indicated that more than 30 percent of the participants associated
McSleep with McDonald's.
   McDonald's successfully sued the owner of a New York store
called McBagel. A federal judge ruled that the business community
generally recognizes that the ``Mc'' formative stands as a symbol
of McDonald's services and products.
   But Hefter said other company names not associated with food
bear the ``Mc'' prefix, including McThrifty and McLube.
   The McSleep Inns will offer a basic room with a bath, but no
pool, meeting rooms, food service or restaurant. Quality Inn, a
subsidiary of Manor Care Inc., hopes to franchise about 200 such
inns by 1991.
   Testimony in the trial is expected to end Wednesday.

   Phone solicitors beware. Bob Bulmash has got your
number.
   Bulmash makes repeat callers pay for his time. He has even taken
offenders to court and collected, and said Monday he's formed a
group to help others do the same.
   ``These big companies feel that they can cause this low-level
annoyance that (most) ... of the nation feels is an invasion of
their privacy,'' said Bulmash, 42, who works as a lawyer's
assistant.
   A nationwide telephone survey of 600 consumers found that 79
percent think telephone sales calls are annoying, said Barry
Schlanker, whose Schlanker Research Services in Linden, N.J.,
conducted the survey last year.
   Bulmash said he became fed up with such calls a couple of years
ago when a salesperson called and said, ```Hi. If you'd like to buy
a magazine subscription, we'll make a 12 percent gross donation to
Special Olympics.'''
   He started to offer a $5 donation ``when the guy says, `You
don't have to hang up on me. I'll just call the next guy,'''
Bulmash recalled.
   ``I called the Special Olympics and said, `What's going on?'
They assured me I'd never be bothered again,'' he said.
   But a year later, he got another call on their behalf.
   ``I'm not against Special Olympics. But I am for my privacy in
my home,'' Bulmash said.
   When phone solicitors call, he advises them, ``Any subsequent
calls from your company will be accepted on a for-hire basis for
the use of my personal property and time.''
   Bulmash said he warns he will charge $100 for their next call,
and so far, he said, he's collected about $250.
   One case involved Plan-O-Soft Water Conditioning Co. of nearby
Plano, Ill., which wanted Bulmash to buy a water conditioner.
   The Du Page County judge who heard the case ``stood up and he
said, `I was called recently and twice during the football game and
I'm sick of these things,''' Bulmash said.
   He won 97 cents _ the monthly cost of not listing his number in
the telephone book.
   ``It's not the money,'' he said. ``It's the fact that I as an
American citizen have rights.''
   Plan-O-Soft disagrees.
   ``I think that he's very unreasonable. I don't think he deserves
to have a telephone,'' said Delphine Malovich, the company's owner.
   ``We're not intruding on his privacy. All he has to say is he's
not interested and hang up the phone,'' she said.
   Plan-O-Soft has taken Bulmash's name off their customer list,
and when a new supervisor calls him by mistake _ which has happened
a few times _ they pay.
   ``I think the last time we just sent him a $7 check, and that
made him happy,'' Ms. Malovich said.
   In May, he formed Private Citizens Inc., designed to help
pestered people fight back. For $15, members can have their names
printed on a list to be sent to telemarketing companies, with a
warning that callers will be required to pay.
   To solicit membership, Bulmash plans _ what else? _ direct
marketing.
   But he'll use the mails, not the phone, and envisions a flyer
that reads: ``Junk Mail. Help stop junk phone calls.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Gold Falls on Deflationary Signals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply and gold prices skidded
to five-month lows Monday as the markets picked up signals that
inflation was easing.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $427.25 for a
troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $14.75 from late Friday's
$442. On New York's Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce of gold closed
at $425.90, down $16.30 from $442.20 late Friday.
   Monday's close was gold's lowest since it finished at $425 a
troy ounce on Feb. 29.
   Gold prices ``took a tremendous hit today,'' said Steven Pepper,
a vice president and bullion dealer at Republic National Bank.
   Last week, traders bought gold and silver heavily on rumors
about the silver miners strike in Peru. But Monday, there was
``panic selling'' as precious metals prices began to slip, Pepper
said.
   Randolph Donney, a research analyst with Elders Futures Inc.,
said the metals market reacted to a drop in commodities prices and
a rise in short-term interest rates. Both developments are believed
to be harbingers of a slowing in inflation, while precious metals
are considered a hedge during periods of higher inflation.
   Gold's decline began in the Far East and accelerated throughout
the trading day.
   In Hong Kong, the metal fell 34 cents to close at a bid $444.28.
It dropped $7.25 in London to close at a bid price of $434.75. And
in Zurich, it skidded to a bid $437.50, compared with $442.50 late
Friday.
   Silver was sharply lower on the Commodity Exchange in New York,
closing at $7.036, compared with late Friday's $7.606.
   In earlier London trading, silver was quoted at a late bid price
of $7.60, down from Friday's $7.76.
   Meanwhile, the possibility of lower inflation boosted the dollar.
   Jack Barbanel, a first vice president with Gruntal & Co. Inc.,
said the dollar gained its strength from the drop in commodities
prices, including the plunge in gold and silver.
   Robert Ryan, senior foreign exchange trader Irving Trust Co.,
said position squaring also contributed to the dollar's gains.
   In European trading, the dollar rose despite central bank
intervention to hold it down, dealers said.
   Overseas dealers said they believed the dollar hit bottom late
last week and is heading for higher ground again.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.28 yen to a closing 131.80. Later,
it was quoted at 132.08 yen in London and it rose to 132.175 yen in
New York from late Friday's 130.84.
   The British pound fell against the dollar. Sterling was quoted
at $1.7265 in London, compared with $1.7405 Friday, and it fell to
$1.7210 in New York from late Friday's $1.74225.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.84705 West German marks, up from 1.82775;
1.5380 Swiss francs, up from 1.5180; 6.2345 French francs, up from
6.1665; 1,363.75 Italian lire, up from 1,352.55; and 1.21475
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2009.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8452 West German marks, up from 1.8265; 1.5345
Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 6.2215 French francs, up from 6.1630;
2.0745 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0615; 1,359.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,353.75; 1.2075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983.

<HEAD>Mellon Shuffles Bad Loans To New Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mellon Bank Corp. said Monday it will shift $1
billion in bad loans into a new independent bank to stabilize
Mellon's earnings and improve its recently troubled finances.
   ``Last June, we said we'd deal with our problems as aggressively
as we could ... that we were not going to disembowel the company in
any form. This step is just a logical extension,'' said Frank V.
Cahouet, chairman of the bank holding company that ranked as the
nation's 16th-largest at the end of 1987.
   Mellon will raise $525 million in fresh capital for its own
operations, while infusing the new Grant Street National Bank with
$130 million in cash. In exchange, Mellon will retain $100 million
in preferred stock in the new bank and will pass along $30 million
in common stock to Mellon's shareholders as a dividend.
   The recapitalization plan is similar to one used by banks
experiencing severe financial problems, in which a portfolio of
problem loans are transferred to a separate ``bad bank'' while a
healthier parent bank retains the good loans, Cahouet said.
   This is the first time, however, that the ``good bank-bad bank''
approach has been adopted by a relatively healthy bank, Cahouet
told a news conference.
   Grant Street National will not take public deposits. It will
have its own own five-member board of directors, he said.
   Mellon last year reported losing $844 million because of
potentially bad loans in the energy-dependent Southwest and in
developing countries in South America.
   ``We could have managed the problems over the next three, four
or five years. Now at least we're saving all that time and we can
get on with developing the future of the institution,'' said Mellon
President Anthony Terracciano.
   Standard and Poor's Corp., the securities rating firm, said the
move will bolster Mellon's finances, help stabilize earnings and
free up managers.
   The new bank, whose name reflects Mellon's street address in
Pittsburgh, will buy the bad loans for $575 million in cash and
securities, a deep discount off their book value of $1 billion.
   Grant Street National will sell $425 million to $450 million
worth of high-yield, junk bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., an investment banking concern.
   Mellon will take a $200 million charge to third-quarter earnings
as a result of the deal, Cahouet said.
   Mellon's exposure to risk will be limited to the $100 million in
preferred shares it holds in the new bank.
   Mellon's $525 million in new capital will come from $275 million
in three series of preferred shares and $250 million in equity
purchase contracts from a group of investors.
   The $525 million will help meet anticipated funding guidelines
that bank regulators are expected to impose in 1992, Mellon
officials said.
   Bank officials said they expect to receive regulatory approval
for the recapitalization, which should be completed in the third
quarter.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices settled at a two-month low Monday after
falling for the sixth straight day on perceptions that a wetter
weather pattern was bringing a gradual recovery of drought-stressed
Midwestern crops, analysts said.
   Grain futures also finished sharply lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   On other markets, precious metals futures plummeted; cattle were
up while pork futures were down; energy futures fell; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   As rain puddles dried outside the Chicago Board of Trade, most
contracts for future deliveries of corn and soybeans plunged their
respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel.
   The August soybean contract has skidded $1.91 a bushel over six
consecutive losing sessions and finished Monday at $8.00{.
   Light, scattered showers fell during the weekend and Monday in
the Midwest, continuing a pattern that developed in mid-July to
replace the unusually warm and dry conditions that had dominated
the region during the previous three months.
   ``There is certainly a lot of varying opinion over how much
benefit it may have done for the crop, but traders clearly are
responding to the fact that moisture exists, and that's a
significant departure from what we saw in April, May and June,''
said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   But Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, disagreed with
weather-related explanations of the markets' behavior.
   Loewy cited last week's bullish long-range forecasts for a
return to hot, dry conditions in the Farm Belt and said: ``The
market is just not concerned about weather anymore.''
   He said Monday's sell-off probably was triggered by reports of
large build-ups of peanut oil and Malaysian palm oil, which compete
in the market with soybean oil.
   Traders also were said to have sold on rumors that the National
Weather Service's new 6-to-10-day outlook would predict continued
wet weather in the Midwest.
   That forecast, which was issued after the close, did indeed
predict above-normal rainfall in most of the Midwest during the
first five days of next week.
   Wheat settled 6 cents to 13 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.71{ a bushel; corn was 7 cents to 10
cents lower with September at $3.02{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents
to 7 cents lower with September at $2.54 a bushel; soybeans were
22{ cents to 30 cents lower with August at $8.00{ a bushel.
   The drop in crop futures helped trigger a collapse in precious
metals futures prices on New York's Commodity Exchange, analysts
said. Gold futures settled at their lowest levels since April 8,
1987.
   Investment demand for precious metals tends to rise and fall
with expectations for inflation, so analysts said the lower grain
futures, lower oil futures and Monday's stronger dollar all
contributed to the sharp decline in gold and silver futures.
   ``The fact that it was a fairly thin market (with relatively few
people trading) also contributed to it,'' said John Norris, chief
precious metals trader for Citibank in New York.
   Gold settled $16.30 to $18.40 lower with August at $426.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 57 cents to 62.8 cents lower with July at
$7.036 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, most cattle futures ignored
Friday's bearish quarterly cattle-on-feed report and settled higher
in line with higher cash markets, said Thomas Morgan, president of
Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Pork futures fell sharply in reaction to another USDA report
showing near-record numbers of pork bellies in cold storage, Morgan
said.
   Live cattle were .12 cent to .60 cent higher with August at
66.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .53 cent
higher with August at 77.75 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent to
1.30 cents lower with August at 45.52 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .85 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with August at
36.80 cents a pound.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 33 cents to 40 cents lower with September at
$16.05 a barrel; heating oil was .78 cent to .92 cent lower with
August at 44.17 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .85 cent to
1.04 cents lower with August at 51.22 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
with the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index up 1.18 points at 264.68.

<HEAD>FCC Threatens US Sprint With Sanctions Over Consumer Billing
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
indicated it may fine US Sprint Communications Co. unless the
long-distance phone company does a better job responding to
consumer billing complaints.
   Customer complaints about inaccurate, incomplete and late bills
have plagued the nation's third-largest long-distance company since
it was formed in July 1986 and have contributed to its losses.
   In a letter last week to US Sprint President Robert H. Snedaker,
the FCC said it was concerned about the volume of billing
complaints it has received from US Sprint customers and the
company's ``inadequate and inaccurate responses.''
   While other carriers have experienced billing complaints, they
usually correct the problem within two to three months, said the
letter, signed by Gerald Brock, the FCC's top telephone official.
   ``In US Sprint's case, however, various billing and related
problems have been occurring for well over a year,'' Brock said.
``These problems have been compounded by US Sprint's apparent
inability to promptly rectify complaints either when a customer
directly contacts US Sprint or when the customer contacts the
commission.''
   The FCC gave Sprint 20 days to explain the procedures it has in
place to investigate complaints forwarded by the FCC and what steps
it intends to respond to these complaints within the 30 days
required by law.
   US Sprint officials had no comment Monday on the letter.
Previously, the company has blamed the billing errors on computer
problems and has said it was bringing the foulups under control.
   Greg Vogt, chief of the FCC's telephone enforcement unit, said
the agency received 1,821 complaints against Sprint between Oct. 1,
1986, and July 14, but said ``we would be seeing the tip of the
iceberg of what Sprint sees'' in complaints directly from customers.
   During the same period, the FCC received 1,114 complaints
against American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and 494 against MCI
Communications Corp., he said.
   AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance company, says it serves
about 70 percent of the interstate long-distance market, while MCI
claims about 10 percent and Sprint about 6 percent.
   Vogt said the FCC, if not satisfied with Sprint's efforts to
make timely responses to complaints, could fine the company as much
as $2,000 per violation, up to a total of $20,000.
   Last week, GTE Corp. announced it was selling most of its 50
percent stake in US Sprint to its partner in the venture, United
Telecommunications Inc. United Telecom will raise its stake in US
Sprint to 80.1 percent early next year.
   US Sprint lost $138 million in the first quarter of 1988 after
racking up losses of $800 million last year. The two parents have
shared those losses equally.

<HEAD>Manville Reports Second Quarter Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. said Monday that its after-tax
profit slumped 19.5 percent in the second quarter because of
special charges related to asbestos clean-up costs and the shutdown
of a plywood operation.
   The building materials company said its net profit totaled $33.1
million, or $1.12 a share, in the April-June period, compared with
earnings of $41.1 million, or $1.45 a share, in the same 1987
quarter. Revenue rose 8.3 percent to $561 million from $517.8
million.
   For the first six months, profit fell 18.1 percent to $68.8
million, or $2.35 a share, from $84 million, or $2.97 a share, in
1987. Revenue rose 10.8 percent to $1.1 billion from $992.9 million.
   Manville said the $13.9 million after-tax charge primarily
covered removing asbestos from company property. It also included a
provision for the closing of a plywood operation at Manville's
facility in Huttig, Ark.
   Net earnings for the first six months of 1987 included a
one-time gain of $9 million from the sale of two real estate joint
ventures.
   ``While our overall operating performance remains strong, we
continued to experience severe competition in most construction
markets during the second quarter,'' said Tom Stephens, Manville
president and chief executive officer.
   Manville filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code on Aug. 26, 1982.
   The company's reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy
court judge on Dec. 22, 1986, and upheld by the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New York this past March. An appeal of the
approval is now before the Supreme Court.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anacomp Inc., a computer services
company, has reduced by $31 million to $383.9 million the price it
will pay to acquire disk-drive maker Xidex Corp., the companies
announced Monday.
   Indianapolis-based Anacomp, the nation's third-largest supplier
of micrographics products behind 3M Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.,
had announced July 12 that it would pay $10 for each of Xidex's
41.5 million outstanding shares.
   But Monday, the companies said that under a definitive agreement
approved by the boards of both companies, the new buyout price
would be $9.25 cash per share, reflecting further negotiations
since the initial agreement.
   Anacomp expects to begin a tender offer no later than Friday,
the company said.
   Xidex rose 12{ cents to $9 a share in national over-the-counter
trading Monday, while Anacomp fell 12{ cents to $9.12{ a share on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   In announcing the merger agreement earlier this month, Anacomp
had indicated that Xidex, based in Santa Clara, Calif., was well
managed and made a good business fit.
   Xidex, which has posted losses for two straight years due to
writeoffs on acquisitions, is a leading manufacturer of computer
data storage. It controls 25 percent of the world floppy disk
market and also makes computer output microfilm, microfilm readers
and reader printers.
   Anacomp, which employs more than 3,000 people, is a supplier and
manufacturer of services and products based on micro-imaging
technology known as micrographics.
   Xidex has 7,000 employees worldwide, about half in the San
Francisco Bay area at factories in Santa Clara, Sunnyvale and
Fremont. It also operates factories in Irvine; Omaha, Neb.; Iron
Ridge, Wis.; and Wales, Britain.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp., the nation's biggest oil company, said Monday its
after-tax profit rose 4 percent in the second quarter from a year
ago, while Mobil Corp., the No. 2 company, reported a 60 percent
surge in earnings.
   Amoco Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
Unocal Corp. and Ashland Oil Inc. also reported gains.
   Exxon said higher earnings in its refining and chemical
operations offset lower results from crude oil exploration and
production. Mobil also cited refining and chemical operations for
its gains as well as improvements in efficiency.
   Exxon, with headquarters in New York, had a net profit of $1.2
billion, or 90 cents a share, in the April-June period, which was
up from $1.15 billion, or 81 cents a share, in the same period of
1987. Revenue rose 7 percent to $21.63 billion from $20.16 billion.
   For the first half of the year, Exxon reported earnings of $2.66
billion, or $1.96 a share, up 20 percent from $2.22 billion, or
$1.56 a share, in 1987. Revenue increased 10 percent to $43.63
billion from $39.6 billion.
   Exxon Chairman L.G. Rawl said profit ``margins were stronger as
supply costs dropped and product prices firmed'' during the second
quarter. He also said increased demand for petroleum products
boosted sales volume in both the United States and abroad.
   Mobil, also based in New York, said its second-quarter profit
jumped to $487 million, or $1.18 a share, from $304 million, or 74
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent to $14.2
billion from $12.3 billion.
   In the first six months, Mobil's profit jumped 78 percent to
$992 million, or $2.41 a share, from $556 million, or $1.36 a
share. Revenue rose 17 percent to $28.1 billion from $24.0 billion.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray noted the strong earnings were
achieved during a period of relatively low crude oil prices, which
he said showed the ``balanced diversity'' of the company's business.
   On June 23, Mobil completed the sale of its Montgomery Ward
subsidiary for about $1.6 billion to an investor group including
senior management of the retailer.
   No. 5 Amoco, based in Chicago, saw its second-quarter earnings
soar 115 percent _ to $667 million, or $2.59 a share, from $311
million, or $1.22 a share.
   Revenue advanced 8 percent, to $6.2 billion from $5.7 billion.
   For the January-June period, Amoco's net income nearly doubled:
to $1.1 billion, or $4.41 a share, from $571 million, or $2.24 a
share. First-half revenue was up 9 percent, to $11.9 billion from
$10.9.
   Atlantic Richfield, which is based in Los Angeles and is the
sixth biggest U.S. oil company, attributed a 21 percent rise in its
earnings to the recent reorganization of its refining and marketing
operations.
   Arco's quarter profit rose to $400 million, or $2.19 a share,
from $330 million, or $1.80 a share, in 1987. Revenue rose 12.2
percent to $4.6 billion from $4.1 billion.
   In the first half of the year, the company earned $801 million,
or $4.39 a share, up from $569 million, or $3.11 a share. Revenue
increased to $9.2 billion from $7.9 billion.
   Occidental, ranked ninth and also based in Los Angeles, said its
profit in the quarter rose 30.5 percent to $77 million, or 34 cents
a share, from $59 million, or 23 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue
gained 9.3 percent to $4.7 billion from $4.3 billion.
   Occidental's first-half earnings increased to $190 million, or
85 cents a share, from $156 million, or 70 cents a share. Revenue
advanced to $9.2 billion from $8.5 billion.
   Unocal, also based in Los Angeles and ranked 13th, reported a 3
percent rise in second-quarter profit to $64 million, or 55 cents a
share, from $62 million, or 53 cents a share. Revenue rose 6
percent to $2.55 billion from $2.42 billion.
   In the first six months, Unocal earned $242 million, or $2.08 a
share, up from $123 million, or $1.05 a share. Revenue rose to
$4.85 billion from $4.48 billion.
   Ashland, an Ashland, Ky.-based concern that is the No. 14 oil
company, said its net income jumped 42.5 percent in the third
quarter of its fiscal year, rising to $57 million, or $1.02 a
share, from $40 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue increased 15.8 percent to $2.2 billion from $1.9 billion.
   For the nine months ended June 30, Ashland earned $149 million,
or $2.65 a share, up from $68 million, or $1.07 a share. Revenue
rose to $6.2 billion from $5.1 billion.

   Fleet-Norstar Financial Group said Monday it
has agreed to acquire Indian Head Banks Inc., a leading bank
holding company in New Hampshire, in an exchange of stock valued at
$240 million.
   The deal, which is subject to approval by regulators and
shareholders of Indian Head, calls for Fleet-Norstar to exchange
1.775 shares of its common stock for each of Indian Head's 4.7
million shares of common stock outstanding.
   The exchange ratio represents a price of about $44.37{ for each
Indian Head share, based on Fleet-Norstar's closing price of $25 a
share on Friday, the companies said in a statement.
   The exchange of Indian Head convertible preferred stock into an
equal number of Fleet-Norstar convertible preferred shares would
boost the total value of the deal about $240 million, the banks
stated.
   They said that price is approximately 1.7 times Indian Head's
book value per common share and is a 30 percent premium over its
market price, based on its close on Friday at $34.25 a share.
   Indian Head Banks, based in Nashua, has assets of about $1.8
billion; Fleet-Norstar's assets are about $25 billion.
Fleet-Norstar has dual headquarters in Providence, R.I., and
Albany, N.Y.
   Indian Head has 46 branches throughout New Hampshire and earned
$16.6 million in 1987, the company said.
   Peter D. Kiernan, chairman and chief executive of Fleet-Norstar,
said the proposed acquisition would be ``a major step'' in
expanding Fleet-Norstar's New England banking franchise.
   He noted that Fleet-Norstar already has four Norstar banks in
New York state, and operates Merrill-Norstar Bank in Maine, United
Bank in Connecticut and Fleet National Bank in Rhodse Island.
   J. Terrence Murray, president of Fleet-Norstar, said that after
the acquisition, it is expected that James Chandler will continue
as Indian Head's chairman and H.E. Harrington Jr. will continue as
its president and chief executive.
   Harrington said he expects the bank to operate ``as an
autonomous unit'' of Fleet-Norstar after the transaction is
completed. ``We do not see any significant cahnges for the next few
years,'' he said.
   Fleet-Norstar Financial Group is a diversified national
financial services company with about 1,000 offices in 40 states.

<HEAD>TV Producer Spelling in Deal with Cincinnati Billionaire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aaron Spelling, producer of TV's ``Dynasty,''
said he has made a $82.5 million deal with Cincinnati billionaire
Carl Lindner that would give Spelling a television distribution
company and Lindner a half-interest in Spelling's company.
   The transaction announced Monday revolves around Spelling's
cash-and-stock purchase of Worldvision Enterprises Inc.,
distributor of ``Love Boat'' and other TV shows, from Lindner's
Great American Communications Co.
   A new holding company, Spelling Inc., would be created to be
parent of Worldvision and of Spelling's present company, Aaron
Spelling Productions Inc.
   Spelling Inc. would pay $82.5 million in cash and Spelling stock
for Worldvision, with enough stock changing hands to give Great
American 50 percent of Spelling Inc., the companies said.
   The transaction would be mostly cash, said Spelling's executive
vice president, Ronald Lightstone, but he refused to disclose the
amount being considered.
   Lindner's Great American controls the company that bought Taft
Broadcasting Co. of Cincinnati, owner of seven television stations
and 15 radio stations, for $1.45 billion in October. Lindner, whose
personal fortune was estimated at $1 billion by Forbes magazine
last year, has a wide range of investments.
   The transaction announced Monday requires approval of
stockholders and regulators and was expected to close in three or
four months, Lightstone said.
   Shareholders in Spelling Productions, a publicly-traded company,
would get shares in Spelling Inc. on a one-for-one basis.
   Lindner, who owns about 4.5 percent of Spelling's 18.25 million
shares, would end up with half the shares in the new company after
issue of new common and preferred stock.
   Spelling is creator of ``Dynasty,'' ``Love Boat'' and ``Hotel,''
and plans a new fall series, ``Angels '88,'' similar to his earlier
``Charlie's Angels.''
   Worldvision distributes ``Barnaby Jones,'' ``Quincy,'' ``Little
House on the Prairie,'' and cartoons by Hanna Barbera, another
Lindner company.

<HEAD>Court Judgment Reduces Eaton Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eaton Corp. said Monday its second-quarter
profit fell by 29.5 percent from a year earlier, due mainly to a
charge taken to reflect a $17.6 million court judgment against the
company.
   Eaton posted after-tax profits of $46.6 million, or $1.87 a
share, down from $66.1 million, or $2.31 a share during the same
period last year.
   The latest quarter's earnings also included net income of
$700,000 from discontinued operations. The year-earlier quarter
included a $7 million gain from the sale of the company's polymer
products division.
   Quarterly sales were $886.3 million, up from $807.7 million
during the same period last year.
   The company said its net earnings from continuing operations
rose 2.9 percent during the period, to $63.6 million from $61.8
million.
   The California Court of Appeals last week affirmed a 1983 jury
award of $17.6 million against Eaton stemming from a 1976 lawsuit
that PKL Liquidating Trust filed against Cutler-Hammer, Inc., a
company Eaton bought in 1978. The lawsuit concerned PKL's minority
shareholding in Macrodata, which merged with Cutler-Hammer in 1977.
   Eaton said it is appealing the ruling to the California Supreme
Court.
   Eaton makes automotive, industrial, commercial and defense
products including truck transmissions, engine components,
electrical equipment and controls.
   For the first half of 1988, Eaton reported net income, including
discontinued operations, of $106.9 million, or $4.28 a share, down
15.3 percent from the $126.3 million, or $4.33 a share, in the same
period last year.
   Earnings on continuing operations were up 6.7 percent to $123.7
million, or from $115.9 million in the first half of 1987.
   Sales for the first six months of this year were $1.75 billion,
up from $1.58 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>York International Announces Antitrust Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YORK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department is investigating
the proposed merger of heating and air conditioning equipment
manufacturers SnyderGeneral Corp. and York International Corp.,
York announced Monday.
   SnyderGeneral, a Dallas, Texas-based company, has offered about
$795 million, or $61 per share, to acquire York.
   But in light of the inquiry, York's board reaffirmed its support
for an earlier $750 million, or $57.50 per share, buyout bid from a
group of investors backed by a unit of Citicorp, York said.
   York said the antitrust investigation presented risks of delays
and possible non-completion of its proposed acquisition.
   The length of the investigation into whether the SnyderGeneral
acquisition of York would violate antitrust laws could not be
determined, York said.
   Several weeks before the SnyderGeneral offer was made in
mid-June, York had agreed to be acquired by York Holdings Corp., a
new group capitalized by Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd. and other
investors.
   York Holdings is due to complete its tender offer for about 88
percent of the outstanding York shares by Friday, York said.
   More than a dozen suits have been filed by shareholders who are
attempting to block the Citicorp-led offer on the grounds the
$57.50 a share price is too low.
   SnyderGeneral is a privately-held company that employs about
4,800 people at nine facilities, including two in Europe.
   York International employs 1,600 people. It was a division of
Borg-Warner Corp. until it was spun off to stockholders in 1986.

   The company also said it was recalling 400 1987-88 model
Vanagons with alloy wheels and Semperit brand tires. The company
said improper tire mounting procedures used during the vehicle's
assembly may have caused the tire bead to crack, which could result
in a loss of air pressure.
   Volkswagen said it was unaware of any accidents related to
either recall.

<HEAD>Guild Drops Opposition to JOA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Newspaper Guild of Detroit, the only union at
the city's two largest daily newspapers, on Monday dropped
opposition to a proposal to partially merge the two publications, a
union official said.
   The decision came during a union meeting Monday morning and
after the union received concessions from the Detroit Free Press
during labor negotiations in three areas, said Don Kummer,
administrator of Local 22 of The Newspaper Guild.
   He said the Free Press had agreed to better pension language, a
retraining program for employees laid off if the proposed joint
operating agreement is approved and a cap on the number of Guild
members subject to such layoff.
   Knight Ridder Inc., owner of the Free Press, issued a statement
Monday welcoming the Guild's decision.
   ``The Guild thus joins the other five unions which originally
intervened in this proceeding, in urging approval of the JOA,'' the
statement said.
   The Free Press and the Detroit News asked the Justice Department
in 1986 for an exemption in antitrust law allowing them to merge
their business, advertising and circulation departments. Editorial
departments would remain separate.
   A spokesman for Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who must rule
on such exemptions, has said he plans to decide on the JOA sometime
before he leaves office Aug. 15.
   A Justice Department staff report and an administrative law
judge, who held hearings into the proposal, recommended the
arrangement be turned down.
   Knight-Ridder has said that if Meese rejects the request, it
would close the newspaper, with the loss of 2,200 jobs.
   The Free Press had 1987 circulation of 639,720 daily and 724,342
on Sundays, while circulation of the News was 678,720 daily and
839,319 on Sundays, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation.

<HEAD>Kimberly-Clark Profit Up 19.5 Percent In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kimberly-Clark Corporation said Monday its second
quarter net income was up by 19.5 percent from the same period last
year.
   The household, paper and personal care products company posted a
profit of $100.1 million, or $1.25 per share, compared with $83.8
million, or 96 cents per share, in second quarter 1987.
   Sales during the quarter rose to $1.34 billion from $1.22
billion.
   For the first six months of the year, net income rose to $193.4
million, or $2.41 per share, from $158.9 million, or $1.76 per
share, in the same period of last year. First half sales rose to
$2.6 billion from $2.4 billion a year earlier.
   Company officials said about 60 percent of the increase in
earnings came from outside the United States, where increased
competition resulted in increased advertising and promotional
expenses.
   The company also said its board of directors had adopted a
shareholder rights takeover defense, in order to discourage
potential unwanted buyout overtures.
   Darwin E. Smith, Kimberly-Clark's chairman and chief executive,
said he knew of no buyout offers during the second quarter.

<HEAD>Stocks Lower; Dollar Stronger In Tokyo Morning Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei closing, details, comments. No
pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices eased after an early surge Tuesday
morning in Tokyo and the U.S. dollar firmed against the Japanese
yen as market players awaited news of American economic growth
figures.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
117.81 points Monday, closed the morning session 46.78 points
higher at 27,230.31.
   The widely-watched market barometer gained almost 140 points
within minutes of the market's opening, but concern over U.S. gross
national product figures to be released Wednesday in Washington
erased most of the gain in thin trading, analysts said.
   Many investors stock market participants were taking a
wait-and-see attitude in advance of the report on second quarter
U.S. gross national product.
   ``If the U.S. GNP number is too strong, people are concerned
about inflation in the United States,'' said Hisamichi Sawa of
Prudential Bache.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar opened at 132.25 yen, up from
its 131.80 yen close on Monday, and was trading at around 132.45
yen by midmorning.
   ``Trading is directionless,'' said an exchange dealer, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
