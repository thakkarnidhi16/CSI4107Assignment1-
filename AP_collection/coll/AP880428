<HEAD>Chinese Cities Offer Direct Subsidies to Offset Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese cities will begin offering direct
subsidies to urban residents to help them cope with the soaring
prices of pork and other food, the official China Daily said
Thursday.
   In Shanghai, where vegetable prices almost doubled in the first
three months of this year, residents will each receive a monthly
subsidy of 10 yuan (about $2.70) as of May 1, the report said.
   People living in Beijing will receive a similar subsidy starting
sometime in the next few months, it said.
   The direct stipends replace government subsidies to state food
shops designed to keep food prices at an artificially low level.
That system has proved ineffective in stopping price increases as
consumers demand more and better food and farmers turn to free
markets where their goods command better prices.
   The daily said that starting this month, Changsha City in
southern China has subsidized residents 10 yuan a month for four
main non-staple goods _ pork, vegetables, sugar and eggs.
   Since then, the price for fresh pork at state stores has risen
from about 40 cents to 56 cents a pound, and sugar has gone up from
18 cents to 27 cents a pound.
   Retail prices nationwide rose 11 percent in the first quarter,
the first time the government has acknowledged double-digit
inflation. Prices of non-staple food items increased by 24.4
percent and vegetables jumped by 48.7 percent in the same period.

   About 17,000 people, many waving Japanese flags,
braved a drizzling rain Friday to give birthday greetings to
87-year-old Emperor Hirohito, the world's oldest and
longest-reigning monarch.
   Accompanied by Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko and
other members of the imperial family, the emperor made the first of
three scheduled appearances on a veranda overlooking a cheering
crowd in the Imperial Palace grounds. Missing was Empress Nagako,
85, who suffers back and leg ailments.
   Hirohito, protected by bullet-proof glass, said in a brief
speech, ``Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me today. I am
happy that so many of you have come today. I hope you will all have
a happy future.''
   His birthday is a national holiday.
   It was the emperor's second appearance in public since he was
hospitalized last September after complaining of fatigue and
nausea. Doctors performed a bypass then around an intestinal
obstruction.
   Hirohito, once worshiped as a living god, also spoke to
well-wishers at the palace grounds on New Year's Day.
   Despite a slow recovery after the operation and rumors of ill
health, Hirohito appeared relatively strong Friday, although he
shuffled slowly as he walked. Commentators on Japanese television
said he seemed to have regained about 90 percent of the strength he
had before the operation.
   The crowd shouted ``Long live the emperor!'' and waved flags.
Hirohito gave his characteristic front-and-back hand wave in
response.
   After about 2{ minutes, the imperial family filed back into the
palace, led by the emperor.
   Hirohito has been on the throne since Dec. 25, 1926.
   He told a news conference this week he feels well after his
surgery and needs years more to finish research in marine biology,
his favorite hobby.
   Hirohito said he had replanted an endangered plant species on
the palace grounds and ``it is growing well because the imperial
garden is similar to forest land.''
   The emperor also remarked that World War II was his ``most
unpleasant memory'' and urged the Japanese to pursue peace.
   The remarks were carried in Japanese by the Kyodo News Service
and translated by The Associated Press. The annual news conference,
reduced from its usual 30 minutes to 15 because of concern about
the emperor's health, took place Monday but the reports were not
released until his birthday.
   ``I have recovered well ... I respect a doctor's advice and am
trying not to overdo it,'' he said. `
   Asked by the Japanese reporters about his memories of World War
II, the emperor said: ``After all is considered, the war was my
most unpleasant memory. I am pleased with people's efforts for
peace after the war. Hereafter, I hope the people do not forget
this matter and protect peace.''
   He would not say say what caused Japan to go to war, declaring:
``I do not want to answer the question because this will involve
criticism against persons.''
   In meetings with foreign reporters, the emperor has expressed
sorrow for ``certain things'' that happened in the war, but said he
acted as a constitutional monarch and had no personal role. He
denied planning the attack on Pearl Harbor, but left many other
questions unanswered.
   Foreign reporters were not allowed at the birthday news
conference, during which he answered eight questions.
   Hirohito praised Yoshihiro Tokugawa, his former grand
chamberlain, who retired this month at age 81 after serving more
than half a century.
   ``He protected recordings of the emperor's announcement of the
defeat in the war,'' the emperor said. ``With his language
abilities, he prepared well for my friendly visits to Europe and
the United States.''
   Soldiers entered the imperial palace Aug. 15, 1945, planning to
seize the recording so the war could continue. Tokugawa was beaten
with a pistol, but refused to say where it was hidden.
   When the recording was finally played, it was the first time
most Japanese had heard their emperor's voice.
   In it, he urged his people ``to open an era of grand peace for
the generations to come, by suffering the insufferable, bearing the
unbearable.'' He did not use the words ``surrender'' or ``defeat.''

   A car careened across a playground and plowed
into a crowd of children and adults about to leave an elementary
school Thursday, killing a 4-year-old girl and a woman and injuring
eight others, officials said.
   At least four of the injured were in critical condition.
   ``I called for 10 ambulances,'' said Jim Crowe, principal at
Cyrus H. McCormick Elementary School. ``I told them there were
bodies all over the playground.''
   Witnesses said the car crashed through a chain-link fence and
careened across the playground before running up a short flight of
stairs to where the crowd was gathered in an entryway at the school.
   ``I was standing outside the school picking up my son when I
turned my head and saw the car coming towards the door,'' said
Marcella Diaz, 30, whose children, ages 8 and 5, attend the school.
``I just screamed and picked up my son with my hands and ran away.
The car missed us by a yard and a half.''
   ``There were mothers screaming, looking for their children,''
said Araceli Hernandez, whose niece lives with her and attends the
school. ``Almost every child that was on the floor had their mother
next to them.''
   The principal said the car pinned a child and an adult beneath
it.
   ``Myself and a couple of the teachers and a janitor picked the
car up and freed the bodies so they wouldn't be further crushed,''
he said.
   A woman driver reportedly left the car and walked from the
scene, the car still wedged in the entryway.
   Patrolman Richard Spielman said police were questioning a woman
who was picked up in the neighborhood minutes after the accident.
No cause was given for the accident.
   Reuben Fuentes, a student at McCormick, said the car belonged to
his family and that his mother apparently had come to the school to
pick him up. ``I got on my bus. I just saw my car, I don't know
where my mother is,'' he said.
   A 4-year-old girl and a woman died at Cook County and Mount
Sinai hospitals, spokeswomen said.
   In critical condition in Cook County Hospital were a 7-year-old
boy and a 10-year-old girl, both with head injuries, and two
children, ages 6 and 9, with leg fractures. A 7-year-old boy with
head injuries was in fair condition.
   A 29-year-old parent was hit by the car and thrown into air but
escaped serious injury, said Mount Sinai spokeswoman Dianne Smith.
   Two children, ages 6 and 5, were taken to the hospital; one had
head and neck injuries and was expected to be released, and the
other had bumps and bruises and was in good condition, Ms. Smith
said.
   ``The car smashed into the entrance where the kids were coming
out,'' said Rose Cepak, 78, who lives nearby.
   Third-grade teacher James E. Bailey said he saw a youngster
trying to calm one of the injured women. ``A child was stroking her
hair and telling her everything would be all right,'' Bailey said.

   Separatist guerrillas who kidnapped
23 lawmen freed an anti-terrorism expert on Thursday and ordered
him to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists, authorities said.
   Capt. Philippe Legorjus, chief of the French anti-terrorism
force in this French-held territory, was released from a cave on
the island of Ouvea and told to pursue negotiations with French
authorities, official sources in Noumea said.
   They threatened to kill their remaining hostages if he did not
return to the rebel hideaway, a system of caves 110 miles north of
here.
   Legorus, five police officers and an assistant prosecutor were
seized by the Melanesian separatists Wednesday as they sought to
negotiate the release of 15 other lawmen who had been kidnapped on
April 22.
   The initial hostages were among 27 people kidnapped in a bloody
attack at a police station that left four gendarmes dead. Twelve of
those hostages subsequently were freed.
   The attack was part of widespread violence aimed at halting
Sunday's French presidential elections on the island.
   Police said all the remaining hostages are being held in the
Ouvea caves.
   The Melanesian separatists, known as Kanaks, released Legorjus
to negotiate with French authorities in Fayaoue, a village on
Ouvea. Legorjus made at least one trip by helicopter from the cave
on Thursday.
   ``When you open talks, you take risks,'' Defense Minister Andre
Giraud, responsible for order in the Pacific archipelego, said in
Paris.
   Meanwhile, Bernard Pons, minister for overseas territories, said
in Noumea that he has asked the government to outlaw the Kanak
Socialist Liberation Front, which is seeking New Caledonia's
independence from France.
   ``It appears now that there is collusion between terrorist acts
carried out in certain parts of the territory, including the taking
of hostages on Ouvea, and the (Kanak political group),'' Pons said.
   Membership in a banned group is a crime under French law.
   In Paris, Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac referred to the
Kanak front as a ``terrorist faction'' that does not represent the
New Caledonian population.
   ``I will do everything so that this group is reduced,'' he said
during a televised debate with Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand, his rival in presidential run-off elections May 8.
   ``What counts today is the liberation of the gendarmes and
judicial offical,'' Mitterrand said. ``But what counts tomorrow is
dialogue.''
   Chirac did not clearly say whether he supported outlawing the
front.
   Such a ban must be voted by the Cabinet, which meets again
Wednesday. Mitterrand would have to sign the decree to make it law.
   Yeiwene Yeiwene, the No. 2 leader in the Kanak political group,
said banning the organization ``would not settle the crisis in New
Caledonia and will not stop the Kanak people from taking the fight
for independence to its end.''
   Since Friday last week, election-related violence has left six
people dead on New Caledonia and at least 10 wounded.
   Native Melanesians make up 43 percent of the population of
145,000, while 36 percent are Europeans and the rest primarily
Asian or Tahitian.
   Many Kanaks desire independence, while most Europeans wish to
retain ties to France.
   An estimated 4,000 French troops and gendarmes are in New
Caledonia.
   A French police officer was shot Thursday near Canala on the
east coast of the mainland, according to the national police
headquarters in Paris. He was listed in good condition at a Noumea
hospital.
   The kidnappers have demanded the removal of police
reinforcements from the islands. They asked that mediators be sent
from Paris to discuss a new referendum on self-determination.

   In a swirl of old lace and memories, about
100 former residents and 300 relatives gathered Wednesday to mark
the night a half-century ago when four western Massachusetts towns
were submerged to provide drinking water for Boston.
   Robert Garvey, the High Sheriff of Hampshire County, dressed in
top hat and tails and holding the 7-foot mace of his office, called
the dance to order and read a proclamation from Gov. Michael
Dukakis declaring 1988 a Year of Remembrance.
   ``We had to limit ticket sales to 400. That's all the hall would
hold,'' said Terry Campbell, secretary of a consortium of local
historical societies that sponsored the Remembrance Ball at the
University of Massachusetts.
   The dance tickets reprinted the black-bordered tickets to the
firemen's ball in 1938 at the Enfield Town Hall, where residents
met to mark the last hours of the towns that were drowned to create
the 38-square-mile Quabbin Reservoir.
   Their steps might be slower and their hair turned silver, but
for former residents _ many in their 70s and 80s _ the memory was
still fresh of that night when people jammed the little brick Town
Hall, hung with red, white and blue bunting and draped in black,
and spilled into the streets.
   ``The orchestra ... faintly sounded the strain of `Auld Land
Syne' ... muffled sounds of sobbing were heard, hardened men were
not ashamed to take out their handkerchiefs,'' the Springfield
Morning Union reported in 1938.
   Fifty years later, 38 people who attended the Enfield party held
hands and marched around the hall. Their reminiscences, jotted down
on their dance programs, were read aloud between dance tunes.
   ``We went to school at the Enfield Town Hall. We lived in the
center of town. That's the deepest part of the reservoir now,''
said Joy Dickenson Boch.
   The towns of Dana, Prescott, Enfield and Greenwich _ home for
2,500 people _were submerged at midnight April 27, 1938. The
reservoir took 20 years to build and cost $53 million and the lives
of more than 20 workers.
   It now provides drinking water for 2.5 million people, half of
the state's population. Although it's not the largest reservoir in
the United States, none larger has been built strictly to provide
drinking water.

   A judge Wednesday ordered the government to
pay $4.2 million to a truck driver left brain-damaged and paralyzed
in 1984 when he was hit by a piece of NASA equipment being loaded
onto his flatbed trailer.
   U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi ruled that NASA employees
were negligent in the accident involving Gary Spitzke, 57, of
suburban Diamond Bar.
   The accident left Spitzke a quadriplegic in need of 24-hour
care, said his attorney, Howard Krepack.
   Spitzke was working as a driver for a heavy equipment hauling
company when the accident happened at a National Aeronautics and
Space Administration research facility near San Jose, Krepack said.
   The veteran trucker was helping to load a cargo lift trailer,
which is used in the space shuttle program, onto his flatbed truck
for transport to a Southern California defense contractor when the
load shifted and rotated, knocking him off the flatbed, Krepack
said.
   The judgment was satisfactory to Spitzke and his wife, Susan,
the attorney said.
   ``They would prefer that it never happened ... or the
alternative, that they can make him well but unfortunately that
can't be done,'' he said.

   Somnang Rom, a 10-year-old Cambodian
refugee, bounded off the airplane and into the arms of the elder
brother who'd last seen him as an infant.
   The boy is part of a family that was reunited Tuesday night
after a decade apart. They had been separated by the Khmer Rouge
takeover in that Southeast Asian nation.
   Somnang and his mother, Prak Soy, arrived in Lebanon, N.H., on
Tuesday night for an emotional reunion with Sarin Rom, who came to
this country in 1983 and has been trying to reunite with his mother
and brother since learning they were alive.
   After the communist takeover of Cambodia, the father was taken
away by soldiers and is presumed dead. Two siblings starved to
death. A brother is missing. A sister is married and lives in
Cambodia.
   The younger Rom and his mother spent Wednesday adjusting to a
new life in Vermont.
   ``I heard a ball bouncing this morning at 5:30,'' Judy Smiley,
who lives below the family, said Wednesday. ``He learned how to use
the camera and has been taking pictures all morning.''
   Smiley said they turned lights off and on as they experimented
with electricity and watched television for the first time.
   ``They couldn't understand,'' Smiley said, describing their
fascination with the tube. ``Somnang was jumping up and down.''
   The red tape that delayed the reunion frustrated Sarin and the
people of Windsor who helped him, including foster parents,
friends, local churches and community groups. Many came to the
airport Tuesday to greet the family.
   ``There were so many delays,'' said Judith May, the Vermont
Refugee Coordinator. ``We had to wait for so many governments to
find a way.''
   Smiley, Sarin Rom's foster mother, said the reunion is not quite
complete. A 16-year-old sister, Romdoul, still remains overseas.
She was reportedly abducted while in a refugee camp.
   U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said his office became involved
because the entire community was backing Rom in his efforts to find
his family.
   ``We've been working with them for 17 months,'' Leahy said.
``There were times when we didn't know whether we'd get anwyhere.''

   Oscar-winning actor Michael Douglas insists his
marriage is intact, and suggests rumors that he and his wife,
Diandra, are splitting may be an unhappy spinoff of his role as an
adulterer in ``Fatal Attraction.'
   Douglas, who recently won an Oscar for Best Actor for his latest
movie ``Wall Street,'' spoke to reporters Wednesday before a London
premiere of the film, at which Princess Diana was a guest.
   Asked if his marriage to Diandra, a 30-year-old model, was over
as some reports have said, Douglas said, ``It's not true and I
really do not know how any of it got started.
   ``I suppose it was doing pictures like `Fatal Attraction,''' a
movie about how a family was thrown into crisis by the husband's
adultery.
   Asked whether he saw anything of his own personality in the
character he played in the movie, he retorted, ``How long have you
been married? Do you fool around?''
   When the reporter declined to answer, he went on to the next
question.

   Former Mayor Jane Byrne, making good on her
promise to leave politics after a series of shattering defeats,
says she will begin work next week as an environmental relations
consultant for a public relations firm.
   Mrs. Byrne said Tuesday she also has begun writing an
autobiography, and will teach a course in government at Loyola
University.
   The city's former chief executive lost her recent bid for the
Democratic nomination for clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court
after two unsuccessful bids to regain the mayor's office.
Afterward, she vowed not to seek elective office again.
   She said she has accepted a job with Daniel J. Edelman Inc., a
public relations firm in Chicago.
   ``I will be working in public affairs, primarily on
environmental issues,'' said Mrs. Byrne, who noted that she was
familiar with the subject from her work as Chicago's commissioner
of consumer services in the 1970s.

``Broadcast News,'' has won the first Spencer Tracy Award for his
``outstanding'' performances.
   The award, an 8-inch crystal teardrop sculpture engraved with
Hurt's name, was presented to him Wednesday by the late actor's
daughter, Sarah, at an auditorium packed with more than 1,800

   Hurt was the overwhelming choice for the first Tracy Award,
which honors actors for ``outstanding screen performances and
professional achievement,'' said Willard Tressel, student

   Blair Underwood, who portrays the
devious lawyer Jonathan Rollins on NBC-TV's ``L.A. Law,'' came to
the defense of his former acting teacher during a tenure hearing at
West Virginia University.
   ``I know the kind of woman she is, and I would not be where I am
today without her guidance and teaching,'' said Underwood, who
studied under Angela D'Ambrosia while she was at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.
   D'Ambrosia applied for tenure at WVU in 1986 after teaching
there for two years. Her request was denied and a state hearing
examiner is conducting an appeals hearing, which is expected to
conclude today.
   Underwood, 23, said Wednesday that D'Ambrosia is one of two
people he consults for advice about his work.
   ``Through her I have been able to grow as an actor and I really
attribute my success to her teachings,'' Underwood said. ``Coming
here and testifying on her behalf is my way of giving back a little
of what she has done for me.''
   Joining Underwood in his defense of D'Ambrosia was actress Lisa
Waltz, who played Nora in the movie ``Brighton Beach Memoirs.''
Waltz also studied with D'Ambrosia while the instructor was at
Carnegie Mellon.

   Two young instrumentalists were wealthier to the
tune of $4,000 today as recipients of the Martin E. Segal Award,
named for the former chairman of the Lincoln Center board.
   ``They are our hope for the future, and also for civilization,''
George Weissman, chairman of Lincoln Center, said Wednesday in
presenting $4,000 awards to trumpeter Richard Kelley, 21, a
sophomore at the Juilliard School, and George Wellington, 29,
bassist, performing with the New York Philharmonic.
   The award was announced in 1986 when Segal retired as chairman
of the Lincoln Center board. Money to help further careers of young
artists connected in some way with Lincoln Center was donated by
the board and Segal's friends.
   The first recipients of the award were filmmaker Anita Thatcher,
whose work has been presented by the Film Society of Lincoln
Center, and Karen Notare, soprano in the New York City Opera's
national touring company. They received the award last year.

   Germans have a reputation for
tidiness, but a study found most West German men don't change their
underwear every day.
   Only 45 percent of West German men and 70 percent of West German
women change their underwear daily, professor Reinhold Bergler, who
conducted the study, was quoted as saying in newspapers on
Wednesday.
   Bergler's survey indicated that 56 percent of French men and 94
percent of French women change their underwear daily. The Spanish
were rated even better at 59 percent for men and 96 percent for
women, the newspapers said.
   Frankfurt's daily Abendpost newspaper ran a front-page story on
the study under the headline: ``Are German Men Pigs?''
   Bergler, a Bonn University professor, was quoted as saying he
was surprised by the poll because Germans are brought up to live in
clean surroundings.

   President Alan Garcia prolonged a state of
emergency in an isolated mining region where Maoist guerrilla
attacks are common.
   In a decree signed by Garcia and published in the official
gazette El Peruano on Wednesday, the anti-guerrilla measures were
extended for 20 days in Castrovierreyna County, a mining zone 150
miles southeast of Lima.
   The county covers a third of Huancavelica state, which adjoins
Ayacucho state, where the Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group
eight years ago began an insurgency aimed at toppling Peru's
elected government.
   The violence quickly spread to Huancavelica, one of Peru's most
impoverished and isolated regions and later engulfed other highland
zones.
   States of emergency, which limit civil rights, are now in affect
in Lima and parts of six other states where more than half Peru's
population lives.

<HEAD>AIDS Costs Pegged At $6.8 Million For Four Hollywood Unions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Hollywood unions spent $6.8
million on treatment for 138 AIDS patients by early this year, but
a representative of producers and studios says the problem is no
worse than in other industries.
   Nicholas Counter III, president of the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers, said Wednesday he was sure that
the figures from union health insurance funds were ``understated''
because some AIDS insurance claims may be reported as related
diseases rather than AIDS.
   Counter's remarks represent the first time anyone has attempted
to compile statistics on the number of AIDS patients whose care is
being paid by health insurance funds serving the entertainment
industry's five major unions.
   But he dismissed fears that AIDS can be spread by casual
contact, including on movie and television filming sets, and said
he was convinced the deadly disease, which cripples the body's
immune system, cannot be spread by so-called ``deep kissing'' by
actors and actresses.
   ``I don't see that this problem is any worse or any less in our
industry than in all industries,'' Counter said at a conference
titled ``Managing AIDS at Work.''
   He urged entertainment unions and companies to ``wage war on
this disease on four fronts'' _ education, prevention, research and
care.
   The insurer providing coverage for one of the industry's five
funds _ the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
(AFTRA) Health and Retirement Funds _ refused to provide statistics
on the number of its 22,000 members who have AIDS or the cost of
their care, said alliance government affairs specialist Dan
Goldberg, who compiled the statistics for Counter.
   The 138 patients reported by mid-February and the $6,821,000
cost of caring for them represent statistics reported by insurance
funds for the other four major Hollywood union health funds,
Counter said.
   Scientists say acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread by
intimate sexual contact, the sharing of needles by intravenous drug
abusers and when passed from mothers to their unborn children.

<BYLINE>New Class of Superconducting Material Enters High-Temperature Race
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new, high-temperature record for
superconductivity in materials that lack copper has raised hopes
that such substances may one day make superconductivity practical,
scientists reported today.
   A mix of potassium, barium, bismuth and oxygen showed evidence
of superconductivity at about minus 406 degrees Fahrenheit,
researchers from AT&T Bell Laboratories reported in the British
journal Nature.
   That temperature essentially equals the 1986 mark that focused
world attention on superconductivity. But it is well behind the
current record for materials that contain copper, the chief focus
of superconductivity research.
   Superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct
electricity without resistance. Improved superconductors could lead
to powerful computers, high-speed ``floating'' trains and other
advances, scientists say.
   So far, all known materials must be ``supercooled'' to
superconduct, and that limits their use. So scientists are trying
to find superconductors that work at higher temperatures, even room
temperature.
   Since the 1986 report of superconductivity at about minus 406
degrees, researchers have used copper compounds to superconduct at
minus 243 degrees.
   The performance by a copper-free compound indicates ``a whole
new ballfield'' for study, said Paul Fleury of Bell Laboratories.
   Still higher temperatures for copper-free compounds may yet be
attained, said Bob Laudise of Bell Labs.
   The work shows copper can be replaced, and by a broader list of
potential ingredients than many theories would have predicted,
Laudise said.
   ``With so many possibilities, the chances of getting something
that will have all the desirable properties in one material will be
enlarged,'' he said.
   Those properties include ease of fabrication into wires and
other devices and the ability to retain superconductivity while
exposed to high currents or high magnetic fields, he said.
   The material's atomic structure suggests it may have one
practical advantage over other known superconductors, Laudise said.
   Copper-based superconductors work best when the electrical
current runs parallel to their stacked layers of copper and oxygen
atoms. But the new material has no such layers.
   Instead, bismuth and oxygen atoms form interconnected sheets
that extend along all three dimensions. That suggests that it may
carry current equally well in all three dimensions, which could
simplify making superconducting wires and other products, Laudise
said.
   Studies of the earlier compounds had concluded that the
copper-oxygen layers were essential for their superconductivity.
   The new material shows those layers are not always needed,
although the temperature in copper-free compounds may go higher if
researchers can create bismuth-oxygen layers, said Fleury.
   The finding ``is likely to give us a much better insight into
the nature of high-temperature superconductivity'' than would
emerge from studying just the materials with copper, he said.
   The Bell researchers were led by Robert Cava and Bertram Batlogg.
   Other superconductivity experts said the report's importance
will depend on whether copper-free materials can perform as well as
previous superconductors.
   The more ingredients that can be used, the better the chance of
finding a room-temperature superconductor, said physics professor
Arthur J. Freeman of Northwestern University. ``This is a first
step, and a good one,'' he said.
   ``Once again, it just tells me we've just seen the tip of the
iceberg'' for superconducting materials, said Brian Maple of the
University of California, San Diego.

<HEAD>USDA Says It Will Rewrite Sugar Cane Rules Under Court Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department plans to act
quickly on a federal judge's order to rewrite its rules excluding
sugar cane as a perishable commodity.
   Rewriting the rules could open the way for thousands of foreign
field workers to become legal U.S. residents, an avenue barred to
them if USDA's original definition of sugar cane as a
non-perishable crop were allowed to stand.
   Department officials said Wednesday the court's decision was
under review and modified regulations could be expedited, although
they declined to give a timetable.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan, in a ruling released
Tuesday, said the department ``arbitrarily and capriciously
excluded'' sugar cane from the perishables list and to ``conduct
further proceedings'' to determine the crop's status.
   The decision resulted from a lawsuit filed on behalf of sugar
cane workers.
   Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the USDA a
year ago defined fruits, vegetables and other perishable
commodities which are produced as a result of seasonal field work.
   The law's Special Agricultural Worker, or SAW, program allowed
temporary legal resident status for foreign workers who formerly
helped in the U.S. production of designated perishable crops. The
law also provided avenues for alien workers to become U.S. citizens.
   By the department's definition, those crops not only included
fruit and vegetables, but also wheat, sugar beets and a number of
other commodities. Sugar cane was excluded from the list of
perishables.
   Hogan said Al French, the department's chief labor specialist in
the development of the regulations, had relied on a telephone call
to a USDA economist to determine the category of sugar cane as a
crop ``despite the extensive written record'' on the matter.
   ``Based on this conversation and his own personal knowledge
regarding the harvesting and labor practices in the sugar cane
industry, Mr. French concluded that sugar cane was outside the
scope of perishable commodities,'' Hogan said.
   The agency, he added, rejected the impact of weather condition
on crops because of the difficulty in measuring the impact or ``the
overinclusive nature of such a criterion.''
   French has been a special assistant for labor in USDA since Jan.
12, 1987, and had held previous posts in Florida with USDA, the
Florida Farm Bureau, and as a labor relations consultant with
Management Research Institute.
   Although he declined to predict just when USDA would make the
changes to comply with the court decision, French said, ``We're not
going to drag our feet on this.''
   The sugar cane revision could be handled internally by the
department or could involve a public hearing, he said.

   Federal quarantine restrictions to prevent the
further spread of tiny bee mites have been reduced in Mississippi
and Washington.
   However, the tiny killer mites _ Varroa Jacobsoni _ still remain
a potential threat to the U.S. bee industry, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday. All or parts of 13 states remain under
federal quarantine restrictions.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the revision for Mississippi
and Washington retains ``only that portion of each state that must
be quarantined to keep the Varroa mite from spreading.''
   Glosser said the statewide quarantine in Mississippi was reduced
to parts of Adams, Franklin and Wilkinson counties, while the
Washington quarantine area was reduced to part of Klickitat County.
   Varroa mites were discovered in the United States last September
in a Wisconsin apiary. Since then, they have been found in 12 other
states: Florida, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota and
Washington.
   The original federal quarantine was effective on April 6 and
restricted the interstate movement of bees and bee equipment from
all 13 states.
   Glosser said the change in the original quarantine was partly
because both Mississippi and Washington are enforcing restrictions
on the movement of bees and bee equipment within their own borders.
   The mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their
developing larvae, or brood. It causes decreased brood, deformed
bees and a weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants
and produce honey. Infestation can occur so gradually that the
mites may not be noticed until severe damage is done.

   The Agriculture Department says a highly
contagious viral disease of poultry and other fowl has been found
in pet birds in Michigan and Nevada.
   No domestic poultry has been involved in the outbreak, James W.
Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, said Wednesday.
   But laboratory tests confirmed exotic Newcastle disease in a
three-week-old spectacled Amazon parrot and in a young yellow-naped
parrot owned by private individuals, he said.
   The birds and a number of others that were exposed to the
infected birds were destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease.
   Glosser said the birds' premises in West Bloomfield, Mich., and
Las Vegas, Nev., were placed under state quarantines. Federal and
state authorities are tracing the disease to determine if
additional birds or premises may have been exposed.
   Exotic Newcastle disease can cause death rates of 50 percent to
95 percent in poultry flocks. Officials say the disease poses no
risk to humans who eat poultry or eggs, but in some cases people
who handle infected birds can contract the virus, which in humans
causes temporary eye inflammation and ``mild flu-like symptoms.''

<HEAD>Nurse: Liberace Gravely Ill On Day Signed Final Will</HEAD>

   Liberace could barely carry on a
conversation in the two weeks before he died and was gravely ill
the day he signed his revised will, a nurse who cared for the
glitzy entertainer testified Wednesday.
   The pianist couldn't even find his way back to bed from the
bathroom on the day of the signing, nurse Norma Garber said at a
hearing on a request by associates of Liberace's to remove Joel
Strote as executor of his estate.
   The testimony contradicted that of Strote, Liberace's attorney,
who said that Liberace sat at a table Jan. 22, 1987 talking with
him and going over the estate papers before signing them. The
papers named Strote executor.
   ``He'd say yes to anything to please (at that point),'' said
Gerber. ``He just wanted to please anyone and be left alone.''
   Gerber said she cared for Liberace from the day he signed the
will until he died of AIDS 13 days later, on Feb. 5, 1987. Liberace
could not put on his glasses or hold a book during his dying days
at his Palm Springs home, she said.
   ``He couldn't have a conversation, he was too sick. The motor
coordination was going so he'd have difficulty speaking,'' she
said. ``He was so childlike he didn't know what he was saying.''
   The five seeking to have Strote removed _ Liberace's sister, his
former manager, two housekeepers and a longtime friend _ were given
a total of $1 million in the will, the terms of which were made
public Wednesday.
   Testimony indicated three of the five received more in the
deathbed will Strote drew up than in a will Liberace executed in
1982. Liberace also left $50,000 in trust to take care of his seven
dogs, which he often referred to as his ``babies.''
   Strote has estimated the value of the estate at $11 million. His
manager of 37 years, Seymoour Heller, has estimated the figure at
$20 million.
   Strote on Tuesday defended the signing of the new will and two
trusts. He said he had Liberace examined by a doctor first, and the
doctor was convinced Liberace was ``in good condition and could
understand'' the documents.
   ``I wanted to make sure he was physically able to go through the
documents and understand them,'' Strote said.
   Strote said Liberace signed the will and two trusts, but balked
at a fourth document, a living will that would allow doctors to
remove life support systems if they became necessary. ``He said `I
just can't sign this,''' Strote recalled.
   Strote said he felt he had to move quickly in tying down the
entertainer's assets and cutting expenditures, which he said were
running $100,000 to $200,000 a month, more than the estate was
generating.
   ``I wanted to liquidate the property while his image and
likeness were fresh in the minds of the buying public,'' Strote
testified. An auction of Liberace memorabilia in Los Angeles
earlier this month netted some $2 million.

   Privately owned housing for the poor could
almost disappear within 15 years as owners default on mortgage
payments or convert property to high-rent apartments and
condominiums, a bipartisan commission says.
   The National Low-Income Housing Preservation Commission said
Wednesday in a report to House and Senate housing subcommittees
that the cheapest way to ensure the poor have housing is to
preserve and even fix up the current housing stock.
   It suggested that the federal government earmark $11.3 billion
over the next 15 years to keep owners from converting the housing
and to help owners who are having trouble making mortgage payments.
   An additional $6.4 billion should go toward continuing federal
subsidies, the commission said. It also recommended an office
should be set up within the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to deal only with the issue.
   ``Everyone talks about the homeless as the tip of the iceberg,''
said Linda Parke Gallagher, executive director of the commission.
``We have described the iceberg. We are going to have a new
generation of the homeless.''
   Gallagher said 70 percent of the people living in the subsidized
housing have incomes below 50 percent of the median for their area.
``These are very poor people,'' she said.
   If the stock of privately owned subsidized housing should dry
up, the poor may have no other housing options, she said
   Much of this country's low-income housing was built in the 1960s
and early 1970s. Some of it is federally owned, some state-owned.
   The commission, in the report called ``Preventing the
Disappearance of Low-Income Housing,'' discusses only privately
owned properties subsidized by HUD with mortgages insured by the
Federal Housing Administration. That amounts to about 645,000 units.
   The commission argues that without federal action, owners of 43
percent _ or 280,000 units _ will default and an additional 38
percent _ 243,000 units _ will prepay their mortgages in the next
15 years.
   Gallagher, along with an HUD spokesman, said the federal
government in the past has had to deal with scattered cases of
defaults.
   Both Gallagher and HUD spokesman Thomas Denery said that there
also have been numerous instances of prepayments of mortgages by
owners who want to free their properties from HUD restrictions and
rent or sell to higher-income people.
   Gallagher said the prepayment problem has been especially
prevalent in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington and
California.
   But the commission concludes that both the prepayments and
defaults will accelerate in the next decade as federal rent subsidy
contracts expire.
   Also accelerating the trend is the new federal income tax law,
which removed many of the tax incentives for investing in such
housing.
   ``Everyone dealing with the project was surprised at the
projected level of default,'' Gallagher said. ``Add that together
with the prepayments and we see the number of units of low-income
housing going steadily downward.''
   Demery, who is assistant secretary for housing and federal
housing commissioner, said he supports the commission's basic
premise _ that it is better to preserve existing housing for the
poor rather than build new housing.
   He also complimented the commission for trying to look at
lower-cost solutions to the problem, although he suggested that
there may be even less expensive ways.
   Demery said he opposes the commission's recommendation that a
separate office to set up inside HUD to deal with preserving the
privately owned low-income housing.
   ``I've had people specializing in this for a year and a half,''
he said. ``The issue also has the focus and attention of an
assistant secretary.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan Dwelling on Past Presidents</HEAD>
<HEAD>By W. DALE NELSON</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As he comes closer and closer to being a
former president, Ronald Reagan's thoughts seem to be turning to
the men who have held the nation's highest office before him.
   In recent speeches, Reagan has invoked the memory of Abraham
Lincoln, John Quincy Adams, Lyndon Johnson and Theodore Roosevelt
to make serious or humorous points, or both.
   All presidents refer to their predecessors from time to time,
either favorably or not.
   By custom, each president gets to pick the pictures of former
presidents that hang in the Cabinet Room. Reagan, for instance,
replaced Harry S. Truman with Calvin Coolidge.
   Now the president, who leaves office next Jan. 20, is quoting
the wit and wisdom of presidents past, recalling how they dealt
with the press and with their cabinets.
   On March 22, addressing Republican local officials at the White
House, Reagan related a story that he said Lincoln told when he
found all but one of his Cabinet officers were against him on an
issue.
   The story was about a man who fell asleep during a revival
meeting just before the minister said, ``All of you who are on the
side of the Lord, stand up.''
   As the man slept on, the minister intoned, ``All of you who are
on the side of the devil, stand up.''
   At that point the sleeper awoke, stood up and said, ``I didn't
exactly understand the question, parson, but I'll stand by you to
the end. It does seem we're in a hopeless minority.''
   Reagan went on to tell the Republicans that they might be in a
minority among city officials who claim the GOP has shorted them,
but their views are ``the majority beliefs in this United States of
America.''
   On March 30, presiding at the swearing-in of William L. Ball III
as secretary of the Navy, Reagan told one about Theodore Roosevelt.
   T.R., he said, once told Saint Peter: ``Your choir is weak,
inexcusably weak. You should reorganize it at once.''
   Saint Peter says, ``All right,'' and gives T.R. the job.
   ``Well,'' said Roosevelt, ``I'll need 10,000 sopranos, 10,000
altos, and 10,000 tenors.''
   ``But what about the basses?'' asked Saint Peter.
   ``Don't worry about that,'' said T.R. ``I`ll sing bass.''
   Like Roosevelt, Reagan said, Ball's job now was to be ``a
one-man bass section.''
   On April 13, addressing the American Society of Newspaper
Editors in Washington, Reagan told stories about John Quincy Adams
and Lyndon Johnson and their dealings with the press.
   ``Every morning before dawn, Adams would hike down to the
Potomac, strip off his clothes, and swim,'' he said. ``And one
summer day, a woman of the press, under orders from her editor,
followed him. And after he'd plunged into the water, she popped
from the bushes, sat on his clothes, and demanded an interview. And
she told him that if he tried to wade ashore, she'd scream. So
Adams hld the first press conference up to his neck in water.
   ``I know how he felt.''
   Of Johnson, he said that once when LBJ was coming off the Senate
floor while he was vice president, he grabbed a reporter for The
New York Times and shouted, ``You! I've been looking for you.''
   Johnson pulled the reporter into his office, started haranguing
him and then, about halfway through, scribbled a note, buzzed his
secretary, and gave it to her.
   The secretary returned with another note, which Johnson glanced
at and threw away. When the reporter finally got away, he saw
Johnson's note lying on a desk. It said, ``Who is this guy I'm
talking to anyway?''

<HEAD>Bill To Permit Drilling On Refuge Clears Subcommittee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of petroleum development in the
nation's biggest wildlife refuge are gaining ground in Congress but
say they are fighting the clock to get their drilling bill enacted
this year.
   Led by the Reagan administration and the oil industry, the
advocates won another round against environmental groups on
Wednesday as legislation to allow oil rigs into the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge was endorsed by the first House panel to vote on
the issue.
   The bill was approved 17-9 by the Merchant Marine subcommittee
on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment, setting
the stage for expected approval next week by the full committee.
   Earlier this year, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee voted 11-8 for legislation to allow development of the
potentially extensive oil deposits in the coastal plain of the 19
million-acre reserve in Alaska. The bill is awaiting floor debate.
   The issue has provoked a major struggle in the 100th Congress
between environmentalists, who want no drilling in the refuge, and
those who say the refuge offers the best chance to counter a
growing national dependence on imported petroleum.
   An Interior Department study says development can be carried out
in an environmentally sound manner and could produce oil to rival
the Prudhoe Bay complex about 70 miles to the west. Prudhoe Bay
accounts for about 20 percent of U.S. production.
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, one of the major House champions of
drilling in the refuge, said Wednesday that time is growing short.
   Young quoted House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, as saying that
because of a crowded calendar and time off for political
conventions and reelection campaigns, a drilling bill needs to get
to the House floor by mid-June to ensure approval by Congress this
year.
   The House Interior Committee also has jurisdiction over the
issue. Its chairman, Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., is sponsoring
legislation to declare the refuge permanently off-limits to
petroleum development.
   The Interior water and power resources subcommittee is not
planning to hold hearings on refuge legislation until early June.
In the past, the Interior Committee has been more sympathetic to
environmentalist positions than many other House panels.
   The Merchant Marine subcommittee approved a plan drafted by Rep.
Walter Jones, D-N.C., to allow phased oil leasing over a decade but
bar development in a 260,000-acre are used for calving by a
migratory caribou herd.
   Drilling in the refuge would be exempt from the Refuge
Administration Act of 1966's requirement that development be
compatible with a refuge's basic purpose of preserving wildlife
habitat.
   That law requires developers to prove compatibility, a difficult
task. Jones' bill, however, would force opponents of developing the
coastal plain to prove that such activity would have significant
and adverse long-term effects on habitat, also seen by subcommittee
lawyers as a difficult task.
   The bill would prohibit export of any petroleum extracted from
the 1.5 million acre coastal plain and would require any ocean
transport of this oil to be done on ships registered in the United
States.
   The legislation also would create a new 23.5 million-acre
Teshekpuk-Utukok National Wildlife Refuge to the west of Prudhoe
Bay and place a five-year moratorium on any petroleum leasing in
the new refuge.
   Drilling foes repeatedly failed in attempts to amend the bill.
Rejected proposals included variations on the theme of putting off
a decision on the coastal plain until completion of a national
energy policy study emphasizing conservation and renewables.

   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Cleveland Mayor
George Voinovich are off on one of the earliest U.S. Senate
campaigns Ohio has seen in years, with both sides looking beyond
Tuesday's primary to November.
   Most of Ohio's incumbent congressmen are getting a free ride in
their primaries, but a hot race is on for the seat of retiring GOP
Rep. Delbert Latta, and one incumbent Democrat has a well-known
challenger.
   Voinovich has no opposition in the Republican primary, and
Metzenbaum, a two-term Democrat, is opposed by Ralph Applegate, a
political newcomer from Columbus who has hardly been heard from
since filing in February.
   Voinovich, who early on admited that Metzenbaum had the edge in
name recognition, already has spent more than $1 million, much of
it on media ads.
   Peter Harris, Metzenbaum's campaign manager, said the senator's
roughly $840,000 in spending this year was proof Metzenbaum doesn't
intend to ``let the mayor go unanswered.''
   Latta's district seat, in rural Northwest Ohio where Democrats
seldom win anything, has drawn the incumbent's son, Robert, a
Bowling Green attorney, into a primary race against State Senate
President Paul Gillmor, of Port Clinton, and Rex Damschroder, of
Fremont.
   Gillmor is known statewide after 21 years in the Senate and an
unsuccessful bid for governor two years ago.
   The younger Latta, a candidate in his father's conservative
image, has accused Gillmor of being too liberal for the district's
voters. Damschroder has raised far less money than either of his
better known opponents.
   In Cleveland, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, who seeks her sixth term, is
pitted in the Democratic primary against Dennis Kucinich, the
former Cleveland mayor who has attracted large numbers of
blue-collar votes in the past.
   Kucinich is relying on name recognition to help him in the
campaign against the popular Ms. Oakar in the heavily Democratic
district.

<HEAD>Canadian Leader Gets Nothing From Reagan on Acid Rain</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: prenoon EDT top planned; morning meetings with Bush, Byrd and
at Canadian embassy.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney came to
Washington seeking more U.S. action to reduce the acid rain that he
likens to ``dumping garbage'' on his country, but he got no
promises from President Reagan.
   During a one-hour meeting on Wednesday, Reagan held to the
administration's 7-year-old position that more research is needed
before targets are set for reducing the pollution blamed for acid
rain.
   Mulroney had used the meeting and a subsequent speech to
Congress to renew Canadian pleas that the United States follow his
country's lead by setting specific pollution-reduction targets and
timetables.
   Canada's program will cut pollution levels there to half the
1980 levels by 1994, Mulroney told Congress.
   ``But that is only half the solution, because the other half of
our acid rain comes across the border, directly from the United
States, falling upon our forests, killing our lakes, soiling our
cities,'' Mulroney said.
   The Reagan administration has rebuffed pleas from Northeastern
states as well as Canada to set targets and timetables, calling
instead for more scientific investigation to establish the most
effective cleanup methods before spending money on acid rain
reduction.
   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that Mulroney gave Reagan ``some private ideas'' on how they might
narrow their differences on the issue.
   The talks, however, did not alter the administration view that
there is little possibility an acid rain accord sought by Mulroney
will be reached before Reagan leaves office next January, the
official said.
   Prior to his Washington visit, Mulroney said the U.S. acid-rain
emissions drifting into his country are tantamount to ``dumping
garbage'' on Canada. Using more elegant language in his speech to
Congress, he said, in effect, the United States is doing the same
to its own environment.
   ``The one thing acid rain does not do is discriminate,'' he
said. ``It is despoiling your environment as inexorably as ours. It
is damaging your environment from Michigan to Maine, and threatens
marine life on the Eastern Seabord.''
   He welcomed additional research into ways to reduce emissions
from coal-fired furnaces, but said more action is needed.
   ``Canada will continue to press fully its case to rid our common
environment of this blight, and we shall perservere until our skies
regain their purity and our rains recover the gentleness that gives
life to our forests and streams. And we hope the U.S. Congress and
people will respond exactly the same way,'' he said.
   ``The cost of reducing acid rain is substantial, but the cost of
inaction is greater still,'' he added.
   While the leaders remained apart on the acid rain issue, they
joined in an appeal to both nations' legislatures to ratify the
U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, designed to abolish tariffs and
further enrich what is already the world's biggest trading
partnership.
   Mulroney noted that the United States sells more goods in Canada
than it does to Britain, France, West Germany and Italy combined.
   ``This is a good, balanced and fair agreement, the most
important ever concluded between two trading partners,'' Mulroney
said.
   Reagan and Mulroney also said they do not believe the pact will
be endangered by Reagan's threatened veto of a trade bill being
considered in the Senate, the official reporting on their meeting
said.
   Reagan also gave his permission for the Canadian purchase of
tightly-held U.S. nuclear submarine technology. The Canadians are
considering the purchase of 10 or 12 nuclear-powered attack
submarines from France or Britain. If they choose the British
``Trafalgar'' class subs, U.S. permission will be required because
the submarines use American power plants.
   An amendment to current U.S.-Canadian agreements would also be
required and thorough Capitol Hill discussion of the issue is
likely.
   John Warner of Virginia, senior Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said ``the president's decision to transfer
classified technology must rest on national security interests, not
political considerations.''
   He said Congress will explore the issue ``extensively.''
   Reagan and Mulroney set aside their differences over acid rain
and accentuated the positive at a White House state dinner
Wednesday evening. Reagan lauded his Canadian counterpart as ``a
good neighbor and a firm friend,'' and Mulroney reciprocated by
calling Reagan ``honest and wise.''

   With a spray of rhetoric, the House of
Representatives exterminated a bill that would have made the
praying mantis South Carolina's official insect.
   There was little alternative when Rep. Woody Aydlette strode to
the podium with his tongue firmly in cheek and suggested a
down-home alternative: the cockroach.
   Aydlette noted that the state already had plenty of symbols:
among them a state bird (Carolina wren), a state flower (yellow
jessamine), a state dance (the shag), a state fruit (peach) and a
state dog (Boykin spaniel).
   ``I don't think we need to name anything else, but if you are so
inclined and insistent on naming a bug, I submit to your approval
... the cockroach of Charleston, or the palmetto bug,'' Aydlette
said, drawing belly laughs from his colleagues.
   ``This thing's been around South Carolina for 50 or 60 billion
years and hasn't changed. Insecticides don't do much to it. They
race these things every year at the College of Charleston. They do
fly in formation at night. And we have heard tales of them hauling
off small animals,'' he said.
   The Charleston Republican said he preferred just defeating the
proposal, but insisted on his choice of insect if the discussion
continued.
   The House decided to drop the subject of state symbols
altogether.

   Ah spring! For most of the nation, it's a
time of fragrant flowers and verdant renewal. In Alaska, it's when
the ice breaks.
   So momentous is the event that since 1917 Nenana has held its
Ice Classic, an opportunity for area residents to predict the exact
moment of the ice break-up on the Tanana River.
   This year, three Anchorage residents shared the $130,000 prize
for being the only ones out of 146,300 entries to correctly guess
when the 3-to-4-foot-thick ice would begin flowing down the river:
10:15 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``It kind of took everyone by surprise,'' said Wayne Taylor,
contest manager. ``It's the first time the ice has ever gone out on
April 27.''
   The prize was split among Dan Nicoll, a construction worker, Mac
Davis, 43, an accountant, and his 62-year-old brother, Harry, a
retired postal worker who lives in Sacramento, Calif. The brothers
have been buying Ice Classic tickets for about 20 years.
   ``It's a real suprise to us, because the ice was 46 inches
thick, about 7 to 9 inches above normal,'' Taylor said. ``But we've
had a very warm spring, temperatures overnight have been around 42
degrees. You can see the base logs of the tripod now. They were
buried 21 inches into the ice.''
   Last year the ice went out May 5 at 3:11 p.m. The $155,000 prize
was split among 19 people.

   Identical twins Charlene Reavis and
Darlene Elsey, were sharing a room again, just as they did when
they were children 22 years ago.
   But this time it was a hospital room, where the Aurora sisters
were both cuddling newborn infants.
   Dillon Cole Reavis was born Saturday and his cousin, Tara Brooke
Elsey, was born Monday. Both babies were delivered at St. John's
Regional Health Center, where their mothers shared a recovery room.
   ``We're used to sharing a room,'' Mrs. Elsey said Tuesday.
``This is just like being at home _ fighting over the TV and
sharing the bathroom.
   ``After Charlene had her baby on the 23rd, I just called up the
hospital and told them to reserve the next bed for me.''
   Mrs. Reavis noted that the coincidence wasn't quite complete.
   ``She broke our chain,'' she said, pointing to her twin. ``She
had a girl.''

<HEAD>Rebels Split as Talks Start</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan rebel leaders headed into talks
today with their negotiating position weakened by a split between
military and political chieftains, according to U.S. and other
sources.
   The Contra chain of command remains intact only because an
attempt by veteran rebel leader Adolfo Calero to oust military
commander Enrique Bermudez a week ago was unsuccessful, the sources
said.
   The dispute between Calero and Bermudez has been simmering for
years and came to a head following the temporary truce signed last
month by the rebels and Nicaragua's leftist government.
   A U.S. official said that at a meeting last week in Honduras,
the five Contra directors split 2-2 with one abstention on a
proposal for Bermudez's removal. Another source said he was not
aware a formal vote had been taken.
   Bermudez ostensibly takes orders from the five-member civilian
directorate but believes he should have more influence over the
decision-making process, according to the sources.
   Calero has maintained that civilian control over the movement is
essential and sees Bermudez as a threat to that objective.
   According to a U.S. official, it would be a mistake to have
ousted Bermudez because ``he is the glue which holds the movement
together.'' With Bermudez gone, the official said, the Contras
would splinter and cease to be a credible fighting force.
   The sources, all of whom insisted on anonymity, said the
mistrust among the Contra leaders is expected to weaken their
negotiating position at this week's talks in Managua.
   Although Bermudez has expressed support publicly for the peace
process, the sources said he believes the agreement signed a month
ago put the rebel fighters at a severe disadvantage.
   The Sandinista government and the Contras agreed to a 60-day
cease-fire and to try to negotiate a permanent settlement.
   Thus far, the two sides have agreed on the location of seven
cease-fire zones to which the Contras would transfer once ground
rules for activities in these areas were spelled out.
   But as today's talks were getting under way, this remained a key
area of disagreement and the Contras have yet to resettle in the
designated zones.
   Meanwhile, Organization of American States Secretary General
Joao Baena Soares has written to Secretary of State George P.
Shultz that he believes U.S. food shipments to Contra rebels based
in Honduras are illegal.
   Baena Soares is a member of the commission assigned to verify
compliance with the temporary truce.
   The dispute involves $47.9 million in humanitarian assistance
approved by Congress four weeks ago after the Contras and the
Sandinistas signed their agreement.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development was assigned the
task of managing the aid program and has sent 125.6 metric tons of
food by truck to Contra camps in Honduras starting last week.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused the United States
last Friday of concealing weapons and ammunition in the shipments.
   AID denied that allegation, asserting the trucks were inspected
and found to be free of lethal equipment by members of the Honduran
clergy before the trucks departed the Honduran capital of
Tegucigalpa.
   The Sandinista government insists that inspections can be
carried out only by the verification commission.
   In his letter to Shultz, Baena Soares said he believes the
shipments ``do not fall within the provision of the instruments
which regulate the deliveries of humanitarian assistance.''
   An AID official, speaking Wednesday only on condition of
anonymity, said there was nothing in last month's agreement or the
aid legislation which would preclude delivery of assistance to
rebels in Honduras.
   The administration also has been worried about signs of
increasing hunger among the thousands of rebel fighters. Many have
crossed into Honduras from Nicaragua in recent weeks in search of
food.

<HEAD>Arms Control Restrictions Figure In Pentagon Budget Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats say they are are pushing for
arms control restrictions opposed by President Reagan as ``a way of
keeping the lid on the nuclear arms race.''
   But Republicans such as Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., argue
that the restrictions ``have long been overtaken by events.''
   The fight is over Democratic-backed proposals which are being
considered as the House debates and votes on the annual bill
authorizing the Pentagon budget.
   The restriction have been added for the past three years by the
House and while some were later dropped during the lengthy
congressional budget process, several remained.
   ``We're pushing these things because we need to keep the
pressure on, keep pushing the White House,'' said Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., said the restrictions ``are a way of
keeping the lid on the nuclear arms race.''
   On Wednesday, the House:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Voted, 252-159, to ban any tests of Star Wars anti-missile
defense systems which would violate the ``narrow'' interpretation
of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   _Voted, 240-174, for a ban on spending for any weapons that
would violate the numerical restrictions on various types of atomic
weapons that are contained in the 1979 SALT II treaty. President
Reagan says the Soviets are violating the unratified treaty and he
won't be guided any longer by its restrictions.
   The House is also likely to approve restrictions on testing of
anti-satellite weapons and ban all but the smallest U.S. nuclear
tests, Aspin noted. Both amendments were also approved last year.
   Legislators on both sides noted that the amendments are
virtually the same as the House has considered in past debates over
the Pentagon bill.
   ``President Reagan is committed to arms control and he has
proved it, convincingly, and everybody has to acknowledge that,''
said Broomfield.
   He referred to the treaty signed by Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev Dec. 8 which eliminates medium-range nuclear
missiles, and to negotiations aimed at achieving a more
far-reaching pact calling for deep reductions in long-range atomic
weapons.
   Referring to Democratic critics of Reagan, Broomfield said:
``Many of these true believers have been unable to recognize these
new realities...Some of these amendments are three years old. It's
time to put them out of their misery.''
   But Aspin noted that ``the House is a partisan body and there
are a lot of people here who feel very strongly about these
issues.''
   He suggested that the restrictions have had an impact. ``For
example, I think we would have violated the SALT II limits by much
more than we have without the pressure from Congress.''
   Reagan said 18 months ago that the United States would no longer
be restricted by the SALT II limits.
   The restrictions were tacked onto a bill authorizing $299.5
billion in Pentagon spending for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1.
The total is about the same as this year's defense budget and it
resulted from last December's ``budget summit'' between Reagan and
Congress which was designed to lower the federal budget deficit.
   The bill that passes the House will have to be reconciled with
the separate measure which will be passed by the Senate. That
chamber is moving more slowly on the Pentagon budget, which is now
being written by the Senate Armed Services Committee.

<HEAD>Strengthened Legislation Against Housing Discrimination Clears
Committee</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two primary sponsors of fair housing
legislation say they believe the full House will act quickly on the
measure, which would strengthen the ability of the government to
fight housing discrimination.
   Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said he would seek to send the bill to the
floor within the next couple of weeks.
   ``This is a priority item,'' Rodino said Wednesday after the
committee approved the legislation 26-9.
   ``Realistically, we hope to have it up on the floor in two or
three weeks,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the
Judiciary civil and constitutional subcommittee. ``This is civil
rights legislation and this is an election year.''
   Like legislation in 1980 that was derailed by the Senate, the
House measure would empower the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to levy fines and issue injunctions against those who
discriminate in the sale or rental of housing.
   Currently, HUD can only attempt to mediate disputes. The Justice
Department can bring suits against individuals for a pattern of
housing discrimination, and private individuals can bring their own
lawsuits if they feel aggrieved.
   Wednesday's vote came after three days of meetings in which the
Democratic-controlled committee fought off Republican efforts to
gut or weaken the fair housing legislation.
   Senate sponsors of a similar measure, which passed the Judiciary
Committee there nearly a year ago, don't want to move until the
House has completed its work. If the measure is to have any chance
of passage this year, the House must act promptly.
   The Reagan administration agrees that the housing laws need a
better enforcement mechanism but opposes the plan in the bill. The
measure would establish administrative law judges within the
Justice Department who would hear cases of alleged discrimination
and then impose remedies.
   The administration, the National Association of Realtors and
their allies in Congress, led by Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,
R-Wis., say this approach may be unconstitutional because it could
result in the imposition of a stiff penalty without a jury trial.

<TEXT>
   The step-by-step search for a defense in space
against Soviet ballistic missiles is on track and the first phase
of the Star Wars program will be technically deployable between
1995 and 2000, a senior U.S. negotiator said today.
   In a prepared speech to a major defense contractors group,
Edward L. Rowny said research ``is not only alive but healthy and
thriving'' in such areas as developing technology that can
discriminate between Soviet decoys and nuclear warheads targeted on
the United States.
   Rowny, who advises President Reagan and Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, disputed published reports that the
administration was scaling back the program, known formally as the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Recently, he said, six key SDI technologies were approved by
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci for demonstration tests to
validate they would help shield the country from Soviet ballistic
missile attack.
   He acknowledged that an unpublished report by Congress' Office
of Technology Assessment last July identified some ``gaps'' in Star
Wars technology. But Rowny, a former Army lieutenant general who
has participated in negotiations for 20 years, said development has
moved quickly in the nine months since the report was submitted to
the Pentagon.
   As an example, he cited an experiment known as Delta 181 that
discriminated between decoys and warheads.
   Rowny said a high-level panel directed by Robert Everett,
chairman of the Pentagon's senior scientific advisory group, had
recommended proceeding ``step-by-step as technology is developed''
for the Star Wars program.
   Rowny, addressing a meeting of the American Defense Preparedness
Association, urged the contractors ``to get the truth out about
SDI.''
   He criticized reports in The Washington Post that the Pentagon
was sharply scaling back its efforts to fulfill President Reagan's
dream of rendering ballistic missiles ``impotent and obsolete''
with a space-based defense against them.
   Rowny said reports of SDI's demise were ``dead wrong,'' But, he
said, progress in key areas will be slowed or aborted if Congress
continues to fund the program below required levels.
   The first phase of the program would use kinetic energy and
other futuristic technology to provide a partial defense against
nuclear missiles.
   Rowny said deployment would ``greatly complicate'' the ability
of Soviet military planners to executive a successful first strike
of ballistic nuclear missiles against the United States.
   Critics contend the program is fanciful, extremely expensive and
a major stumbling block in negotiations with the Soviet Union to
reduce long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Reagan hopes to sign a treaty with General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev at the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in Moscow. But Rowny
said the Soviets were ``still trying to hold offensive reductions
hostage to U.S. compliance with Soviet-defined limits on certain
strategic defense research.''
   He referred to the stand taken by the Soviets that the treaty
contain a provision authorizing a suspension of the weapons
reductions if Moscow concluded the Star Wars program violated the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   The Reagan administration has dismissed the demand as
unacceptable.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz plans a final pre-summit
meeting with Soviet Foreign Secretary Eduard A. Shevardnadze in
Moscow May 11-12.
   Rowny said the Soviets were pursuing a defense program that
costs an estimated $20 billion or so a year, including programs
investigating many of the same advanced strategic defense
technologies being explored in SDI.

<HEAD>High-Voltage Research: When Lightning Strikes, This Team Is There</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   W. David Rust doesn't mind when people liken
his research to that of Benjamin Franklin, who pioneered lightning
studies with a risky method involving a kite, a string and a key.
   Rust's methods are a bit more modern, but only a little less
dramatic.
   When a violent thunderstorm threatens the nation's midsection,
Rust and his fellow scientists set off in hot pursuit. The aim: To
send weather balloons carrying packets of instruments into the
heart of an electrical storm.
   By measuring the the overall electricity in the storms, and the
charge on individual raindrops, scientists hope to learn about the
the differences in behavior between large and small storms, said
Rust, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   That, in turn, can help in predicting what the storms will do
and in issuing warnings, Rust said in a telephone interview from
the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla.
   Rust said he hopes the work will help lead to better forecasts,
``bridging the gap between basic ivory-tower research and
applications.''
   Few would confuse his workplace with an ivory tower.
   This year's effort gets under way ``at the next storm which, if
we're lucky, will be tomorrow,'' he said Wednesday.
   He will lead a seven-man team in a pair of vehicles, chasing the
huge storms that sweep across the middle of America hammering away
with lightning and tornadoes.
   When one is reported, the team sets forth in a truck carrying an
already inflated balloon in a box structure, and a van which has
been gutted and refitted with an array of instruments.
   They try to locate the area under just the towering anvil cloud,
and there they set the balloon free.
   The balloon is pulled into a large plastic tube to help hold it
steady until release. (The team has released balloons in winds of
more than 50 miles per hour.) Usually the balloon has to be pulled
to an area away from trees and electrical wires.
   Once aloft, the balloon is tracked by radio instruments.
   Rust said lightning can interfere with the signals sometimes,
though most data gets through.
   And some balloons become casualties of a trip into the storm, he
said.
   Last year, when the research was started, one balloon
disappeared ``in conjunction with a lightning flash'' in the cloud,
Rust said. And others have been battered back to the ground by hail
swirling around in the storm. But most survive to send back
information.
   The project was launched last summer, with Rust and Dr. Tom
Marshall of the University of Mississippi seeking to follow up
studies of small storms done earlier in New Mexico.
   Two types of balloons are being used this year, small 4-foot
diameter balloons with instruments to measure the general
electrical field in the storm, and larger 6- or 7-foot versions to
measure the charge on individual raindrops.
   ``Measurements like that have never been made in severe
storms,'' Rust said.
   ``We're trying to understand the electric structure of
thunderstorms, in particular severe thunderstorms.... We want to
know if they are significantly different from small thunderstorms
or not.''
   The large storms have some unusual lightning characteristics, he
explained, and the scientists want to know if that is tied into the
rainfall patterns of the storms, which is one reason they want to
measure the electrical charge on raindrops.
   Severe storms tend to have a much higher share of intra-cloud
lightning than smaller storms, Rust explained, adding that this
seems to be associated with intensification of the circulation in
the storm and possibly with formation of tornadoes.
   In addition, the severe storms sometimes produce lightning
strikes to the ground with a positive charge, rather than the
negative charge more commonly found in lightning, he said.
   There can be too much lightning, though, even for Rust. He
admits having scrubbed a few launches last year when he considered
it too dangerous.
   ``We are very cautious when releasing a balloon in a storm
environment,'' he said. ``We try to use good judgment.''

<HEAD>Nurse: Liberace Gravely Ill On Day Signed Final Will</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>

   Liberace seemed childlike two weeks
before he died and was so ill he could barely speak and couldn't
put on his glasses or read, let alone approve of changes in his
will, said the nurse who cared for him.
   The flamboyant entertainer, who died Feb. 5, 1987, of
AIDS-related complications, was a gaunt man who used what little
energy he had left to smile at friends when they came to see him,
Norma Gerber testified Wednesday.
   ``It was just the disease, it knocked everything out of him,''
said the nurse, who began caring for Liberace 13 days before his
death and the day he named attorney Joel Strote as his executor.
   ``We would have minature conversations but he could only speak
in syllables,'' she said. ``The motor coordination was going so
he'd have difficulty speaking.''
   Her testimony contradicted that of Strote, who said the famed
pianist sat at a table in his Palm Strings, Calif., home that day,
talking with him and going over the estate papers before signing
them.
   Liberace's sister, his former manager, two housekeepers and a
long-time friend, have filed suit to remove Strote as executor with
full control of the estimated $20 million estate.
   ``He'd say yes to anything to please (at that point),'' said
Gerber. ``He just wanted to please anyone and be left alone.''
   ``He was so childlike he didn't know what he was saying,'' she
said in describing the entertainer's dying days at his Palm Springs
home.
   According to provisions of the will made public Wednesday, three
of the five received more in the death-bed will Strote drew up than
in a will Liberace executed in 1982.
   Under the revised will, Liberace gave $650,000 to his sister,
Angie; $250,000 to his companion of seven years, Cary James;
$60,000 to Seymour Heller, his manager for 37 years, and $5,000 to
Dorothy McMahon, the housekeeper at his Palm Springs home.
   He also left James two expensive cars and gave a house,
furnishings and a car to the fifth plaintiff, Gladys Luckie, the
housekeeper at his Las Vegas home.
   James was not named in Liberace's previous will and Angie
Liberace was to receive $450,000 under the 1982 document. Ms.
Luckie, who had been given the right to live in one of Liberace's
homes in the 1982 will, was given the house outright in the 1987
document.
   Liberace also left $50,000 in trust to take care of his seven
dogs, which he often referred to as his ``babies.''
   Strote has said that he has received more than $400,000 in legal
fees from the estate and the Liberace trust and is billing his
services, including his time at the current trial, at $250 an hour.
   In his fourth day of testimony Wednesday, Strote said $900,000
of the money owed the five plaintiffs had been set aside. Strote
said he would seek to have the plaintiffs pay the extensive legal
costs of the will litigation out of the $900,000 if the judge rules
in his favor.
   Strote defended the signing of the will and two trusts in the
days before Liberace died, and a doctor who examine the entertainer
was convinced Liberace was ``in good condition and could
understand'' the documents, Strote said.
   ``I wanted to make sure he was physically able to go through the
documents and understand them,'' Strote said.
   Strote said Liberace signed the will and two trusts, but balked
at a fourth document, a living will that would allow doctors to
remove life support systems if they became necessary.
   ``He said `I just can't sign this,''' Strote recalled.

   A school bus carrying 52 people veered
off a highway and plunged into a ditch when the driver lost control
on a curve. Police said two children were killed and 40 injured.
   The accident happened Wednesday near Volterra, a medieval Tuscan
hill town. A boy and a girl were crushed to death and 40 people,
most of them 15- and 16-year-old students from Rome's Plauto high
school, were injured. The Italian news agency AGI said five people
were hurt seriously.
   The injured were flown by helicopter to a hospital in Pisa,
while others were taken by ambulance to a hospital in Volterra.
   Those aboard included 48 students, two teachers, the driver and
the driver's son. A teacher said the students were on a two-day
field trip.

   Washington is paying tribute this week to the
first lady who helped dress the city in its spring finery of
blooming tulips and blossoming dogwoods.
   Lady Bird Johnson ``deserves the national applause and
appreciation for what she's done for the country,'' says David
Northington, executive director of the National Wildflower Research
Center in Austin, Texas.
   Separate ceremonies were planned today in the House, Senate and
White House Rose Garden to honor Mrs. Johnson, wife of former
president Lyndon Johnson and founder of the wildflower center.
   More events are planned Friday marking her 75th birthday, which
she celebrated this past December.
   ``It think it's very fitting,'' Northington said Wednesday.
``This celebration is about all she's done.''
   Mrs. Johnson said earlier this month she was inspired to
beautify Washington as first lady after returning from trips abroad
with her husband.
   She said flowers light up a city the way lipstick does a woman,
and her interests in beautifying the environment widened with the
years: from the traffic circles and public buildings in Washington
to the coasts and the heartlands in between.
   With a donation of 60 acres east of Austin and $125,000, Mrs.
Johnson in 1982 helped found the National Wildflower Research
Center, an information clearinghouse where research is done on the
role of native wildflowers in landscaping along the nation's
roadways.
   Proceeds from the Jubilee Celebration will benefit the center,
Northington said. Activities include a black-tie dinner tonight, a
luncheon Friday at the Watergate Hotel with leaders of the
Washington community, a national concert and a reception by the
Texas State Society and members of the Texas congressional
delegation.
   ``The best way to honor her is to give a gift to something she
started _ it is a little bit of everything that she's done all her
life,'' Northington said.
   Proceeds will go to an endowment that supports research into the
conservation and use of wildflowers and native plants, he said.
   Mrs. Johnson has led the way in the planting of native
wildflowers along roadways, and Northington said her efforts have
``really spread like wildflowers.''

   A court ordered the seizure of
property worth $10 million from three men accused of being members
of a Mexican narcotics ring, a newspaper reported.
   Judge Ivan Rincon Urdaneta ordered the seizures and freezed the
suspects' bank accounts after Venezuelan officials determined the
assets were bought with money from drug sales, El Nacional
newspaper said Wednesday.
   The property in Maracaibo, a city 360 miles west of Caracas,
includes a 1,200-acre ranch, a large home and a U.S.-registered
twin-engine plane.
   The property seized was traced to Jose Contreras Subias, Jose
Felix Gallardo and Socorro Leon Ojeda, who used false passports to
enter Venezuela in 1984, the newspaper said.
   Contreras Subias was arrested on drug charges recently by U.S.
officials in Utah. The other two men were being sought.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
turned down an invitation by East German Communist Party leader
Erich Honecker to attend a conference in East Berlin next month, a

   Honecker sent invitations to leaders of all major West German
political parties to attend a conference in East Berlin June 20-22
to discuss East bloc proposals for setting up a nuclear
weapons-free zone in Europe.
   Kohl, who heads West Germany's Christian Democratic Union Party,
decided not to attend, party spokesman Juergen Merschmeier told
reporters in Bonn on Wednesday.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic
Party, is the only major West German party leader expected to
attend the conference, although no decision has been announced.

<HEAD>Faulty Brake Said To Have Caused Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal railroad regulators say an accident
that killed a veteran conductor last year and led to an ongoing
rail strike in New England was caused by a faulty brake.
   The Nov. 9, 1987, accident at the Lawrence, Mass., freight yard
has been at the center of a labor dispute between Guilford
Transportation Industries and unionized workers who charged that
inexperience of a newly hired engineer led to the fatal accident.
   About 1,200 rail workers walked off the job three days after the
accident to protest allegedly unsafe working conditions on the
freight line. The strike, in its sixth month, is against Maine
Central and Boston & Maine lines now under Springfield Terminal Co.
   ``Both sides have attempted to use the tragedy to their
advantage, and the irony is that the report really doesn't support
either position,'' FRA Administrator John Reilly said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
   ``The company is clearly liable for the faulty repair on the
hand brake,'' said, but added, ``We found nothing to support the
labor allegation that lack of experience or training by the
engineer contributed to the accident.''
   FRA investigators were unable to conclude if Richard Hopkinson,
the veteran conductor and head of the three-member crew, properly
blocked the boxcar to prevent it from moving.
   But the report said once the boxcar began to move, Hopkinson
applied the hand brake without success. Reilly said a working brake
would have stopped the boxcar and prevented the tragedy, and that
the problem could have caused the initial runaway.
   Investigators discovered that Boston & Maine repair crews failed
to install the necessary weld on the brake system during repairs
earlier in the year.
   After realizing the brake failure, Hopkinson _ who was on the
runaway car _ radioed instructions to the engineer to speed up to
the boxcar so the conductor could attempt to couple the two cars,
which were moving at speeds that reached up to 25 mph.
   The report said the engineer, who joined the strike, did not
contribute to the accident.
   Eugene Lyden, vice president of the United Transportation Union,
said he believes the report incorrectly dismisses the engineer's
role in the accident.
   Guilford Vice President Colin Pease said the company was
``gratified'' by the report and agreed with its conclusions.

<HEAD>Israelis Increasingly Use Arabic Term For Uprising</HEAD>

   Many Israelis are using the Arabic word
``intefadah,'' or uprising, to describe the violent protests in the
occupied lands, and Jewish and Arab observers say the new
terminology reflects a new attitude.
   ``It's an acceptance of the fact that we're not just talking
about scattered disturbances, but a struggle against the occupation
that involves everybody,'' said Palestinian editor Khaled Abu Aker.
   When Palestinian unrest began in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on
Dec. 8, Israeli journalists and army officials referred to the
clashes between Arab protesters and Israeli troops as
``disturbances.''
   Such language reflected the initial Israeli perception that only
a few activists, incited by outsiders, were involved in the
protests, while the majority of the Palestinians remained passive.
   But in the last few weeks, more and more Israelis, including
politicians and journalists, have spoken about ``intefadah'' when
describing the protests in which more than 170 Arabs and two
Israelis have been killed.
   In his Independence Day address to Arab residents last week,
President Chaim Herzog urged Palestinians to end the ``intefadah''
and said they must realize they are being misled by their leaders.
   A recent routine news item on Israel's armed forces radio read:
``Since the start of the intefadah, shopkeepers in east Jerusalem
have usually opened their shops for several hours in the
afternoon.''
   ``It's now part of the jargon. Everybody knows what intefadah
means,'' said Israeli journalist Joel Greenberg.
   ``The fact that they are using the Palestinian term means they
are accepting the Palestinian definition,'' added Greenberg, the
West Bank correspondent for the English-language Jerusalem Post
newspaper.
   Abu Aker, an editor at the pro-PLO newspaper Al-Fajr, noted that
in the first few weeks of the uprising, the Israeli censor
routinely blue-penciled the word ``intefadah'' in his articles.
   ``About three months ago, they began to accept the word, and we
now use it all the time,'' he said.
   Others rejected the political interpretation and said the use of
the word ``intefadah'' was just part of the lively exchange between
Hebrew and Arabic, two closely related Semitic languages.
   Hebrew and Arabic speakers in Israel and the occupied lands
often curse in the other's language and borrow greetings and terms
of endearment from one another.
   ``I don't think people go into the real meaning of the word
intefadah,'' said Herzog's spokesman, Ami Gluska. ``People use it
because they hear it.''

<HEAD>Committee Votes To Penalize Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru For Drugs</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Latin American Drugs Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru are failing to give
the United States full cooperation in the war on drugs, a House
committee said in voting to impose aid sanctions against the three
South American countries.
   The votes Wednesday by the Foreign Affairs Committee to penalize
the three countries were largely symbolic, since the legislation
will unlikely clear other procedural hurdles and be passed by
Congress before a May 13 deadline.
   But supporters said it would send a clear signal to the three
governments that the United States is serious about combating the
flow of illegal narcotics from abroad. And some hoped the move also
would score political points in their drug-plagued congressional
districts this election year.
   While the panel voted to impose aid sanctions on those three
countries, it declined to penalize Mexico or the Bahamas, both of
which have been criticized for not ``fully cooperating'' with U.S.
anti-drug efforts as the law requires.
   House Speaker Jim Wright was said by committee members to have
intervened to head off sanctions against Paraguay and Peru, which
had lobbied hard against the action.
   The Bolivia resolution passed 26-15, and the other two were
approved by voice votes.
   In backing the sanctions legislation, the panel ignored warnings
that penalties would only harm relations with allies and make it
more difficult to secure cooperation in fighting the flow of drugs
into the United States.
   ``Passing these resolutions would make us feel better,'' said
Rep. George Crockett, D-Mich., chairman of the Western Hemisphere
subcommittee. ``We could go home and tell our constituents we
struck a big blow against drugs.''
   But he said allies ``are tired of being treated like banana
republics by their great northern brother, the United States.''
   The chief sponsor of the sanctions bills, Rep. Larry Smith,
D-Fla., said they were the only way the United States has to get
the attention of countries which are the source of drugs pouring
into the United States.
   ``Only when we prod do we get any reaction,'' argued Smith, who
said Peru and Bolivia are the largest producers of coca leaves and
coca paste, used to make cocaine.
   Potentially at stake for Bolivia is half its foreign aid
package, for which a total of $55 million has been requested by the
administration for fiscal year 1989. Peru's 1989 administration aid
request is $20 million, and Paraguay's is $125,000.
   The Senate voted overwhelmingly on April 14 to revoke President
Reagan's certification that Mexico is fully cooperating with
anti-drug efforts, but voted against taking similar action on the
Bahamas. The certifications for the other three countries have not
been addressed in the Senate.
   Under a 1986 law, the president must certify annually that
countries on a State Department list of drug producing and
trafficking points are ``fully cooperating'' with U.S. anti-drug
efforts in order for them to receive continued U.S. aid.
   If the president does not make such a certification, the
countries can lose half their aid money, and can lose trade
preferences and support for loans from international development
banks. The president is given the power to head off sanctions by
certifying it is in U.S. security interests for aid to continue.
   Reagan certified March 1 that 17 of the 24 countries on the list
were fully cooperating, including the ones debated Wednesday in the
House committee. The president certified another three countries on
national security grounds, and withheld certification from just
three countries _ Afghanistan, Syria and Iran _ which get no U.S.
aid.

<TEXT>
   A generation after OPEC learned the
tricks of the oil trade from America, a self-styled envoy from the
heart of U.S. oil country has come to OPEC to see how the cartel
works.
   He's Kent Hance, a handsome, smooth-talking, 45-year-old former
U.S. congressman who currently is a member of the Texas Railroad
Commission, which regulates that state's large petroleum industry.
   Ensconced in his hotel room in central Vienna, Hance patiently
awaits word on a twice-postponed appointment to see Rilwanu Lukman,
the Nigerian oil minister who doubles as president of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC maintains its
headquarters in Vienna.
   Hance says OPEC is a friendly group that's ``glad to have
someone from the United States to have a dialogue with.'' But he
finds it hard to adapt to OPEC officials' disregard for time
schedules.
   He'd been told by Lukman's aides that he could see the minister
after an OPEC meeting that initially was set for 2 p.m., then
rescheduled for 3 p.m., then 4 p.m. The session finally started
about 5 p.m.
   He said he was still trying to adjust to what outsiders call
``OPEC time.''
   Hance sees his mission as ``opening a dialogue'' with the cartel
that many Americans view as an enemy of the West, and that the U.S.
government refuses to deal with.
   ``We're not in love with OPEC, but we need to have input'' into
decisions by an organization that controls about 35 percent of the
world's oil supplies, he said in an interview on Wednesday.
   ``I look at what's happened to our Texas economy'' since oil
prices crashed in 1986, he said. ``No one else is going to be
speaking up for the state of Texas, and someone had to do
something.''
   A Republican, he ackowledges that ``I'm subject to criticism''
for talking with OPEC about ways to stabilize oil prices, in
defiance of the stated wishes of the Reagan administration.
   He said the two other members of the Texas Railroad Commission
are ``too cautious'' to undertake such a controversial venture.
   ``I was the one who thought of this idea last fall,'' he said.
``If I think of something that might work, I'll take a risk.''
   Hance met on Monday with Fadhil Chabili, the OPEC deputy
secretary general who administers the cartel's secretariat. He also
held separate meetings with the oil ministers of Venezuela and
Indonesia, as well as with officials of non-OPEC oil-producing
countries such as Norway.
   Hance says he has been impressed by the OPEC oil ministers'
knowledge of the business.
   ``They have a good understanding of oil,'' he said. ``What they
just can't understand is why a country that is the No. 1 oil
consumer and the No. 2 producer doesn't have an energy policy.''
   Hance says the U.S. government should be in direct and regular
contact with OPEC as part of a national energy policy.
   ``If I were a farmer and I grew carrots, and that's all I did
and there was one entity, one person, in the world that set the
price of carrots, I would want to know that person and have some
input,'' he said.
   He says OPEC will become increasingly important to the United
States in the next decade. He predicted that 65 percent of American
oil supplies would be imported by 1992, up from 40 percent now.
   ``We have to have some imput ... rather than burying our heads
in the sand and hope OPEC treats us okay,'' he said. ``How have
they treated us without (U.S.) input? Not very well.''
   He rejects suggestions that the United States should not deal
with an organization whose market-rigging methods it dislikes.
   ``We don't agree with the Soviets. They're our enemies. But we
still have a dialogue with them.''

   Some of the nation's financial markets are
making changes aimed at reducing the risk of another collapse, but
the new procedures could instead prove harmful, the chief of
Congress' investigative agency says.
   Charles A. Bowsher, comptroller general of the General
Accounting Office, told the Senate Agriculture Committee on
Wednesday ways must be found to prevent a recurrence of last Oct.
19, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted a record 508
points.
   But he said that because the nation's stock, futures and options
markets are closely linked, unilateral changes by individual
exchanges are potentially dangerous.
   ``Because these changes have not been coordinated across
markets, they have potentially adverse implications for intermarket
stability,'' Bowsher told the lawmakers. ``These uncoordinated
changes greatly concern us.''
   As an example, Bowsher cited the limits in daily price swings
that the futures markets have adopted but that the stock markets
have not implemented. Supporters say the restrictions could stop
markets from overreacting during uncertain times, but opponents say
the limits could prevent investors from selling their holdings and
cause panic.
   Such a disparity could cause ``an adverse transfer of buying or
selling pressure'' from equity markets to the stock exchanges, he
said.
   Bowsher also complained there was still no structure to resolve
problems among the markets and develop a contingency plan to handle
the next emergency.
   ``Decisions about what constitutes a market emergency, the types
of actions to be taken and who will make the decisions are still
not clear,'' he said.
   A White House working group, consisting of the heads of four
federal agencies, is studying the problems faced by the nation's
stock and futures markets. Its eagerly awaited report is scheduled
for release on May 18.
   ``Because that solution has not yet emerged, the Congress should
continue to keep pressure on the various parties through continued
oversight so that progress toward a truly coordinated solution
remains on track,'' Bowsher told the committee.
   Panel Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., circulated a proposed bill
in February that would have created an Intermarket Coordinating
Council made up of the chiefs of the same agencies named to the
White House group: the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board,
Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
   While saying he is willing to let federal and industry groups
work out solutions to the market's ills, Leahy said, ``If the
spirit of cooperation breaks down, if they fail to make progress,
then I'm prepared to force action with legislation.''
   The ranking Republican on the Agriculture Committee, Sen.
Richard Lugar of Indiana, complained that small investors are still
too frightened to invest in the market six months after the
so-called Black Monday and no single overseer has been created to
prevent future crashes.
   ``The whole pace has been extraordinarily leisurely, given the
seriousness of the problem,'' Lugar said.

   An unarmed missile blasted off today
and hit its target thousands of miles away in the 10th successful
test launching of a Trident 2 submarine missile, the Navy said.
   The 44-foot, three-stage missile, which has a 6,000-mile range,
roared off a land pad at 12:52 a.m. and propelled the warhead to
the target in the Atlantic. The Navy didn't say exactly where the
target was located.
   The only failure in the test launchings occurred Jan. 21 when
the third stage had an electronic problem. Today's launch was the
second since then.
   Trident 2 is an intercontinental range missile, which is
scheduled to become operational late in 1989 after nine more
launch-pad tests and between five and 10 submarine test firings off
the coast here.
   Each Trident submarine will pack 24 missiles, each of which will
be able to hurl 10 nuclear warheads to different targets.

<HEAD>World Population Could Double In 40 Years, Research Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world population could double to more than
10 billion people within four decades, say researchers who contend
previous predictions of a slowdown appear to be wrong.
   ``The overall world population is growing faster than had been
projected in the late 1970s and early '80s,'' said Carl Haub of the
private Population Reference Bureau.
   The next billion could be added by 1998, said Haub, adding,
``That's really fast.''
   The World Population Data Sheet, issued Wednesday by the bureau,
said the doubling would occur if world population continues to grow
at the current rate of 1.7 percent.
   It took all of human history to raise the world's population to
1 billion, which occurred in the early 1800s _ during the
presidency of Thomas Jefferson.
   More than a century was required to add the second billion, by
about 1930, according to the United Nations Fund for Population
Activities. Three billion were here by 1964, 4 billion in 1974 and
5 billion in 1987.
   There is a perception that world population growth was a problem
of the 1970s, Haub observed in a telephone interview, ``so we
thought it was time to point out that it's still growing faster
than had been projected.''
   The 1.7 percent rate of annual growth given by the Bureau, an
independent, non-profit research group, is slightly higher than the
1.6 percent projected by the United Nations.
   ``That doesn't sound like much,'' Haub pointed out. But in a
world of 5 billion people, that difference represents 5 million
more people per year.
   Population growth hasn't followed the smooth trend downward that
had been expected in many developing nations, Haub said. He noted
in particular that China, India, Pakistan and Iran have high growth
rates.
   ``Some of the larger countries have not followed a nice smooth
path to the two-child family that we have been predicting,'' said
Haub, noting in particular China and India, where previous
reductions in births have not been maintained.
   The doubling of the world population in 40 years depends on
growth continuing at the 1.7 percent ate, Haub said, a rate that
varies considerably from country-to-country and region-to-region.
   The more developed nations, for example, are growing at 0.6
percent annually, for an anticipated doubling time of 120 years,
the Population Data Sheet shows. On the other hand, the less
developed nations could double in just 33 years, at a growth rate
of 2.1 percent.
   Increasing fastest are Kenya and the disputed territory of Gaza,
currently occupied by Israel, each of which is expected to double
its population in just 17 years at current rates of increase.
   At the other end of the scale, five countries are not growing at
all _ Austria, Denmark, Hungary, East Germany and West Germany. And
Italy, at its current rate, would not double its population for
3,465 years.
   Changes are hard to anticipate as various nations progress
economically toward what population experts call the demographic
transition.
   In early societies, high birth rates are generally balanced high
death rates. As economic conditions provide better medical care and
nutrition, death rates fall while birth rates remain high, leading
to rapid population growth.
   Eventually, history shows, birth rates also begin to fall in a
transition to balance again, as has happened in many more developed
nations.
   Social, religions and other differences from nation to nation,
however, keep this change from being a smooth curve, and help lead
to the many variations around the world.

<HEAD>Study: Three-Day Hospital Stays Enough for Some Heart Attack
Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New treatments that stop a heart attack in its
tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly
than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a
study published today concludes.
   Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied
the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home
early. They found that these people had no unusual complications,
got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.
   ``It was an extraordinarily safe strategy,'' said Dr. Eric J.
Topol, the study's director. ``There were no problems with any
serious events.''
   Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent
medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and
angioplasty.
   When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clots
in the heart's arteries and minimize damage. Angioplasty can
produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with
tiny balloons.
   The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trend
of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever
shorter stays.
   However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said
more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted.
   In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay in
bed for one to two months after a heart attack. When President
Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in
1955, he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital.
   However, doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than
good. Patients got out of shape, developed blood clots and became
demoralized.
   In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the
1970s to two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attack
patients hospitalized seven to 10 days.
   In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart
attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for
early discharge. None of them had irregular heart beats, chest pain
or heart failure. Treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack
damage.
   Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the rest
stayed seven to 10 days. After six months of followup, none had
died, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar.
   However, people in the early discharge group were able to return
to work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medical
bills were significantly lower _ $12,546 versus $17,868.
   The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack
patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would
be at least $280 million.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputy
editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large
enough to spot complications that might result from reducing
hospital stays.
   ``This single study,'' he wrote, ``is not sufficient to justify
sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients
who may at first appear to have uncomplicated'' heart attacks.

<HEAD>Candidate Rejects Duarte Call To Abandon Presidential Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A contender for the
presidential nomination of the governing Christian Democratic Party
rejected President Jose Napoleon Duarte's suggestion he abandon the
race for the sake of party unity.
   Julio Rey Prendes said on Wednesday that he would continue to
seek the nomination for the March 1989 elections. The party's
nominating convention, which Rey is thought to control, is
scheduled for Friday.
   Duarte is limited by law to one five-year term.
   In a broadcast message Tuesday night, Duarte urged Rey and
archrival Fidel Chavez Mena to step aside in the name of party
unity. Duarte suggested the party close ranks around a third
candidate, Abraham Rodriguez.
   Rey said the convention was the only legal mechanism for
deciding the Christian Democratic candidacy. He referred to Duarte
as ``one member of the party.''
   He said he met with Duarte on Wednesday morning and that as soon
as he left the president's office, Chavez entered.
   Rey and Chavez, both party founders and former cabinet
ministers, have expressed confidence they will be selected at the
convention.
   At least two party activists have been killed and several
wounded in confrontations between followers of Rey and Chavez since
the internal campaign began last May.
   Duarte cited the infighting as a principal reason for the
Christian Democrats' loss to the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance in legislative and municipal elections March 20.
   The alliance, popularly known by its Spanish acronym Arena,
replaced the Christian Democrats as the majority party in the
legislature and won two-thirds of the mayoralties nationwide.
   ``Today our existence is threatened from within the party,''
Duarte said.
   ``The future of democracy in El Salvador is conditioned on the
future of the Christian Democratic Party. There is no truly
democratic opponent in the elections of 1989,'' the president added.
   The only other party expected to field a presidential candidate
is the National Conciliation Party, a small conservative group.
   Duarte, who is also the party's honorary president, said the
candidacy of Chavez or Rey ``would lead us to an electoral failure
with grave implications for the democratic development of the
country.''
   He suggested Rodriguez, also among those who founded the party
in 1960, as a unity candidate.

   Chunks of shrapnel from unexplained explosions
are hurtling through space at 22,000 mph and forcing designers to
add tons of shielding to protect the proposed U.S. space station
and its crew.
   Nearly 7,100 pieces of orbiting debris are being tracked by the
U.S. Space Command and more than half came from satellites or spent
rockets that ``have blown up or broken up for unknown reasons,'' a
NASA expert says.
   More than 90 satellites to date have shattered unaccountably,
but Don Kessler, project scientist for debris studies at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, said he doubts the cause is
collisions with meteoroids or tests of secret anti-satellite
weapons.
   ``They are like a time bomb waiting to explode,'' Kessler said
in a telephone interview. ``These explosions have occurred
everywhere, from one day (after launch) to three years.''
   Space station planners, ``faced with a considerable design
problem,'' are adding 2,000 pounds to the shielding of each of the
six modules occupied by astronauts.
   ``The debris gets most severe at 500-600 miles,'' Kessler said,
``but usually unmanned spacecraft are at that altitude and don't
require the same level of safety as a crew.'' The space shuttle
generally operates at altitudes of 150 to 300 miles and so will the
space station.
   ``When I first started working in this area, very few people
knew how their spacecraft were breaking up, including the
designers,'' Kessler said. ``The Space Command knew they were
breaking up, but never took the time to identify why.''
   He said officials have long believed that French-made Ariane
rockets explode in space but their orbits are difficult to track
with ground radar. Two years ago, however, an Ariane was launched
into an easy-to-track orbit and, Kessler said, ``it blew up after
nine months.'' The fragments of that explosion _ probably caused by
over pressurization of gases _ number 450.
   Americans and Soviets contribute to the space junk, too. Six
U.S. Delta rocket second stages exploded, the last in 1981 _ three
years after it was launched. The cause was leakage of fuels that
burn when they combine and the problem was fixed in later models.
   Such explosions cause an expanding cloud of debris _ ``a problem
analogous to cars driving around a parking lot in random directions
_ you can get hit from any direction and the most likely direction
will be head-on,'' Kessler said.
   The $1 billion space telescope scheduled to be put into orbit
next year will operate 300 miles high. A study by the Space
Telescope Institute concluded the instrument should be designed
differently because of the debris, he said.
   Maj. Alex Mondragon of the U.S. Space Command in Colorado
Springs, Colo., said 5,331 pieces of debris and 1,759 ``working
payloads'' were being tracked as of April 19. The objects ranged in
size from the Soviet Mir space station to a screwdriver dropped by
a spacewalking astronaut.
   Space shuttle Challenger returned from a mission in June 1983
with a chip in a cockpit window and chemical analysis showed the
culprit was a flake of the paint used on rockets and payloads.
   The few objects returned from space all have shown debris
damage. The Palapa and Westar satellites that were retrieved by a
space shuttle crew were pitted, but not damaged enough to keep them
from functioning. The Solar Max satellite, repaired in orbit,
showed many hits _ some penetrating an insulation blanket and
damaging the surface beneath.
   ``A 3 millimeter particle has as much kinetic energy as a
bowling ball going 60 miles an hour and if it hit an electrical
component, it would probably cause that system to cease
functioning,'' Kessler said. The average collision velocity would
be 22,000 mph, he said.

<TEXT>
   Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling is
being investigated by two U.S. grand juries probing payoffs by drug
traffickers, The Washington Times reported today.
   The newspaper, quoting sources it did not identify, said grand
juries in Miami and Jacksonville, Fla., have heard testimony from
witnesses who claim Pindling received payments from cocaine
traffickers to ensure safe passage of the drug through the Bahamas.
   Pindling, in an interview with the Times, denied the allegation.
He said the Bahamian government has been working for years to stem
the flow of illegal drugs.
   ``The allegations against me are not true,'' he said. ``I would
hate to think that anyone truly believes I am a crook.''
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami did not
return telephone inquiries Wednesday about the case, the newspaper
said, while a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office in
Jacksonville declined to comment.
   The Times said documents it had inspected indicated that,
between January 1977 and December 1983, Pindling deposited into his
personal banks accounts $3.5 million over his official income as
prime minister.
   However, it also said two out of three commissioners on a panel
named in the Bahamas in 1984 to investigate allegations against
Pindling found ``no credible evidence'' linking him to drug-related
corruption.

<HEAD>Study Finds Chubby People Have Sluggish Nervous Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New evidence that chubby people have sluggish
nervous systems may help explain one of the great injustices of
dieting _ why some people burn up calories more quickly than others.
   The study published today supports the theory that many fat
people get that way because their bodies are extra-fuel efficient.
   Earlier research has documented that obese men and women often
have lower metabolic rates. Their bodies use up less energy, even
when they are doing the same things as ordinary-size people. So
they need less food.
   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine and
directed by Dr. Hugh R. Peterson of the University of Louisville,
may help explain at least part of how this happens. It shows that
the fatter people are, the more lethargic their sympathetic nervous
system, the internal thermostat that revs up the body in times of
danger, stress or exertion.
   ``Their findings are consistent with recent evidence that
indicates there is a biological difference between obese and
lean,'' said Dr. Lewis Landsberg of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital.
   ``This difference involves energy expenditure, and the
sympathetic nervous system is important in regulating energy
expenditure,'' he said. ``What they find shows diminished
sympathetic activity, and that works into the overall equation.''
   Dr. Jules Hirsch of Rockefeller University in New York agreed,
saying, ``It's another piece of the puzzle that's been unlocked.''
   Breathing, heart rate, contraction of the pupils and other
involuntary bodily movements are under the control of the autonomic
nervous system. This system has two main branches, the sympathetic
system and the parasympathetic system, which balance each other.
   In general, the sympathetic system speeds things up, often in
response to an emergency or exercise. The parasympathetic system
does just the opposite, slowing down the heart and other organs.
   The sympathetic system prompts production of adrenaline and
other hormones. Among other things, these natural chemicals signal
the body's fat cells to give up some of their cargo so it can be
burned as fuel.
   Peterson's study measured adrenaline levels, heart rates and
other factors under the control of the nervous system in 56 healthy
men of varying sizes. It showed that the fatter they were, the less
active their sympathetic nervous systems.
   Other scientists have tried but failed to find such differences
in fat people. Peterson said his findings should be replicated by
other scientists, and added that the possible meaning of his
findings is speculative.
   ``We have not proved that a disturbed autonomic nervous system
maintains or causes obesity or causes some of the health hazards of
obesity,'' he said. ``But certainly it's titillating to think that
might be the case.''
   Peterson found that the parasympathetic system _ the other half
of the internal control machinery _ is also turned down in fat
people. Under his theory, an active parasympathetic system might
help make people fat, while a lethargic one would keep them skinny.
   However, he theorizes that fat people have slow parasympathetic
systems as well to balance their sluggish sympathetic systems.
   ``They got fat and stayed fat because their sympathetic nervous
system tone was turned down,'' he said. ``As a response to that,
they were able to turn down their parasympathetic nervous systems
to reach a kind of equilibrium. That's quite speculative, but
that's the way we think about it.''

<HEAD>Critics Say Massachusetts Plant-Closing Law Touted By Dukakis
Lacks Teeth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis
has been wooing industrial-state voters by pointing to a
plant-closing law in his home state of Massachusetts, and praising
federal legislation requiring companies to notify workers 60 days
before a plant shuts down.
   But the federal law is considerably tougher than the
Massachusetts one, and that's the way the Massachusetts governor
wants it.
   The Massachusetts law requests _ but does not require _
companies to provide workers with 90 days warning before a plant
closing. Critics say the law lacks teeth.
   Dukakis' economic development adviser, Alden Raine, says a
notification requirement in Massachusetts alone might lead
companies to relocate, so Dukakis does not support such a plan.
   Because there is no notification requirement, Dukakis
administration officials can offer no evidence the Massachusetts
plant-closing provision has accomplished its goal.
   Dukakis says advance warning of plant closings is a basic worker
right.
   ``Anybody who doesn't understand that has really lost touch with
the American people,'' he said Wednesday in Springfield, Mass.
   President Reagan was in the same city last week, threatening to
veto the trade measure that includes the plant closing provision,
which won congressional approval on Wednesday.
   ``The irony is that he (Reagan) chose to deliver that speech in
the one state that has a comprehensive plant closing law,'' Dukakis
said.
   Christopher Donahue, a spokesman for the administration's
Industrial Services Program, could not say whether more companies
are providing 90-day notice now than were before the law took
effect.
   ``There's no way to know,'' he said. ``You can only suppose
we're doing better.''
   In recent campaign stops in Pennsylvania, however, Dukakis
contended the law ``has saved 20,000 jobs and 200 companies.''
   Dukakis defends his claim, saying troubled companies which
receive state assistance must sign a non-binding pledge to give
advance warning of plant closings. ``As a practical matter, there
are some very real sanctions for companies who fail to give
notice,'' he said.
   Former state Rep. Thomas Gallagher of Cambridge was a member of
the committee established by Dukakis in 1983 as a result of a
gubernatorial campaign promise to study the plant closing issue.
Dukakis and his top aides, Gallagher said, ``have been afraid of
the hue and cry the business community would put up if they were
ever treated roughly.''
   Indeed, industry lobbyist Richard Mastrangelo said at a
legislative hearing this week on toughening the state law, ``Does
this commonwealth wish to send the signal to every single employer
or potential employer that says, if you come into this state and
cannot survive economically, you will have to pay a penalty to get
out?''
   According to state officials, the plant closing law has not
``saved'' workers' jobs, but has helped some 24,000 find new
employment after plant closings. The state worker retraining and
relocation centers have found new jobs for about 77 percent of the
workers who sought help. The new jobs pay, on average, 92 percent
of their previous salaries.

   The De Beer diamond cartel said it will raise
prices for rough gemstones an average of 13.5 percent because a
weak dollar has increased demand for their products in Asia and
Europe.
   De Beers, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, controls 80
percent of the world's rough diamond market through its
London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization.
   Sales of diamonds are priced in dollars and have been boosted by
the drop in the U.S. currency, which makes them cheaper to holders
of Japanese yen and European currencies.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said the price increases for a
broad range of uncut diamonds will take effect May 3.
   ``The increases are not weighted toward any particular
category,'' said spokesman Richard Dickson.
   When De Beers last raised its prices, by an average 10 percent
on Oct. 5, the biggest increases were for better-quality diamonds.
That was the only price increase in 1987 and followed a jump of
14.5 percent, in two steps, in 1986.
   De Beers does not disclose its prices.
   But, as an example, the wholesale price of a polished,
one-carat, D-flawless diamond _ the highest grade _ costs about
$15,000.
   The cartel sets prices for rough diamonds only. It operates a
pipeline of diamonds from its mines in Africa and Australia to
dealers and cutters in the world's major diamond centers _ Antwerp,
Bombay, New York and Tel Aviv.
   ``The rough market is strong, the prices of polished diamonds
are strong, retail demand is good,'' Dickson said. ``Much of the
motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from Japan and
Southeast Asia.''
   De Beers enjoyed record sales of $3.075 billion in 1987, up 23
percent from sales of $2.5 billion in 1986.
   Diamond sales, which slumped in the early 1980s, jumped even
though De Beers cut supply after the Oct. 19 stock markets' crash,
Dickson said.
   ``We carried that cautious policy through the early part of
1988. We reacted very quickly. What we wouldn't want to do is sell
diamonds that the market couldn't absorb.''
   Jewelry sales generally were strong at Christmas, he added.
   ``The mood is optimistic and we would look foreward to 1988
being a good year,'' said Dickson.
   De Beers holds about 10 ``sights'' _ or sales _ for
international diamond dealers a year, Dickson said.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
mainly for drilling because they are so hard. From 10 percent to 20
percent are gems.

   Hospital death rates in states with tight-fisted
governmental controls are up to 10 percent higher, according to a
study published today that prompted one doctor to comment, ``You
can't have a Cadillac for Chevy prices.''
   The study suggests, but doesn't prove, that patient care suffers
because hospitals in more cost-regulated states may try to hold
down costs by laying off staff, eliminating services or spurning
expensive equipment.
   ``There is cause for some concern,'' said Stephen M. Shortell,
the study's director. ``There is no need to frighten the public,
but there is something here that does need to be dealt with.''
   In efforts to lower medical costs, many states have set up
review procedures for hospital rate increases. Others have
certificate of need programs. These require hospitals to get
approval for expansions or major purchases, such as new diagnostic
machines, that cost more than a specific amount, often $500,000 or
$1 million.
   The report did not provide state-by-state breakdowns. However,
Shortell said that among the highly regulated states with the
highest death rates were Washington, New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts.
   Dr. Myron Peterson, head of pediatric intensive care at New
England Medical Center in Boston, said Shortell's figures ``are
hard to dispute.''
   He said he believes the public does not understand the
consequences of cutbacks in hospital spending.
   ``If people want to make the choice to cut costs and have less
medical care, that's all right, but they ought to be told the
truth,'' Peterson said. ``You can't have a Cadillac for Chevy
prices. It's common sense. If you pay less, you get less.''
   Shortell, a health services researcher at Northwestern
University, published his findings in the New England Journal of
Medicine. They were based on the records of 214,839 patients in 981
hospitals in 45 states.
   Shortell and his co-author, Dr. Edward F.X. Hughes, compared the
actual death rates and the rates that would be expected based on
the patient's ages, the severity of their illnesses and other
factors.
   They found that the ratio of actual to predicted death rates in
states with the most stringent rate reviews were 6 percent to 10
percent higher than in the least tightly controlled states.
   In states with the strictest procedures for reviewing
applications for certificates of need, they found that the ratio of
actual to predicted death rates were 5 percent to 6 percent higher
than in those with more relaxed rules.
   The researchers looked at death rates for 16 medical conditions,
including kidney and heart disease, that account for about 40
percent of hospital stays for Medicare patients.
   Shortell noted that 38 states have certificate of need
procedures, although they vary in how severely they restrain
hospital spending. Some of the programs, he said, permit such low
levels of spending that ``it forces hospitals to go through more
loops and discourages innovation. Some hospitals are not even
applying to upgrade equipment. It may mean that it has some adverse
effect on patient outcomes.''
   In an interview, Shortell recommended a greater effort to
monitor hospital death rates, especially in highly regulated
states, to make sure there is no serious deterioration of patient
care.

<HEAD>Officer Who Went Home During Flooding Found Guilty Of Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES PLAINES, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police officer has been found guilty
of misconduct for leaving his post without permission to help his
family during a flood and could be be dismissed this weekend.
   The Des Plaines Board of Fire and Police Commissioners found
Clifford Launius guilty Wednesday of eight counts of misconduct but
left the question of his possible firing for a hearing Saturday.
   After the decision, defense attorney Stanley Jakala said he was
optimistic the eight-year veteran would get to keep his badge.
   ``He left his post. We have never denied that,'' Jakala said.
``When the commission considers the extenuating circumstances on
Saturday, we hope he won't be fired.''
   A dismissal has been recommended by Chief Joseph Kozenczak.
Patrick Lucansky, the chief's atttorney, said Launius is ``going to
come in and show that maybe he did these things, but really he's a
nice guy and a good cop. We'll try to show he's not.''
   The three-member board found Launius, 31, guilty on charges
including insubordination and failure to perform required duties.
   Hearings during the past six months focused on Launius' decision
to leave the police station during flooding last Aug. 14. He told
the commission he went home because he feared for his family's
safety as 9 inches of rain hit Chicago's northwest suburbs.
   However, Lucansky contended that while Launius' basement filled
with water, other officers who stayed at their posts had more than
a foot of water in their homes.
   The hearings also dealt with an unrelated accusation of
brutality made against him by a motorist Launius had stopped.
Launius was cleared, however, on the accusation of physical
assault, Lucansky said.

<HEAD>Iran Seeks To Rescue Its Ally In Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's relations with Syria may be
jeopardized by a battle here between a Damascus-backed militia and
Tehran's main Lebanese ally.
   The Shiite Moslem Amal militia, armed by Syria, defeated the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in a four-day battle in
south Lebanon earlier this month. It was a big setback for the
fundamentalist Hebollah, which aims to set up an Iranian-style
Islamic republic in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, believed to contain various Shiite factions holding
most of the 22 foreigners kidnapped in Lebanon, now faces an Amal
offensive in another stronghold _ the teeming slums of south Beirut.
   Iran, which considers Syria its chief Arab ally, ``fears another
sweeping attack by Amal in south Beirut, where Hezbollah enjoys
relative freedom,'' according to a Shiite source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Iranians sent Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a conservative cleric
close to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and Deputy Foreign Minister
Hussein Sheikholeslam to Lebanon to work out a deal with Amal.
   According to Shiite sources, after a week of bargaining, Amal
was still refusing to allow Hezbollah back into the south.
   They said the Iranian team succeeded in forming a five-man
committee to try to prevent future clashes in south Beirut and the
Bekaa Valley. It is led by Sheikholeslam and includes Amal's
leader, Lebanese Justice Minister Nabih Berri. But Jannati said on
Tuesday the committee was being ``obstructed.''
   The Shitte source said that remark indicated that Jannati
``hasn't even won a solid promise from Amal that further crackdowns
will be averted.''
   If Hezbollah is defeated in south Beirut, a predominantly Shiite
area, its zone of influence will be limited to the Bekaa Valley in
east Lebanon. That region is controlled by the Syrians who have
about 25,000 troops there under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate. Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has become
increasingly alarmed at the challenge from Hezbollah.
   Amal, with Syrian approval, moved against Hezbollah in south
Lebanon on April 4 after Iran provided the fundamentalists with
millions of dollars to fund welfare projects to win more Shiite
support.
   The kidnapping in February of a U.S. Marine officer, Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, who was serving with a United Nations observer
group, also angered Syria. Amal launched a dragnet for the
kidnappers and rounded up Hezbollah supporters it claimed were
involved in the abduction.
   But there was no sign of Higgins, whose abduction was claimed by
a group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.
   After four days of fighting this month in which at least 62
people were killed, Hezbollah lost its strongholds in the region
north of Israel's border.
   Amal's seizure of the south ``stripped Iran of one of the main
areas in Lebanon where it had free rein to spread its influence,''
the source said.
   ``Iran is convinced that Amal would not have cracked down on
Hezbollah in the south without Syrian approval,'' he added.
   In Beirut, Hezbollah is restricted to the southern slums. Syrian
President Hafez Assad sent 7,500 commandos with tanks into Beirut's
Moslem sector in February 1987 to end three years of militia
anarchy.
   One factor inhibiting an attack on the slums is the belief that
most of the missing foreigners are held there and would be in
danger if the Syrians tried to move in.
   Nine Americans are among the foreigners seized in Lebanon. The
longest held is Terry A. Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped on March
16, 1985.
   Syria is under mounting pressure from the Arab world to break
with Persian Iran. The Iranians have provided the Syrians with 1
million tons of free oil a year since 1982. But Syria, its own oil
production rising after the discovery of new fields, is becoming
less dependent on Iranian largesse.
   Embarrassed by the kidnappings, Syria has made clear that its
patience with Iran's unruly allies is wearing thin.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet pullout from Afghanistan could
trigger new regional turmoil or even a pre-emptive strike against
Pakistan's nuclear installations, says Pakistani opposition leader
Benazir Bhutto.
   There is great danger ``of Afghanistan becoming another Lebanon
with different factions holding say in different parts,'' Ms.
Bhutto, chairwoman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, said Wednesday at
a news conference.
   Pakistanis generally expect the pro-Soviet government in Kabul
to collapse after Soviet troops begin withdrawing next month, and
when this happens different resistance groups may start fighting
each other for power ``if some solution is not worked out
beforehand,'' she said.
   ``If there is a vacuum ... it will be difficult for Pakistan to
just ignore the situation,'' she said. ``On the other side, there
are Persian-speaking Afghans. Iran so far has not taken any deep
interest in Afghan internal affairs, nonetheless it may find in a
vacuum it is also tempted to exert its influence.''
   With an Afghanistan settlement, the nuclear issue ``threatens to
become the most major foreign policy issue for Pakistan,'' bringing
potential isolation and danger, she said.
   The danger comes from the threat of a cutoff of American
economic and military aid, erosion of credit with countries opposed
to nuclear proliferation and vulnerability to ``pre-emptive action
by outside countries,'' she said.
   The United States cut off aid in 1977 and 1979 because of signs
Pakistan was developing nuclear weapons. U.S. law requires denying
aid to countries making nuclear weapons.
   But the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan led to a swift
turnabout, with Washington reluctant to damage ties with a
government that has helped the Afghan guerrillas.
   While twice mentioning a potential pre-emptive strike against
Pakistan, Ms. Bhutto avoided pinpointing potential attackers. Two
countries, India and Israel, have been mentioned in occasional
speculative news reports.
   ``Rather than aggravating to a point of conflict or pre-emptive
action against Pakistan, I think one should use diplomatic skill to
go to the root of the problem to secure our security,'' Ms. Bhutto
added.
   If India were willing to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, Pakistan would also sign, and ``there would be no
problem,'' but for Pakistan to sign unilaterally is difficult
politically, she said.
   Pakistan President Mohammed Zia Ul-haq's government has often
denied Pakistan is developing nuclear weapons, but Ms. Bhutto
suggested the denials are ambiguous.
   Zia in a 1977 bloodless coup overthrew Ms. Bhutto's late father,
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and declared a martial law that
was lifted only in 1986. Bhutto was hanged in 1979 after being
convicted of ordering a political murder.
   The Peoples Party founded by Bhutto and later led by his widow
and daughter is the most secular of several political groups
emerging in the predominantly Moslem country.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Consent Decrees On All-Terrain Vehicles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement banning the sale of unsafe
three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles until they meet safety standards
and requiring warnings for operators of the four-wheeled variety
will be allowed to go into effect.
   ``No decree designed to protect consumers has ever gone this far
in meeting such a massive national consumer problem,'' U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said Wednesday after approving the
agreements with some modifications.
   The settlement between the Consumer Product Safety Commission
and five manufacturers has been criticized by consumer groups and
lawmakers as providing inadequate protection or compensation for
owners of the vehicles known as ATVS.
   The consent decree bans the sale of three-wheel ATVs unless the
manufacturers can devise performance standards that are approved by
the CPSC.
   The decrees also require warning labels on four-wheel models.
Distributors must provide training in the safe use of all types of
ATVs to owners who purchased the vehicles after Dec. 30. 1986.
   They also require the manufacturers to spend $8.5 million to
warn consumers about the hazards of ATVs and promote training.
   There are an estimated 2.4 million ATVs in use in this country,
including 1.5 million three-wheel models. They have been blamed for
1,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries requiring handling at a hospital
emergency room.
   One consent decree is with four Japanese firms and their
American divisions _ Honda Motor Co. Ltd, Yamaha Motor Co. LTD,
Suzuki Motors Co. LTD. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries LTD. The other
decree is with Polaris Industries, a U.S.-based manufacturer.
   The revised consent decree eliminates a provision that allowed
the CPSC to initiate a general recall only if it found ``new and
substantial evidence'' the vehicles were hazardous.
   It also bars the CPSC from initiating a so-called generic recall
of ATVs before Dec. 31, 1990. The original decree empowered the
agency to take such action a year after the agreement received
court approval.
   Another modification requires the distributors to require
dealers in new or renewed franchise contracts to warn customers of
the hazards, specifically to children, of ATVs and to ensure the
vehicles bear the required safety labels.
   The original decree had required the manufacturers to make their
``best efforts'' to get the dealers to implement these requirements.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at
an all-time high Thursday, while the U.S. dollar edged down in
trading against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 54.80-points
Wednesday, added a healthy 242.15 points, or 0.89 percent, to close
the day's session at 27,434.12. The closing level surpassed its
previous high of 27,246.77 reached on Tuesday.
   The dollar finished at 124.82 yen, down 0.17 yen from its close
on Wednesday.
   ``Investors see no reason to sell their shares. The second
consecutive advance on Wall Street overnight also gave a boost to
the market,'' said a stock analyst at a securities house, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   But the analyst said institutional investors _ main market
players _ largely remained on the sidelines in advance of Japan's
holiday-studded ``Golden Week.''
   Banks and financial institutions will be closed for most of
Golden Week holiday, which begins Friday and ends next Thursday,
May 5. Trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange will take place Saturday
during the regular half-day session and Monday will be a regular
business day.
   The U.S. dollar opened at 124.83 yen, down 0.16 yen from
Wednesday's close, and finished the morning session trading at
124.86 yen.
   An exchange dealer with a major commercial bank in Tokyo said
the dollar likely would trade in a narrow range in the absence of
fresh news to affect the market prior to the holiday week.

   The woman accused of killing her husband with a
cyanide-spiked painkiller tearfully told a courtroom that she
watched him collapse, never knowing that he was dying.
   ``Babe, I feel like I'm going to pass out,'' Stella Nickell,
testifying Wednesday at her U.S. District Court trial, quoted her
husband as saying before he collapsed at their home June 5, 1986.
   ``He squatted down ... shook his head,'' she said. ``He wouldn't
answer me. He stood up. ... I pulled him back toward the door ...
he put his hands on the couch to brace himself and collapsed.''
   When he didn't revive, she said, she telephoned for help.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, who is accused of killing her husband, Bruce,
and a woman with cyanide-laced Excedrin capsules, tearfully told
the jury that she never talked of murdering him and had researched
cyanide poisoning only after his death.
   Prosecutors expected to begin cross-examining Mrs. Nickell today.
   She is charged with causing two deaths by tampering and three
counts of tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce.
She's the first person in this country to be tried on charges of
causing death by tampering with over-the-counter medicine. If
convicted, she could face life in prison.
   Sue Katherine Snow, 40, of Auburn, died after swallowing a
cyanide-tainted Excedrin capsule two weeks after Nickell.
Prosecutors say Mrs. Nickell poisoned other over-the-counter pain
relievers to make her husband's death appear the work of a random
killer.
   Mrs. Nickell described her 52-year-old husband as a loving,
good-natured man with a sense of humor. She denied telling family
members her marriage was unhappy or had grown boring since she and
her husband stopped drinking alcohol in 1979.
   ``I believe that my feelings grew a lot stronger'' after the
drinking stopped, she said. ``We got along a lot better.''
   She acknowledged periodic financial stresses, including a 1983
bankruptcy filing, but denied that their money troubles threatened
the marriage or that she saw collecting on his life insurance as an
easy solution.
   Prosecutors contend she killed her husband in hopes of
collecting up to $176,000 in benefits, and forged his signature on
insurance paperwork.
   She said she signed the forms with her husband's permission
because he ``despised paperwork.'' She said she thought he had only
$25,000 in life insurance.
   Mrs. Nickell's daughter, Cindy Hamilton, testified Tuesday that
her mother had discussed several possible ways to kill Nickell.
   Mrs. Nickell, asked Wednesday if she had ever told her daughter
that she intended to poison her husband with cyanide, or that she
had attempted to kill her husband, replied, ``No.''
   Ms. Hamilton also testified her mother discussed copying the
unsolved Chicago-area poisonings in which seven people died from
cyanide-laced Tylenol, and also asked how to hire a hit man and
where she could buy heroin.
   And, Ms. Hamilton said, her mother mulled the possibility of
putting a cocaine overdose in Nickell's iced tea.
   In other testimony Wednesday, FBI specialist Carl E. Collins
said 84 fingerprints belonging to Mrs. Nickell were found on 47
pages of ``Deadly Harvest,'' a book about poisonous plants.
   Mrs. Nickell said her prints were found on the book because she
hoped to protect her granddaughter and children for whom she
babysat from any such plants around her suburban Seattle home.
   Collins, the prosecution's final witness, also said her
fingerprints were found in three encyclopedia volumes concerning
poisons.
   Mrs. Nickell said she researched cyanide only after Nickell's
death because ``I wanted to know what it was that killed my
husband.''

   Law enforcement officials have a message for
drug pushers living in public housing projects: go out of business
or get evicted.
   U.S. marshals seized apartments at city housing projects on
Wednesday as a joint federal-city force arrested the occupants on
drug trafficking charges.
   Emanuel Popolizio, chairman of the city's Housing Authority,
said the seizure ``sends out the word to drug abusers: get the hell
out of our housing projects and get the hell out of the City of New
York!''
   Tenants had complained about drug trafficking, prompting the
investigation that led to the seizures, officials said.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said the action was ``as far as I
know, the first in the nation'' using civil provisions of federal
drug laws to seize the lease of a public housing apartment.
   ``It will not be the last,'' Giuliani said at a news conference.
   However, Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, questioned the evictions.
   ``We believe seizing someone's property or property interest
because he has been accused of being a drug dealer is a serious
violation of civil liberties,'' Siegel said. ``It turns the
presumption of innocence upside down.''
   Giuliani said the apartments were seized, the occupants removed
and the locks changed under a federal civil statute that allows
seizure _ and forfeiture upon a conviction _ of property used in
the commission of drug law violations.
   He said the statute had been used previously to seize private
houses, cars, boats and planes.
   The announcement came shortly before a police sergeant was shot
to death in an apartment while searching for cocaine. Mary Lee
Warren, head of the narcotics unit in Giuliani's office, said the
shooting was not related to the eviction program.
   Marshals seized an apartment in a seven-story building on
Manhattan's Lower East Side, and the city-federal officers arrested
its lone tenant, Sandra Deanne, 28, for heroin trafficking.
   In a 20-story building in the South Bronx, Donald Johnson, 49,
was arrested for cocaine trafficking and his apartment seized.
   Both were charged with drug trafficking, conspiracy and
maintaining a location for narcotics use and distribution,
authorities said.
   According to court papers, both have previous narcotics arrests
and each faces a maximum 60-year prison sentence if convicted of
all the charges brought Wednesday.
   One of Ms. Deanne's neighbors who would not give her name, said
drug dealing in her building was so rampant she was afraid to go
out into the hall to put out the garbage unless her father was
watching.
   ``There were a lot of drugs and stuff,'' she said. ``It was a
scary thing when you have children.''
   Ms. Deanne's sister, Maria, said Ms. Deanne was the mother of a
6-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl and had been a ``loving,
caring girl until drugs destroyed her.''
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said the new tactic showed
``our intent is to raise the cost'' of drug trafficking ``to the
level where it is no longer profitable.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said at the news conference that drugs were
``the scourge of America'' and fighting narcotics has ``the highest
priority at City Hall. ... We're never going to give in.''

<HEAD>Sandinista, Contra Leaders To Resume Peace Negotiations</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lede prospects uncertain.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said that if
government and rebel negotiators bargain in good faith when talks
resume in Managua, an agreement can be reached to end the civil war.
   In a statement issued on Wednesday in Miami, Enrique Bermudez
and other rebel military commanders declared their support for the
three-day peace talks, which were to resume today in the capital of
Managua.
   But the leftist Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras, remain far apart on essential issues, largely because of
the vaguely worded peace agreement reached March 23 that they are
trying to implement.
   Rebel leader Adolfo Calero leads the Contra negotiating team and
Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the president's brother, leads
the government side. Contra leaders were to arrive in Managua today
on a flight from Costa Rica.
   Government security agents on Wednesday took over the Camino
Real Hotel, site for the talks, and told guests to find other
accommodations.
   President Ortega told reporters on Wednesday, ``If there is good
faith on both sides to achieve peace in Nicaragua a definitive
cease-fire can be reached.'' The 6{-year-old civil war has claimed
26,000 lives.
   But he complained that the Reagan administration ``continues to
support the warmongering actions of military leader Enrique
Bermudez ... We hope that peace will prevail over this policy.''
   Ortega's comments came during a ceremony inaugurating the
Benjamin Linder Memorial Park in Managua. Linder, an electrical
engineer from Portland, Ore., was killed along with six Nicaraguans
on April 28, 1987, when rebels attacked the small town of El Cua in
northern Jinotega province.
   The two sides _ Contras and Sandinistas _ have been in contact
since their first meeting in Managua two weeks ago.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco met privately with
rebel leaders in Miami this week to prepare the agenda and discuss
points of friction such as U.S. humanitarian aid to the rebels on
the Honduran side of the border.
   One stumbling block in the talks concerns the rebels' giving up
their weapons. Neither the Sapoa pact, named for the southern
border village where it was signed, nor the Central American peace
plan ratified last August by the region's five presidents, mentions
that key issue.
   The Sandinistas say both plans imply the rebels must lay down
their arms. The Contras say the agreements mean they will disarm
once Nicaragua is on the ``irreversible role to democracy.''
   ``The Contras took up arms because there isn't any democracy,''
said Carlos Huembes, president of the Democratic Coordinate, an
umbrella organization of opposition groups. ``It's ridiculous that
the Sandinista Front wants to first discuss a cease-fire. They just
want surrender.''
   In seven meetings over the past month, Sandinista and Contra
military representatives have agreed only to create seven safe
zones in Nicargua into which the rebels are to move.
   They have not worked out resupply or operating conditions within
the zones.
   Under the terms of the Sapoa accord, Contras in the zones can
receive only humanitarian aid through ``neutral organizations.''
The Sandinistas want the International Red Cross to administer
those supplies.
   Last week, President Ortega accused the United States of
violating the agreement by sending food and other supplies to
Contra fighters just across the border in Honduras.
   The Sandinistas have proposed extending to July 1 a cease-fire
that was to have ended a month earlier and want the rebels to turn
their arms over to a verification commission. The Contras offered
no counterproposal that was made public. The government has pledged
tentative measures aimed at satisfying, at least in part, rebel
demands for ``democratization.''

<HEAD>FCC Scraps Plan To Raise Phone Charges for Computer Users</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Computer users won't see a hike in telephone
bills that had been considered by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   The FCC formally scrapped the unpopular provision, which would
have added about $4.50 an hour to the cost for a computer user to
link up electronically with an information provider, more than
double the hookup price for some data bases.
   In a statement issued Wednesday, the commission said it
abandoned the idea in a vote last week because the information
services industry is in a ``uniquely complex period of transition.''
   The commission found virtually no support for its original plan
to increase the costs. Computer users said the increased costs
would drive many of them off the computer networks and crush a
fledgling industry.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications subcommittee, said in a statement the FCC's
action ``will remove a serious threat to the health of the enhanced

<HEAD>Interior Negotiating to Set Up Wild Horse Sanctuary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department wants to establish a
sanctuary in South Dakota for wild horses that have filled up
government-owned land in the West.
   Robert Burford, director of the department's Bureau of Land
Management, told a House panel Wednesday the sanctuary is an
alternative to the Reagan administration's earlier plan to auction
off thousands of horses.
   The bureau is required under a 1971 law to round up excess wild
horses on the Western range. The government estimates there now are
43,000 horses roaming wild on 35 million acres, an area that has a
capacity for only 31,000 of the animals without endangering
domesticated livestock herds.
   Burford told the House Appropriations Committee's interior
subcommittee the change was made after protests to the auction were
made by animal protection advocates.
   The bureau is now holding some 8,600 rounded up wild horses in
corrals at Bloomfield, Neb., and Lovelock, Nev., at a cost of about
$2.50 a day for each horse.

<HEAD>NRC Favors Single Administrator for Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission headed by a
single administrator instead of the current five-member system
should mean more responsibility and accountability at the top, says
the agency's chairman.
   NRC chairman Lando Zech told the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee on Wednesday that a majority of the commissioners favor
transforming the NRC into an agency headed by a single
administrator.
   ``We do feel that the commission is functioning in a very good
manner,'' Zech said. ``We simply think it could function a lot
better. We're frustrated, as you can tell. We are before you ... in
a sense recommending that our jobs be eliminated. We really do
believe that this will better serve the interests of the American
people.
   Under a bill sponsored by Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo., the NRC would be abolished and replaced by the
Nuclear Safety Agency. The new agency would be headed by a single
presidentially appointed administrator who must be confirmed by the
Senate.
   Breaux told the committee, which was chaired by Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, there is ``a crying need'' to reorganize the NRC in order
to ``rebuild the confidence of the American people.''

<HEAD>Lindstrand Hopes To Add To Hot-Air Records With Ascent Over Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hot air balloonist Per Lindstrand is hoping to
reach new heights this June with a 60,000-foot ascent over the
South Texas prairie.
   The 39-year-old Swedish engineer, who risked drowning in a
record-setting voyage across the Atlantic last year, will face the
danger of decompression as he tries to go 4,876 feet higher than
ever flown in a hot-air balloon.
   The altitude record for hot-air balloons is 55,134 feet, set in
1980 by Englishman Julian Nott in a flight from Colorado.
   Lindstrand will make the voyage in an enclosed, pressurized
aluminum gondola, navigating and maneuvering his 120-foot-high
balloon through instruments.
   The balloon, with a surface area of 35,000 square feet, would be
made of a special foil-coated fabric that will improve the
balloon's heat retention.
   The adventure, scheduled to unfold about 27 miles north of
Laredo, Texas, in early June, was outlined at a news conference
Wednesday.
   Balloonists have been unable to get higher because a shortage of
oxygen causes the burners that heat the air inside the balloons to
extinguish at the high altitude.
   Lindstrand said new technology and techniques he has developed
over the last five years should allow his balloon's burners to
continue well beyond 55,000 feet.
   ``The biggest risk is obviously high-altitude decompression,''
Lindstrand said.
   A sudden capsule decompression at 60,000 feet could cause the
craft to explode outward because of the difference in air pressure.
   Even short of an explosion, sudden decompression could cause
Lindstrand to lose consciousness within seconds and cause death
within minutes, organizers of the trip said. Lindstrand will be
wearing a pressurized suit.
   The most critical factor may be the weather, he said.
   Robert B. Brice, the project's weather expert, said that nearly
flat, calm wind conditions will be needed to make the flight
successful because the huge balloon will be extremely difficult to
control as it comes in for a landing.
   Depending on wind conditions, the organizers said the balloon
may land as far as 100 miles from where it will be launched.
   Lindstrand said the plans call for the balloon to make a ``cold
descent'' from more than 60,000 feet to about 11,000 feet when the
burners will be restarted to proceed with a landing.
   If the burners can't be restarted to further slow the descent,
Lindstrand would abandon the capsule at about 4,000 feet and
parachute to earth.
   Lindstrand last year attracted worldwide attention with a
record-breaking flight across the Atlantic from Maine to Ireland.
It was the first time anyone had made such a trip in a hot-air
balloon although three previous flights had been made in helium
baloons.
   The trans-Atlantic trip almost ended in tragedy when the balloon
descended from 27,000 feet, scraped along the Irish countryside and
then plunged into the Irish Sea.
   Lindstrand and fellow balloonist Richard Branson were forced to
jump into the water and later were rescued. Lindstrand swam for
more than two hours against strong currents before being picked up
by the British Royal Navy.
   Lindstrand's records as a hot-air balloonist are for the fastest
flight, averaging 100 miles per hour; the farthest flight of 3,075
miles; and the longest flight of 31 hours, 41 minutes.

<HEAD>Simon's Net Worth Increased During Presidential Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's income fell nearly
$9,000 in 1987, but he nonetheless reported a gain in net worth
during his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   In a detailed financial statement released Wednesday, Simon and
his wife, Jeanne, listed assets of $361,978 and liabilities of
$219,243 at the end of the year, down from assets of $369,777 and
liabilities of $230,886 in 1986.
   The reduction in financial obligations boosted their net worth
from $138,891 to $142,735 _ a gain of almost $4,000.
   Simon said the couple's income fell from $130,624 in 1986 to
$121,850 last year despite a Senate pay raise boosting his salary
from $75,100 to $87,483.
   A comparison of financial statements for 1986 and 1987 showed
royalties from the sale of books Simon has written declined by
$13,000 and his Senate expense reimbursements last year were
$10,000 lower.
   However, the declines were offset in part by an expense
reimbursement of $3,000 from Simon's presidential campaign.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's key stock market indicator closed at its
highest level yet today following the overnight advance on Wall
Street, while the U.S. dollar edged down in trading against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
54.80 points Wednesday, added a sharp 242.15 points, or 0.89
percent, to close the day at 27,434.12. Its previous high of
27,246.77 points was reached Tuesday.
   ``The stable currency exchange and the good condition on Wall
Street boosted the market,'' said Keiji Arai of Sanyo Securities.
   Fundamentals are very good in the Tokyo market, and bad news
from the outside such as the passage of the omnibus trade bill by
the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, did not affect share prices much
because of strong buying pressure, he added.
   Popular issues were steels, heavy electricals and shipbuildings.
Precision machineries, textiles, foodstuffs were higher. Papers,
real estates, trading houses and securities were also firm. Some of
the department stores and drugs lost ground.
   Volume of the first section trading was estimated at 800 million
shares, up from 750 million shares on Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the dollar ended the day at 124.82 yen, down 0.17 yen
from its close on Wednesday. It was little changed from the
124.83-yen opening level. During the day, it ranged between 124.78
yen and 124.93 yen in light trading.
   Trading was thin in the absence of fresh incentives to affect
the market, said an official of a major commercial bank in Tokyo.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
dollar moved in a narrow range prior to the Golden Week, which
starts Friday.
   Banks and financial institutes will be closed for most of the
week, which will see four holidays in seven days beginning Friday.
On Saturday, trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange will take place
during the regular half-day session, and Monday will be a regular
business day.

   Wildlife biologists blasted gas-powered
cannons to frighten birds from nesting marshes where a
175,000-gallon oil spill has killed at least 130 birds, as a
frantic cleanup continued under threat of rain.
   A Shell Oil official, meanwhile, said Wednesday that the
spillage of thick crude in coastal wetlands about 40 miles
northeast of San Francisco occurred Saturday after operators of an
oil tank violated the company's written rules. ``The unanswered
policy question is how and why the plant's practice came to deviate
so drastically from company procedures,'' plant Manager Ron
Banducci told reporters during a tour of the storage area at the
Shell refinery.
   Larry Kolb, principal engineer of the state Regional Water
Quality Control Board, called the spill during the nesting season
an ``ecological disaster'' in which damaged areas may take a year
or more to recover.
   Kolb and other officials said they fear rain and high tides will
spread the oil now largely trapped in Peyton Slough and shorelines
of Carquinez Strait to environmentally sensitive bird sanctuaries
farther north and west.
   Extra teams of the California Conservation Corps, totaling about
50 members, arrived Wednesday to help the 100 Shell workers already
involved in the cleanup of the patchy 12-mile stretch of oil.
   ``We've got a long way to go, and we're trying to get there as
fast as we can,'' Capt. Larry Broddrick of the state Fish and Game
Department said Wednesday.
   State wildlife biologists set up a dozen ``zon'' guns, propane
gas-powered cannons, to scare birds away from Peyton Slough and
marsh, where about 80,000 gallons of the oil have been trapped by
man-made booms in the water.
   By Wednesday night, about 400 oil-coated birds had been rescued
from the marsh and about 130 of them had died, according to Capt.
Dave Zawadzki of the U.S. Coast Guard. At least two dozen turtles,
marsh mice and muskrats also were found dead.
   The spill occurred when oil tank workers left the valve open to
a line designed to carry rainwater off the top of the tank into the
slough, Banducci said. The line, which passes through the tank,
ruptured and the oil escaped through it undetected, according and
Kolb.
   The refinery's procedures call for the releases of water to be
regulated by manual control.
   The wrong method was used only at tank 1256, the source of the
spill, and a twin that sits next to it, said Banducci. Rainwater
for 173 other oil storage tanks is either collected in basins and
checked before discharge or sent to a treatment plant.
   ``This was most definitely not an individual operator error,''
Banducci said, adding that a Shell safety committee is evaluating
the spill and will issue a report on how it occurred later.
   Kolb estimated the cleanup could cost Shell $4 million or more,
including $3 million in penalties.
   He said a temporary dam may have to be built at the mouth of the
slough in case persistent high clouds turned to rain. However, rain
was not expected through Friday, according to the National Weather
Service.

   As contests go, ``Monday Night Winning Line-up''
was a bust for sponsoring Beatrice Cos., a boon for about 2,400
players and a few hours' work for a few lawyers.
   The attorney for most of those winning players said Wednesday
the first checks were in the mail from the $2 million settlement
that stemmed from Beatrice's cancellation of the game two weeks
ahead of schedule.
   Chicago lawyer Lawrence Leck, who filed their class-action
lawsuit, said individual checks would range from $130 to $32,000.
   But ``Line-up'' costs may have gone well beyond $2 million.
   Player Frank Maggio, who said he'd broken the game's pattern and
scratched clear 4,018 winning entries worth more than $16 million,
reached a separate settlement with the company for an undisclosed
sum.
   The case was settled on terms that are confidential, said
Atlanta attorney Richard Schneider, who represented Maggio in the
earlier case.
   ``The decision to keep everything confidential was a mutual
one,'' said Beatrice spokeswoman Kay Carpenter from her Los Angeles
office.
   But Maggio apparently did well enough to leave his job late last
year and go into semi-retirement at age 25, a friend said.
   His lawsuit was filed against Beatrice, now known as BCI, on
Dec. 26, 1985.
   Maggio accused the Chicago-based food and home-product
conglomerate with breach of contract because it canceled the
contest Nov. 29, nearly two weeks before the Dec. 6 deadline
mentioned on the back of the game cards.
   The promotion offered prizes ranging from food coupons to a
Super Bowl trip for eight in a private jet, or cash equivalents. In
a widely distributed newspaper advertisement, Beatrice said it was
canceling the contest because it had learned the game could be
manipulated.
   That revelation came from Maggio.
   ``I told them what I had done, offered to show them how I'd done
it and told them I wanted to negotiate for less money than I had
(in winning cards) at the time,'' Maggio said at the time.
   ``I think they believed me,'' he added, ``but they kind of blew
me off.''
   Joining Maggio as a plaintiff in that lawsuit was Jim Curl, his
friend and supervisor at the job he then held with Proctor & Gamble
Inc. in Atlanta.
   Curl's wife said he was out of town Wednesday and wouldn't
discuss terms of the settlement.
   Maggio's close friends have been instructed not to speak to
reporters.
   But one friend who spoke on condition of anonymity said Maggio
had ``gone back north where he's from and is taking it easy. ...
   ``He doesn't want to be found,'' the friend said.
   ``Line-up'' required players to scratch the cards' surface to
correctly pick the winners and the number of touchdowns and field
goals in eight televised National Football League contests.
   Maggio said he broke ``Line-up'' by finding there were only 309
variations. He then made a completely scratched-off master card for
each of the 309. By scratching clear the first game on a given
card, he knew which variation he held.
   Experts said Beatrice made two basic mistakes with ``Line-up.''
   First, the company should have used a computer to generate an
infinite variety of game-card patterns.
   Secondly, the cards omitted language that would have limited
Beatrice's liability.
   ``This ranks right up there with some of the big promotional
foul-ups in recent memory,'' Richard Blashek, executive vice
president for Ventura Associates International, a New York-based
contest and sweepstakes-planning service, said Wednesday.

   Polls are pointing to a potentially close
general election race between George Bush and Michael Dukakis, with
Jesse Jackson more hindrance than help as a Democratic vice
presidential nominee.
   Voter opinions change in the course of a campaign, and the
recent round of surveys testing Bush against Dukakis, with and
without Jackson, may bear no resemblance to the outcome six months
from now, pollsters said in interviews this week.
   But the polls do establish a benchmark from which future
movement can be judged, they said. And taken in context, the polls
can highlight candidate strengths and weaknesses, providing clues
to the campaign's likely course.
   ``We're not clairvoyant. This the way it is right now. It's
April. It's not November. It's close in April,'' said ABC News poll
chief Jeff Alderman. ``If Dukakis was trailing Bush by 20 points,
we could say something now.''
   That lack of a big lead for the better-known Bush is one
important result of the recent polls.
   ``It's not too early to know that it's a close race,'' said CBS
News poll director Warren Mitofsky. ``Obviously things are going to
happen between now and November that will change this. That's what
campaigns are all about. But it's fair to conclude that there's
going to be a contest.''
   The biggest spread between the likely nominees was in a poll
conducted April 21-22 for Time magazine: Dukakis had an 11-point
lead over Bush, 50 to 39. A Gallup poll April 21-23 showed a
virtual tie, Bush 45, Dukakis 43, as did a USA Today-CNN poll April
20-21, Dukakis 45, Bush 43.
   The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points
for each of the three polls.
   History demonstrates that such early polls don't always predict
the result. In late May 1984, an ABC News-Washington Post poll put
Walter Mondale 11 points behind President Reagan among likely
voters. Immediately after the Democratic convention, Mondale, on a
crest of good publicity, pulled even with Reagan in some polls. But
he lost in November by 18 points.
   During the campaign, Mitofsky noted, Mondale came out for higher
taxes. A similar ``silly'' move could cost Bush or Dukakis just as
dearly, he said.
   Because many voters have not made firm choices thus far this
year, poll numbers are liable to ``jump around,'' partly through
differences in survey methods, said Andrew Kohut, Gallup's
president. He said that could explain the Time poll's relatively
large lead for Dukakis.
   More important, while polls ``are a pretty good indication of
how voters feel today,'' Kohut said, ``you have to keep in mind
what today represents.''
   The polls were done shortly after Dukakis' big win in New York,
and thus amid considerable positive publicity for the Massachusetts
governor, Kohut noted. In contrast, there was little news of Bush
that week. The result: a favorable bias for Dukakis.
   That may change, Alderman said, as Dukakis becomes better known
and undergoes more critical scrutiny. The polls' key message for
the moment, he said, is that Bush is not the shoo-in some analysts
thought him to be.
   ``One of the myths of the election was that the Democrats can't
win,'' Alderman said. ``The Democrats can win. I think people are
beginning to see that now.''
   There is less agreement among pollsters on surveys that suggest
vice presidential candidates. Alderman said other polls have
indicated that most voters solely consider the presidential
nominee: Even the dramatic choice of Geraldine Ferraro as
Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984 seemed neither to help
nor hurt the ticket.
   Nonetheless, the recent polls did indicate an impact if Jackson
ran as the vice presidential candidate. While the Gallup poll
showed Bush and Dukakis about even when their names alone were
given, a proposed ticket of Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., had a
10-point lead over a Dukakis-Jackson ticket, 50-40.
   The USA Today-CNN poll, asking about Bush with an unnamed
running mate against Dukakis and Jackson, had the Republicans up
49-42. The Time poll, done the same way, had the Democrats ahead
47-42, but had Dukakis farther ahead of Bush without Jackson on the
ticket.
   ``I think it's clear ... that Jackson hurts the ticket,'' said
I.A. Lewis, pollster for The Los Angeles Times. Also, because
opinions are not fully formed, the proposition of a Dukakis-Jackson
ticket right now may be drawing uncritical support from both
Dukakis and Jackson supporters, he said.
   ``What you're not measuring now is the people who like Dukakis
but not Jackson, or the people who like Jackson but not Dukakis,''
Lewis said.

<HEAD>Sri Lankans Vote For Councils Amid Thight Security</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lankans voted today for provincial
councils in an election boycotted by most opposition parties.
   More than 15,000 policemen were deployed in four provinces where
2.8 million voters were eligible to select 155 council members.
During the campaign at least three people were killed by a
guerrilla group.
   Only six of Sri Lanka's 18 political parties took part in the
election. The other parties boycotted, saying President Junius R.
Jayewardene should hold general elections before the district
councils are formed.
   Elections in three more districts are scheduled for June 2.
   Balloting was postponed indefinitely in the northern and eastern
provinces, where Tamil separatists are waging a civil war and where
most of Sri Lanka's 2.8 million Tamils live.
   Leo Perara, deputy inspector general of police, told The
Associated Press that all possible security measures had been taken
to frustrate any attempts by the outlawed Peoples Liberation Front
to disrupt the balloting.
   The front, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group, tried to
disrupt the campaign by killing at least three people in recent
weeks, police said. The front also was accused of the unsuccessful
attempt on Jayewardene's life in a grenade attack last August.
   The front opposes the accord mediated by India and signed by Sri
Lanka last July that aims to end nearly five years of guerrilla war
by the island's minority Tamils for an independent homeland. The
front contends that the accord makes too many concessions to the
Tamils.
   The accord calls for Tamils to lay down their weapons in
exchange for creation of the district councils, which are to give
people some say in local government affairs.
   The largest Tamil rebel group, the Tigers has rejected the pact,
and India has sent more than 50,000 soldiers to the island to put
down the rebellion.
   In New Delhi, Defense Minister K.C. Pant renewed India's offer
to the Tigers to resume peace talks but repeated India's demand
that the Tigers first surrender their weapons and accept the accord.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, say they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese, who are Buddhists and control
the federal government and the military.
   The four districts where elections are being held today were the
Northwestern District, the North-Central District and the Uva and
Sabaragamuwa districts in the south.
   Parties taking part in the balloting include Jayewardene's
govering United National Party and the opposition United Socialist
Alliance, an umbrella group of three smaller leftist parties and
the Sri Lanka Moslem Congress. The single largest opposition party,
the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, joined the boycott.

<HEAD>Extradition Approved on 39 Murder Counts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Argentine general who was his
nation's most wanted fugitive for three years can be extradited to
face charges in 39 killings that occurred during seven years of
military rule there, a judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen on Wednesday granted
Argentina's request for the extradition of Carlos Suarez Mason. On
Monday, a federal judge here ordered Suarez Mason to pay $21
million in damages to a lawyer who was tortured at Argentine
prisons under the general's command during the 1970s ``dirty war''
against leftists.
   Suarez Mason faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   Jensen rejected Suarez Mason's claim that the crimes for which
he was wanted in Argentina were political and therefore exempt from
extradition. The exception for political offenses does not apply to
``deaths that occurred to disarmed prisoners,'' he said.
   ``Suarez Mason has submitted no evidence to implicate any of the
homicide victims in any sort of violent or revolutionary
activity,'' Jensen said.
   ``Thus, there is absolutely nothing in the record which would
support a finding of a rational nexus between the homicides and any
uprising which may have been occurring,'' he said.
   Suarez Mason, 64, is not charged with personally committing any
of the killings, but he issued a secret 1977 order making his
office responsible for choosing the targets of raids, whose victims
were often kidnapped and killed, Jensen said.
   The former general also was responsible for the construction of
detention centers used to hold civilians, the judge said.
   Jensen refused to block extradition while the ruling is
appealed, but defense lawyers said they expected to get an
immediate stay from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. An
appeal could take as long as a year.
   ``This is merely a temporary setback,'' said J.T. Prada, one of
Suarez Mason's lawyers. He said Suarez Mason, who listened to a
Spanish translation of Wednesday's hearing on a headphone, was ``a
little bit upset; you can't blame him.''
   Jensen rejected four other murder charges sought by Argentina,
ruling that the victims could not be identified.
   Under extradition law, Suarez Mason can be tried only on charges
for which extradition is approved. The final decision on
extradition is up to Secretary of State George Shultz.
   ``Justice has been done,'' said Horacio Martinez-Baca, a former
Argentine lawyer who won the $21 million award in his civil suit.
Martinez-Baca had been held four years in Suarez Mason's prisons
and tortured.
   Two other civil suits by former Argentinians are pending against
Suarez Mason, who contends he has no money.
   Suarez Mason was Argentina's most wanted fugitive during his
three years of freedom before his arrest in January 1987 and is the
highest-ranking former military officer currently facing trial by
the civilian government. He was not covered by the amnesty granted
by the government to lower-ranking military officials.
   Suarez Mason commanded the First Army Corps and oversaw military
prisons in the Buenos Aires district from 1976 to 1979.
   He was summoned to a military tribunal after a civilian
government came to power in late 1983, but fled. He was arrested
last year in Foster City, south of San Francisco, where he was
living under an assumed name.
   Suarez Mason's lawyers offered two defenses against extradition:
that he was not responsible for his soldiers' actions; and that the
actions were ``political,'' and therefore exempt from extradition
under the U.S.-Argentina treaty, because they were in response to
alleged threats of a leftist takeover.
   Defense lawyers offered evidence of numerous attacks against
government and military installations and business leaders, before
and after the 1976 military coup.

   Small bombs exploded today in three bars in
this northern Basque city, causing substantial damage but no
injuries, police said.
   The Basque separatist organization ETA claimed responsibility.
   The first blast occurred at 5:30 a.m. in the Balanza bar in the
Bilbao neighborhood of Ocharcoaga. A second explosion 15 minutes
later heavily damaged the Amaya bar in the nearby suburb of
Basauri. A third explosion occurred about 40 minutes later in the
La Corona bar in central Bilbao, police said.
   Police defused a fourth bomb in the International bar in Bilbao.
   In a telephone call to a local travelers aid office, a man who
identified himself as a member of ETA said the group planted the
four bombs. Police said the same person called them to tell them
where the fourth bomb was located.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
numerous bombings and shootings in Basque and Spanish cities,
killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil
Guard officers.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, has been seeking independence for three provinces in
northern Spain.

   Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen
Silvia strayed from their royal schedule during a tour of
Disneyland to explore a ghost house and take an interstellar flight
of fancy.
   A quick tour of the Magic Kingdom had been scheduled for
Wednesday, and at the outset the king appeared somewhat
uncomfortable as he posed with Minnie and Mickey Mouse and other
cartoon characters.
   But after riding Disneyland's ``Pirates of the Caribbean,'' the
couple warmed to the occasion, showing an impromptu interest in
other attractions.
   ``They both had been here before, but her majesty remembered
what she called the ghost house and she wanted to see that again,''
said Disneyland spokeswoman Carolyn Long.
   So the couple took an unexpected tour through ``The Haunted
Mansion,'' which Long said is not really scary.
   ``They're the kind of ghosts you want to take home with you,''
she said.
   The king was drawn to Disneyland's ``Star Tours,'' which
simulates an imaginary ride through a universe designed by
filmmaker George Lucas.
   ``They both were laughing it, and they enjoyed it very much,''
Ms. Long said.
   The tour started with a parade down Main Street during which the
king and queen rode in a black-enameled, horse-drawn carriage.
   Neither of them spoke to the crowds or to reporters during the
visit.
   The couple arrived in Los Angeles on Monday for the last leg of
their 17-day, 15-city U.S. tour celebrating the 350th anniversary
of Swedish immigration to America.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Agrees With Defense That Goetz's Sentence Is Illegal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutor and the defense attorney in
Bernhard Goetz's attempted murder trial agree that the subway
gunman received an illegal sentence and should be given a new one.
   Gregory Waples, assistant district attorney, asked the state
Supreme Court's Appellate Division on Wednesday to send the case
back to Justice Stephen Crane for resentencing.
   Goetz, a 41-year-old self-employed electronics technician, was
sentenced Oct. 19 to six months in jail plus 4{ years' probation
for his conviction last year of third-degree criminal possession of
a weapon.
   The weapon was a .38-caliber revolver he used to shoot four
teen-agers on a subway on Dec. 22, 1984. Goetz said he shot the
black teen-agers because they were trying to rob him, but they
maintained they they were panhandling money.
   Three of the victims recovered from their wounds. The fourth was
paralyzed from the waist down and suffered brain damage.
   Goetz asked the Apellate Division to vacate the sentence and
instead give him a year in jail because a quirk in the law would
make him eligible for release in 60 days, whereas he would have to
serve at least four months of the six-month sentence imposed by
Crane.
   Waples said: ``We agree with the defendant that this split
sentence was illegal and must be vacated. We also agree that this
case should be remanded for imposition of a statutorily authorized
sentence.''
   He said that by law, the court must impose a definitive sentence
of one year or an indeterminate sentence with a specific minimum
and maximum term.
   Goetz delivered a keynote speech Sunday at the annual luncheon
of the Federation of Rifle and Pistol Clubs, at which he said Crane
``should have sentenced me to a testimonial dinner and a tickertape
parade,'' according to Waples' court papers.
   Goetz said the six-month sentence was an abuse of the judge's
discretion and would have an adverse impact on his emotional health.
   Goetz is out on bail pending appeal.

   A protest strike virtually shut down Arab east
Jerusalem and cities in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip today
despite Israeli claims that the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising
was on the wane.
   Following two infiltrations by Arab guerrillas, Prime Minister
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Wednesday that guerrillas were
trying to mount a spectacular attack on Israel because the uprising
was ``petering out.''
   Today, however, east Jerusalem streets were deserted in response
to a strike call by uprising leaders. Even fruit and vegetable
vendors, normally active during strikes, had closed.
   In the Gaza Strip, young Palestinians whose faces were masked
with checkered Arab scarves stopped cars to ensure workers did not
go to jobs in Israel, according to Arab reports.
   Wrecked cars and huge rocks blocked roadways in the West Bank
town of Bethlehem and oil was spread on some streets to discourage
drivers. Bethlehem's Manger Square, normally busy with traffic and
vendors, was nearly empty.
   An Arab reporter noted that even bakeries were shut in Nablus,
the West Bank's largest city.
   In Baghdad, senior aides of Yasser Arafat on Wednesday said the
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman traveled to the Iraqi
capital to meet with his commanders ``to discuss ways of escalating
the Palestinian uprising.''
   Only scattered clashes were reported in recent days in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where 174 Arabs and two Israelis
have been killed since anti-Israeli protests began Dec. 8.
   Protesters and Israeli soldiers clashed twice on Wednesday
evening after Moslems ended the sunrise-to-sunset fast that is kept
daily during the holy month of Ramadan, according to reports.
   Jewish settlers and Israel radio reported that Arab residents in
Hebron stood on roofs and shouted ``Slaughter the Jews!'' in a
disturbance that lasted late into the night. Soldiers used tear gas
to disperse the protesters. No injuries were reported.
   The incident began when youths stoned a group of Jewish women
walking through downtown Hebron at 11 p.m., said Miriam Levinger,
who was in the group.
   ``We were a group of about 15 women on a stroll when Arabs began
throwing stones at us,'' Mrs. Levinger said. ``The army came
immediately and fired tear gas at the Arabs who disappeared into an
alley.''
   Earlier, the army said, Arabs in the Dheishe refugee camp near
Bethlehem stoned troops who responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets.
   A military spokeswoman said seven Palestinians were taken to the
hospital, treated and released. Israel Television said some
suffered rubber bullet wounds and others fractures from beatings.
   An army report on Wednesday concluded that a 15-year-old female
Jewish settler whose death in the occupied lands raised a furor was
killed by a bullet from a careless Israeli guard, not by stones
thrown by Palestinians.
   But the report also blamed Arabs from the West Bank town of
Beita for causing the April 6 confrontation with a group of Israeli
hikers, during which two Palestinians also died.
   Both guerrilla infiltrations this week were near Mount Dov in
the Golan Heights, on Israel's northeastern border. In Tuesday's
clash, three guerrillas and two Israeli soldiers were killed in a
fierce gun battle.
   The two guerrillas killed on Wednesday planned to take hostages
to exchange them for Arab prisoners held in Israel, using U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering as a negotiator, said a military
source, citing documents found on their bodies. The source spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Truck driver Danny Dahan, 24, said the guerrillas fired at him
and threw a grenade. ``I jumped from the truck and it started to
roll down and I hid behind it. They fired at me while I crawled on
the ground,'' Dahan told Israel radio.
   Dahan ran about 1{ miles before reaching an army post, a soldier
identified only as Sgt. Sami told Israel TV.
   Hundreds of soldiers combed the rocky terrain, while two
helicopter gunships blanketed the ground with fire to prevent the
guerrillas from reaching nearby settlements, said the military
source. Three hours later, troops spotted the guerrillas in a
ravine. ``We fired, and they didn't have much choice but to die,''
1st Lt. Menny Moses told Israel TV.
   The military source said the guerrillas were members of the
pro-Syrian Palestine Liberation Front, headed by Mohammed Abbas,
who was blamed for the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise
ship in which an American was killed. In Lebanon, the pro-Syrian
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Lebanese
Communist Party both claimed responsibility.

   A woman who ran a red light was shot to death 12
minutes later by police who mistakenly believed she had fired at
them during a chaotic chase through Harlem.
   Lydia Ferraro, 33, of Fairview, N.J., died in her car about 2
a.m. Wednesday surrounded by 18 to 20 officers. Five officers fired
13 times, wounding her three times. She was dead on arrival at a
hospital, police said.
   Assistant police chief Mario Selvaggi said no weapon was found
in her car.
   He said as many as 20 police officers answered a report of shots
fired at police, but the shots were from Sgt. John O'Connor, who
tried to shoot out her tires after she refused to stop her car.
   O'Connor was suspended without pay for ``failing to be
forthright in interviews'' with investigators after the shooting,
Selvaggi said. Police later said he made ``a false statement
regarding the firing of three shots.''
   Selvaggi said O'Connor's use of the gun to try to stop the car
appeared to violate police procedure, which calls for a weapon to
be fired only when officers are endangered by a suspect.
   The incident began at 1:40 a.m. when Mrs. Ferraro ran a red
light and refused to stop for patrol car officers who used a siren,
flashing lights and loudspeakers, he said.
   Mrs. Ferraro, a former drug addict enrolled in a methadone
program, slowly moved erratically up and down streets until, at one
point, she ran up on a curb and stopped, he said.
   An officer tried to open her door but she sped off, nearly
pinning him against a wall, said police spokesman Peter O'Donnell.
   After her car rolled over the sidewalk for about 60 feet and
came off the curb, O'Connor fired three shots at her tires. Other
officers radioed that shots had been fired and called for backup,
Selvaggi said.
   He said some officers might have been under the false impression
that the shots were fired at the police officers and caused the
transmission of a message that overdramatized the danger of the
situation.
   As other radio cars began responding, Mrs. Ferraro suddenly
turned her car around and police converged on the scene, he said.
   One officer tried to pull her from the car but lost his grip and
she lunged toward the passenger side, police said. ``Somebody said
three times, `Watch out! She's reaching for it,''' Selvaggi said.
   A police sergeant and four officers opened fire, hitting her in
the cheek, the left side of her body, and her skull. She was dead
on arrival at Harlem Hospital.
   No disciplinary action was taken against the officers who opened
fire, although they will be assigned to desk duties while the
investigation continues.
   The entire episode, from the time she ran the red light to the
time she was shot, took about 12 minutes, police said.

<HEAD>Security Pacific to Close 40 to 60 Branches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security Pacific National Bank will close 40
to 60 branches or up to 10 percent of the company's total number
over the next three to six months, officials for the state's
second-largest bank announced.
   Executives with Los Angeles-based bank, who made the
announcement Wednesday, declined to say how many of the bank's
10,000 employees would lose their jobs. They said some workers
would be transferred to other branches and some vacant jobs would
be left unfilled.
   However, the average Security Pacific branch employs 14 to 15
people, meaning between 560 to 900 employees could lose their jobs,
the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   Grundhofer and Security Pacific President Robert H. Smith said
the closures were a key part of the bank's strategy to control
expenses and become more efficient.
   ``We are closing branches where we have a larger, stronger
branch nearby,'' said Jerry A. Grundhofer, head of consumer banking
for Security Pacific.
   Bank officials said most of the closings would take place in
Southern California, where most of Security Pacific's 600 branches
are located.
   Security Pacific, the state's second-largest bank behind Bank of
America, is the chief subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp., which
posted a $39.4 million loss for the fourth quarter of 1987 when it
set aside $350 million for possible future losses on Latin American
loans.

<HEAD>Plastic Cartoon Wristwatches Are Hot Items at Warhol Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Warhol's plastic wristwatches of Fred
Flintstone, Judy Jetson and Gumby reached $2,640 in a ``wild''
bidding war _ $2,590 more than the timepieces cost the late artist
in a department store, Sotheby's said.
   Kitschy collectibles were only some of the objects on sale
Wednesday during the fifth day of the 10-day auction of Warhol's
possessions. There was also serious jewelry on the block.
   American Indian art, including ``no end of turquoise jewelry''
was to be sold at today's auction, said Diana Brooks, president of
Sotheby's North America.
   So far, Warhol's collection has fetched $9,072,000, more than
twice Sotheby's high estimate of $3,951,000. Only 37 out of some
1,400 lots have not sold, she said.
   The highest bid Wednesday was $55,000 for a pair of surrealist
ear clips by artist Salvador Dali, according to Ms. Brooks. The
buyer, a private collector, was not identified.
   The ear clips, asymmetrical ruby-studded hearts with a honeycomb
center set with round diamonds, had a pre-sale estimated value of
$10,000 to $15,000.
   An 18-karat gold, garnet and diamond circular pendant, also by
Dali, brought $47,300, Ms. Brooks said. The pendant, estimated at
$7,500 to $10,000, depicted the profiles of Tristan and Isolde
separated by a chalice.
   The brightly-colored cartoon watches, made by Lewco, were
decorated with raised, full-length figures of Fred and Dino, his
pet dinosaur; Judy Jetson standing with hands on hips; and a
smiling Gumby. Warhol bought them in 1985 and 1986 at
Bloomingdale's, Ms. Brooks said.
   In their original plastic packaging, the watches bore the
original price tags of $20 and $10, she said.
   ``People were so wild to have the three plastic watches in the
sale. They sort of symbolize the sale of the whole collection _
something people will remember,'' she said.
   The pre-sale estimate was $60 to $80 for all three. But in
``wild bidding'' that came down to a telephone contest between four
people, the price climbed to $2,640, Ms. Brooks said. A private
collector, who was not identified, won the bidding.
   Bloomingdale's still sells the watches in some stores, said
Miraed Smith, a store spokeswoman.
   Another wristwatch that did well at the auction was a stainless
steel piece, dated 1948, with a photo image of Gene Autry and
signed ``always your pal Gene Autry.'' Sotheby's estimated it would
sell for $50 to $100 but it went for $1,870, Ms. Brooks said.
   Proceeds from the auction will benefit the Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts, which will award grants to cultural
institutions in the United States and abroad. Warhol died at age 58
last year.

   Japan and South Korea today said a wide-ranging
trade bill passed by the U.S. Congress would hurt world economic
growth, and they urged President Reagan to veto the measure.
   A top Hong Kong official, however, today said the British colony
``can live with'' the bill because some punitive provisions in the
original version were removed or watered down in the final version.
   Taiwan also noted that the bill was less protectionist than
other versions but added that it still requires the U.S. government
to retaliate against countries that violate bilateral trade pacts.
   ``It leaves no room for negotiation,'' said a statement from
Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade. Taiwan said its trade surplus with
the United States totaled a record $16 billion last year.
Washington placed the figure at $19 billion.
   The bill, which was approved by the U.S. Senate on Wednesday and
passed in the House on April 21, now goes to Reagan who has said he
will veto it. The measure toughens U.S. retaliation against
countries engaged in unfair trade.
   ``Japan strongly fears that if the bill is enacted in its
present form, it will have a serious impact on bilateral and
multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of
the world economy,'' Japan's chief government spokesman, Keizo
Obuchi, said today.
   The bill imposes trade sanctions against Japan's Toshiba Corp.
for its subsidiary's sale of sensitive equipment to the Soviet
Union. The sales violated rules of the Coordinating Committee for
Export Control, a Paris-based group that regulates Western
high-technology exports to communist nations.
   Joichi Aoi, president and chief executive officer of Toshiba,
which stands to lose more than $50 million this year if the bill
becomes law, also expressed strong disappointment.
   ``Toshiba Corp. was neither involved in, nor had any knowledge
of, the misconduct by Toshiba Machine Co., Ltd.,'' Aoi said in a
statement. ``Thus, we have been insisting that it would be grossly
unfair to punish Toshiba Corp.''
   Obuchi's statement said the bill's passage was ``extremely
regrettable.'' It added: ``The government of Japan strongly hopes
that such a bill will not finally be enacted.''
   The United States says its overall trade deficit for 1987 was a
record $171.2 billion, up from $156.2 billion in 1986. The largest
bilateral deficit was with Japan, a record $59.8 billion, up from
$58.6 billion in 1986.
   South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it hoped
``the U.S. administration ... will take appropriate actions in line
with its much publicized stand on the bill.''
   The statement by ministry spokesman Kim Hwang-kyung said the
bill contained provisions that ``might undermine an orderly growth
of international trade.''
   Kim also warned that the bill ``will hamper not only the
liberalization efforts of the (South Korean) government but also
the smooth growing of the Korea-U.S. economic and trade
relationship.''
   He said Korea fully understands the United States' trade deficit
problems and has been making serious efforts to open its own market.
   The bill would affect current international trade negotiations
and ``lead the world economy to a probable down-turn,'' Kim added.
   Little progress has been reported in recent U.S. negotiations
with Seoul over American access to South Korean markets. The United
States ran a trade deficit of nearly $10 billion with Korea in 1987.
   In Hong Kong, Director of Trade Michael Sze said the trade bill
is ``a much better bill than the original one and many of the
provisions which we were concerned about have either been improved
or dropped completely.
   ``So from Hong Kong's perspective I think it's a bill that we
can live with,'' Sze told government-run Radio Television Hong Kong.
   The United States ran up a $6.5 billion deficit on $14.5 billion
in trade with Hong Kong last year.
   Although U.S. officials have praised Hong Kong's duty-free
policies they want the colony to raise the value of its currency to
make Hong Kong products more expensive and less competitive in the
U.S. market.

   A man sought in armed robberies in
three states over the past two months died after shooting himself
in the head while police closed in to arrest him, authorities said.
   Jerrold Lee Esarey, 21, died after surgery Wednesday night at
St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Yakima, some 10 hours after being
cornered by police at a fast food restaurant in this college town
of 1,300 residents.
   Officers were tipped Wednesday morning that Esarey was in town,
and found him at a fast food stand, said police Sgt. John Harris.
When three officers closed in, Esarey ran behind the building and
shot himself once in the head.
   Esarey was sought in Washington for the abduction of a Burger
King worker in the April 2 robbery of $1,500 from the fast food
outlet in Aberdeen, and for a March holdup at a Puyallup Burger
King.
   Esarey also was a suspect in the robbery of a jewelry store in
which $176,000 in merchandise was taken Friday, and the April 15
abduction of a Boises, Idaho, couple and their nephew.
   None of the captives were reported harmed, authorities said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls in Thin Trading, Gold Steady in Dull Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell in thin trading on European
markets this morning. Gold prices were steady in stagnant trading.
   The dollar began falling late Wednesday after U.S. Federal
Reserve Governor Robert Heller warned of a growing risk of
inflation in the United States as many industries reach capacity
limits, dealers said.
   ``The market has been bearish on the dollar all along, and the
Heller comment was for many just the trigger to sell,'' one
Frankfurt trader said.
   Dealers were divided on what the effect on the market would be
of an agreement by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers now meeting in Vienna to
limit oil production.
   ``The dollar would fall if a strong deal emerges from Vienna, as
the United States is a major oil importer,'' said a trader in Rome.
   But another trader said the presence of Texas Railroad
Commissioner Kent Hance at the Vienna meeting indicated that an
agreement to cut oil production wouldn't be completely negative for
the U.S. economy.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 0.17 yen to a closing 124.82 yen. Later, in London, it
was slighly higher at 124.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates:
   _1.6727 West German marks, down from 1.6785
   _1.3862 Swiss francs, down from 1.3905
   _5.6790 French francs, down from 5.69625
   _1.8763 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8810
   _1,243.95 Italian lire, down from 1,246.82
   _1.2288 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2278
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.8777 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.8750.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $451.25 a troy ounce,
down from late Wednesday's bid of $452.00. At midmorning, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$452.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $451.90, up from $451.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.57 to close at a bid $453.54.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.49 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Wednesday's late bid.

   A rainstorm with winds of more than 60
mph battered northern Bangladesh, injuring more than 100 people and
leaving an estimated 15,000 people homeless, police said today.
   Police at Rangpur, 80 miles north of Dhaka, said by telephone
that the storm Wednesday destroyed at least 3,000 mud-and-straw
huts, uprooted hundreds of trees and downed electrical lines.
Thousands of acres of rice paddy were damaged, they added.
   Most of the injuries were caused by collapsing huts or flying
tree limbs and other debris, they said.
   About 20 people were reported in critical condition.
   Police said 15,000 people, most of them poor farmers, were
homeless.
   Rainstorms with high winds are common during summer months in
Bangladesh.
   In the past two weeks, storms in several areas, including the
capital of Dhaka, have claimed more than a dozen lives and injured
several hundred people.

<HEAD>Victorious Kim Says Voters Impatient With Pace of Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of South Korea's top
opposition party said today that the government lost parliamentary
elections because voters believed it was dragging its feet on
democratic reforms.
   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy, also
accused the United States of ``imprudent and inconsiderate''
statements amounting to interference in South Korean affairs and
said anti-U.S. sentiment is rising.
   Kim vowed parliamentary investigations into alleged official
fraud and corruption.
   But he also told reporters that his party would be ``sincere and
humble in our attitude to any kind of negotiations with the
government if it allows a healthy and constructive climate to
arise.''
   Kim said he did not expect any political instability here before
the 1988 Olympics open in Seoul on Sept. 17. He indicated his party
would be willing to defer some issues until after the Olympics.
   He also said his party would seek common ground with the two
other main opposition parties in pressing for greater democracy,
the release of political detainees and the revision of ``immoral
laws.''
   Kim mentioned the National Security Act, under which some
dissidents have been accused of favoring communism.
   Kim and a leader of the Reunification Democratic Party said they
would consider a proposal by former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil,
leader of the third opposition party, to coordinate activities.
   Kim Jong-pil's New Democratic Republican Party won 35 seats in
Tuesday's elections. Those seats could give a majority in the
299-seat assembly to either the government party or the combined
main opposition parties.
   The government party has 125 seats, Kim Dae-jong's party 71 and
the Reunification Democratic Party of Kim Young-sam has 59.
   The elections gave a sharp boost to Kim Dae-jung, 62, a 1971
presidential candidate who spent long periods in prison or under
house arrest and then was seen as a fading figure after finishing
third in presidential balloting last December.
   President Roh Tae-woo won in December with 36.6 percent of the
vote after Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam both insisted on running
and split the opposition vote. Six months earlier, as governing
party chairman, Roh had announced democratic reforms following
massive anti-government protests.
   Kim Dae-jung told a news conference that despite pledges of
greater democracy, Roh's administration had delayed in registering
new newspapers until after Tuesday's election, did not release all
political detainees, and seemed to be reneging on promises to allow
the election of mayors and provincial governors.
   Kim also reiterated charges of massive government fraud in
presidential and parliamentary balloting, but said voters had not
been swayed by government power and money this time.
   Kim said more than 1,000 political detainees remained in custody
and without their release, ``I don`t believe there will ever be
political stability in this country.'' He said his party never has
demanded the release of communists.
   He said he had not studied U.S. suggestions that South Korea pay
more of the cost of stationing American troops here under a defense
treaty, but said it has been ``a great political gamble for me'' to
defend the United States.
   Kim said the United States supported the Roh government for
``selfish interests,'' and had interfered in Korean politics by
describing the December elections as fair and by saying in an
official report that South Korea no longer had a human rights
question.
   ``This is an imprudent and inconsiderate position,'' Kim said.

<TEXT>
   Police and school officials can't explain
what triggered a three-month spree of car thefts now linked to 10
teen-agers who are accused of using tools made in a high school
shop class.
   ``Normally, you don't find that kind of operation in a small
town like ours,'' Metamora Police Chief Mike Walters said Wednesday.
   Walters said most of the 2,500 residents of Metamora, about 15
miles northeast of Peoria, were stunned by the allegations against
the teens, who were arrested Tuesday at rural Metamora High School.
   ``They're surprised at the number of kids involved and the
amount of property taken,'' he said.
   The students face felony charges that include vehicle burglary
and conspiracy to commit vehicle burglary, police said.
   Their names were withheld because the two girls and eight boys _
who have no previous police records _ are juveniles, ranging in age
from 15 to 17. Two of the youths face 27 counts each of burglary
and conspiracy.
   The group has been linked to 33 burglaries in Peoria and 14 in
Tazewell and Woodford counties. In addition, police said the group
is responsible for a residential theft in Tazewell County.
   Police estimated the value of the three-month crime spree
exceeds $10,000.
   ``Two individuals were making tools for their friends to gain
entry to vehicles,'' Peoria Police Capt. Lawrence Burwell said
Wednesday.
   The tools resembled the ``slim-jims'' used by police to enter
locked cars, Burwell said. The devices were used in most of the
burglaries, although some vehicles were entered using coat hangers
or by simply breaking windows, he said.
   The thieves usually took money, radar detectors and stereo
equipment, and some items later were sold to friends and relatives.
Burwell said the investigation by local police was still active.
   ``They went out at night and on weekends, driving around and
looking for something good,'' he said.
   ``It appears two of them made the tools in shop class. But there
is no link to anyone else at the school,'' Burwell said.
   Metamora Principal Martin Stromberger was concerned mostly with
the ties to his school's shop class. He cited a lack of parental
guidance for the arrests and said the school's role in the incident
was minimal.
   ``We don't have a course on burglary tools,'' Stromberger said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet-backed Afghan troops shelled
border areas and killed about 15 Pakistanis, officials in northwest
Pakistan said today.
   Also today, the leader of the Afghan guerrilla alliance met with
ambassadors of three European countries to seek recongnition of an
interim Afghan government being formed by the insurgents.
   Officials in the Khyber region of northwest Pakistan said about
15 people died and more than a dozen were injured when Afghan
shells slammed into the Pakistan side of the Torkham border post
late Wednesday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It was the third straight day of cross-border bombardments as
fighting between Afghan communist troops and the guerrillas
intensified in eastern Afghanistan.
   Reports reaching the Pakistani capital said the border post
remained closed to all traffic for the past two days because of the
shelling and increased fighting on the road to Kabul.
   Guerrilla leaders based in Peshawar, Pakistan, had warned of a
new surge of attacks in Afghanistan to coincide with the Kabul
government's April 26 and 27 celebration of the 10th anniversary of
the military coup that brought Marxists to power.
   Western observers said the guerrilla offensive also appears
aimed at boosting their control of the eastern region in
preparation for the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet
troops from Afghanistan scheduled to begin May 15.
   Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Union
signed an accord April 14 in which Islamabad pledged to stop
serving as a pipeline for military aid to the guerrillas and the
Soviets agreed to withdraw an estimated 115,000 troops.
   Guerrilla leaders refuse to discuss their arms supplies, but it
is believed they are planning to move their stockpiles of mainly
U.S. weapons from the Pakistan side of the border to the Afghan
side.
   Reports from the remote tribal agencies along the Pakistan
frontier indicate as many as 40 Pakistanis and Afghans have been
killed in retaliatory shellings by communist forces since the
guerrilla push started more than a week ago.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, chairman of the seven-party alliance, met
with the ambassadors of West Germany, Greece and Denmark to discuss
recognition by the European Economic Community of a guerrilla-led
government.
   Hekmatyar has said the administration would begin operating soon
at an undisclosed location near Kabul.
   According to a statement from the alliance headquarters, German
Ambassador Gerd Berendonck promised that no EEC money earmarked for
reconstruction would go to the Kabul government, but that
recognition of the insurgents would have to come from the
respective EEC governments.
   The insurgents control much of the Afghan countryside, with
Soviet-Afghan forces holding Kabul and the major cities.

   Goldie, a 23-pound albino trout
that drew tourists to a federal fish hatchery in Montana, has been
found dead after a four month fishnapping investigation, federal
officials said.
   Two men who told federal agents they used a net to lift the huge
trout out of a visitor display pond will face charges in federal
court in Montana, officials said.
   Goldie's disappearance around Christmas last year from the
National Fish Hatchery in Ennis prompted a multi-state search and
an offer of a $2,500 reward for the safe return of the fish.
   News stories produced tips tips that led to suspects, according
to Terry Grosz, assistant regional director for law enforcement in
the Denver office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Her abductors apparently showed Goldie off at a bar in Bozeman,
Mont., about 55 miles from Ennis, and weighed the fish at a store
in Milner, Colo., near Steamboat Springs, officials said.
   Grosz said when the abductors neared Steamboat Springs they
realized the furor the disappearance had caused, put the fish in a
plastic bag and tossed it in a pit along U.S. 40. Investigators
recently found the fish under about 6 inches of snow.
   Steamboat Springs, on Colorado's Western Slope, is several
hundred miles southeast of Ennis.

   Immigration Commissioner Alan Nelson said
today xtending the May 4 deadline for illegal aliens to apply for
amnesty ``would send a very bad signal to people below the border.''
   The Senate is considering a measure passed by the House that
would extend the deadline to Nov. 30. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
stopped attempts to bring the issue to a vote Wednesday.
   ``Extending it would send a very bad signal to people below the
border,'' Nelson said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   He said the long lines of aliens applying as the deadline nears
are the result of people leaving it until the last minute, not
because of a flaw in the program.
   Nelson estimated between 1.7 million and 1.8 million people
would apply under the program before the deadline, with the number
gaining legal status swelling to 3 million as eligible relatives
are allowed to enter the country.
   An immigration rights advocate, Darlene Kalke, accused the
commission of failing in its efforts to inform immigrants about the
program.
   ``There's a lot of confusion, a lot of fear,'' said Ms. Kalke,
also interviewed on CBS.
   If Gramm or another senator continues today to block the vote,
the soonest the Senate could move to cut off debate would be Friday.
   Gramm said there has been ``a mammoth increase in the number of
people entering the country illegally'' in the past year because
word spread that a tough new immigration law would not be enforced.
   ``If we came in now and changed the law on the very eve of it
going into effect, the net result would be to cast further doubt on
the credibility of the law and that would bring numerous people
across the border illegally,'' Gramm said.
   ``We extended the deadline for taxes, why not amnesty?'' asked
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The May 4 deadline has turned out to
be too short and too harsh. A refusal to extend it is cruel and
vindictive.''
   The House passed the extension 213-201 last week, a majority
much too small to override a threatened presidential veto.
   President Reagan signed the landmark immigration law in November
1986 and no changes have been made since then.
   The law carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal
aliens with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented
workers.
   Under the law, aliens who came to the United States illegally
but have lived here continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982, were
given one year to apply for temporary residency as the first step
toward permanent status. That 12-month deadline is May 4.
   Those who favor the extension of that deadline argue the
Immigration and Naturalization Service reacted too slowly at the
beginning of the amnesty period and did not spread the word to the
immigrant communities to apply for temporary residency.
   In addition, many illegal aliens were thought to fear appearing
at an office of the INS, the agency that also deports those here
illegally.
   The law specifically prohibits the INS amnesty employees from
sharing their records with enforcement agents.
   During House debate, the chief sponsor of the extension, Rep.
romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., said 1.2 million aliens have applied for
the general amnesty program, and 729,000 have received temporary
residency cards. Another 400,000 have applied for a spearate
agricultural amnesty program that is not affected by the extension
legislation.

<HEAD>People Offer to Adopt Toddler Found Wandering in Traffic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen people have offered to
adopt a toddler who was found wandering in traffic a month ago, but
state officials are continuing their search for his relatives.
   Despite a flood of calls to state social workers since a judge
allowed the 18-month-old boy's picture to be published last week,
investigators say they still have few hard leads.
   ``It is so sad,'' said Gwen McKenzie, a child abuse and neglect
investigator with the state's Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services. ``This isn't something that happens every
day.''
   ``If there were relatives out there, they would have called,''
she said. ``Either someone knows this boy and is not coming forward
or he is not from this area.''
   The only clue authorities have is a confusing account by a man
who says he's ``Little Kenny's'' uncle and that the boy's father
left a Skid Row bar last month bound for Washington state on a
borrowed motorcycle.
   ``He doesn't seem to know very much about the boy,'' Lakeland
police detective Miles Watson said Wednesday. ``We want to find the
father so we can verify this is not some boy who was kidnapped
somewhere else in the country.''
   HRS officials have listed the toddler with ``Child Find'' in
Tallahassee and the national registry for missing children, in case
the child was abducted in another part of the country and parents
are searching for him.
   The toddler has been in protective custody since March 25 when
he was rescued from traffic. The next day, Michael ``Smokey'' Kwil
reported his 18-month-old nephew missing from the same area.
   Kwil told Lakeland police he first saw the boy on March 23 in a
bar. The child was with Kwil's half-brother, David Skaggs, he told
police. During the night Skaggs borrowed a motorcycle and left,
Kwil said.
   Kwil has told differing stories about what happened to the boy,
but Watson said it appeared the child wandered away from Kwil's
trailer not far from where he was found in traffic.
   A misdemeanor child abuse charge has been filed against Kwil.
   If responsible relatives are not located, the courts could put
the boy for adoption in about six months. Ms. McKenzie said more
than a dozen people had already called by Wednesday offering to
adopt the little boy.

<TEXT>
   Government warplanes bombed a food
relief station in drought-stricken northern Ethiopia and killed at
least 50 people after the area fell into rebel hands, two Western
sources said.
   But the sources disputed a claim by the rebel Tigre People's
Liberation Front that the government used naplam in the April 8
attack near Wukro in Tigre province.
   The guerrilla group said 31 people, mostly children, were killed
or wounded in the bombing, which hit a kindergarten.
   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday
night, said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in
the attack, which occurred at a food distribution center run by the
Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross.
   A Red Cross representative was at Wukro the day of the attack,
but left before the attack, the sources said. They said the
warplanes stuck about 30 minutes after monthly food allotments had
been distributed to 5,000 to 8,000 peasants, and that thousands of
drought victims were milling about.
   ``That's why so many people were killed,'' said one of the
sources, who quoted eyewitnesses who said the attack on the
civilians was intentional.
   ``They flew over and looked at them and came back and hit
them,'' said the source.
   Neither of the sources could say how many bombs were dropped or
what type of aircraft were used in the attack. The Ethiopian
military normally uses Soviet-made MiG figthers.
   Wukro came under rebel control in mid-March. During the same
time, rebels operating in neighboring Eritrea, Ethiopia's
northernmost province, also scored major victories.
   Government troops retreated to the major towns in the two
provinces, but officials have said a major campaign is planned soon
against the rebel movements.
   The government pullback and the April 6 expulsion of foreign aid
workers from the north has severely crippled the effort to save
more than 3 million northern Ethiopians from starvation.
   The government said it ordered foreigners out of the north to
keep them from getting caught in the middle of the fighting.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front has been fighting the
central government in Addis Ababa for 14 years in a campaign to win
more rights for the region. In Eritrea, the seccessionist Eritrean
People's Liberation Front has been fighting for 27 years in
Africa's longest civil war.

<HEAD>Western Artist Dies At 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA MESA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Olaf Wieghorst, one of the nation's most
prominent Western artists whose work was once displayed in the
White House, has died. He was 88.
   Weighorst died Wednesday at Grossmont Hospital from respiratory
complications that could have stemmed from an old horseback riding
injury, according to his wife.
   The Danish immigrant, who would have been 89 on Saturday, gained
worldwide fame for his works. Many of his 3,000 paintings and
sculptures are on display at museums throughout the country.
   In 1985, two of his pieces _ ``The Navajo Madonna'' and ``Navajo
Man'' _ were sold for $1 million. The price was also the highest
fetched for Western art.
   ``The Navajo Madonna,'' which depicts an Indian woman on
horseback holding her baby, had sold three years earlier for
$450,000, then a record price for Western art.
   Wieghorst's work has been in the collections of three presidents
_ Dwight D. Eisenhower, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan _ and a
host of other prominent Americans, including actor John Wayne.
Eisenhower put a Wieghorst painting on a wall of the Oval Office
during his eight years in office.
   ``My greatest teacher has been the horse,'' Wieghorst said in a
1982 interview. ``I couldn't have learned what I did from some
teacher in art school ... I learned by doing; I paint what I know.''
   The son of a Danish photographer, Wieghorst signed on as a
seaman on a Danish merchant ship when he was 18. When the vessel
arrived at Hoboken, N.J., in 1919, he jumped ship, later joining
the U.S. Army cavalry and gaining his American citizenship.
   Following his discharge, Wieghorst worked as a cowboy for three
years in New Mexico and began sketching horses. He then became a
mounted police officer in New York City, where he often patrolled
Central Park. He sketched during his free time and started selling
his works.
   He retired from the police force in 1944 and moved with his
family to El Cajon, about 15 miles east of San Diego, to take up
painting full time.
   His survivors include his wife, Mae, and a son, Roy Wieghorst.

   Federal drug investigators have teamed with
Eastern Airlines officials to find out how $1 million worth of
cocaine got to National Airport hidden in the toilet holding tanks
of a jet from Miami.
   Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Mario Perez said
it is not the first time drugs have been hidden in the toilets of
planes, but it is unlikely that a normal passenger could have done
it.
   The plane, Eastern Flight 806, originated in Barranquilla,
Colombia, and landed in Miami for unloading and U.S. Customs
inspection before going on to Washington, where the drugs were
discovered early Wednesday. It's final destination was to be Kansas
City.
   ``So far we don't know where the drugs either originated or were
to be picked up,'' said DEA special agent John Wilder, but he
concurred with Perez that it appeared to be an inside job.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline was
cooperating fully with investigators, but it was too soon to
speculate how or where the drugs got on board.
   She said there have been arrests of Eastern personnel on drug
smuggling charges in the past, but not recently.
   The cocaine was discovered by a maintenance crew searching for
the source of a leak in a toilet in the forward portion of the
plane.
   Five packages of 85 percent pure cocaine the size of bricks and
wrapped in plastic were found in the tank.
   A drug-sniffing dog brought in by DEA agents and airport police
found another five packages in the rear toilet holding tanks.
   Officials said the 10 kilograms of cocaine had a street value of
more than $1 million.
   ``In this area, it was one of the larger amounts that has been
seized,'' Perez said.
   He said the plane would have been checked in Miami by U.S.
Customs officials who normally board all aircraft coming into the
United States and search for evidence of drug smuggling.
   ``I don't know if they use canines, though,'' he said.
   Ceremsak said Eastern security personnel also participate in
searches of planes from out of the country, but she would not
specify whether drug-sniffing dogs are used.
   ``We believe the persons (who were to receive it) knew that it
was there and were to go to the aircraft when it was serviced,''
said Perez.
   No arrests were made immediately.
   ``This could have been a major drug supply route and the
shipments could have gone on for awhile,'' said Wilder. ``We just
don't know how long it's been going on.''

<TEXT>
   Homosexuals seeking full recognition by the
United Methodist Church praised a statement by the denomination's
bishops ``calling AIDS a disease, not a sin,'' but say they expect
no further advances from the church's quadrennial meeting here.
   ``The delegates to the General Conference will use the language
of faith when they talk about our living and our loving, but the
odor in the air will be that of fear,'' the Rev. Morris Floyd, a
spokesman for Affirmation: United Methodists for Lesbian-Gay
Rights, said Wednesday at a news conference.
   The Methodists' 100-member Council of Bishops, in a statement
issued last week, declared that AIDS was ``a disease, not a sin''
and that God does not wage ``germ warfare on the human family.''
   But the council also repeated the church's official disapproval
of sex outside of heterosexual marriage and continued to deny
leadership roles to homosexuals in the church.
   Nearly 1,000 delegates are attending the two-week General
Conference that began Monday and runs through May 6. The United
Methodist Church, with 9.6 million members, is the second-largest
Protestant denomination in the United States. It also has members
in Europe, Africa and the Philippines.
   Language in church law that calls homosexuality ``incompatible
with Christian teaching'' and says that ``self-avowed practicing
homosexuals are not to be accepted as candidates, ordained as
ministers or appointed to serve in the United Methodist Church'' is
scheduled to be debated Monday.
   Affirmation has 31 chapters nationwide, and 32 Methodist
congregations have affirmed their openness to full participation by
homosexuals, spokeswoman Mary Gaddis said. Gaddis, a lesbian, said
she did not expect the church to grant equal status to homosexuals
during the conference.
   ``The chances are zero in the next 10 days,'' she said. ``In 10
years _ that's a possibility.''
   ``Most Methodists, like most other people, think they don't know
anyone who is lesbian, gay or bisexual,'' said Floyd. ``The only
information they have about us is based on myth and stereotype,
with little more connection to reality than the racism-inspired
image of `little black Sambo' bears to black Americans.''
   Church leaders have responded to such charges by saying that
they are on record as insisting ``that all persons are entitled to
have their human and civil rights ensured.''
   The church's Book of Discipline, published in 1984, goes on to
say, ``Homosexual persons no less than heterosexual persons are
individuals of sacred worth who need the ministry and guidance of
the church in their struggles for human fulfillment, as well as the
spiritual and emotional care of a fellowship.''
   The move to delete the restrictive language from church doctrine
has been opposed by several conservative groups, including Good
News, an unofficial caucus that represents itself as the center of
``Scriptural Christianity'' in the denomination.
   Floyd was put on involuntary leave of absence for several years
by Bishop Jack Tuell of Los Angeles after Floyd acknowledged that
he was homosexual. In 1984 Tuell agreed to appoint Floyd to his
current job as executive director of a mental health center in
Minneapolis serving lesbians and gay men.

   Diligent coverage by U.S. journalists in Panama
is crucial to combat a misinformation campaign engineered by Gen.
Manuel Noriega and his crackdown on Panama's opposition press, said
Panama's ambassador to the United States.
   ``The enemies of democracy are acutely aware that if they are to
succeed in their designs of world domination, freedom of the press
must be fought,'' Juan Bautista Sosa said in a luncheon address to
the 102nd annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association here Wednesday.
   ``As we have seen in the case of Panama, freedom of the press
has become not only the biggest obstacle to the totalitarian regime
but also its most formidable foe.''
   Earlier Wednesday, the publishers heard from Soviet spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov; the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command and
various local experts on the Asia-Pacific region.
   The ANPA, which represents 1,400 newspapers, also conducted its
annual business meeting, which included formally electing officers
and directors to its 22-member board. The three-day convention
attracted more than 2,000 people representing 90 percent of the
U.S. daily newspaper circulation.
   The United States should communicate with Noriega but ``cannot
negotiate the future of Panama,'' Sosa said after the speech.
   Representatives from the U.S. State Department are ``conversing
with Noriega, but they're not negotiating with him. While the U.S.
definitely has legitimate concerns in Panama, what we're facing is
basically a Panamanian problem and requires a Panamanian
solution,'' he said.
   With Panama's economy in shreds and Noriega still in power three
months after being indicted by the United States on drug charges,
the U.S. government has been forced to rethink its strict
conditions for his ouster.
   Michael Kozak, the State Department's deputy assistant for legal
affairs, held secret meetings with Noriega recently. Sosa said
Kozak was expected to meet again with Noriega next week.
   U.S. economic sanctions alone would not topple Noriega, but U.S.
military action against Noriega at this time would be too drastic,
Sosa said.
   ``Noriega is defeated for all practical purposes,'' Sosa said,
``and a move by the U.S. military might give him ammunition,'' by
fueling his claims that he is a national hero defending his country
against the United States.
   Sosa remains loyal to President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was
ousted by Noriega two months ago.
   Gerasimov said that greater freedom of information in the Soviet
Union has given Soviet citizens not only a better view of the
world, but an improved sense of history.
   ``We have a real information explosion in our country now,'' he
said.
   Soviet journalists are now allowed to write about issues
affecting their country such as prostitution and drug abuse, and
literary magazines that publish works by formerly dissident authors
have seen huge gains in circulation, he said.
   ``We write about (Soviet) history, where we have a very many
dark pages,'' he said.
   The climate for foreign journalists also has improved, with the
number of foreign correspondents almost doubling during the past
five years, he said.
   There are 51 American journalists in Moscow, compared with 35
Soviet correspondents in New York and Washington, said Gerasimov,
head of information for the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
   Gerasimov, who sometimes uses his dry wit to chide Americans,
made a reference to former White House spokesman Larry Speakes'
admission in a book that he falsely attributed quotes to President
Reagan.
   ``As I understand it, I will be standing right there at (White
House spokesman) Marlin Fitzwater's side'' to keep track of what
Reagan says at the upcoming Moscow summit, Gerasimov said.
   ``I am sorry for Larry Speakes, because he cannot make from the
book the money he lost from Merrill Lynch,'' where he was forced to
resign from a public relations job, Gerasimov said.
   His speech was followed by a military briefing by Adm. Ronald J.
Hays. With Gerasimov still present, the commander of the Pacific
Command and two aides outlined an increasing Soviet military
presence in the Pacific as well as U.S. military capabilities there.
   In the first talk in a general session devoted to the topic of
``Asia and the Pacific in the Year 2000,'' Victor Hao Li, the
president of the East-West Center here, said that by the next
century, East and Southeast Asia will produce about 20 percent of
the ``gross world product.'' As recently as 1960, he said, North
America produced 36 percent with East and Southeast Asia
contributing only 11 percent.
   ``We must significantly alter our world outlook and adjust our
national orientation to take into account the political, economic
and cultural forces of Asia and the Pacific,'' he said.

   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia warned Iran not to push
him too far and said he would not hesitate to use CSS-2 missiles
purchased from China to defend his country, a newspaper reported
today.
   In Tehran, meanwhile, a group that helps the families of Iranian
soldiers killed in the Persian Gulf war said a ``wave of
opposition'' was building to Saudi Arabia's ruling family.
   In an interview published in Kuwait's Al-Seyassah newspaper,
Fahd accused the Iranians of seeking to occupy the Grand Mosque of
Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine, during the annual Moslem pilgrimage,
or Haj, last year.
   The interview was clearly conducted before the Saudis severed
diplomatic relations with Iran on Tuesday. Saudi officials cited
``terrorism and subversion,'' including riots by Iranian pilgrims
in Mecca last July 31 in which 402 people, 275 of them Iranians,
were killed.
   Fahd was quoted as saying that the intermediate-range CCS-2
missiles, ``designed to shore up Saudi defense capabilities, will
be used if our country is exposed to any threat.''
   ``We hope that we will not be forced to use this defensive
capability,'' he was quoted as saying. ``But if we are obliged, we
will have no alternative.''

   Community leaders, hoping to bury the
violence that has killed scores of people in their neighborhoods,
carried a powder-blue coffin to City Hall in a symbolic protest
against gang-style bloodshed.
   The motorcade staged Wednesday by community religious leaders
and the NAACP comprised 25 vehicles, including five hearses and two
ambulances. The cars wound their way through the city's south side
to City Hall.
   Pallbearers carried the casket up the City Hall steps, and local
leaders addressed the rally.
   The procession, with police escort, stopped in front of two
gang-infested high schools, where participants got out of the cars
to chant, ``Up with hope, down with dope.''
   At one south side intersection, in the heart of a neighborhood
notorious for its gang activity, police arrested two men who came
out of their home, apparently coincidentally, armed with a shotgun.
   The motorcade also featured a simulated drive-by shooting
patterned after the method favored by gang members.
   ``We conducted a drive-by _ but we did not use bullets of lead,
we used bullets of faith and bullets of prayer,'' said Raymond L.
Johnson Jr., president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Last year, 387 people died in gang-related violence in Los
Angeles County. So far this year, more than 80 people have been
killed by gang violence.
   Also Wednesday, in an incident that police said wasn't
gang-related, two elderly women sitting at a bus stop in an
affluent neighborhood near Beverly Hills were shot with a pellet
gun by laughing assailants in a passing car.
   One woman was hit in the wrist, the other in the leg, but
neither was wounded seriously by the apparently random attack,
hospital officials said.

   Police slapped $50 parking tickets on 14
cars parked illegally at the Colorado State Fairgrounds by people
who were picking up government surplus food.
   ``I know this doesn't sound like a big deal, but they gave away
cheese and other commodities to people who don't have any finances,
and here's this cop giving them a $50 ticket,'' said John Duvall,
78, a retired electrical engineer who was among those ticketed
Wednesday.
   The violators were part of a large group of people who parked
their cars in an area designated as parking for the handicapped.
   ``Somebody complained at the station, and I was sent to clear up
the problem,'' said traffic officer Brian Carter, who issued 14
tickets.
   DuVall said many were stunned when they returned to their cars
and found the tickets. ``This lady was shaking and holding her
ticket,'' he said.
   He said he parked in the same area the last time there was a
food giveaway and was not ticketed. The violators were scheduled to
appear in Municipal Court in 10 days.

   It was fairy-tale night for real at the Royal
Ballet when the leading ballerina in ``Swan Lake'' was hurt during
her performance, danced on in pain, then had to be replaced by a
dancer who didn't know the role.
   ``Oh, I loved it _ they were shouting at me from the wings and
miming what I had to do, but I couldn't dance and watch them as
well so I just danced,'' the substitute, 20-year-old Viviana
Durante, said after a sensational performance Wednesday night.
   ``It was a bit of a surprise to find a different ballerina in my
arms in the middle of the third act,'' said Jay Jolley of Payson,
Utah, who was dancing the lead male role of Prince Siegfried in the
classical Russian ballet set to music by Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky.
   ``Let's just say the fourth act was very vocal _ there was more
talking than dancing going on, but Viviana was very cool, very
together,'' he added.
   There were gasps from those in the audience who could see it
when the crisis began at the Royal Opera House.
   Maria Almeida, in the dual role of Odette-Odile, danced tip-toe
into the scenery on her left as she was going offstage after being
transformed back into a swan at the end of the second act.
   She fell against a sharp-edged step and crashed to the floor,
but rose quickly and appeared to be unhurt as she disappeared into
the wings.
   Miss Almeida began the third act but was replaced by Miss
Durante, who stepped into the role just as she had to do the famous
32 fouette turns _ a grueling series in which the dancer spins on
one leg while whipping the other around her body.
   Miss Durante received bravos and it was clear at that point that
not everyone realizedthere had been a substitution.
   The management then told all.
   Before the curtain went up for the fourth act, Anthony Dowell,
the company's artistic director, told the audience that Miss
Almeida had been dancing in severe pain and was unable to complete
the third act.
   ``There was no understudy in the house and we have been ringing
all the ballerinas in town who know the role. But this is one of
those nights when only their answering machines are answering,'' he
said.
   There were cheers when Dowell announced that Italian-born Miss
Durante, who had danced as a peasant girl in the first act and as a
cygnet in the second, had frantically tried to learn the leading
role ``in about five minutes.''
   ``It has been one of those all-too-real Broadway show-business
nights,'' Dowell said. The audience thought it was terrific stuff
and cheered.
   Miss Durante received a standing ovation at the end and was
showered with the daffodils and narcissi that fans had brought for
Miss Almeida.
   The Angola-born Miss Almeida, 24, is widely admired. She was
promoted from soloist to principal dancer in September after six
years with the Royal Ballet.
   Dowell said the extent of her injuries would not be known until
after an X-ray today: ``I just don't know how she danced so well in
such pain... And then to have someone else jump up and save the day
_ that's theater.''

<TEXT>
   President Najib vowed today that
anti-communist rebels would never take over the Afghan government
and that Soviet military advisers would remain in Afghanistan
indefinitely.
   Najib said negotiations with U.S.-backed rebel forces in
Pakistan were continuing, but he said the alliance of seven rebel
groups has taken an ``illogical, rigid stand'' in negotiations on a
coalition government.
   Najib, who spoke at a news conference for foreign journalists,
said the Afghan government was confident it could stave off the
insurgents after Soviet troops withdraw if ``outside interference''
ceases, a reference to U.S. aid to the rebels.
   ``The military cooperation of the Soviet Union with Afghanistan
began 23 years prior to the April revolution,'' Najib said,
referring to the Soviet-inspired coup 10 years ago that installed a
Marxist government.
   He said Soviet military assistance would not stop after the
pullout of Kremlin troops, scheduled to begin on May 15 according
to an accord signed in Geneva this month.
   ``It is not our position to stop cooperating with the Soviet
Union, especially when the situation is not settled yet,'' he said.
   He declined to say how many Soviet military advisers would
remain here after the withdrawal, and he said assistance from other
friendly nations in Eastern Europe also was expected.
   Najib, responding to a question, also said he would not consider
leaving Afghanistan if the rebel forces take over.
   ``We shall not allow such a thing, that the coalition government
come under the influence of these forces hostile to the policy of
national reconciliation proclaimed in Afghanistan,'' he said.
   National reconciliation is Najib's proposal for drawing in rebel
leaders with his Marxist Peoples Democratic Party in hopes of
ending the civil war.
   Pakistan-based rebel groups have rejected the offers and vowed
to continue their fight to oust the Moscow-backed government.
   In an apparent bid to put together a leadership acceptable to
the Afghan people when Soviet troops leave, Najib said he offfered
a role in the new government to former King Zahr Shah. He said the
monarch, now living in Italy, has a responsibility to help his
nation.
   Najib, who has been head of Kabul's government since May 1986,
did not specify what position the king could fill if he returned to
afghanistan.
   Najib also confirmed his predecessor, Babrak Karmal, is in the
Soviet Union, where he is under medical care.
   The estimated 115,000 Soviet troops now in Afghanistan to
bolster Najib's army are expected to complete the withdrawal by the
end of the year. Soviet soldiers first entered the war in December
1979.

   A fire described as the city's
biggest since World War II swept through a crowded shantytown near
an oil storage area today and destroyed more than 1,000 homes, the
fire chief said.
   At least four people were reported injured in the blaze, which
spread thick black smoke over large sections of the capital. No
deaths were reported.
   The government-run Philippines News Agency said an estimated
3,000 families were left homeless.
   Firefighters concentrated on preventing the flames from reaching
the oil tanks rather than on saving houses, and angry residents
responded by pelting the trucks with stones. They piled their
belongings in the street and began fighting the blaze themselves
with buckets of water.
   The flames spread to within 24 feet of the state-owned petroleum
company compound, said Col. Oscar Pascual, deputy fire chief. Fire
Chief Brig. Gen. Ernesto Madriaga said a shift in the winds
prevented the fire from reaching it.
   ``During the early stage, fire threatened the depot because
there was a strong wind blowing in that direction,'' he said.
``However, wind direction changed and the fire near the depot was
placed under control.''
   Madriaga estimated that more than 1,000 dwellings, mostly
squatter shanties, were razed before the fire was brought under
control after 4{ hours. The cause of the blaze had not been
determined.
   Hundreds of people huddled around the mounds of personal
belongings as scattered fires continued to burn into the night.
   There was no immediate estimate of damage. But Madriaga said the
blaze was ``possibly the biggest in Manila since World War II.''
   He said flames destroyed a candy warehouse and virtually every
building in a 25-acre area along the Pasig River, which runs
through the heart of Manila.
   Oil companies such as Shell, Caltex and the state-run Philippine
National Oil Co. maintain storage tanks in the area. The
presidential palace is about 1{ miles away on the other side of the
river.
   Firemen said they were unable to move trucks into the crowded
shantytown alleys and concentrated their efforts on keeping the
fire from the oil tanks.
   Troops armed with M-16 rifles were sent to the depot after the
residents began throwing stones at the fire trucks.
   Madriaga said the injured included three civilians and a fireman
who was struck by a water hose.
   Antonio Santos, operations manager of the national oil company,
said the squatter area was ``too congested for even the best
firefighters to have been able to battle the flames very well.''
   Shanty homes in the Philippines are normally made of wood,
cardboard and other flammable materials and are packed side-by-side.
   Mary Bayani, 27, whose home was destroyed, said she was
attending a Bible study class about 3 p.m. (3 a.m. EDT) when she
heard children shouting ``Fire! Fire!''
   She said the smoke seemed ``far away, but we started just the
same bringing our things out.''
   ``I saved our clothes and some kitchen utensils,'' she said.
``But we have no rice and no money.''
   Mrs. Bayani said her husband, Rogelio, worked in the burned-out
candy warehouse and will probably lose his job.
   ``We will stay here during the night,'' she said. ``But I don't
know what we will do tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Price of Imported Goods Rose 1.2 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of imported goods, one of the main
inflationary threats facing the U.S. economy, rose 1.2 percent in
the first three months of the year, a slight improvement from the
end of last year, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department said the first quarter increase followed a
1.6 percent rise in import prices in the last three months of 1987
and credited the slowdown to continued declines in energy costs and
a more stable dollar.
   The price of oil and other imported energy products fell 8
percent during the first quarter. Without this decline, overall
import prices would have risen by 2.3 percent, almost twice as fast
as the actual overall increase.
   At the same time, the cost of American products being sold
overseas rose by 1.4 percent during the first quarter, a drop from
a 2 percent price increase in the final three months of 1987. This
change was credited to a big slowdown in the cost of exported food
products, which rose only 0.6 percent in the first quarter after
shooting up by 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter.
   American grain prices rose 3.1 percent following a 14.2 percent
jump in the fourth quarter as a drop in wheat prices helped to
offset continued increases in rice and corn prices.
   The price of American meat products rose 5.1 percent following
six months of declines while the index for fruits and vegetables
fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.
   On the import side, foreign cars and machinery, which account
for nearly one-half of all U.S. imports, rose 1.7 percent in the
first quarter after increasing 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
   During the first quarter, the dollar declined in value against
other currencies by 1.4 percent. This was a substantial slowdown
from a 5.8 percent plunge in the dollar's value during the fourth
quarter. It reflected the massive buying of dollars on foreign
currency markets which the United States and other countries have
been doing this year to brake the greenback's fall.
   Overall consumer prices rose 4.4 percent last year, up from a
1.1 percent rise in 1986. A turnaround in the cost of imported
energy and higher import prices generally were blamed for much of
the worsening in inflation last year.
   This year many economists are looking for a further rise in
consumer inflation of between 4 percent and 5 percent as the weaker
dollar continues to push up the cost of imports.
   The Reagan administration, led by Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III, launched an effort in September 1985 to drive the value
of the dollar lower in an effort to shrink the country's huge
foreign trade deficits. In February 1987, the major industrial
countries switched course and started a coordinated effort to keep
the dollar from falling further.
   However, that effort failed last year as market forces continued
to batter the dollar on the assumption that continued high monthly
trade deficits pointed up a need for a still-lower dollar to reduce
Americans' appetite for imports.

   A Navy ship was towing the stricken USS
Bonefish to port today after salvage crews found the bodies of
three crewmen aboard the submarine, apparently killed when
explosions and fire filled the vessel with toxic smoke and gases.
   The bodies were found Wednesday aboard the 30-year-old,
diesel-electric sub, the Navy's Atlantic Fleet Command said. The
Navy refused to say when the bodies would be returned to grieving
relatives ashore.
   Salvors from the USS Petrel and USS Hoist cautiously vented
toxic fumes from the fire before the salvage crew could enter and
the Hoist take the crippled submarine in tow.
   Chief Petty Officer Joseph C. Mowery said today that the
submarine was expected to arrive in Charleston, South Carolina, in
two to four days, depending on the weather.
   Charleston is the Bonefish's home port and 87 of the sub's
surviving 89 crew members have been taken there.
   The Navy refused to say if the bodies of Lt. Ray Everts, 30, of
Naoma, W.Va., Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr., 39,
of Willis, Texas, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren,
21, of Pisgah Forest, N.C., were removed from the sub.
   The Bonefish was forced to the surface Sunday about 160 miles
off the Florida coast after an explosion rocked the 219-foot
vessel's forward battery compartment.
   Navy officials have said the three were last seen in the
vessel's control room and might have died while saving their
shipmates.
   ``That was his job _ getting people out,'' said Bordelon's
brother David, in Willis, Texas. ``That was his responsibility, and
Bobby is the kind who would help anybody.''
   Lindgren's mother, Joyce, said her son ``was a super boy, a
super son, and became a super man when he went into the Navy. He
dearly loved it. And I've never heard anyone describe their job as
gloriously as Marshall did.''
   Only two of the 22 crewmen suffering smoke inhalation from the
accident remain hospitalized in the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville,
Fla. Both are in satisfactory condition and are expected to be in
the hospital a week.
   The 30-year-old Bonefish is one of the Navy's few remaining
diesel-electric subs, driven by diesel engines while on the surface
and by battery-powered electric motors while submerged.
   Recharging those batteries generates hydrogen gas, which can
explode if allowed to accumulate.
   The Bonefish's initial explosion occurred while the sub was at
periscope depth. The sub was able to surface and Cmdr. John Wilson,
42, the ship's captain, ordered the crew evacuated in the face of
heavy smoke and toxic fumes.
   They were taken off the sub by helicopter and whaleboat from the
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and the frigate USS Carr, both of
which were participating in exercises with the sub.
   The last battery explosion aboard a Navy diesel-electric sub was
in 1949 off the Norwegian coast, when the USS Cochino went down
after a similar series of explosions during a gale.
   The crew was successfully evacuated to the submarine USS Tusk,
but seven Tusk crew members died in the rescue.

<HEAD>Louisiana Legislative Committee Backs Repeal Of AIDS Testing Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A Louisiana House committee voted unanimously to repeal a law
that requires people getting married to be tested for exposure to
the AIDS virus a day after an Illinois legislative committee
approved a bill to repeal a similar law.
   The Louisiana law has chased hundreds of young couples to
neighboring Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas to be married, said
Rep. Alphonse Jackson, chairman of the House Committee on Health
and Welfare. He said some physicians and laboratories charged as
much as $200 for the tests.
   The day before the vote Wednesday in Baton Rouge, the Illinois
House Human Services Committee voted to repeal that state's law.
Both laws went into effect Jan. 1.
   Although the Illinois repeal faces continued opposition from
legislators who say it is premature, Louisiana committee members
predicted easy passage. The Louisiana repeal is backed by
physicians, hospitals and even the author of the testing law.
   Committee members said they had no idea how many positive cases
were discovered as a result of the tests because Louisiana's
confidentiality laws prohibit disclosure of such information.
   In Illinois, repeal supporters said that premarital testing
uncovered one case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome for every
4,000 people tested.
   Dr. Louise McFarland, a physician with the Louisiana Department
of Health and Hospitals, acknowledged that the test is not
foolproof.
   ``A negative means they've not had a chance to build up
antibodies but it doesn't mean the virus is not there,'' she said.
   A direct test for the virus, which attacks the body's immune
system and leaves it susceptible to fatal cancers and viruses, is
being developed but will be expensive, McFarland said.
   McFarland also said that those getting married aren't in the
high-risk groups, which include homosexual men and drug abusers who
share needles.

   Three Republican House members asked
colleagues today to oppose a package of sanctions against South
Africa which they say amounts to a ``scorched earth'' policy that
will hurt blacks.
   The three _ Reps. Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, Dan Burton of
Indiana and William Broomfield of Michigan _ wrote a letter to
members of the Democratic-controlled House Foreign Affairs
Committee as the panel prepared to vote on the sanctions package.
   The package would impose tough sanctions on South Africa such as
prohibitions on all U.S. investment, on all imports from that
country, excluding strategic minerals, and on U.S. exports to the
nation, except donations to relieve human suffering.
   Supporters of the bill, including Rep. William Gray, D-Penn.,
and Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., say the sanctions are needed because the
limited restrictions imposed on South Africa in 1986 have failed to
reform the apartheid system of segregation.
   But the GOP members say the sanctions have backfired in some
cases, and tightening them will worsen the economic situation for
blacks.
   ``Apartheid is breaking down despite, not because of,
sanctions,'' they said in a three-page letter. They claim the
sanctions have hurt U.S. interests and stricter bans will throw
black South Africans out of work.
   They cite a study by the New Jersey Division of Investment,
which said New Jersey lost $365 million in pension funds because of
divestment measures.
   The GOP letter claimed that a study by COSATU, the South African
black labor union, estimated that 2 million more South Africans
would be out of work by the year 2000 if sanctions are increased.
   The three Republicans urged their colleagues to support their
substitute measure which does not repeal the 1986 sanctions, but
attempts to target U.S. assistance to blacks.
   Among other things, the substitute would provide housing loan
guarantees to blacks and encourage U.S. businesses to help the
black business sector.
   They said the substitute would lead to positive developments in
the black community, in contrast to the Dellums-Wolpe legislation,
which ``takes a total `scorched earth' approach.''

   Jesse Jackson won Vermont's presidential
caucuses, according to official Democratic Party results released
today.
   Jackson edged Michael Dukakis by winning 596 of the state
convention delegates elected at local caucuses last week. Dukakis
won 582 delegates, while 120 were elected uncommitted. Albert Gore
won four delegates.
   The percentages were 46 percent for Jackson, 45 percent for
Dukakis and 9 percent uncommitted.
   Craig Fuller, executive director of the state Democratic Party,
said the official tabulation had been slowed by mistakes found in
some community caucuses. He said, for example, that in several
communities, more delegates were elected than had been allocated to
that town.
   The delegates elected April 19 will attend the state Democratic
Party convention next month at which time 14 of the state's 19
delegates to the national convention will be elected. The remaining
five spots belong to Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a Dukakis supporter, and
four party officials.
   ``In Vermont, more than in any other state, white people did not
hesitate to vote for Jesse Jackson,'' Liz Blum, the Jackson state
coordinator, said today. ``It shows how independent and thoughtful
Vermonters are.''
   Dukakis had won Vermont's non-binding presidential primary on
March 1, receiving 56 percent of the vote to Jackson's 26 percent.
Blum said she feels Jackson did better in the caucuses because ``it
takes more of an effort to go to a caucus.''
   William Wasserman, the Dukakis coordinator, said Jackson
out-organized the Dukakis campaign. ``They organized in the
smallest of communities, as well as the larger ones. That showed
real persistence, real dedication to detail.''
   Blum said the Jackson campaign would try to use its clout at the
state convention to elect at least half of the delegates to the
national convention and to pass resolutions supporting the Equal
Rights Amendment and calling for reducing the military budget by
$20 million and redirecting the money to a comprehensive
cradle-to-grave health care system.

<HEAD>Southern Command Raises Alert Status for American Servicemen in
Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Southern Command told American
servicemen and their dependents in Panama today to reduce the
amount of time they spend in public areas, citing the probability
of new demonstrations against strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega.
   The command also ordered Defense Department schools on the
Pacific end of the Panama Canal to close at noon EDT, said Capt.
Nancy LaLuntas, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
   The Pentagon said the Southern Command had raised the so-called
Personnel Movement Limitation to a ``Bravo'' status, effective at
10 a.m. EDT.
   Under the Bravo alert status, American servicemen and dependents
are instructed to ``decrease visibility'' because ``some civil
disturbance activity is probable.''
   According to the military order, all personnel ``should reduce
the amount of time spent in public areas of Panama.''
   ``If you do not live on a defense site or military area of
coordination, stay around your residence unless traveling to and
from work or conducting personal business in a non-affected area,''
the order said.
   The moves were ordered strictly ``on a precautionary basis based
on the probability of some civil disturbances this afternoon,'' she
added.
   Leaders of the opposition to Noriega's rule have planned a
number of street demonstrations in and around Panama City today.
Panama's attorney general, Carlos Villalaz, countered Wednesday by
announcing that leaders of the Civic Crusude opposition would be
arrested on subversion charges.
   The U.S. Southern Command is responsible for overseeing all
American military personnel in Central and South America, and is
headquartered in Panama. There are more than 10,000 U.S. servicemen
in Panama.

   The Matsukaze was en route to Tacome with a load of lubricating
oil, cotton oil, corn oil and tallow when it went aground around 4

   There were no injuries reported. Koontz said tanks holding
ballast water were punctured, and some water spilled out.
   The cause of the grounding was not immediately known. The Coast

the vessel, said Coast Guard spokesman Roy Compton.
   A Coast Guard helicopter flew over the 490-foot vessel at 6:15
a.m. today, and no pollution was detected, Compton said.

   A Politburo member appeared today at the
huge Lenin steel mills, where management declared a strike by
thousands of workers illegal and reportedly threatened to call in
riot police to end the three-day walkout.
   Organizers said 16,000 workers, or half the work force, were on
strike at the mills outside the southern city of Krakow to demand
higher pay. It is Poland's largest work stoppage since martial law
stifled the independent Solidarity labor union 6{ years ago.
   Negotiations at the Lenin works broke off early today.
   Alfred Miodowicz, a member of Poland's Communist Party Politburo
and the head of the All-Poland Trade Union Alliance, was at the
mill and said another government official, Deputy Prime Minister
Zbigniew Szalajda, also was expected. Szalajda is the government's
industrial policy chief.
   The personal involvement of two senior officials indicated a
high level of official concern about the strike, which comes only a
few days before official May Day celebrations, an annual time of
protest for government opponents.
   Miodowicz, who began his career as a steel worker at the Lenin
plant in Nowa Huta outside Krakow, is the head of the union
alliance created in 1982 to take Solidarity's place.
   Asked by a Western reporter about the possibility of using force
to break the strike, Miodowicz said, ``I don't think that will be
necessary.''
   In other developments, about 100 people staged a brief rally in
Krakow in support of the strike. Solidarity activists in the
southeastern Polish city of Stalowa Wola reaffirmed their call for
a strike Friday at an 18,000-worker heavy machinery plant there.
   The government has raised prices 42 percent so far this year as
part of a program to make the economy more market-oriented, and
there is widespread discontent that wages are lagging behind
inflation.
   The 16-member strike committee was formally notified by a
prosecutor today that their strike was illegal, and company foremen
were distributing forms in which each worker was asked to declare
in writing whether or not he was on strike.
   But the committee said it would ignore the prosecutor's letter
and told workers not to sign the forms, said Zygmunt Lenyk, an
opposition activist in Krakow.
   Amid signs of increasing tension at the plant, negotiations with
the strike committee that began at midnight lasted just 15 minutes,
and one committee member said they were told by a director that if
a political solution was not found soon, ``the ZOM0 (special riot
police) will take over.''
   On Wednesday, the strikers rejected a government offer that
nearly met their demand for a 50 percent pay increase.
   Management later told strike leaders that if no agreement was
reached, it ``would not be responsible for the security of the
strikers,'' Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said today in Warsaw.
   Stanislaw Handzlik, a strike committee member, said by telephone
that more than 12,000 strikers were at the plant this morning.
Organizers said workers were rotating inside the plant, staying two
shifts then going home for one.
   Outwardly, the plant appeared calm, with no banners and little
activity.
   The government was to enter talks today with city transit
workers in Lodz, Torun and Grudziadz, who are seeking higher wages.
   On Monday, transit workers in the northwestern city of Bydgoszcz
staged an 11-hour strike and won a 60 percent raise. A day later,
the strike began at the Lenin mills. Organizers said it was
spontaneous.
   The labor troubles are Poland's most serious since the yearlong
heyday of the now-outlawed Solidarity trade union movement, which
ended with the government's December 1981 crackdown. Strikes of
occupation were then violently broken up by riot police and
hundreds of union supporters interned.
   Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa, in a statement issued from his
home in the northern port of Gdansk on Wednesday, urged Poles to
``put pressure on the authorities'' and called for the restoration
of Solidarity's legal status.
   The strikers at the steel mills have demanded the government
double the current $15 compensation for the price increases for
industrial workers, retirees, teachers and health workers.
   For themselves, they demanded an immediate 50 percent raise in
their average $105 monthly pay. Kuron, the Solidarity adviser, said
they turned down a management offer of a $50 raise to be phased in
by October.
   Strikes over higher prices have a long tradition in postwar
Poland and caused government shakeups in 1956, 1970 and 1980.

   Truckers are continuing to protest the
special 55 mph speed limit on Indiana interstates for trucks over
13 tons, state police said today.
   Trucks are creeping along Interstate 70 in convoys from the Ohio
line to the Illinois border, troopers said. Three westbound convoys
involving at least 120 trucks passed through the Indianapolis area
about 10 p.m. Wednesday.
   A Pennyslvania man was arrested during a 67-truck convoy Tuesday
night following a scuffle with a trooper.
   No disturbances were reported Wednesday night, a dispatcher at
the Indianapolis post said. Other dispatchers said some trucks were
using both lanes and blocking traffic. The convoys at times were
moving below the state's minimum speed limit of 40 mph.
   A new state law that went into effect April 1 covers only
heavier trucks. Autos and light trucks may drive 65 mph on rural
interstates.

<TEXT>
   The University of Georgia has recruited 15
new black teachers, three times the goal set last year by the
university's president.
   The new faculty represent the university's commitment ``to
action _ not just words _ in creating an environment that welcomes
minorities to this campus,'' President Charles Knapp said Wednesday
in a statement.
   This year, there are 29 blacks among the 2,000 faculty on campus.
   Even though the numbers of black faculty are still relatively
small, the new hirings may give the university the highest number
of black faculty at any research university in the South, according
to Louise McBee, acting vice president for academic affairs.
   The additional black faculty members also should help the
university attract more members of minority groups, Knapp said.
About 5 percent of the university's full-time student body of
almost 25,000 is black.
   All but one of the new faculty are in tenure-track positions; 13
will enter at the assistant professor level. They will begin work
in the fall.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate today approved a ban on federal
money for programs that distribute clean needles to drug addicts
unless the surgeon general finds that such methods will curb the
spread of AIDS.
   The amendment to an AIDS research and information spending bill
was a compromise reached after the Senate rejected two outright
bans pushed by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. The conditional ban was
approved on a voice vote after a 70-27 vote to modify the outright
ban.
   The AIDS bill, sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is attracting a plethora of controversial
amendments ranging from the clean-needle ban to restrictions on
federally funded AIDS education materials.
   Public health authorities in some places are trying to stem the
rapid spread of AIDS among drug addicts by allowing them to turn in
dirty needles which may be contaminated and receive clean ones.
   ``It's far too early to make a final judgment on the
needle-exchange program. The results are mixed. There hasn't been
adequate research,'' said Kennedy, sponsor of the compromise
amendment.
   The amendment says money under the bill could not go for clean
needles for individuals for the purpose of using illegal drugs,
unless the surgeon general finds such programs help stop either
drug addiction or the spread of AIDS.
   After the vote Helms condemned the compromise, saying Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop has already said needle-exchange programs
may be a good idea. ``It's just a matter of time'' before federal
money is spent on them, Helms said.
   Earlier today, the Senate voted 59-37 against a broader Helms
ban _ the second time in two days it had rejected similar versions
of his amendment. Lawmakers said both versions could have deprived
drug addicts with AIDS of intravenous feeding, experimental drugs
and other treatment.
   The Kennedy-Hatch bill authorizes $665 million for state and
federal information and education campaigns, home health care for
AIDS patients, new hiring at the National Institutes of Health, and
special projects targeted to drug abusers and minorities. It also
authorizes open-ended research spending, expected to bring the
total to about $1 billion.
   AIDS testing, confidentiality and discrimination are addressed
in a separate bill that has not reached the House or Senate floor.
But they were among the issues senators planned to raise with their
amendments.
   One of the most controversial proposals was a Helms attempt to
renew a ban on federal money for education or information materials
that promote, encourage or condone homosexual activities. A similar
Helms provision adopted last year on a 94-2 vote is due to expire
Sept. 30.
   Denouncing an educational AIDS videotape aimed at gay men, Helms
said Wednesday, ``I will strongly oppose the use of taxpayers'
money to advocate or condone sexual activity outside of monogamous
marriage.''
   At least one senator who supported the Helms amendment last year
said he was leading a crusade against it this year.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said he is convinced the amendment
is having fatal consequences because AIDS service organizations
have not received new money since last November. He said the
federal Centers for Disease Control had asked them not to apply for
funds until the situation is clarified.
   ``We must oppose every attempt to censor vital lifesaving
information about AIDS,'' he said.
   The Senate agreed by voice vote Wednesday to another Helms
amendment to overturn the District of Columbia's ban on AIDS
testing for insurance applicants.
   Helms said diabetics and many other groups of people are unable
to get health insurance because of their conditions. His amendment
prevailed on a quick voice vote despite arguments by others that
Congress should not override a law passed by the D.C. City Council.
   The vote against the original Helms clean-needle amendment was
66-18.
   Several senators said the amendment was written so broadly it
would have denied hospices, hospitals, nursing homes and
researchers the use of hypodermics and syringes. And they said the
federal government shouldn't tie the hands of states, cities and
researchers trying to curb the spread of the fatal disease among
intravenous drug users.

<TEXT>
   The hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner left
Algeria without getting what they wanted and no concessions were
made to obtain the hostages' release, the Algerian ambassador said
today.
   Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun also said that while his government
would have liked to apprehend the hijackers, such a move would have
damaged its credibility as a mediator in international crises such
as attempts to obtain the release of American hostages in Lebanon.
   The United States has been pressing Algeria for information on
the deal it worked out last week for the release of 31 hostages
held by Moslem extremists in Algiers.
   U.S. officials said they do not have clear indications that the
pro-Iranian hijackers left Algeria, despite reports that they were
flown last Wednesday from Algiers to Syria and then made their way
to Lebanon.
   Sahnoun, addressing reporters at The National Press Club, said
the hijackers ``went back without achieving anything.''
   He declined to divulge details, saying that would be breaking
Algeria's word to the hijackers and would damage its role as a
mediator who has negotiated dozens of disputes over the past 25
years.
   ``We have a skill that we put at the disposal of the
international community,'' he said. ``This is not always
understood,'' he added, in apparent reference to demands by the
United States and other countries that Algeria help capture the
hijackers and bring them to trial.
   ``We delivered what we could deliver,'' namely the hostage
release, he said.
   ``There was a price to pay, we are not entirely satisfied'' that
the men went free, Sahnoun said. ``But this was a minimum price
compared with what they wanted.''
   The hijackers did not get what they wanted _ the release of 17
suspected terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait, he added.
   There have been reports that Kuwait cancelled the death sentence
against three of the 17. But Sahnoun insisted that ``no concessions
were made.''
   The Americans ``basically understood'' the Algerian position, he
said.
   Algeria has been asked to help in efforts to obtain the release
of some 20 hostages, among them eight Americans, believed held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon, he said.
   Algeria had in the past supplied information it obtained about
the hostages to their families, Sahnoun said.

<HEAD>Ruling Could Open Videotape Coffers to Performers Who Sold Movie
Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ruling may allow performers who sold
the rights to their work in films to make more money once those
movies are released on videotape.
   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held Wednesday that a
license giving a movie studio the right to show a film on
television does not necessarily apply to videotape sales.
   The court ruled in a case brought against Paramount Pictures
Corp. It involved the rights to the song ``Merry-Go-Round,''
written by Larry Fisher and used in the 1969 film ``Medium Cool.''
   Paramount officials declined to discuss the decision, but
industry attorneys said it may result in the renegotiation of tens
of thousands of licenses and contracts.
   Mainly affected will be movies made in the 1950s and '60s, after
television was invented but before the videocassette recorder
became popular enough for video rights to be included in contracts,
attorneys said.
   ``This will cause music publishers to re-examine their contracts
from the 1950s and beyond to see if they granted rights to
television only,'' said attorney Evan S. Cohen, who successfully
argued the case.
   ``There are probably a lot of contracts around just gathering
dust,'' said David Carson, an entertainment law specialist. ``Many
people may want to dust them off now.''
   In the Paramount case, a licensing agreement allowed the
filmmaker to use the song in television and theater showings of
``Medium Cool.'' Paramount argued that ``videocassette display is
the equivalent of `exhibition ... by means of television,''' said
Judge Proctor Hug Jr.
   But Hug wrote for the court: ``We cannot agree.''
   ``Though videocassettes may be displayed by using a television
monitor, it does not follow that, for copyright purposes,
videocassettes constitute `exhibition by television.'''
   A similar distinction caused several Jackson Browne songs to be
pulled from the 1982 film ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' when it
went into videotape production. The studio had not included
videotapes in the original agreement and was unable to negotiate
rights with Browne later, said the singer's attorney, Peter Paterno.
   How much money is at stake over such renegotiations is unclear.

   State security agents arrested at
least eight opposition leaders and sought others today hours before
a planned mass demonstration against the rule of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The arrest of all leaders of the National Civic Crusade was
ordered Wednesday night by Panama's attorney general under a law
prohibiting ``tumultuous meetings'' aimed at ``intimidating or
threatening'' others.
   The U.S. Southern Command told American servicemen and their
dependents in Panama to reduce the amount of time they spend in
public areas, citing the probability of demonstrations against
Noriega.
   The command also ordered Defense Department schools on the
Pacific end of the Panama Canal to close at noon EDT, said Capt.
Nancy LaLuntas, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
   The attorney general, Carlos A. Villalaz, said the order applied
to the 35 directors of the group, plus an unspecified number of
neighborhood leaders of the planned demonstration.
   Many crusade leaders have been in hiding since their
headquarters in a Panama City hotel was raided following a mass
demonstration on March 28. More than 40 people were arrested in
that sweep, including eight foreign journalists.
   All but one of those arrested last month were released within a
few days. The exception was Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, a top
leader of the group who was held for 10 days and then fled into
exile in Venezuela.
   The National Civic Crusade is a coalition of about 200
professional, labor, business, civic, political and other groups
that has been seeking Noriega's ouster since June. It is supported
by the United States, where Noriega is under indictment on drug
trafficking charges.
   Noriega is leader of the nation's defense forces and controls
the government. The United States has imposed sweeping economic
sanctions on Panama in an effort to force Noriega's ouster. The
sanctions have created a severe cash shortage in Panama.
   The National Civic Crusade announced plans last week for a
demonstration this afternoon along more than 30 blocks of the
capital's main commercial avenue. Largely through handbills and
word of mouth, it had been urging a massive turnout.
   The group has been unable to mount a large-scale demonstration
since last month's rally and march by an estimated 10,000
supporters was smashed by riot police and soldiers using water
cannons, tear gas, shotguns and rubber truncheons.
   Police arrested a number of opposition leaders a few days before
another planned mass demonstration last Oct. 22. None were held for
more than four days, but the demonstration collapsed for lack of
leadership and apparent fear of arrest by supporters.
   The attorney general said raids on several offices and homes by
state security agents earlier this week had turned up what he
called crusade plans for ``urban violence'' aimed at destabilizing
the country.
   Among offices raided were those of the Panama Industrial
Association, the Panamanian Odontological Association and the
National Medical Commission. All three organizations complained
that the raids were conducted without proper search warrants.
   Among those arrested was Enrique Marquez, president-elect of the
Panama Canal Society of Professional Engineers. The Society isued a
statement calling his detention ``one more proof of the constant
violation of human rights by the Defense Forces of the Republic of
Panama.''

   Their steps may be a bit slower, their
eyes dimmer, but oh how they remember the night 50 years ago when
residents danced away the last hours of four towns that died to
provide drinking water for Boston.
   More than 100 former residents _ the oldest in her 90s _ and 300
descendants of the Swift River Valley towns gathered Wednesday for
the 50th anniversary of the last dance at Enfield Town Hall.
   And they remembered the night of April 27, 1938, when the towns
of Dana, Prescott, Enfield and Greenwich flickered out of existence
at midnight to create the Quabbin Reservoir.
   The reservoir took 20 years to build and cost $53 million and
the lives of more than 20 workers. Today, it provides drinking
water for 2.5 million people, half of the state's population.
   It's not the nation's largest reservoir, though none larger has
been built strictly to provide drinking water. But for 2,500
people, the land under the water had been home. The ball marked the
end of that life.
   ``My mother was crying. The older people were heartbroken,''
recalled Lucille Webster Thresher, dancing with Harrison, her
husband of 50 years. They were the last couple married in Enfield.
They remember the ball.
   ``There was such a crowd at Town Hall that night we young people
couldn't get in,'' she said. ``We climbed the fire escape and
looked in the windows.''
   A hush fell over the crowd in the ballroom at the University of
Massachusetts as the bell that had once hung in the Dana Town Hall
struck midnight.
   Robert Garvey, the High Sheriff of Hampshire County, dressed in
top hat and tails, led the former residents in singing ``Auld Lang
Syne'' just as the dancers had in 1938.
   Men who had been young then bowed their heads. Tears glistened
in many eyes as the sound of ``Taps'' echoed across the stilled
ballroom.
   ``Our home was in the center of town. It now lies under the
deepest part of the reservoir,'' said Joy Dickinson Bock, a South
Hadley elementary school teacher, who was in grade school back then.
   ``My parents had six children and they couldn't afford to go to
the dance. But we kids went down to the Town Hall and watched the
people arriving,'' she said.
   Her brother, Richard Dickinson, came from Indianapolis for the
event as did three sisters and another brother.
   ``I wouldn't have missed this for the world,'' said Trudy Ward
Stalbird Terry, 78, of Enfield, as 38 former residents who had been
at the Farewell Ball led the Grand March around the hall.
   Many of the women wore heirloom pins and other mementos of
parents and grandparents. Some wore black as did many of the women
at the dance 50 years ago.
   Their reminiscences, jotted down on their dance programs, were
read aloud between dance tunes.
   ``My son is 50 now. He was one of the last babies born in
Enfield,'' said Gladys Hanks of Somers, Conn.
   She and her husband Roy, 75, married others when they lived in
Enfield. They did not meet again until they both began attending
the weekly teas held for former residents at the Quabbin Visitors
Center.
   They were married on Valentine's Day in 1987.
   ``We didn't think we ought to waste any time,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A California condor chick, inspired by
recordings of vulture hisses and grunts, was slowly chipping its
way out of its shell today, San Diego Wild Animal Park officials
said.
   ``Everything is proceeding fine,'' park spokeswoman Martha Baker
said this morning. ``The chick is moving around inside the shell
and the condor keepers can hear the chick tapping.''
   ``What we're trying to do is provide a natural stimulus to the
bird to assist it in hatching,'' spokesman Tom Hanscom said
Wednesday.
   The chick, the first ever of the nearly extinct species to be
conceived in captivity, began its three-day struggle to break free
of its blue-green egg early Wednesday.
   A successful hatching would raise the population to 28. All 27
California condors are in captivity, 14 at the Wild Animal Park and
13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Baker said park officials still expect the chick to hatch Friday
or Saturday. If the chick hasn't emerged from its shell by 4 a.m.
Saturday, keepers likely will help it out, Hanscom said.
   Meanwhile, keepers are playing recordings of bird noises and
gently tapping the egg with a light metal rod every two hours to
simulate what condor parents would do to encourage the youth, he
said.
   The chick has settled into a rhythm of pecking and resting,
punctuated by cheeps, and appears to be strong and healthy, said
Bill Toone, curator of birds at the park.
   ``At this point, it will continue to push at the pip hole and
situate itself so that it will attempt to cap the egg,'' Hanscom
said, referring to the chick's chipping all the way around the egg
so it can push the upper third of the shell away from the rest.
   The egg is being watched on a remote television monitor but
keepers are reluctant to help the chick because of the danger that
blood vessels linked to a surrounding membrane will rupture, which
could cause fatal bleeding.
   Since 1983, there have been 14 successful condor hatchings at
the Wild Animal Park and the affiliated San Diego Zoo involving
eggs taken from the wild. All of those hatchings occurred with
human help, although one of those chicks died of an infection 24
hours after birth.
   The egg was laid March 3 at the park's ``condorminium'' after
its parents engaged in the first captive mating in the history of a
15-year program aimed at saving North America's largest land bird.
California condors, which are scavengers, have wing spans of up to
10 feet.
   State and federal wildlife officials overseeing the condor
program decided to remove the remaining condors in the wild to
focus efforts on a captive breeding flock. The last known
California condor in the wild was captured in April 1987.

   The state that's home to the Grand Canyon
and the Petrified Forest will soon acquire another natural wonder _
a spectacular 2{-mile cavern kept secret for years for fear it
would be vandalized.
   The Legislature and Gov. Rose Mofford on Wednesday rushed to
enact legislation allowing the state to acquire the cavern
discovered 14 years ago near Benson in southeast Arizona.
   Mrs. Mofford perched a spelunker's helmet atop her beehive
hairdo as she signed the bill passed by lawmakers only an hour
earlier.
   The cave's existence had been a closely held secret since it was
discovered in 1974, because its owners feared vandals would destroy
its beauty.
   ``It is a major natural resource find,'' said state Park Board
Director Kenneth Travous, who has twice squeezed through the tiny
opening to view the cavern.
   ``It's fabulous,'' Travous said. ``Walt Disney couldn't have
done any better for the state of Arizona. Your imagination goes
crazy when you get down there.''
   The cavern is about 13,000 feet long with rooms the size of
football fields and ceilings from 50 to 100 feet high. Thousands of
still-growing stalagmites and stalactites ranging from a few inches
to 60 feet are found throughout. It's also home to a colony of 700
bats.
   In about three years, Travous says, about 100,000 to 150,000
people a year will get to travel by elevator to see the cave.
Officials plan to use state park revenues to acquire the site for
$1.6 million within a year from the Arizona Nature Conservancy,
which soon will buy the site from the family of the late James
Kartchner, a Cochise County rancher and educator.
   ``I imagine I walked over this thing I don't know how many times
hunting deer'' but never realized the cavern was underneath, said
Rep. Gus Arzberger, whose district includes the cave.
   The state on Friday sent park rangers to guard the site on an
emergency basis as word of the cavern's existence began to leak
out. The bill was quickly enacted Wednesday to allow the state to
continue to oversee the land.
   The cavern's co-discoverer, Randy Tufts, 39, said that finding
it along with Gary Tenen, 37, was ``a once in a lifetime discovery
for the caver.''
   ``People go out and hunt and hunt and hunt for caves; 99 times
out of 100 you never find anything,'' Tufts said.
   Tufts said he and Tenen wanted the cavern turned into a park
because that would be the best way to protect it from vandals.
Because it is near a major highway, Tufts said it was inevitable
that other people would find it.
   Tufts said he had been into the cavern hundreds of times.
   ``It's very colorful ... The variety of formations is very
wide,'' and it still is an actively changing cave, Tufts said.
   Four of Kartchner's 12 children attended Wednesday's legislative
session and bill-signing. Dean Kartchner, a physician, said family
members were aware of the cave but not its splendor.
   ``We climbed in it, there were rattlesnakes, and we climbed back
out (with) no idea of the magnificence of the structure,''
Kartchner said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today accused the United States
of violating the Afghan accords by sending new arms to rebels
fighting to topple the communist government in Afghanistan.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev said the
United States was violating its obligations as a guarantor of the
Geneva agreement on a Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   At a news briefing, Perfiliev said that if news reports saying
the United States was resupplying Afghan guerrillas are true,
Washington would be violating its pledge not to interfere in
Afghanistan's internal affairs.
   A U.S. official told The Associated Press in Islamabad,
Pakistan, on Wednesday that Washington was airlifting arms to the
guerrillas to replace weapons destroyed when a Pakistani ammunition
depot exploded April 10.
   Perfiliev also declined comment on a Pravda article that raised
the question of whether the Soviet Union would accept pro-Soviet
Afghan refugees in the event of a rebel takeover. He said he had
not seen the article.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper today published a report on
Afghanistan that was highly unusual in depicting the concerns of
Afghan party and military officials about the implications of the
Soviet troop withdrawal, scheduled to begin May 15.
   The Soviets have an estimated 115,000 soldiers in Afghanistan.
   More typical reports in the state-run media have said the April
14 Geneva agreement, which commits the Soviets to a pullout,
increases opportunities for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan's
10-year-old civil war.
   But many Western observers doubt the Marxist government of
President Najib, which was unable to defeat a widespread insurgency
with Soviet aid, will be able to withstand guerrilla attacks once
the Soviets are gone.
   ``In questions and replies, you could sense the deep alarm
evinced by ... those people who have actively fought the
counterrevolution: What will become of them when we leave?'' wrote
Col. P. Studenikin, a Pravda special correspondent.
   There have been reports that the Soviet Union has issued cards
to top members of Najib's People's Democratic Party and government
to allow them to board Soviet-bound planes if the guerrillas gain
the upper hand. Those reports have never been confirmed.
   The Afghan civil war has forced more than 5 million people to
flee, chiefly to neighboring Pakistan and Iran. Few of them, if
any, back the Najib government.
   Studenikin wrote that some people have asked whether the Soviets
have agreed to take 500,000 Afghan refuguees.
   The article, titled ``The Road Home,'' gave clear indications of
the joy and relief felt by Soviets as their country's military
involvement in Afghanistan, which began in December 1979, is about
to end. According to Western estimates, as many as 10,000 Soviet
soldiers have been killed.
   Pravda said it had received thousands of letters from its
readers about the withdrawal, which Soviet officials have said
privately should be concluded by the end of the year.
   Studenikin wrote: ``I feel like telling all of them who will
soon be taking this road home ... `The whole country with
impatience awaits your return.'''

   Masked gunmen shot and killed a South
Yemeni businessman today as left his home to catch an early flight
to Belgrade, police said.
   A police spokesman identified the businessman as Abdul Mohammed
Kashim or Kasim, 39, and said he carried a South Yemen diplomatic
passport.
   Two gunmen got out of a parked car as Kashim walked out of an
apartment block at 4:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m. Wednesday EDT) in the
suburb of Old Phaleron, said the spokesman, who requested anonymity
in accordance with Greek practice.
   Kashim carried his luggage and was accompanied by his
sister-in-law, the spokesman said.
   One of the men opened fire with a sawed-off shotgun, hitting
Kashim in the elbow and abdomen. As the businessmen tried to flee,
the gunman ran after him and fired twice more, hitting him in the
head, the spokesman said.
   Kashim's sister-in-law was not hurt, he said.
   The gunmen got away, and no group immediately claimed
responsibility for the killing.
   A police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Kashim had been living in Greece with his wife and family for the
past year, and was planning to open a supermarket in Athens.
   ``He apparently was selling off some businesses in Lebanon and
was transferring his activities to Greece,'' the source said.
   There is no South Yemen embassy in Athens. A Foreign Ministry
official said Kashim was not registered as a foreign diplomat
resident in Greece.
   The police spokesman said Kashim was booked on an early morning
Yugoslav Airlines flight to Belgrade.
   The last attack against an Arab in the Greek capital took place
in December 1987, when an Iraqi diplomat working for the Arab
League was shot and wounded while driving through the Psychico
suburb.
   Past attacks here have included killings of Libyan exiles and
PLO officials and attempts against Jordanian and Iraqi diplomats.
None of the cases has been solved.

<HEAD>Judge Bars Girl Scouts From Withdrawing Charter of Inner-City

   A federal judge today barred the national
Girl Scouts organization from withdrawing the charter of an
inner-city council that serves more than 2,000 girls.
   Parents and troop leaders of the Hudson County council oppose
the plans of the national organization to transfer jurisdiction of
their scouts, who are mostly members of minority groups, to mainly
white, suburban councils.
   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman ordered the national
organization to show why the Hudson County council should not
receive a new six-year charter.
   The parents said they found it particularly galling that the
national group would try to end their charter when pictures of
Hudson Girl Scouts and troop leaders have appeared on a nationally
distributed poster extolling the Girl Scouts as an integrated
organization.
   The national organization has said the charter should be
withheld because of declining membership and financial difficulties.
   The girls would be ``better served by councils with strong
management systems and better resources,'' said national
spokeswoman Bonnie McEwan in New York. She refused to comment
further on the Hudson County case.
   However, Ms. McEwan said she did not know of any other time the
Girl Scouts had sought to remove or withhold a charter from one of
the nation's 335 local councils, which include nearly 3 million
adult and scout members.
   Councils are responsible for organizing troops, recruiting
leaders and providing services for the troops, Ms. McEwan said.
   The Hudson County parents argued that they can best provide
well-integrated and family-like scouting groups in the inner-city
setting of their Hudson River waterfront communities.
   Pictures of the local scouts and troop leaders also have
appeared on Girl Scout cookie boxes and a 75th anniversary
commemorative stamp, the council said.
   ``They liked all those ethnic backgrounds,'' said Maria DeBlois,
a Girl Scout mother and troop leader. ``I don't understand (why)
they want to split that up.''
   Mrs. DeBlois, nine other mothers and the council sued Girl
Scouts USA in federal court here. The suit also accuses the
national organization of seeking to distribute proceeds from the
$635,000 sale of a Hudson Council campground.

   Decorations stolen from cemeteries in
six counties have been returned by authorities who captured a
69-year-old woman with help from relatives guarding a burial plot.
   Elanor Hartley of Hueytown pleaded guilty to taking decorations
from hundreds of graves, a Jefferson County sheriff's deputy said.
   Sheriff's Sgt. J.O. Duke said about 500 decorations, ranging
from saddles used to hold floral arrangements, to vases and other
items were recovered at the woman's house.
   Hartley was fined $200 on April 13 and ordered to undergo
psychiatric counseling. She also received a suspended six-month
jail term and was put on two years' probation.
   Duke said Tuesday he went to the woman's home after relatives of
a 15-year-old girl who died of heart problems solved the case. Duke
said Hartley hid under her bed and ``I had to drag her out after I
confronted her with what happened.''
   Duke said the woman admitted stealing decorations at 34
cemeteries, and said he eventually returned all of the stolen
decorations.
   ``Only the good Lord knows why she did it,'' Duke said, adding
it took four truckloads to return the decorations.
   The deputy said relatives of a deceased 15-year-old had taken
turns standing guard at a Jefferson County cemetery after wind
chimes began to disappear. One of the relatives noticed a woman
taking objects from graves and told authorities after jotting down
her car's license number.
   When he arrived at Hartley's house, Duke said, he saw the six
stolen wind chimes dangling from her front porch.
   Duke estimated 300 families had noticed cemetery thefts and many
had reported them to authorities in their counties.

<TEXT>
   George Bush, the Republican presidential nominee in all but
name, expressed eagerness to debate Michael Dukakis and challenged
the Democratic front-runner to ``fire away.'' Dukakis did just that
_ and so did Jesse Jackson, who criticized both men today in Ohio.
   Jackson, falling further behind Dukakis every week in the
Democratic race, received cheers at a Steubenville rally with a
speech focusing on fighting drugs and saving jobs.
   ``I don't want to manage Reaganomics as Dukakis does, or keep
Reaganomics as Bush does,'' Jackson said. ``I want to reverse
Reaganomics and re-invest in America.''
   ``This is a tight race. ... It is closer now than ever before,''
Jackson said a day earlier as he campaigned in Ohio, where 159
delegates are at stake in Tuesday's contest. He had a series of
stops set around the state today.
   Indiana and the District of Columbia also vote Tuesday, offering
79 and 16 Democratic delegates respectively.
   
   
   Bush now has more than enough delegates to assure him the GOP
nomination. His boss, President Reagan, is holding off on a formal
endorsement but the White House indicated that one is near.
   Republican Party and administration sources said Reagan planned
to play a low-key role at the GOP's convention in August to avoid
upstaging Bush. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the president would address the convention on opening night _
Monday, Aug. 15 _ and then leave the next morning for California.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis remained reluctant to describe
himself as the likely nominee despite a string of wins and a
widening delegate lead. Any reference to a fall faceoff with Bush
is cautiously qualified with an if.
   But Dukakis was sounding increasingly relaxed and confident. He
sent the Boston Bruins hockey team a telegram Wednesday following a
win over the Montreal Canadiens that advanced them to the
semifinals in the Stanley Cup series.
   ``Having enjoyed a few wins myself lately, I can well imagine
how you feel,'' the governor wrote. ``Maybe your winning formula
will rub off on me as I enter some playoffs of my own.''
   The Massachusetts governor said there was ``no question'' that
if nominated, he would debate the Republican nominee.
   ``I've already agreed to,'' he said. ``I'd be delighted.''
   Bush said he, too, was ready. ``I will have debates and I look
forward to it,'' he told CNN.
   The vice president has criticized Dukakis for lacking foreign
policy experience. The Massachusetts governor retaliated Wednesday
by questioning Bush's role in ``one of the most misguided
adventures in the history of American foreign policy'' _ the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``I can't imagine what they (in the White House) were thinking
of when they proceeded to do business with a terrorist nation,''
Dukakis said in Springfield, Mass.
   Where foreign policy is concerned, he added later, ``it's your
values, it's the quality of the people you pick. ... That's what
makes for strong international leadership.''
   Bush, in Washington, said he expected Dukakis to try to make the
Iran-Contra affair a campaign issue. ``Let him fire away,'' he said.
   Dukakis, in New Jersey for a fund-raiser on Wednesday night,
also attacked the Reagan administration record on environmental
issues, saying: ``It's about time we had an administration that did
something about the environment.''
   And, questioning whether Bush backed Reagan's threat to veto a
trade measure that won congressional approval on Wednesday, Dukakis
said: ``I think the vice president would be well advised to stop
criticizing others for a while and address some fundamental issues
facing this country.''
   Reagan objects to a provision of the bill that would provide
workers with 60 days notice before a plant shuts down.
Massachusetts has a plant-closing law, but it does not require
companies to notify the state of impending shutdowns, and critics
say the measure lacks teeth.
   In other developments:
   _The Federal Election Commission earmarked $2 million in
matching funds to current and former presidential candidates on
Wednesday. The candidate who has received the most matching funds
overall _ $8.6 million _ is Pat Robertson, who technically remains
a Republican candidate although Bush has the delegates needed to
nominate.
   Robertson has congratulated Bush on wrapping up the nomination
and pledged to help elect a Republican.
   _A commission formed by the major political parties said four
cities and dates have been tentatively chosen for presidential
debates this fall. They are: Annapolis, Md., Sept. 14;
Winston-Salem, N.C., Sept. 25; Omaha, Neb., Oct. 11 and Pittsburgh,

made commitments.

   An unemployed handyman convicted of
strangling seven women while having sex, then leaving their bodies
to rot in and near his apartment, told a judge today he did not
want a jury to decide whether he should get the death penalty.
   ``I want you,'' Harrison ``Marty'' Graham said when Common Pleas
Court Judge Robert Latrone told him a jury could be called in to
set the sentence.
   Graham, 29, was convicted Wednesday of murder and abuse of
corpse charges. He had waived a jury trial, but under Pennsylvania
law retained the right to have a jury for the sentencing portion of
the case.
   Graham lured the women to his apartment with the promise of
drugs then strangled them during sex, according to his own
confession to police.
   ``He deserves everything he gets,'' said Camilia DeShazor
Parker, the mother of one of Graham's victims, Robin DeShazor. ``I
still hate him.''
   Leroy Artison, the father of another victim, Sandra Garvin,
said, ``I'm just numb. The way I feel is that there's nothing that
can be done for my daughter. She is gone.''
   Graham's mother, Lillian, seated in the first row of the City
Hall courtroom, sat quietly and refused to comment later. Graham
did not testify during the trial, which started March 7.
   Latrone, who heard the case without a jury, deliberated for six
days before rendering his verdict, and Assistant District Attorney
Roger King said afterwards that the state would ``actively seek the
death penalty.''
   In his confession admitted into evidence, Graham said the bodies
began piling up in his bedroom and he began having problems with
maggots. He also said birds eating body parts on his roof made
sleeping during the day difficult.
   The bodies were found last Aug. 9 and 10 after Graham was
evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench. He lived in
a drug-infested north Philadelphia neighborhood where he was known
as a handyman.
   Police pried open a nailed door to find six rotting bodies in
Graham's bedroom, leg and foot bones on the roof of his apartment
house and a torso in the basement of a neighboring house.
   Graham surrendered to police Aug. 16 at his mother's urging.
   Defense attorney Joel S. Moldovsky tried unsuccessfully to have
the statement suppressed, arguing the confession was made in
violation of Graham's constitutional rights and that Graham was
beaten by police during 17 hours of interrogation.
   Moldovsky also asked Latrone to find Graham innocent by reason
of insanity, characterizing the defendant as both psychotic and
mentally retarded.

   The FBI has disbanded a task force investigating
the case of a teen-ager who was mysteriously assaulted because
agents have found no evidence the teen-ager' civil rights were
violated, according to a report published today.
   Meanwhile, Tawana Brawley's mother and a spokesman for the
family insist Miss Brawley will tell her story of the
still-unexplained assault to the public, not to a state grand jury,
unless a federal grand jury probe is launched.
   Glenda Brawley, the victim's mother, said Wednesday the family
would go to jail rather than force Miss Brawley to honor a request
to testify contained in a letter from the grand jury that Mrs.
Brawley called ``dumb.''
   The 16-year-old teen-ager will ignore the Monday deadline set in
the letter and will tell her story to the public at the end of this
week if no federal investigation is launched, the Rev. Al Sharpton
said Wednesday.
   Family members have described the incident as a sexual and
racial assault on the teen-ager last fall.
   But three of the four agents investigating the case for
violations of federal law have been reassigned since last week,
leaving behind one agent to compile a report, according to today's
Middletown Times Herald-Record.
   Sources close to the investigation say the FBI report won't be
complete for another month.
   Sharpton said the grand jury had written to Miss Brawley and her
mother, Glenda, asking the youngster to come forward and warning
that the panel could take action to try to force her to tell her
story if she refuses to cooperate.
   ``It's dumb,'' Glenda Brawley said of the grand jury's appeal.
``We've been through all this before. What makes them think we're
going to all of a sudden bring Tawana down there and talk to them?''
   ``We think the federal government would move in much more
impartially than Mr. Abrams has shown us at this point,'' said
Sharpton, referring to state Attorney General Robert Abrams, who is
the special prosecutor for the Brawley case.
   The FBI has had an agent assigned to the case since the then
15-year-old black girl was found Nov. 28 outside her family's
former apartment in Wappingers Falls, and the other three agents
were added in February.
   After a four-day disappearance, the teen-ager was found huddled
in a trash bag with racial slurs scrawled on her torso and feces
smeared on her body. She told family members she was a victim of a
sexual and racial assault involving six white men, one of whom
flashed a police-like badge.

   Federal prosecutors are increasingly concerned
about vacancies at the top of the Justice Department which Attorney
General Edwin Meese III has been unable to fill for nearly a month.
   U.S. attorneys held a lengthy discussion about the vacancy in
the department's No. 2 post, concluding in an informal vote that
they want one of their colleagues, rather than someone from outside
the department, to fill the position, said three department
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The consensus at Tuesday's meeting at the Justice Department was
that Robert Ulrich, the U.S. attorney in Kansas City, should be
chosen by Meese to become deputy attorney general, said the sources.
   Ulrich is chairman of the U.S. attorneys' advisory committee,
but was not in the room at the time of the discussion by the
panel's 15 or so members, said the sources.
   ``The sense at the meeting was that the U.S. attorneys wanted
Ulrich,'' said one source. ``They want someone who knows and
understands U.S. attorneys and who can hit the ground running.''
   The sources said the U.S. attorneys had not presented their
views to Meese, who was in California on Wednesday, and that it was
unclear whether they would do so.
   ``Neither Ed Meese nor anyone else has offered me the position
of deputy attorney general,'' Ulrich told the Kansas City Times
from his home Wednesday night. He declined further comment.
   The post of deputy attorney general became vacant last Friday
with the departure of Arnold Burns, who resigned March 29, telling
colleagues Meese's refusal to resign in the face of a nearly
yearlong criminal investigation was damaging Justice Department
operations. Criminal division chief William Weld resigned with
Burns for similar reasons.
   The concerns by U.S. attorneys about the top-level Justice
Department vacancies come amid a report that a group of President
Reagan's advisers and friends have joined forces to oust Meese.
   Reagan reacted heatedly when reporters queried him about the
Wall Street Journal report, which said Nancy Reagan supported the
effort.
   ``I thought the story was totally inaccurate,'' said Reagan, who
when asked what might prompt him to get rid of Meese, said: ``Well,
if he had a complete change of character.''
   The Journal said White House officials sounded out former
Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger as a possible successor to
Meese, but that Weinberger rejected the proposal.
   In an interview with CNN, Weinberger said: ``I did not have any
suggestion that Mr. Meese should leave, and under no circumstances
whatever would I even take the office, if it should be offered.
It's never been offered.''
   Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times reported today that aides to
Vice President George Bush and White House chief of staff Howard
Baker were privately involved in efforts to force Meese from office.
   The newspaper did not identify the aides but said they have
spread the word among Republican supporters in Congress that Meese,
by remaining in office, is weakening the Reagan presidency and
could jeopardize Bush's election campaign to succeed Reagan.
   At the Justice Department, spokesman Patrick Korten said Meese
had flown to California to attend a funeral on Wednesday and had a
full work schedule Thursday.
   ``The attorney general not only has a full schedule for the rest
of the week, but for the next couple of months. He is preparing for
events in July and August. There is no question in my mind that he
intends to fulfill his obligations as attorney general for the
foreseeable future,'' Korten said.
   Meese has made two unsuccessful bids to fill Burns' post.
   St. Louis attorney John Shepherd withdrew from consideration
amid allegations by a former bookkeeper at his law firm that the
two had an affair, and reports about his membership in all-white
and all-male clubs. Shepherd denied the bookkeepers' allegations,
but said the ensuing strain on his family had become intolerable.
   Earlier, former federal appeals court judge Arlin Adams rejected
Meese's overtures to become deputy attorney general, saying he had
a heavy caseload at his Philadelphia law firm.
   The office of deputy attorney general is vital to the effective
functioning of the 93 U.S. attorneys' offices. The deputy makes key
budget decisions that affect the offices and settles disputes
between them.
   The advisory committee is an administrative group designed to
keep the attorney general in touch with activities in the various
U.S. attorneys' offices around the country.

   Two airmen aboard an unarmed National Guard
reconnaissance jet ejected and parachuted to safety just after the
plane crash-landed, officials said today.
   The F-4 jet, returning from a training flight, crashed Wednesday
night at Reno-Cannon International Airport and showered debris for
800 yards, said Jim Landsberry, airport spokesman.
   ``They touched down and ejected and, luckily, they both walked
away from it,'' National Guard spokesman Mike Reed said today.
   The aircraft had an ``in-flight emergency'' and landing problems
that forced the crew to eject, according to Reed, who said the jet
veered left when it touched down.
   The National Guard would not disclose the nature of the
emergency, and an investigation could take several months, Reed
said.
   Reed identified the two crewmen as Lt. Col. Ronald J. Bath and
Capt. William R. Burks.
   Reed said Bath, a 43-year-old attorney, was the pilot and had
more than 1,300 hours flight time in similar planes; Burks, a
33-year-old accountant, was navigator.
   Burks was treated and released from Washoe Medical Center, but
Bath remained in the hospital for observation because of a back
injury. He was expected to be released shortly, Reed said.

   A hydroelectric plant built with
assistance from a U.S. group has brought electricity to the world's
highest monastery near the base of Mount Everest, a report said
Thursday.
   The experimental 20-kilowatt station for the Thyangboche
monastery will provide an alternative to firewood in the Everest
region, according to the King Mahendra Trust for Nature
Conservation.
   Forest Secretary Birendra Nath Khujeli said Wednesday at the
plant's inauguration that the support of the San Francisco-based
American Himalayan Foundation had been timely.
   New Zealand Ambassador Sir Edmund Hillary, who in 1953 became
the first man to conquer the 29,028-foot Mount Everest, called the
project ``an outstanding gesture for conserving forests.''
   American Himalayan Foundation President Richard Blum, the
husband of former San Fransisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, said his
group had raised nearly $100,000 for the project. Blum added he had
``come from halfway around the world to appreciate this unique area
of Nepal.''
   The trust did not say if Nepalese government funds also were
used to build the plant or give other details.
   Thyangboche is a popular with tourists in Nepal, with more than
7,000 visiting the monastery last year.

   The journal Red Flag, which once was required
reading for people trying to figure out trends within the Chinese
Communist Party, soon will cease publication, a pro-Beijing
newspaper said Thursday.
   The Wen Wei Po newspaper said Red Flag will stop publication in
late June and merge with Theory Monthly, a journal run by the
central party school, to form a new publication, Seek Truth. The
title comes from a slogan often used by Chinese leaders: ``Seek
truth from facts.''
   Red Flag, which has come out twice a month for three decades,
formerly was required reading for Chinese and foreigners seeking to
understand theoretical and political trends within the Communist
Party.
   It recently has gained a reputation as a bastion for the
old-guard conservative line being displaced by China's pragmatic,
reform-minded leadership.

<HEAD>Unauthenticated Renoir Sells For $1.7 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROUBAIX, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A painting attributed to impressionist
Auguste Renoir was sold privately for $1.7 million despite doubts
as to its authenticity.
   Experts say the painting of a naked woman reclining on a green
cushion was too erotic to be a real Renoir. The 19th century master
is best known for idealizing the female form, which he portrayed in
cozy indoor settings as well as in the sun-washed outdoors.
   The sale originally was to be handled by Claude Dassonval,
director of the Septentrion Gallery in the northern French town of
Marcq-en-Baroeul. Dassonval said he withdrew his services after the
owner refused to have it formally examined by recognized experts.
   ``And she (the nude) was in too provocative a pose to have been
the work of Renoir,'' he said.
   He declined to provide the names of either the seller or the
buyer.
   Dassonval said experts first thought the work was Renoir's
``Nude on a Green Cushion,'' last sold in 1933. The painting has
been in a private collection since then.
   They changed their minds after comparing photographs published
in the auction catalogue with the painting in Roubaix.

<TEXT>
   African National Congress
leader Govan Mbeki has filed a court challenge against restrictions
imposed on him after his release from prison last year, his lawyer
said Thursday.
   Mbeki, 77, was freed in November after serving 23 years of a
life sentence imposed on him, Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders
at a sabotage and subversion trial in 1964.
   Upon release, Mbkei reaffirmed his commitment to the outlawed
guerrilla movement, and the government imposed restrictions on him.
He was barred from making speeches, giving interviews and
participating in politics, and he was confined to the area around
his home city of Port Elizabeth.
   No date has been set for a hearing of the case.
   Mbeki's lawyer, Priscilla Jana, said an application was filed
last week challenging the national state of emergency, which makes
provisions for restrictions such as those imposed on Mbeki.
   He also is agruing that his individual restriction is too vague
to be lawful and was issued by police without proper authority, she
said.
   As part of the challenge, legal papers have been served on
President P.W. Botha, who declared the state of emergency in June
1986.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has chosen a low-profile role
at the Republican National Convention that will name George Bush as
his would-be successor, administration and Republican Party sources
say.
   Reagan is waiting to give Bush a formal endorsement, but
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said nothing should be made
of that.
   ``He will endorse the vice president,'' Fitzwater said today.
``We don't have a specific point for that to happen yet but it will
be at some event where they will appear jointly, probably within
the next couple of weeks.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan talked campaign strategy privately with
Bush over lunch Wednesday and said the president plans to help
wherever he can.
   During a picture-taking session Wednesday, Reagan said Bush
deserved congratulations for locking up the GOP nomination. Asked
if he was ready to endorse Bush, he replied, ``Well, I'm going to
have to arrive at that since there are no others entering'' the
Republican presidential competition.
   During a Cable News Network interview, Bush said ``we've got to
discuss that, whether it will be some formal endorsement. But when
there will be some formal endorsement ceremony, we didn't have any
agreement on that.''
   Administration and Republican Party sources, discussing plans
for the GOP convention on grounds they remain anonymous, said
Reagan doesn't want to steal the limelight from Bush.
   They said Reagan decided to address the New Orleans convention
on opening night, Monday, Aug. 15. The sources also said, however,
that he will not give the keynote address.
   The president's scheduling decision causes convention organizers
to juggle the speakers' lineup.
   ``I think the president's view is that this is going to be a
convention for the next nominee of the Republican Party,'' one
source said. ``It's the president's view that wherever he goes, he
tends to be the focal point, so he wants to do it this way.''
   Reagan would leave for his California ranch on Tuesday morning,
the source said.
   Another source said that there has been discussion of a Reagan
televised address to the convention on the night Bush accepts the
nomination but that no decisions have been made.

<TEXT>
   A family reunion led a deputy U.S. marshal
to renew an investigation into four 1980 killings that has resulted
in the arrests of three people _ one of them his own brother.
   The break in the investigation into the slayings of four elderly
people began at a 1986 reunion when Olbert Hiett took a sawed-off
shotgun from his brother, Charles Hiett, because it was an illegal
weapon.
   District Attorney Robert Field, who recounted the chain of
events, said Hiett's nephew, Jerry Hiett, was arrested for
allegedly starting a fire later that year in Talladega National
Forest, and a .38-caliber pistol was recovered.
   Olbert Hiett then realized that the two guns matched the
descriptions of guns used in four slayings at a rural house on Jan.
3, 1980. The victims were James Columbus Roberts, 79, Mack Roberts,
73, Mae Bell Roberts, 77, and Floy Roberts, 63, and two of them
were bedridden when shot to death.
   Ballistics tests confirmed Olbert Hiett's suspicions, and
Charles and Jerry Hiett and Anthony Bell were arrested this week.
   Charles Hiett, 51, was arrested on one count of hindering
prosecution and one count of possession of a sawed-off shotgun,
Cleburne County Sheriff Jack Norton said. Jerry Hiett, 39, was
charged with five counts of perjury. Bell, 29, was arrested
Wednesday on charges of first-degree perjury.
   Norton refused to comment on the timing of the arrests or
whether the three were suspects in the killings. ``I'm just going
to say they are people whom the grand jury saw fit to indict on
those charges,'' Norton said.
   The arrests came on indictments returned Tuesday by a county
grand jury. The three men were being held in county jail in lieu of
$100,000 bond each.
   Field said the grand jury will reconvene May 31 and that more
indictments might be returned.
   Authorities said that Olbert Hiett's seizure of the shotgun
provided the first major break in their investigation.
   ``Without him, there would be no case,'' U.S. Marshal Thomas
Green of Huntsville said. ``It's an unusual story. My deputy has
been involved in this indirectly since 1983 and directly involved
since 1986.''
   Olbert Hiett's niece, Teresa Loveless, said she is not angry at
him although he has worked to put her father, Charles Hiett, in
jail.
   ``This isn't a vengeance thing,'' she said. ``They didn't have
any falling out or anything like that. My uncle is a lawman and he
is just doing his job. My father is just telling the truth _ that's
all there is to it.''
   Police believe the motive in the killing was $1,500 in cash kept
in a trunk. The trunk was stolen and recovered two years later in
woods three miles from the Roberts home.

   It will send 26,000 tons of wheat, 6,000 tons of vegetable
seeds, 220 tons of edible oil, 315 tons of canned meat or fish and
93 tons of biscuits to Ethiopia to help 310,000 refugees from Sudan

   Non-residents are required to mail in requests for the badges on

   Last year, the association charged 125 dollars for four badges

   A collection of more than 100 bowls and

here Thursday, the first stop on a world tour that will end with an
auction of the works in Geneva.
   The 108 pieces of glasswork, estimated at about $9 million, will

the pieces have not been seen in public since the 1900 World's Fair

   Galle, 1846-1904, has long been considered a genius of French
glassmaking and was a native of the eastern city of Nancy, a
traditional center of this art. His bowls and vases are best known
for their graceful shapes, unusual design and rich colors.
   The collection, to be auctioned June 27 by the Swiss company
Habsburg Feldamn, includes ``Rhubarb Coup,'' a bowl created in
1903, which brought $535,000 at auction in 1979.

   More than 1,700 people likely will die in
the next seven years from illnesses caused by the Bhopal gas leak,
the 1984 disaster that already has killed nearly 3,000 people, a
report said Thursday.
   The predictions were contained in a $285 million plan by the
Madhya Pradesh state government for providing relief to both future
and past Bhopal victims and their families.
   The seven-year plan is based on a projected annual death rate of
250 people. Among those targeted for financial help are 509 women
widowed by the tragedy and 27 orphans, the state report said.
   The world's worst industrial disaster already has killed at
least 2,998 people, the report said, a figure higher than the
previously reported death toll of 2,800.
   It said the deaths were ``conclusively attributed'' to the
effects of the toxic methyl-isocyanate gas that was released on
Dec. 3, 1984, from a plant owned by a pesticide subsidiary of the
Union Carbide Corp., based in Danbury, Conn.
   The central Indian state's study said another 816 deaths were
being investigated for links to the gas leak.
   The Indian government has said in the past that it expected the
death toll to rise, but Thursday's report was the first time it has
detailed the anticipated scope of the casualties.
   ``It is not possible to assess the long-term damage,'' said the
report released by the state's chief minister, Arjun Singh, in the
State Assembly.
   India already has spent $46 million to assist disaster victims.
   Many victims develop respiratory problems that progress to the
point where they cause death. Others became more prone to other
diseases whose symptoms include fever, vomiting and diarrhea.
   The government said it also is conducting surveys to determine
if the children of women exposed to the gas have a higher incidence
of birth defects.
   The report calls for the creation of a special group to study
the long-range effects of the gas.
   The Indian government is suing Carbide for $3 billion in
damages. The civil suit is still being heard in Bhopal, the state
capital.
   The government also has begun a criminal case against the
company, several of its subsidiaries and current and former company
officers.
   The Madhya Pradesh high court recently upheld an order by the
Bhopal civil judge, M.W. Deo, that Union Carbide pay $192 million
in interim relief to the gas victims.
   Robert D. Kennedy, chairman of Union Carbide, said Wednesday the
company has not yet decided whether to appeal the high court ruling.
   India contends that the gas leak was caused by negligence. The
company has said it resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled
employee.
   Efforts to reach an out-of-court settlement in the case failed
in November, although both sides agreed to continue talking.
According to sources close to the talks last year, Union Carbide
offered slightly more than $500 million to settle the case.
   About 540,000 people have filed claims for damages, and the
Indian government is sorting through them to determine which are
valid.
   The relief plan released Thursday calls for spending $110
million on medical relief; $1.7 million for economic
rehabilitation; $52.2 million for social work; and $65.7 million
for environmental improvements.
   Additional money would go to a disaster management institute and
the long-term medical study.
   The plan also sets aside $192,000 per year to be distributed as
financial aid to victim's families. The government pays a lump sum
of $770 for each death.

   Secret documents seized from Lt. Col. Oliver
L. North's office could expose ``people in very difficult
situations to torture and death'' in the Middle East if publicly
disclosed, the prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case said today.
   At a hearing on providing classified documents to the defense,
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh told U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell that some of the documents contain information so
sensitive that a person known to have seen it would be in endanger
by travel to the Middle East.
   ``There were documents found in Col. North's safe he shouldn't
have had'' under government security regulations, Walsh said
   The material included compilations of highly sensitive
information that is usually scattered in bits and pieces throughout
other documents.
   ``Why he had them I don't know,'' Walsh said.
   Gesell has ruled that the defense is entitled to see 300,000
pages of classified material collected by Walsh so that lawyers for
North and three co-defendants can determine if any of the documents
would help their case.
   Between 5 and 10 percent of the material is extremely sensitive,
and government security experts are concerned about releasing it
for inspection by at least one of North's co-defendants,
businessman Albert Hakim, Walsh said.
   ``As advocates we have no interest in this whatever,'' Walsh
said, indicating a rift with the Reagan administration over
disclosure.
   But government security experts are concerned about giving full
access to Hakim, a security consultant who deals with governments
in the Middle East and Asia, he said.
   ``I don't see why he would like to have in his possession that
type of information when he is traveling in the Middle East,''
Walsh said. ``He's put in jeopardy by that kind of information.''
   The restriction sought by government security officials would
also apply, at least temporarily, to retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard V. Secord, another defendant charged in the case, according
to court papers. Lawyers for Hakim and Secord, however, could see
the material.
   Walsh said the government had no objection to North and his
former boss, one-time national security adviser John M. Poindexter,
examining all the documents being placed in a secure facility for
defense lawyers to work with the material.
   ``Colonel North doesn't pose the problem because most of these
documents he's seen anyhow,'' Walsh said.
   North and his three co-defendants are charged with conspiring to
illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Gesell said resolving the issue might involve a month of secret
hearings.
   Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters today that the White House is ``cooperating in every
way'' and said ``we'll find a way to make everything available that
we can as long as it is approved by this (screening) procedure.''
   ``We intend to work with the court in the same way that we have
in the past,'' Fitzwater said, ``and I would just add that the
intelligence agencies' interagency committee that reviews the
security classifications has received 70,000 pages of documents
from the independent counsel. Forty-thousand pages have been
cleared for production to the defense without restriction.''
   The spokesman said ``we're operating very rapidly and we are
concerned about methods and sources being divulged to witnesses who
are not cleared to know those things. But this new procedure will
allow the courts and the independent counsel to make decisions on
any documents that are in dispute.''
   According to court papers filed this week by Hakim's lawyers,
the sensitive information the government seeks to protect includes
documents that would expose hostages in the Middle East to death if
released.
   Disclosure would also compromise U.S. intelligence gathering,
military planning and sensitive foreign policy initiatives,
according to a letter Walsh's office sent to the defense earlier
this week.
   On Wednesday, Gesell accused the Reagan administration of
intentionally withholding secret documents and threatened to
dismiss the charges if the material is not made available to the
defense.
   Walsh, ``so far as I know, is making every effort to produce the
documents,'' Gesell said.
   ``The responsibility lies with the attorney general and the
White House. I want to find out promptly what is taking place and
what is going to take place.''
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten denied there was any
deliberate foot-dragging in preparing the documents for defense
review.
   ``There is certainly no attempt being made to impede the process
in any way,'' Korten said. ``We're talking about a large volume of
material here that needs careful examination.''

   U.S. military experts surveying a
wartime crash site in Laos found no remains of Americans who may
have died there 22 years ago, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said
Thursday.
   But the spokesman, Ross Petzing, said Laotians and Americans
still will excavate the area, probably within the next few days.
   The American survey team returned to Bangkok on Tuesday after
inspecting the wreckage of an OV-1A Mohawk aicraft, which crashed
May 15, 1966, with two U.S. servicemen aboard, Petzing said.
   The spokesman said the families of the two, who have not been
identified, were notified of the survey results.
   The long-awaited excavation of the light aircraft will be the
third U.S.-Laotian search for remains of 555 Americans listed as
missing in action in Laos during the Vietnam War. The excavation is
to be carried out by 14 to 16 Americans in an area of eastern
Savannakhet province.
   The seven-man survey team was led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey,
commander of the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution
Center. The center is charged with resolving the fates of Americans
missing in foreign wars.
   Circumstances surrounding the downing of the aircraft were not
known, but several U.S. planes were shot down in eastern
Savannakhet while on missions to attack the Ho Chi Minh trail,
which the North Vietnamese communists used to bring men and
supplies into South Vietnam. North Vietnam defeated U.S.-backed
South Vietnam in 1975 after the United States withdrew.
   Previous joint excavations in Laos were held in 1985 and 1986.

   Singer Michael Jackson, visiting a
Texas cowboy boot factory, thought an experimental shoe-boot was a
real thriller.
   Jackson, in Dallas for a three-day stand at Reunion Arena this
week, stopped at the Justin Boot factory in Fort Worth Wednesday
with Spanky McFarland of ``Our Gang'' fame.
   Well-known as an animal lover, Jackson shunned the exotic
animal-skinned boots and selected three pairs off the rack, all in
basic black.
   Justin Boot executive Bill Edmondson said Jackson was
particularly taken with a display of an experimental model of a new
boot, which the company promised to send him.
   The bottom of the new model is on a standard cowboy-style form
with a pointed toe and sharply slanted heel. But the top only goes
up four inches.
   All told, Jackson picked up $1,000 worth of goods _ ``if we'd
made him pay for it,'' Edmondson said. ``He did offer.''

   An ad agency has persuaded rivals such as NBA

buddies.
   ``Become Buddies For Life'' is a Red Cross advertising campaign
aimed at increasing blood donations. The commercials, which will be
televised nationally come summer, were created by J. Walter
Thompson's Detroit's office and introduced at a Southeastern
Michigan American Red Cross meeting Wednesday.
   Thomas of the Detroit Pistons and Bird of the Boston Celtics

well-known adversaries who already have agreed to pair up are New
York Yankees Manager Billy Martin and Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner.
   Comedian Joan Rivers was eager to appear with Elizabeth Taylor
in a ``buddy'' ad, but Taylor cited schedule conflicts, said Blaise
Newman, a vice president at the ad agency.
   Talk show host Phil Donahue said no to an appearance with rival
Oprah Winfrey even though Winfrey was receptive to the idea, and
Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner wasn't willing to be a Red Cross
buddy to feminist Gloria Steinem.

   Jerry Lucas played on the U.S. Olympic
basketball team and was elected to the NBA Hall of Fame, but he
says he's having more fun pursuing his lifelong dream _ teaching
children how to remember.
   Lucas, in Omaha Wednesday on a promotional tour, has been in the
memory-training business since he wrote his first book on the
subject in 1974.
   He teaches memory in much the same way children learn things
before they go to school. It's a matter of creating mental images,
rather than the simple repetition of intangible words, he said.
   ``You see something, you identify it and you have a picture in
your mind. Once you have a picture, it's stored in your mind. You
don't lose it,'' Lucas said. ``There was nothing I found that could
not be made tangible, even differential calculus and other
formulas.''
   Lucas said he hopes memory training eventually will
revolutionize teaching in the United States. He said he is working
with the governors of Alabama and North Carolina to see about the
chances of implementing some of his methods in the classroom.

   Aboriginal activists Thursday slipped
through a navy dockyard and daubed Queen Elizabeth II's yacht
Britannia with a slogan protesting deaths of blacks in custody,
police said.
   The words ``End the killing time'' in nine-inch letters were
sprayed on the hull in red paint in reference to more than 100
aboriginal deaths in police custody being investigated by a royal

   At no time was Queen Elizabeth II in jeopardy. She spent the day

convicts, who were among the country's first European settlers.
   The queen is on a three-week tour for Australia's bicentennial

   The U.S. Energy Department says it will
ship a 55-ton drilling rig to the Soviet Union within the next two
weeks as part of a program between the two countries to monitor
each other's nuclear tests.
   DOE spokesman Chris West says a shaft drilled by Soviet
technicians at the Soviet test site does not meet U.S.
requirements. He said Wednesday the Soviets have agreed to allow
the United States to drill its own shaft.
   The U.S. is testing a monitoring system called CORRTEX at the
Soviet site. That system requires that a shaft be drilled alongside
the shaft containing the nuclear weapon. The CORRTEX shaft contains
monitoring equipment to determine the size of the blast.
   The Soviets have indicated they will use seismic equipment in
monitoring a U.S. test.
   The two sides are scheduled to monitor each other's tests
sometime this summer.
   Nearly two dozen American scientists, most of them from Nevada,
are at the Soviet test site making preparations to monitor the
Soviet blast. Seven Soviet scientists are at the Nevada Test Site,
65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, observing preparations for the
U.S. test.
   The DOE shipped 45 tons of monitoring equipment to the Soviet
Union aboard a giant C-5B aircraft two weeks ago.

   Alcohol and history apparently don't mix
in Plymouth.
   Bowing to outcries from local restaurateurs and a descendant of
Pilgrims, town officials have rejected a request to serve liquor at
the Plimoth Plantation historical site.
   ``I can hardly see how a pina colada goes with a 17th-century
dinner. My forefathers would have jumped over in their graves,''
said Karen Howland, a descendant of Pilgrims, before selectmen
Tuesday unanimously turned down the bid to serve alcohol at the
200-seat restaurant opened in October.
   Several restaurant owners told the board that approval of the
liquor license request would draw away patrons and clash with the
historical atmosphere of Plimoth Plantation, a re-creation of the
Pilgrim's early 17th-century settlement.
   ``They come in here under the guise of being a historical and
educational enterprise, and they want to have liquor and compete
with us,'' said George White, whose wife owns the 1620 Restaurant
in Plymouth.
   But Plimoth Plantation director David Case said a liquor license
would help attract conventions and large functions at a time when
government aid for museums is dwindling.
   ``This is one of the few resources we have to pay the freight,''
said Case.
   Richard Ehrlich, the plantation's assistant director, said the
restaurant will continue to operate without a liquor license but
may later apply for a permit to serve beer and wine.

   A man afraid that he would lose his job at a
hospital because of state cuts died Thursday after shooting himself
at a service station owned by the town's police chief.
   ``He just drove up and sent word that he was going to shoot
himself,'' said Chief E.S. ``Buggs'' Barnes. ``He told one of my
attendants, `Tell Buggs I'm going to kill myself.'''
   He said Roger Crum, a nursing assistant at Villa Feliciana
Chronic Disease Hospital and Rehabilitation Center since August
1986, shot himself in the head as he sat in his car Wednesday
afternoon.
   The windows were rolled up, the doors locked, and Crum was
holding a .22-caliber pistol to his temple.
   ``I tried to open the door and as I was walking around the other
side to see if that door was locked, to try and talk to him, he
pulled the trigger,'' Barnes said.
   Crum died Thursday morning in a Baton Rouge hospital.
   Crum, 31, was married last month and had been very likely to
lose his job in the massive layoffs of state employees caused by
the state's financial situation, said administrator Jack London.
   London said Crum ``wasn't the first casualty of this thing.''
About a month ago when rumors were circulating that Gov. Buddy
Roemer would shut down Villa, an older man died of a heart attack,
he said.

<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan is favored to defeat
four opponents, including an ex-Ku Klux Klansman, in Tuesday's
Democratic gubernatorial primary but faces a tough battle to unseat
popular Republican Gov. Jim Martin this fall.
   Martin, hoping to become the first Republican governor of North
Carolina this century to serve consecutive terms, is unopposed for
the GOP nomination.
   Turnout likely will be lower than normal because of the absence
of a closely contested gubernatorial primary and because North
Carolina had a separate presidential primary March 8 as part of
Super Tuesday, observers say.
   The candidates have campaigned vigorously but the public seems
to have paid little attention. In several polls, more than 50
percent of those surveyed did not know enough about the contenders
for lieutenant governor to choose a favorite.
   The biggest draw Tuesday could be the race for lieutenant
governor. With Jordan forgoing a re-election bid to challenge
Martin, five Democrats and three Republicans are running for the
state's second-ranking office.
   Jordan's four opponents include Billy Martin, a service-station
employee not related to the governor; Bruce Friedman, an
anti-nuclear activist from Sylva; Carroll W. Crawford of Mount
Ulla, who said he quit the Klan in 1987 but remains sympathetic to
some of its causes; and James T. Lloyd of Salisbury. All are
political unknowns and none has waged a visible campaign.
   Jordan has urged his supporters not to be complacent. ``Strange
things can happen when turnout is low,'' he said. ``This is an
opportunity to test our organization.''
   But his campaign activities have been geared toward the general
election.
   Jordan has put forward major policy initiatives on economic
development and school dropout prevention, including a
controversial plan to withhold driver's licenses from minors who
quit school. He has attacked Martin as a governor who has done
little of substance and has tried to take credit for Democrats'
accomplishments.
   ``North Carolina doesn't need a governor who is content to be a
passenger or a back-seat driver,'' Jordan said in January after
driving an 18-wheel truck from his family lumberyard in Mount
Gilead to Raleigh to dramatize his ``hands-on'' management style.
   Martin, a former six-term congressman and Davidson College
chemistry professor, has pointed to glowing economic statistics
during his term and questioned Jordan's leadership skills.
   ``In my first three years, over 300,000 new jobs have come into
North Carolina _ jobs from poultry to high tech,'' Martin said in a
campaign television commercial aired in March.
   Newspaper polls since January have shown Martin with leads
ranging from 16 to 30 percentage points. Jordan has questioned
those findings and Martin says the race will tighten as Jordan's
name recognition improves.
   Jordan committed what observers called a potentially serious
gaffe in March, telling black newspaper executives he agreed with
them on some issues that he wouldn't discuss publicly because he
could not win ``without the white redneck vote in eastern North
Carolina.''
   Martin described the remark as ``something Jimmy the Greek might
say,'' a reference to the former television sports commentator
fired after making controversial remarks about black athletes.
   Jordan said he hadn't meant to be derogatory and considered
himself a redneck.

<HEAD>Strikes In Poland Pose New Challenge To Gorbachev</HEAD>

   Strikes in Poland pose a new challenge to
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev just as he seeks to ease
East-West tension by declaring that he will withdraw from
Afghanistan and loosen controls in Eastern Europe.
   Gorbachev is counting on better relations with the West to give
him breathing space for badly needed economic reforms in the Soviet
Union.
   A new Polish crisis would pose a dilemma for him.
   If Gorbachev is perceived in the West as backing violent
suppression of strikes in Poland, it could spoil the mood at the
summit meeting with President Reagan in Moscow on May 29-June 2.
   If unrest in Poland gets out of hand, as it did in 1956, 1968,
1970, 1976 and 1980-81, Gorbachev may come under renewed pressure
from Kremlin hardliners who oppose his efforts to ease
international tensions and carry out economic reforms at home.
   ``The last thing that the Soviets want, particularly as they
withdraw from Afghanistan, is the specter of national revolt in
Poland. It could cast them as imperial,'' said Janusz Bugajski, an
expert on Poland at the Center for International and Strategic
Studies in Washington.
   The Polish unrest is not yet as serious as the demonstrations
that wracked Soviet Armenia and Azerbaijan earlier this year, said
a State Department analyst. And the situation is not as serious as
it was in August 1980, when nationwide strikes forced Poland's
communist authorities to bargain with the independent Solidarity
trade union.
   But ``the situation is really developing pretty fast,'' said the
State Department analyst, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified.
   And the Polish government spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said he would
not be surprised if the labor unrest spreads.
   The Reagan administration has not publicly commented on the
latest Polish unrest, although historically it has been an
explosive issue for Reagan. He reacted harshly to the military
crackdown in 1981, imposing economic sanctions.
   Reagan took the sanctions off after Poland's communist
authorities released political prisoners in 1986, and this spring
the two nations exchanged ambassadors for the first time since
martial law.
   The Polish leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, has been trying to
carry his own brand of economic reforms, including reduced
subsidies on food and other necessities.
   But the reforms were economically painful for a nation which for
a decade has suffered shortages of meat and other necessities. The
workers responded with wage demands, and in some cases where those
demands were not met, with strikes.
   Solidarity, although outlawed since October 1982, still exists
as a nationwide organization, with regional and factory chapters.
   Lech Walesa, the Solidarity chairman, issued a statement
Wednesday urging Poles to ``put pressure on the authorities'' and
called for the restoration of his union's legal status.
   So far, Jaruzelski has balked at restoring Solidarity or other
opposition demands.
   It was Jaruzelski, a Soviet-trained career military officer, who
crushed Solidarity in the most recent demonstration of the
so-called ``Brezhnev doctrine.'' That policy, named after the late
Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, held that the Soviet Union would
intervene with force if a client state showed signs of abandoning
socialism.
   Gorbachev hinted last year that he was backing away from the
doctrine, and issued a statement in Yugoslavia on March 18 saying
that Eastern European nations are free to follow ``any paths to
socialism.''
   His statements are viewed as part of a wider Kremlin campaign to
reduce tensions with the West, a step which U.S. analysts view as a
necessary prerequisite to diverting resources from the military to
the civilian sector.
   Gorbachev apparently has the upper hand over more conservative
members of his own Politburo, led by Egor Ligachev. But unrest in
Poland could tip the balance and imperil the reforms.
   In 1956, reforms by Kremlin leader Nikita Khrushchev promoted
revolts in Poland and Hungary, which in turn led to an unsuccessful
attempt to depose him in 1957.
   Kremlin conservatives managed to dump Khrushchev seven years
later, and halted his fight against the legacy of Josef Stalin, a
battle which is at the center of Gorbachev's own reform drive.
   The Poles, too, are students of history, and they can be
expected to take to the streets in large numbers next week to
celebrate May 1, the international workers' day, and May 3, the
anniversary of Poland's constitution of 1791.
   Solidarity and its backers traditionally use those anniversaries
to stage massive demonstrations of opposition to the communist
government.

<HEAD>CBS Postpones Fall Season Because of Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   CBS, citing the writers strike and the
possibility of a strike by craft workers, said today it would
postpone the opening of its fall television season until at least
the end of October.
   CBS, third in the Nielsen ratings for the first time in its
history, had planned to begin new fall programming on Sept. 5. That
would have given it an earlier start than NBC, which took first
place in the season just completed, and second-place ABC.
   Notice of the postponement was sent to CBS affiliate stations by
Thomas F. Leahy, president of the CBS Television Network.
   ``Gene Jankowski (president of the CBS Broadcast Group) stated
today that, given the continuing strike by the Writer's Guild of
America and the uncertainty over the IATSE@Teamsters negotiations
in the film industry this summer, the previously announced Sept. 5
start date for the 1988-89 season is no longer feasible,'' Leahy
said in the statement.
   ``We are looking forward to a new season start date at the end
of October 1988. Further details and an exact start date will be
forthcoming,'' the statement said.
   The writers struck the film and television industry on March 7.
There are no negotiations at this time.
   IATSE, the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage
Employes, represents the various crafts in the film industry, from
stage hands to cameramen to makeup artists.
   ABC will not announce its fall season start date until it
reveals its new schedule on May 23, said a network spokesman.
   Brandon Stoddard, president of ABC Entertainment, said during a
news conference on April 18 that he did not know when the season
would begin.
   ``Our schedule is okay so far,'' said NBC spokesman Jay
Michelis. ``But it will all depend on how long the strike lasts. We
will announce our fall schedule on May 18.''
   NBC has an advantage because it will telecast the Summer
Olympics from Korea from Sept. 16 to Oct. 3. It will also telecast
the World Series in late October.
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC, has said that for all
intents and purposes NBC would not begin its fall schedule until
after the World Series.
   A strike by movie and television actors in 1980 caused a delay
in the opening of that year's television season for all three
networks.

<HEAD>Court Rules Bayh Eligible To Be Governor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Indiana Supreme Court ruled Thursday
that Secretary of State Evan Bayh meets the residency requirement
for governor, clearing the way for him to run in next week's
Democratic primary.
   In a unanimous decision, the court upheld an earlier Shelby
Circuit Court ruling that Bayh did not lose his Hoosier residency
when he lived in Washington in 1983 and 1984. The state
Constitution requires that candidates for governor must have lived
in Indiana for the five years preceding the election.
   The five justices concluded that Bayh always intended to return
to his home state.
   Bayh, the 32-year-old son of former Sen. Birch E. Bayh, has been
the leader in public opinion polls matching him against his
opponent, former Kokomo Mayor Stephen J. Daily, in next Tuesday's
primary. He also leads in polls against Republican Lt. Gov. John M.
Mutz, who is unopposed for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. The
GOP has controlled the Indiana governorship for 20 years.
   The legal battle over Bayh's residency was triggered when
Republican Gov. Robert D. Orr instructed the GOP-controlled State
Election Board to consider Bayh's eligibility to hold the
governor's office. Orr is barred by state law from seeking a third
term.
   Bayh filed a lawsuit the next day seeking a ruling affirming his
eligibility. He said he filed the suit because he feared he
couldn't get a fair ruling from the election board, which has one
Democratic and two Republican members.
   The election board dropped its inquiry after a trial was
scheduled quickly on Bayh's lawsuit.

   The bullet that killed a police sergeant during
a drug raid came from another officer's gun and was not fired by
the pregnant woman who initially had been accused, a police source
said today.
   The woman was wounded during the shooting Wednesday, went into
labor and gave birth to a daughter, officials said.
   Police originally said the woman had killed Sgt. John F.
McCormick while trying to shoot her way out of a cocaine den, but
the police source, who declined to be identified, said ``ballistic
tests indicate that the type of gun fired was not consistent with
her gun, but consistent with ours.''
   The source said the ballistic tests were conducted on a bullet
that was retrieved during an autopsy on McCormick.
   Wednesday's slaying was the third drug-related killing of a
police officer in two months and had prompted renewed calls from
Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward and Mayor Edward I. Koch for the
death penalty for cop killers.
   ``She shot a cop. She knew she was shooting at a cop. And she
killed a cop. As far as I'm concerned, she should be taken out and
executed. I don't care whether it's a deterrent. ... Kill them all
and let God sort them out,'' Ward said.
   McCormick, 43, of the Bronx Narcotics Unit, was shot once in the
face while serving a search warrant at an upper Manhattan apartment
where police believed 4{ pounds of cocaine was being held, said
Ward.
   Mercedes Perez, the woman accused of shooting him, was shot
twice and taken to the same hospital, where it was discovered she
was eight months pregnant. She went into labor and delivered a
5-pound, 1-ounce girl, authorities said.
   Mother and daughter were in satisfactory condition, offiials
said.
   Police raiders at the apartment where Ms. Perez lived found
scales, four vials of crack, one marijuana cigarette, a half ounce
of white powder believed to be cocaine, $2,000 cash, and a pit bull
terrier in the kitchen, authorities said.
   According to the account given by the police source, two other
police officers were in a back bedroom struggling with Ms. Perez
when her gun went off. They exchanged gunfire with her and one of
those bullets struck McCormick, the source said.
   On April 13, Housing Authority police officer Anthony McLean,
27, was shot to death while searching for a missing child in a
Brooklyn housing project. It is believed that he inadvertently
interrupted a drug dispute.
   On Feb. 26, city policeman Edward Byrne was killed while he sat
in his cruiser guarding the home of a witness in a narcotics case
in Queens.
   Last year, four police officers were killed in the line of duty
and seven were injured. The officer who died Wednesday was the
first police sergeant to die in the line of duty in 13 years.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of emaciated young men
and boys fleeing Sudan's civil war are flowing monthly into
Ethiopia refugee camps that already shelter 250,000 Sudanese, U.N.
officials said Thursday.
   Many of the refugees who walk up to four months to reach the
camps carry little or no food, and they barely are surviving when
they arrive, said Wairimu Karago, a U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees representative in Ethiopia.
   ``When they come in the camps they're not even able to stand,''
said Ayodele Fowler, head of the Ethiopia desk in the commission's
office in Geneva. ``They're walking skeletons.''
   The commission estimates 20 percent of the refugees die en route.
   ``Only the strongest survive the trip,'' said Miss Karago.
   Hundreds more die in the camps, but the death rate is down to
about one third of its peak of three deaths per every 10,000 people
per day of several months ago when emergency supplies could not
meet the sudden influx.
   The camps are in a remote area of western Ethiopia. All but one
are accessible by road, but it takes trucks carrying relief
supplies six days to make the trip from the northeastern Red Sea
port of Assab.
   Although Miss Karago said the U.N. group tried to call attention
to the crisis last year, it was overshadowed by a massive drought
relief effort aimed at saving the lives of 7 million
starvation-threatened people.
   The situation is complicated by Ethiopia's preoccupation with a
civil war in the north, which has crippled relief operations.
   Fowler said there is a critical need for more trucks to carry
food and suplies to the camps.
   The refugees' basic food needs, mostly in the form of grain,
would largely be covered by a U.N. World Food Program donation of
$8 million in grain announced Wednesday, he said.
   Nevertheless, Fowler appealed for another 32,000 metric tons of
supplemental and therapeutic food. Many of the refugees eat nothing
but acacia tree leaves during their treks.
   A Western diplomat who visited the Itang and Fugnido camps in
March said some of the worst-off refugees ``compared poorly with
pictures of Nazi concentration camp victims and were as bad or
worse as anything seen in Ethiopia during the 1984-86 famine.''
   Tubercular coughs sounded throughout Fugnido's in-patient
medical unit where four or five of the refugees ``looked as if they
would not survive the day, and only one was observed moving slowly
crawling in his naked state towards a water jug,'' said the
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Since November, 8,000 to 10,000 refugees have been arriving each
month and swelling populations at a camp in Itang and forcing the
creation of camps at Dimma, Fugnido, and Assosa.
   The refugees are primarily 10- to 15-year old Dinka and Nuer
tribesmen who say they are fleeing conscription and atrocities in
southern Sudan where mainly Christian and animist rebels are
fighting the Moslem government.
   Their most common tale is of government troops entering villages
and killing the men and boys and raping the women and girls before
taking them for sale into slavery, according to officials who have
visited the camps.
   The young women and boys arriving at the camps either have
escaped the attack or fled before the onslaught.
   The current movement of displaced Sudanese into Ethiopia bagan
in 1983 when the rebels took up arms against the government
following the collapse of a peace agreement. However, people have
been fleeing periodic conflicts in southern Sudan since the 1950s.

<TEXT>
   Althea Gibson, the first black American tennis
champion, Thursday presented her five Wimbledon trophies to the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.
   ``Who could have imagined? Who could have thought?'' the
60-year-old Gibson said at Smithsonian ceremony. ``Here stands
before you a Negro woman, raised in Harlem, who went on to become a
tennis player ... and finally wind up being a world champion, in
fact, the first black woman champion of this world.
   ``And believe it or not, I still am,'' she said.
   The eldest of five children, Gibson described herself as ``a
born athlete,'' noting her 200 bowling average and membership in
the Mysterious Five girls' basketball team before she met Fred
Johnson, the one-armed tennis coach who taught her to play.
   Among those attending the presentation was Dr. E.A. Eaton of
Wilmington, N.C., who with another black physician decided to
prepare the gangly, 17-year-old Harlem teen for the world of tennis
whites and rackets.
   ``She was a fine player but she had too many rough edges to go
into those tennis clubs,'' Eaton remembered. ``So my friend said if
I would send her to school, he would take her to the tournaments. A
few months later, Althea got off the train in Wilmington, with her
bag, tennis racket and the saxaphone Suger Ray Robinson had given
her.''
   Although Gibson was the first black woman to compete in the U.S.
championships at Forrest Hills, N.Y., in 1950 and at Wimbledon in
1951, it was not until 1956 that she began to win major tennis
tournaments throughout Europe, including the women's doubles
championship at Wimbledon.
   For the next two years Gibson captured both the singles and
doubles championships at Wimbledon, causing her to be voted the
Woman Athlete of the Year for 1957 by The Associated Press. During
this period she also was awarded the Banchees Award of
Sportsmanship, the Babe Zaharias Award as Woman Athlete of the Year
and the Pigskin Club Sterling Athlete Award.
   Although the trophies will be held in storage, a Harry C. Lee
tennis racket and a tennis dress she used in one of her
championship matches were placed on public view immediately.
   Following her retirement in 1960, Gibson toured with the Harlem
Globetrotters, served on the New Jersey Athletic Commission and
became a professional golfer. She currently is special assistant to
the New Jersey commissioner of community affairs working with youth
in athletic programs.

   Kevin Ricupero expressed his unhappiness
with town officials by painting his post office building purple,
yellow, black and fluorescent red and orange. He also threw in a
few pink polka dots.
   ``I like these colors. These are my favorite colors,'' Ricupero
said.
   Others are not so enamored.
   Selectman Erving LeCain called it ``one of the stupidest things
I've seen in a long time.'' Postmistress Lorraine Tucker said she
would be happier ``in a little post office not noticeable so much.''
   Ricupero, 34, said he wanted to rehabilitate the entire
building, expand it to house his office, redo the sidewalk and
landscape the front. But the town rejected his petition for an
addition, saying there was an inadequate setback.
   The zoning board of adjustment suggested he put the addition in
the back. However, after drawing up another plan, Ricupero was
again rejected, this time because there was not enough parking.
   Ricupero said he was rejected because he moved to Bennington
from Massachusetts five years ago and is considered a
``flatlander.''
   John Cronin III, chairman of the zoning board and also a
Massachusetts native, called Ricupero a ``troublemaker,'' and
suggested he hire an engineer to address problems with the plan.

   The Rev. Charles West believes in modern
means of delivering his church's message.
   For more than a month, members of the First Baptist Church have
been hearing West remind them to attend choir practice and show up
for parish meetings.
   The preaching comes via a telecomputer, a machine programmed to
dial phone numbers and deliver West's message of the day.
   ``One person can't make the calls this machine does in the same
time frame,'' West said. ``It takes no breaks for lunch or a drink
of water. If somebody hangs up, it doesn't get mad.''
   On the day before Easter, for example, all 525 church members
picked up the ringing phone and heard this: ``Hello, this is Pastor
West calling. I trust you're ready for Easter. Don't forget to turn
your clocks up.''
   It also gave other information about church services and had
room for parishioners to leave a message.
   West conceded that a taped message sounds impersonal, but said
it's a good way to keep in touch with his growing congregation.

   Town Manager Peggy Morgan is known for
her practical jokes. She's tied flowers on trees before they bloom
and filled people's beds with cracker crumbs.
   Her victims got their revenge Wednesday when a ton of manure was
delivered to her by fire trucks with their sirens wailing.
   Morgan's name was chosen from those of more than 200 others who
were nominated for the dubious prize in a radio station's contest.
   The smelly gift was neatly packaged in 50 bags. Morgan had the
manure delivered to her home, while her friends speculated that she
was already plotting her next gag.
   ``I do believe in sharing, and my friends will be taken care
of,'' said Morgan.

<BYLINE>If Iranian Missiles Were't Silkworms, What Were They?
^By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon said the missiles Iran fired
at three U.S. warships last week were not Chinese-made Silkworms,
but left unanswered a question that puzzles American officers here:
If not Silkworms, what were they?
   Senior naval officers said they were unaware of anything in
Iran's arsenal that might be easily confused with the Silkworm, a
dangerous but fairly primitive weapon based on a 30-year-old Soviet
design.
   ``If they have something new and different, you would expect it
to be better,'' one said, noting that the projectiles were thwarted
with relative ease by the warships' anti-missile defenses. Four
fell into the water and the fifth was seen to hit an oil platform.
   Iran deployed mobile Silkworm batteries along its shore of the
Strait of Hormuz about a year ago. It threatened to fire them at
ships in the narrow gateway to the Persian Gulf, but never had rom
warships or aircraft.
   One clue being examined was an Iranian C-130 aircraft that was
airborne at the time. American officers suspect it reported
locations of U.S. ships to missile batteries.
   Some diplomats and officers said they believed Washington would
play down or deny the firing of Silkworms to avoid the need for
retaliation that might escalate conflict in the gulf, where Iran
and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   ``That's what I think and that's what a lot of other people
think,'' a Western diplomat said. He noted a U.S. warning to Iran
last year that even an indication of ``hostile intent'' would draw
swift response.
   U.S. officials including Caspar Weinberger, then defense
secretary, said such intent would include using the missile
batteries' fire-control radar to track Navy ships or other
U.S.-flagged vessels passing through Hormuz.
   Some Arab leaders are understood to believe the United States,
having dealt a severe blow to Iran's naval forces in the clashes
April 18, wants to avoid further armed conflict.
   American forces attacked two Iranian oil platforms and sank or
disabled six naval craft that day in raids described as a
``measured response'' to hostile acts, including the mining of gulf
waters and firing on U.S. helicopters.
   In the course of ``Operation Praying Mantis,'' as the
retaliatory raids were called, the guided missile frigate Jack
Williams, destroyer O'Brien and guided missile destroyer Joseph
Strauss came under missile attack near the strait.
   They took evasive action and fired ``chaff'' rockets to confuse
the radar-guidance systems of the incoming projectiles, all of
which flew wide.
   One missile was seen by crewmen on the Jack Williams fantail as
it crossed behind the ship and hit a distant oil platform. It
passed close enough that a helicopter pilot dived into a net for
safety and a crewman fired at it with an M-60 machine gun.
   Officers of the Jack Williams identified the missiles as
Silkworms, but Pentagon officials said Wednesday they concluded
from ``strong indicators'' that they were not. They said the
inquiry was continuing.
   Officials did not describe the ``indicators,'' but one said
known Silkworm sites and a storage area at the Bandar Abbas naval
base were under ``constant surveillance'' and ``if they had moved
one out, we would have seen it.''
   A Navy spokesman in Manama said he could not comment on the
Pentagon findings. ``That gets into an area we can't discuss
here,'' he said.
   The report from Washington was no surprise to Navy officers in
the gulf. Some had said they were stunned and mystified by the
efforts of officials in Washington, within hours, to debunk the
reports of Silkworms.
   ``Everything we know says that's what they were,'' a senior
officer said at the time. Another declared angrily: ``I know
Silkworms were fired just as well as I know my own name.''
   After hearing that Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, was quoted by a congressman _ misquoted, it turned
out _ as denying the missiles were Silkworms, one officer pointed
to the rank on his collar and laughed.
   ``See that?'' he said. ``Do you think I'm going to argue?''
   Capt. Donald A. Dyer, commander of Surface Action Group Delta,
the three-ship unit led by the Jack Williams, was asked again the
day after the missile was fired what kind he thought it was.
   ``I don't know,'' he said with a shrug. ``All I know is, it was
big, it was fast and it came from Iran.''

<HEAD>Outcry Against Gun Law Follows Shooting of Third Miami Cop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shooting of three Miami policeman in a month,
along with a skyrocketing murder rate, had authorities here
demanding a change in Florida's liberal gun law Thursday, and the
state Legislature appears to be responding.
   Only hours after Miami motorcycle patrolman James Hayden was
wounded twice with an automatic pistol during a routine traffic
stop, a state House criminal justice subcommittee voted 4-3
Thursday to recommend an amendment to the state constitution to
require a seven-day cooling-off period for gun buyers.
   On Wednesday, the full Senate had approved another bill that
tightened up gun law loopholes allowing some convicted criminals to
get concealed weapons permits.
   The current relaxed gun law, approved last year over the
protests of urban police agencies, all but eliminated cooling-off
periods, banned local gun control ordinances and allowed most
Floridians to carry a concealed weapon.
   Opponents, including Miami-area police and city officials, say
it encourages a Wild West atmosphere they blame for a surge in
violence.
   ``You liberalize gun laws and people feel they are at liberty to
go out and shoot each other and shoot policemen,'' an angry Miami
police Sgt. David Rivero said Thursday. ``We're headed the wrong
way.''
   Miami had an 18 percent increase in gun-related crimes between
October and March, compared with the same period before the law was
passed. And ominously, gun thefts were up 30 percent, said Rivero.
   The murder rate in Dade County, after having dropped last year,
has soared again, hitting the 100 mark in April _ four months ahead
of the 1987 rate.
   ``We're going to have to see a lot more people killed and maybe
a lot more policemen killed before the Legislature makes a
change,'' said Metro-Dade police spokesman Al Hidalgo-Gato.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez on Thursday called for a new law or a
state constitutional amendment giving local communities the right
to regulate guns.
   ``We need extensive background checks and a cooling-off
period,'' said Suarez. Under the current state law, counties can
impose a limited two-day cooling-off period, but police say it's so
vague that it's meaningless.
   Wednesday night's wounding of Hayden, who was listed in stable
condition Thursday, occurred in the same neighborhood where veteran
police officer Victor Estefan was shot to death March 30 after
stopping a car. There have been no arrests in either shooting.
   The same day Estefan was killed, a Florida Highway Patrol
trooper was wounded on Interstate 95 in Dade County and killed his
attacker. On April 5, a Miami undercover police officer was grazed
in the head by a gunman later identified as an escaped prisoner.
   If the bill passed Thursday by the criminal justice subcommittee
is later approved by the full House and the Senate, the question
will be put to voters on the November statewide ballot. The measure
would not need approval by Gov. Bob Martinez to be placed on the
ballot.
   House Majority Leader Ron Silver, a Democrat from North Miami
Beach, sponsored the proposed constitutional amendment because he
said Florida's image has been tarnished by the gun law.
   ``I've traveled across this county,'' said Silver. ``No longer
are people asking us about the sun, beaches and weather ... but
they are talking about `What are you doing about the gun situation
in Florida?'''
   Marion Hammer, a lobbyist for the Florida arm of the National
Rifle Association, said Silver's bill was prompted more by
emotionalism than by a need to protect public safety.
   ``Waiting periods have nothing to do with fun and sun in
Florida,'' said Hammer, director of the Unified Sportsmen of
Florida.
   Police concede that none of the recent police shootings and few
other gun-related slayings can be tied directly to last year's gun
law. But they contend the law has put more guns on the street and
created a mentality that makes using a gun more acceptable.

<HEAD>Democrats Appeal to Reagan to Sign Bill; White House Says No</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders of Congress urged President
Reagan on Thursday to reverse course and sign a sweeping trade
bill, but the White House said flatly that he will veto it.
   Reagan's opposition to the bill centers on a provision requiring
companies to give workers 60 days' notice of plant closings or
major layoffs, and he offered his labor-leader background as a
reason.
   ``As an old labor union president, I suggest that's a matter
that belongs in the management-labor contracts between the unions
and the people,'' the president told reporters as he greeted
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for lunch.
   Reagan served as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1947
to 1952 and in 1959.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president's veto
message would ``clearly indicate'' what would be acceptable to the
administration in a replacement bill.
   ``We would hope then to be able to work with the leadership,
come up with a bill as rapidly as possible that everyone could
support and pass,'' Fitzwater said.
   However, Democrats said Reagan should sign the existing bill and
suggested there might not be enough time to produce another measure.
   ``This bill isn't dead yet,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters on Capitol Hill. ``The ball is in the
White House court. If there is a demise of this bill it will occur
at the White House, not here.''
   Byrd said the Senate has only about 90 legislative days left
this year and a heavy schedule. Asked if it would accept changes
drafted by the White House, he said, ``We're not spoon-fed from the
White House.''
   ``I hope the president will rethink his position and come down
on the side of the American people,'' Byrd said.
   Also pleading for Reagan to sign the bill, House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, said, ``There has to be a warm side to the
president. I can't believe it falls on deaf ears or a flinty
heart.''
   The measure, the product of three years of congressional work,
won final approval on a 63-36 Senate vote Wednesday, but the total
fell short of the two-thirds margin needed to override a veto.
   Besides the plant-closing provision, the lengthy bill would
increase the power of the U.S. trade representative to act against
other countries that use unfair trade practices, make it easier to
curb imports, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies, and
increase agricultural subsidies.
   The Japanese and South Korean governments urged Reagan to veto
the measure, saying it would hinder international trade. The
European Economic Community warned of retaliatory action if the
bill became law.
   Fitzwater said the bill is not expected to reach the Oval Office
until the middle of next week, after which Reagan will have 10 days
in which to act.
   ``In the veto message the president will lay out his generic
concerns about the bill, undoubtedly will specify that we would
like to see plant closings eliminated from future consideration of
a bill,'' the spokesman said.
   ``He will have a message that will ... pretty clearly indicate
what would be acceptable to the administration and use that as a
framework for then discussing a new bill with the leadership'' of
Congress.
   While the plant-closing provision had been the most
objectionable feature to the administration, Fitzwater said the
White House had other problems with it. He refused to spell out
what other changes the administration would demand to make the bill
acceptable, however.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said, ``There are a
lot of good things in that legislation, so if a couple of necessary
corrections are made and the bill comes back, I'm really quite
confident the president would sign it.''

   Jesse Jackson narrowly won Vermont's
presidential caucuses, according to official Democratic Party
figures released Thursday.
   Jackson edged Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis by winning 596
of the state convention delegates elected at local caucuses last
week. Dukakis won 582 delegates, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. won six and
120 were elected uncommitted.
   The percentages were 46 percent for Jackson to 45 percent for
Dukakis.
   Craig Fuller, the executive director of the state Democratic
Party, said the official tabulation had been slowed by mistakes
found in some community caucuses. An unofficial Associated Press
count on the night of the caucuses had Jackson ahead, 589 delegates
to 581 for Dukakis.
   The 1,304 delegates elected April 19 will attend the state
Democratic Party convention next month at which time 14 of the
state's 19 delegates to the national convention will be elected.
The remaining five spots belong to Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a Dukakis
supporter, and four party officials.
   It is not sure how the 14 will be split since the vote at the
state convention is by secret ballot.
   ``Fifty people going one way or the other could make a real
difference in whether it is 7-7 or 9-5,'' said Ron Squires of
Brattleboro, the vice chair of the party.
   Squires, one of the four party officials automatically a
delegate to the national convention, remains committed to Sen. Paul
Simon of Illinois, though he said Thursday that ``outside of that
commitment, the message Jackson has been delivering is the one I am
most comfortable with.''
   The other three party officials going to the national convention
are state party chair Violet Coffin, who is officially uncommitted
but listed by the Dukakis campaign as a likely supporter; state
committeeman John Carnahan, a Dukakis supporter, and Ellen
David-Freidman, a Jackson supporter.
   ``In Vermont, more than in any other state, white people did not
hesitate to vote for Jesse Jackson,'' Liz Blum, the Jackson state
coordinator, said Thursday after the official caucus results were
released.
   Dukakis had won Vermont's non-binding presidential primary on
March 1, taking 56 percent of the vote, while Jackson gained 26
percent.
   William Wasserman, the Dukakis coordinator, said of Jackson's
forces in the caucuses, ``They organized in the smallest of
communities, as well as the larger ones. That showed real
persistence, real dedication to detail.''

<HEAD>Bid To Topple Opposition Leader Bumps Mulroney From Headlines</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney must be wondering
what he has to do to grab a headline. His Washington summit took
second-billing at home Thursday to a dramatic rebellion in the
opposition Liberal Party.
   While Mulroney was urging Congress to curb acid rain in a speech
Sen. Daniel Moynihan termed the best he'd heard from a foreign
leader, newscasts in Canada led with Liberal leader John Turner's
fight for survival.
   A silver-haired lawyer who took over from former Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau in 1984 but has never had wholehearted support,
Turner emerged Wednesday from a day-long battle with detractors to
reject demands for his resignation.
   A group of 22 of the party's 39 members of Parliament had urged
him to step down as the country heads into an election campaign.
   ``I will stay as long as it takes to become prime minister,''
said a defiant Turner, 58.
   Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative, may have been miffed at
coming second on the news, but the outcome of the Liberal squabble
could help him in the election he must call in the next year. Polls
indicate that former Trudeau cabinet member Jean Chretien, waiting
in the Liberal wings, is twice as popular as Turner.
   The Conservatives, Liberals and socialist New Democratic Party
are running neck-and-neck in the polls, with Mulroney's party on
the upswing.
   There was more political turmoil in the headlines from Manitoba
Province, where the country's only socialist government was
resoundingly defeated Tuesday but none of the three main parties
won a majority.
   The Conservatives, led by premier-elect Gary Filmon, took 25 of
the 57 seats in the provincial legislature and will form a minority
government May 9. But Mulroney's party had hoped for a more
convincing win to start a national trend, and the big winners
Tuesday were the Liberals who took 20 seats and hold the balance of
power.
   Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs, a former Winnipeg teacher,
became the only woman opposition leader in Canada and is poised to
become the country's first woman premier if the Conservatives
falter.
   The result appeared to doom one of the biggest achievements of
Mulroney's first term: the Meech Lake constitutional accord he
negotiated with all 10 provinces last year.
   The accord would bring Quebec back into the constitutional fold,
ending a seven-year boycott, by recognizing the French-majority
province as a ``distinct society.''
   But Mulroney paid a price for that historic clause. He agreed to
decentralize federal powers, giving the provinces more say over
spending programs and appointments to the Supreme Court and Senate.
   Without consulting all party factions, Turner endorsed the
accord. But many leading Liberals oppose it, including Carstairs
and Trudeau, who emerged from retirement to argue passionately that
it could fracture the nation.
   Last year, 11 Liberal lawmakers defied Turner and voted against
the accord in Parliament. Last week, the Liberal-dominated Senate
refused to ratify the measure and sent it back to the House of
Commons with nine amendments.
   The accord also requires ratification by all provinces, and so
far only three have done so. New Brunswick is firmly against it,
and Manitoba premier-elect Filmon lacks the votes to push it
through.
   ``In essence, Meech Lake is dead,'' said Carstairs.
   Turner withstood a similar political ambush in 1986, emerging
with a 76 percent approval rating from a national convention, but
the unrest surfaced against last summer and this year.
   He told reporters his mandate came from the entire party, not
just members of Parliament, and he intends to fulfil it.
   Sheila Finestone, a Liberal lawmaker from Montreal, termed the
resentment against Turner a ``festering sore'' that had to be
thrashed out, but she hoped members would now rally behind him.
   However, there was speculation that some of the rebels who are
upset over Meech Lake and the party's $4 million debt may quit the
Liberal caucus to sit in Parliament as independents.
   ``Obviously, it will be very dificult to work together,'' said
one dissident, John Nunziata of Toronto.
   Defections could endanger Turner's position as official
opposition leader since the Liberals have 39 seats in Parliament
and the New Democrats 33. If seven Liberals resign, New Democratic
Party leader Ed Broadbent would take over Turner's role.

   When Paul J. Germano was trapped in his
burning car on a New Jersey highway, private detective James C.
Alvine III and two other men risked death as they reached inside to
pull him to safety moments before the car exploded.
   ``It was natural instinct. We saw him ... in danger and we
automatically went to try to get him out,'' Alvine recalled
Thursday.
   The act of heroism won Alvine, his fellow rescuers and 16 other
Americans and Canadians recognition Thursday from the Carnegie Hero
Fund Commission. Three men died in the performance of their heroism.
   Alvine, 32, of West Caldwell, N.J., was driving shortly before 1
a.m. Nov. 7, 1987, when he and other motorists saw a three-car
accident. Germano, 23, was left unconscious in the driver's seat of
his car.
   ``Germano's car erupted into flames. As I got to his car,
another guy helped me get the door open. Believe me, it was really
hot. We couldn't pull him out because of his seat belt,'' Alvine
said. ``A guy who had a knife came in and cut the seat belt off and
then we crawled into the car and pulled him out and dragged him
away. As soon as we got him out of there, the car blew up again. It
was just ashes when it was all over.''
   Alvine was helped by motorists Richard A. Bogert, 21, of Union,
N.J., and Arthur Richard Palecek, 31, of Oakland, N.J., who also
were honored as heroes.
   The Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, which honors heroes
periodically, awards a medal and $2,500 to those it recognizes. It
has honored 37 people thus far this year and 7,218 people since it
was founded in 1904 by industrialist Andrew Carnegie to honor
heroism by civilians in the United States and Canada.
   Others recognized Thursday were:
   _John Anderson Floyd, 29, of Garden Grove, Calif., and Rubin A.
Vigil, 28, of Buena Park, Calif., who helped rescue a couple and
their two young children from a burning car in Westminster, Calif.,
May 25, 1987. Both men were injured.
   _Christopher J. Young, 30, of Holland, Pa., who saved an infant
from a man with a gun in a doctor's office in Richmond, Va., Nov.
4, 1986.
   _The late John H. King, 39, of Winnipeg, Manitoba, who drowned
after helping to save a 4-year-old girl whose station wagon had
rolled into the Red River at Manitoba June 2, 1987.
   _Robert G. Pourier, 56, of Winnipeg, Manitoba, who helped rescue
the same girl.
   _Robert E. Tindal, 30, of Shallotte, N.C., who saved a
50-year-old woman from drowning in the Atlantic Ocean at Holden
Beach, N.C., Aug. 26, 1987.
   _Paul J. Myers, 39, of Oshawa, Ontario, who rescued a 2-year-old
boy from a burning house in Oshawa Oct. 11, 1986. Myers was injured.
   _Theodore J. Gundler, 33, of Fairfield, Ohio, who saved a
53-year-old woman from in front of an approaching train in
Hamilton, Ohio, Dec. 4, 1987.
   _Daniel H. Penney, 45, of Sidney, British Columbia, who saved a
44-year-old man from a burning car in Sidney Aug. 20, 1986.
   _Thomas H. Schneider, 45, of Redding, Calif., who saved two
young men from a burning car in Red Bluff, Calif., July 5, 1987.
   _Stephen W. Underwood, 36, of Tulelake, Calif., and Matthew H.
Rokes, 25, of Yreka, Calif., who saved a 15-year-old boy from a
cave-in at Lava Beds National Monument near Tulelake May 24, 1987.
   _Nobuichi Kasahara, 65, of Waimea, Hawaii, who saved a
3-year-old girl from drowning in the Pacific cean at Waimea Aug. 3,
1987. Kasahara was hospitalized for exhaustion.
   _Donald Howard Green, 30, of Palmdale, Calif, who saved a
17-year-old boy from a burning car in Los Angeles Dec. 16, 1986.
Green was injured.

<TEXT>
   The October stock market crash threw 7,000
people out of work on Wall Street, but the rest of New York City's
job-generating economy largely continues to boom, according to
figures released Thursday.
   Unemployment in the city reached an 18-year low at 4.7 percent
in the first quarter of the year, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt,
regional commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The national unemployment rate for the quarter was 6.2 percent.
   The improvement in the city showed up across the board, with
joblessness down not only among white men, but also among blacks,
Hispanics, women and teen-agers.
   None of these figures, however, declined to the levels of 1968,
when city unemployment was only 3.1 percent.
   ``It is clear that concerns about imminent and substantial
economic decline following last October's crash have not become
reality,'' Ehrenhalt said in a statement. Some experts had
predicted the city would lose as many as 50,000 jobs in its
financial services sector.
   Although Wall Street has lost 7,000 jobs in the six months since
October, in the two years before that it had added 30,000 jobs to
reach an all-time high of 160,000 people working in the financial
district.
   Also since October, another 4,000 jobs were lost in the
ever-declining manufacturing field.
   But overall, since the October crash, private-sector jobs were
up by 10,000, thanks mainly to an addition of 14,000 service
industry jobs and 5,300 jobs in construction, Ehrenhalt said.

<HEAD>Tells Congress Jordan May Accept Mideast Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz told
Congress on Thursday that ``under the right circumstances'' Jordan
would accept his proposal for a limited Mideast peace conference.
   But Shultz said he failed to enlist the Soviet Union during his
talks last week in Moscow and that the peace conference remains the
``centerpiece'' of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
objections to the U.S. plan for negotiations.
   ``I didn't achieve any breakthrough,'' Shultz told a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that is considering the
administration's request for $3.8 billion to operate the State
Department and international organizations in the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1.
   Shultz had hoped to open Arab-Israeli negotiations next Sunday.
The United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China
would serve as ``sponsors'' for direct talks between Israel and a
mixed delegation of Jordan and Palestinian Arabs.
   So far, only Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is not
directly involved, has publicly supported the proposal.
   But Shultz said ``under the right circumstances such a
conference would be agreeable to Jordan.'' He acknowledged,
however, that ``they haven't said so in so many words.''
   King Hussein of Jordan has insisted on superpower participation
in Mideast negotiations, while Shamir wants to exclude the Soviets
for an active role.
   Hussein seeks international backing for any deal he may make
with Israel, while Shamir is skeptical that the Soviets, who
usually back Arab positions, would play a helpful role in reaching
a settlement.
   Shultz stressed his goal was direct negotiations between Israel
and the Arabs.
   However, he said ``down the road'' the United States, the Soviet
Union and the three other permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council would deal with questions of international
guarantees and refugees.
   These are issues ``international groupings deal with best,''
Shultz said.
   The U.S. plan calls for two stages of negotiations.
   In the first, arrangements would be made to provide some
self-rule for three years for the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who
live on the Israeli-held West Bank and in gaza.
   In the second stage, beginning Dec. 1, negotiations would be
held on the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict. Syria, Egypt and Lebanon
could then join the discussion.
   Shultz also said President Reagan was near a decision on whether
to expand the protection of American warships to neutral shipping
in the Persian Gulf.
   The U.S. Navy is already guiding Kuwaiti oil tankers, flying the
American flag, through the troubled waters and has clashed with
Iranian forces there.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci was returning Thursday night
from a meeting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense
ministers in Brussels. ``The president will decide fairly soon,''
Shultz said.
   Critics have expressed concern the United States is being drawn
into the war between Iran and Iraq.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., on Thursday offered an amendment to
the Pentagon authorization bill to exclude the use of Coast Guard
vessels from duty in the Persian Gulf, as the Pentagon has
recommended.
   Pepper contended the vessels were needed to intercept drug
traffic closer to home.

   Bruce Willis is totally unlike his ``wild man''
image, according to his wife Demi Moore, who says the
``Moonlighting'' star now spends his evenings watching video of
their soon-to-arrive child's ultrasound image.
   ``We watch it all the time _ you can see its little legs
moving,'' said Moore, the star of the new film ``The Seventh
Sign.'' And Willis has already nicknamed the baby King, she told US
magazine for its May 16 issue.
   Willis, who developed a reputation for partying prior to his
marriage, wasn't ``tamed'' by Moore after their walk down the
aisle, she said.
   ``From the day I met him, I never saw this wild man, this person
who was like going crazy, pounding booze back or hanging from the
ceiling,'' she said. ``He was clear and focused.''
   However, she confessed, the couple's Las Vegas wedding last
November was completely spur-of-the-moment.
   ``We were there for a boxing match and didn't plan on getting
married. And I guess the boxing match was just so romantic we
couldn't help ourselves,'' she said.

<HEAD>Robertson Campaign Given Two Weeks to Give IRS Financial Data</HEAD>

   Pat Robertson's presidential campaign was
given additional time Thursday to submit financial records in a
federal investigation of the tax-exempt status of Robertson's
religious broadcasting network.
   U.S. Magistrate Rebecca B. Smith extended a show-cause order for
two weeks, until May 12, for documents originally requested by the
Internal Revenue Service last December.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Raymond Jackson said Americans For
Robertson and James F. Patterson, the group's former treasurer,
have turned over most of the information requested. Jackson has
asked for additional materials, including bank records for
Robertson groups in Texas, Michigan and Virginia.
   Robert L. O'Donnell, attorney for Americans for Robertson, said
the records would be available within five days.
   ``We have not opposed any of the requests and have made records
available as quickly as possible,'' he said in asking for a
continuance of the order filed late last month.
   In addition to financial data, the IRS asked for copies of
fund-raising letters and ``records of any transactions with the
Freedom Council or Christian Broadcasting Network.''
   Robertson, a former television evangelist from Virginia Beach,
founded the non-profit, tax-exempt CBN and was its president until
last October, when he announced his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination. The cable network's operations were turned
over to one of Robertson's sons.
   The Freedom Council, established in 1981 with seed money from
CBN, received nearly $3 million from the network in 1985, according
to former council officials. That was the year Robertson began
setting up his political organization.
   In papers filed with the IRS seeking tax-exempt status, the
Freedom Council said it was created to educate Christians on how to
get involved in politics.
   Critics contend the council acted as a front for the Robertson
campaign by organizing political neophytes from fundamentalist or
charismatic churches as Robertson volunteers.
   The Freedom Council disbanded in 1986 shortly after Americans
for Robertson was formed. Bob Slosser, president of CBN University,
headed the council at the time, and Marc Nuttle, Americans for
Robertson's initial acting director and Robertson's campaign
manager through most of the primaries, served as a paid council
consultant.
   Under federal law, tax-exempt entities cannot raise money for or
support political candidates. The loss of tax-exempt status would
mean contributors could not deduct their donations from income
taxes.

<HEAD>Education Group Urges Schools To Return to Teaching Moral Values</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An educators' group on Thursday urged schools
to take a more active role in teaching students right from wrong,
saying recent increases in teen-age suicides, drug abuse and
pregnancies show the need for common-sense moral values.
   The Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development said
in a 47-page report that too many schools have shied away from
teaching moral values for fear of offending students. But, the
group contended, there are some common values, like honesty,
compassion and altruism, that all Americans believe in, no matter
what their religious beliefs.
   ``There's a great deal of concern across the country about the
morality of adults, from the insider trading scandal on Wall Street
to the Iran-Contra affair,'' said Ron Brandt, executive editor of
the association's publications. ``There's obviously a good deal of
lying and cheating going on in our society, and students are
picking up on that.''
   Brandt added, ``We don't mean to imply that the schools have a
total responsibility for teaching moral values, but they do play a
role.''
   The association, founded 45 years ago, is a group of teachers,
principals and school administrators involved in writing school
curricula and deciding what gets taught. It estimates it has
100,000 members.
   Its report, ``Moral Education in the Life of the School,'' said
concern about moral education has been triggered in the past few
years by ``the substantial, long-term increase in emotional
problems among young Americans'' and cites dramatic rises in the
rates of murders and suicides among young men, increases in the
rate of out-of-wedlock births to adolescents and higher rates of
teen-age drug use.
   ``These data indicate that, by some measures at least, young
people show more self-destructive and other destructive behavior
today than they did two or three decades ago,'' the report said.
   At the same time, the report said, educators grew more ``wary of
even trying to identify common moral values.''
   But educators may have gone too far in avoiding controversy, the
report said. It said recent Gallup polls have shown that the
American public rates drug use and lack of discipline as the two
top problems facing the public schools.
   ``Evidently, the public wants some moral education,''
association executive director Gordon Cawelti said. ``And with
family breakups, the schools are the last remaining place with
moral influence.''
   The report suggested that schools ask parents, local business
leaders and religious and ethnic groups to help put together a list
of values that should be taught in the schools. It provided one
list, put together by the Baltimore County, Md., schools that
included values like courtesy, equality of opportunity, loyalty,
compassion, patriotism and truth.
   ``Values like these constitute our democracy's moral heritage,''
the report said. ``In most communities, substantial majorities can
be mobilized to support statements of principle that include
similar values.''
   Cawelti said that those values then can be taught through
community service projects and even in history and literature
classes, ``where there are themes through the ages of moral and
immoral behavior.''

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Measure Expanding Services To Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed a multibillion-dollar
education measure expanding services to students Thursday, but
expressed regret that ``current Supreme Court jurisprudence'' is
hostile to provisions outlawing pornographic telephone messages.
   In a signing ceremony attended by the bill's sponsors and
supporters in Congress, Reagan said the measure ``reauthorizes and
improves a wide variety of federal programs at the elementary and
secondary school level.''
   ``At the same time, it recognizes a fundamental truth: that the
primary responsibility for educating these children lies with the
local communities and the states and not with the federal
government,'' he said.
   Noting the ban on telephone pornography, the president said, ``I
commend Congress for joining the administration's long-standing
effort to combat hard core obscenity.''
   ``I am bound to note, however, as much as it displeases me, that
current Supreme Court jurisprudence is unfriendly to parts of this
bill,'' he said. ``And I hope that the courts and the Congress will
work with the administration to do as much as is permitted by the
Constitution to enforce the provisions of this statute.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the ban on telephone
pornography, saying that, although born of concern for children, it
intrudes on the privacy and free speech rights of American adults.
   ``No court has ever upheld a complete ban on non-obscene,
so-called `indecent' speech,'' Barry Lynn, legislative counsel to
the ACLU, said after Senate passage of the measure.
   The signing ceremony was attended by Rep. Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., and Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., the principal sponsors
of the bill, and by Republicans and Democrats in both houses who
joined them in sponsorship.
   The act authorizes up to $8.3 billion in spending next year on
elementary and secondary school programs, with more than half the
money going to disadvantaged children at risk of failing.
   It contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help high
school students with weak skills, and greatly expands drug abuse
education and magnet schools. New money also was earmarked for
math, science and foreign-language programs.
   The bill, a compromise between the versions passed by the House
and Senate, was approved by voice vote in the Senate and by a vote
of 397-1 in the House, with Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ind., voting
against it.
   The largest single program in the measure will pay for tutoring
and other services to disadvantaged children who are in danger of
failing academically. School districts could receive basic grants
totaling up to $4.7 billion in the 12 months beginning Oct. 1, , a
$400 million increase over current spending.
   Other initiatives in the bill include $50 million for ``Even
Start,'' to jointly educate poor preschool children and their
illiterate parents; $50 million for dropout prevention
demonstration projects; and $200 million to improve basic skills of
high school students.
   ``From the beginning, we worked with Congress, educators and the
public to assure legislation that would assure basic education for
America's youth,'' Reagan said.

   Bakers and street vendors joined a protest
strike Thursday that virtually closed down the occupied territories
and Arab east Jerusalem. Israeli army gunfire killed one
Palestinian and wounded two.
   The effectiveness of the strike was at odds with declarations by
Israeli authorities that the 5-month-old rebellion in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip had begun to ebb.
   Underground Palestinian leaders called the strike in a bulletin
issued last week, and it appeared to be as widespread as dozens of
others since the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied lands
began what even the Israelis now call the ``intefadah'' _ the
uprising.
   Arab reporters said bakers and street vendors, who usually
operate during strikes, joined this one in most areas.
   An army spokesman said troops shot and killed a 20-year-old Arab
when they were attacked by hundreds of protesters after entering
the village of Malek near the West Bank city of Ramallah. The
soldiers were apparently going to conduct a search.
   The spokesman said the troops were attacked with stones and a
firebomb and fired in the direction from which the firebomb came,
killing the Palestinian.
   The killing raised the Arab death toll in the rebellion to 175.
An Israeli teen-ager and a soldier have also died.
   In Hebron on the West Bank, about 100 young Palestinians set
tires ablaze in front of the municipal building and shouted for the
resignation of Mayor Abdel Majid Zir, Arab witnesses said. Zir was
appointed by Israel.
   A 20-year-old protestor, Raed Shuhkee, was wounded by gunfire
when Israeli troops dispersed the crowd with tear gas, rubber
bullets and live ammunition, the witnesses said.
   Dozens of Arabs blocked the road to Ebween, a village near
Ramallah with rocks and burning tires, then threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who arrived in three jeeps, a villager reported.
   The villager, who would not give his name, said a 23-year-old
man was shot. He spoke to a reporter at Ramallah Hospital, where
the victim was being treated for a gunshot wound in the right leg.
   Army spokesmen confirmed a protester was wounded in Hebron and
another near Ramallah, but said they were investigating.
   Hundreds of Palestinians have been wounded since the violence
began Dec. 8.
   Israel radio said the army bulldozed an orange grove outside
Bethlehem after a jeep skidded off a nearby road on which
Palestinians had spread oil.
   Soldiers followed footprints from the road to the orange grove,
the radio said. Reporters who went there later found bulldozer
tracks and a half-acre of uprooted orange trees.
   In south Lebanon, just across Israel's northern border, Israeli
troops and their Christian militia allies fired flares and
conducted searches overnight to try to close the route Palestinian
guerrillas used to enter Israel on Tuesday and Wednesday, a U.N.
official said.
   Soldiers and militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
set up roadblocks and questioned hundreds of Lebanese in the search
for collaborators, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The militia is the army's surrogate in the ``security
zone'' Israel maintain north of the frontier.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Wednesday the two border
crossings were an attempt at something spectacular to spur the
rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied
since the 1967 Middle East war. They led to firefights in which
five guerrillas and two Israeli soldiers died.
   Predictions of a calming in the territories followed several
days of comparatively little violence, and Thursday's strike was
generally peaceful.
   Arabs blocked roads with wrecked cars and stones in several
cities in Gaza and the West Bank, and taxi and bus stands were
empty in east Jerusalem. Witnesses in Gaza City said young
Palestinians wearing checkered Arab scarves over their faces
stopped cars to keep workers from reaching jobs in Israel.
   Palestinian flags, outlawed by Israel, flew in the center of
Bethlehem. Manger Square, usually crowded, was nearly deserted.

<HEAD>Grapefruit Not Poisonous After All, Ministry Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials said Thursday that the blue
substance injected into some grapefruit in Rome was not poisonous,
and they revoked a nationwide ban on sales of the citrus fruit.
   The Health Ministry had ordered a seizure of all grapefruit in
Italy and triggered an alert in 11 other Common Market countries
when they reported Tuesday that they found six grapefruit poisoned
in an apparent act of sabotage aimed at Israeli exports.
   But the ministry said Thursday that lab tests determined the
substance was methylene blue, a non-toxic biological stain also
used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning.
   None of the other grapefruit seized was found to be tainted. It
was not known whether the six tainted grapefruit actually were from
Israel.
   Authorities found the six tainted fruit in a Rome supermarket
after a caller warned a Rome newspaper that grapefruit there had
been poisoned. The caller claimed responsibility for the
``Organization of Metropolitan Proletarians and Oppressed People,''
a group not previously heard of.
   A poster pasted on the outside of the supermarket urged a
boycott of Israeli products.
   The week before, an organization that said it supported the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip claimed to
have poisoned Israeli grapefruit on sale in Milan and called for a
boycott of Israeli products. Laboratory checks found no trace of
poison.
   Health Minister Donat Cattin ordered the nationwide seizure when
three laboratory mice died after eating blue pulp from some of the
grapefruit.
   But officials began to doubt the grapefruit had been poisoned
because all the other rats, mice and guinea pigs used in additional
tests on Wednesday survived.
   Health officials speculated that the first three mice may have
died from the fiber in the fruit.
   ``Grapefruit is not a food for mice,'' said Israel Adato, an
Israeli Ministry of Agriculture official sent to Italy to assist in
the inquiry.

<HEAD>Reagans Invited To Private Dinner During Moscow Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raisa Gorbachev has written Nancy Reagan to
invite her and President Reagan to a private dinner during the
upcoming summmit in Moscow, a White House spokeswoman said on
Thursday.
   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, declined to quote
from the letter, but said the wife of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev expressed pleasure at having the opportunity to see the
Reagans again.
   The letter extended the dinner invitation on behalf of Mrs.
Gorbachev and the general secretary, Mrs. Crispen said.
   The Reagans are scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Sunday, May 29,
and to depart on June 2.
   Tentatively, the Soviet state dinner is slated for Monday, and a
reciprocal U.S. dinner for the Soviets on Tuesday, leaving
Wednesday as the probable date for the private dinner meeting.
   Mrs. Reagan responded to Mrs. Gorbachev on Wednesday, telling
Mrs. Gorbachev that she was ``anticipating with pleasure'' the
chance to visit with the Gorbachevs.
   ``I am anxious to see your beautiful country and my husband
joins in sending you and the general secretary our very best
wishes,'' Mrs. Crispen quoted Mrs. Reagan as writing.
   The spokeswoman added that the first lady has chosen the Dave
Brubeck Quartet as the entertainment at the dinner they will host
for the Gorbachevs at Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's residence
in Moscow.
   Mrs. Crispen said the first lady decided on the Brubeck group
because ``the Soviets really enjoy American jazz.''
   She said the group has played previously in the Soviet Union, as
well as earlier this year at a White House dinner for the nation's
governors.

<HEAD>Inquiry Demanded After Death of Human Rights Activist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Czechoslovak human rights
organizations Thursday demanded that Parliament open an
investigation into the death of imprisoned human rights activist
Pavel Wonka.
   Wonka, a 35-year-old auto mechanic, was known to be suffering
from intestinal problems and other ailments when he died in a Czech
prison on Tuesday, but he was not fatally ill, according to a
Vienna emigre source.
   ``We therefore call on the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly
(Parliament) to launch an inquiry into the circumstances of Pavel
Wonka's death and publish the results of this inquiry,'' said a
joint statement issued by the Prague-based Committee for the
Unjustly Prosecuted, known as VONS, and the human rights
organization Charter 77.
   The statement was reported in Palach Press, a London-based
newsletter monitoring human rights in Czechoslovakia.
   VONS said it was the first time in its 10-year history that it
had to report the death of a political prisoner.
   ``Regardless of the cause of death, it will be necessary to
ascertain exactly to what extent the prison authorities and wardens
can be held responsible,'' Thursday's statement said.
   Palach Press said the death of Wonka was not explained in a
telegram sent to his family by prison authorities in Hradec
Kralove, a city about 60 miles east of Prague.
   The newsletter also demanded that Czech health and justice
ministers allow independent doctors to be present at Wonka's
autopsy and said Dr. Robert S. Lawrence of Harvard University was
ready to attend the post-mortem.
   Wonka, who was released Feb. 26 after serving a 21-month prison
sentence, was to be under ``protective surveillance'' for three
years after he was freed.
   An emigre source in Vienna on April 13 quoted VONS as saying
Wonka was rearrested on April 5. Palach Press said Wednesday that
Wonka was sentenced to another five-month jail term on unspecified
charges April 21.

<HEAD>NATO To Forge Ahead With Nuclear Arms Improvements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers Thursday vowed
to upgrade short-range nuclear arms following the accord to ban
intermediate-range missiles and an earlier decision to remove 1,400
nuclear warheads from Europe.
   In related comments, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci called a
move in Denmark to firm up the country's anti-nuclear stance a
``fundamental challenge'' to NATO's defense strategy.
   Washington will not end its ``very firm policy'' of not
confirming or denying its warships carry nuclear arms, he said.
   ``We cannot have that policy whittled away at in any way, shape
or form,'' Carlucci said.
   The Danish parliament adopted a motion April 14 demanding
warships be reminded not to carry nuclear arms each time they visit
a Danish port. Denmark's minority center-right government has
called for early elections over the issue.
   British Defense Secretary George Younger said Britain, too, will
never say if its navy ships are nuclear-armed or not.
   He and Carlucci spoke after a two-day meeting at which the
defense ministers agreed to continue to seek improvements in NATO's
nuclear arms in Europe.
   NATO is studying how to upgrade short-range nuclear arms after a
1983 decision to remove 1,400 nuclear warheads from Europe and the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty to remove ground-launched,
medium-range missiles.
   The agreement was signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Some tactical arms are now being modernized, including artillery
shells and jets carrying both nuclear and conventional arms,
Carlucci said.
   On introducing by the mid-1990s new ground-to-ground and
air-to-ground missiles, he said, ``There are no particular
deployment decisions that need to be addressed at this point.''
   But NATO will ``proceed at a measured pace'' to improve its
nuclear arms in Europe, Carlucci added.
   In a communique, the defense ministers said,
   ``For the forseeable future nuclear forces will continue to play
an integral role in providing for deterrence ... their presence in
Europe is therefore essential.''
   It added NATO will keep these arms ``up-to-date where
necessary.''
   Carlucci briefed the allies on intelligence reports that Moscow
continues to upgrade or redeploy nuclear arms not covered by the
INF treaty.
   Sources said Moscow has deployed more than 4,000 tactical
aircraft, 25 to 30 percent of which are nuclear-armed. Also, it is
retargeting missiles such as the long-range SS-24s and SS-25s,
officials said.
   The Soviets, Younger said, were ``undoubtedly busy keeping their
weapons systems up-to-date.''
   The ministers called the INF treaty ``a milestone in our efforts
to achieve a more secure peace at lower levels of arms.''
   They restated their support for superpower efforts to halve
their strategic nuclear forces. Hopes have faded that a START
treaty can be signed at the May 29-June 2 U.S.-Soviet summit in
Moscow.
   Carlucci said that given the progress in East-West arms control
negotiations, the Danish parliament resolution to tighten up the
country's anti-nuclear ban came ``at a particularly unfortunate
point in time.''
   NATO Secretary-General Lord Carrington said the motion ``would
obviously lead to very great difficulties in the alliance'' if
implemented.
   Danish Defense Minister Bernt Johan Collet told the NATO
ministers that early elections had been called for May 10 to seek
``a political mandate'' for continued, full NATO membership for his
country.
   A poll published Thursday showed that most Danes want to have a
nuclear-free zone in Scandinavia, and nearly half would favor the
idea even if it meant leaving NATO.

   Japan has strengthened its export controls and
is cooperating in efforts to prevent leaks of strategic technology
to the Soviet bloc, the State Department said Thursday.
   ``We are engaged in a continuing dialogue with Japan and our
other ... partners in efforts to prevent illegal diversion of
strategic technology to proscribed destinations,'' department
spokesman Alex Almasov said.
   He declined comment on a report that U.S. agents in Singapore
had foiled a bid to buy hundreds of computers from Japan, saying,
``We do not comment publicly on details of these exchanges.''
   But, he added, ``I would note that the government of Japan has
taken steps to improve its strategic export controls and is working
cooperatively with us to strengthen the multilateral COCOM system.''
   COCOM is the Paris-based Coordinating Committee of NATO and
other U.S.-allied countries that oversees trade in strategic
technology. Its monitoring operations are being overhauled in the
wake of disclosures about the sale by Japanese and Norwegian firms
of silent submarine propellor technology to the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>FCC Urged To Reverse Revocation Of 14 Radio, TV Licenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for RKO General Inc. defended the
company's integrity Thursday and urged the Federal Communications
Commission to reverse an initial decision to revoke its 14 radio
and television station licenses.
   Attorney Timothy Dyk told the three sitting FCC commissioners
that an administrative law judge's charge that RKO General has
demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty with advertisers as well as
the commission is undeserved.
   Since the FCC stripped RKO of its license for WNAC-TV in Boston
in 1980, the company ``has recognized it had made a serious mistake
and has been candid with the commission,'' Dyk said.
   The regulatory agency refused to renew RKO's license for the
station on grounds that the company had filed false financial
statements with the FCC and lacked candor in its dealings with the
commission.
   The WNAC proceeding, begun in 1969, and another involving
KHJ-TV, Los Angeles, begun in 1965, ultimately called into question
all of RKO's radio and TV licenses. In jeopardy are the licenses
for broadcast properties the company estimates are worth $400
million to $500 million.
   FCC Commissioner James H. Quello, in an opening statement before
Dyk's presentation, noted that he had voted with the minority in
the FCC's decision to revoke RKO's license for WNAC-TV and called
the action ``the harshest and most unwarranted decision in the
history of the commission.''
   The commission is considering the recommendations of
Administrative Law Judge Edward J. Kuhlmann, who in an initial
decision last August cited RKO for fraudulent billing practices,
overcharging of advertisers and destroying an internal audit report.
   In characterizing the extent of the alleged improprieties,
Kuhlmann said ``no case ever before decided by this commission
presents dishonesty comparable to RKO's.''
   Dyk said ``RKO took misconduct seriously'' and relied on a
system of audits and outside controls to assure management that the
company, owned by Akron, Ohio-based GenCorp., and its stations were
complying with FCC rules.
   Problems, however, occurred because of ``manipulation and
evasion of the system'' by individuals within the company, a
consequence for which RKO cannot be blamed for negligence, he said.
   But Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis asked: ``How can there be
so much manipulation and evasion of the system that didn't come to
the attention of management?''
   Attorney Nathanial F. Emmons, representing Fidelity Television
Inc. of Norwalk, Calif., one of the companies that challenged RKO's
fitness to hold a broadcast license, estimated that RKO's Radio
Networks advertisers were defrauded of $13 million from 1980-84. He
said RKO misinformed advertisers, ran spots at times other than
those agreed and falsified ratings data.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick asked Dyk why the problem at
Radio Networks, coming after the WNAC license revocation, ``doesn't
suggest that management reforms were grossly inadequate.''
   Dyk conceded that ``there was this terrible problem at Radio
Networks,'' but he said RKO's conduct violated no FCC rules or
policies and noted that the company reported the problem to the
commission.
   ``This company has been under an absolute microscope, in one
hearing after another and inquiring into its activities, and I
think it is very, very significant that in its actual broadcast
operations _ what the stations were doing in their broadcast
operations _ there wasn't any significant impropriety and that
should be the most importand thing,'' he said.
   The stations involved are: KHJ-TV, KHJ-AM and KRTH-FM, Los
Angeles; WHBQ-TV and WHBQ-AM, Memphis, Tenn.; WOR-AM and WRKS-FM,
New York; WRKO-AM and WROR-FM, Boston; WGMS-AM, Bethesda, Md.;
WGMS-FM, Washington; KFRC-AM, San Francisco; WAXY-FM, Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.; and WFYR-FM, Chicago.

<HEAD>Agency to Urge Israel to Improve Work Conditions in West Bank,
Gaza</HEAD>

   The International Labor Organization will soon
call on Israel to correct working conditions and improve wages and
trade union rights of Palestinians living on the Israeli-occupied
Gaza Strip and West Bank, the head of the United Nations agency
said Thursday.
   ``The conditions under which Palestinian workers are being
employed are not satisfactory,'' ILO Director-General Francis
Blanchard said. ``The Gaza Strip has become a hellish place.
Everyone agrees it's bad, including the Israelis.''
   Blanchard made the remarks in an informal meeting with several
reporters as a Palestinian protest strike against Israel's
occupation virtually shut down east Jerusalem and cities in the
occupied territories.
   He said he is preparing a report partly based on a visit to the
trouble spot that would put the 150-member-nation ILO at its
convention in Geneva in June as calling on Israel for several
reforms.
   Blanchard, a French civil servant during World War II, described
what he saw in his visit to the occupied territories last week as
``surrealistic _ as surrealistic as the time when Germany was
occupying France.''
   ``What is visible is the occupation,'' he said, ``... The army,
the restrictions, the regulations, the repression. The ILO has
nothing to do with a political settlement, but as far as the labor
field is concerned, it might try to do what it can.''
   Blanchard acknowledged his organization falls short of being a
tribunal and has no sanctions that it can impose for violations of
its 161 internationally recognized labor standards.
   ``But we have lots of means of exercising pressure in the moral
sense,'' he said.
   While Israeli authorities have tried to cope with Arabs who live
in the occupied territories but commute daily to jobs in Israel,
several problems and distortions remain, Blanchard said.
   ``Among the 100,000 Palestinians who work in Israel, no more
than 47 percent have regular employment,'' he said. ``There are
bound to be differences when it comes to wages, especially where
part-time workers are concerned.''
   Blanchard said his report will recommend seeking new assurances
from Israel to both end discrimination against Arab workers and
provide additional assistance to them.
   He acknowledged it is difficult to differentiate between labor
and political rights in the current turmoil but said it would be a
mistake to wait until a peace agreement is concluded before
addressing the worker rights issues.
   ``In the Gaza Strip and to less extent on the West Bank, the
situation calls for dramatic and urgent actions on bringing real
development,'' he said. ``We can't remain in the status quo; the
two have to move in parallel.''
   Although Israel has recognized Palestinian labor unions and even
has some Arabs in the leadership of its own labor movement, their
effectiveness has been set back by the recent uprisings.
   ``The Palestinian trade unions are being prevented from
discharging their responsibilities because of measures taken by the
military,'' Blanchard said. ``Israeli labor leaders show a lot of
compassion to Palestinian workers but the government needs to do
more to make it possible for the Palestinian unions to operate.''

<HEAD>Lower Energy Costs, Stable Dollar Help Slow Import Goods Price
Hikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of imported goods climbed 1.2 percent
in the first three months of the year, a slight slowdown from the
October-December quarter because of lower energy costs and a more
stable dollar, the government reported Thursday.
   The Labor Department said the January-March increase followed a
1.6 percent rise in the final three months of 1987. For the past 12
months, import prices have risen 7.1 percent.
   The price of foreign oil and other energy products fell 8
percent during the first quarter. If this drop in energy prices was
removed, import prices would have risen a much faster 2.3 percent
in the past three months.
   Foreign cars and machinery, which account for nearly half of all
U.S. imports, rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter after
increasing 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
   Analysts said the latest government statistics confirm their
view that the weaker dollar, which makes imports more expensive, is
responsible for about half the inflation the country is now
experiencing.
   Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent in 1987 and analysts said that
increase would have been only about 2 percent without the rise in
import costs.
   ``The dollar has been going down and we don't think all of that
has been passed through to consumers yet,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ``Foreign
producers had been eating much of the dollar's decline in lower
profits, but they can't do that anymore.''
   The import price report said that from January from March, the
dollar lost 1.4 percent of its value on a trade-weighted basis
compared with a 5.8 percent plunge in the October-December quarter.
   The Reagan administration, led by Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III, began working with U.S. allies in September 1985 to
drive the value of the dollar lower in an effort to shrink the
country's huge foreign trade deficits. A weaker dollar makes
American goods more competitive on overseas markets while driving
up the cost of imports to Americans.
   In February 1987, after the dollar had fallen by almost 50
percent against the Japanese yen and the West German mark, the
major industrial countries switched course and began trying to keep
the dollar from falling further.
   That effort was unsuccessful in 1987 because stubbornly high
merchandise trade deficits made investors believe the dollar had
not dropped enough to cure the country's trade problems. Only two
weeks ago, the dollar fell sharply because of a widening of the
February U.S. trade deficit.
   While the U.S. merchandise trade deficit hit a record high of
$171.2 billion last year, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
said Thursday that a new analysis by his office showed that the
country's trade deficit has actually fallen by 23.2 percent since
mid-1986, when the effects of the weaker dollar are removed.
   He said the monthly trade report, which does not factor out
inflation, has masked the improvements that have been occurring in
volume terms.
   But Wyss said financial markets will continue to react to
monthly trade figures in current dollars until they start showing
significant improvements as well.
   ``U.S. export volume is growing very rapidly, but unfortunately
not fast enough to overcome the sharp increases in import prices,''
he said.
   The Labor Department report said the cost of American products
being sold overseas rose by 1.4 percent during the first quarter, a
drop from a 2 percent price increase in the final three months of
1987. This change was credited to a big slowdown in the cost of
exported food products, which rose only 0.6 percent in the first
quarter after shooting up by 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter.
   American grain prices rose 3.1 percent following a 14.2 percent
jump in the fourth quarter as a drop in wheat prices helped offset
continued increases in rice and corn prices.
   The price of American meat products rose 5.1 percent following
six months of declines, while the index for fruits and vegetables
fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.

<HEAD>Rightists Try to Shake Extremist Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the conservative
Arena party hope to step into a prominent role in the war-strapped
government and are trying to shake their image of being right-wing
extremists.
   The party, which won at least 30 of the 60 seats in the National
Assembly in legislative elections March 20, has big hopes of
winning the presidency next year.
   If it does, Washington's policy toward El Salvador will have to
change drastically, party president Alfredo Cristiani told The
Associated Press in an interview.
   ``Relations will have to be based on mutual respect. No more
coming down here and saying `Here's so many millions of dollars and
this is what you have to do,''' said Cristiani.
   The party, whose full name is the Republican Nationalist
Alliance, previously held only 13 assembly seats, so the election
outcome was a devastating setback for President Jose Napoleon
Duarte's Christian Democratic Party.
   One seat remains in dispute, but the assembly is to be installed
as scheduled Sunday.
   Arena also won two-thirds of the municipal races at stake in
March, including longtime Christian Democratic stronghold San
Salvador.
   The conservative party once was best known for its controversial
founder, cashiered army major Roberto d'Aubuisson.
   Cristiani, a 40-year-old Georgetown University-educated
businessman, has been a major factor in the effort to leave behind
the party's image of neo-fascist thugs.
   But the public relations project intended to present Arena as
moderate suffers setbacks.
   Retired army Col. Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, an Arena leader and
legislator-elect, recently called for ``insurrection'' against what
he termed ``this ominous government, this treasonous High Command.''
   He accused the armed forces leadership of selling out to ``North
American intervention.''
   Cristiani said the State Department and the U.S. Embassy have
waged a constant campaign against Arena, founded in 1981.
   ``We have always felt under tremendous attack from the
government of the United States,'' he said.
   Robert White, who was U.S. ambassador in El Salvador in the late
70s and early 80s, once called d'Aubuisson ``a pathological
killer.'' Arena alleges that the U.S. Embassy backed what the
rightists claim was fraud in elections won by the Christian
Democrats in 1984 and 1985.
   Arena won the March elections by broadening its appeal beyond
the rabidly anti-communist landed oligarchy it represented in the
early 1980s.
   Cristiani has emerged as a leader since d'Aubuisson, a former
major in army intelligence, decided in 1985 to share the limelight.
   ``He (d'Aubuisson) recognized that his figure and all that had
been said about him were prejudicial to the party's image,'' said
the strapping, soft-spoken Cristiani, who exports coffee and
distributes pharmaceuticals.
   ``He expressed the desire to no longer be a preponderant figure
and the party made the principal decision to become a political
institution that does not depend on the charismatic image of one
man ... that it should open up,'' said Cristiani.
   Arena has been routinely referred to by local and foreign media
as ``far-'' or ``extreme-rightist.''
   ``But if you had to place us in the North American political
spectrum, we're closer to conservative Democrats or liberal
Republicans than to conservative Republicans,'' Cristiani said.
   Critics of the party say d'Aubuisson's continued prominence, as
well as Ochoa's, provide room for doubt about the party's professed
commitment to democracy.
   Cristiani said Arena favors establishment of a private banking
sector parallel to the nationalized system and a private role in
the state-run enterprises that export the country's main crops:
coffee, sugar and cotton.
   An Arena government would try to resume the stalled dialogue
with leftist guerrillas, but if that failed, military pressure
would be increased.
   Some 65,000 people have been killed in the eight years of
fighting, and the economy is crippled by inflation and unemployment
estimated at 40 percent.

   Anxiety about drug trafficking and foreign
economic power match fear of the Soviet Union as the top concerns
of Americans, according to a survey issued Thursday by a group that
includes pollsters for Michael Dukakis and George Bush.
   Given a choice of seven national security goals, 22 percent of
those surveyed picked combatting international drug traffic as the
No. 1 priority. Another 18 percent said correcting America's
growing trade imbalance was the most important goal. Reducing U.S.
and Soviet long range missiles was chosen by 15 percent of those
surveyed.
   Keeping communist governments out of Central and Southern
America was the No. 1 national security desire of 13 percent of
those quizzed, containing Soviet agression was the chief concern of
12 percent, stopping the threat of nuclear weapons topped the list
for 11 percent and combatting terrorism was the priority for 5
percent.
   The poll said 59 percent of the American people believe economic
competitors like Japan pose more of a threat to national security
than traditional military adversaries like the Soviets.
   It was the fourth poll in a series called ``Americans Talk
Security,'' a 10-survey collaborative effort by four organizations,
including Martilla & Kiley, of Boston, Dukakis' pollster, and
Market Opinion Research of Detroit, which works for Bush. Martilla
& Kiley conducted the latest poll, but the questions and analysis
were approved by all four organizations.
   By a margin of 3-to-1, Americans believe economic power is more
important than military strength in determining a country's
influence in the world.
   Asked about U.S. relations with the Soviet Union, 61 percent
said they were improving, 4 percent thought they were getting worse
and 34 percent said they were remaining the same.
   Seventy-six percent said they had a ``favorable'' general
impression of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and 66 percent said
Gorbachev's policies will eventually create a more free and open
society.
   Asked if U.S. policy should focus less on the Soviets and more
on other threats to our security, 48 percent sought less focus on
the Soviets and 42 said the focus should remain on the Soviets.
   The pollsters for the leading presidential candidates said they
found encouraging results in the survey.
   Tom Kiley, who polls for Dukakis, said the Democrats are pleased
that the survey shows a ``broadening prism'' through which
Americans look at security issues.
   Fred Steeper, whose Market Opinion Research company works for
Bush, said he was bouyed that 61 percent of Americans chose
``improved efficiency'' as the key to reducing the trade deficit
compared to 24 percent who chose ``fairer trade practices.''
   ``That result is a blow against a protectionist stance,''
Steeper said.
   The ATS poll was based on a March 22-27 national telephone
survey of 1,004 Americans. The margin of error was 3 percent, ATS
said.

<HEAD>TV Rejects Government Request to Postpone Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television authorities on Thursday rejected a
government request to postpone screening a program on the shooting
of three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas by British
commandos in Gibraltar.
   The program, by London's Thames Television, shows a witness
saying two guerrillas had their hands raised, as if to give
themselves up, when they were shot.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe asked Lord Thompson,
chairman of the controlling Independent Broadcasting Authority, to
postpone the Thursday night broadcast until after an inquest into
the March 6 shooting of the guerrillas, who had been on a bombing
mission in the British colony.
   The Foreign Office said that the hourlong program, ``Death On
The Rock,'' featured people due to testify at the inquest and
complained that their accounts would influence the hearing.
   But the broadcast authority said the material was ``unlikely to
prejudice'' the inquest and that postponing the program would give
the IRA more ``oxygen of publicity.''
   The show was the result of a seven-week investigation which
included interviews with 150 residents of apartments overlooking
the area where the guerrillas were shot, according to Thames TV.
   The British commandos' decision to shoot the guerrillas instead
of trying to arrest them angered the Irish government and was
criticized by British opposition parties and Amnesty International.
The London-based human rights organization has begun its own
inquiry.
   Howe has said that the guerrillas made suspicious movements
before they were shot. A Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom
was not identified, said Thursday that Howe stood by that statement.
   The government's request to postpone ``Death on The Rock''
touched off a noisy debate Thursday in the House of Commons.
   Conservative Jerry Hayes said he was opposed to ``TV companies
raking through the gutters of Gibraltar finding people to rubbish
our security forces'' and was tired of ``people weeping tears for
an active IRA unit'' that was plotting a massacre.
   But Kevin McNamara, the opposition Labor Party's Northern
Ireland spokesman, said the government was trying to block an
examination of its ``conduct and policies by hiding behind the
theory of an inquest.''
   ``Those three (guerrillas) were unarmed,'' he said. ``They
should have been arrested. They should have been charged.''
   The Gibraltar killings triggered a fresh outbreak of violence in
Northern Ireland in which nine people, including two British
soldiers, died.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Rail Grain Car Shortage Blamed on Heavy Export Demand, No Building</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy export demand for wheat and corn and
``the virtual stagnation of the covered hopper fleet since 1982''
created a shortage of railroad grain cars to move farmers' grain,
an Agriculture Department transportation official said Thursday.
   Although car shortages appear to be easing somewhat in recent
days, steps need to be taken to avoid a repetition of the crunch
that occurred earlier this year, said Martin Fitzpatrick Jr., head
of the department's Office of Transportation.
   Fitzpatrick released a study showing a severe disruption of
grain shipments in the United States this year through mid-April
because of shortages of covered hopper cars used by railroads.
   The study was requested by Reps. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., and
Virginia Smith, R-Neb. Fitzpatrick said he planned to cite the
study further at a hearing Monday in Kansas City, Mo., conducted by
a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.
   Fitzpatrick said the actual number of cars available for grain
movement has been both shrinking and aging since 1982 when the last
significant number was added to the nation's railroad fleet.
   There also has been a large surge in export wheat sales under
the Agriculture Department's Export Enhancement Program during the
past few months. Big sales to the Soviet Union, in particular, have
added to the railroad grain traffic.
   Under EEP, exporters can sell wheat or other designated
commodities to an approved foreign country at reduced prices and
then collect subsidies from USDA in the form of government-owned
surplus grain or other agricultural products.
   Fitzpatrick told reporters there were many reasons for the
problem and that USDA policies regarding exports were not to blame.
He said the ``overwhelming reason'' for EEP was to give U.S.
negotiators leverage in multinational trade talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and also to reduce U.S. surpluses
and to boost farm income.
   ``Those goals, I think, are ahead of the goal of keeping the
(railroad) car supply adequate,'' he said.
   At another point, Fitzpatrick said of USDA programs, ``We
believe we are not the problem in any way, because we believe we
are doing our job. ... We're pround of what we've done.''
   Fitzpatrick said that because of shortages of covered hopper
cars some local elevators were unable to take delivery of grain
from farmers, grain merchants had difficulty completing sales, and
railroads hiked rates and restricted use of their cars in certain
markets.
   Also, he said, the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
``received limited response'' to its weekly auctions of surplus
wheat because of the car shortages.
   Fitzpatrick was asked whether the rail car shortages had
interfered with shipments of grain to seaports to the extent that
ships were kept waiting on grain to load.
   ``We do not believe that to be the case, as a general rule,'' he
said. But there may have been ``some specific circumstances'' when
that happened in the last six months. ``It's not a trend, it is not
a significant problem down the road.''
   Although reasons are not clear why the hopper car situation has
improved the last 10 days, Fitzpatrick noted that export demand has
slackened somewhat and delivery dates have eased. Also, he said,
railroads had received overbookings for cars from grain companies,
and many of those now are being reconciled.

   The mother of Harrison Graham pleaded for
the life of her son Thursday, telling the judge who will impose
sentence that Graham did not kill the seven women whose bodies were
found in and near his apartment.
   ``I don't think you should take his life,'' said Lillian Graham
Jeter, wiping tears from her eyes. ``He didn't kill those people.
The real murderer is still out there. I'm asking you to listen to
your heart.''
   Her testimony came during a hearing before Common Pleas Judge
Robert Latrone, who will decide whether to sentence Graham, 28, an
unemployed handyman, to life imprisonment or death in the electric
chair.
   ``I don't want to appear heartless, but I have determined his
guilt,'' Latrone said, referring to his verdict of guilty on
Wednesday to seven counts of first degree murder and seven counts
of abuse of corpse. ``I can well understand how you feel, but we
are considering what the punishment might be.''
   The hearing concluded at midafternoon. The judge did not specify
when he would rule.
   Latrone had found that the prosecution proved that Graham killed
seven women between January and August 1987 and kept their rotting
remains locked in a room in a house he rented in north
Philadelphia. Rejecting an insanity defense, Latrone also found
Graham knew what he was doing when he confessed to strangling the
women as he had sex with them.
   The bodies were found after Graham was evicted because of the
stench coming from his apartment.
   Assistant District Attorney Roger King said death was the only
punishment justifed for such ``sadistic murders.''
   Rose Harriell, mother of one of the victims, Barbara Mahoney,
said: ``I believe he should die. I believe he should have a hard
death. Nothing can bring back my daughter, and I am angry about
that, but I would be angrier yet if he just sits in jail and gets
fatter and fatter.''
   Before Thursday's sentencing hearing began, the judge told
Graham he could have a jury of 12 persons decide his fate. Graham
waived that right on the advice of his lawyer, Joel Muldovsky.
Graham had also waived a jury trial, but under state law retained
the right to have a jury decide the sentence.
   Latrone asked Graham several times whether he understood the
right he was giving up and each time Graham said he knew what he
was doing.
   ``I want you'' to decide the sentence, Graham said.
   Muldovsky proceeded to call witnesses to keep his client from
``frying in the electric chair. He doesn't deserve that.''
   ``You're talking about a creature of habit who went back and
back and back,'' King argued, referring to what he called ``the
arrogant series of sex stranglings.''
   Said Camelia DeShazor Parker, mother of another of the victims,
said, ``He deserves everything he gets.''
   The first defense witness was Pauline Williams, who was Graham's
foster mother for five years.
   ``Marty is a child in a man's body,'' she said. ``Marty is
retarded. He was never raised to hate. He was raised to be
obedient. Marty is alive. I want him to stay alive.''

   Jesse Jackson's bid for the presidency
will mean nothing if he fails to win the Democratic nomination,
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said.
   He and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley were in Fort Worth to speak
at a panel discussion at the National Forum for Black Public
Administrators, which concluded Thursday.
   Young, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
President Carter, said Wednesday that Jackson's campaign has
performed a ``psychological miracle'' for minorities searching for
a leader.
   ``But it really doesn't help at all if he's not elected
president,'' he added. ``It's not just a matter of feeling good.
Jesse ran to see some good done for poor people and black people.''
   But Bradley disagreed with the Atlanta mayor, saying Jackson's
strong showing in the 1988 campaign has already been a victory for
blacks.
   ``He has stimulated the kind of spirit that is very lasting,''
Bradley said.

<HEAD>Kirkpatrick First Choice For VP In Salt Lake</HEAD>

   Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, appears to be Salt Lake County Republicans'
first choice as Vice President George Bush's running mate.
   With 80 percent of Salt Lake County voting districts reporting,
Kirkpatrick garnered 68 votes _ or 25 percent _ in the caucuses.
Complete statewide results were expected late Thursday, state GOP
executive director Greg Hopkins said.
   Kirkpatrick was followed by former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole with 17 percent. White House chief of staff Howard
Baker, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York received
10 percent each.
   Since Bush has already garnered the delegates he needs to win
the nomination, Utah Republicans voiced their preference for vice
president.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He'll Use Trade Veto Against Bush; Jackson Says He
Won't Quit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson charged Thursday that Democratic presidential
front-runner Michael Dukakis had tried to ``manage Reaganomics''
rather than reverse it. Dukakis called on President Reagan to ``put
partisan politics aside'' and drop plans to veto trade legislation.
   All was quiet on the Republican front, where Vice President
George Bush gained a mathematical lock on his nomination with the
delegates earned in Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary. The vice
president was in Washington, with his next campaign trip set for
Friday to Indiana.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis spent most of the day in his
statehouse office in Boston, where he met with Spanish President
Felipe Gonzalez Marques while his campaign organization welcomed a
trickle of additional delegates to the fold.
   The converts included two delegates formerly backing Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee and one supporter of Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois. Both men have suspended their campaigns, but have said
they intend to hold onto their delegates until the party convention.
   Dukakis leads Jackson by more than 400 delegates in the
Associated Press count, and holds more than 1,250 of the 2,081
needed to win the nomination. Aides say they hope he will command a
nominating majority by the time the primary season ends on June 7.
   Dukakis released a letter he sent to Reagan urging him to sign
the trade bill, which contains a provision requiring a 60-day
notice to workers before a factory can be shut down.
   ``Mr. President, I believe that our record trade deficit
requires that we put partisan politics aside and take action that
will be in the best interest of all Americans,'' he wrote.
   Later, in a statehouse news conference, Dukakis said he would
make the trade bill an issue in his campaign against Bush.
   ``I think the issues of workers being laid off, what is
happening to the industrial base of this country, and the failure
of this administration to do much to deal with that and what a new
president would do to work hard with business and labor and
community leaders to restore our competitive edge and rebuild our
industrial base will be very much one of the major issues,'' he
told reporters before leaving for a campaign trip to Ohio and
Indiana.
   Bush has expressed support for Reagan's decision to veto the
bill.
   Jackson campaigned across Ohio, which holds its primary next
week, and vowed to remain in the race.
   His rhetoric held a slightly sharper anti-Dukakis edge than
before the Pennsylvania primary, which Jackson lost in a landslide.
   ``I don't want to manage Reaganomics as Dukakis does, or keep
Reaganomics as Bush does,'' he told an audience in Steubenville,
Ohio. ``I want to reverse Reaganomics and re-invest in America.''
   Jackson also fended off suggestions from his own campaign
manager than he has given up on gaining the nomination in view of
Dukakis' string of primary victories in Connecticut, Wisconsin, New
York and Pennsylvania in the past month.
   ``We intend to come out of California and New Jersey (on the
final day of the primary season) in search of a management team and
a running mate,'' Jackson said. ``That is authoritative, fresh,
clear, without fear of contradiction.''
   He said any suggestions otherwise ``do not represent the spirit
of the campaign,'' although he said campaign chief Gerald Austin
had been an ``effective manager'' who would stay on the job.
   Austin was quoted in published reports as saying of Jackson: ``I
think he thinks winning isn't just winning primaries. It's winning
delegates and getting votes.''
   Dukakis, a year after entering the Democratic race, marveled
that he was the front-runner.
   ``The remarkable thing is that the two leading candidates for
the Democratic nomination are a first-generation American from
Massachusetts and a black guy who grew up poor in South Carolina,''
he said. ``That, I think, says an enormous amount for this
political system of ours.''
   In other developments:
   _ Jackson drew praise from Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young at a
meeting of black public administrators in Fort Worth. He said
Jackson's strong candidacy has performed a ``psychological
miracle'' for minorities seeking a leader. But, he added, ``it
really doesn't help at all if he's not elected president. It's not
just a matter of feeling good. Jesse ran to see some good done for
poor people and black people.''
   _ Campaign officials for former television evangelist Pat
Robertson, who has ceased active campaigning in the Republican
race, were given an additional two weeks to provide the Internal
Revenue Service with financial records. The IRS is conducting a
probe of the tax-exempt status of Robertson's religious
broadcasting network.
   _ Final results from the Vermont Democratic caucuses last week
showed Jackson edged out Dukakis with the support of 46 percent of
caucus-goers to 45 percent for his rival. If the division held, it
would translate into eight national convention delegates for
Jackson and six for Dukakis.

<HEAD>US Must Focus on Reducing Demand in Drug War, Panel Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 6 grafs after 7th graf, ``The Reagan,'' to UPDATE
with material on White House drug policy meeting.</NOTE>

   The United States must give highest priority
to curbing demand for illicit drugs from Latin America if it
expects to win the war against narcotics smuggling, a hemispheric
committee said Thursday.
   In a report, the group said efforts to curb trafficking through
eradication and interdiction have failed and that the United States
should refocus its attention to educating potential users to the
dangers of drug addiction.
   The report was prepared by the Inter-American Dialogue, a
non-partisan group of 62 noted citizens from the United States,
Latin America and Canada.
   ``As long as the profit margin for cocaine is 12,000 percent
from production cost to street value, the lure of trafficking will
be irresistible,'' the panel said in the 50-page report, which
covered a variety of hemispheric issues. ``Primary attention must
shift to demand.''
   The commission is chaired by Sol M. Linowitz, a former U.S.
ambassador to the Organization of American States, and Daniel
Oduber, a former president of Costa Rica. Other members include two
other former Latin American presidents and more than a dozen former
cabinet members from the United States and Latin America.
   The report said efforts to reduce the supply of drugs from Latin
America to the United States are bound to be inadequate, and the
high profit margin for drug smuggling ``will buy all the protection
the drug lords need.''
   The Reagan administration initially concentrated its efforts on
stopping drug smuggling at its source but recently has said more
attention must be given to reducing demand.
   On Thursday, Reagan directed his National Drug Policy Board to
provide recommendations within 30 days on how to increase the
federal effort against drug suppliers and users,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We don't have much time,'' the president was quoted as telling
agency heads who took part in the meeting. ``But I want to do all I
can to expand the drug fight.''
   Fitzwater's statement said Reagan was briefed by board members
``on the status of existing efforts to interdict drugs coming into
this country, and to reduce the demand for drugs within the
country.''
   ``The president was told that our nation must be intolerant of
drug users, that half the murders in the District of Columbia are
drug-related, that gangs in many cities are being financed through
drugs and that the government needs to be as tough as the law and
the Constitution will allow in fighting drug use,'' it said.
   The statement said the board outlined ``the extensive
interdiction effort now under way along United States borders using
United States military and other civilian assets.''
   It also said that Dr. Ian McDonald, the president's special
adviser on drug abuse policy, told Reagan there are nearly 23
million drug users in this country.
   Reagan said in a speech last February, ``As significant as
stopping smugglers and pushers is, ending the demand for drugs is
how, in the end, we'll win.''
   The report also recommended that the United States help other
countries design and implement their own drug-control policies
rather than apply pressure and threaten sanctions if these
countries do not adopt U.S. prescriptions.
   Under law, the administration is required to impose economic
sanctions against countries which do not cooperate in curbing drug
flows into the United States.
   This year, Reagan found that Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and
Pakistan were not offering such cooperation, but no sanctions were
applied because none is a U.S. aid recipient.
   Many members of Congress are clamoring for sanctions against
other countries, and on Wednesday the House Foreign Affairs
Committee voted in favor of taking such action against Bolivia,
Peru and Paraguay.
   Discussing Central America, the report said governments and
insurgent movements in the region should strive to convert their
military strife into peaceful competition.
   ``Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala must convince guerrilla
forces in their countries that laying down their arms will open the
way for full participation in national affairs,'' the report said.
   It also criticized the United States for not working in concert
with other Latin American countries to arrange a settlement in
Panama.
   ``Unilateral U.S. economic sanctions and other pressures against
Panama have hindered efforts by Latin American and European leaders
to promote a negotiated end to Panama's crisis and mobilized
widespread Latin American resentment to U.S. policy,'' the report
said.

<HEAD>Brother, Nephew of Marshal Arrested As Result of His Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HEFLIN, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deputy U.S. marshal's family reunion two
years ago led to a break in a 1980 murder case _ and an indictment
this week against his own brother and a nephew.
   Investigators had worked for years with little progress in
solving the slayings of four elderly people during an apparent
robbery.
   Then, in 1986, the deputy marshal, Olbert Hiett, attended a
family reunion and took a sawed-off shotgun, an illegal weapon,
from his brother, Charles Hiett, 51.
   Later that year, Jerry Hiett, a nephew of the Hiett brothers,
was arrested on charges of starting a fire in Talladega National
Forest, and a .38-caliber pistol was taken from him, District
Attorney Robert Field said.
   Olbert Hiett then realized that the two guns matched
descriptions of weapons used in the 1980 slayings of three brothers
and a sister _ James Columbus Roberts, 79, Mack Roberts, 73, Mae
Bell Roberts, 77, and Floy Roberts, 63. Two were bedridden when
shot to death in the rural Mars Hill community.
   Field said that ballistics tests run on the guns in 1986
confirmed Olbert Hiett's suspicion that the weapons were used in
the slayings.
   Charles Hiett was arrested Tuesday on charges of hindering
prosecution and possession of a sawed-off shotgun other than the
one seized at the reunion, and Jerry Hiett 39, was arrested on
perjury charges, said Cleburn County Sheriff Jack Norton. Anthony
Bell, 29, was arrested Wednesday on perjury charges.
   The three men were being held in the county jail on $100,000
bail each.
   The indictment returned by a county grand jury accused Charles
Hiett of interfering with the murder investigation by altering the
second shotgun to make it appear that it was used in the slaying.
   Charles Hiett gave ``criminal assistance to Bill Hiett and Jerry
Hiett by intentionally hindering the apprehension, prosecution,
conviction or punishment of Bill Hiett and Jerry Hiett for conduct
constituting a murder.''
   However, neither Bill nor Jerry Hiett has been charged with
murder. Bill Hiett's relationship to Jerry and Charles was not
immediately known.
   ``The grand jury listened to evidence that was surrounding the
Mars Hill case,'' Norton said Thursday. ``Three people were
indicted. ... I'm not going to say that the people who are in my
jail are not suspects and I'm not going to say they are.
   ``I'm just going to say they are people who the grand jury saw
fit to indict on those charges.''
   He declined to comment on why the indictments were not returned
sooner.
   Field said the grand jury will reconvene May 31 and more
indictments might be returned.
   Bill Hiett was convicted earlier and sentenced to 20 years in
prison for possessing an illegal weapon, the sawed-off shotgun
Charles Hiett is alleged to have altered. He is free on bail while
he appeals.
   Without Olbert Hiett, ``there would be no case,'' U.S. Marshall
Thomas Green said. ``It's an unusual story.''
   Olbert Hiett's niece, Teresa Loveless, said she is not angry at
him although his efforts put her father in jail.
   ``This isn't a vengeance thing,'' she said. ``They didn't have
any falling out or anything like that. My uncle is a lawman and he
is just doing his job. My father is just telling the truth _ that's
all there is to it.''
   Mrs. Loveless said her father ``is not guilty of anything. All
he has done is tell the truth. My daddy has nothing to hide, so
whether it is to his brother or to the sheriff or anyone else, he
will say the same thing to them.''
   Police have said they believe the motive was $1,500 in cash kept
in a trunk, which was stolen and recovered two years later in woods
three miles from the Roberts' house.
   Verlin Roberts, who discovered the bodies of her brothers and
sister, said she was pleased to hear of apparent progress in the
investigation.
   ``I'm kind of surprised,'' she said. ``I had waited so long and
hadn't heard anything. I thought maybe it wouldn't ever be solved.''

<HEAD>Art Ring Floods Germany With Fake Masterpieces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH JAUTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poor junk dealer who taught himself
to paint churned out 2,500 copies of masterpieces and sold them for
a pittance to an art ring, which netted up to $23 million by
reselling them as originals, police said Thursday.
   The fake Picassos and other paintings were sold throughout the
country during a 13-year period in one of Europe's biggest art
scandals, prosecutors said. At least two of the pictures hang in
museums.
   Artist Edgar Mrugalla, 49, sold nearly all of them for
relatively low prices to art dealerships in Dusseldorf and
Wiesbaden, police said.
   ``Picasso himself would have been proud of his work,'' said
Wolfgang Engelen, the police officer in charge of the
investigation. ``We were told repeatedly (by art experts) that he
is a genius.''
   ``This case is unique,'' he added. ``I have never seen anything
like it.''
   The dealers sold Mrugalla's works at huge mark-ups and kept the
money, netting between $17 million and $23 million, police said.
   Mrugalla was living in poverty when he began cooperating with
police earlier this month, they said.
   One of Mrugalla's fakes is hanging in a West Berlin museum and
another is in a small museum in northern West Germany, Engelen
said. The rest are in the collections of private dealers or art and
auction houses.
   Engelen said Mrugalla copied from the works of more than 50
artists, including Pablo Picasso, Germans George Grosz and Max
Beckmann and Austrian Oskar Kokoschka.
   Police said the ``fake-art ring'' that marketed Mrugalla's works
was believed to include about 25 people.
   Engelen said one of the ringleaders was in jail, but he declined
to say how many other arrests have been made.
   He said Mrugalla rarely attempted to sell any of his fake art
works himself, but passed them along to the Duesseldorf and
Wiesbaden dealers.
   It was not immediately known whether Mrugalla was aware of the
prices his works were commanding.
   He is free on his own recognizance, but could face charges of
forgery and fraud.
   Mrugalla never had formal art training, the mass-circulation
Bild newspaper said Thursday. He grew up in East Berlin and joined
the East German merchant navy at 14, then jumped ship and traveled
to West Berlin, where he opened a junk shop.
   While struggling to make his business profitable, Mrugalla began
copying art works he saw hanging in Berlin museums, Bild said. He
later bought books on painting to teach himself technique.
   Engelen said only a portion of Mrugalla's work has been traced.
Thus far police have seized 100 lithographs supposedly by Otto
Mueller and 24 alleged Picasso sketches, he said.

<HEAD>FAA Finds No `Grossly Unsafe' Conditions in Eastern, Continental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The special inspection of Eastern and
Continental airlines has uncovered no ``grossly unsafe'' conditions
so far, although planes were ordered out of service briefly because
of safety infractions about 5 percent of the time, officials said
Thursday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration began its plane-by-plane
ramp inspections April 13 and so far has made more than 2,000
inspections at the two airlines, FAA Administrator Allan McArtor
told reporters. He said inspections would continue through mid-May.
   Both airlines are owned by Texas Air Corp., the country's
largest airline company, which also is under a special review by
the federal government.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the separate
inspection into the management and financial practices of Texas Air
by his department is half completed and ``everything is going very
well.'' Burnley did not elaborate on any of the findings so far.
   Burnley and McArtor met with reporters to announce a series of
organizational changes at the FAA aimed primarily at centralizing
more authority in the agency's Washington headquarters over its
various regional offices.
   But many of the questions turned to the FAA and department
probes of Texas Air and its two airline subsidiaries.
   McArtor said there have been about 1,000 ramp inspections of
aircraft at Eastern and about the same number at Continental so far
with many of the aircraft inspected more than once at various
airports. The two airlines together have about 580 planes.
   He said ``roughly 7 to 8 percent'' of the inspections at Eastern
and 3 percent of the inspections at Continental have resulted in
aircraft being taken out of service, although in some of the cases
the corrections were made quickly and flights were not delayed.
   ``These are not unusual percentages,'' said McArtor, adding that
they likely would be ``what we would find ... at other airlines''
undergoing a similarly intense series of ramp examinations. In some
cases, he said, Continental corrected problems before they came to
the attention of FAA inspectors, he said.
   ``So far we have not found anything we would consider to be
grossly unsafe on any aircraft,'' McArtor said. He described the
problems found by inspectors as ``minor'' and said they ranged from
dents and small tears in the aircraft skin to minor leaks and
hydraulic gauges not being fully charged.
   But McArtor said that while such problems individually may not
cause a plane to be unsafe, he was concerned about them in the
aggregate if not corrected.
   ``We're dealing with the margin of safety here,'' McArtor said,
adding that if such problems are not corrected that margin could
erode.
   Burnley and McArtor ordered the special review of Eastern
aircraft on April 13 after the FAA became concerned of continuing
safety violations at the Miami-based airline. Eastern also was
assessed with a proposed $823,000 fine because of earlier
violations.
   Four days later, Burnley ordered the ramp inspections expanded
to include the Houston-based Continental as well, saying that the
FAA is considering leveling about $1 million in civil penalties
against that airline. The FAA has not provided details on what kind
of problems were found that would lead to such penalties.

<HEAD>Report Calls for Separating Subsidies from Food Production Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One way to improve global farm policy would be
to unhook, or decouple, government subsidies from specific levels
of food production, a report by the National Center for Food and
Agricultural Policy said Thursday.
   The policy of decoupling would lead to ``more efficient
production of agricultural goods and lower production costs when
compared to current farm policies,'' the report said.
   Some form of decoupling for American farmers has been advocated
unsuccessfully in Congress for several years. One example would be
to sign up farmers in a crop program and provide benefits without
tying them to specific acreage or production levels.
   As defined by the center _ a part of the independent, Washington
think tank, Resources for the Future _ decoupling would mean
``providing government support to farmers in ways that do not
distort production, prices, consumption, resource allocation or
trade.''
   Multilateral decoupling would also eliminated worldwide trade
distortions and ``give the United States advantages on those
agricultural products now having a competitive edge,'' the group
said.
   Even unilateral decoupling was said to offer positive effects,
including: increased general economic efficiency, lower production
costs, greater competitiveness in international markets and
improved environmental quality.
   ``Consumers would also gain as prices dropped,'' the report
said. ``However, those sectors currently receiving the highest
levels of government support _ those primarily in sugar, dairy,
rice and wool _ would decline in size.''
   The report added: ``Livestock and feed grain sectors, on the
other hand, would be least affected by decoupling because of their
already favorable competitive position in world markets. The
effects on government and taxpayers remain uncertain, depending on
the magnitude of the transition payments made to disadvantaged
farmers.''
   Decoupling doesn't set well with some farm groups. The National
Farmers Union, for example, says it is tantamount to putting
farmers on welfare by substituting direct federal payments for
price supports.
   A statement issued by NFU at its recent annual convention said,
``Farmers want federal program payments to help recover their cost
of producing food. These payments are actually subsidies to
consumers that pass through the hands of farmers.''

<HEAD>Congressmen Striving To Block Federal Money For Shopping Center</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three congressmen said Thursday they are
striving to block federal highway money for a shopping center to be
built adjacent to a major Civil War battlefield in northern
Virginia.
   Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., has introduced language into a
supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit federal
highway money from being used for road improvements near the
Manassas National Battlefield Park, 30 miles west of Washington.
   Developers plan to build a 1.2 million square-foot shopping mall
adjacent to the battlefield.
   Mrazek and other self-proclaimed Civil War buffs in Congress
said the project will violate the sanctity of the battlefield.
   ``The battlefield that helped shape the America we know today
should not be the sight of a Taco Bell or a Mattressland,'' said
Mrazek. ``We should not be building on top of a lot of Union and
Confederate soldiers who still lie today where they fell in
battle.''
   The battlefield is where two significant Civil War clashes were
fought, known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run, and called
the Battles of Manassas in the South.
   The first battle, fought on July 21, 1861, was the initial major
confrontation of the Civil War, and a surprising Confederate
victory helped convince Union officials that the war would be a
prolonged effort.
   The second battle, a bloody affair Aug. 29-30, 1862 that saw
24,000 casualties, was a costly victory for Confederate forces.
Union forces that had been as far south as Richmond two months
earlier were driven back into the nation's capital.
   Supporters of the development plan claim that the project will
not violate the battlefield, but Mrazek and Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, said the project will be built on the spot where
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had his headquarters for the second
battle.
   Mrazek's amendment, passed by the House Appropriations
transportation subcommittee, would block use of federal money for
highway projects needed to improve access to the rural battleground.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said Mrazek's plan is a stop-gap
measure intended to allow the Interior Department to use money from
a special fund to purchase and protect the 600-acre land parcel.
   ``The Congress is certainly acting in the national interest, so
that this hallowed land can be saved,'' said Vento, who chairs an
Interior and Insular Affairs panel that deals with national
parklands. ``This is an awkward but necessary move.''

   Secret Service agents and Canton police
confiscated a plastic gun from a high school student entering a
rally by Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson, police
said Thursday.
   Canton police Lt. Tom Thomas said the toy was a convincing
replica of a .357-caliber Magnum. He said the gun could not fire
ammunition, but could shoot plastic pellets.
   Thomas said the teen-ager had the gun in a knapsack, along with
books and school supplies, when he tried to enter the Canton Civic
Center.
   The unidentified youth was not held, but Thomas said the case
would be referred to the Police Department's Juvenile Bureau.
   Secret Service agents who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the teen-ager told them he forgot he had the plastic gun in his bag.

   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said
Thursday he won assurances from congressional leaders that they
will not derail U.S.-Canada free trade legislation out of pique
with President Reagan's plan to veto the omnibus trade bill.
   Mulroney, ending two days of meetings with administration and
Capitol Hill leaders, told reporters, ``I am leaving with the
assurance that congressional consideration will proceed on schedule
despite the uncertaintly surrounding the omnibus trade bill.''
   The schedule calls for Congress to put enabling legislation for
the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement on a ``fast track'' as soon as
the administration sends the bill to Congress, sometime after June
1.
   The agreement, hailed by Mulroney and Reagan as ``historic,''
provides for eventual elimination of tariffs and other steps to
stimulate what is already the world's highest-volume bilateral
trading relationship.
   The pact is separate from the overall trade bill adopted
Wednesday but there have been muted threats on Capitol Hill that
implementation of the U.S.-Canada pact eagerly sought by Reagan
might be slowed as a protest over his planned veto of the trade
bill.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, have
said they would not hold the Canadian accord ``hostage,'' and these
assurances were given to Mulroney in meetings on Thursday, the
Canadian leader said.
   In those discussions _ and in his second meeting with Reagan in
as many days _ Mulroney reasserted his plea that the United States
set specific timetables and targets for the reduction of acid rain,
which carries pollution and kills lakes and forests.
   ``I told the president what I told the leadership of the Senate
and the House: that a treaty on acid rain between Canada and the
United States is inevitable, just as surely as summer follows
spring,'' he said.
   The Reagan administration says more scientific investigation is
needed before it makes a commitment to specific clean-up goals.
   Mulroney said he and Reagan decided that Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
would give ``priority'' to discussions of an eight-point Canadian
plan for narrowing the differences, but he acknowledged the plan
contains the provisions already rejected by the administration.
   Still, he asserted that by airing the problem in Washington he
had advanced Canada's cause on the issue, and he reacted testily to
a news conference questioner's suggestion he was returning to
Ottawa empty-handed.
   ``Look it, we're looking at a very complex matter,'' he said.
``We're moving it forward, well see what happens. What do you do?
Do you declare war? Interrupt relationships? Or do you actively
work as I've been doing to persuade Americans of the value and
legitimacy of the Canadian position.''
   ``We were nowhere in 1980 and in 1984, and we're slowly but
surely trying to move it along,'' he said.
   Mulroney also confirmed reports from the United Nations earlier
this week that Canada would contribute personnel to a multinational
U.N. team that will observe the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Under the plan, Canada would provide about a half-dozen of the
50-member contingent, which would observe Soviet compliance with
its pledge to pull its estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan by
early next year.
   Mulroney said the decision to contribute was in keeping with a
traditional Canadian commitment to U.N. peacekeeping operations.
   The prime minister used his news conference to take a dig or two
at his political opponents at home.
   Asked if Reagan had expressed reservations about U.S.
willingness to let Canada buy submarines containing closely held
U.S. nuclear propulsion plants if the socialist New Democratic
Party gains power in the next election, Mulroney said: ``We dealt
with realistic matters.''

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Accuses US of `Imprudent' Statements</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition leader accused the
United States Thursday of ``imprudent and inconsiderate''
statements that interfere with South Korean politics.
   Prosecutors meanwhile arrested the former mayor of Seoul on
graft charges in the continuing investigation of alleged corruption
under the administration of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   About 1,500 students hurled firebombs during a demonstration
against the government and the ``economic aggression'' of the
United States in demanding freer markets for U.S. goods in South
Korea.
   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition party, told a news
conference the United States had supported the government of
President Roh Tae-woo, who succeeded Chun in February, because of
``selfish interests.''
   He said the United States interfered in South Korean politics by
receiving Roh on a visit shortly before the December presidential
election, expressing confidence that the election would be fair and
issuing a favorable report on South Korea's performance on human
rights.
   ``This is an imprudent and inconsiderate position,'' he said.
   Roh won the presidency with 36.6 percent of the vote. Opposition
support was split between Kim and his rival, Kim Young-sam.
   Former Mayor Yum Bo-hyun of Seoul, appointed by Chun, was
charged with peddling influence and taking bribes. Prosecutors said
a construction company offered Yum $160,000 and the former
president's younger brother Chun Kyung-hwan $270,000 in 1985 when
seeking a contract to build city parks.
   Chun's brother was charged March 31 with embezzling millions of
dollars.
   The corruption probe has been seen as part of Roh's effort to
distance himself from the authoritarian Chun government, which was
the target of huge public protests last summer.
   South Korea's three main opposition parties, which defeated the
government Democratic Justice Party in elections Tuesday and won a
majority in the National Assembly, accuse the Roh's administration
of exposing only part of the alleged corruption.
   They want the investigation expanded. The constitution that took
effect in February gives the National Assembly investigative powers.
   The three parties have ruled out a merger but are considering
ways to coordinate tactics in the assembly.
   Kim Jong-pil, head of the New Democratic Republican Party, has
proposed a liaison office. Kim Dae-jung, who leads the Party for
Peace and Democracy, and Kim Young-sam of the Reunification
Democratic Party said they would consider it.
   Of the 299 National Assembly seats, Kim Dae-jung's party has 71,
the followers of Kim Young-sam 59 and Kim Jong-pil, a former
conservative prime minister, 35. The government party has 125
seats. The other nine seats are held by smaller parties.
   In the student demonstration at Seoul National University,
protesters shouted ``Yankee go home!'' and demanded that the United
States end its pressure on South Korea for trade concessions.
   They also demanded removal of nuclear weapons they claim the
United States is storing in South Korea. The Pentagon will not
comment on whether it keeps nuclear weapons in this country.
   Students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, shouting
``Overthrow the dictatorship, which permits U.S. economic
aggression!'' Police responded with tear gas. No injuries or
arrests were reported.

   New opposition developed Thursday on Capitol
Hill to sending Coast Guard boats to the Persian Gulf, while the
Coast Guard commandant defended the proposal by saying it wouldn't
hurt anti-drug efforts at home.
   Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., introduced a measure in the House that
would ban use of the Coast Guard in the gulf.
   ``The Reagan administration should use the Coast Guard's scarce
resources to fight the war on drugs, not the Iran-Iran war,'' Lowry
said.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., told his colleagues it would be a
mistake to send lightly armed Coast Guard vessels into the war-torn
gulf.
   Lowry's proposal will be considered next week as an amendment to
a bill authorizing the Pentagon budget for the fiscal year starting
Oct. 1.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said the restriction ``will win in a breeze. It's no
contest.''
   The rising public fear about the nation's drug problems means
the restriction will win, Aspin explained. ``Taking the boats off
drug duty and putting them into the gulf won't be popular with the
public,'' he said.
   The Pentagon is considering sending six Coast Guard boats to
help Navy warships patrol the gulf. The Coast Guard vessels are
designed for shallow waters, and Navy officials say they could be
effective in the shallow gulf.
   The Navy is escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers, raising
fears in Congress that the United States might be drawn into the
Iran-Iraq war since Kuwaiti is an Iraqi ally.
   There have been several clashes between the Navy and Iran, the
most recent occurring April 18 when Navy ships and planes sank or
damaged six Iranian vessels.
   Adm. Paul A. Yost, Coast Guard commandant, told a Senate
subcommittee that he ``would be delighted'' to send the ships to
the gulf and said the move would have only ``a minimal impact'' on
anti-drug efforts.
   The boats are 110-foot ``Island'' class vessels, designed to
operate in waters off Florida and the Caribbean on anti-drug
patrols. The Coast Guard is buying 35 of the vessels, of which 17
have een delivered.
   The boats have a top speed of more than 26 knots, but their
heaviest weapons are machine guns. Pentagon officials had
considered sending the boats to the gulf last fall, but declined
because they are so lightly armed.
   Yost told the Appropriations transportation subcommittee the
boats would be replaced on anti-drug patrols by other Coast Guard
vessels and by some Navy ships.
   But earlier, Yost had been questioned about anti-drug efforts
and admitted, ``you can always use more'' money and boats.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., ``it seems to me we're going to hurt
our drug efforts'' by sending the boats to the gulf.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., was even more critical. ``I think
it's an incredible policy,'' he told Yost. ``We kind of bumbled our
way into this.''
   The Coast Guard is facing severe budget problems, Yost told the
subcommittee, including a $100 million shortfall in the current
fiscal year. More than 30 stations or facilities have been closed
and anti-drug patrols have been cut by 55 percent.
   Administratively, the Coast Guard is part of the Transportation
Department, but it also has national security responsibilities, and
the Navy has offered to pay the cost of sending the vessels to the
Persian Gulf, Yost said.
   Yost defended the plan. ``This is not an idea off the top of
somebody's head. It was well thought out and researched,'' he said.
   But Lowry saw it differently. ``Sending the Coast Guard to the
gulf would be just another tragic, dangerous and poorly conceived
move by the administration.''

<HEAD>CBS Cites Strike as Reason for Delaying Fall Season</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS said Thursday it is postponing its fall
television season by almost two months, and possibly longer,
because of a scriptwriters strike and the possibility of a second
strike this summer by craft workers.
   Network officials declined to comment Thursday beyond the
release of a brief statement sent from Thomas F. Leahy, president
of the CBS Television Network, to CBS-affiliated stations.
   The network, ranked third in the Nielsen ratings this season for
the first time in its history, had planned to begin its new fall
programming Sept. 5. However, it won't begin now until the end of
October, at the earliest.
   The other two networks have not yet announced details on when
their fall seasons would begin. The schedule at No. 1 NBC will
include the Summer Olympics, beginning Sept. 16, and the World
Series in late October.
   Although the strike had stopped production of 22 late-season
episodes of television series at the three networks, the CBS
postponement was the first real blow to the entertainment industry
by the 8-week-old job action.
   ``We've been predicting that CBS stood first in line to feel the
impact of the strike because of their early start date,'' said
Cheryl Rhoden, spokeswoman for the Writers Guild of America. ``This
is a good example of why the producers should return to the table.''
   The 9,000-member guild went on strike March 7 and no new
negotiations have been set. The contract dispute has focused
largely on residual payments for movies and TV programs shown
overseas and on residuals for hourlong TV shows sold into
syndication.
   Herb Steinberg, spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers, the studio bargaining unit, said CBS'
decision ``will result in an economic loss for the writers. The
bottom line is that we would like very much for the town to go back
to work.''
   In his message sent to CBS stations Wednesday night, Leahy said
that CBS Broadcast Group President Gene Jankowski stated that,
``given the continuing strike by the Writers Guild of America and
the uncertainty over the IATSE-Teamsters negotiations in the film
industry this summer, the previously announced Sept. 5 start date
for the 1988-89 season is no longer feasible.''
   ``We are looking forward to a new season start date at the end
of October 1988,'' the message said. ``Further details and an exact
start date will be forthcoming.''
   The contract of the International Alliance of Theatrical and
Stage Employees, which represents about 25,000 Hollywood
behind-the-camera production workers, expires expires July 31, said
IATSE spokesman Mac St. Johns.
   But St. Johns said: ``We are certainly not going to take the
blame for them delaying the start of their season. I suppose
there's always uncertainty when you go into negotiations, but no
more so now that in the past 100 years.
   ``Our president, Al Ditolla, has made it crystal clear that he
is not going into these negotiations with the idea of going on
strike.''
   A Writers Guild strike also delayed the 1981-82 season for
several weeks. The year before, a strike by movie and television
actors in 1980 delayed the opening of that year's television season
for all three networks.
   Brandon Stoddard, president of ABC Entertainment, said last week
that he did not know when the ABC fall season would begin, although
the lineup was set to be announced on May 23.
   At NBC, spokesman Jay Michelis said Thursday, ``Our schedule is
OK so far. But it will all depend on how long the strike lasts. We
will announce our fall schedule on May 18.''
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC, has said that for all
intents and purposes NBC would not begin its fall schedule until
after the World Series.

<HEAD>HUD To Try Legislation To Cut Aid to Cities With Rent Control</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration will try through
legislation to cut off millions of dollars in federal aid to cities
with rent control, but a New York congressman said Thursday the
plan is sure to be defeated.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., released a letter from Samuel R.
Pierce Jr., secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which said
the administration would propose legislation for fiscal 1989 to
restrict rental rehabilitation grants to areas without rent control
laws.
   ``The restriction cannot go into effect until legislation has
been adopted by Congress and signed by the president,'' Pierce
wrote.
   Originally, the Office of Management and Budget had suggested
making the change through federal regulation. But HUD spokesman
Jack Flynn said his department ``has always maintained that it
would require legislation'' to change the grant program.
   ``The letter is a carefully worded admission of defeat,''
Schumer said Thursday of Pierce's comments. ``Administration
officials first tried to impose their callous plan through
regulation because they knew legislation to interfere with local
housing laws would stand no chance in Congress. Once they saw that
Congress would not let their regulation go into effect, they backed
off.''
   In January, budget documents prepared by OMB detailed a plan to
enact a federal regulation that would cut aid to cities with rent
control laws. The government distributes $200 million annually in
such funds, which are used for major repairs to correct violations
of building codes.
   More than 200 cities, including New York, Boston, Washington,
Los Angeles and San Francisco, have some form of rent control.
Schumer estimated that New York would lose $20 million under the
administration's plan.

   The winless Baltimore Orioles set an American
League record by losing their 21st straight game Thursday.
   The Orioles fell to the Minnesota Twins 4-2 on just six hits.
They went meekly but not neatly. Baltimore committed two errors,
and pitcher Mike Boddicker walked six and hit three batters.
   Baltimore broke the league record of 20 consecutive losses set
by the Boston Red Sox in 1906 and tied by the Philadelphia
Athletics in 1916 and 1943.
   On Wednesday, the hapless Orioles, who have yet to win a game
this season, set a major league record for the longest
season-opening losing streak, 14 games.
   The next record in line on the Orioles' march to misery is the
longest major league losing streak of 23 games, set by the 1961
Philadelphia Phillies. Baltimore begins a three-game series in
Chicago against the White Sox on Friday.
   Baltimore is the worst-hitting team in the majors at .201, and
has been outscored 129-44 this season.
   Boddicker, 0-5, lost for a team-record 10th straight time since
his last victory on Sept. 4.

<HEAD>House Votes To Ban Most U.S. Nuclear Weapons Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House clamped another arms control
restriction on the White House by voting 214-186 on Thursday to ban
all but the smallest tests of U.S. nuclear weapons.
   The vote was the third time in two days the
Democratic-controlled chamber approved arms control restrictions
opposed by President Reagan.
   Earlier in the day, the chamber rejected a proposal to ban all
final-stage tests of an anti-satellite weapon. But the Air Force
says it already has dropped development of the weapon because of
earlier congressional restrictions.
   The decisions came as the House worked on a bill authorizing the
Pentagon budget for the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1.
   All three arms control votes were essentially repeats of
restrictions added by the House last year to its Pentagon budget
bill.
   Meanwhile, the Senate Armed Services Committee finished work
Thursday on its version of a Pentagon budget bill. Even though that
panel also is controlled by Democrats, the administration's defense
program fared better in the committee than it did in the House
Armed Services Committee.
   For example, the only arms control restriction the Senate panel
approved was a ban on any tests of Reagan's Star Wars system that
would violate the ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   The House and Senate bills both authorize $299.5 billion in
Pentagon spending for the next fiscal year, a figure set by last
December's budget summit between Reagan and Congress designed to
reduce federal deficits.
   Differences between the two measures will have to be reconciled
later by a House-Senate conference committee.
   In votes Thursday, the House:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Decided, on the 214-186 decision that went generally along
party lines, to ban all underground nuclear tests of weapons larger
than one kiloton. The decision came after the House passed, 399-0,
a Republican-backed amendment praising Reagan's effort to negotiate
limits on testing.
   The ban was voted last year by the House, but was dropped by the
House-Senate conference committee and ended up as only an advisory
request.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., told the House the ban would
``totally undercut our negotiators,'' a reference to the ongoing
U.S.-Soviet talks aimed at a comprehensive ban on all nuclear tests.
   But Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``We owe it to our
children'' to vigorously pursue a total ban on all atomic tests.
   Open-air atomic tests are banned by a 1963 treaty, but that pact
allows underground tests.
   _Rejected, 205-197, the anti-satellite ban proposed for a fourth
year by Rep. George Brown, D-Calif. But the panel also turned down,
212-195, a proposal to spend $100 million for development of a
ground-based anti-satellite weapon.
   The restriction had been imposed by Congress the past three
years and the Pentagon responded by dropping work on the program to
develop an ASAT weapon fired from a high-flying F-15 jet.
   Instead, the Air Force is working on different types of ASATs,
particularly those using ground-based lasers.
   Earlier in the week, the House had voted to ban any Star Wars
tests that would violate the narrow interpretation of the ABM pact.
It also voted to require continued compliance with numerical limits
in the unratified 1979 SALT II pact.
   ``The only restriction we added was the ABM intepretation
language,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel.
   The Senate panel recommended $4.6 billion for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. The bill on the
House floor provides $4 billion, although next week's scheduled
debate over SDI could mean changes in that total.
   Currently, SDI receives $3.9 billion and Reagan had sought $4.8
billion for the next fiscal year.
   The Senate measure also includes a proposal creating a Pentagon
commission which would determine unneeded military bases that could
be closed. No similar proposal is part of the House bill.
   The Senate bill also approved Reagan's request for a 4.3 percent
pay hike for America's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel.
The House measure proposes a 4 percent increase.

<TEXT>
   The federal prosecutor whose office indicted
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega and members of a violent
Colombian cocaine cartel will resign June 17 and rejoin his former
law firm, it was disclosed Thursday.
   U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, whose office is responsible for the
southern district of Florida, the nation's busiest in terms of
caseload, will resign for personal reasons, said his executive
assistant, Ana Barnett.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese has not named an acting U.S.
attorney for the district, which stretches from Key West to Vero
Beach.
   Kellner will rejoin the firm of Anderson, Baker, Kill and Olick
in Washington, D.C., Ms. Barnett said. He was in an all-day meeting
and unavailable for comment, she said.
   Kellner, 42, took the post in 1985, replacing Stanley Marcus,
who was appointed a U.S. District Court judge. Kellner come to the
office in 1982, working as chief of the civil division, then as
Marcus' executive assistant.
   In the 1987 fiscal year, federal records show, Kellner's
district handled 472 criminal trials. The next heaviest caseload
was 121 criminal trials in California's Central District, which
includes the Los Angeles area.
   Kellner's office indicted Noriega on Feb. 4, accusing him of
taking at least $4.6 million in payoffs from members of the
Medellin cocaine cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder
money, supply drug laboratories and shelter gang leaders from law
enforcement.
   The office also indicted members of the Medellin cartel, which
is accused of supplying 80 percent of the cocaine used in the
United States.
   Among those indicted were reputed leaders Jorge Ochoa, a
fugitive in Colombia, and Carlos Lehder Rivas, who is on trial in
Jacksonville. Several members of the cartel have been convicted.
   Kellner's office also prosecuted a corruption and drug-dealing
case involving members of the Miami Police Department.

<HEAD>Proposed Constitution For Hong Kong Could Limit Basic Freedoms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hong Kong-Chinese committee on Thursday
unveiled a proposed constitution for Hong Kong that guarantees that
China will not impose socialism for a 50-year period but contains
measures that could limit freedoms.
   The draft of the Basic Law promises freedom of speech, press,
assembly and religion. However, it says those rights may be
restricted in the thriving capitalist city when necessary to
maintain national security, public order, public health and morals.
   Another measure gives China's Communist Party-controlled
legislature, the National People's Congress, final power to
interpret and amend the Basic Law.
   Under a 1984 pact, Hong Kong will revert to Chinese sovereignty
in 1997 when Britain's 99-year lease on the bulk of the territory
expires.
   Hong Kong delegate Martin Lee, who believes the draft violates
the spirit of the 1984 Chinese-British agreement promising Hong
Kong substantial autonomy, said the matter is in the hands of the
Hong Kong people.
   ``If it becomes clear to everybody that the people of Hong Kong
want to have the democratic option and not an undemocratic one then
it's a political factor China has to take into account. I hope they
will,'' he said.
   ``If we don't speak with one voice then we are doomed to have an
undemocratic system,'' he said.
   Copies of the 59-page draft in Chinese and in English were to be
made available to Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents beginning
Friday at banks, subway stations and other public places.
   Sir David Wilson, Hong Kong's British-appointed governor, urged
residents to ``study the document very carefully.''
   The draft outlines procedures for establishing a semi-autonomous
system to govern the enclave as a ``special administrative region''
under China's ``one country, two systems'' policy, which permits
capitalism for 50 years. Hong Kong would have its own tax system,
courts, education system and social welfare organizations.
   Hong Kong residents have five months to comment on the proposed
constitution before the 58-member draft committee resumes
deliberations. A 177-member Basic Law Consultative Committee,
comprised of local civic leaders approved by China, will compile
the opinions.
   The consultative committee said it will also consider public
opinion poll results but does not plan to conduct its own surveys,
said vice chairman Lo Tak-shing.
   The consultative committee plans to hold seminars and some
Chinese officials are scheduled to visit Hong Kong in June and
September to talk to residents about the proposed Basic Law.
   A final version is expected to be approved in 1990 by China's
People's Congress.
   The draft committee, made up of 33 members from China and 25
from Hong Kong, debated the draft for 2{ years.
   ``As a whole it (the draft) is not really a bad job, although if
we had more time it could be better,'' ssaid Liu Yiuchu, a Hong
Kong lawyer and member of the draft committee.
   ``I made reservations about certain things that have not been
made clear in the draft,'' she said, including the relationship
between Hong Kong's courts and those on the mainland.
   The panel was unable to agree on several clauses.
   Instead, it issued multiple proposals on some issues, including
the selection of Hong Kong's post-1997 government. The draft
contains four alternate forumulas for electing a legislature.
   Hong Kong, made up of several islands and a strip of land along
China's southeastern coast, has been ruled by Britain since Queen
Victoria's navy wrenched it from declining imperial China in 1842.
   Most Hong Kong residents are ethnic Chinese, and many fled China
after the 1949 Communist takeover. Thousands have emigrated since
1984 because of fear of Communist rule, and many more say they may
do so, depending on how the Basic Law is worded.

   Sinhalese extremists killed at least
two people and set fire to a railway station as part of their
campaign to disrupt provincial elections on Thursday, police said.
   Voting was held for four of the nine provincial councils.
   Thirteen political parties boycotted the vote, saying general
elections should precede regional voting.
   More than 15,000 police were deployed in the four provinces,
where 2.8 million voters were eligible to select 155 council
representatives. The elections will help form autonomous regional
councils for the first time in Sri Lanka's history.
   When voting ended at 4 p.m. (6:30 a.m. EDT), turnout was
estimated at only 45 percent, an election official said.
   The People's Liberation Front, an underground, ultranationalist
Sinhalese organization, opposed the elections because they were
designed to give greater autonomy to the minority Tamils.
   Tamil guerrillas have fought since 1983 for an independent
homeland in the north and east. The Front says a peace accord
signed in July 1987 makes too many concessions to the Tamils, who
form 18 percent of the country's 16 million population and who
complain of discrimination.
   The Sinhalese community comprises 75 percent of the population.
   The accord was signed by Sri Lanka and India, which has a large
Tamil population in its southern region and is helping disarm the
rebels.
   Police officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
members of the Front set a railway station on fire at Nagolagama,
50 miles northeast of Colombo.
   At Yapahuwa, 25 miles farther north, a police constable was shot
and killed by two men on a motorcycle, police said. A voter was
killed at Wellawaya, 110 miles southeast of Colombo.
   At least three deaths earlier this month were blamed on the
People's Liberation Front, which the government accused of trying
to kill President Junius R. Jayewardene last August.
   First results of the voting are not expected until Friday.
   Thursday's elections were in the Northwestern Province, the
North-Central Province and the Uva and Sabaragamuwa districts in
the south.
   Jayewardene's governing United National Party; the opposition
United Socialist Alliance, an umbrella group of three leftist
parties, and the Sri Lanka Moslem Congress took part in the
elections.
   The Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the largest opposition party, was
among those boycotting the vote.

<HEAD>Senate Virtually Kills Extension of Amnesty for Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: EDITS top 2 grafs; COMBINES pvs; SUBS penultimate graf to

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday night virtually killed
any chance that Congress would vote to extend the May 4 deadline
for illegal aliens to apply for amnesty.
   The action came on a procedural vote to shut off debate by those
who oppose extending the amnesty to Nov. 30. Only 40 senators voted
to shut off the debate and 60 votes are needed to do so. Fifty-six
senators voted against shutting off debate.
   The Senate will be in recess when the deadline arrives next
Wednesday, so there is no chance that proponents of the extension
can try again.
   The House approved the extension on April 21 by a 213-201 vote.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had recommended a
presidential veto. If President Reagan followed the advice, his
veto likely would have been sustained.
   Immediately after the vote, Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., urged
all senators to tell their constituents: ``May 4 at midnight is the
final time for application for amnesty and they must know that.
   ``This extraordinary act of grace will end May 4 when we are in
recess. This is it,'' Simpson said.
   The immigration law enacted in 1986 was finely tuned legislation
that carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal aliens
with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented
workers.
   The Senate vote and the narrow House margin demonstrated that
amnesty for those who came to this country illegally before Jan. 1,
1982 remains an emotional issue.
   Aliens who came to this country illegally before 1982 and have
lived here continually since then were given one year to apply for
temporary residency as the first step toward permanent status. May
4 ends the one-year period.
   Immigration offices will remain open until midnight on
Wednesday. The INS already has begun a program that allows people
to sign up now and produce the necessary documentation later.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, speaking for senators opposing the
extension, said that illegal border crossings _ which dropped after
the new law was passed _ have increased greatly in recent months.
   ``After an initial period when the law was taken seriously, the
level of illegal immigration has risen by 60 percent over the last
year,'' he said. ``When people are asked why they are coming, they
say they don't believe the law is going to be enforced.''
   Gramm added that the Border Patrol is finding a large increase
in the use of false documents by illegal aliens.
   He said the extension proposal is ``fueling the fire that is
already sending millions of people across our borders illegally.''
   Gramm said that Reagan would have vetoed the bill and that veto
would have been sustained. He warned before the vote that the
extension bill would raise false hopes and illegal aliens who
waited past the May 4 deadline would ``lose the opportunity to get
the best gift America has _ to be in the United States legally.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. speaking for the extension,
said, ``It's hard to comprehend the intense opposition that some
senators are bringing to this issue.''
   He said ``of all the people in America,'' illegal aliens ``are
the least likely to know their rights. But they do have rights.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., also backed the extension,
commenting, ``We have little to lose and much to gain by extending
the application period.''
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said the extension should be passed
because ``This game started late. The effort by the INS, however
well intended, has not been sufficient. There are people who are
eligible, but timid.''
   But Simpson, the chief sponsor of the 1986 law, carried the day,
commenting that with some 1.3 million applications so far, the
legalization program is working. Applications have been approved at
about a 95 percent rate.
   ``If you want to live your dream, here's your chance,'' he said.
``It will never come again.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell Thursday from Ohio to New England, where the downpour
pushed streams to the tops of their banks, and temperatures plunged
in Missouri and Arkansas.
   Wet snow fell in higher elevations of western and central
Pennsylvania and eastern West Virginia.
   In New England, the heaviest rain fell in Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In six hours, Providence, R.I., got
1.82 inches of rain and Fort Devens, Mass., 1.10 inches.
   More than an inch and a quarter fell in Connecticut at Hartford
and Bridgeport in 24 hours.
   Small streams and rivers rose to the tops of their banks in the
Providence area. Low-lying areas along the Woonasquatucket River in
downtown Providence were threatened with flooding if the rain
continued.
   Rain also was reported across much of the upper Ohio Valley,
with wet snow across parts of the mountain areas of Pennsylvania.
Johnstown, Pa., reported snow Thursday afternoon.
   Rainshowers were scattered over coastal Washington and Oregon as
a cold front off the Pacific Northwest moved slowly eastward. Rain
also was scattered over parts of the northern California coast.
   Scattered rainshowers dampened eastern Arizona and extreme
western Texas.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.82 inches at Providence, R.I; 0.63 inch at Glens Falls,
N.Y.; and Parkersburg, W.Va.; 0.56 inch at Quillayute, Wash.; 0.55
inch at Lebanon, N.H., and 0.48 inch at Hartford, Conn.
   Temperatures rose to the 60s in the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley, with the exception of southeast Minnesota,
where temperatures were in the middle 40s because of snowcover.
   Kansas City International Airport had a record low of 34
degrees, and Calico Rock, Ark., tied its record of 32 degrees.
   Temperatures at 2 p.m. EDT ranged from 37 degrees at Elkins,
W.Va., to 91 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla. The nation's morning low
was 21 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Friday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the central and southern Plains across Texas, most numerous
across western and southern Kansas; rain from the upper Ohio Valley
through New England; and rainshowers scattered across the Pacific
Northwest and northern Plateau, most numerous over the Washington
and Oregon coast.
   High temperatures were expected to climb into the 60s or 70s
across much of the nation, with readings in the 50s from the
eastern Great Lakes through the upper Ohio Valley into southern and
central New England and in the Pacific Northwest, in the 40s from
western New York through the higher elevations of western
Pennsylvania into West Virginia and across northern New England, in
the 80s from northwest Montana through North Dakota and from the
desert Southwest through the southern Plateau, much of Texas and
the Gulf Coast into central and southern Florida.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Lendl Olympic Bill, But There May Be No Room On
Team</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday
approved legislation designed to make tennis star Ivan Lendl an
American citizen in time to play for the U.S. Olympic team in Seoul
this summer.
   But a spokesman for the U.S. Tennis Association said the team
members already have been selected and it is unlikely a player
would be bumped to make room for Lendl even if the Czech native
receives U.S. citizenship and clears another series of procedural
hurdles to become eligible.
   ``This would put us in a very difficult situation,'' said Ed
Fabricius, director of communications for the association. ``I
don't see it happening. We've already selected the team.''
   The committee's voice vote came one week after a House
immigration subcommittee, which traditionally opposes Olympic-tied
exemptions, agreed to the measure.
   The bill would waive for Lendl the five-year period permanent
residents are required to wait before receiving citizenship.
   Lendl, 28, the world's No. 1-ranked tennis player, is a native
of Czechoslovakia, but has lived in Greenwich, Conn., since 1981
and has adopted the United States as his home.
   Two other potential Olympic athletes also won committee approval
for fast-track citizenship. Jens-Peter Burntd is an East German
swimmer who defected in 1985 and is living in Alabama. Gagik
Barseghian is an Armenian wrestler who moved to California in 1986.
   If the citizenship bill is enacted, Lendl would have to
represent the United States in the Davis Cup in July to be eligible
for the Olympics. And since he has previously represented
Czechoslovakia in Davis Cup competition, he would have to secure a
waiver from the International Tennis Federation.
   After that, the Czech Olympic Committee would have to give Lendl
a waiver to play in the Olympics.

   A Politburo member went to a huge steel
plant where half the workers were on strike Thursday, but there was
no sign of an end to Poland's worst labor trouble since the
Solidarity days of 1980-81.
   Police detained three senior Solidarity leaders and an organizer
of another strike set for Friday in Stalowa Wola, said members of
the independent union federation, which was born in 1980 and
outlawed after the Communist authorities declared martial law in
December 1981.
   Bronislaw Geremek, an adviser to Solidarity founder Lech Walesa,
said police stopped his car in Stalowa Wola in the southern
industrial belt and detained him, Solidarity spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz and Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak. He said
Onyszkiewicz and Bujak remained in custody.
   Ewa Kaberna, a Solidarity activist who announced plans for the
strike at the 18,000-worker heavy machinery plant, was apprehended
by police on the street, said Solidarity spokesmen Zbigniew
Romaszewski in Warsaw.
   Politburo member Alfred Miodowicz visited the Lenin steelworks
works at Nowa Huta, outside Krakow about 65 miles southwest of
Stalowa Wola.
   His trip coincided with a warning to strikers that their
3-day-old work stoppage was illegal, and a breakdown in talks
between management and an unofficial strike committee.
   State television gave the strike prominent attention Thursday
night, saying it was against the law and talks had begun with the
plant's official union.
   Miodowicz told reporters Deputy Prime Minister Zbigniew Szalajda
was on his way to Nowa Huta. Strikers said later they were told
Szalajda had arrived, but the leader of the plant's official union
denied it.
   Workers expressed anger that management began talks Thursday
with the government-sanctioned union. Several hundred students
rallied in support of the strikers but police dispersed them.
   The strike at the 32,000-worker Nowa Huta plant is the biggest
in Poland since those that swept the country after food price
increases in 1980, which brought down a government and led to the
imposition of martial law.
   Organizers said at least 16,000 people had stopped work at the
plant in Nowa Huta, whose name means New Steel Mill. The town was
built in the 1950s as a model socialist community.
   About 12,000-14,000 strikers were said to be inside the plant.
They were able to go in and out, and some went home to rest.
   Workers who strike in Poland customarily go to their place of
employment, but instead of working they hold meetings, pass out
pamphlets or even sleep.
   Demands at Nowa Huta include an immediate 50 percent increase in
average monthly pay of $105. The unofficial strike committee also
said $15 paid monthly in compensation nationwide for recent price
increases should be doubled for industrial workers, teachers,
health care workers and retirees.
   Prices in Poland rose 42 percent in the first three months of
1988 because of government reductions in subsidies on many consumer
items.
   ``We are still waiting in vain for a proposal to meet the mill
management'' again, Stanislaw Handzlik, a dismissed Solidarity
activist, said Thursday evening. ``We feel it is a test of nerves
at the moment.''
   He said by telephone from the plant that force might be used
against the strikers.
   Miodowicz, who met Western reporters by chance, said when asked
about the comment: ``I don't think that will be necessary.''
   Handzlik and other strikers said later they were told by
management that Szalajda, the chief government official for
industrial policy, was holding a ``crisis staff meeting'' with
management. Wladyslaw Sitkowski, head of the official union at the
plant, said Szalajda was not there.
   A report by the official news agency PAP said Szalajda was
meeting with steel company executives in nearby Katowice ``to
discuss the possibility of changing the production structure'' in
the metals industry.
   Involvement of two such senior officials would indicate deep
official concern about the strike only days before May Day, the
international Labor Day that is a time of official celebration and
anti-government protest in Poland.
   At Stalowa Wola, factory officials confiscated the work passes
of some employees in an attempt block the strike, called to begin
at 7 a.m. Friday, Romaszewski said in Moscow.
   Negotiations with the official union at Nowa Huta appeared to be
an effort to seize the initiative from an unofficial 16-member
committee formed when the strike began Tuesday.
   ``The crew reacts with outrage,'' Handzlik said from the plant.
``Proposals put forth by the official unions are very vague and pay
issues are almost put off indefinitely.''
   The last talks with the strike committee took place early
Thursday, soon after midnight, and lasted only 15 minutes, strikers
said. They reported threats that failure to reach agreement could
lead to police intervention.

<HEAD>U.S. Banning Imports Of Elephant Ivory From Burundi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is banning imports of
elephant ivory originating from stockpiles in Burundi no matter
where they may be shipped from, the Fish and Wildlife Service said
Thursday.
   To bolster international efforts to save endangered African
elephants, other countries are being asked to take similar action
against a Burundi stockpile of ivory believed harvested by poachers
in other countries, said spokesman David Klinger.
   Burundi is a Maryland-sized central African nation without wild
elephants of its own. Although ivory shipments from Burundi in
violation of treaties could not be accepted by the United States,
without Thursday's action there would be no legal bar to
importation of carved or otherwise worked items made in third
countries from ivory shipped from Burundi.
   Swiss-based officials of the Convention on the International
Trade in Endangered Species and others sources have confirmed that
about 16,000 tusks or 94 tons of ivory have accumulated under
private ownership in Burundi, Klinger said.
   The ivory was accumulated before Burundi last November banned
imports outside of the convention, and officials there say they
have no legal way to prevent export of the material.
   ``We don't want this ivory in international trade,'' said
Klinger. ``Because Burundi has no wild elephants and no
ivory-producing country has authorized exports to Burundi since the
control system began in December 1986, Fish and Wildlife Service
law enforcement officials believe this stockpile was obtained
illegally.''
   Burundi is not one of the 95 nations that have signed the
convention and has been used as a shipping point by people trying
to get around quotas on ivory from elephants killed in other
countries, said Klinger.
   The neighbors of Burundi _ Zaire, Rwanda and Tanzania _ do have
elephants, which have been severely threatened by poaching and loss
of habitat. From an estimated 1.5 million animals 10 years ago, the
population has fallen to about 760,000.
   For this reason, nations with elephants have agreed on quotas
for ivory shipments, and a registration and tracking system for
tusks taken according to the quotas. Burundi cooperates in the
quota system and banned non-treaty imports of ivory last November,
but says it has no legal way to act against ivory imported before
that.
   When registration began on Dec. 1, 1986, 18,148 tusks totaling
98.6 tons were listed by Burundi. Such previously accumulated
inventories were exempt and could be sold, and the tusks went to
carvers in Hong Kong.
   The current stockpile is not registered with the convention.
   About 770 to 900 tons of ivory are traded every year. Tusks are
worth about $50 million and carved items $500 million or more,
Klinger said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of demonstrators set up
flaming barricades on the streets of the capital Thursday in a
protest calling for the ouster of military strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Hours before the demonstration, government security agents
arrested 30 people in a crackdown on opposition activists. Others
were being sought by police.
   Attorney General Carlos A. Villalaz told a news conference those
arrested were planning a three-day campaign of violence which he
said may have included tampering with two locks of the Panama Canal.
   Among those arrested was Enrique Marquez, president-elect of the
Panama Canal Society of Professional Engineers.
   In a statement, the society called it ``one more proof of the
constant violation of human rights by the Defense Forces of the
Republic of Panama.''
   Riot police lobbed tear-gas canisters and fired birdshot into
the air to break up small pockets of demonstrators on the Via
Espana, a main thoroughfare in Panama City. Barricades of burning
tires, garbage and boxes blocked some side streets.
   Several arrests were reported.
   The protesters, some on balconies high above the burning
rubbish, chanted, ``Get Out, Noriega!'' ``Justice!'' and ``Down
With Pineapple Face!'' _ a derogatory reference to Noriega.
   ``We are civilistas and we want democracy and justice in
Panama!,'' shouted a middle-age woman. Civilistas refers to
supporters of the National Civic Crusade, which has organized
protests against Noriega since June.
   The demonstration, however, was not the large-scale turnout
hoped for by the opposition.
   The protest started on Via Espana in the heart of an upper-class
shopping district, not far from many of the banks that make up this
city's international financial center.
   Merchants shuttered windows as a precaution against violence.
   Truckloads of police and riot troops patrolled streets and a
water cannon was used to discourage protesters.
   The U.S. Southern Command on Thursday urged U.S. servicemen and
their dependents in Panama to stay out of public places where
demonstrations might occur.
   Noriega is chief of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces and
the power behind the government.
   The crackdowns came as a U.S. State Department official was
reported to be meeting with the Panamanian general, who has been
indicted on drug-trafficking charges in the United States. Noriega
denies the charges.
   Michael Kozak, an aide to Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams, returned to Panama for the second time in two weeks, said a
source in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Reagan administration officials reportedly have been seeking
more subtle ways to get Noriega to step down after failing to
dislodge the general with sweeping economic sanctions. The
sanctions have created a severe cash shortage in Panama.
   On Thursday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater suggested
the Reagan administration would be satisfied if Noriega resigns as
head of the country's military forces. Previously, U.S. officials
insisted that Noriega leave Panama.
   None of the people arrested Thursday were leaders of the Civic
Crusade.
   Villalaz said earlier the arrest order applied to 35 directors
of the Civic Crusade, plus an unspecified number of neighborhood
leaders of the planned demonstration.
   Villalaz said arrests were made after intelligence agents
uncovered an opposition plan that ``constituted a movement aimed at
carrying out acts of violence'' beginning Thursday.
   Weapons, documents describing how to make firebombs and papers
describing the workings of the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks of
the Panama Canal were found during raids Thursday, Villalaz said.
   Opposition activists want ``to find a formula through which the
functioning of the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks will be
affected,'' he said.
   Agents raided the offices of the Panama Industrial Association,
the Panamanian Odontological Association and the National Medical
Commission. All three organizations complained the raids were
carried out without proper warrants.
   Efforts to reach opposition leaders for comment were not
immediately successful. Many have been in hiding since their
headquarters in a Panama City hotel was raided March 28 after a
protest and more than 40 people were arrested.
   The Civic Crusade has been unable to attract enough support for
a major protest since the March rally was smashed by riot police.
   A federal judge in Miami ruled Thursday that Noriega could
challenge his indictment on drug-trafficking charges without
surrending himself to authorities. U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler gave Noriega's Miami lawyer 10 days to submit challenges
to the Feb. 4 indictment.

wildlife and threatening more Thursday.
   Larry Kolb, principal engineer with the state Regional Water
Quality Control Board, called the spill an ecological disaster and
estimated that it could cost Shell $3 million in penalties and $1
million in cleanup costs.
   About 100 cleanup workers Thursday were rushed into area
wetlands where winds and rising tides threatened to expand the
spill, which occurred during the nesting season 40 miles northeast
of San Francisco.
   The spill occurred Friday night or early Saturday when a
drainpipe that carries off rainwater through the middle of an oil
tank at Shell's major northern California refinery broke inside the
tank, allowing oil to be siphoned out.
   Shell said Wednesday that it regularly allowed rain collected
from the roof of the tank to flow uninspected into a nearby marsh.
   The practice violated federal Environmental Protection Agency
regulations, Shell's written policies and standard industry
practice, refinery manager Ron Banducci said.
   He said he had no explanation for the deviation from established
procedures and EPA requirements.
   ``While the investigation is continuing, the management of this
refinery takes full responsibility'' for the accident, Shell
spokesman Gene Munger said Thursday.
   The practice of discharging the storm water without inspection
was not followed at any of the 173 other tanks at the 1,000-acre
refinery, said Banducci.
   ``In our view, leaving the valve open when rain is predicted is
not control (of rain discharges) in any sense of the word,'' Kolb
said Thurssday.
   About 126,000 gallons of the San Joaquin crude, a particularly
thick oil, have been recovered from a 15-mile stretch along
Carquinez Strait and the Peyton Marsh, which adjoins the refinery.
   Crews raced to remove the oil, much of it stuck to rocks and
marsh reeds, before rain or an exceptionally high tide of 5.5 feet
due on Saturday can spread it.
   High tides and gusty winds late Wednesday pushed up to 1,600
gallons of oil out of the marsh into the waters of Suisun Bay, to
the east, and Carquinez Strait, northeast of the San Francisco Bay,
said Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze.
   State Fish and Game Department officials flew over Ryer and Roe
islands about six miles from the spill and found ``lots of birds,
lots of oil.''
   ``Some of the oil has gotten into areas where it wasn't before,
primarily the nesting areas out there, and that's bad for sure,''
said Brian Hunter, fish and game regional manager.
   By Thursday morning, 447 oily birds and animals had been picked
up from polluted areas, said Hunter. Of those, 189 were either dead
or died during the rescue. The animals included 32 mammals and
eight reptiles.
   Kolb said damaged areas may take a year or more to recover.
   On Wednesday, wildlife crews blasted gas-powered cannons to
frighten birds from nesting marshes and set up ``zon'' guns,
propane gas-powered cannons, to scare birds away from fouled areas.
   About 50 members of the California Conservation Corps were sent
to help clean up the Martinez Marina, where some 400 boats were
trapped in the harbor. Many belonged to fishermen upset they would
miss this weekend's fishing.
   Most of their boats had oil stains on the hulls, and by federal
regulations must be cleaned before being allowed out of the marina.
   Salmon season opens Sunday, and steelhead are spawning in the
Sacramento River.

   A spectacular, 2{-mile cavern kept secret
for 14 years to prevent vandalism will become the newest natural
tourist attraction in the state that's home to the Grand Canyon and
the Petrified Forest.
   The Legislature and Gov. Rose Mofford rushed Wednesday to enact
legislation allowing the state to acquire the cavern. Mrs. Mofford
perched a spelunker's helmet atop her beehive hairdo as she signed
the bill adopted an hour earlier.
   Until now, only a select few have squeezed through the tiny
opening to see the cavern near Benson, in southeastern Arizona
about 50 miles from Tucson.
   State Parks Board Director Kenneth Travous predicted Wednesday
that when the cave is opened to the public in about three years,
100,000 to 150,000 people a year will travel by elevator to see it.
   ``It's fabulous,'' Travous said. ``Walt Disney couldn't have
done any better for the state of Arizona. Your imagination goes
crazy when you get down there.''
   The cave, discovered in 1974, is about 13,000 feet long and from
50 to 100 feet high inside.
   Thousands of still-growing stalagmites and stalactites ranging
in size from several inches to 60 feet are found throughout the
two-room cave, which is home to a colony of 700 bats.
   Parks Department spokeswoman Cheryl Steenerson said the cavern
is considerably smaller than the famous Carlsbad Caverns in New
Mexico, which are among the world's largest at 100,000 feet in
length.
   The national Cave Research Foundation gave 68 points to the
quality of the Arizona caverns's formations and rated it as a
national-class cave; Carlsbad received 100 and is rated world-class.
   Officials plan to use state park revenues to acquire the site
for $1.6 million within a year from the Arizona Nature Conservancy,
which soon will buy it from the family of the late James Kartchner,
a rancher and educator.
   The cave had been a closely held secret since it was discovered
because of fear that vandals would destroy its beauty.
   ``It's very colorful,'' said Randy Tufts, 39, who with Gary
Tenen, 37, who first came across the cavern. ``The variety of
formations is very wide.''
   Rep. Gus Arzberger, in whose district the cave lies, said he had
``walked over this thing I don't know how many times hunting deer''
but never realized its existence.
   One of Kartchner's sons, Dean, said family members were aware of
the sinkhole on their land.
   ``We climbed in it, there were rattlesnakes, and we climbed back
out (with) no idea of the magnificence of the structure,''
Kartchner said.

   Legislation to bridge the gap between the
pending medium-range missile reduction treaty and a future pact to
make deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms was introduced in the
Senate Thursday.
   The bill calls for temporary mutual limits on U.S. and Soviet
deployment of long-range strategic arms until the negotiation of a
new Strategic Arms Reduction or START treaty.
   The legislation declares that the two superpowers should not
exceed the levels of specified nuclear weapons they had in the
field on Jan. 25, 1988, the date the medium-range accord was
submitted to the Senate.
   Both nations would have to agree on such limitations before they
could take effect.
   The bill was introduced by Sens. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; and John Heinz, R-Pa.
   Bumpers said that both supporters and opponents of the pending
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty agree that the
military advantages of the pact to the United States and its allies
can be overcome by the Soviets if Moscow deploys additional
long-range weapons to make up for the medium-range missiles it will
be required to destroy.
   ``Our legislation provides guidelines for temporary mutual
restraints to reinforce the INF treaty until we get a strategic
arms agreement,`` Bumpers said.
   Leahy added: ``Unless we stop or slow deployment of new Soviet
strategic missiles, the INF treaty will be a dead letter.''
   ``Without any cap on intercontinental missiles, the Soviets will
simply add more strategic warheads to cover the same NATO targets
once covered by the SS-20 intermediate-range Soviet missiles,''
Leahy said.
   Leahy said it is now clear that no agreement will be reached on
a START treaty at the Moscow summit meeting in late May between
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   By calling for an interim freeze on multiple warhead missiles
and bombers, the legislation will maintain the viability of the INF
treaty pending the achievement of a more far-reaching START treaty,
he said.
   Chafee said the treaty will protect the advances made by the INF
treaty and improve chances of reaching agreement on cuts in
long-range arms.

<HEAD>Drug Chain Balks After City OKs Parental Leave Requirement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rite Aid Corp. has canceled its plan to
construct an international headquarters here after the city council
approved an ordinance requiring companies to offer unpaid leave to
new mothers and fathers.
   The decision by Rite Aid, one of the nation's largest drugstore
chains, comes as state legislators begin to review several bills to
impose similar requirements statewide. Parental leave legislation
is also being considered on the federal level.
   Suzanne Mead, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, said the company did
not object to specific provisions of the city ordinance. The
concern of company officials, she said, is that Harrisburg was
entering an area ``traditionally covered on federal and state
levels.''
   The Harrisburg ordinance, approved by the city council Wednesday
in a 5-2 override of the mayor's veto, would allow a mother or
father to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave after the birth of a
child.
   Supporters of the requirement say it would strengthen families
while protecting the jobs of workers who want to take an extended
absence. But business groups are concerned such restrictions will
interfere with existing benefits and hamper the business climate.
   A spokeswoman for Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed, a Democrat,
said the city may take legal action to block its provisions.
   ``Obviously it's a severe blow to us. It's 1,300 jobs,'' said
spokeswoman Julia Marshall. The city, Pennsylvania's capital, has a
population of about 55,000.
   Rite Aid, with 28,000 employees worldwide and a number of
facilities in suburban Harrisburg, planned to move 735 jobs into
the new headquarters and add 100 more jobs a year for the following
three years. In addition, the project would have created
construction jobs.
   City officials said they knew of no other city that has imposed
such a law, but at least 10 states guarantee some form of parental
leave, and legislators in Pennsylvania are considering such a law.
   Reed is against the ordinance, Ms. Marshall said, because ``it
singles out Harrisburg _ one municipality _ and it will be
detrimental to the business climate which has been improving in the
last three or four years.''
   City council President Reizdan B. Moore said the bill's
suporters are ``not anti-business. We're pro-business,
pro-development, pro-people, pro-everything.''
   But councilwoman Sherri D. Levin said the bill is
``anti-Harrisburg.''
   Even the five members of the city's Human Relations Commission,
which must enforce the law, wrote the council a letter urging that
the Reed's veto be sustained. They said the law would lead to
increased discrimination for both young men and women who are
interested in starting a family.
   Some residents who supported the bill said they were enraged by
Rite Aid's threatened cancellation.
   ``If you don't pass this, you might as well put a sign up ...
that says, `Rite Aid Plantation,'' said Claire Jones, one resident.
``I'll tell you this: I won't pick cotton here.''
   Ms. Mead said Rite Aid had a parental leave policy she described
as ``attractive,'' but would not discuss its specific provisions.
   ``We're responding not to the issue, but (to) the right of a
municipality to impose such a policy on a local corporation,'' Ms.
Mead said.

<HEAD>Cubans Shoot Down Own Aircraft, Killing 26 Cubans, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban troops on alert for enemy planes
accidentally shot down one of their own aircraft in southern
Angola, killing a brigadier general and 25 other military
personnel, the Cuban military said Thursday.
   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, in a dispatch monitored in
Mexico City, quoted a military communique as saying the ``error of
Cuban rocket defense'' took place Wednesday morning as the AN-26
transport plane approached the airport at Tchamutete.
   The Cuban plane's trip had been announced previously.
   The airport's anti-air defense was on a high state of alert
because several enemy planes had been spotted in the area, the news
agency said.
   The communique said that one of the rocket installations on
alert fired on the plane as it approached.
   Thousands of Cuban troops are in Angola helping the Marxist
government fight an insurgency backed by the United States and
South Africa.
   The general who was killed was identified as Brig. Gen.
Francisco Cruz Bourzac, the deputy minister for armaments and
technology. He also was a member of the Cuban Communist Party's
Central Committee and a hero of the thwarted Bay of Pigs invasion
of Cuba in 1961, the news agency said.
   It said that Col. Jorge Izquierdo Quinones and a group of
anti-aircraft specialists headed by Lt. Col. Carlos Camilo Alvez
also were traveling on the plane.
   Ministry communiques on the fighting in Angola are rarely
carried by Prensa Latina.
   Prensa Latina reported in January that about 40,000 Cuban troops
are in Angola.

<HEAD>Engineered Antibody Cures Diabetes In Laboratory Mice, Says
Researcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An engineered antibody developed to attack a
type of immune cell in the body has been shown to cure laboratory
mice of diabetes, a California researcher said Thursday.
   Dr. C. Garrison Fathman of the Stanford University Medical
Center said that in an experiment that has lasted for more than a
year his team demonstrated that a special monoclonal antibody could
block the destructive action of a T-cell lymphocyte that is thought
to play a role in causing diabetes.
   Fathman said the antibody was used in a laboratory animal called
the nonobese diabetic mouse. This type of mouse normally develops
diabetes and is bred to enable researchers to study the disease.
   Normally, he said, the mice of this strain develop diabetes
within 150 days and die within a short time.
   But in the Stanford experiment reported in the journal Science,
mice treated with the monoclonal antibody were cured of diabetes
and all but three have lived for 450 days. Two control groups of
mice that were part of the experiment died of diabetes after
receiving either none of the antibody or small doses, said Fathman.
   The scientist said that although the research is promising, it
does not offer any immediate hope of curing diabetes in humans.
Fathman said the technique must undergo studies in primates before
it could be applied to humans even on an experimental basis.
   Furthermore, Fathman said the treatment would never be
appropriate for patients who already have diabetes because by then
``the disease has gone too far in the destructive process.''
   The monoclonal antibody used in the research was developed to
attack a type of lymphocyte that has on its surface a protein
called the L3T4 marker. When injected, the antibody will seek out
and kill cells with this marker.
   Lymphocytes with the L3T4 marker are thought to be the pilot
cells in an attack on the pancreas, the organ that secretes
insulin. This lymphocyte is thought to start a cascade effect that
results in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas being
destroyed by the body's own immune system. Once the beta cells are
destroyed, the body can not produce insulin, a hormone essential
for the metabolism of sugar.
   Fathman said his team used three groups of the nonobese diabetic
mice. One group received none of the monoclonal antibody. A second
group received one large dose of the antibody. The third group
received a large dose, plus smaller weekly doses.
   The experiment began when the mice were 90 to 110 days old. At
that point, said Fathman, the destructive process that leads to
diabetes was well started, with the beta cells of the pancreas
already under attack.
   By 260 days, 80 percent of both the untreated mice and the mice
which received a single dose of the antibody were diabetic or dead.
Among the 25 mice that received weekly doses of the antibody, only
two were diabetic. Fathman said the treatment may have started too
late in the process for these two mice. A third mouse in the
treated group died later of other causes.
   All treatment was withdrawn 150 days after it started and the
fully-treated mice remain healthy.
   Fathman said in a telephone interview that the treated mice now
have passed the age of 450 days and are maintaining normal levels
of sugar in their blood, evidence that they are not diabetic.
   ``We clearly have prevented them from reverting to the diabetic
state,'' he said. ``They are cured.''
   Fathman and his co-workers reported on the experiment in
Science, the journal of American Association for the Advancement of
Science. The magazine was published Friday.

<HEAD>CIA Heads Off North Korean Attempt To Buy Computers, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea tried to buy hundreds of Japanese
computers through a company in Indonesia last month, but CIA agents
foiled the plan, a news agency said Thursday.
   The Kyodo News Service, quoting unidentified U.S. sources in
Singapore, also said CIA agents were monitoring North Korean trade
representatives in Singapore to block possible terrorist actions at
the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
   Kyodo quoted the sources as saying CIA agents discovered in
March that 500 computers ordered from a Japanese trading company
for export to a company in Jakarta, Indonesia, were destined for
communist North Korea.
   The news agency said the CIA notified Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry through diplomatic channels, and
the ministry subsequently denied the trading company an export
permit for the computers.
   Kyodo said the names of the companies involved were not
available.
   Japanese trade ministry and Foreign Ministry officials said they
could not comment on the reports of CIA or North Korean involvement.
   They said a distributor for Japan's NEC Corp., a major computer
maker, had received an order from a small company in the western
city of Kobe for 500 to 600 personal computers.
   The Kobe company had received an order for the computers from a
small Japanese trading company in Tokyo, which in turn had received
an order from a firm in Singapore, the ministry officials told The
Associated Press. They spoke on condition they not be identified.
   They said NEC's distributor canceled the deal before an
application was made to the trade ministry for an export permit.
   An NEC spokesman, Seiji Igarashi, confirmed an NEC distributor
had received an order last fall from a Japanese trading company for
about 500 personal computers. He said the distributor canceled the
deal this spring when it could not confirm the ultimate source of
the order.
   Japanese companies and government officials have tightened their
monitoring of high-technology exports to communist countries since
a Toshiba Corp. subsidiary was found last year to have violated
Japanese and international trade regulations by selling
sophisticated metal milling machines to the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Regulators Urged To Dissolve FADA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee on
Thursday called on federal regulators to dissolve within 60 days a
much-criticized agency created 2{ years ago to sell property from
insolvent savings institutions.
   After meeting with Democratic members of the committee, Rep.
Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., decided to send a letter to Federal
Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall calling for the speedy
abolishment of the Federal Asset Disposition Association, said a
committee spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Two members of the committee, Rep. Thomas McMillen, D-Md., and
Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., are drafting legislation to dismantle
FADA should Wall refuse to comply, the spokeswoman said.
   Wall spokesman Karl Hoyle said the bank board, which regulates
3,147 federally insured savings institutions, is unlikely to do
away with FADA.
   ``We'd be the first to admit there were problems, but we have
those problems under control. We've got new management at FADA and
we believe it should have an opportunity to prove itself,'' he said.
   In another development, the new chief executive of FADA, Gerald
P. Carmen, said the agency made its first quarterly profit during
the first three months of this year.
   ``We will be posting a net profit of $538,000 for the first
quarter. The loss last year was approximately $7 million and the
year before that $3 million,'' he said. ``I don't want to make more
of it than it is, but I think it is kind of a turning point.''
   The move to abolish FADA by House Democrats comes less than a
week after the release of a highly critical report by the Banking
Committee that charged FADA with being a ``bloated bureaucracy''
that wasted millions of dollars.
   The bank board created FADA in late 1985 by chartering it as a
private savings institution. Despite that structure, it functions
as an arm of the government and all of its stock is owned by the
insurance fund that backs S&L deposits. The insurance fund is also
FADA's only customer, paying it fees to manage loans and real
estate from insolvent S&Ls.

<HEAD>Defense Tries to Link Bush to Wedtech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys at the racketeering trial of
Rep. Mario Biaggi tried to link Vice President George Bush to the
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. on Thursday while cross-examining a
witness.
   The witness, former Wedtech executive Lawrence Shorten,
testified that he was told the company hired a distant relative of
Bush's as a management consultant partly ``because of his contact
with the vice president.''
   But Shorten denied that Charles Dickey Dyer III, related to Bush
by marriage, was hired to win Bush's support for Wedtech's
obtaining a multimillion-dollar Navy contract.
   Shorten also said he was told by a close friend of Attorney
General Edwin Meese's that Meese would have President Reagan
overrule the Navy if it did not give the contract to Wedtech, which
is now bankrupt.
   Steve Hart, a Bush spokesman, confirmed that Dyer is related to
Bush through marriage but said the vice president had nothing to do
with contracts.
   ``We have no records of any type of involvement or any action
involving Navy contracts that would suggest the vice president took
any position one way or another,'' Hart said.
   Hart said that Dyer ``did write the vice president five or six
letters.''
   But he added: ``The vice president either didn't respond to the
letters or in the cases where he did respond, they were very
cursory responses, `thanks for note, and so forth,' and alluded to
little if anything in the letters.''
   Shorten, one of four former top Wedtech executives who have
pleaded guilty to state and federal charges _ now cooperating with
the government in exchange for leniency _ said Wedtech was vying
with companies in Puerto Rico and Texas to win a Navy contract to
build floating docks, or pontoons, in 1984.
   He said that Bush supported the other companies, but he denied
an allegation by Biaggi's lawyer, James LaRossa, that Dyer was
hired ``to countermand the problems that George Bush was giving
Wedtech.''
   Shorten said he did not think the vice president's relative was
still working for the defense contractor in 1984, when the pontoon
contract was up for grabs.
   ``But you did get the contract, right?'' persisted LaRossa.
   ``Yes,'' said Shorten. Wedtech obtained the first of several
Navy pontoon contracts totaling more than $100 million in April
1984.
   In a telephone interview from his Princeton, N.J., home, Dyer
said that he stopped working for Wedtech in the fall of 1981 but
that payment for his consulting services was strung out until early
1984.
   Dyer said if Bush did anything on Wedtech's behalf ``I'm not
aware of it.'' He added: ``If they had any influence with George
Bush I didn't get it for them.'' Dyer said Bush's busy schedule has
kept them from speaking since 1980.
   Dyer also denied speaking or writing to Bush about Wedtech's
pontoon contract but said he did write the vice president at least
twice on the company's behalf about an Army engine contract in 1981.
   Biaggi, a New York Democrat, and six others are accused of
turning Wedtech, which is now bankrupt, into a racketeering
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain
no-bid government contracts.
   Defense lawyers have tried to show that Wedtech officials had
close links to high-ranking officials in the Reagan White House and
thus did not need the help of a Democratic congressman from the
Bronx.
   Shorten said Wedtech sought the help of such Washington insiders
as San Francisco lawyer E. Robert Wallach, a close friend and
former personal lawyer to Meese.
   ``You know sir,'' asked LaRossa ``that Wallach had an open door
to the White House through his buddy Ed Meese, right?''
   ``Yes, sir,'' said Shorten.
   ``He told you that didn't he?''
   ``Yes, he did,'' said Shorten.
   Later, LaRossa asked if Wallach had told Shorten ``that if the
Navy didn't give you, Wedtech, the pontoon contract, he would make
sure through Meese that the `old man,' Ronald Reagan, would
overrule the Navy and give it to you, right?''
   ``He did say that, yes,'' said Shorten.
   Wallach is under indictment on charges of taking payoffs from
Wedtech executives to influence Meese and other public officials.
Meese has not been charged with any wrongdoing.

   A wind-whipped fire raced through a

   Troops were sent to the area after residents, angry that
firefighters were not saving their homes, pelted firetrucks with
stones. The wood and cardboard shantytown had no fire hydrants and
officials said the roads were too narrow for the trucks.
   There was no immediate estimate of damage and the cause of the
fire was under investigation. The city's fire chief, Chief Brig.
Gen. Ernesto Madriaga, said the blaze was ``possibly the biggest in
Manila since World War II.''
   Four people were injured, including three civilians and a
fireman who was struck in the head by a water hose, Madriaga said.
   Firefighters controlled the blaze at 7:30 p.m., 4{ hours after
it began in the capital's crowded Pandacan district. Smoke
blackened the skies over much of the city Thursday afternoon.
   The fire threatened to spread to a government-owned petroleum
compound, but did not reach it because of a change in the wind.
   Hundreds of people huddled around collections of personal
belongings, including refrigerators, furniture and televisions
sets, on the sides of a narrow, mud-covered street separating the
smoldering shantytown from the petroleum compound.
   The fire broke out an hour after firefighters put out a blaze
that gutted the top floor of the nine-story, 60-room San Carlos
Apartment Hotel about two miles away.
   No one was injured in that fire, which officials said began in
an adjacent building under construction. The hotel's manager said
most of the 100 guests were out at the time.
   The government-run Philippine News Agency said 3,000 families,
or approximately 15,000 people, lost their homes in Pandacan, on
the banks of the Pasig River about 1{ miles from the presidential
palace.
   Madriaga estimated more than 1,000 dwellings in the 25-acre area
were destroyed along with a candy factory warehouse.
   Major oil companies such as Caltex, Shell and the
government-owned Philippine National Oil Co. have storage tanks in
the area.
   Madriaga's deputy, Col. Oscar Pascual, said the flames came
within eight yards of the oil complex.
   Firefighters said they could not use their firetrucks in the
shantytown and they concentrated on preventing the fire from
spreading to the oil depot.
   Antonio Santos, operations manager of the depot, said the
squatter area was ``too congested for even the best firefighters to
have been able to battle the flames very well.'' He said water had
to be pumped from hydrants within the oil compound.
   Mary Bayani, 27, whose home was destroyed, said she was
attending a Bible study class about 3 p.m. when she heard children
shouting ``Fire, fire.''
   After gathering her three small children, ``I saved our clothes
and some kitchen utensils,'' she said. ``But we have no rice and no
money.''
   ``We will stay here during the night,'' Mrs. Bayani added. ``But
I don't know what we will do tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Man in Athens Identified as Armenian Terrorist Chief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An assassination team of two masked men
fired blasts from a sawed-off shotgun Thursday to kill Agop
Agopian, the founder and leader of an Armenian terrorist group
feared throughout the world.
   Agopian, who posed as a Lebanese businessman in Athens but also
carried a South Yemeni diplomatic passport, was shot outside his
home in a prosperous seaside suburb.
   A statement by the Ministry of Public Order said the victim's
wife, ``during questioning by security police ... said he was the
leader of ASALA, Agop Agopian.''
   Police identified the wife as Janil Titizian and said she told
them her husband recently arrived from South Yemen and was on his
way to Yugoslavia. She said he was bound for the airport when
killed.
   ASALA, standing for the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation
of Armenia, has claimed numerous terrorist attacks against Turkish
targets, including the July 1983 bombing of the Turkish Airlines
desk at Paris' Orly Airport which killed eight people and wounded
56.
   The group seeks the foundation of an independent Armenian state
in eastern Turkey.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing.
   Agopian was killed outside his house in the Old Phaleron suburb
at 4:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday) as he waited for a taxi in
the street outside his home. With him was a woman identified as his
sister-in-law. She was unhurt.
   According to a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity in accordance with Greek practice, two armed men emerged
from a parked car.
   One man fired at Agopian, using solid shotgun slugs, the type
used in Greece for boar-hunting.
   Agopian, hit with two slugs in the chest and elbow, tried to
flee. The man ran after him and fired two more slugs into his head
and chest.
   The attackers got away in a car left parked across the street
from the second-floor apartment where Agopian and his wife lived.
   The victim was first identified as Abdul Mohammed Kashim, 39,
from a South Yemeni diplomatic passport he was carrying.
   But following reports from Paris saying the dead man was the
long-sought leader of ASALA, the ministry said his wife revealed
his real identity.
   ``He'd lived in Athens for at least a year, possibly longer, as
Henri Titizian, but he traveled abroad very frequently on the
Yemeni passport,'' said a police source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The source said Agopian planned to open a supermarket in Athens.
   Agopian, whose name has also been given as Hagop Hagopian, was
reported killed in an Israeli air raid on a Palestinian camp near
Beirut during Israel's 1982 summer invasion of Lebanon.
   But there were also reports that Agopian was still alive and
active in the terrorist organization he had founded, and had merely
changed identities.
   Armenian sources in Athens, speaking on condition of anoymity,
said Agopian was born in Iraq in 1945, and that his name was most
likely a pseudonym.
   ASALA, founded by Agopian in 1975, claimed responsibility for
more than 60 attacks on Turkish targets, including killings of
around 30 Turkish diplomats and dependents in Western Europe and
the United States.
   Agopian ran ASALA from Beirut with funding from the Palestine
Liberation Organization and leftist groups.
   Besides seeking the creation of an independent Armenian state in
Turkey, the Marxist-oriented organization vows to avenge a massacre
by Ottoman Turks in 1915-16 that it says left 1.5 Armenians dead.
   Both security police and ministry officials declined to say
whether a rival Armenian group could have been responsible for
killing Agopian.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported in Paris
that Thursday's killing may have been the work of the
ASALA-Revolutionary Movement, an Armenian commando group which
separated from the main organization.
   The head of that group, American archaeologist Monte Melkonian,
is serving a six-year term in French prison for criminal
association, weapons possession and forging identity papers.
   The ministry said security police were still questioning Mrs.
Titizian.
   A police source said Agopian ``apparently was selling off some
businesses in Lebanon and was transferring his activities to
Greece.''
   The police spokesman said Agopian was booked on an early morning
Yugoslav Airlines flight to Belgrade.

   A fire broke out in the crew quarters of
the USS Bonefish before the submarine was wracked by explosions and
fire that killed three crewmen, a survivor of the accident said
Thursday.
   The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of Sunday's
accident off the Florida coast, but civilian submarine experts have
said the explosion could have been connected with a buildup of
hydrogen gas in the battery compartments.
   Ronald Larsen, the chief electrician's mate, said there was a
``small fire in berthing, and a couple of people manned fire
extinguishers and attempted to put it out.''
   He said there were initial reports that the fire was under
control, then reports the fire was spreading.
   ``From everybody I talked to there was an explosion later, maybe
five minutes down the road,'' he said. ``I never heard the
explosion, being so far aft.''
   Crew members had donned gas masks and made an orderly evacuation
despite thick, poisonous smoke, he said. The sub's emergency lights
``hardly did any good because of the density of the smoke,'' Larsen
said.
   No one was available for comment on Larsen's account, an officer
at fleet headquarters said Thursday night. Telephone calls to four
spokesmen at home went unanswered or were not returend.
   The 219-foot Bonefish, one of the Navy's four remaining
diesel-electric subs, was cruising at periscope depth Sunday when
the first explosion hit its forward battery compartment, the Navy
said earlier. The batteries are used to power the sub when it is
below the surface.
   Recharging those batteries generates hydrogen gas, which can
explode if allowed to accumulate.
   After the explosions began, the Bonefish was able to surface 160
miles east of Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Cmdr. Mike Wilson, 42,
ordered the 92-member crew evacuated because of smoke and toxic
fumes, the Navy said.
   Two of the 89 survivors remained hospitalized Thursday.
   Larsen disputed speculation that high levels of hydrogen in the
battery compartments may have been responsible for the explosion.
``I know for a fact we had zero percent hydrogen in the battery
well,'' he said.
   Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Long, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet
Headquarters in Norfolk, Va., said earlier that preliminary
indications pointed toward a series of explosions aboard the sub,
including one in the battery compartment.
   The Navy said Thursday that bodies of two of the three sailors
had been removed from the submarine, which was being towed by the
salvage ship USS Hoist to Charleston, its home port.
   Larsen, from Bellows Falls, Vt., said he was in the engineering
section when the fire filled the craft with thick smoke. ``Before I
left, I held the flashlight up to my mask and you couldn't tell if
it was on or off,'' he said.
   The evacuation was orderly, however, he said. ``There were no
reports of anybody grabbing somebody by the waist so they could go
first,'' he said.
   Because crewmen were at their stations about 20 minutes before
they evacuated, they probably had time to become familiar with
their location, even in the dark, he said.
   The three victims were were relatively new to the crew, on board
four or five weeks, and may have been doomed by a lack of
familiarity with the craft's layout, Larsen said.
   The Bonefish, although ``running great'' at the time of the
accident, had a reputation for breaking down and not getting under
way on time because of its age, he said.
   Rep. Arthur Ravenel, R-S.C., a House Armed Services Committee
member whose district includes the naval base, said he had
dismissed what he called rumors that the Bonefish was not seaworthy.
   Ravenel said the Charleston Naval Shipyard had told him the
Bonefish was overhauled four years ago and its batteries were
replaced two years ago.
   A crewman told Charleston TV station WCIV on Wednesday that the
ship had been running fine before the accident.
   ``It was totally safe,'' said Seaman Chris Dolby. ``It was in
the best shape I'd see it in the two years I've been on the ship.''
   Another member of the crew, Petty Officer 2nd Class William
Baker, of Okolona, Ky., said Bonefish personnel were schooled in
handling emergencies.
   ``The crew acted in the best way possible. We train every day,
and this is where it paid off,'' Baker said.
   Chief Petty Officer Joseph C. Mowery, an Atlantic Fleet Command
spokesman in Norfolk the remains of Lt. Ray Everts, 30, of Naoma,
W.Va., and Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr., 39, of
Willis, Texas, were transferred to Naval Hospital in Charleston
late Wednesday.
   The body of Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren, 21, of
Pisgah Forest, N.C., will be removed with the assistance of a
medical team from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy before the
ship reaches Charleston, the Navy said.
   The Navy said a memorial service for the three crewmen will be
held Saturday in a Charleston Lutheran church.

<HEAD>Storm Brewing Over Cabinet Member's War Remarks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno leaves Saturday for
China and Southeast Asia, where he faces a storm of criticism over
a Cabinet member's remark that Japan was not the aggressor in World
War II.
   Seisuke Okuno, director of Japan's National Land Agency, angered
the Chinese and other Asians last week when he visited a Japanese
war memorial and said that Japan was simply defending itself in
World War II.
   He said his country ``fought to protect itself at a time when
the white race had turned Asia into a colony.''
   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Li Zhaoxing, said
Wednesday ``it's astonishing and very regrettable to us that a
minister of Japan made such discourteous remarks in this regard of
historical facts.''
   A spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that Uno
will not apologize for Okuno's remarks during his trip.
   ``This is not a matter of policy from the official stand of the
government, rather the personal comment of one Cabinet member,''
said spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda. ``I don't think Mr. Uno is going
to make any sort of formal apology.''
   However, he also acknowledged Japan had a responsibility in the
war.
   ``We are responsible for a lot of aggressiveness on our part,
not only in China but elsewhere,'' he said. ``No one in Japanese
society doubts this, except a very small amount of extremists,
which you have in any society.''
   Although he did not apologize, Okuno later said he was sorry
that his remarks were criticized by the Chinese media and he
acknowledged Japan caused major damage to its neighbors during
World War II, according to the Daily Yomiuri newspaper.
   Matsuda said there were no plans to dismiss Okuno.
   Education Minister Masayuki Fujio, a member of former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Cabinet, was fired after he said Korea
was partly responsible for its annexation by Japan in 1910, and
said Japan's actions against China during World War II were
justified.
   During his trip, Uno will visit Hong Kong, China, Indonesia and
Singapore.
   In Beijing, a meeting of Chinese and Japanese officials opened
Thursday with China criticizing Okuno's remarks.
   Huan Xiang, director of the Chinese State Council's
International Studies Center, said Okuno was trying to cover up
Japan's history.
   There were also strong reactions to Okuno's comments in
Singapore and Korea.
   The pro-government Straits Times newspaper in Singapore said in
an editorial: ``If there were a prize for political hogwash ... Mr.
Seiuke Okuno would win it hands down.''
   The official North Korean Central News Agency called the remarks
``an insult to human conscience.''
   In South Korea, the independent Seoul newspaper Hankook Ilbo
said in an editorial that the remark showed the Japanese have ``a
sense of superiority based on their economic success.''

   Rebels attacked a civilian convoy
traveling under military escort and killed 13 people, the national
news agency AIM reported Thursday.
   Guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance opened fire on
the eight-vehicle convoy Tuesday when it was about 30 miles north
of the capital, Maputo, AIM said, citing an unidentified military
source.
   Several survivors were sent to a hospital in Marracuene, about
12 miles away, where they were in serious condition, the news
agency added. AIM said all 13 killed were civilians.
   The rebels frequently attack convoys in raids on military and
civilian targets. The guerrillas have been fighting for 12 years to
overthrow Mozambique's Marxist government.
   Mozambique accuses South Africa of aiding the guerrillas.
Pretoria denies the charge.

   Leyton Ruiz suffered minor injuries in the landing and was
treated at a hospital in Ciudad Quesada, 110 miles north of San

police.
   There was no immediate word on whether his request for asylum
would be granted.
   Nicaragua has been ruled by the leftist Sandinistas since a 1979

   A woman was sentenced to life in prison
Thursday for killing a pregnant woman and cutting the baby out with
a car key.
   Darci Pierce, 20, was found guilty but mentally ill last month
of murder, kidnapping and child abuse in the slaying of Cindy Ray,
23, who was 8{ months' pregnant.
   The verdict meant the jury believed Mrs. Pierce was mentally ill
when she committed the crimes but did not meet the legal test for
insanity.
   Prosecutors contended that Mrs. Pierce was desperate for a child
and told her husband, an airman at Kirtland Air Force Base, that
she was pregnant and that she was going to have labor induced July
23.
   She waited outside a prenatal care clinic at the base that day
and abducted Mrs. Ray, the first nearly full-term pregnant woman to
walk out, prosecutors said.
   Mrs. Pierce drove to the mountains east of Albuquerque, where
she strangled Mrs. Ray and cut the baby from her body with a key.
The infant, named Amelia, survived.
   Mrs. Pierce was arrested after she went to an Albuquerque
hospital with a newborn girl and doctors determined she had not
given birth.
   Mrs. Ray's husband, Samuel, has returned to his home state of
Utah with the infant girl and her 2-year-old brother.
   Following testimony of two psychiatrists Thursday, state
District Judge Richard Traub ordered concurrent sentences of life
in prison for murder, 18 years for kidnapping and 18 months for
child abuse.
   Assistant District Attorney Harry Zimmerman recommended
consecutive sentences, calling the killing a ``gruesome, heinous
crime that was premeditated.''
   ``It's impossible to counterbalance the pain Darci Pierce placed
on the Ray family,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers failed in an initial
round of talks Thursday to reach agreement on a proposal to cut oil
exports in conjunction with non-OPEC producers, cartel leaders said.
   After a nearly four-hour session that ended early Friday, the 13
ministers said they would resume their closed-door deliberations
Friday evening.
   Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian president of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the ministers had discussed the
export-cutting plan ``in general terms, but nothing specific was
decided.''
   The proposed reductions, in combination with cuts by six
non-OPEC oil exporting countries, are designed to push up oil
prices and codify a new spirit of cooperation among oil producers.
   The six independent producers on Wednesday said they would cut
oil exports by 5 percent for two months if the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries did likewise.
   OPEC, however, is divided over how to respond to the offer,
which is the first such proposal from rival producers since the oil
cartel was formed in 1960.
   Oil prices on the open market fell Thursday. Brent crude from
the North Sea dropped as low as $16.90 a barrel before closing at
$17.20 in London, down 30 cents from Wednesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 29 cents to
close at $17.98 a barrel. The contract lost 33 cents on Wednesday.
   Iran strongly supports the non-OPEC proposal, both as a way of
strengthening the oil market and as a step toward closer ties with
non-OPEC producers.
   ``Any measures and means that can lead to this would be
supported by us,'' the Iranian oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh,
told reporters on his arrival from Tehran.
   Other OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, take a more cautious
view. They want to encourage outside producers to restrain their
oil output, but they see little merit in the terms of the proposal
under consideration in Vienna.
   Saudi King Fahd, meanwhile, reiterated his view that OPEC can
get prices up simply by sticking to its existing agreement on
production restraints. He did not comment directly on the non-OPEC
offer.
   ``I believe prices will go up if we adhere to the output ceiling
and convince non-OPEC producers of the feasibility of limiting
their production,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview
published Thursday by a Kuwaiti newspaper.
   Officials from the non-OPEC countries were not attending
Thursday's cartel meeting, so there was to be no direct negotiating
between the two groups.
   The offer from the non-OPEC producers _ Mexico, Egypt, China,
Oman, Malaysia and Angola _ states that they will cut their exports
by 5 percent from the average level over the past six months. They
said this amounted to about 200,000 barrels a day.
   The cuts would be for May and June only.
   A 5 percent cut by OPEC from its current level of exports would
amount to about 700,000 barrels a day. Together with the 200,000
barrels to be cut by the outsider producers, this could have a
significant impact on the market, analysts said.
   But it appeared increasingly clear that OPEC would not cut by as
much as proposed, sources in several delegations said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The cartel easily could argue that a much smaller reduction
would fulfill the terms of the outsiders' proposal, which says only
that a 5 percent cut by non-OPEC is conditioned on ``a similar
proportional response by OPEC.''
   If OPEC based its 5 percent cut on an average level of exports
over the past six months _ as the non-OPEC countries had done _
then OPEC would have to cut only about 200,000 barrels a day from
its actual present rate of exports. This is because OPEC's exports
were substantially higher in the latter part of 1987.
   A cut of 200,000 barrels a day by both groups would have little
or no impact on the balance between oil supply and demand, said
Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based oil consultant and a former OPEC
staffer.
   ``It would have only a symbolic impact,'' he said.

   The Senate on Thursday voted to provide $526.6
million to the Veterans Administration to keep its home mortgage
subsidy program from running out of money next week and sent the
bill to the White House.
   The House had approved the bill Wednesday. President Reagan is
expected to sign it.
   The VA's Loan Guaranty Revolving Fund, depleted by a higher than
expected number of foreclosures on its home mortgages, has been
operating since last month on money borrowed from other accounts
within the agency.
   The bill Congress passed this week would replenish those other
accounts and provide enough money to continue the program through
the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30.

   The Sandinista government proposed on
Thursday that the two-month cease-fire be extended by 30 days to
allow negotiators to work out an enduring peace with rebels, but
the rebels immediately said no.
   Azucena Ferrey, spokeswoman for the rebels, known as the
Contras, said the Sandinista proposal ``shows they lack good will.''
   She noted in a telephone interview that the current cease-fire
expires at the end of May, and said that ``if they want to extend
it (the cease-fire) they can propose it then.''
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and the leader of the
leftist government's delegation to the peace talks, told reporters
such an extension ``will help improve the conditions under which
the negotiations are taking place so that an overall agreement can
be discussed to reach a final accord.''
   The 60-day provisional truce, which started April 1, is part of
an agreement reached by the U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinistas
at the southern border post of Sapoa on March 23.
   During the truce the two sides are to attempt to negotiate an
end to the 6{-year-old conflict that has cost more than 26,000
lives, by government estimates.
   Ortega, the brother of President Daniel Ortega, announced the
offer shortly before the delegations resumed high-level political
talks.
   The government also offered Thursday to let the International
Red Cross administer humanitarian aid immediately to the Contras
even before rebel combatants gather inside safe zones established
during previous talks.
   The Sandinista proposal was read by Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco, who said the offer was ``an attempt to
facilitate the pacification process.''
   Sandinista and Contra negotiators previously agreed upon seven
safe zones in which the Contra fighters are to collect. The two
sides differed over operational conditions inside the zones,
however, and the rebels have yet to gather inside them.
   The three-day negotiating session marks only the second time the
two sides have met in Managua since the war began in 1981. Recent
reports have said that the Contra leadership is divided, with the
rebel military commanders opposing any immediate agreement with the
Sandinistas.
   President Ortega on Wednesday predicted an agreement can be
reached if both sides bargain in good faith.
   However, the Sandinistas and the Contras remain far apart on
essential issues.
   Humberto Ortega accused the rebel commanders of taking part in
the talks ``not with the purpose of reaching agreement'' but to buy
time.
   American and other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said rebel leader Adolfo Calero tried unsuccessfully to oust the
top rebel military commander, Enrique Bermudez, a week ago.
   A U.S. official said the Contra directors split 2-2 with one
abstention on whether to remove Bermudez. He ostensibly takes
orders from the five-member civilian directorate but believes he
should have more influence over rebel decisions, the sources said.
   Calero argues that civilian control over the movement is
essential and sees Bermudez as a threat to that objective.
   In an effort to dispel rumors of disunity, Bermudez and other
Contra leaders issued a statement in Miami on Wednesday declaring
support for the talks. Calero, in a telephone interview Thursday,
denied there was any split in rebel ranks.
   ``There are obviously sectors who would be interested in there
being such a split,'' he said.

   Just in time for the parched tourist season,
Parliament approved legislation Thursday to let pubs stay open all
afternoon.
   The changes in English licensing laws, the first in 71 years,
promise a minor revolution in national drinking habits.
   Since World War I, pubs have had to send patrons packing and
shut their doors at midafternoon _ about the time the weary,
thirsty tourist thinks of settling into a pint of English beer and
giving his feet a rest.
   When the changes go into effect by summer, pubs will be allowed
to stay open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day but Sunday. Under
current law, the hours are 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. or 6
p.m. to 11 p.m.
   One controversial amendment which slipped by the House of Lords
extends Sunday drinking by one hour. Pubs will still have to close
Sunday afternoons, but will now be open from noon to 3 p.m., insted
of 2 p.m.
   As now, they will then shut down until 7 p.m. and close for the
day at 10:30 p.m.
   The 1916 Licensing Law that shut pubs down after lunch was aimed
at curbing drinking by World War I munitions workers.
   The new hours, to become law after the formality of the queen's
approval, will be in effect in England and Wales. Scotland has
separate licensing laws. No date has been stated for implementing
the new hours.
   Organizations of consumers, tourists and brewers applaud the
changes, but some people say it will cause excessive drinking and
will be tiring for pub staff. The British Medical Association has
said it feared an upsurge in alcohol-related illness and road
accidents.
   The Sunday clause, opposed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government, was an amendment introduced last week into
the unelected House of Lords.
   It was brought to the floor, and when the presiding officer
asked if there were objections, Home Office Minister Lord Robert
Ferrers, in accordance with procedure for opposing measures in the
Lords, shouted ``Not content!''
   He expected to be joined by other Conservative lords, but they
missed their cues and because no one spoke up a second time the
amendment, by procedure, was deemed to have been approved.

   The Soviet Union accused U.S. officials on
Thursday of slowing work on a treaty to halve superpower arsenals
of strategic nuclear arms.
   ``Rather than cooling down the delegations at Geneva we must do
our utmost in the spriit of the Washington accord to intensify
efforts to work out the treaty,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim
P. Perfiliev said at a regular news briefing.
   U.S. and Soviet delegations are working in Geneva on a treaty
that would cut nuclear arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles, but
officials have said numerous differences remain. Both U.S. and
Soviet officials have expressed doubt the treaty will be completed
in time for President Reagan's May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   During Gorbachev's visit last December to Washington, the two
signed an accord eliminating medium- and shorter-range nuclear
weapons.
   Perfiliev said U.S. officials were dragging their feet on the
strategic arms accord by ``putting brakes on the tempo of work on
the Geneva documents and the postponement of difficult questions
until better times.''
   ``Such an approach cannot but give rise to serious concern,'' he
said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze tried in a Moscow meeting last week to
resolve differences over the treaty, but little progress was
reported. The two are due to meet again in Geneva May 11-12 to make
a last attempt at reaching agreement before the Moscow summit.

   The Senate on Thursday passed a billion-dollar
AIDS information and research bill that calls for mandatory AIDS
testing of people convicted of sex and drug crimes.
   ``Finally, we have declared war on the virus and not on the
victims in our battle against AIDS,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said after the 87-4 vote.
   The vote came after hours of bitter argument over the content of
educational materials paid for with federal dollars.
   Tempers were lost, curses hurled and senators denied the
opportunity to speak as lawmakers debated whether to renew a 1987
ban on federally funded materials that directly promote or
encourage homosexuality.
   The ban, which expires Sept. 30, was passed last year 94-2. But
sentiment shifted this year after several senators said it was
having a chilling effect on public health efforts in the homosexual
community, which has the highest percentage of AIDS victims.
   The Senate agreed to the ban sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., but also agreed to another provision that says education
materials should stress the public health benefits of abstinence, a
single monogamous relationship and avoidance of intravenous drug
use. The provision also says no other part of the bill should
restrict the dissemination of accurate information to anyone at
risk, apparently superseding the Helms ban.
   In addition to voting unanimously to approve mandatory AIDS
testing of people convicted of sex and drug crimes, the Senate also
accepted neutralized versions of several conservative amendments
that supporters said would have hampered the bill.
   Sens. Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, sponsors of the fiscal
1988 research and education bill, called it the nation's first
comprehensive statement of an AIDS policy. The two are chairman and
ranking minority member, respectively, of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee.
   The bill authorizes $665 million for state and federal AIDS
education programs, increased hiring at the National Institutes of
Health, a new home health care program for AIDS victims and special
efforts to help high-risk minorities and intravenous drug abusers.
A committee aide said open-ended research money would bring to
total to about $1.1 billion in annual spending.
   The bill's passage also was lauded by Victor Basile, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, the national political
action committee for the gay and lesbian community.
   ``We wanted to say how delighted we were with the final passage
... which for the first time establishes a national policy on
AIDS,'' Basile said. ``With respect to Jesse Helms and his attempts
to make war on people who are sick, we're happy that the Senate has
decided overwhelmingly to make war on a disease instead.''
   In the House, a bill covering research on AIDS is pending in the
House Energy and Commerce Committee's health subcommittee. Bills
covering the other areas included in the Senate bill have not be
introduced.
   The 97-0 vote on a testing amendment by Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., marked the first time Congress has ventured into uncharted
areas of AIDS testing and confidentiality.
   The Reagan administration announced last year it would test new
immigrants and the Senate later put its stamp of approval on the
policy. The Defense Department tests all 2.1 million men and women
on active military duty as well as all recruit applicants and the
Justice Department said last October that it would test some
federal prisoners.
   Under the Senate measure, anyone convicted of a state or federal
crime related to sex or intravenous drugs, carrying a penalty of
death or at least a year in prison, would be tested. Results would
be confidential but could be disclosed to prison wardens or victims
of sex crimes.
   Homosexuals and intravenous drug users have been the chief
victims of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which
attacks the body's immune system and is spread through blood, blood
products or semen. As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about
59,500 Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died
since June 1981, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   Helms said several senators on Wednesday had viewed a federally
funded videotape used in the homosexual community and became ``sick
to their stomachs. It had explicit instructions about how to engage
in homosexual activity. It had two men doing it.''
   Helms contended 95 percent of Americans would agree with the ban
on federally funded materials that promote or encourage
homosexuality. But his amendment was challenged by a fellow
conservative, Hatch, who said public health efforts ought not
exclude the group affected most by AIDS.
   ``We have to tell homosexuals more than simply to become
heterosexuals,'' Hatch told Helms. ``At least if they won't or
can't become heterosexuals, we can encourage them to abstain from
promiscuous sexual activities. It just makes sense. This will
decrease their risk and maybe even more importantly the risk to all
the rest of the people in our country and throughout the world.''
   Responded Helms: ``We're in the business of creating fig leaves
in this place.''
   Kennedy succeeded in weakening an earlier Helms amendment that
would have banned federal funds for clean-needle programs. Under
such programs, drug addicts receive the clean needles in exchange
for shared, dirty needles that may be contaminated with the AIDS
virus.
   The Senate twice rejected the Helms version of the plan but
approved by voice vote a compromise that bans such use of federal
money unless the surgeon general deems the programs effective in
stopping drug abuse or the spread of AIDS among addicts.
   Kennedy called the Helms clean-needle amendments ``poorly
crafted political mischief ... being thrown out as no more than a
harassing technique'' against a popular bill. He said it is much
too early to decide that needle-exchange programs don't work and
shouldn't be used.
   But Helms condemned the compromise, saying Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop has already said the programs may be a good idea.
``It's just a matter of time'' before federal money is spent on
them, Helms said.
   Kennedy also derailed another amendment that would have required
state certification that no AIDS patient would be denied routine
nutrition or hydration if that would lead to death.
   ``This amendment vigorously protects the rights of AIDS
victims,'' said Armstrong, sponsor of the measure. But the Senate,
after nearly three hours of discussion, instead approved, 60-36, a
Kennedy substitute asking the congressional biomedical ethics board
to study the problem as it relates to patients with any disease.
   Those senators voting against the AIDS bill were Helms; William
Armstrong, R-Colo.; James McClure, R-Idaho, and Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo. Not voting on the bill were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.;
David Boren, D-Okla.; Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.; Daniel Evans, R-Wash.;
David Karnes, R-Neb.; Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.;
John Stennis, D-Miss; Steve Symms, R-Idaho.

   A woman accused of killing her husband and
another woman with cyanide-laced Excedrin wrote a bank five days
before his death to say the couple's money problems would soon be
over, a prosecutor said Thursday.
   But under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne
Maida, Stella Nickell denied telling FBI investigators that she
expected to benefit from the 1986 death of Bruce Nickell, 52.
   ``I told them I didn't expect to benefit at all because money
was not important to me. My husband was. I would have sooner had
him than any amount of money,'' Mrs. Nickell said.
   The 44-year-old Auburn woman is accused of five instances of
tampering with over-the-counter medicine, including two cases
involving deaths, in the first such death-by-tampering ever to go
to trial in this country.
   Both the defense and the prosecution rested their cases later
Thursday, and closing arguments were scheduled for Monday.
   Prosecutors charge Mrs. Nickell plotted the death of her husband
to collect $176,000 in insurance benefits and put other tainted
pain-relievers on the shelves of area drugstores to make the
tampering appear random.
   Sue Katherine Snow, 40, of Auburn also died in June 1986 after
swallowing cyanide-laced Excedrin. If convicted, Mrs. Nickell could
face life in prison.
   Ms. Maida called a rebuttal witness who said Mrs. Nickell's
daughter, Cindy Hamilton, told her of Mrs. Nickell's plans in
November 1985, more than seven months before Nickell died.
   The witness, Katherine Parker of Tacoma, said Ms. Hamilton, her
former roommate, told her, ``Katy, do you know what my mother just
said to me? She asked me how much cocaine it would take to kill a
person.''
   Ms. Hamilton ``said that her mother had been talking about
getting rid of her father. ... She was getting tired of him,'' Ms.
Parker said.
   Ms. Hamilton had testified Tuesday that her mother had discussed
putting cocaine in Nickell's iced tea to make his death look like
an overdose.
   Mrs. Nickell, asked Wednesday if she had ever told her daughter
that she intended to poison her husband with cyanide, or that she
had attempted to kill her husband, replied, ``No.''
   Earlier Thursday, under questioning by Ms. Maida, Mrs. Nickell
confirmed that she and her husband owed three banks and an
investment company $8,553 in April and May of 1986, but she denied
that their financial situation was getting worse.
   On April 25, Mrs. Nickell wrote one bank that she was having
``marriage problems'' that would soon be solved. Five days before
Nickell's death, she wrote the same bank that ``my payments will
now stay current,'' Maida said.
   Mrs. Nickell's attorney, public defender Tom Hillier, ended his
examination of her by asking if she killed her husband.
   ``No I did not,'' she answered in an steady voice.
   ``The thought never entered my mind and never would because I
loved Bruce too much,'' she said. ``There's no way I'd ever think
of getting rid of him.''
   Hillier also asked her if she tried to copy the unsolved Tylenol
tampering case in which seven people died in the Chicago area in
1982. Mrs. Nickell denied that accusation, raised by her daughter
in earlier testimony, as well as claims she planned to leave her
husband.
   Ms. Maida had Mrs. Nickell read passages about cyanide from
``Deadly Harvest,'' a library book Mrs. Nickell borrowed in 1983
and 1984. The book dealt with poisons and poisonous plants.
   ``Cyanide is often employed as the lethal substance in murder
mysteries,'' Nickell read slowly as a packed courtroom and a U.S.
District Court jury listened.
   Mrs. Nickell denied taking notes from ``Deadly Harvest'' when
Ms. Maida said some of Mrs. Nickell's 87 fingerprints found in the
book were cut off by a straight line, as if by a piece of notebook
paper.
   During her testimony Wednesday, Mrs. Nickell tearfully told of
watching Nickell collapse, saying she never knew he was dying.
   ``Babe, I feel like I'm going to pass out,'' she quoted her
husband as saying before he collapsed at their home June 5, 1986.
   Mrs. Nickell described her husband as a loving, good-natured man
with a sense of humor. She denied telling family members her
marriage was unhappy or that their periodic financial stresseshad
threatened their marriage.
   Prosecutors allege she forged her husband's signature on
insurance paperwork. But she said signed the forms with his
permission because he ``despised paperwork.''

picked one of the most vulnerable spots along Israel's border with

   The infiltration on Wednesday was the second by guerrillas in as
many days. Also Wednesday, an army report concluded that a
15-year-old female Jewish settler whose death in the occupied lands
raised a furor was killed by a bullet from a careless Israeli
guard, not by stones thrown by Palestinians.
   But the report also blamed Arabs from the West Bank town of

   Gorbachev is counting on better relations with the West to give
him breathing space for badly needed economic reforms in the Soviet
Union.
   A new Polish crisis would pose a dilemma for him.
   If Gorbachev is perceived in the West as backing violent

   A drug that can be purchased over the counter

potent agent against the AIDS virus, a group of National Cancer
Institute researchers report.
   The drug, called dextran sulfate, was found to prevent the AIDS
virus from infecting and killing the body's T-cell lymphocytes, the
main target of the virus, a researcher said Thursday.
   ``We found in the test tube that this agent is a very a powerful
inhibitor of the HIV virus,'' said Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal, a NCI
researcher and co-author of a study on dextran sulfate. HIV, for
human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes acquired

   ATLANTA (AP) _ Despite extensive publicity about cholesterol and

go to get people to know their numbers.''

   Blood transfusions in the U.S. carry a small
but ``not insignificant'' chance of transmitting a virus that has
been closely linked to a particularly vicious type of adult
leukemia, according to an American Red Cross screening of the
nation's blood supply.
   As a result of the study, Red Cross experts are recommending
that all donated blood be screened for the leukemia virus as soon
as scientists can develop an effective and practical confirming
test.
   Alan E. Williams, a research scientist at the Red Cross
laboratory in Rockville, Md., said the virus, called human
T-lymphotropic virus type I, or HTLV-1, was found in 10 samples out
of more than 39,800 blood units tested in eight cities across
America.

   Emperor Hirohito, who celebrates his 87th birthday
on Friday, says he feels well after intestinal surgery and needs
years more to finish research in marine biology, his favorite hobby.
   The world's longest-reigning monarch said he had replanted an
endangered plant species on the palace grounds and ``it is growing
well because the imperial garden is similar to forest land.''
   During a news conference marking his birthday, a national
holiday, the emperor said World War II was his ``most unpleasant
memory'' and urged the Japanese to pursue peace.

   A deputy U.S. marshal's family reunion two
years ago led to a break in a 1980 murder case _ and an indictment
this week against his own brother and a nephew.
   Investigators had worked for years with little progress in
solving the slayings of four elderly people during an apparent
robbery.
   Then, in 1986, the deputy marshal, Olbert Hiett, attended a
family reunion and took a sawed-off shotgun, an illegal weapon,
from his brother, Charles Hiett, 51.

   The horseradish, touted through the
years for its ability to spice up everything from romance to steak,
grows nowhere quite so well as in the nation's ``horseradish
capital.''
   Now the proud farmers just across the Mississippi River from St.
Louis who still cultivate the ugly, pungent root that their
ancestors brought from Europe in the 19th century have decided it's
time to celebrate its success.
   So they're sponsoring the First International Horseradish
Festival Saturday in Collinsville, complete with contests to see
who can eat the most horseradishes or throw their roots the
farthest.

<HEAD>Elite West German School Shaken by Sex and Alcohol Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than 60 years, Salem School
has quietly educated Europe's elite, including Britain's Prince
Philip, Queen Sophia of Spain and Golo Mann, the historian and son
of Nobel Prize novelist Thomas Mann.
   But the count who lives in a castle next door here in tranquil
foothills near Lake Constance has accused Salem's officials of
permitting widespread sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse among its
teen-age students.
   The officials call the charges baseless and say the school is a
victim of a vicious assault by Count Max von Baden, whose family
owns the school property.
   ``These charges are only a pretext for what is in reality his
bitter fight to gain control of the school,'' Bernhard Bueb, the
school's director, said in an interview
   He added that relations between school authorities and the count
soured in 1980 when a pregnant, unmarried teacher was allowed to
stay on. A similar case in 1984 further fueled the count's
displeasure with the school, he said.
   In a so far unsuccessful legal bid to evict the school from the
property, the count has cited alleged examples of sexual encounters
between students on school grounds and alcohol and drug abuse as
proof that Salem is no longer fulfilling its mission.
   He claimed former students recounted allegations that boys had
used pass keys to enter girls' dormitories and that hashish had
been found on school grounds in 1985.
   The count also maintained that the school has become too
progressive and has strayed from the educational precepts of its
founder, Kurt Hahn, a Jew who presided over the school until he was
forced to flee Nazi persecution in 1933.
   Salem School was founded in 1920 by Hahn and Prince Max von
Baden, Count Max's grandfather.
   The prince allowed the school to use the grounds and buildings
of a medieval monastery and was its benefactor until his death in
1929.
   The von Baden family remained directly involved in the school
until 1959, when the count's father declared it independent of
family control.
   Since then, the family's involvement has been largely
ceremonial, with only a rental agreement binding it to the school.
The agreement expires in 1999.
   Golo Mann, who attended Salem in 1923-27, said recently he ``has
no regrets and looks back fondly'' on his four years there.
   ``It was a little Spartan, but it strengthened my character.''
   Prince Philip entered the school in 1933, in the last days of
its leadership under Hahn. After Hahn fled and founded a new school
in Gordonstoun, Scotland, in 1934, Philip remained his pupil there.
   The prince later sent his sons Charles, Andrew, and Edward to
the Gordonstoun school, which is run on the same stringent
principles as the Salem School.
   When Queen Sophia of Spain attended the Salem School as a
princess of Greece in 1951-55, it was run by an uncle on her
mother's side.
   ``She enjoyed attending the school, and has been back on several
occasions to visit,'' said a retired administrator of the school.
   Today, Salem School has 242 pupils 14 to 17 years old. Tuition
averages about $16,500 a year.
   Students stroll across manicured castle grounds to classes in
restored 13th-century buildings, all under the watchful and
critical eye of the count, who lives in an 18th-century Baroque
castle next door.
   Hahn's founding and guiding principle for the school was the
conviction that the body and character must be developed as well as
the mind.
   Smoking, alcohol and sexual contact were forbidden.
   Each day began with a morning jog. Every student was required to
wear a uniform, exercise and take two cold showers a day.
   The uniforms are gone now, and so are the cold showers.
   The morning jog remains, but the oldest students are allowed to
smoke off campus and congregate on weekends in local pubs approved
by school officials.
   ``Society and education have changed since our school was
founded,'' Bueb said.
   He denied the count's charges that a permissive atmosphere had
led students to run amok in sexual and alcoholic excess.
   ``Of course there have been instances when students have had too
much to drink or have been caught having relations at the school,''
Bueb said. ``But the count makes it look like this sort of thing
happens every day, when in fact his examples stem from incidents
that occurred over 12 years.''
   Bueb said pupils found to be drunk must perform 20 hours of work
and that those caught with illegal drugs are immediately expelled.
   A 1986 decision by an abitration court found insufficient
evidence to warrant granting the count's request to immediately
terminate the school's lease. A court in Constance recently upheld
the ruling.
   But the count has said he would seek a new arbitration hearing,
this time to impose hefty rent increases, and renewed demands that
the school vacate the property.
   He said he wants to use the property for his own school that
``will again conform to Hahn's priniciples.''

<TEXT>
   Some foreign embassies are cashing in on the high
value of real estate in central Tokyo.
   Australia is selling its Tokyo property to help balance the
budget back home.
   Mainland China is doing it to finance a new ambassador's
residence in Tokyo.
   The Argentine Embassy has refused to comment on Japanese press
reports that it is looking to sell its ambassador's residence to
help pay for the building of Argentina's new capital city.
   But the diplomatic missions of poorer countries complain of
being priced out of Tokyo.
   The African nation of Uganda, for example, closed its embassy in
Tokyo last year and its mission in China now doubles as the embassy
for Japan.
   Embassy land sales have generated waves in diplomatic channels
because local authorities are trying to lower prices in hopes of
stemming further increases in property prices in the world's most
expensive city.
   ``The Australian government decided it would reduce its current
account deficit by selling some of its assets,'' including
one-third of its land in Tokyo, said an embassy spokesman. ``The
high value of the yen and booming real estate were factors in the
government decision to sell.''
   Australia's 1.5 acres of prime land with a pond and many trees
is in the posh Minato ward and, according to the spokesman, was
recently sold to a consortium of four Japanese and two Australian
firms.
   The bid price was $475 million or, according to news reports,
2.5 times the asking price for adjacent land.
   ``It wasn't exactly double the standard price, but it was
slightly too high,'' said a metropolitan government official,
speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   ``We told them to lower the price, otherwise it would jack up
the price of the surrounding area,'' he added.
   According to Japanese land law, foreign missions are free to
sell their property at any cost, the metropolitan government
official said. But in light of the recent acceleration in prices,
sellers are required to report terms of sales to the government
before signing contracts.
   ``We then advise them if the price is too high,'' the official
said, but the city has no power to stop a sale.
   According to the government-run National Land Agency, the cost
of residential real estate skyrocketed a record 68.9 percent in
fiscal 1987, almost double the previous high of 35.9 percent in
1973 and nearly three times the 1986 increase of 23.8 percent.
   The agency attributed the phenomenal rise to speculative buying
prompted by money surpluses and lowered interest rates.
   While big powers like the United States and the Soviet Union
seem settled on their prime embassy grounds, the Chinese Embassy is
looking to unload part of its property for a reported $111 million.
   ``We want to sell the land to purchase another property for
building our ambassador's residence,'' said an embassy official.
   The Embassy of Zambia, which rents the property it occupies, is
threatened by a redevelopment plan that would raze the mission
buildings to make way for a highrise business complex.
   ``If our landlord is bought out, we will be too,'' said
Ambassador Boniface Zulu. ``We will not stand in the way of
progress, though we like it here and want to stay.''
   But Shozo Yamaguchi, the landlord, is anxious to sell.
   ``Instead of all these little houses, it would be better to have
a highrise,'' he said.
   ``For us (landlords), renting to diplomats is like volunteer
work. If there is some problem with rent payment, the Foreign
Ministry won't touch it, but they also urge us not to evict
diplomats for fear of repercussions.
   ``All we can do is cry ourselves to sleep.''
   The Zambian predicament reflects a growing problem among foreign
missions in Tokyo.
   Some operate with skeleton staffs because of the high cost of
living in Tokyo.
   Late last year, a group of six ambassadors met with Foreign
Minister Sosuke Uno and asked the government to ``provide
inexpensive land for construction of embassy-related buildings in
Tokyo,'' a Foreign Ministry official said.
   The ministry set up a study group to discuss the proposal, the
official said, but it ``has not come up with any concrete ideas.''

   It was January 1983 and the new Michael Stanley
Dukakis was at House Speaker Tom McGee's door.
   Dukakis, back for a second term as governor four years after he
was bounced from office, was chastened, wary and ready to play ball.
   ``From the first day he came back he was an entirely different
person,'' said McGee, who had fumed about having to wait outside
Dukakis' office during his first term as governor. ``During the
four years he was out, he certainly learned how to deal with
people. He leaned on us for advice, which was unheard of in the
first term.''
   Dukakis leaned on nobody for advice in his first term. He
appeared arrogant and aloof as he defiantly refused pleas from
McGee and other legislative leaders to raise taxes as the state
teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.
   Barney Frank, now a liberal Democratic congressman from
Massachusetts but at the time a state legislator, is quoted in a
recent biography of Dukakis as saying, ``Everyone in America except
him knew he had to raise taxes.''
   Instead, Dukakis cut state spending, refused to give state
workers a cost-of-living increase at a time of double-digit
inflation and slashed thousands from the welfare rolls. Liberal
activists who had helped elect Dukakis labeled him a turncoat.
   Eleven months after taking office he finally gave in and signed
the largest tax hike in Massachusetts history, an income tax
surcharge coupled with an increase in the sales tax. Although he
would enjoy some legislative successes in the next three years, he
never recovered from the furor caused by the tax hike and program
cuts.
   ``He had alienated probably every group that had been with
him,'' said McGee. ``And on top of that he didn't really campaign
hard enough.''
   So in the Democratic primary in 1978, Democrats rejected Dukakis
for renomination, choosing instead a conservative, Edward J. King.
   Dukakis spent his years out of office lecturing at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   Returned to office in 1982 and re-elected in 1986, he has
changed his ways. He listens to others now and he champions causes
that, while complex, are for the most part popular.
   ``This is not a fellow who has taken a lot of risks in his
career,'' said Martin Linsky, a former Republican legislator who
now teaches at the Kennedy School. ``He represents integrity and
competence. He's not a person who tackles highly provocative issues
in a challenging way.''
   He even has run the risk of being labeled a flip-flopper by
changing course on a couple of key issues.
   Dukakis the compromiser was most in evidence recently when he
announced he would not fight efforts to keep first-degree murderers
from getting furloughs from prison. He supports furloughs, but the
concept fell into disfavor with legislators after a convicted
murderer on furlough fled to Maryland and raped a woman.
   Dukakis said he changed his mind as any good manager would when
confronted with such strong sentiment.
   The new Michael Dukakis started his second term on a roll. The
state Republican Party was in disarray and Massachusetts was in the
midst of a stunning economic turnaround anchored by the booming
high-tech industry that had settled in the area to draw from the
brain banks of nearby universities. Unemployment, which had
approached 13 percent in 1975, had plummeted below 4 percent.
People started referring to the ``Massachusetts Miracle.''
   As a presidential candidate, Dukakis has been criticized on the
grounds he was taking undeserved credit for the state economy.
Studies have attributed most of the boom to high tech, but also
have credited Dukakis for not impeding progress and for innovative
programs to steer businesses away from the Boston area and into
depressed shoe and textile mill cities.
   Dukakis makes frequent references these days to perhaps his
three greatest achievements as governor: legislation guaranteeing
health care to all workers; a jobs training program for welfare
recipients that state officials say has resulted in 45,000 job
placements and reduced the state welfare caseload; and a vigorous
tax enforcement program credited with turning the $300 million
deficit that Dukakis inherited from King into a $500 million
surplus.
   The welfare program, Employment Training, and the tax
enforcement package were enacted during Dukakis' second term. He
also won passage of a condominium conversion bill protecting
tenants, a law requiring employers to notify workers about the use
of toxic materials and a plant-closing law he now trumpets on the
campaign trail. It encourages tottering businesses to notify the
state before shutting down and provides job-training programs for
workers in danger of losing their jobs.
   Instructive of Dukakis' new style was the way he handled the tax
collection package known as REAP _ Revenue Enhancement and
Protection.
   Publishing the names of tax scofflaws in newspapers and shutting
down businesses that owed taxes were not overwhelmingly popular
ideas. In his first term, Dukakis likely would have dropped the
package on the Legislature with a take-it-or-leave-it attitude.
Instead, he called together an array of lawmakers and interest
groups.
   ``He told them they would have to fight for smaller slices or
give him the resources he needed,'' recalls Ira Jackson, a former
state tax commissioner. ``He listened, they listened and we got it
all.''
   The legislature during his second term did reject some Dukakis
ideas _ a new business tax to fund infrastructure programs, a gay
rights bill and a proposal to finance the state pension fund
liability which has kept Massachusetts from getting a top bond
rating.
   As Massachusetts prospered, and Dukakis and his state began to
get national attention, there were growing signs the governor had
an eye on the national political landscape.

   In 1984, he was considered a possible running mate for Walter
Mondale and was given several roles within the national Democratic
Party and the National Governors Association, traveling to
Washington and elsewhere promoting his jobs-for-welfare recipients
program and his tax collection ideas. His peers designated him the
nation's most effective governor.
   His willingness to make deals and a good sense of timing were
serving him well.
   Dukakis, who had vetoed a 1984 tax cut, signed several tax
reductions in the next three years, even a repeal of the tax
surcharge that remained in place from his first term.
   He won a third term in 1986 with nearly 70 percent of the vote.
Now he boasts that he has experience ``mopping up Republican red
ink'' while cutting taxes.
   The assertion draws mixed reviews back home.
   ``I saw his ads in Pennsylvania when I was home visiting,'' said
Barbara Anderson, executive director of an anti-tax lobby called
Citizens for Limited Taxation. ``Those people out there don't know
that he was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts. The
reputation is a fabricated myth.''
   Linsky and Boston Democratic political consultant Michael
Goldman disagree.
   ``He did sign those tax cuts and he can say that,'' said Linsky.
``He doesn't say he proposed them.''
   ``Anything is fair play in the political arena,'' said Goldman.
``Politicians get more blame than they deserve for some things and
they also tend to get more credit than they deserve for others.''
   Still, some projections say spending will have to be rolled back
or the state could face a $200 million deficit by the end of the
current fiscal year.
   ``I think many people who are familiar with financial management
are laughing when people say our state is in great fiscal shape,''
said Alexander Tennant, executive director of the state Republican
Party.
   The GOP and Anderson blame Dukakis for the new budget crunch,
saying he should have put money aside instead of increasing state
spending by nearly $1 billion a year since returning to office. Yet
they also mounted much of the pressure that led to the tax cuts.
   ``Anyone can manage on a billion-dollar-a-year increase,'' said
Anderson. ``Wait until the miracle worker is facing the national
deficit. He'll do what he's done before, cut services and raise
taxes.''
   But that first term was a long time ago. Massachusetts is a
different state and Dukakis a different politician.
   Despite facing token Republican opposition in 1986, he
campaigned hard, mindful of 1978 and perhaps with an eye on
national exposure, beginning with his neighbors to the north, hosts
of the all-important New Hampshire presidential primary.
   He had said little during his first term while construction was
under way at New Hampshire's Seabrook nuclear power plant just over
the Massachusetts border. But he became a loud critic in recent
years.
   Dukakis now refuses to submit federally required evacuation
plans for Massachusetts towns near Seabrook, blocking the plant
from opening. Polls show a majority of New Hampshire residents
oppose Seabrook.
   Dukakis later began to criticize the troubled Pilgrim nuclear
power plant in his own state. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
considers it one of the nation's worst.
   The plant has been closed on the NRC's orders for two years and
Dukakis has demanded that state officials be permitted to question
managers about safety issues before the plant can be reopened.
   Shortly after being elected to his current term, Dukakis
introduced the health care measure, a first-in-the nation proposal
that guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by 1992.
He was so eager to get the idea enacted into law that his original
bill was derided by both parties as poorly conceived and had to be
completely reworked.
   Dukakis touts the plan as a national model, but critics say it
will not work in states without a strong economy.
   The governor generally is considered a good manager, but several
incidents involving subordinates have stirred doubts.
   He was shaken early in his presidential campaign when it came
out that his top aide, John Sasso, had leaked to reporters a
videotape showing that one of Dukakis' rival in the presidential
campaign, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, had used the words and
sentiments of a British politician as though they were his own. The
disclosure forced Biden out of the presidential race.
   Dukakis, who had said he disliked negative campaigning, said his
campaign had not been responsible for the leak.
   Later Sasso owned up to his role _ showing that Dukakis had been
kept in the dark by his closest adviser on an explosive issue. At
first, Dukakis said he would not fire Sasso; then he reluctantly
accepted his resignation.
   In another incident, a longtime Dukakis campaign organizer
appointed president at Bridgewater State College pleaded guilty
this month to diverting $80,000 in federal money for personal use
while he was in charge of the state's adult education program.
   And in 1986 it was disclosed that high state officials
authorized a $10,000 payment to a student who had accused the
president of Westfield State College of sexually assaulting him.
   Linsky believes voters consider Dukakis personally above
reproach in these incidents because of his role as a reformist
legislator in the 1960s and the ``Mr. Clean'' public image he has
created by his family man approach to his work.
   ``In that sense he's like (President) Reagan, not in the
`Teflon' sense but in the sense that he himself has a great deal of
integrity and that he is very comfortable with himself, not a
person who goes around conveying a lot of self-doubt,'' said Linksy.

<HEAD>The Return of Big Steel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of problems with old facilities and
foreign competition, and threatened and actual bankruptcies, the
steel industry is reclaiming its status in the American industrial
scene.
   Its return couldn't have been more effectively stated than on
April 26, when USX, the No. 1 steelmaker, Bethlehem,
Wheeling-Pittsburgh and National reported solid earnings
improvements.
   Just a year ago it was another story: USX was in the red,
Bethelehem was the subject of bankruptcy rumors, Wheeling had filed
for protection under the bankruptcy laws, and National was losing
money.
   Still, 1987 wasn't so bad. For the industry as a whole it was
the first profitable year since 1981. Yes, six straight years in
the red for what used to be considered the symbol of American
industrial might.
   Now, 1988 is shaping up as an even better year than 1987.
Reflecting this, steel stocks are in favor again and rising.
   Moreover, steel analysts are saying that the new steel industry
probably will be profitable for a long time to come, a consequence
not just of the lower dollar but of a long and costly rejuvenation
over the past decade or so.
   Says Harvey Katz, analyst for Value Line: ``The investment case
for steel is the strongest it's been in years, both for the
performance-minded and for those with a three- to five-year
perspective.''
   Among other things, the industry has rid itself of dated
facilities; shrunk itself by one-third; installed continuous
casting systems that reduce labor, materials and energy costs; and
retreated from ill-conceived diversifications.
   Its seemingly ages-old complaint about high labor costs _
workers in the steel industry commonly received much higher wages
than in comparable industries _ seems to have been resolved. Unions
have made wage concessions.
   The turnabout was a painful one, marked by years of outraged
charges of unfair foreign competition, demands for government
protection, confrontations with environmentalists, troubles with
labor and, some say, poor management.
   Old-time steel management was composed of dedicated individuals
who didn't like outsiders, including the U.S. government, telling
them what they must do. While committed to their industry, they
might also have been committed to old-fashioned techniques.
Whatever, they were no match for the newcomers.
   Foreign steel made in new plants by new techniques _ some
developed in the United States but not widely employed here _
flooded the country. Lower foreign wages helped; so did the
dollar's relatively high value in foreign trade.
   At times, it looked hopeless. A theory developed that the steel
industry for years to come would wander the world, with newly
industrialized nations snatching business from older producers with
old equipment and rising wages.
   It was a terrible thought for Americans to contemplate a steel
industry they had considered invulnerable. When the same problems
began arising in automotive and other industries, the brooding
intensified.
   It was a long road back for U.S. manufacturers, who seemed
reluctant to believe they shouldn't remain No. 1 even if their
products weren't. It was hard to swallow pride, but necessary to do
so before the recovery could begin.
   Now that steel producers seem competitive again, the marketplace
might give them a further thrust, says Katz. Underlying his
optimism, he says, is not just the lower dollar but the need for
refurbishing the U.S. infrastructure.
   Reminders of this need come every day in reports of bridges
requiring repairs or replacement. Few bridges are built anywhere
these days without a lot of steel in them.

<HEAD>$12,000 for Prep School? Is It Worth It???
^An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Convincing parents that top prep schools are
``worth'' tuitions exceeding $10,000 isn't always easy. But even
harder are the challenges of ensuring classrooms are filled in
future years with ethnically diverse students and faculty.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Perhaps the least of the
challenges facing the private school that proclaims itself ``the
pearl of the Midwest'' is explaining to parents why it's worth
$12,000 annual tuition.
   The 300-acre campus of Cranbrook Kingswood School outside
Detroit has the requisite prep-school luxuries: a hockey arena,
bowling alleys, indoor and outdoor tennis courts where players'
strokes are videotaped, and an old-time swimming hole called Lake
Jonah, so named because it's shaped like a whale.
   For its 800 students, each day is an aesthetic feast _ from the
tapestries and art deco light fixtures down to the very doorknobs
and lunchroom chairs. These, and practically everything else, were
designed or influenced by famed Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen,
who lived and taught here from 1925 to his death in 1950.
   But just as the virtues of top private schools like this aren't
just skin-deep, neither are the problems.
   With the school-age population declining and prep school
tuitions sometimes rivaling Ivy League colleges, officials worry
about future enrollments and are casting their recruiting nets from
coast to coast.
   The nation's approximately 1,700 independent private schools,
those not receiving tax or church funds, enroll some 600,000
students, up 9.7 percent over the last decade.
   But the number of students taking private school admissions
tests dropped by 14 percent in the last two years, according to the
National Association of Independent Schools.
   A few years ago, Cranbrook Kingswood could almost fill its
classes with students just from Michigan and surrounding Midwestern
states. Now the school recruits from as far away as southern
Florida and California.
   ``If we didn't do that kind of thing we wouldn't be in good
shape in five years because of the demographics. The best schools
are out there all the time,'' said admissions director Bruce
Kridler, whose travel budget has risen from $500 to $15,000 in
recent years, and who now makes routine visits to 35 cities in 17
states.
   Like other prep schools, Cranbrook Kingswood has constantly
fought a perception of elitism. The formerly all-white,
predominantly Episcopalian school is now 25 percent Jewish and 25
percent ``persons of color'' including Indians, Asian-Americans and
blacks, a change due largely to aggressive minority student
recruiting and a $15.8 million endowment that helps make sizable
scholarships possible.
   Cranbrook Kingswood is the most expensive boarding school in
Michigan, and among the most expensive in the Midwest. But it is a
bargain compared with the priciest Eastern schools.
   Leland Academy, in Franklin, Mass., is the nation's most
expensive private college preparatory school, charging $18,500 for
a year's tuition, fees, room and board. Cranbrook Kingswood, at
$12,000, ranks 44th in the nation.
   Another stubborn problem is finding minority teachers. Of 90
upper-school faculty members, four are black, one is Hispanic, one
is Asian-American.
   But such challenges seem remote at 8 a.m. as English teacher
Peter Fayroian poured the coffee in his carpeted classroom for a
dozen students, about half the size of most public school classes.
   He kicked off a discussion on the religious and moral
implications of Herman Hesse's classic ``Siddhartha'': ``Should we
prepare to come to the presence of the holy on a motorcycle?'' he
asked. ``What should be the relationship between technology and the
holy?''
   In Russ Conner's biology lab, nine juniors toil on a typically
complex question: At what wavelengths does chlorophyll in plants
absorb the most light?
   ``They use a college text,'' Conner said. ``And I don't give
them a whole lot of answers.''
   ``Academically I've never seen anything like it,'' said Jerry
Rubino from nearby Sterling Heights, Mich., whose daughter Lisa is
an 11th-grade day student. ``Public school kids might come home at
2:30 or 3 in the afternoon, but my daughter typically isn't home
until 6 or 7 at night, and then she buries herself in the books.''
   It's a school rule that the 270 boarding students must be in
their rooms studying every evening Sunday through Thursday.
   Upon graduation, each student's name is hand-carved into the oak
walls of Alumni Court. Those names include such luminaries as
Wyoming Senator Alan K. Simpson; Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the
Pentagon Papers; poet Brad Leithauser, and New Republic editor
Michael Kinsley.
   Nonetheless, schools that tout themselves as training grounds
for future leaders in an increasingly diverse world simply can't
ignore the issues of race and ethnicity any longer, said school
president and acting director Lillian Bauder.
   Yet private schools remain overwhelmingly white, according to
the NAIS's own statistics. In 1986-87, independent school
enrollments were 4.7 percent black, 1.8 percent Hispanic, 4.7
percent Asian-American and 0.1 percent Native American.
   ``I recruit in Cabrini Green,'' said Kridler, referring to an
all-black Chicago housing project, ``and I go to Mexican-American
neighborhoods.
   ``Inner city kids think we're not affordable. I talk a lot about
financial aid opportunities,'' Kridler said.
   About 24 percent of students in the upper school, grades 9-12,
get financial aid, covering two-thirds of need on average. Still,
22 students accepted last year did not enroll for money reasons.
   Low teacher salaries remain a source of frustration, especially
for younger faculty, even though median salaries have risen $7,000
in five years. Nationally, beginning private school teachers make
$12,000-19,000 and average salaries for all such teachers was
$23,000, about $5,000 less than public school teachers.
   Fayroian, a 25-year-old first-year teacher, earns $16,300. He
says he is up at 4 a.m. and in bed at midnight, spending his day
and evening grading papers, teaching classes and meeting with
students. The salary ``can be disheartening for the amount of work
we do,'' he said.
   Top scale at Cranbrook Kingswood is $34,000, and the median is
$25,600. There's no teacher union and no tenure.
   On the other hand, private school teachers generally have more
freedom to choose textbooks and shape their lessons free of
bureaucratic interference.
   At Cranbrook Kingswood, the resulting curriculum is so rigorous
many students find college easy by comparison. The school recently
studied its recent graduates and found their freshman grades often
improved compared with their grades at Cranbrook Kingswood.
Students who averaged 2.0 to 2.5 at the prep school averaged 2.86
as college freshmen, for example.
   What makes the grind worth it is the extraordinarily high
probability of admission to one of the better U.S. colleges.
   Of 190 graduates in 1987, 187 went to college, 14 as national
merit finalists. Their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores averaged
1100 of a possible 1600, compared with a national average of 906.
   Mark Botvinick, a 17-year-old senior from Bloomfield Hills,
whose public schools lead the state, nonetheless chose to come here
and was recently granted early acceptance at his dream school, Duke
University.
   Denise Brainard, a 12th grader from Crosslands, W.Va., says
there's no comparison between what she gets here and what she would
have gotten at her hometown school.
   ``Private schools are very stereotyped,'' she said. ``People
think they're very snobby. But we're not; we come here for the
education. I don't know what my chances would have been at Nitro
High School in Crosslands, W.Va.''

<HEAD>Ron Richardson Learns Japanese to Play the Slave Jim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tony award-winner Ron Richardson has done something
very few American actors would even think of trying: He's relearned
his lines in Japanese to bring a Broadway hit to Tokyo.
   His performance as Jim, the slave friend of Huckleberry Finn,
delights Japanese audiences and has made him and the musical ``Big
River'' a big success.
   ``When I walk out onto the stage and deliver my first line I
hear a loud, swift intake of breath,'' Richardson said. ``The
audience is surprised to see a black man walk out onto the stage
and speak in Japanese.''
   Richardson, who originated the role in the play which won the
Tony for best musical in 1985, said audiences are also surprised by
his booming voice, and, though generally more quiet and reserved
than Americans, react with a lot of noise themselves when the show
is over.
   ``They like me!'' Richardson laughed. ``We've been getting an
incredible reaction. I think the Japanese forget that they are in
Japan.''
   Before coming to Tokyo, Richardson, a 36-year-old native of
Philadelphia, said he really didn't know what to expect.
   ``I came here with an open mind, wide open for experiences,'' he
said in an interview. ``I was prepared to make adjustments.''
   Richardson began studying Japanese last August, six hours a week
at the Japan Society in New York. In November, he came to Japan on
a promotion tour and got a chance to try out his new-found skills.
Before coming back in February, he secluded himself on the Long
Island shore for 2{ months.
   ``It took me a very, very long time to learn my lines,'' he
said. ``I'm amazed I was able to do this. Up until the very end I
really wasn't sure.''
   The only part of the show he didn't need to relearn was the
songs. ``I had to sing in English or else I wouldn't be able to
make it. The songs in English give me time to regroup,'' he said.
   Three other Americans are in the 29-member cast, but Richardson
is the only one required to make long speeches in Japanese.
   Success hasn't left much time to get out and see the country,
but has given him a feel for Tokyo's workaholic pace. ``With eight
or nine shows a week, I only see Japan from my window.''
   Being way off Broadway is a pleasure, though. ``American
musicals are a new form for the Japanese cast, and they're
dedicated,'' he said. ``Theater people in the United States can be
complacent. But every night here is exciting.''
   After his first performance, Richardson was visited backstage by
Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko, who he said were warm
and generous with praise.
   Richardson's parents were also in Tokyo for opening night.
   ``I come from a talented family, and not much shakes them. But
this did,'' he said. ``They saw me in a whole new light. That was
nice.''

<TEXT>
   From broken hearts to broken bones, more than 2 million children
were abused and neglected across the United States last year. Three
died every day.
   Even more alarming, reports of child abuse have increased by 223
percent over 10 years, according to the National Committee for the
Prevention of Child Abuse, a non-profit, Chicago-based organization
with 67 chapters.
   The case numbers rose from 669,000 in 1976 to 2,160,000 in 1986,
although some experts say some part of the increase is due to
heightened public awareness and state laws that make reporting
mandatory.
   Tragically, too many abuse cases slip past the social agencies
meant to protect such children.
   Two recent cases in Massachusetts underscore the agencies'
limitations: In one, a toddler who had already survived two
fractured skulls was returned to her parents because an agency had
not told the hearing judge that assault charges were pending
against them; in the other, despite the best efforts of social
workers, an alcoholic mother allowed her twin daughters to starve
to death.
   Child abuse ranges from a lack of affection to death.
   Based on incomplete surveys and projections, the National
Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse estimated that 1,132
children died of abuse last year. But Cindy Moelis, a research
analyst for the committee, said the number could be as high as
5,000.
   ``Many deaths are often attributed to other causes such as
sudden infant death syndrome but are suspected to have been caused
by child abuse,'' said Ms. Moelis.
   According to recent committee findings, at least 25 percent of
the fatal cases had previously been referred to authorities but
fell through the cracks because there wasn't enough coordination
among between agencies.
   Ms. Moelis said authorities are so overwhelmed by their workload
that ``it's very difficult to assess which families are most at
risk of seriously harming their child.''
   In about half the cases, abuse takes the form of physical
neglect, according to a 1984 report from the American Association
for Protecting Children, based in Denver. Children are not properly
fed, clothed or given medical care. An additional 25 percent are
physically abused, 14 percent are sexually assaulted and 10 percent
suffer emotional abuse such as unreasonable parental demands or
lack of caring. In 85 percent of the cases, the abusers are the
parents.
   Many states are trying to deal more effectively with child abuse.
   Thirty-two states have review committees to examine child abuse
deaths. Fifteen states are trying to find better ways to flag the
greatest risk cases. Six states have passed or proposed legislation
to toughen sentences for abusers who kill children.
   According to Parents Anonymous, a self-help group aimed at
heading off abuse before it occurs, most abusive parents are under
stress, unable to meet their own needs or bothered by something
from their own childhoods.
   Judi Czimbal, director of program development for Massachusetts
Parents Anonymous, said the main problems are isolation, feelings
of being overwhelmed, financial problems and fatigue.
   ``They want to be good parents, but they often don't know how,''
said Mrs. Czimbal. ``They wind up getting very angry, and they'll
take their frustrations out on a child without wanting to.''

   The 18-month-old twins had been dead
at least 14 hours when they were found in their sheetless crib Dec.
20, 1983. One weighed 14 pounds, the other 11, less than half the
normal weight of babies their age.
   They had starved to death in the middle of the largest city in
western Massachusetts. In the middle of a housing project. Before
the eyes of their mother.
   Valarie Miller, 33, was sentenced Oct. 8, 1987, to six to nine
years in state prison after pleading guilty to two counts of
manslaughter by negligence, but the judge cut the sentence to one
year in prison and five years' probation.
   Detective Capt. Ernest Stelzer said the case was the most
extreme case of negligence he had seen in 24 years on the force.
Medical Examiner Loren Mednick testified at the inquest that the
children had no fat around their organs and were so dehydrated they
lacked even eye fluid.
   The case took Hampden County District Attorney Matthew J. Ryan
more than three years to resolve because of constant procedural
delays, and the inquest results, from 1984, were made public only
recently.
   Miller refused to be interviewed, but now that she is in prison,
neighbors are talking and court records and interviews help paint
the painful picture of how it happened.
   Latashia and Latoya Miller were born June 6, 1982, a month
early. Although underdeveloped, they appeared healthy to state
social workers and checked out fine with doctors up through their
last visit in August 1983.
   Their mother, however, seemed depressed. ``I had the feeling
that she was perhaps overwhelmed by the care of two children,''
Barbara Buell, a nurse with the Early Childhood Service Team who
visited the family until the twins were 6 months old, testified at
the inquest.
   A small, solitary woman, Miller lived with the twins in a
two-bedroom apartment in a project tucked into a residential
neighborhood of Springfield. Buell said the apartment was always
neat when she visited, but was devoid of toys or other signs of
children.
   ``You'd never think the children were living with her,'' she
said in a recent interview.
   She also said the mother resisted help.
   ``I know everybody made efforts to keep her in counseling and
they weren't too successful,'' Buell said. ``Oh, sure, she'd show
up, but she'd just sit there and look away from you.''
   Neighbors said Miller socialized in the summertime, often
bringing the babies to barbeques held nightly in the yards of the
dozen red, white and blue four-family apartment houses.
   She drank, the neighbors said.
   She also visited other apartments for what appeared to be an
afternoon drinking ritual, they said.
   The twins were left behind on those occasions.
   ``Some of the time she came back she was high or just
staggering,'' a downstairs neighbor, Earl Harris, testified at the
inquest.
   The twins' father, Harrison Wright, visitedeach Thursday. A
married man who'd met Miller at a bar where they worked, Wright
lived with his family on the other side of town but testified that
he sneaked away regularly to see his out-of-wedlock daughters,
bringing them diapers and cookies ``when I have an extra couple of
dollars.''
   Wright testified that they were fed ``adult food, like mashed
potatoes,'' and that when he mentioned their thinness to their
mother, she told him they had a cold and weren't eating properly.
   A week before the twins died, Gloria Green, who lived across the
street, sais she saw them lying in their crib, ``a bottle in each
hand and nothing in the bottle.''
   Despite the clues, however, ``it didn't dawn on me she wasn't
taking care of them,'' she said in an interview. She added that she
was afraid to report Miller, a fear experts say is common to
friends and relatives of alcoholics.
   ``If you see somebody coughing to death, you say, `How about
getting to a doctor?' But alcoholism is another thing,'' said
Collette Ross, a counselor at Alcoholism Services of Greater
Springfield. ``People feel they are infringing on the alcoholic's
right to privacy.''
   Miller's boyfriend, Bobbie L. Stovall, testified that he and
Miller spent the evening of Dec. 19 and the early hours of Dec. 20,
1983, at her apartment, drinking vodka and beer. She later told
police the children ``fussed all night. They cried, but that is not
unusual, they do that sometime. I checked on them and they were
OK.''
   The police say she added: ``I don't remember if I fed the kids
today or not. It might have been yesterday. I think I gave them
some water today.''
   Late that day, after she had slept some hours, she visited
Green, drank two beers and a half-pint of vodka, left and 20
minutes later called Green from a pay phone, according to police
reports and interviews.
   Sobbing, and with loud music playing in the background, ``she
said, `I need a drink bad.' She said she was having a lot of
problems, but she wouldn't say what,'' Green said.
   Not long afterwards, in the early evening, a few neighbors were
in a downstairs apartment when Miller ran to them crying, ``No! No!
My babies is dead, both of them.''
   Harris, the neighbor, ran upstairs and found the children on
their sides, ``staring at one another,'' he later testified. They
were pronounced dead at the local hospital.
   On Jan. 25, 1985, more than two years after her babies withered
away in their crib, Miller pleaded guilty to two counts of
manslaughter by negligence and two counts of failing to supply
adequate care and guidance.
   When it came time for sentencing, Assistant District Attorney
Elizabeth Scheibel urged Hampden County Superior Court Judge George
C. Keady Jr. to imprison Miller for an unspecified period, saying:
   ``Motherhood carries great responsibility and Miss Miller did
not live up to that responsibility. Here alcoholism should not
excuse what she did or didn't do.''
   ``I cannot disagree,'' Keady replied. ``I don't think we can
forget about these two children. Even back to pregnancy, these
children were at her mercy.''
   After the inquest, free on personal recognizance, Miller lived
for a time with her mother. She had another child, despite birth
control counseling.
   The boy, who recently turned 2, also failed to thrive under her
care. He was placed temporarily in a foster home and then put in
the custody of his grandmother, Audrey Young, joining Miller's
11-year-old daughter, who has lived with Young since infancy.
   ``She was an alcoholic, that was her problem,'' Young said about
her daughter. ``She was never a bad girl. I never had any problem
with her.''
   The nurse who tried to help Miller said alcohol counseling
simply failed.
   ``This was a case that more or less seemed to defeat the
system,'' Buell said. ``She couldn't be helped.''

19, last Sept. 3.
   Nash said he was serving a warrant at a southwest Atlanta

jumped the curb and crashed into a nearby house. A bullet struck
Montgomery in the back of the head; he died two days later.
   Slaton said he offered the grand jury a chance to indict Nash,
an eight-year law enforcement veteran, on murder and aggravated

   The mood in this 87-family neighborhood adjacent to the
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, already irritated about
losing a $1.3 million relocation grant after a city buyout, grew
surly when police shot Baxter Lee Williams on Feb. 27.
   Williams, 23, had just left a local hangout with his brother,
witnesses said. Police who saw the shooting said Williams pulled a
handgun, but no weapon was confiscated. Witnesses said Williams was
holding a beer can when he was killed; police found the beer can.
   In March, Fulton County District Attorney Lewis Slaton decided
not to prosecute the officer involved in the shooting. Residents
blasted Mayor Andrew Young at an April community meeting, saying
the mayor, a longtime civil rights leader, and his administration
had no concern for the city's poor.

   There were no witnesses to the April 8 shooting of Victor Long
behind a house on Fielding Lane, a shady street lined with
comfortable homes occupied by black, middle-class families.
   Long, in his 20s, was being chased by police when he was shot by
Officer R.S. Creasy. Creasy was patrolling a wooded area for a
burglary suspect when he saw Long sitting under a tree, trying to
catch his breath. Creasy, who said Long fit the description of his
suspect, chased Long through the woods, then tried to subdue him.
Long wrestled a second gun from a holster at Creasy's ankle, police
said, and Creasy shot Long five times.
   Lt. R.J. Anglin said several residents of the neighborhood,
which had been plagued by thefts, ``came out and patted us on the
back.'' Creasy was placed on mandatory 10-day administrative duties
pending the outcome of homicide and internal affairs investigations.

   Trouble at Bowen Homes on March 30 did not result in death but
did raise tension between police and the city's black citizens. An
attempt by two police officers to arrest Tommy George for a traffic
violation turned the normally quiet housing project chaotic.
   A crowd, described by police as large and unruly, gathered to
watch. Once George was handcuffed and put in a police car, Idella
Gibson, whose son was killed by police in 1974, demanded George's
release, then seemed to have a seizure, police said. George managed
to flee while the officers were attending Ms. Gibson. The crowd
then began throwing rocks and broken bottles, damaging several
police cars.
   A similar disturbance followed within days in the McDaniel-Glen
housing project. The next day, ministers working through the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference urged Slaton to reverse
his decision not to prosecute in the Williams shooting, hoping to
restore order in the housing projects.

<HEAD>When It Comes to Apples, Earl Butz Still Against Worms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earl L. Butz is noted for saying many things,
such as telling farmers decades ago to get bigger or get out. Or
advising them during the boom export years to plant fence-row to
fence-row.
   Another: God put the worm in the apple, man took it out.
   That was one of Butz's prime quips when he was secretary of
agriculture in the early 1970s during the Nixon and Ford
administrations. He used it often when environmentalists complained
about using too many chemicals on farm crops.
   Butz, who will be 79 on July 3, is still a favorite on the
agricultural speaking circuit. And he occasionally touches raw
nerves with his candor.
   Last fall, Butz was a guest commentator in the respected
quarterly magazine, Choices, which is published by the American
Agricultural Economics Association. As an economist and dean
emeritus of agriculture at Purdue University, Butz is right at home
among his professional colleagues.
   Butz wrote about one of his favorite topics, risk, and how
Americans live in a risk-filled world. Always have, he said, from
westward-bound prairie schooners to the ``heaven-bound rocket
Challenger of our day.''
   In those adventures, he said, some Americans lost their lives.
Yet all were driven to risk by ``the dream of something better than
what they already had'' or by the dream of greater reward if the
risk paid off.
   Butz said that a growing world population means that agriculture
must push even harder to produce more on a shrinking resource base.
In doing so, he said, ``Caution must be exercised that we don't go
overboard in our hysteria to clean up the environment and make
everything absolutely safe.''
   It means using more chemicals, not less, Butz said. It means a
vertical expansion ``into the realm of science'' in order to feed
the world. There should be more biotechnology, more antibiotics,
more pesticides _ more risk-taking, not less, he said.
   ``Modern agricuture cannot continue to produce adequate amounts
of safe and wholesome food without substantial use of chemicals and
antibiotics,'' he said.
   As Butz sees it, one of the problems is that two-thirds of
living Americans never had the experience of biting into a wormy
apple and, after seeing the worm hole, wonder whether they had
eaten the worm or whether it was still in the apple.
   ``Let's be honest about it,'' Butz said. ``God put the worm in
the apple; man took it out ... Man used poison to get it out _
deadly poison. But the good part is that you can't buy a bad apple
in your town today.''
   Butz said it is ``completely unacceptable to believe that there
is no way out of the problems we have created'' through chemicals
and other scientific means.
   ``Unquestionably, there are risks involved, but none so great as
the risk that we may quit risking, try vainly to set the clock
back, and abjectly surrender the goal of a better world is the
mistaken belief that this one is as good as can be,'' he said.
   Well!
   In the spring issue of the magazine, Butz was mauled by a couple
of letter-writing colleagues for some of his assertions.
   Peter D. Bloome of the University of Illinois said Butz is
correct about the futility of seeking a risk-free existence but
adds that ``we should not become cavalier'' about the risks
inherent in progress.
   ``I can deal with the worm in my apple,'' Bloome wrote. ``What I
cannot deal with in my apple _ or my drinking water _ is the poison
that killed the worm. I expect science to remove the worm from my
apple that involves an acceptable risk at an acceptable cost.''
   Brian Baker of the University of California said, ``Earl Butz
made me feel un-American. Perhaps I should start smoking and riding
a motorcycle without a helmet.''
   The goal of agricultural ecologists, he said, ``is not to turn
the clock back, but to design agricultural systems which are
sustainable, stable, and resilient, as well as productive.''
Biological, or natural, controls are preferable to contamination by
chemicals.
   Butz had the last word in a postscript, contending that the
comments ``largely reinforce the main thesis'' of what he had
written.
   ``Of course, we should pursue biological (natural) controls,''
he said. ``But let us not become so zealous in pursuit of that goal
that we discourage research in chemical controls ... we need both.''

<HEAD>Personal Income, Spending Both Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Healthy gains in Americans' personal incomes and consumer
spending last month indicate consumers have rebounded from last
October's stock market crash, economists say.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that personal incomes
climbed 0.8 percent in March after a 0.6 percent gain in February.
It was the biggest increase since an identical 0.8 percent advance
in December.
   Consumer spending jumped 0.7 percent in March, the government
reported.
   Analysts said spending and income figures indicated the
consumer, who cut back on purchases immediately following the
October stock market crash, had rebounded and was continuing to
propel overall economic growth.
   ``There is no serious consumer retrenchment going on. People are
still willing to buy,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the
Futures Group, an economic forecasting firm in Washington. ``We
shouldn't face any serious problem of a spending slump for the rest
of the year.''
   But the latest economic report had little impact in the
financial markets, where stock prices edged up, bond prices slipped
and the dollar edged lower.
   Oil prices ended lower after trading erratically on speculation
over the outcome of a meeting between OPEC and independent oil
producers. The non-OPEC nations have proposed that both groups cut
exports in order to help boost world oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June delivery contract
for West Texas Intermediate crude fell 33 cents a barrel to $18.27.
   The 0.8 percent March increase in incomes would have been a only
0.2 percent if special factors including an annual bonus for auto
workers had been excluded.
   The average $2,500 payment to 108,000 Ford Motor Co. employees
accounted for more than half of the increase in wages and salaries
last month, which rose 0.5 percent in March, the government said.
   In all, personal incomes rose $29.6 billion to a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $3.92 trillion. Personal
consumption spending, which includes virtually everything except
interest payments on debt, rose $21.8 billion to an annual rate of
$3.09 billion.
   Disposable, or after-tax, incomes were up as well, climbing 0.6
percent in March following a 0.8 percent February increase.
   Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable
income, dipped slightly last month to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent
in February, although both months showed an improvement from the
3.7 percent average savings rate in 1987.
   Spending rose in the categories of non-durable goods and
services. Durable goods, items such as cars that are expected to
last at least three years, edged down $300 million during March
after a huge $9.2 billion rise in February.
   But purchases of non-durable goods rose $9.8 billion while
purchases of services, which include housing costs, rose $12.2
billion.
   In other events, the Treasury Department sold $8.53 billion in
two-year notes at the highest yields in nearly four months.
   The average yield was 7.64 percent, up from 7.39 percent at the
last auction on March 31 and the highest since two-year notes
averaged 7.93 percent on Dec. 31.

   Oil prices seesawed and then slumped in a wild
trading session driven by speculation about the outcome of a
meeting between OPEC and independent oil exporters.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate crude jumped 12 cents per barrel to $18.72 by
noon Wednesday but tumbled late in the day and closed at $18.27,
down 33 cents from the previous close.
   Similar swings affected refined products traded on the exchange.
The near-month contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell .06
cent a gallon to 52.36 cents, and wholesale heating oil fell .27
cent a gallon to 51.77 cents.
   Traders said the market strengthened in early activity because
of indications that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and a group of non-cartel oil exporters, meeting in
Vienna, might agree on 5 percent production cuts aimed at
eliminating excess supplies and raising prices.
   But later rumors hit the market that key OPEC member Saudi
Arabia had walked out of the meeting. By another unconfirmed
account, the non-OPEC participants at the meeting had inflated
their production figures so the 5 percent output reduction proposal
would be largely meaningless.
   Some traders who had bought oil on the hunch that prices would
rise because of the meeting became nervous and sold, accelerating
the late-afternoon slide.
   Others said the market closed in a position to rally sharply if
the OPEC and non-OPEC bargainers can devise a production-cutting
pact. Some said prices easily could surge toward $19 a barrel.

   Yields on two-year Treasury notes rose in the
government's latest auction to the highest level in nearly four
months.
   The average yield was 7.64 percent on Wednesday, up from 7.39
percent at the last auction on March 31.
   It was the highest rate since two-year notes averaged 7.93

   About $8.53 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling
$26.08 billion.

<HEAD>Japan Calls Trade Bill Passage ``Extremely Regrettable''</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Trade Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese government warned Thursday that the
wide-ranging trade bill passed by the U.S. Congress could hurt
international economic growth.
   ``Japan strongly fears that if the bill is enacted in its
present form, it will have a serious impact on bilateral and
multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of
the world economy,'' said chief government spokesman Keizo Obuchi.
   The bill, which President Reagan repeatedly has threatened to
veto, toughens U.S. retaliatory measures against countries engaged
in unfair trade practices.
   It also would impose trade sanctions against Japan's Toshiba
Corp. for its subsidiary's sale of sensitive equipment to the
Soviet Union. The sales violated rules of the Coordinating
Committee for Export Control, a Paris-based group that regulates
Western high-technology exports to communist nations.
   Hajime Tamura, minister of international trade and industry,
said the Toshiba sanctions were regrettable because COCOM
regulations provide that each member country has responsibility for
ensuring compliance by companies within its borders.
   The Senate approved the bill and sent it to Reagan by a vote of
63-36, less than the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
The president's key objection is to a provision requiring employers
to give advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs.
   ``It is extremely regrettable that...the U.S. Senate, following
the House of Representatives, passed the Omnibus Trade Bill which
contains provisions problematical for Japan,'' Obuchi stated. ``The
government of Japan strongly hopes that such a bill will not
finally be enacted.''
   On Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita also
warned that the bill could damage the global economy, and said
Japan would try to restrain growing protectionism in the United
States by improving its ties with Europe.

<HEAD>Chrysler Delays Kenosha Closing, Transfer of K-car to Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By backtracking from earlier
proposals to close an assembly plant and move some auto production
to Mexico, Chrysler Corp. has revived hopes of a quick end to early
contract talks, union negotiators say.
   The automaker announced Wednesday it would delay for several
months the planned closing of its Kenosha, Wis. assembly plant and
the transfer of K-car assembly work to Mexico.
   Union displeasure over the K-car plan, Chrysler's initial
contract proposals and other developments had helped sour and bog
down the talks, which were begun earlier than usual to help ease
growing friction between the company and the United Auto Workers.
   Following Wednesday's announcements, UAW Vice President Marc
Stepp said union bargainers were ready to negotiate into the night
and through the weekend to make up for lost time.
   ``I hope Lee Iacocca would stick around and watch this
management in terms of how they perform so at least we can sit down
and negotiate a contract within the next seven to 10 days
peacefully without some other stupid announcement that this company
is now becoming very famous for,'' Stepp said.
   Many union members were angered last week when Chrysler
confirmed reports that it planned to shift K-car production from
Detroit to Mexico in July.
   The Kenosha closing has been a sore point since Chrysler
announced in January that it would close the 5,500-worker plant in
September, despite earlier indications to workers and Wisconsin
officials that it would be kept open another five years.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca attributed the decisions to delay
the moves to better-than-expected sales of K-cars and of cars built
at Kenosha.
   The union also had been miffed by Chrysler's contract proposals,
which veered sharply from a job-protecting industry-pattern
contract established last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors
Corp.
   On Monday, as the union was considering breaking off
negotiations, Iacocca met with UAW President Owen Bieber and later
with Chrysler managers and negotiators in an effort to get the
talks back on track.
   ``I think we've got to cut out the rhetoric and get down to
work'' on contract negotiations, Iacocca said Wednesday.
   Talks on the contract, which expires Sept. 14 and covers 66,000
active workers in 15 states, opened April 18, four months early.
Both sides hoped an early settlement could mend hostility over the
Kenosha closing and over Chrysler's aborted attempt to sell its
Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary earlier this year.
   Chrysler had planned to close the former American Motors Corp.
plant in Kenosha in September. Phase-out was scheduled to begin in
July, when production of the Omni-Horizon was to be moved from
Kenosha to Detroit's Jefferson Avenue assembly plant.
   Chrysler also planned to end U.S. K-car production when the
Omni-Horizon was moved to Detroit and a Newark, Del., assembly
plant was converted from K-car production to building the K-car's
replacement. A plant in Toluca, Mexico was to fill orders for
1989-model Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant K-cars.
   Instead, Kenosha will build the Omni-Horizon and other cars in
Kenosha until December, giving workers up to a six-month respite.
The K-car will stay in Detroit until the Omni-Horizon is moved
there in January.
   Iacocca left open the possibility of boosting K-car imports from
Mexico in beginning in January. But Stepp said adoption of the
industry pattern contract at Chrysler before then would make it
easier for the union to combat such a move.

<HEAD>Experts Say China Can't Reach Grain Output Goals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agricultural experts have said the government's
goal of producing 450 million tons of grain annually by 1990 will
be impossible to attain, the official China Daily reported Thursday.
   Speakers at a meeting this week organized by the China Crops
Association said it would be at least 1992 before the nation's
farmers reach the 450-million ton target.
   Increasing grain output has been made a top priority of the
Beijing government following three straight years of disappointing
harvests.
   In 1987 the nation produced 402 million tons, up from 391
million in 1986 but still below the record 407 million tons in 1984.
   Premier Li Peng has said China must increase output to 500
million tons by the year 2000 merely to keep up with population
growth.
   Grain production has stagnated in recent years as farmers,
unhappy with low government-set prices for grains, turned to more
lucrative cash crops such as vegetables, while some landholders
gave up farming and used their land to erect small factories.
   The government has tried to encourage farmers to grow grain by
boosting prices and giving priority to grain farmers in allotments
of fertilizer and fuel.
   Experts at the conference also recommended that efforts be made
to increase yields and open up about 3 million hectares, roughly
7.5 million acres, of virgin land by the year 2000. They said China
will try to sow about 13 million hectares of high-yield hybrid rice
by the turn of the century.

<HEAD>Bank Of Korea Reports Record Current Account Surplus In March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boosted by strong exports, South
Korea's current account surplus grew to a record $1.18 billion in
March, the Bank of Korea said today.
   The latest figure shows a substantial increase from February's
surplus of $970 million and the $884 million surplus of March 1987.
   South Korea's previous monthly record surplus was $1.12 billion
for last September.
   The current account largely measures a nation's trade in
merchandise and services.
   The central bank said the surplus in the January-March quarter
widened to $2.95 billion from $2.12 billion in the same period last
year. But bank officials predicted that the surplus would decline
in coming months because of further import liberalization moves by
the government.
   The surplus in merchandise trade rose to $863 million in March
from $632 million a year earlier. The first quarter trade surplus
rose to $2.32 billion from $1.52 billion in the same period last
year.
   Officials said merchandise exports increased 32.9 percent in
March from one year ago to $4.77 billion and imports rose 32.1
percent to $3.91 billion.
   Merchandise exports in the January-March period rose 37.7
percent to $12.9 billion and imports rose 35.5 percent to $10.58
billion.

<HEAD>Tate & Lyle Sweetens Bid For Staley; May Have To Go Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British sugar producer Tate & Lyle PLC may have
to sweeten its $1.42 billion buyout bid for Staley Continental Inc.
even further if it hopes to win the Illinois-based corn syrup
maker, according to one industry analyst.
   Tate & Lyle increased its offer for Staley to $35 a share from
$32 a share, or a total of $1.33 billion, on Wednesday.
   Staley rose 50 cents to $37 a share Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Industry analysts had said Tate & Lyle's initial bid for
Staley's 30.4 million common shares outstanding plus its preferred
stock was well below the company's fair market price, which some
estimated could be up to $40 a share.
   The new offer ``indicates the seriousness by Tate & Lyle to make
a deal with Staley,'' said Clinton Mayer III, an analyst in New
York with Bear Stearns Inc. ``The $32 bid was unrealistic. This
(new) offer is moving toward realism.''
   Staley, based in the Chicago suburb of Rolling Meadows, declined
comment on the new offer.
   ``We haven't seen anything on it yet. And until we receive
something on it, we can't make any comment,'' Staley spokesman G.
David Satterfield said late Wednesday afternoon.
   London-based Tate & Lyle, England's second-largest sugar
refiner, initially offered $32 a share for Staley on April 8.
   Staley, the United States' second-largest refiner of corn
sweeteners behind Decatur-based Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., urged
its stockholders on April 21 to reject Tate & Lyle's offer but
indicated it would consider other takeover bids.
   Tate & Lyle, which owns about 5 percent of Staley's stock, wants
to acquire the company for its A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners.
   Staley was based in Decatur until about three years ago, and the
British company has promised to move Staley's headquarters back
there if its acquisition attempt succeeds.
   Staley Continental also owns CFS Continental Inc., a leading
food-service supplier that it acquired in early 1985.

   Now that rival oil producers have offered
OPEC the help it sought for years, the cartel seems unsure how to
use it.
   Mexico, China and four smaller independent oil producers offered
to cut their exports by 5 percent if the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries makes a proportionally similar sacrifice.
   All the OPEC members say they're pleased the offer was made, but
few said whether they like the idea.
   Oil ministers from all 13 OPEC member countries arranged a
meeting tonight to decide what to do about the proposal.
   Some analysts say the plan, if accepted by OPEC and implemented
by all 19 countries involved, probably would push oil prices up to
OPEC's target of $18 a barrel. Most OPEC crudes are selling in the
open market for $16 a barrel or less.
   The oil market in Europe was unsettled and slightly weaker today
in early trading, London-based traders said.
   The price of Brent crude from the North Sea was down 25 cents,
at $17.25 a barrel, roughly matching declines in late New York
trading on Wednesday.
   Analysts said the market appeared to be viewing the OPEC talks
as only a prelude to more crucial negotiations in June, when the
cartel may face tough decisions about cutting production by larger
amounts to avert a price slide.
   ``For now they're just firefighting,'' said Paul McDonald, a
London-based oil consultant.
   Prices fell Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
June contract West Texas Intermediate, the most widely traded U.S.
crude, fell 33 cents to $18.27 a barrel.
   Paul Mlotok, who monitored the OPEC talks for the New York-based
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc., said the nations were on
target for a possible agreement to boost prices.
   But Mlotok acknowledged that OPEC rarely makes decisions about
reducing its oil production or its exports without long, often
unproductive negotiations.
   Iran, a leading advocate of production cuts to help boost
prices, said on Wednesday that it supported the independent
producers' proposal.
   When a reporter asked Libyan Oil Minister Fawzi Shakshuki if his
government could accept the plan, he replied: ``It depends.'' He
didn't elaborate.
   Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC president and oil minister of Nigeria,
sought to evade reporters' questions about his country's position
on the export-cutting plan.
   He stressed that this was the first time a group of non-OPEC oil
producers offered to restrain production as a gesture of
cooperation with the cartel.
   ``It's a good proposal in that it's a proposal that we've never
had before,'' he said.
   The position of Saudi Arabia, the cartel's largest producer and
the world's biggest oil exporter, was equally unclear.
   At one point Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told reporters,
``We'd like greater participation'' in oil export cuts by
independent producers. He declined to say if his government favored
the proposal before OPEC.
   At another point, when asked if he thought OPEC would accept the
offer, he replied: ``We haven't done anything yet.''
   Six OPEC oil ministers met with representatives of the non-OPEC
countries on Wednesday to review the export-cutting plan. The
independent producers envison reductions of 200,000 barrels daily
in their exports and about 700,000 barrels a day in OPEC's exports.
   After their meeting the two groups said they shared a desire to
see stability in oil prices and found ``much common ground in their
analysis'' of the world oil market situation.
   They stopped short of saying they agreed on how price stability
could be achieved, but sought to stress the importance of the
meeting between OPEC and rival producers.
   ``It constitutes the beginning of a new stage of cooperation
between a large number of oil-producing countries,'' the groups
stated.
   The six non-OPEC countries involved are Mexico, China, Malaysia,
Egypt, Angola and Oman. Colombia took part in the talks but said it
would not join in the proposed export cuts.

   Authorities today said nearly 3,000 people
had died in the 1984 Bhopal disaster and estimated that more than
1,700 more will die over the next seven years as a result of the
gas leak.
   The figures were contained in a new relief plan that will
provide $285 million in economic and medical aid to victims of
toxic methyl-isocyanate gas released by a plant owned by a Union
Carbide Corp. subsidiary.
   The plan, released by the government of central Madhya Pradesh
state, said 2,998 people had died in the world's worst industrial
accident. Previous estimates had put the death toll at 2,800.
   The plan also suggests that 250 deaths will occur annually over
the next seven years as a result of the gas leak. The projection
was the first official attempt at estimate the number of future
deaths from the disaster.
   The government already has spent $46 million on relief for
victims of the toxic cloud, which was released at 1 a.m. on Dec. 3,
1984 by the pesticide plant and spread over nearby shantytowns and
into the city of Bhopal.
   Many gas victims have breathing problems that become
progressively worse and ultimately cause death. Others will become
ill with diseases whose symptoms include fever, vomiting and
diarrhea.
   Union Carbide, headquartered in Danbury, Conn., faces two legal
actions in India. India is suing it for $3 billion in damages in a
civil action being heard in Bhopal and has launched a criminal case
against the company, several of its subsidiaries and current and
former officers.
   On April 4, the Madhya Pradesh high court ordered Union Carbide
to pay $192 million in interim relief to gas victims.
   Federal and state coffers will provide the money for the new
economic and medical assistance for the gas victims, state
officials said. The interim relief, when paid, will be used for
other purposes, they said.
   Robert D. Kennedy, chairman of Union Carbide, told the company's
annual meeting in Danbury on Wednesday the company has not decided
whether to appeal the ruling.
   The Indian government currently is sorting through 500,000
injury and loss claims to determine which are valid. More than
20,000 people are known to have sustained serious injuries in the
leak.
   Among those scheduled to get financial aid under the new plan
are 509 women widowed by the gas leak and 27 children who were
orphaned.
   The plan sets aside $192,000 per year for financial relief to
the families of those who die as a result of the disaster.
   Since the government pays $770 in lump-sum relief for each
death, the government is anticipating 250 additional deaths each
year for the next seven years, said state officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The plan does not explain the basis for the estimate, and said
spending could be higher because ``it is not possible to assess the
long-term damage.''
   It also says a special unit will be set up to conduct scientific
investigations into the long-range effects of the gas.
   India contends the gas leak was caused by negligence. Union
Carbide has said it resulted from sabotage by a distruntled
employee.
   Efforts to reach an out-of-court settlement in the civil case
failed last November, although both sides agreed to continue
talking informally.
   According to sources close to the talks last fall, Union Carbide
had offered slightly more than $500 million to try to settle the
case.
   Kennedy said on Wednesday the company is spending between $7
million and $8 million annually on expenses from the Bhopal
litigation.

<HEAD>Morosky Expects Top Leaders Will Go</HEAD>

   Federated Department Stores Inc. Chairman
Howard Goldfeder and other top executives are expected to leave the
company soon after Campeau Corp. assumes control, incoming Chairman
Robert Morosky says.
   ``Most of the key executives have indicated they will take their
golden parachutes,'' Morosky, now president of Campeau-owned Allied
Stores Corp., said Wednesday.
   ``Golden parachutes'' are generous separation benefits commonly
given senior executives of corporations that become takeover
targets.
   While all decisions have not been made, Morosky said ``the top
six or so'' Federated executives will probably depart.
   Employment contracts between the company and the top executives
require that each receive three years' salary and 20 percent of
individual pay for incentive compensation upon leaving the company.
   For Goldfeder, that amounts to $3.06 million, plus another $3.9
million in deferred compensation, or $6.96 million.
   Other top executives, their severance payments and deferred
compensation listed in the proxy statement are Norman Matthews,
president and chief operating officer, $2.85 million; John W.
Burden III, vice chairman, $2.31 million; Will M. Storey, vice
chairman, $2.4 million; and Allen I. Questrom, vice chairman, $3.15
million.
   The figures do not include pensions and other benefits.
   During the heat of the takeover battle for Cincinnati-based
Federated in February, the Federated board of directors funded
trust agreements totaling $28.35 million for top executives with
severance contracts.
   Goldfeder had indicated earlier he planned to leave the company
if a competing bid by R.H. Macy & Co. were successful.
   A Federated representative said it was premature to comment on
which of the company's senior managers would leave.
   Campeau's $73.30-a-share tender offer for all outstanding
Federated stock will expire Friday at 5 p.m.
   Completion of the $6.75 billion tender offer will brings to an
end Toronto-based Campeau's three-month struggle to acquire the
nation's fifth-largest retailer. It also will be the first step in
the merger of Federated into Campeau.
   Campeau indicated that completing the merger would take at least
a month, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
this week.

   The European Economic Community today
threatened to take action against the United States under
international trade rules if the U.S. Trade Bill comes into force.
   EEC Commissioner for External Trade Willy de Clercq said in a
statement that the Community ``will react,'' using its rights under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, ``each time its
interests are harmed by the unilateral measures taken by the
American authorities.''
   However, the EEC threat depends on whether President Ronald
Reagan vetoes the Trade Bill.
   De Clercq said that the EEC will ``follow carefully legislative
developments'' in the U.S. A spokeswoman for De Clercq told
reporters that it ``waiting to see what happens next'' before
making any specific moves.
   She said that Reagan had 10 days to decide whether or not to
veto the bill.
   The spokeswoman said that the EC objects to a number of
provisions in the trade bill which it considers to be protectionist
and to harm EEC interests.
   She said that these provisions include:
   _Widening the power of the U.S. trade representative to
investigate alleged unfair trade practices and to order retaliatory
action.
   _Threatening foreign companies' access to the U.S.

<HEAD>Tariff Cuts Planned For Wine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to reduce
import tariffs on wine from the present 100 percent to levels
between 30 percent to 40 percent, officials said Thursday.
   But South Korea will reject U.S. demands for abolition of wine
import quota restrictions, saying domestic wineries were not yet
competitive and needed protection, officials at the Finance
Ministry said.
   The issue is just one of several that officials of both
countries discuss in talks set to begin here Monday. The United
States hopes to bring trade between the two countries more into
balance. Last year the total amounted to $10 in South Korea's favor.
   U.S. officials are also expected to press this country to lift
its import ban on beef and further open its market for cigarettes
and other American products and services.
   South Korean officials said the government planned to ease
import inspections and facilitate customs clearance of wine imports.
   Under foreign pressure, particularly from the United States,
South Korea began allowing imports of foreign wine last October.
But it imposed quotas limiting imports to 20 percent of total
domestic consumption this year, to 30 percent in 1989 and 40
percent in 1990 before fully opening the market in 1991.
   Korean imports of wine in the first quarter amounted to 116
kiloliters worth $334,000, according to official statistics.
   On the beef issue, Kim Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition
party, said at a news conference Thursday that his party opposed
U.S. demands for abolition of the import ban.
   Kim said South Korean farmers ``should not be made scapegoats
for the U.S. trade deficit.''
   He said American beef sales here would do little to cut that
deficit, and the United States instead should apply trade pressure
on companies that export to the United States.
   Kim said in principle, his Party for Peace and Democracy
supported the idea of free trade.
   ``But there is an exception for agricultural products. Even in
the United States there is a certain amount of protection
concerning their farm products. This is the case everywhere,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Former CBOT Trader Jailed Pending Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a former bond futures
trader held without bond pending his trial on charges of conducting
illegal trades at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Daniel Dewey, 39, is accused of wearing a wig, phony trading
jacket and false badges to trade in the CBOT's U.S. Treasury Bond
futures pit.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen on Wednesday scheduled a June
23 trial date for Dewey and for co-defendant Thompson B. Sanders,
45.
   Both Dewey and Sanders are charged with one count of conspiracy
to commit wire fraud and wire fraud, and four counts of violating
federal commodity statutes.
   Dewey, of Ashville, N.C., failed to appear at his arraignment
but was arrested two weeks ago by police in Miami on a warrant
issued by Aspen.
   Dewey and Sanders, along with David Pelleu, 45, and Dan Kolton,
24, were indicted by a federal grand jury in February on charges
they played various roles in effecting the illegal trading scheme.
   Since then, Pelleu and Kolton have pleaded guilty to conspiracy
and wire fraud charges as part of an agreement entered into with
federal prosecutors.
   The two have agreed to testify against Dewey and Sanders and to
cooperate in the government's investigation of alleged wrongdoing
at the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

<HEAD>British Chemical Giant's Profit Gains; Volcker Named Board Member</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said Thursday its
first-quarter pre-tax profit gained 7.2 percent over the 1987
period because of strong demand for its products.
   Separately, the company announced that Paul Volcker, former
chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, is to join the ICI
board of directors as a non-executive director on June 1.
   ICI said its net profit jumped 13.3 percent to 213 million
pounds, or $400 million, from 188 million pounds, or $353 million .
   Revenue rose 6.5 percent to 2.94 billion pounds, or $5.5
billion, from 2.76 billion pounds, or $5.2 billion.
   The company injected a cautionary note in its earnings report
about currency exchange trends. In the latest period, foreign
exchange fluctuations cut revenue by 2 percent, it said.
   ``Although the current world business climate is good, currency
movements are having an impact on profits,'' ICI said.
   In the first quarter of 1988, sterling was 19 percent higher
against the dollar than a year earlier and was up 6 percent against
the Deutsche mark. The pound has since risen even further against
both these currencies, ICI noted.
   The company said its main businesses ``continued to experience
strong demand ... and recorded firm profits.'''
   This included an excellent contribution from operations of the
former Stauffer Chemical Co. of the United States, acquired by ICI
last June, ICI said.
   About Volcker's appointment to the board, ICI Chairman Denys
Henderson said in a statement: ``This is an appointment of
considerable significance to ICI's international business and Mr.
Volcker will make a special contribution to the strategic thinking
of the group in the field of finance and economic affairs.''
   Volcker said in a statement, ``The role of global financial
markets is of increasing importance to companies such as ICI and I
look forward to contributing my views in this area and on the wider
economic scene.''

<HEAD>Big Board Executive Says Stricter Disclosure Rules Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange is working on rules
that would require member brokerages to disclose the identity of
every customer they conduct trades for, a senior Big Board official
has disclosed.
   Such rules, designed to strengthen the exchange's
self-regulatory powers over trading abuses, could enmesh the
securities industry in controversy because of the historic
relationship of privacy between brokers and customers.
   Under present rules, the NYSE's market surveillance unit must
ask member firms for the identities of customers believed to be
involved in questionable trading. Such requests are often
excessively time-consuming.
   Richard Grasso, the NYSE's executive vice president, disclosed
the plans for tighter rules Wednesday in testimony before the
Senate Agriculture Committee, which has been holding hearings into
progress on remedies to prevent another stock market crash. The
committee oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which
regulates stock-futures trading.
   ``In the longer term, we will be proposing rules that will
require, for regulatory purposes, that firms maintain a back-end
process to identify beneficial owners. This will assist the
exchange in performing its oversight and self-regulatory
responsibilities,'' Grasso said.
   ``I want to emphasize the long-term nature of implementing such
rules for identifying beneficial owners. That's because of the
enormous amount of computer program changes that will have to be
made by the firms themselves and the need to coordinate any new
rules of this kind with other self-regulatory organizations,
clearing and depository institutions and other relevant security
industry participants,'' he said.
   Elaborating on the proposal in an interview with the Wall Street
Journal, Grasso said member firms would electronically report the
identities of customers to the Big Board, probably the day after
the transaction, when buy and sell orders are matched during the
period for settling trades.
   ``The market wouldn't know who the customer is,'' he was quoted
as syaing. ``We would have it (the customer's identity) only for
regulatory purposes.''
   The Journal said Grasso indicated the Big Board is concerned
about customer resistance and acknowledged that the proposal would
require ``customer education.''
   The NYSE's market-surveillance unit scrutinizes daily trading
via computers that are designed to alert exchange investigators
about transactions that suggest possible insider trading or market
manipulation.
   If a suspicious trade is detected, the surveillance unit will
call the brokers involved for more information and sometimes refers
the material to the Securities and Exchange Commission for further
investigation.

   Dillard Department Stores Inc. and
shopping center developer Edward J. DeBartolo are expanding their
joint holdings with the purchase of the Pittsburgh-based Joseph
Horne Co. chain.
   Dillard and DeBartolo reached an agreement in principle to buy
the 17-store chain, according to Maverick Fund I, a limited
partnership that is the majority shareholder in Horne.
   The agreement was announced by Maverick Wednesday.
   No price was given for the transaction. The chain is believed to
have drawn a price of $150 million or slightly more when May
Department Stores Co. sold it to Maverick and Horne management in
1986.
   Dillard and DeBartolo have already teamed up to buy the 14-store
Higbee's chain based in Cleveland.
   Horne is the second-largest department store chain in
Pittsburgh, based on 1987 sales figures. The largest is Kauffman's,
a 14-store group owned by May.
   May acquired Horne as part of its purchase of Associated Dry
Goods in 1986. Reacting to concerns over eliminating competition in
the Pittsburgh department store market, May sold the chain so it
could maintain its Kauffman's stores.
   Horne management is believed to retain about a third interest in
the chain.
   Dillard has grown rapidly through acquisition in recent years,
buying chains in Texas, Tennessee, Missouir, Oklahoma, Arizona and
Kansas, as well as the Higbee stores in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   None of the markets made much of a move in either direction in
the early going and analysts attributed the quiet opening to a lack
of fresh news.
   ``After a runup Tuesday in the soybean complex, I see the

looking for some new fundamental information to give them some
direction,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Weather forecasts for the coming six to 10 days predicted normal
moisture for the U.S. Corn Belt, making conditions more favorable
for planting, Spilka said.
   Soybeans opened mostly lower, corn was fractionally higher and
wheat was nearly unchanged.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to \ cent lower with the

<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo,
irresistible cost-cutting force of the airline industry, has
smacked into a seemingly immovable object at Eastern Airlines _
veteran Machinists leader Charles E. Bryan.
   Bryan, a philosopher-mechanic who admits to being ``kind of a
cornball sometimes,'' bases his strategies on his self-teachings in
Yoga, Zen, the Bible and history.
   ``It's kind of a Gandhi approach, or Martin Luther King. If you
continue to be right, it's pretty hard for your adversary to
overcome,'' Bryan said in a recent interview.
   While the 55-year-old West Virginia native quotes Khalil Gibran
and gets misty-eyed over the selfless nobility of King Arthur and
Sir Lancelot in ``Camelot,'' his favorite movie, his union members
relish the more-familiar image of those same dark blue eyes
flashing fire, and Bryan's voice rising in anger as he argues his
points.
   Prominent in his small, cluttered office in an
industrial-warehouse area west of the Miami International Airport
is a plaque given him by his members showing Bryan, in a news
photo, angrily pointing his finger during the Eastern shareholders
meeting that approved Lorenzo's takeover.
   The president since 1979 of Machinists District 100,
representing 12,000, or more than one-third, of Eastern's
employees, Bryan was blamed by former Eastern Chairman Frank Borman
for forcing the 1986 sale of the troubled carrier to Houston-based
Texas Air. Borman once questioned Bryan's sanity.
   On April 13, Borman, vice chairman of Texas Air, appeared with
Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes at a Washington news
conference aimed at countering a growing image that Texas Air
management is harassing employees and running unsafe airlines.
   ``The intransigence and unresponsiveness of the IAM are the most
serious obstacles to a successful conclusion of Eastern's internal
restructuring,'' Borman told reporters, citing his own experience
at trying to work with the Machinists leadership.
   Bryan responded: ``I would be delighted to sit down with Frank
Lorenzo and have an open discussion with the whole world watching.
He can bring Borman along. I don't think he'll ever have the
courage to do that. He couldn't deal with reality and the facts.''
   Lorenzo's takeover of Eastern, which teetered near bankruptcy,
chilled many employees. In 16 years from his Houston base, Lorenzo
has become a bogeyman for airline unions, a reputation solidified
in 1983 when he took his Continental Airlines into bankruptcy
reorganization. He voided contracts, slashed salaries, laid off a
third of the work force and got the carrier flying again despite a
pilots' strike.
   Bryan, though, sent Lorenzo a congratulatory telegram after the
Eastern sale and asked for a meeting to discuss cooperation. He
never got a response, he said.
   Instead, Bryan and flight attendants union head Robert V.
Callahan lost their seats on the board of directors; Bryan had to
turn in his directors' gold badge, which he wanted as a souvenir,
and he lost flying privileges. He later received a letter
threatening his firing for meeting with union members on company
property.
   Bryan had frequent meetings with Borman during the 15 years at
Eastern of the former astronaut _ who once awed Bryan _ but he says
he's never heard a word from Lorenzo and has gotten no more than
``a cold-fish handshake'' from Bakes.
   His letters to top executives, he says, are invariably answered
by staffers.
   ``They've tried to diminish me to the lowest common
denominator,'' Bryan said. ``But if there's anything that's driven
our union together, it's the way they've tried to discredit me
personally.''
   Bryan believes that management, after failing to extract cuts of
up to 50 percent in salaries for baggage handlers and other
non-mechanics in his union, wanted to force a strike, keep the
carrier flying with replacement workers, and crush the union.
   Bryan claims that rising numbers of firings and grievances have
been designed to ``provoke a wildcat strike so they can fire
everybody.''
   ``But everyone has been beautiful in following our philosophy,
our direction to keep doing a good job and not react to the harsh
treatment,'' said Bryan, re-elected last year with 82 percent of
the vote.
   There's been more to the Machinists' effort than passive
resistance. Bryan, who also has a 16-person union staff, has a
consultant who keeps a database compiling any corporate activity by
Texas Air, such as filings with federal agencies or court
depositions, anything that provides information on the
close-to-the-vest management.
   The union has attorneys in Miami, Palm Beach, New York and
Washington keeping up with myriad lawsuits, including a recent
Machinists' suit charging management with trying to dismantle
Eastern and violating security and federal labor laws, and asked
for the courts to reverse the Lorenzo takeover.
   Last year, the Machinists won a federal ruling preventing
Eastern from having an independent company take over some ground
service work, and in March, another ruling blocked the announced
spin-off of Eastern's profitable Northeast shuttle into a Texas Air
subsidiary.
   And persistent charges by Eastern's pilots and Machinists were
blamed by management for the current Federal Aviation
Administration safety inspections of Eastern and Continental and
for the Transportation Department's unusual study of Texas Air's
ability to run airlines.
   ``Frank Lorenzo has run into a smart cookie,'' said Callahan,
who left Eastern after losing a re-election bid in the flight
attendants union. ``Charlie Bryan is not a wild man _ he's a very
deliberate, intelligent, motivated man who has been carefully
portrayed otherwise by corporations fearful of his populist
appeal.''
   Callahan, a one-time George Washington University social
historian and now director of promotions at the University of Miami
Rosenstiel School of Marine Sciences, says the conflict at Eastern
``isn't a clash of egos _ it's a clash of ideologies.''
   Bryan, a divorced father of three who says he last vacationed 10
years ago, is dedicating his 70-hour weeks (at $63,879 a year)
these days to heading off Lorenzo every place he can.
   Management insists that Bryan is being stubbornly short-sighted
and that the money-losing carrier can't go on with baggage handlers
earning an average $47,000.
   Bryan says such averages are caused by mismanagement, because
workers are working too much overtime. He charges management has
intentionally created such averages to try to divide his union
between the 6,000 mechanics and the other, lesser-skilled workers.
   ``When mechanics ask me why we don't have separate unions, I
tell them there are a lot of reasons, but the best one is that's
what Frank Lorenzo wants,'' Bryan said. ``It's the first step in a
divide-and-conquer strategy. I will never sacrifice those workers'
quality of life.''
   Bryan says he wants only what's best for his members and the
airline he went to work for in 1956. He believes employees should
have important influence, even controlling influence, in their
companies.
   ``A lot of people identify me with Don Quixote,'' Bryan said.
``But I never believe any of these dreams is impossible.''

<HEAD>Bank Of NY Says It Holds Majority Stake In Irving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New York Co. said today that it holds a
majority of the shares of Irving Bank Corp., the target of its
hostile $1 billion-plus takeover bid.
   The company said that as of the close of business Wednesday,
9.03 million of Irving's approximately 18.5 million shares
outstanding common shares had been tendered to the Bank of New York.
   Those, along with the 888,634 shares Bank of New York already
owns, give it 53.96 percent of Irving's outstanding shares, it said.
   Irving spokesman David Santos said his company had no immediate
comment on Bank of New York's announcement.
   Bank of New York is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 of its common
shares for each of the outstanding Irving shares it doesn't already
own. The tender offer, which has been extended three times and set
to expire Friday, began last month after regulatory approval.
   Bank of New York also is running a slate of 16 nominees to
Irving's board of directors.
   Irving, however, has been urging its shareholders to back a
complex restructuring plan as an alternative to Bank of New York's
offer.
   Part of that plan includes selling Milan-based Banca Commerciale
Italiana, Italy's second largest bank, a 45 percent stake in the
company for $75 a share. Banca Commerciale also would have the
right to buy an additional 10 percent of Irving stock on the open
market after the deal was consummated.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs with Reagan objections to plant closing
provision; Picks up 2nd graf pvs, ``This bill isn't. Removes last
four grafs pvs to shorten.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan today renewed his opposition
to a plant-closing provision of the trade bill, saying Congress
should not legislate a requirement that companies warn workers of
planned shutdowns.
   Shortly after his top trade negotiator repeated Reagan's plan to
veto the just-passed trade legislation, the president was asked
what quarrel he had with the worker-notification provision.
   ``As an old labor union president, I suggest that's a matter
that belongs in the management-labor contracts between the unions
and the people,'' the president said. Reagan was questioned as he
greeted Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for a private lunch.
   Reagan is a former president of the Screen Actors Guild.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said earlier that
Reagan would veto the massive trade bill but congressional
Democrats called on the president to ``rethink his position'' and
sign the measure.
   ``This bill isn't dead yet,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters today. ``The ball is in the White
House court. If there is a demise of this bill it will occur at the
White House, not here.''
   House officials said it would be next week before the 1,000-page
bill could be put into proper form and delivered to the White
House. Reagan would then have 10 days to either sign it or veto it.
   The bill would increase the power of the U.S. trade
representative to act against other countries that use unfair trade
practices, make it easier to curb imports, repeal the windfall
profits tax on oil companies, and increase agricultural subsidies.
   Yeutter said Reagan will veto the bill because of the
controversial plant-closing provision. He urged that the Senate
eliminate that provision ``very quickly.''
   ``We need a trade bill this year,'' Yeutter said on NBC-TV's
``Today'' program.
   ``There are a lot of good things in that legislation, so if a
couple of necessary corrections are made and the bill comes back,
I'm really quite confident the president would sign it,'' Yeutter
said in another interview on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Byrd, however, said the Senate had only about 90 legislative
days left this year and had a heavy schedule. Asked if it would
accept proposed changes from the White House, Byrd said, ``we're
not spoon-fed from the White House.''
   ``I hope the president will rethink his position and come down
on the side of the American people,'' Byrd said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, pleaded for Reagan to sign
the bill, which he said has overwhelming popularity across the
country.
   ``There has to be a warm side to the president,'' he said. ``I
can't believe it falls on deaf ears or a flinty heart.''
   Wright said Reagan's promise to veto the bill was made to
``captains of industry'' who would understand if he changed his
mind.
   But Byrd said, ``The White House doesn't want this bill. The
White House doesn't want any trade bill.''
   The governments of Japan and Korea today urged Reagan to veto
the measure. There was also a warning from the European Economic
Community of retaliatory action if Reagan doesn't kill it.
   Japan's chief government spokesman, Keizo Obuchi, said the bill
which imposes sanctions against Toshiba Corp. may hinder world
economic development. ``The government of Japan strongly hopes that
such a bill will not finally be enacted,'' said Obuchi.
   South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim Hwang-kyung said the
bill would hinder international trade and the government hopes the
Reagan administration ``will take appropriate actions in line with
its much publicized stand on the bill.''
   Willy de Clercq, EEC commissioner for external trade, said the
EEC ``will react'' to measures in the bill it considers
protectionist and harmful to European interests if Reagan does not
veto it.
   The Senate approved the bill 63-36 Wednesday. That left
Democrats at least three votes short of the two-thirds majority
needed to enact their version over Reagan's objections.
   The bill would get Reagan's signature, said Yeutter, if it were
not for the provision, strongly backed by Democrats and labor,
requiring companies to give workers 60 days notice of intended
plant closings.
   Only 11 Republicans voted in favor of the measure produced after
three years of congressional debate over soaring U.S. trade
deficits. One Democrat voted against the measure _ Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., who criticized a provision easing the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.
   ``I believe that this bill is dead,'' said Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo., a GOP sponsor. He and other supporters held out
hope, however, that a revised version might pass later this year.
   The centerpiece of the bill would overhaul the system under
which the United States retaliates against trade law violations. It
would transfer authority to act from the president to the U.S.
trade representative.
   It also would streamline the system under which the United
States imposes import curbs to protect U.S. industries threatened
by foreign-made goods.
   Other provisions range from billions of dollars in agricultural
subsidies to repeal of the oil profits tax. Also included are
sanctions against Toshiba of Japan and Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk of
Norway for selling submarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet
Union.
   Federal aid for those left jobless by imports would be expanded
under the bill, which calls for a 0.15 percent import fee to pay
for the program.
   Curbs on overseas shipment of high-tech equipment would be
eased. The government would be barred from buying goods from
countries that freeze out U.S. exports and the president empowered
to halt any corporate merger or takeover on national security
grounds.

<HEAD>Oil Cartel: Real Menace Or Just Bogeyman?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices are down and OPEC is turning
to outsiders for help. For Western nations this raises a question:
Is the cartel still a menace or only a harmless bogeyman?
   Less than a decade ago, oil-importing countries saw OPEC as the
devil, a dastardly outfit bent on carrying out economic terrorism
against the West.
   Some still do. But gradually the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries appears to be shedding its bad guy image.
   Evidence was the meeting this week between OPEC and seven
independent oil-producing nations to discuss joint cuts in oil
exports as a way of boosting prices.
   The outsiders are not part of the Western club of rich nations.
They include partly industrialized Mexico, Communist China, Marxist
Angola, two Arab countries and some relative newcomers to
oil-exporting status.
   Yet OPEC seems to have become more palatable even to some richer
countries.
   Norway over the past year has established close ties to the
cartel, and in 1987 the European Economic Community, comprised of
Britain, France, West Germany and nine other European nations, held
an initial ``seminar'' with OPEC representatives to exchange views.
   The seven non-OPEC countries did not come to Vienna because of a
new-found fondness for OPEC or a desire to become members. They
simply are so troubled by volatile oil prices that they will try
nearly anything to stabilize the market.
   Before the startling oil-price spirals of the 1970s began
unwinding six years ago, any formal deals between OPEC and other
oil producers would have seemed preposterous.
   For one thing, OPEC wasn't interested. As recently as 1978 it
controlled two-thirds of the non-Communist world's oil supplies.
Prices were high and most people thought they'd go much higher. Oil
at $100 a barrel seemed a good bet for the late 1980s.
   Then came the oil glut of the early 1980s. OPEC's fortunes took
a sharp turn as new oil-exporting powers such as Britain and Mexico
began undercutting OPEC prices and boosting their sales.
   Now the non-OPEC oil producers pump about 28 million barrels a
day while OPEC's output has dropped to 17.5 million barrels a day
from its 1978 peak of about 31 million barrels daily.
   OPEC has come to the conclusion that this trend must not
continue. So it has moderated its goals, saying it only wants to
keep oil prices at a ``reasonable'' level, and that all
oil-producing countries must help achieve this.
   ``OPEC is not against anybody,'' says Arturo Hernandez Grisanti,
the oil minister of Venezuela, which was one of five founding
members of the organization in 1960.
   ``OPEC is trying to stabilize the oil market, and this stability
is in the interests of everybody, including consumers,'' he told
reporters this week in Vienna.
   The message seems to be working. OPEC contacts with non-OPEC
countries, particularly in the Third World, are now commonplace.
   Although they had no direct role in this week's OPEC meetings,
the state of Texas and the Canadian province of Alberta sent
officials to Vienna to consult privately with key OPEC
representatives.
   Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission that
regulates the state's oil industry, says the United States has
nothing to fear from OPEC and should establish close ties to the
cartel.
   ``Right now OPEC is not in the position to do something that
would be harmful to us,'' he said in an interview.
   The Reagan administration refuses to deal openly with OPEC. It
maintains that governments should not interfere in the setting of
oil prices or production rates.
   This also is the official policy of the International Energy
Agency, a Paris-based body representing the United States and 20
other Western industrialized nations. The agency was set up after
the 1973 Arab oil embargo against the United States, an event that
propelled OPEC to instant status as an oil power.
   Part of OPEC's image problem is linked to the makeup of the
group. Some countries with close bilateral ties to the United
States, such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, say they honestly want
to avoid a repeat of the 1970s oil price shocks because it would
only mean another cycle of boom and bust in their countries.
   But other members, mainly Iran and Libya, have not abandoned the
aim of driving prices high quickly and getting the most out of a
resource the West can't do without.
   In recent years the Saudi view has prevailed. But in much of the
West, doubts persist about whether OPEC would stick to its moderate
pricing stance if the world supply glut ended and OPEC regained the
leverage to send prices skyrocketing.

<HEAD>European, Asian Officials Urge Reagan Veto of Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Asian and European Common Market officials are urging President
Reagan to veto the wide-ranging trade bill passed by Congress,
warning that the measure likely would invite retaliation harmful to
the world economy.
   The bill, which was passed Wednesday and is headed to Reagan for
his signature, toughens U.S. retaliatory measures against countries
engaged in unfair trade practices.
   It provoked street demonstrations by students in South Korea,
but drew a mild reaction in Hong Kong, where officials said the
British colony could adust to the measure.
   Some U.S. trading partners were encouraged because the bill
wasn't passed by sufficient votes to override a veto. But that did
not stop them from pressing their cases.
   ``Japan strongly fears that if the bill is enacted in its
present form, it will have a serious impact on bilateral and
multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of
the world economy,'' Japan's chief government spokesman Keizo
Obuchi said.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States totaled $50.9
billion last year.
   In Brussels, the European Economic Community's commissioner for
external trade, Willy de Clercq, said in a statement that the
trading bloc will use its rights under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, ``each time its interests are harmed by the
unilateral measures taken by the American authorities.''
   He made that threat contingent on whether Reagan successfully
vetoes the bill.
   South Korean Trade and Industry Minister Ahn Byong-wha said in
Seoul that the measure would invite retaliation, if it became law,
adding: ``We firmly believe the U.S. president will veto it as he
repeatedly confirmed.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim Hwang-kyung said the bill
contained protectionist provisions that ``might undermine an
orderly growth of international trade.''
   The bill ``will hamper not only the liberalization efforts of
the (South Korean) government, but also the smooth growing of the
Korea-U.S. economic and trade relationship,'' he added.
   The U.S. House of Representatives passed the trade legislation
April 21 and the Senate approved by a 63-36 vote, just under the
two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
   The legislation also imposes trade sanctions against Japan's
Toshiba Corp. for the sale by its subsidiary of sensitive equipment
to the Soviet Union.
   The sales violated rules of the Coordinating Committee for
Export Control, a Paris-based group that regulates Western
high-technology exports to communist nations.
   Hajime Tamura, who heads the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, said he regretted the Toshiba sanctions, but that MITI
appreciates ``the fact that more than one third of the total Senate
voted against the bill.''
   Joichi Aoi, president and chief executive officer of Toshiba,
which stands to lose more than $50 million this year if the bill
becomes law, also expressed strong disappointment.
   ``Toshiba Corporation was neither involved in, nor had any
knowledge of, the misconduct by Toshiba Machine Co., Ltd,'' Aoi
said in a statement. ``Thus, we have been insisting that it would
be grossly unfair to punish Toshiba Corporation.''
   In Brussels, a spokeswoman for De Clercq told reporters that the
EEC was ``waiting to see what happens next'' before making any
specific moves.
   The spokeswoman said that the EC objects to a number of
provisions in the trade bill which it considers to be protectionist
and to harm EEC interests.
   One would widen the power of the U.S. trade representative to
investigate and order retaliatory action against alleged unfair
trade practices. Another would threaten foreign companies' access
to the U.S. telecommunications market, if their governments do not
reduce barriers to entry by U.S. companies to their markets.
   Meanwhile, in South Korea, about 1,500 students from five
schools gathered at Seoul National University and hurled firebombs
at riot police in a protest denouncing the government and what they
called ``U.S. economic aggression.''
   This country posted a trade surplus of nearly $10 billion with
the United States last year.
   In Hong Kong, Director of Trade Michael Sze said the measure
``is a much better bill than the original one.''
   ``Many of the provisions which we were concerned about have
either been improved or dropped completely,'' he said, ``So from
Hong Kong's perspective I think it's a bill that we can live
with,'' Sze said in an interview with government-run Radio
Television Hong Kong.
   The United States accrued a $6.5 billion deficit in trade with
Hong Kong last year.

<TEXT>
   Wasserstein Perella & Co. and the Henley Group
Inc. announced Thursday they have combined for a $1.2 billion
acquisition of an IC Industries Inc. subsidiary that makes
aerospace, defense and auto products.
   The deal would be the first in which Wasserstein Perella, the
New York investment firm founded by two former First Boston Corp.
merger experts, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, commits its
own capital to a merger.
   Expected to close by the end of August, the transaction is a
leveraged buyout, in which the buyers use borrowed money and repay
it with the acquired company's asset sales or earnings.
   In this case the acquired business will be IC Industries'
Boston-based Pneumo Abex subsidiary, a manufacturer of aircraft
landing gear and flight controls, airport loading bridges and
brakes. IC would retain 49 percent of Pneumo Abex's defense systems
business, the companies said.
   Wasserstein Perella, equal partners in the arrangement, agreed
to put up $1.2 billion cash, most of it obtained through
subordinated debt and bank loans.
   The amount of money the companies will put directly into the
deal is in line with typical leveraged buyouts _ in the range of 10
percent to 15 percent _ said Henley spokesman Norman Ritter.
   Pneumo Abex had sales of $967 million last year.
   Wasserstein Perella, formed earlier this year, had so far
limited their participation in corporate takeovers to advising
clients.
   Henley intends to take a role in management, rather than treat
the deal as a passive investment, said Henley Chairman Michael
Dingman.
   La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley restructured last week to split
most of the company from its Wheelabrator Technologies Inc.
waste-to-energy subsidiary.
   Chicago-based IC, a consumer and commercial products, real
estate and transportation company, which is being restructured, put
Pneumo Abex on the market in October.

   The newspapers affected, all London-based, are the Daily Mirror

   Stocks fell Thursday after a bumpy ride that left
many investors nervous before an announcement of British trade data
for March.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share-index fell 2.3
points to 1,804.4 at the close.
   Dealers said there was some anxiety over the release Friday of
British trade data for last month, with many dealers expecting a
sharp widening in the trade shortfall.
   The market initially was buoyed by first-quarter results from
Imperial Chemical Industries, which showed that the chemical
giant's pretax profit rose sharply from a year earlier. The
company's performance is viewed as a barometer of British
industry's health.
   But by the end of London trading, ICI shares had fallen on
disappointment that the stock didn't rise more swiftly.
   At the close, the Financial Times 30-share index fell 4.2 points
to 1,444.7. The Financial Times 500-share index fell .66 points to
1,022.47.

<HEAD>First Quarter Earnings Down 80 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Corp. said Thursday that
earnings plunged by about 80 percent during 1988's first quarter
from a year earlier, partly because of seasonal losses tied to the
sale of its bus line.
   The company reported net income of $6.9 million or 17 cents per
share for the first quarter of 1988, down from $33.7 million or 86
cents per share last year.
   John W. Teets, chairman and chief executive officer, said there
was a seasonal loss of $5.9 million or 16 cents per share from
Greyhound's 22.5 percent equity in GLI Holding Co., a Texas company
that bought Greyhound Lines in March 1987 for $350 million.
   Greyhound is a diversified company that produces items ranging
from food to laundry soap.
   First-quarter revenues totaled $701 million, up from $493
million a year earlier.
   Income in continuing operations rose 44 percent to $12.8 millin
or 33 cents per share in the first quarter compared to $8.9 million
or 22 cents per share in 1987, Greyhound said.
   ``Results of comparable operations were well ahead of last year
and almost all of our major businesses were on or ahead of plan,''
Teets said. ``Most of our operating companies showed substantial
improvements in profitability in the first quarter.''
   Teets said the revenue increase resulted primarily from the
Dobbs Airline and Airport Services acquisition in November 1987 and
the purchase of General Motors' transit bus and repair parts
business last May.

<HEAD>Pennzoil To Move Slowly In Investing $3 Billion; Quarterly
Earnings Higher</HEAD>

   Pennzoil Co. plans to move slowly and cautiously
in finding ways to invest $3 billion it received from Texaco Inc.,
Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke told shareholders Thursday at the
company's annual meeting.
   ``The short of it is, we haven't fully decided on the right
course,'' Liedtke said. ``It would avail our shareholders and our
employees little to have won this settlement only to lose a portion
of its value through hasty or ill-considered actions.''
   Liedtke, who is giving up his position as Pennzoil's chief
executive officer but remaining as chairman, said the board would
be considering a number of investments in coming months.
   During a news conference following the shareholders meeting,
neither Liedtke nor Pennzoil President Randal B. McDonald would
offer many specifics other than to say the company would strive
toward a balance between acquisitions of oil and gas reserves, and
a balance between exploration and production activities and
refining and marketing activities.
   Liedtke said top company officials had a list of 25-30 companies
under consideration for investment, of which about six have been
examined in detail.
   Publicity about the huge payment to Pennzoil had brought with it
a deluge of suggestions of how the money should be spent, Liedtke
said.
   ``They range all over the place,'' he said. ``One man in
Liverpool wants to take his wife to Paris.''
   After the meeting, the company announced that its first-quarter
earnings jumped 71 percent, bolstered by higher refinery margins
and a one-time gain from the early redemption of a bond issue.
   Pennzoil said it earned $20.7 million, or 41 cents per share,
compared with $12.1 million, or 20 cents per share, in the same
period a year ago.
   During the first quarter, the company experienced an after-tax
gain of $6.9 million, or 17 cents per share, through an early
debenture redemption.
   Revenues totaled $485 million, compared with $445 million for
the same period in 1987, the company said.
   Higher prices for natural gas and larger sales volumes bolstered
a gain in Pennzoil's oil and gas segment to $27 million from $17.5
million in the 1987 first quarter, it said.
   Operating income from the company's products division fell to
$28.4 million from $33 million during the same period in 1987,
mostly due to lower sales volumes and margins on its motor oil,
Pennzoil said.
   First quarter operating income from the company's sulphur
division was $11.9 million, down from $16.5 million during the
first three months of 1987, the company said.
   Liedtke, who has been Pennzoil's chief executive officer for 35
years, received a standing ovation following his address to
shareholders. Afterward, he told reporters he planned to spend more
time with his family, as well as reading and travelling, in the
years ahead.

<HEAD>Ford Sets World Industry Record for Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co.'s first-quarter earnings set a
world auto industry record for a single quarter, and industry
analysts predicted Thursday that Ford will top competitors in
profitability throughout 1988.
   The nation's second-largest automaker said Thursday it earned
$1.623 billion, or $3.31 a share, on sales of $20.74 billion in the
first three months of 1988.
   Ford's first-quarter earnings were up 8.8 percent from $1.49
billion, or $2.87 a share earned in the first quarter of 1987 on
sales of $18.14 billion.
   The previous quarterly earnings record was set by General Motors
Corp., the world's largest automaker, with $1.614 billion in
profits in first-quarter 1984.
   In the first quarter of this year, GM earned $1.09 billion, or
$3.11 a share, on sales of $26.44 billion. Chrysler Corp., the No.
3 U.S. automaker, earned $183.7 million, or 83 cents a share, on
sales of $7.8 billion.
   Ford said a 10.2 percent drop in U.S. earnings from a year ago,
caused by costs of buyer incentive campaigns and new-product
launches, was offset by a nearly 76 percent jump in overseas
earnings.
   Ford earned $1.04 billion in the United States in the first
quarter, down from $1.16 billion a year ago. Outside the United
States, Ford earned $580 million, up from $330 million in
first-quarter 1987, Ford said.
   ``Our first-quarter earnings reflect the good balance of the
overall Ford team effort,'' the company said in a statement
attributed to Chairman Donald E. Petersen and Vice Chairman Harold
A. Poling.
   ``With increasingly competitive worldwide automotive markets,
Ford must continue to improve quality and operating efficiency, as
well as offer customers good value in products,'' they said.
   In 1987, Ford set a world industry earnings record for a single
year with a profit of $4.63 billion. Ford also was the top-earning
U.S. automaker in 1986, earning $3.29 billion and outperforming GM
for the first time since the 1920s.
   Ford also continues to sit on a $10 billion cash reserve. The
company is seeking a major acquisition that, while outside the auto
industry itself, might complement Ford's main business.
   David McCammon, Ford treasurer and vice president for finance,
said the company is searching patiently and carefully for either
one main acquisition or a coordinated series of smaller purchases,
but gave no further details.
   McCammon declined to project Ford earnings for the rest of 1988
but said he believes industrywide U.S. sales of imported and
domestic vehicles may top current predictions of about 15 million.
   Ford said the incentives and new-product launches, while costly,
helped boost sales and increase Ford's share of the U.S. car market
1.8 percentage points to 21.8 percent in the first quarter.
   Ford's share of the U.S. truck market grew slightly from
first-quarter 1987 to 29.7 percent. Strong sales left Ford with
lower-than-average inventories of unsold vehicles, the company said.
   Industry analysts predicted Ford would continue to lead the
industry in earnings throughout 1988, partly because it has boosted
production schedules for the second half of the year.
   ``Ford's gross profit per unit and manufacturing profit per unit
are far and away better than General Motors,'' said Joe Phillippi,
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
   Phillippi said Ford's sales include a healthy percentage of
high-profit vehicles while it has the best control over costs in
the industry.
   Ford said its Financial Services Group earnings were below those
of a year ago because of lower profits at First Nationwide.
However, Ford Credit earned a record $200 million in the quarter,
up 2 percent from a year ago.
   Its foreign performance was boosted in Europe by strong sales
throughout the industry, improved profit margins and favorable
exchange rates contributed $60 million toward offsetting the $100
million cost of a two-week strike at a British plant, McCammon said.
   In Latin America, the Autolatina joint venture Ford and
Volkswagen formed in July 1987 helped earnings by reducing
operating costs and cutting interest expenses and benefited from
improvements in the Brazilian economy.

<HEAD>Prime Reports First Quarter Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATICK, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. on Thursday reported a
64 percent first quarter revenue increase to $363.7 million,
including the operations of Computervision Inc. from the merger of
the two companies in February.
   The company reported net income of $14.5 million for the quarter
ending April 4, a 22 percent increase over $11.9 million for the
same period last year. Revenues increased from $221.7 million in
the first quarter of 1987.
   Per share earnings for the period were 30 cents, compared with
24 cents for the same period last year.
   The 1987 figures do not include Computervision's results from
that quarter. Prime also said its first quarter net income figure
excludes an operating loss incurred by Computervision from Jan. 1
to Feb. 5.
   Prime's $435 million purchase of outstanding Computervision
shares made the new company second only to International Business
Machines Corp. in computer-aided design and manufacturing.
   In a statement, Prime president Joe M. Henson attributed the
earnings increase to strong demand for the company's new 4000
Series mid-range systems and Computervision's CADDS product line.
   Prime reported profits of $64.8 million last year, a 38 percent
increase over 1986, on revenues of $960.9 million.

   A tentative agreement including a
base-pay raise of 50 cents an hour and a one-time signing bonus of
$1,000 was announced Thursday for 5,400 members of United
Steelworkers of America at 11 Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Co. plants
nationwide.
   The contract, subject to employee ratification, would be
retroactive to April 4 and run through Oct. 31, 1990, a joint
union-management statement said.
   Details of the agreement were to be covered in meetings and
letters from the union leadership to employees. Voting is expected
to be completed in about three weeks.
   The pact covers plants in Gramercy, Chalmette and Norco in
Louisiana; Mead, Trentwood and Tacoma in Washington; Ravenswood, W.
Va.; Newark, Toledo and Tacoma in Ohio, and Purvis, Miss.
   In a joint statement, Kaiser vice president for industrial
relations James O. Presley, and USWA negotiating committee chairman
Jim Bowen, said the differences between the sides were solved and
left intact the company's ability to compete.

   The stock market declined slightly today, faced
with rising interest rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds showed losses of about $5
for each $1,000 in face value today, putting their yields in the
neighborhood of 9.05 to 9.10 percent.
   Analysts said the latest data on unemployment claims prompted
expectations that employment statistics for April will show
continued strength in the economy.
   That, in turn, would be viewed by some Wall Streeters as an
added bit of impetus for the Federal Reserve to consider tightening
credit against the possibility of increasing inflationary pressures.
   Brokers noted that the volume of stock trading remained light,
suggesting that the market was still suffering more from caution
than from any widespread selling.

   Assets of the nation's 425 money market mutual
funds tumbled $1.62 billion in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline to $272.84 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $312 million drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The previous week's decline had initially been reported as
$850.6 million.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 212 general purpose funds fell $748.2 million to $82.6
billion and assets of 97 broker-dealer funds fell $1.26 billion to
$116.29 billion.
   But the trade group said assets of 116 institutional funds rose
$382.5 million to $73.95 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.14 percent from 6.09 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
42 days, up from 41 days the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts slipped
to 5.67 percent as of Wednesday from 5.68 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.14 percent from 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.85
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 7.17 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
7.59 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and 8.05 percent on 5-year
CDs, up from 8.04 percent.

<HEAD>Allegis Profits In 1st Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegis Corp. reported strong first quarter
earnings Thursday, attributing the performance to its sale of
Westin Hotels & Resorts and increased traffic aboard the United
Airlines subsidiary.
   Allegis reported net income of nearly $576.9 million, or $12.02
a share, for the first three months of 1988, compared with a net
loss of more than $30.5 million, or 60 cents a share, for the same
period a year ago.
   Revenues for the quarter totaled more than $2.1 billion compared
with nearly $1.9 billion a year earlier. Sales of United passenger
tickets accounted for more than $1.7 billion of revenues in the
most recent quarter.
   The results included a gain of $548.5 million from the Jan. 31
sale of the Westin hotel chain to Caeser Park Hotel Investment
Inc., a unit of Aoki Corp. of Japan and the Robert M. Bass Group of
Fort Worth, Texas.
   Excluding the sale of Westin, which Allegis counted as a
discontinued operation, the company's earnings from continuing
operations totaled $27.9 million. That compares with a loss of
$54.5 million from continuing operations, predominantly United, for
first quarter last year.
   ``We are encouraged by our results for the first quarter,'' said
Allegis Chairman Stephen M. Wolf. ``Our favorable performance was
driven primarily by strong revenue as both both traffic and yield
were up over the previous year.''

   Eastern Airlines announced 60th-birthday fare cuts
Thursday that executives hope will restore a ridership that has
lagged since federal inspectors launched a safety check of the
troubled carrier's planes.
   ``We have been dented in terms of bookings'' since the Federal
Aviation Administration earlier this month started inspecting
Eastern's 267 planes, said John Nelson, vice president of marketing
for the Miami-based carrier.
   ``You know we're not going to talk about specifics. We took some
bumps,'' said Nelson. ``And this (fare cuts) in part is due to this.
   ``There will be some who won't come back,'' he said, estimating
that Eastern flies 100,000 passengers daily and hopes to increase
that.
   The carrier has been deeply hurt by large losses and persistent
labor hostility, compounded by recurring questions about its safety
practices.
   Before uncorking champagne and cutting a cake topped with a huge
``60'' candle in honor of the carrier's May 1 birthday, Nelson said
Eastern's MaxSaver fares between May 1 and June 15 will be rolled
back to prices set when the fare was created in February 1987.
   Under the reductions, a Miami-New York flight with a current
lowest price of $104 would cost $79 one way. A $119 one-way
Miami-Boston fare will cost $89.
   Other pricing gimmicks are first-class seats for $60 roundtrip
over the cost of domestic MaxSaver fares; letting people born on
May 1 fly free if accompanied by a passenger paying a MaxSaver
fare; allowing MaxSaver fare flyers to bring a companion for $60
more each way, on most flights; and offering a ``very frequent
flyer'' program.
   Under that program, people who take 60 Eastern flights
(excluding its shuttle) between May 1 and June 30 will receive
unlimited travel for a year, or can treat 30 friends to a free
domestic Eastern flight.
   ``It's a relatively slow travel period. We're awaiting the
summer rush. We're trying to get people out of their cars, out of
their homes,'' Nelson said.
   ``The direction we're taking is contrary'' to the airline
industry, he added. ``How other carriers are going to react I don't
know.''
   Continental Airlines, which like Eastern is owned by Texas Air
Corp., will generally not match the fares, said spokesman Ned
Walker.
   ``We are only going to match in certain selective markets where
we are competitive with Eastern. For the most part we will not be
matching their fare action,'' Walker said. ``We currently have a
good pricing structure and don't see a need to change it.''
   Eastern was born in 1928 as Pitcairn Aviation, ferrying mail at
night under a contract with the federal government. On hand at the
news conference-birthday celebration Thursday was Gene Brown, who
flew Pitcairn's inaugural flight on May 1, 1928.

   The dollar fell against all major currencies
except the Canadian dollar Thursday in light, end-of-the-month
activity.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$450 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared with $450.80 late
Wednesday.
   Traders said the dollar continued to move in a very narrow
range. ``There's really nothing going on,'' said David Godwin,
chief foreign exchange dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland.
   Most of the day's activity centered on the British pound, which
traders sold ahead of the British government's release of its
monthly trade report on Friday.
   ``Fear that the numbers would be bad prompted some selling of
sterling,'' said Curtis Perkins, a trader at Chemical New York
Capital Markets Group. He noted that sterling was the only currency
to move out of its trading range.
   Dealers said there was little positioning going on ahead of the
Commerce Department's release on Friday of its index of leading
economic indicators for March.
   The dollar finished mostly lower in Europe, where trading also
was quiet. Dealers there were reconciling their positions at the
end of the month.
   ``It's more position-squaring than anything else,'' said a
trader at a major German bank in Frankfurt. ``People don't feel
like keeping a high profile around the end of the month.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.17 yen to a closing 124.82 yen. Later in
London, it was slightly lower at 124.65 yen. In New York the dollar
closed at 124.515 yen, down from 124.865 yen on Wednesday.
   In London it cost $1.8755 to buy one pound late in the day,
slightly more expensive for buyers than Wednesday's $1.8750. In New
York it cost $1.87385 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.8735
on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.6694 West German marks, down from 1.67475;
1.38425 Swiss francs, down from 1.3870; 5.6710 French francs, down
from 5.6915; 1,242.375 Italian lire, down from 1,245.50, and 1.2302
Canadian dollars, up from 1.22835.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.6705 West German marks, down from 1.6785; 1.3832 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3905; 5.6685 French francs, down from 5.69625;
1.8715 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8810; 1,240.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,246.82; 1.2296 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2278.
   Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold
closed at $450.60 a troy ounce, down from $452.80 on Wednesday.
   In London, gold sold for a late bid price of $451 a troy ounce,
down from late Wednesday's bid of $452. In Zurich, the bid price in
listless trading was $452, up from $451.50 late Wednesday. Earlier
in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.57 to close at a bid $453.54.
   Silver closed at $6.466 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, down
from $6.498 on Wednesday. In London the metal finished at a bid
price of $6.50 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's late bid of $6.49.

   Stock prices sagged Thursday in the slowest
session of the year on Wall Street.
   Analysts said a rise in interest rates put an added damper on an
already wary and listless market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 6.63 to
2,041.28, ending a run of five consecutive gains that added up to
62.50 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in the
daily tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 621 up,
850 down and 483 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 128.68 million shares, down from 133.81
million Wednesday and the lightest total since 111.58 million were
traded last Dec. 29. The NYSE's composite index lost .61 to 148.33.
   Prices of long-term government bonds showed losses of about $5
for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the
neighborhood of 9.05 to 9.10 percent.
   Analysts said the latest data on unemployment claims prompted
expectations that employment statistics for April will show
continued strength in the economy.
   That, in turn, would be viewed by some Wall Streeters as an
added bit of impetus for the Federal Reserve to consider tightening
credit against the possibility of increasing inflationary pressures.
   Brokers noted that the slow pace of activity suggested that the
market was still suffering more from caution than from any
wholesale selling.
   But that was small consolation to traders who have watched
stocks make little progress over the past several weeks, except for
pockets of takeover activity and brief, sharp swings attributed to
computer program-driven trading.
   The best gainer on Thursday's active list was Lucky Stores, up
5] at 61{ on volume of more than 3.3 million shares. The company,
which has been resisting the takeover advances of American Stores,
said it agreed to a $61-a-share buyout by a New York investment
firm.
   Ford Motor, which reported higher first-quarter earnings, eked
out a [-point gain to 47|.

<HEAD>Posts Wider Loss Due to Higher Interest Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., the publishing,
insurance and theme park concern, said Thursday its loss widened in
the first quarter when its interest costs soared sixfold.
   But the company's operating loss narrowed from a year ago, and
officials noted that the first quarter often is weak because of the
seasonality of the educational publishing and amusement park
businesses.
   The higher interest expenses resulted from heavy borrowing last
year as the company financed a recapitalization to thwart a hostile
takeover effort.
   Harcourt, based in Orlando, Fla., said it lost $35.5 million in
the three months ended March 31 in contrast to a loss of $9.4
million in the same quarter last year.
   Its revenue for the quarter rose 7.4 percent to $306.7 million
from $285.7 million a year earlier.
   The company said its operating loss before the recapitalization
charges narrowed to $13.5 million from $47.3 million a year earlier.
   ``We are pleased with the results because have been able to
reduce our first quarter operating loss by about 70 percent from
last year,'' said John F. Berardi, Harcourt's vice president and
treasurer.
   Harcourt's interest expense climbed six-fold to $67.2 million
from $11.2 million a year earlier.
   It said revenue from its publishing operations rose 2 percent to
$128.5 million for the quarter, but its loss from publishing
operations narrowed to $26.6 million from $39.2 million.
   The company is a leading publisher of school textbooks, and the
first quarter is normally weak because of ordering patterns in that
business.
   Revenue from theme parks, including the Sea World parks in
Florida, California and Ohio, rose 26.8 percent to $61.0 million,
while income from park operations fell 7.2 percent to $4.0 million.
   Insurance revenue rose 4.5 percent to $117.1 million and the
company reported income of $10.9 million from insurance operations
in contrast to a loss of $6.6 million a year earlier that included
a pretax charge of $15.2 million for the relocation of the
company's insurance operations to Florida from Michigan.
   The latest results also included a $3.2 million gain on the sale
of land.

<TEXT>
   After declining sharply in 1986 mostly due to
falling world oil prices, Mexico's troubled economy grew modestly
last year but its chronic inflation also rose, the nation's central
bank reported Thursday.
   In its annual report, the Bank of Mexico said the gross national
product grew by 1.4 percent in 1987, after contracting by 4 percent
the previous year. Industrial production during 1987 rose by 2.9
percent. Among the best performing components, mining rose 6.9
percent, electrical production 6.1 percent, manufacture 2.1 percent
and contruction 2.2 percent.
   Services during the year rose 1.2 percent, but agriculture
dropped by 0.3 percent.
   According to the report, Mexico's balance of payments similarly
improved from a deficit of $1.7 billion in 1986 to a surplus of
$3.9 billion last year as a result of a substantial improvement in
the terms of the country's trade structure.
   Income from non-petroleum exports during that period rose by an
unprecedented 24 percent as a result of a new overall drive to sell
more abroad, and income from petroleum exports rose 37 percent,
while imports dropped by 7 percent and foreign debt service
payments by 2 percent.
   At $105 billion, Mexico's is the biggest foreign debt among
developing nations after Brazil.
   Direct foreign investments in 1987 totaled $3.2 billion, and the
country showed a net foreign currency income of $1.199 billion,
while foreign currency reserves rose by $6.9 billion to $13.7
billion by the end of 1987.
   Treasury Secretary Gustavo Petricioli said last week Mexico's
foreign currency reserves currently stand at an all-time high of
more than $16 billion.
   But the annual rate of inflation _ as measured by the consumer
price index _ soared from 105.7 percent in 1986 to 159.2 percent
last year, the report said, sharply reducing the purchasing power
of salaries, which have not kept pace.
   The government put into effect an Economic Solidarity Pact in
December, intended to reduce monthly inflation to 1 to 2 percent by
the end of 1988. De la Madrid said recently that the target of 2
percent monthly inflation should be reached by midyear.

<HEAD>All Three Money Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three of the Federal Reserve Board's
measures of the nation's money supply rose in mid-April, the
central bank said Thursday.
   The Fed said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$300 million in the week ended April 18 to a seasonally adjusted
$766.6 billion from $766.3 billion the previous week.
   It said the measure known as M2 rose $600 million to a
seasonally adjusted $2,991.5 billion from $2,990.9 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $1.3 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,760.1 billion from $3,758.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   Some economists say changes in the money supply provide clues
about trends in inflation. But the Federal Reserve has appeared to
place less emphasis on money supply growth in recent years than it
did earlier this decade.
   In setting its monetary policy, the Fed says it monitors the
value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between
short- and long-term interest rates as well as changes in M2 and M3.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $234 million in
the week ended April 20, compared with a decline of $1.36 billion a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $300 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, down from $515 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $276.3 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $274.1 billion two weeks earlier.

<TEXT>
   Lucky Stores Inc., spurning a takeover by
rival American Stores Inc. that would have created the nation's
largest supermarket chain, agreed Thursday to a $2.2 billion merger
with a New York investment firm.
   The announcement sent Lucky's stock climbing $5.375 to close at
$61.50 on the New York Stock Exchange _ nearly twice its value a
month ago when American Stores made its offer. More than 3.3
million Lucky shares were bought and sold, making it one of the
most actively traded issues.
   The $61-per-share deal is worth about $600 million more than the
initial $45-per-share offer by American Stores. The Salt Lake
City-based suitor sweetened the offer to $60 earlier Thursday but
was again rebuffed.
   An analyst said Lucky's consent to be acquired by the investment
firm of Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen is unlikely to end the
bidding war for California's second-largest grocery chain.
   Under the agreement, a company formed by Gibbons, Green, van
Amerongen will launch a cash tender offer next Wednesday to acquire
35.7 million shares of Lucky shares _ 92 percent of the shares
outstanding _ for $61 per share.
   Following completion of the tender offer, the two companies will
merge and the remaining stockholders will receive preferred stock
with a stated value of up to $7 for each of their shares, according
to a joint announcement by both companies.
   Lucky stock climbed $5 a share to $61.125 in heavy trading on
the New York Stock Exchange midway through the session.
   Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen said it would retain current Lucky
management and employees and maintain its corporate headquarters in
Dublin, 25 miles east of San Francisco.
   ``We believe it (Lucky) is the pre-eminent supermarket company
in the areas of its operations,'' said Leonard Green, a partner in
Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen.
   The investment firm said it had received a ``highly confident''
letter from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on the probability of
financing. Based upon proposals from commercial banks, Gibbons,
Green said it expects bank financing to be committed shortly.
   Lucky's board of directors said it decided to accept the offer
over American Stores' bid based on the opinion of Goldman Sachs &
Co., financial advisers to the company.
   John M. Lillie, chairman and chief executive officer, said, ``We
believe that the the transaction ... is very beneficial to our
stockholders and allows Lucky to continue with its plans for
growth.''
   The offer is subject to financing, a majority of Lucky shares
being tendered and other conditions.
   Analyst Jeff Siegel of Pershing & Co. in New York said the deal
would allow Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen to gain a valuable
foothold in Southern California. But he said American Stores could
remain in the bidding.
   He said Lucky's retail base and strong management make it a
worthwhile target.
   Another San Francisco Bay area grocery giant, Oakland-based
Safeway Stores Inc., took a similar action and went private in an
acquisition by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in 1986.
   The offer from American Stores in late March came just 17 months
after Lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt by New York
investor Asher Edelman.
   A merger of American Stores and Lucky would create the nation's
largest supermarket chain, surpassing Kroger Co.
   American Stores, a grocery and drugstore chain, has 1,700
outlets in 40 states.
   Lucky employs 39,000 people and has 480 outlets. With 340 stores
in California, it is smaller only than Safeway in the state.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices tumbled Thursday on indications that an
expected cut in export quotas would not cause a tightening of
available supplies of unroasted beans, analysts said.
   On other markets, prices for future delivery of oil, precious
metals, livestock, meat, grains, soybeans and stock-index futures
all retreated.
   Coffee traders on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange had
been worried that falling prices would trigger an automatic
reduction in export quotas under the International Coffee
Organization's price-support system.
   But the ICO announced Thursday that shipments from October
through March were at their lowest level in six years, indicating
some producer countries had held back coffee and undershipped their
export quotas for the six-month period, said Sandra Kaul, an
analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Under ICO rules, those countries will be required to make up the
2-million-bag difference during the second half of the ICO
marketing year, ``so supplies are going to be even larger than
people had been anticipating,'' Ms. Kaul said.
   ``Now people are no longer afraid that a quota cut would make
supplies too tight,'' she said. ``Even with a quota cut, supplies
are going to be pretty plentiful this quarter.''
   With the new supply outlook, U.S. roasters curtailed their
buying of coffee futures and prices fell rapidly, she said. The
active contract, for delivery in July, tumbled 1.48 cents, settling
at $1.328 a pound.
   Crude oil futures drifted lower throughout the day on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, then dropped below $18 a barrel near the
close as the market registered doubt that OPEC members would agree
to reduce their crude oil exports.
   Representatives of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries began meeting Thursday afternoon in Vienna, Austria, on a
proposal to cut their exports by 5 percent in an attempt to boost
prices.
   Six independent oil-producing nations have agreed to reduce
their exports by 5 percent if OPEC will do likewise.
   ``The market has decided it's going to be disappointed
regardless of what happens at the OPEC meetings,'' said Bob Baker,
an analyst in New York for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 29 cents
lower with June at $17.98 a barrel; heating oil was .69 cent to .80
cent lower with May at 50.97 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.53 cent to .85 cent lower with May at 51.83 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures retreated on the Commodity Exchange in
New York in reaction to the slide in oil futures, analysts said.
   Gold settled $1.70 lower across the board with June at $452.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 3.4 cents lower with May at
$6.466 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures prices sank on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
a delayed reaction to last week's government reports showing
larger-than-expected numbers of cattle being fattened for slaughter.
   Cattle futures had risen the previous two days on strong cash
markets but ``I think the reality of the report is taking hold,''
said Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington
Heights, Ill. ``It shows a lot more cattle to be marketed in May
and June.''
   Heavy movement of hogs to market pressured hog and pork-belly
futures, he said.
   Live cattle settled .67 cent lower to .45 cent higher with June
at 70.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent
lower with April at 80.65 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .50
cent lower with June at 48.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .32 cent to 1.20 cents lower with May at 51.47 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade as the outlook for crop planting and winter wheat
harvesting improved.
   Six-to-10 day forecasts by the National Weather Service and
private forecasters called for dry weather for planting of corn and
soybeans in the Corn Belt early next week followed by rain, which
will benefit crops already planted, especially oats and spring
wheat, analysts said.
   The weather forecasts also were favorable for the winter wheat
harvest, which is under way in Texas, said Walter Spilka, an
analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 4 cents lower with May at $3.06{ a
bushel; corn was { cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $2.00\ a
bushel; oats were 3\ cents to 6 cents lower with May at $1.61 a
bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to \ cent higher with May at
$6.75} a bushel.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .60 point lower at 263.40.

<HEAD>Scottish Bank To Acquire Citizens Group for $440 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citizens Financial Group Inc. said
Thursday it has agreed to be acquired for $440 million by the Royal
Bank of Scotland, the sixth-largest banking group in the United
Kingdom.
   The acquisition will make Rhode Island the home of Royal Bank's
U.S. operations and will ``serve as the flagship for future
expansion in the Northeast,'' Citizens said in a statement.
   Under terms of a definitive agreement, Citizen's shareholders
will receive $30.50 a share in cash. Royal Bank also has an option
to purchase additional shares for $25.50 each.
   Citizens, which runs Citizens Savings Bank and Citizens Trust
Co., is the third-largest Rhode Island-based banking company, with
assets of $2.6 billion. Royal Bank, the largest bank in Scotland,
has assets totaling $36 billion.
   George Graboys, Citizens president and chief executive officer,
said the bank's name and employees will remain, but fresh capital
will be provided to compete in the region's concentrated banking
market. He did not elaborate.
   ``Royal Bank has indicated its support of our growth strategies
and long-range plan for banking and non-banking activities. Their
resources, wide range of products and services and international
expertise will complement ours,'' Graboys said.
   Graboys said he met with Charles M. Winter, Royal Bank Group
chief executive, onThursday morning to finalize the deal.
   Winter noted in a statement that Citizens has no outstanding
loans to less developed countries and no energy loans. He said
Citizens will ``provide Royal Bank Group with a platform for
controlled expansion in a prosperous and economically diversified
area'' of the United States.
   Citizens, which is scheduled to hold its annual meeting
Wednesday, will call a special meeting for shareholders to vote on
the acquisition this summer.
   In addition to shareholder approval, the acquisition requires
the approval of federal and state regulators in America and the
United Kingdom, which Citizens officials said could take up to
eight months.
   Citizens also announced the Federal Reserve Board has approved
its conversion to a state-chartered facility from a federally
chartered institution. The move, which would have been sought in
any event, should facilitate the acquisition, Graboys said.
   Citizens operates 30 branches in Rhode Island and maintains loan
production offices in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine.
Citizens also owns Gulf States Mortgage Co., which is based in
Georgia.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Reports Earnings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s first-quarter
earnings rose 19 percent compared with the year-ago period partly
because of increased revenues in the transport aircraft operation,
the company said Thursday.
   McDonnell Douglas earned $51.2 million, or $1.33 per share, on
revenues of $3.24 billion in the first quarter. Earnings in the
same quarter last year were $43 million, or $1.06 per share, on
revenues of $3.03 billion, the company said.
   Transport aircraft revenues increased sharply because the
company delivered 24 MD-80 aircraft in the first quarter of this
year, compared with earlier rates of 12 planes a year. Combat
aircraft earnings also increased, but the increase was more than
offset by the impact of an early retirement program instituted in
1987, the company said.
   The voluntary early retirement program resulted in a one-time,
pre-tax charge of $66 million, or 93 cents a share.
   The company said it has invested heavily to deveop the MD-11
tri-jet and to compete for the Air Force's advanced tactical
fighter program.
   Chairman John F. McDonnell, who reported the earnings at the
company's annual shareholders meeting, said McDonnell Douglas is
considering a cooperative agreement with the European aircraft
manufacturer Airbus Industries to develop a family of aircraft that
could compete successfully with Boeing Co., the current leader in
the commercial aircraft industry.
   He described negotiations with Airbus as very preliminary,
complicated and delicate, adding that there was ``absolutely no
assurance that we will come to an agreement any time soon.''

   The Quaker Oats Co. is misleading the public
by exaggerating the health benefits of eating oat cereal, a
consumer group said Thursday in a complaint to the Federal Trade
Commission.
   A spokesman for the Chicago-based company said the complaint is
without merit and that the claims have scientific backing.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit
advocacy group, accused Quaker of running magazine advertisements
that overstate the contribution of Quaker Oats and Oat Bran in
reducing the risk of heart disease.
   The ads, featuring actor Wilford Brimley, recommend lowering fat
intake and adding complex carbohydrates and fiber to the diet.
   But the center objected to part of the ads saying clinical
studies showed serum-cholesterol levels dropped an average of
nearly 10 percent among people who ate Quaker Oats daily as part of
a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.
   ``The Brimley ads make the reader believe that Quaker Oats are
some type of magic wand,'' said Bruce Silverglade, the center's
legal director. ``In fact, most of the improvement in the health of
individuals who eat Quaker Oats was due to also eating a low-fat,
low-cholesterol diet.''
   He said oat cereal, by itself, accounted for only a 3 percent
chloresterol reduction and a corresponding decline of 6 percent in
the risk of heart disease, ``a modest to minimal improvement ... of
borderline significance.''
   ``Any health-related claim made in food advertising needs to be
supported by reliable scientific evidence,'' said Ron Bottrell,
Quaker's manager of corporate communications. ``In this case, we
feel that we have it.''
   A heart-disease specialist at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in Bethesda, Md., said he had not seen the ads and did
not want to take sides.
   ``Nobody would get too excited if you reduced the risk by that
amount,'' Dr. Basil Rifkind said. ``On the other hand, if you look
at it in population terms, we usually say that even small
reductions in chloresterol could be meaningful.''
   The center asked the FTC to order Quaker to discontinue the ads
and replace them with ones that would ``correct any misimpressions
that consumers have derived from the original advertising
campaign.''
   ``We don't think we misled the reader in any way,'' Bottrell
said, adding the study Quaker cited was the most conservative among
several supporting its claims.
   ``The claim we're making in the ad clearly talks about eating
oats as part of a reduced-fat, reduced-chloresterol diet,'' he
said. ``We're not ascribing the overall benefit to oats alone.''
   FTC spokeswoman Dee Ellison said the commission had no immediate
comment on the complaint and would not speculate on if or when it
would take action.
   ``We take letters of this type quite seriously,'' she said. ``So
there is no particular time limit for reaching a resolution.''

   Johnson & Johnson on Thursday
reported an 18.7 percent increase in its first quarter profit over
a year ago on strong sales.
   The health care and consumer products giant said it netted $279
million, or $1.62 a share in the first three months of this year,
compared with earnings of $235 million, or $1.36 a share, in the
1987 period.
   Sales jumped 16.7 percent, to $2.31 billion from $1.98 billion.
   Johnson & Johnson Chairman James E. Burke said favorable
currency exchange rates helped improve its quarterly sales.
   ``The lower value of the dollar in the period, compared with a
year earlier, added $96 million to the first three months' sales,''
the company said in a statement.
   International sales increased 27.8 percent, to $1.14 billion
from $892 million last year.
   Domestic sales rose 7.5 percent, to $1.17 billion from $1.08
billion.

   Enron Corp., the nation's largest natural gas
transmission company, said Thursday it was considering the sale of
its oil and gas subsidiary, one of the biggest U.S. independent oil
and gas concerns.
   ``Based upon prices paid in recent transactions for oil and gas
reserves, the sale of all or part of EOG (Enron Oil & Gas Co.)
would strengthen substantially Enron's financial position and
provide the flexibility to pursue very attractive opportunities we
see in the energy business,'' said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman.
   Enron Oil & Gas had reserves of 1.42 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas and 42.3 million barrels of oil as of the end of 1987.
   For the entire year, it sold an average of 343 million cubic
feet of natural gas and 12,000 barrels of oil per day.
   For the first three months of 1988, that rate has risen to 399
million cubic feet of gas and 13,000 barrels of oil, the company
said.
   ``Assuming completion of a sale, we will be realizing for our
shareholders the tremendous value inherent in these assets under
current favorable market conditions,'' Lay said.
   He said proceeds from a sale would be used to reduce Enron's
indebtedness and interest expense and enhance near-term earnings
and future cash flow.
   Lay, speaking at Enron's annual meeting Thursday, said debt
reduction was a major goal for 1988. Debt as a percentage of
capitalization stood at 75.6 at the end of 1987 and was reduced to
67 percent by the end of the first quarter.
   Enron earlier Thursday reported first-quarter earnings of $69.4
million, or $1.20 per share, compared with $62.7 million, or $1.06
per share, for the year-earlier period.
   ``Among the primary causes was a return to more normal winter
temperature patterns than the relatively warm heating seasons of
the last three years,'' Lay said. ``The colder weather, resulting
in increased natural gas use, was coupled with higher average
prices for gas, which also proved beneficial to earnings.''
   In releasing the financial figures, the company restated
earnings for 1987 to reflect adoption of changed accounting rules,
reducing 1987's reported first quarter earnings by $3.9 million,
reflecting a lower federal income tax benefit due to a tax rate
change relative to depreciation and amortization expenses.

<HEAD>Utility Requests More Time For Reorganization; Suggests Fed
Regulation</HEAD>

   Public Service Company of New Hampshire
asked a federal bankruptcy judge Thursday for an eight-month
extension to file its reorganization plan, although the judge has
indicated he wasn't inclined to grant one.
   Public Service also outlined four reorganization options it was
considering, including formation of a federally-regulated holding
company so it could start charging ratepayers for its 36 percent
share of the stalled, $5.3 billion Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   Bankruptcy law gives a debtor the exclusive right to propose a
reorganization plan for 120 days after it files for protection from
creditors. After that period, creditors may file alternative
proposals.
   Public Service's exclusivity period ends May 27. Public Service
asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Yacos for an extension to next
Jan. 27, and for a hearing on its request on May 20.
   During a procedural hearing in February, Yacos had indicated he
was not inclined to grant an extension.
   Public Service, New Hampshire's largest power company, on Jan.
28 became the first big investor-owned electric utility to seek
bankruptcy protection since the Depression.
   The utility sought protection on the grounds it was financially
unable to continue operating without being able to recoup its
Seabrook investment. State law prohibited Public Service from
charging customers for its share of Seabrook until the plant was
operating commercially.
   Operation of Seabrook has been delayed by evacuation planning
snags.
   Public Service said the its unusual case mandated the extension
of the usual exclusivity period.
   ``The size, complexity and novelty of this case have prevented
the development of meaningful information, let alone meaningful
negotiations, within the 120-day plan exclusivity period...which
Congress designed for a case of average size and complexity,'' the
company said.
   ``Admittedly, an eight-month extension is more than is normally
requested or granted, but this is not a normal case.''
   Public Service also said there likely would be at least 10 major
parties in the negotiations, but not all appeared ready to start
the talks.
   Public Service also outlined reorganization options it is
considering: selling the company as a whole; internal
reorganization into a federally-regulated holding company;
reorganizing to remain under state regulation; and liquidation.
   Public Service noted that two New England utilities had
expressed interest in buying its non-Seabrook assets. The company
estimated it would take four to six months to complete preparations
for such a sale and reach a point where it could compare an
acquisition offer to other reorganization options.
   Regarding the holding company option, Public Service noted that
a principal cause of its financial problems was the state law
barring it from charging ratepayers for its Seabrook investment
until the plant operates commercially.
   But the company noted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
which regulates wholesale electricity, allows charges for
construction work in progress, or CWIP, for abandoned or cancelled
power plants.
   ``A restructuring of Public Service's operations to provide for
the sale of electricity at wholesale under FERC regulation could
thus significantly increase Public Service's revenues and value,''
the company said.
   Public Service sought bankruptcy protection two days after the
state Supreme Court denied an emergency rate increase by upholding
the ``anti-CWIP'' law. The company last month appealed the ruling
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
