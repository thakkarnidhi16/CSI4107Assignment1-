<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is being courted
by candidates and pursued by the press as curiosity mounts over
whether he will endorse anyone before his state's important April
19 presidential primary.
   Cuomo's closest advisers insisted Wednesday that they didn't
know when or even whether the inscrutable governor would give his
blessing to one of the Democrats competing for the party's
nomination.
   ``They've made it clear both publicly and privately they want
his endorsement,'' Cuomo press secretary Gary Fryer said of the
candidates. ``But at this point nothing has changed, despite the
4,000 phone calls we got.''
   ``He gets a constant stream of calls from the various
candidates,'' said Cuomo political adviser Meyer Frucher.
``Obviously, the front-runners have always wanted him to endorse
and the others try to keep him from endorsing.''
   Cuomo said in an interview published in Thursday's editions of
The Washington Post that he has not ruled out endorsing someone,
but added, ``The closer you get to primary day, the less reason''
there is to do so.
   The newspaper quoted the New York governor as saying he
preferred to remain neutral until after the final primaries and
then back the leader.
   ``That's the time for leadership in this process,'' he told the
Post.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, fresh from twin victories
this week in Colorado and Wisconsin, is seeking to solidify his
front-runner status _ and clear his path to the nomination _ with
another win over Jesse Jackson in New York.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., for his part, is making a major
effort in New York to succeed outside his native South. He has not
won a contest in a month and is no longer eligible for federal
matching funds.
   There are two reasons candidates are eager for Cuomo's
endorsement.
   First, the governor supported Walter Mondale in the 1984
election and, with the Cuomo team running his New York campaign,
Mondale scored a major victory.
   Second, and perhaps even more important to this year's
candidates, a Cuomo endorsement would reduce speculation that the
New York governor is angling for the nomination himself from a
deadlocked national convention and that he might be an available
alternative for Democrats.
   Dukakis set off a new round of speculation Tuesday when, asked
about a possible Cuomo endorsement, he chuckled and told reporters
in Boston that he planned to ``talk to you tomorrow.''
   But on Wednesday, Dukakis said he had nothing new to report.
   ``I'd like to have it (Cuomo's endorsement). He knows that. But
it's his decision to make,'' Dukakis said.
   ``This is getting to be kind of fun,'' Fryer said of the
interest over what Cuomo will do. ``Yesterday, we were inundated
with a wave of early morning `he's going to go with the Duke'
calls, all out of Boston. Then, a little bit later in the day,
there was a wave of `he's going with Gore' calls out of
Washington.''
   Cuomo aides and advisers said the candidates were treating Cuomo
carefully, perhaps even warily, in seeking his backing.
   ``They're not pressuring the governor in any sense of the
word,'' insisted Andrew Cuomo, the governor's son and chief
political adviser.
   ``This is one guy that is not susceptible to pressure,'' Fryer
added. ``If anything, pressure with Cuomo is counterproductive.''
   Cuomo and the candidates are all expected to appear separately
Thursday at a New York City meeting of about 300 members of the
state Democratic Committee. The candidates will be making
individual pitches to the Democratic officials, and Cuomo could use
the opportunity to make a dramatic endorsement.
   While the governor's political advisers said they doubted that
would happen, they said they did expect him to again stress that he
does not intend to become a candidate and that there should not be
a convention draft.
   Thus far, Cuomo has refused to completely rule out accepting a
convention draft, although he's said it won't happen and shouldn't
happen. He has maintained that should be enough of a disclaimer to
satisfy everyone.
   ``He'll reinforce that people should not wait for him to
endorse,'' said Andrew Cuomo of his father's expected advice to
fellow New York Democrats. ``He'll say again what he's said before:
`I'm not interested in running myself.'''

<TEXT>
   The National Academy of Motion Picture Arts &
Sciences' 60th awards might well be termed the Year of the Actress,
so impressive are the candidates for best performance by an actress
in 1987.
   After being overshadowed for a few decades by macho stars, film
actresses are now having powerful roles fashioned for them. This
year's nominees afford proof: Cher, the perplexed widow of
``Moonstruck''; Glenn Close, the vengeful spurned lover in ``Fatal
Attraction''; Holly Hunter, the dynamic news producer of
``Broadcast News''; Sally Kirkland, the faded Czech actress,
``Anna''; and Meryl Streep, the down-and-out ex-singer in
``Ironweed.''
   Adding to their impressive number are performances that many
felt warranted Academy consideration: Lillian Gish and Bette Davis,
``The Whales of August''; Sarah Miles, ``Hope and Glory''; Maggie
Smith, ``The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearn''; Christine Lahti,
``Housekeeping''; Faye Dunaway, ``Barfly''; Barbra Streisand,
``Nuts''; Joanne Woodward, ``The Glass Menagerie.''
   Cher has been drawing the most attention among the nominees,
attracting a media broadside of amazing proportions. The one-time
member of the Sonny and Cher singing team is justifiably proud of
her performance in ``Moonstruck'' and has been willing to talk
about it.
   ```Moonstruck' is the first movie of mine that I ever watched
without wanting to throw up,'' she says. ``I was in love with the
story; it's my best work since `Mask.'
   ``Usually everyone's first choice is Meryl (Streep) and then
so-and-so and then so-and-so. It's something to start being
someone's first choice. ... Jack Nicholson has clout, you know.
Barbra Streisand has clout. Jane Fonda has clout. I think relative
to them, I'm a newcomer. ... I'm not working my way toward power.
I'm working my way toward the best roles I can get.''
   Equally voluble is Sally Kirkland, who won the Golden Globe as
best dramatic actress for ``Anna.'' She has been enjoying her
success after years of trying: ``I have tested for the leading role
in 25 movies, and each time the choice has narrowed to another
actress and myself. Each time the other actress won.''
   The actress campaigned for the role in the low-budget film,
studying the Czech accent and absorbing the atmosphere of the
emigre community in New York. She even added 15 pounds and taped
her face to create wrinkles.
   Does she want the Oscar?
   ``I cannot tell a lie; my fantasy ever since I was 5 years old
has been to hold that (statue) and say, `Thank-you, thank-you,
thank-you.'''
   Holly Hunter, hailed as a bright new star because of ``Broadcast
News,'' has been as silent as Kirkland and Cher have been vocal.
She declined most interviews, arguing that she was too involved
with the Sam Shepard play, ``A Lie of the Mind,'' at Los Angeles'
Mark Taper Theater.
   Director James Brooks predicts the Georgia-born actress ``will
be around for decades.'' Of his script she commented: ``I loved it;
I thought it was remarkably three-dimensional.''
   She also talked about the differences between herself and the
news producer she portrays: ``Holly Hunter is certainly less driven
than Jane Craig. I think that my priorities are quite a bit
different, in that I'm probably retty obsessed myself, but not to
such a manic degree.''
   After three supporting-actress nominations in six film roles,
Glenn Close broke through in the starring category with ``Fatal
Attraction.'' She terms the demonic Alix the first woman she's
played ``who is out of control, who emotionally runs the gamut _
the first real, full-blooded role I've had.''
   Her comment on the huge reaction to ``Fatal Attraction'': ``The
whole male-female thing in this country is very volatile right now.
I think many women are feeling used by men. They invest a lot in a
relationship, in nurturing a man emotionally and in his career, but
they have their own careers and emotions, and they don't get that
nurturing in return.''
   After playing a number of glamorous roles, two-time Oscar winner
Meryl Streep found her role as the derelict in ``Ironweed'' had its
advantages: ``In this world of purgatory of the soul, there are
very few markers to go by. I liked that about her. I liked not
having to worry about how I looked and being able to strip away,
strip away everying, except what counts.''
   Streep has created a series of indelible performances, including
Oscar winners in ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ``Sophie's Choice,'' as
well as ``The Deer Hunter'' and ``Out of Africa.''
   She remains ambitious: ``There's so much I'd like to do. When
the public is used to you in heavy drama, it's hard to make them
take you seriously. But I want to play comedy.
   ``I can't stand it that stage fright inhibits me. At some point
I'm going to face up and do a play. But for now I just go day to
day.''

   Frank Sinatra called himself and Sammy Davis Jr.
``the Springsteen and Michael Jackson of the Geritol set''
Wednesday night as they launched into a ``Guys and Dolls'' medley,
the encore in their Rat Pack show.
   Radio City Music Hall wasn't exactly rocking, but it was
swinging.
   The 6,000-seat hall was sold out, with a top ticket price of $75.
   ``Let's not overdo it,'' Sinatra cautioned as Davis, making use
of a new hip replacement, did a few dance steps during the encore,
``because I'm tired of working alone.''
   Dean Martin had embarked with his old Las Vegas buddies on the
so-called Rat Pack tour earlier this year but has been sidelined in
recent weeks by kidney problems.
   ``We check with him every day,'' Davis assured the crowd. ``He
is cooking; he'll be back to work soon.''
   Davis, as thin as Sinatra used to be, did the first 40 minutes
of the two-hour show. He really sang jazz, and sometimes seemed to
be trying to pull the 37-piece band's ponderous arrangements up to
his swinging tempo.
   He had listeners' fingers snapping to ``Satin Doll,'' inserted
little jokes into the lyrics of ``The Lady Is a Tramp,'' put
powerful emotion into ``What Kind of Fool Am I?'' and ``Birth of
the Blues'' and made ``Mr. Bojangles'' into a one-act play. He was
never slick.
   Sinatra's voice sometimes has a frayed edge but his masterful
phrasing and timing of pithy asides are intact. More important, his
vocal timbre _ the thing that makes one know it's Sinatra and not
Vic Damone or somebody else _ is still there.
   He sang the ``Soliloquy'' from ``Carousel'' and the audience
exploded in applause. In it, he did some of his best singing of the
evening. The audience also seemed to appreciate his ambition in
choosing this high-quality, lengthy musical passage.
   Even better moments were Sinatra's hard-swinging ``Mack the
Knife'' and ``New York, New York'' and the all-time saloon song,
``One More for the Road,'' which he has sung many times but this
time also acted.
   When Sinatra and Davis harmonized beautifully on the final lines
of ``The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New
York,'' you knew you'd been thoroughly entertained.
   On their final night in town, Sunday, the Geritol boys will be
joined by Peggy Lee in a benefit for cancer research.

   Daily doses of the drug Ritalin are increasingly
the treatment of choice for children diagnosed with attention
deficit disorder. Not surprisingly, more and more clinics are
specializing in such diagnosis and treatment. And schools are often
enthusiastic about Ritalin's success. Two stories offer inside
looks at one such clinic, where an 11-year-old girl learned she
would begin what might be years of Ritalin therapy, and at a school
where teachers credit Ritalin with helping children conquer their
emotional and academic despair. A third story looks at Utah, the
state with the youngest population, a reputation for moral
conservatism _ and the highest per capita use of Ritalin in the
nation.

   Her school principal had urged her mother to make
the four-hour drive from rural northern Michigan. Now 11-year-old
Chrissie sat in a tiny, windowless office where a psychologist
peppered her with questions.
   The morning would end with doctors at the Attention Deficit
Disorder Clinic of Children's Hospital telling Chrissie her
baffling problems at home and in school would mean treatment with
the stimulant Ritalin, quite likely for years.
   But first doctors tested Chrissie: spelling tests, math tests,
reading tests, questions about her family life. They probed her
moods, whether she ever felt like committing suicide (``once or
twice,'' she said.) They examined her school grades, read reports
from teachers.
   They even had Chrissie, a sliver-thin, pretty girl with straight
blond hair, draw a picture of herself. The 2-inch-high sketch spoke
volumes to the psychologist about the youngster's poor self-image.
   Finally the psychologist asked Chrissie for three wishes.
   ``A horse ranch,'' the girl said after several moments. ``A
happy life. And people who care who can help me through this tough
time.
   ``I haven't really been happy since I was 2 or so. I yell at my
parents. Later I wish I hadn't done it. They're very good to me. So
I haven't had a very happy life.''
   Chrissie, which is not the girl's real name, indeed had many
problems, the doctors concluded. But she hardly fit the popular,
often mistaken, stereotype of children who take Ritalin.
   First, boys are eight times more likely than girls to be
diagnosed as having ADD. Second, Chrissie wasn't ``bouncing off the
walls.'' In fact, many youngsters recommended for Ritalin treatment
are not discipline problems and appear calm in most situations.
   Chrissie, said psychologist Arthur Robin, is ``a classic case of
a kid whose ADD was not caught as a young kid.'' Pre-adolescents
and teen-agers who unexplainedly struggle with school for years
often arrive at ADD clinics deeply depressed as a result of their
attention problems.
   The key was her inability to complete tasks and concentrate.
Tests suggested she was weak in math, easily frustrated,
dangerously depressed, and had a poor self-image.
   Chrissie knows she has troubles. ``I have quite a problem paying
attention in school. I've had it since kindergarten,'' she told a
visitor in a brief break from testing. ``I sometimes just have to
get out of my seat. I go to the drinking fountain, and I'm not even
thirsty. It's weird.
   ``If I have a problem, I'd really like to know about it.''
   Fewer than 100 such ADD clinics operate around the country,
according to Wade Horn, a psychologist who heads one at Children's
Hospital National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Nearly all
start with the assumption that ADD is essentially a physiological
disease that in most cases can be treated chemically.
   Some clinics simply juggle prescriptions, using placebos and
Ritalin or other stimulant drugs alternately to find the most
effective treatment. They leave the followup and monitoring to
others, often the family pediatrician.
   Others, like the Detroit clinic, employ pediatricians,
psychologists and social workers to look at the child in totality.
That means that counseling and changes in lessons or surroundings
are often part of the treatment. But at the heart of these clinics
is the conviction that Ritalin therapy helps most patients.
   Since it opened in September 1986, the ADD Clinic here has
examined some 600 patients and has a three-month waiting list, said
Dr. Sheldon Brenner, a pediatrician and co-director of the clinic.
At least three-quarters were diagnosed as having ADD, and about 85
percent of those were placed on medication, usually Ritalin.
   Once treatment begins, doctors rely on teacher questionnaires,
report cards and parents to monitor whether Ritalin is helping the
child in school and whether it is having side effects.
   Chrissie's teacher wrote this description of her on a Conners
Questionnaire, the standardized form used to evaluate children
suspected of having attention deficit disorder:
   ``Chrissie is not a behavior problem,'' her teacher wrote. ``I
just do not have her attention 90 percent of the time. ... On the
day we had our first bit of snow last fall, I was trying to help
her understand something. She looked at me and smiled, saying `I
wonder what my kitten thinks of snow? She never saw it before.'
Sometimes it seems her mind is way off somewhere else.''
   Chrissie and her mother sat expressionless as the doctors later
told them that Ritalin and psychological counseling ``should make a
difference.''
   Her mother expressed mild surprise over the prescription.
``Ritalin has a bad name,'' she said after the doctors had left the
room. ``I was somewhat surprised because I associated Ritalin with
hyperactivity.''
   How is Chrissie doing? After six weeks of Ritalin and
counseling, Chrissie's teachers told doctors she had shown mild
improvement in attention span and a marked improvement in her
ability to sit still and stick to school work. Even with an
increase in dosage, to 30 milligrams a day, she has exhibited no
side effects.
   Progress, but no quick miracles, then, for Chrissie. The Ritalin
therapy continues.

   One of Jane Easton's pupils takes
the drug Ritalin to calm his hyperactivity and help him pay
attention. She challenged a visitor to guess who.
   Chris was the obvious choice. Seated with three other boys at a
semicircular desk in a special education class at Scotch Elementary
School, the third-grader fidgeted in his chair, got up several
times to sharpen his pencil, drummed his fingers, asked questions
repeatedly and never seemed to hear the answers.
   The guess was wrong. Instead, the child on Ritalin was a slender
boy with flaming red hair who calmly sailed through a reading
comprehension quiz and listened attentively to a lesson on
homonyms. Easton says he's doing so well he probably will leave
handicapped classes forever in the fall.
   At Scotch Elementary, they believe in Ritalin _ and teachers
point to cases like these to vindicate their faith in the
controversial drug.
   Far from thinking Ritalin creates passive ``zombies,'' as some
critics have charged, teachers and parents alike in this affluent
northwest Detroit suburb seem convinced of Ritalin's track record
for turning emotional and academic despair into success.
   Grades and attention span often improve, and some youngsters who
might have spent entire school careers isolated in classes for the
disabled have managed to rejoin their regular peers with the help
of the drug.
   Most of all, teachers like Easton resent the assertion by some
that Ritalin is merely a cynical way for schools to silence problem
children while claiming they are trying to help them.
   ``I read that this is the way we treat kids we can't handle.
It's not true. It's just not true,'' said Easton, whose daughter
has taken the drug for four years.
   While an estimated 1-2 percent of the nation's 40 million
schoolchildren take Ritalin, Dr. Paul H. Wender, a Salt Lake City
psychiatrist and author of several books on attention deficit
disorder, or ADD, believes 3-to-10 percent of all children have
hyperactivity problems.
   At Scotch Elementary, approximately 5 percent of the 550 pupils
drop by principal Carl Childress's office each day to take a pill.
   Several elements help explain why Ritalin is commonplace at
Scotch Elementary; teachers and school administrators have attended
seminars and taken other training to recognize symptoms of ADD.
Area doctors are not only willing to prescribe Ritalin but also to
work with teachers and schools to monitor its success. And parents
generally seem to accept the professionalism, good faith and
judgment of the teachers and doctors.
   ``When you first start talking to parents about this, they're
devastated,'' said principal Carl Childress. ``Then 90 percent
react that it is a medical problem.''
   Childress tells of a youngster named George who has taken
Ritalin for two years. He had been assigned to a ``resource room,''
where handicapped children get individual instruction for part of
each day.
   ``He had an incident every day of losing his temper, punching
someone or screaming in vile terms,'' said Childress. ``Now he's
out of special education. He's a winner.''
   Childress, like other educators, insists ``we never recommend
medication.'' But that's only partly true. If the school's
psychologist, social worker or reading specialist believes a child
has ADD, they know which doctors will nearly always prescribe
Ritalin.
   At the top of the list is Dr. Ruth Robin, a pediatrician who
operates the Attention Deficit Center in nearby Southfield, Mich.
Schools from all over Michigan and northern Ohio recommend her, and
prospective patients often wait 6-8 weeks for an appointment. She
now treats 1,500 youngsters for ADD, some as young as 3. Almost
invariably, she prescribes Ritalin or similar medication.
   ``I work magic with the medicine,'' she said in an interview in
her office. ``I'm willing to try things.
   ``We're talking about large numbers of kids who are getting a
bum steer in life, from kindergarten on. Some look like couch
potatoes. They don't all look alike,'' she said.
   But even Ritalin's advocates admit it isn't always
well-monitored. Teachers are supposed to provide crucial
information enabling doctors to set the right dosage, or to
determine if drugs are necessary at all to academic success.
   Such monitoring is frequent when medication first begins. After
that, ``there really isn't that much to do unless there's a
problem,'' the doctor said.
   Childress said Robin and other ADD specialists typically send
teachers questionnaires to fill out for the first 2-4 weeks of
medication, then gradually less frequently until ``we feel we're on
a steady course. At a certain point we step out of the picture
unless the teacher notices a problem.''
   Still, Ritalin remains a ``last resort,'' said Childress.
Teachers might, for example, put distractible children in study
carrels _ desks with three sides blocked off so the child can't see
in front or to either side.
   But when ``we've exhausted all those things ... logged the
classroom observations,'' Childress said, ``we would just as soon
get a recommendation to try something else.''

   Utah is a state of large, close-knit
families whose religion frowns on the use of liquor and caffeine.
It is also a state with the nation's largest appetite for the
stimulant drug Ritalin.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration said that in 1986 pharmacies
along the state's Wasatch Front received 25,000 grams of the drug
used for hyperactive children, or 1,558 grams for every 100,000
population.
   That figure compares to 1,218 grams per 100,000 residents of
Maryland, the next highest Ritalin state. In New York, the figure
was 347 grams per 100,000.
   The reasons for Utah's high use of Ritalin are many. They may
point the way for the future in other parts of the country.
   ``What we are doing here is, in some ways, ahead of many parts
of the country,'' said Paul Wender, a psychiatrist and researcher
at the University of Utah.
   Utah has the youngest population of any state, with nearly a
quarter of its residents aged 5 to 17. It also leads the nation in
the size of individual families, about 4.3 children per household.
   Consequently it has the nation's most crowded classrooms with
24.6 students per teacher. Although Utah ranks near the top of the
list in the amount of state money, 47 percent, going to education,
it is last in per capita spending on education, at $2,372 per
student.
   So when the fragile balance in these overcrowded classrooms is
threatened by disruptive children, ``the pressures on parents and
teachers are going to lead people to look for solutions ... and one
of the solutions is medication,'' said Stevan Kukic, state director
of special education.
   In the Salt Lake School District, an estimated 2 percent of the
60,000 students receive Ritalin or one of its cousins for attention
deficit disorder, a syndrome that includes hyperactive as well as
inattentive pupils.
   ``It is becoming more acceptable in the parents' minds and the
teachers' minds,'' said Julie Miller, a special education teacher
whose son takes Ritalin. ``When the teachers see the dramatic
effect it can have on problem students, they want them medicated so
they can learn.''
   Sam Goldstein, a psychologist who saw 100 ADD children at his
clinic last year, estimates a quarter of his patients are referred
by the schools. Another 25 percent come at the suggestion of other
parents whose children take Ritalin. Half his patients were sent by
pediatricans.
   Utah's medical community also contributes to Ritalin use.
Reseachers at the University of Utah are considered leaders in ADD
study. Their philosophies are passed on to their students, many of
whom later set up practice nearby.
   As a result, Salt Lake has three clinics that specialize in the
diagnosis and treatment of ADD children _ many larger cities across
the country have none. Psychologists, psychiatrists and
pediatricians share information and refer patients for treatment.
   ``In a community this size it is easier to make an impact with
an idea, especially an idea that appeals to people,'' said
Goldstein.
   Parents of ADD children describe their successes with Ritalin as
more than appealing. Kathy Miner cries when she talks about the
effect Ritalin has had on her 11-year-old son, Jeremy.
   ``There has been such a remarkable change in this child,'' she
said. ``From the time he was 7 he talked about suicide. Now he's on
the student council and is so thrilled with life.''
   Mrs. Miner has joined others in a local support group for ADD
parents. The gatherings can be emotional: laughter about the
bruises and stitches their children have collected while rocketing
around the house, tears as they talk about the difference treatment
has brought.
   ``I wanted to share the knowledge with other families,'' said
the group's founder, Terri Steineckert, whose son, Tyler, 11, has
taken Ritalin for more than a year. ``It is very traumatic to put a
child on drugs, but if you have a good experience, you're
converted,'' she said.

   Three months ago, Mayor Mary Sheridan
stopped attending council meetings, changed her phone number and
refused to explain why she had forsaken her duties.
   For the last half-century, Ms. Sheridan had helped run the city
as city clerk, treasurer and finally as mayor in a homespun way
that endeared her to the townsfolk.
   But she has announced she will resign April 12, just 19 days
short of her 51st anniversary in city government.
   Council President John McManus said Monday he received Ms.
Sheridan's one-sentence resignation letter.
   ``I've been kind of expecting it,'' he said.
   Although Ms. Sheridan, 77, has said her doctor has told her to
``take it easy,'' the letter doesn't indicate why she is leaving.
   McManus, the acting mayor, said, ``We know as much now as we
did.''
   He said the council could choose a successor from a list of
three candidates to be submitted by the Hunterdon County Democratic
Party, but he is inclined to leave the seat vacant until the
November elections.
   ``We seem to be doing fine,'' he said. ``I'm certainly happy to
fill the void.''
   With 3,900 residents, Lambertville doesn't need a lot of
governing.
   The old mill and ferry town, which spreads along the east bank
of the Delaware River, comes to life in the summer when visitors
from Philadelphia and New York browse its art galleries, antique
shops, quaint cafes, bookstores and magnificent Victorian homes.
   An 85-year-old, two-lane iron bridge carries cars and pedestrian
across the wide, lazy river to New Hope, Pa.
   Ms. Sheridan's ties to the town go back several generations. She
was elected in 1982 and re-elected in 1985, but stopped attending
meetings in January, and shows up for work infrequently.
   She spoke briefly with a reporter one day last month while
walking down North Union Street in town. Asked about her absence,
Ms. Sheridan replied: ``Medical problems. Just say I can't work
because of medical problems.''
   ``My doctor says I have to take it easy. Now I don't want to
talk about it anymore.'' With that closing line, she walked briskly
across the street and into a five-and-dime.
   So, townspeople can only speculate about what happened.
   Some thought it was a political rift over whether to rehire
police Chief Jack Venettone, who suffered a heart attack last year.
The council in January overruled Ms. Sheridan and allowed him to
return.
   Others thought it had roots in the city's fiscal mess. In a 1987
audit, the Department of Community Affairs' Division of Local
Government Services concluded that the mayor had taken it upon
herself to maintain financial records and payroll documents which
the treasurer was required to handle.
   According to the audit, the minutes of the monthly council
meetings were not properly recorded. Vouchers lacked proper
signatures and invoices. The treasurer signed blank checks in
advance, which is prohibited by the state.
   ``There was nothing criminal, but there were certain things
being done up there that weren't according to Hoyle,'' said
department spokesman Richard Harpster. ``It was a mom-and-pop
operation.''
   Since that time, the Council has asserted its independence and
some say Ms. Sheridan has not taken that well.
   But no one really knows for sure. What is certain, however, is
the lifelong residents hold her in high regard.
   ``I like her very much,'' said Mabel Warner, 83. ``I always
thought she was very nice. She's always good with people of limited
incomes.''
   ``She's a woman who's cared for the city tremendously,'' added
businessman Dean Stephens.

<HEAD>Renegade Officer Condemns Aquino, Vows To Pursue Struggle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The fugitive leader of a coup attempt
last year claims President Corazon Aquino is incapable of ensuring
the suvival of the nation and he withdrew a pledge to avoid hostile
acts against her government.
   A statement carrying the signature of former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan, 39, was made available to news organizations
Wednesday by sources close to the renegade officer.
   Honasan escaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay last Saturday.
Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said a nationwide
search has turned up no trace of him.
   Honasan led an attempted coup on Aug. 28 in which at least 53
people were killed. Among the hundreds wounded was Mrs. Aquino's
only son, Benigno III.
   Honasan noted in the statement that his faction promised last
November to refrain from hostile acts against Mrs. Aquino to give
her time to fulfill promises to improve the government.
   ``We are now withdrawing that declaration,'' the statement said.
``It has become obvious by its own actions, that the Aquino
administration is incapable of ensuring the very survival of this
nation over the next few years. We have to act and act boldly.''
   Honasan, who was arrested Dec. 9, said he and others jailed in
previous coup attempts had been detained for months without formal
charges or trial.
   Honasan played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, military
uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos after thousands of
civilians joined the revolt. But he became disillusioned with Mrs.
Aquino after she succeeded to the presidency, accusing her of weak
and inept leadership in the face of the 19-year-old communist
insurgency.

<HEAD>Mexico Using Novel Approach To Combat AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alarmed by the fast spread of AIDS in the
country, Mexican authorities have begun a campaign called Cascade
Education, a novel approach that enlists those most likely to be
afflicted to spread the word.
   The campaign is aimed directly at male and female prostitutes,
the homosexual community, street gangs and the poor in the hope
that what they learn about AIDS prevention will ``cascade'' down to
others in their own vernacular.
   Most of the effort is concentrated in Mexico City, a metropolis
of 18 million people, where high-risk people are hard to reach
through newspapers and other standard means.
   ``We are teaching them to become health care promoters and
sending them into their communities,'' said Dr. Glorias Ornellas
Hall, director of the National Center for AIDS Information, an arm
of the federal Public Health Department.
   ``We believe that using the media to give information is not
enough to change behavior patterns. Only face-to-face contact can
do that,'' she said. ``The best way is for them to reach their own
communities in their own language. That includes prostitutes
reaching out to prostitutes, homosexuals to homosexuals, even
deaf-mutes to deaf-mutes.''
   According to the center, Mexico had 1,126 confirmed AIDS cases
as of Feb. 1, and the number is doubling every seven months. For
every confirmed case, an additional 50 to 100 people are becoming
exposed to the virus, said Dr. Jaime Sepulveda Amor, the
department's director of epidemiology.
   Sepulveda, who is also president of the government's National
Commission on AIDS Prevention, estimated during a recent interview
the number of people confirmed to have AIDS will reach over 25,000
by 1991, making it the second or third leading cause of death for
people in the 25 to 44 age group in Mexico, which has a population
estimated at 81.7 million.
   In the United States the number of AIDs cases reported since
June, 1981, has reached 57,024.
   Since it was founded last year, the information center has
broadcast its services on radio and television and through bumper
stickers, posters, keychains and matchbooks with condoms attached.
Mexico recently received a donation of 10 million condoms from the
U.S. Agency for International Development.
   The center also has trained dozens of Mexico City residents in
its Cascade Education program, offering instructional rclasses but
leaving the actual teaching process to each individual.
   ``We give them the basics, then leave the style of presentation
in their own hands,'' Ornellas said.
   The center's staff also trains street-gang leaders and visits
jails to teach police officials and prisoners.
   Ornellas said many of the Cascade volunteers from the streets
originally visited the center to be tested for the AIDS virus and,
with counselling and support, have joined the program. She said the
best of them are those who have tested positive.
   One male prostitute in the program, only known by his nickname
of Jaimito, regularly visits Mexico City markets to sing a
``ranchero'' song he wrote and recorded called, ``What is AIDS?''
   Ornellas called Jaimito ``one of our great promoters.''
   A deaf mute who also is a male prostitute is another is Cascade
promoter.
   ``He uncovered a whole sub-culture of deaf mutes who prostitute
themselves off to make a living,'' Ornellas said. ``We found that
many feel they have no other way to earn money.''
   An initial Health Department survey indicated that about 30
percent of the male homosexual community in Mexico City has been
exposed to the AIDS virus. Gerardo Ortega Zurita, a Cascade
volunteer leader, said cultural prejudices have made it very
difficult for homosexual men to seek help.
   ``There's incredible discrimination against homosexuals, who are
isolated from the centers of the country,'' Ortega said. ``Teaching
them about AIDS is difficult. They are forced to hide from the
police and other government authorities.''
   Ortega brings youths from what he calls ``controlled groups'' of
prostitutes to the center to be examined and learn about AIDS
prevention.
   ``But there are others we can't get to, who are more preoccupied
with making a living than with taking care of their lives,'' he
said.
   Ornellas and other health officials say the Cascade approach is
essential not only in reaching previously hidden subcultures but in
confronting many myths about AIDS.
   ``We've come across many beliefs,'' Ornellas said. ``Some say
AIDS is punishment from God, and others, that witchcraft can ward
it off. In a country with cultural setbacks that include religious
beliefs, ignorance and cultural taboos that do not allow the use of
condoms, we found that this program has worked.''
   Currently, Ornellas said the center is receiving 50 visits and
100 telephone queries a day from people wanting to find out about
AIDS.
   ``It's new that they should come out at all,'' she said.
   ``The very lowest class is the most at risk, and the hardest to
get to. There's a disrespect for life (among them); they don't care
if they die.''
   As in other countries in Latin America, the center had to
overcome initial resistance from the Roman Catholic Church in
distributing literature and promoting the use of condoms.
   Clerics are one way of reaching rural areas, Ornellas said.
   ``We haven't even started with rural people, where you have
whole families living in a single room. Children learn about sex in
one room. What's going to happen when AIDS reaches these rural
areas?''

   A web of unity has spread
through the occupied lands in four months of violence, drawing
Palestinian into committees for everything from tending emergency
gardens to running the rebellion.
   ``I think the idea is that this uprising is going to go on a
long time,'' said Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American who promotes
creation of civic action groups.
   Boys and businessmen of this middle-class town turned the earth
of a vacant lot this week and planted squash, tomatoes and
cucumbers so their neighborhood will have fresh produce during
curfews imposed by the Israeli army.
   Last month in Arura village, an Associated Press reporter spoke
with young Arabs who stood midnight watch to warn of approaching
soldiers.
   Nurses who got through an army blockade of Jerusalem's Shufat
refugee camp in February said health workers had formed a loose
network that could rush aid to areas where where Palestinians
clashed with soldiers.
   ``There are medical committees, agricultural committees, defense
committees,'' said Saeb Erakat, political science professor at Al
Najah University.
   ``Many of these committees work in the open,'' and more secret
groups organize strikes, protests and political activities in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, he said.
   Erakat said the young leaders of secret groups generally are
affiliated with factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``They may be new faces, but they will be new faces of
leadership of the PLO,'' he said. ``These are leaders who have
become leaders because they are doing something to attack the
occupation.''
   An underground network of PLO-affiliated leaders has shown its
strength by demanding, and getting, mass resignations of Arab
policemen in the occupied territories and nearly universal
acceptance of commercial strikes.
   Israel's attempts to crush the leadership with mass arrests have
not stopped the clandestine leaflets.
   Communique No. 11 told Arabs to boycott institutions linked to
Israel and form ``popular committees in every place, in city,
village, camp and street.''
   Leaflets urge people to ``cultivate the land'' increase
self-reliance, police themselves in the absence of Arab policemen
and start local manufacturing operations to lessen dependence on
the Israeli economy.
   Raja Shehadeh, a Palestinian lawyer, said neighborhood groups
had multiplied in tandem with economic and social hardships created
by the conflict that began Dec. 8.
   ``I think it's happening a lot, especially for security and
self-sufficiency,'' said Shehadeh, who leads a human rights group
in Ramallah called Law in the Service of Man. ``People are
experiencing a siege.''
   Awad, the Arab-American head of the Center for the Study of
Non-Violence in Jerusalem, said groups of 10 to 20 families have
formed throughout the West Bank, with the largest numbers in Beit
Sahur, Ramallah and Nablus.
   ``In Beit Jalla at Al Amal school, instead of having a
playground for kids they cultivate ... beans, cucumbers, onions,
tomatoes,'' he said.
   ``I think the idea is that this uprising is going to go on a
long time and the Israelis are going to push hard. ... The next
step is to make the Palestinians feel hungry.''
   Arab strikes and Israeli restrictions have complicated
deliveries of fresh produce, but canned and packaged goods are in
ample supply and there is no evidence of hunger.
   Many residents have stockpiled food. Others buy groceries from
farmers or merchants' homes rather than shops. When fresh produce
is available, Palestinians often cannot buy it because of curfews.
   Omar, a businessman in El Bireh, said two dozen households in
his neighborhood formed a committee at the end of March, when the
army sealed off the occupied territories for three days. He said
his four new hens had laid their first eggs.
   Less than a week later, he joined six men and eight children in
cultivating a vacant lot. While they worked, army trucks rolled
past shops that were closed for most of the previous week by a PLO
ban on afternoon work and Israel's refusal to let them open in the
morning.
   The businessman, who asked that his last name be withheld, said
the committee also had decided to start first aid classes, form
security patrols and build an emergency stock of food.
   ``We made a request to every house to buy a big bag of flour''
and arranged to buy food from store owners even when their shops
are closed, he said.
   ``People are now thinking of collecting wood for baking,''
Omar's wife said. Israel cut off supplies of fuel oil and gasoline
two weeks ago.
   Samir, another committee member, said the grassroots groups
would be harder for Israel to handle than labor unions, social
associations and schools.
   ``There is no infrastructure the Israelis can control,'' he
said. ``To put it down, they'll have to arrest everybody,'' and in
that case ``you're not succeeding. You've lost control.''

   What's a birthday without a party? Or,
in the case of this Southern Illinois city, what's a party without
a birth date?
   A city committee planning Edwardsville's 175th birthday bash has
disbanded, stymied over the actual year the community of 12,480 was
born.
   ``You know, everybody was going every which way _ really, nobody
could agree on one date,'' Kenny Krumeich, a member of the Birthday
Celebration Committee, said Tuesday. ``That was the main problem.
That was the stumbling block.''
   Shortly after the committee was formed last summer, it learned
that a common pleas court held its first session in the town in
1813, Krumeich said.
   Two history books set the year of Edwardsville's founding in
1819, but its incorporation as a town did not come until 1853 and
its incorporation as a city came 20 years after that.
   ``See the dilemma?'' asked former committee member Gail
Wolfskill. ``We couldn't seem to uncover when the actual date was.
That was the problem.''
   City officials will take up the issue of the city's birth in the
future, said Mayor Raymond Rogers, but he added no celebration will
be held this year.
   ``I hate to see that go by without any celebration,'' Krumeich
said, but, he added, ``We also have a 200-year celebration down the
road.''

cow-chip toss billed as ``the First Annual Ohio State
Championship.''
   The local Lions Club plans to invite Scott, the weather
forecaster on NBC's ``Today'' show, and Gov. Richard Celeste to
join other contestants in seeing how far they can hurl a
6-inch-wide cow chip, said organizer Chuck Williamson.
   ``Contestants can lick their fingers, but that's optional,''
Williamson said Tuesday.
   The toss will take place Sept. 10 outside Waverly High School,
Williamson said. He advised a friend to start giving his 300 head
of cattle laxatives because organizers will need about 500 chips.
   ``We're billing it as the First Annual Ohio State
Championship,'' Williamson said. ``If someone objects, we'll call
it the Southern Ohio Championship.''
   Invitations were being sent to Scott and Celeste this week, he

   Overtaxed taxpayers who feel rubbed the
wrong way by the Internal Revenue Service will be offered a chance
to relax April 15 when a massage school offers free ``income-tax
stress relief.''
   The East-West College of Massage Therapy celebrates its
re-opening that day, the deadline for filing federal income-tax
returns, with free massages by appointment at its new location.
Certified public accountants, who will probably be too busy April
15, will be offered the free half-hour massages the following day.
   ``Since we are a school of massage therapy, we asked ourselves
who would be most stressed out on April 15? It would be people who
deal with income tax,'' college director Jerome Perlinski said
Tuesday. ``It was sort of a natural.''
   The college, started in 1972, offers training in massage and
plans to offer walk-in massages at its new downtown location.
   ``What we're trying to do is offer a service to busy downtown
professionals who are under a lot of stress,'' spokeswoman Marilyn
Verridjen said.

   It was inaugurated in a ceremony on Tuesday.
   Costs of acquiring the plant, which will be powered by thermal

   Police defused an incendiary bomb planted in a

has been targeted by animal rights activists for selling fur coats.
   The bomb was found Tuesday by an employee in the third-floor,
furniture section of Debenhams in Oxford Street, a busy shopping
thoroughfare in central London, shortly after the store closed at 6
p.m. (1 p.m. EDT), Scotland Yard said. The store was evacuated and
part of Oxford Street was closed to traffic.
   Inspector John Chilvers said a bomb disposal unit took nearly
three hours to defuse the device. He said police were investigating
whether the bomb was linked to the previous attacks by an animal
rights group.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility.
   Debenhams has been a target of firebomb and other attacks by the
Animal Liberation Front for more than four years.

<HEAD>FCC Looking Into Practices of New Phone Operator Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is
advising consumers to beware when using hotel, hospital and pay
telephones to make operator-assisted calls.
   The agency has received 260 complaints since January from irate
callers who were billed by a company they had never heard of, at
rates that were several times the rates charged by the major
long-distance companies.
   In one case, the charges were 10 times higher, the FCC said.
   The complaints have prompted the FCC to begin looking into the
practices of alternative operator services, known as AOS companies,
which have emerged to compete in a $7 billion-a-year market that
until recently was served only by American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   ``We've never seen a situation quite like this addressed by the
commission,'' describing the complex nature of the problem AOS
companies pose, said Greg Vogt, chief of the FCC's telephone
enforcement division.
   ``We don't want to have a knee-jerk reaction that could kill an
industry,'' he said, adding that the commission needs more
information before deciding whether federal action is warranted.
   AOS companies began forming within the past two years ago to
fill the void left when AT&T stopped paying commissions to hotels
and motels on the long-distance calls made by their guests.
   Atleast some of the AOS companies kick back money to the
contracting hospital, hotel, motel or other business.
   The AOS companies, now estimated to number around 40, handle
calls mainly made by the transient public in hotels, motels and at
pay phones as well as hospitals and universities. They handle
credit-card, collect and third-party billed calls.
   Typical complaints, the FCC said, are that callers are given no
indication that an AOS company is handling their calls or that they
will be billed at higher rates than those of the company whose
long-distance credit card they are using.
   AOS rates are not regulated by the FCC. The commission regulates
the rates AT&T can charge but not the rates of any other
long-distance companies because none is large enough to control
market prices.
   In complaints investigated by the FCC, the AOS companies have
refunded the disputed amount, Vogt said.
   At an establishment served by an AOS company, callers who dial
``0'' for an operator are routed to the AOS. An operator gets
billing information and then sends the call over a line the AOS
leases from one of the long-distance carriers, like AT&T or MCI
Communications Corp.
   Many of the callers who end up connected to an AOS company are
those using a credit card issued by a local Bell phone company or
AT&T, since use of those cards require callers to start by dialing
a ``0.'' Other companies' cards require callers to dial a local or
800 number to place their call.
   Most of the AOS companies have billing contracts with the Bell
companies, which means callers receive the AOS charges along with
their monthly local Bell phone bill. Some AOS companies also accept
payment by other credit cards such as MasterCard and Visa.
   The FCC advises that callers ask an operator what company they
work for, what rates they will be charged and how they will be
billed before placing the call. If they are dissatisfied, they
should find another phone, the FCC says.
   Several states have begun considering regulation of AOS
companies because of complaints and some have issued consumer
alerts.
   AOS companies say theirs is a new and growing industry to which
consumers haven't yet become accustomed. The major AOS companies
say their operators are trained to identify themselves to callers
before placing their calls.
   Vogt said, however, that some AOS companies can place automated
calls, which substitute ``bong'' tones for a live operator to
instruct callers on how to proceed with a credit card. There is no
federal requirement for AOS companies to identify themselves, he
said.

   The number of Americans caught in foreign drug
busts jumped 22 percent last year, the State Department reported in
an effort to scare U.S. tourists out of taking controlled
substances on overseas vacations.
   ``As we approach the busy travel season, many Americans are
getting ready for that long-awaited trip abroad; for some, the trip
will become a nightmare,'' the department said Tuesday in a report
to Congress.
   Police abroad seized 1,242 Americans on drug charges last year,
compared with 1,013 in 1986, the report said.
   The biggest increases in drug-related arrests of Americans were
in Mexico and Jamaica, where governments are under pressure from
Washington to get tough on narcotics.
   Of the 3,041 Americans taken into custody in foreign countries,
41 percent were suspected of drug violations.
   ``Americans have been arrested for possessing as little as a
third of an ounce of marijuana,'' the report said.
   It added: ``Those Americans who assume there is no real danger
in buying or carrying just a `small' amount of drugs on their
overseas trip may be in for a very unpleasant surprise.
   ``Many travelers also assume that, as American citizens, they
are immune from prosecution under foreign laws.''
   That was underscored Tuesday by a Spanish court's conviction of
Conan Owen, a 23-year-old Virginia photographer, on cocaine
importation charges. Despite U.S. government belief that Owen was
an innocent traveler duped by an acquaintance into carrying the
drugs into Spain, he was sentenced to six years in jail.
   The 10 countries that arrested the most Americans on all charges
last year were Mexico, 990; Jamaica, 346; Canada, 267; the Bahamas,
196; West Germany, 128; Britain, 124; the Dominican Republic, 74;
Japan, 60; Spain, 53 and Israel, 52.
   At year's end, 596 Americans were serving jail sentences
overseas.
   Mexico, Canada, Britain and Spain have inmate transfer treaties
that permit offenders to serve their sentences in jails in their
homeland, but fewer prisoners than normal were able to return to
the United States last year because U.S. federal prisons didn't
have enough space.
   Riots among Cubans at federal penitentiaries in Oakdale, La. and
Atlanta, Ga., aggravated the crowding.
   The largest number of inmate mistreatment complaints from
Americans abroad came from Mexico, notably those in the San Luis
Rio Colorado prison near Hermosillo.
   About one-fourth of the 164 Americans arrested in that area of
northern Mexico complained of mistreatment and ``U.S. officials
found such reports credible and made a vigorous formal protest in
August,'' the report said.
   Since then, no reports of mistreatment at that prison have been
received, the report said.
   Several countries prevented U.S. assistance to Americans with
dual nationality. TheSoviet Union, as in the past, refused to grant
access to three prisoners with U.S. nationality and obstacles also
were raised in cases in Cuba, Egypt, Italy and Botswana, the report
said.
   The U.S. embassy in Romania also received complaints from
American tourists detained at the border for alleged customs
violations. Most of the Americans were fined in dollars _ scarce
currency in Romania _ and released within 24 hours.
   The number of Americans incarcerated in Saudi Arabia declined
last year, mostly because that country relaxed punishments against
foreigners accused of breaking the Islamic ban on alcoholic
beverages.
   Instead of sentencing liquor possessors to jail, Saudi Arabia
now usually deports them, the report said.
   Americans in Thailand benefited from a round of pardons granted
on the 60th birthday of the king. Several U.S. prisoners were
released and a few others had their sentences reduced. Still, 30
Americans remained in Thailand's ``substandard'' prisons at the end
of the year.
   The State Department spent $46,000 on medical assistance and
food for needy U.S. prisoners, more than $20,000 of which went to
American inmates in Thailand, according to the report.

<HEAD>Lower Costs, Higher Prices Benefit Hog And Cattle Farmers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The long-awaited financial turnaround for U.S.
agriculture has been led by a two-year economic boomlet in the
livestock sector, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   ``Since the fourth quarter of 1985, hog and cattle farmers have
benefited from generally higher prices and lower feed costs,'' the
report said. ``Feed expenses declined by $2.4 billion during
1985-87, while hog and cattle (sales) receipts increased by $4.7
billion.''
   Further, poultry and egg sales increased $1.5 billion in 1986
before declining last year.
   According to USDA economists, the net cash income of farmers _
what's left over from gross cash income after deducting cash
expenses _ rose to a record $57 billion in 1987 from $52 billion in
1986 and $47.3 billion in 1985. Some decline is expected this year
to between $50 billion and $55 billion.
   The report by the department's Economic Research Service was in
the current issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine and was written
by Gregory Hanson and Richard Kodl.
   ``More than 80 percent of the $10 billion increase in net cash
income from 1985 to 1987 went to livestock producers,'' the report
said. ``Strong growth in net cash income was shared by most major
livestock enterprises in 1986, and by hog, dairy and beef farms in
1987.''
   The darker side was among crop producers who saw feed grain
receipts decline from their 1985 peak, contributing to the recent
financial stress on Midwest crop farms.
   ``However, the strong rebound in livestock earnings has provided
an important offset in this region,'' the report said. ``Five of
the top 10 cattle producing states and seven of the top 10 hog
producing states are located in the northern plains (from North
Dakota to Kansas) and western Corn Belt (Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota,
Missouri and Wisconsin).''
   The gains in livestock receipts and big increases in government
payments translated into increases of 70 percent to 80 percent in
the net cash incomes of farmers in the two regions, the report said.
   ``Farmers used their higher incomes to pay down more than $6
billion of farm business and household debt annually during
1984-87,'' the report said. ``They are now in a position to reap
substantial benefits in 1988 from continued livestock profits and
from recovering crop profits.''
   The overall debt crunch of the early and mid-1980s ``has
subsided,'' the report said. ``By the end of this year business
debt in agriculture likely will have fallen $55 billion to $60
billion, or nearly one-third, since 1983.''
   It added: ``Farmers' recent financial progress is evident in the
closely watched debt-to-asset ratio, which measures the degree of
lender security and the farmers' use of their earnings and capital
to finance farming operations.''
   After climbing to 23 percent in 1985 _ which meant farers owed
$23 for every $100 worth of assets _ economists said the
debt-to-asset ratio nationally declined to an estimated 17 percent
to 19 percent by 1988.

   China has been given approval by the
Agriculture Department to buy an additional 2 million metric tons
of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Acting Undersecretary Thomas O. Kay said Tuesday that China has
already bought more than 4.9 million tons of U.S. wheat under
previously announced authorizations under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have ranged from less than $20 to more than $40
per ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   The Soviet Union also has been a big buyer of U.S. wheat under
EEP, with purchases totaling more than 11.8 million tons in the
last year. An additional 1 million tons of EEP wheat for the
Soviets were authorized earlier in the week.

   Public comments are being sought on how to
define a ``person'' for purposes of determining federal limits on
payments to farmers, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   There are limits on federal payments to individuals, including
benefits paid under commodity price support programs, the
Conservation Reserve Program and some other programs where direct
payments are made.
   Additionally, the proposed rule would determine whether
foreigners will be eligible to receive certain program payments.
   In budget legislation late last year, Congress included a number
of provisions designed to tighten loopholes in USDA farm payment
regulations, beginning with 1989 crops.
   The law provides, for example, that to qualify for payments a
``person'' must be actively engaged in farming by providing a
significant amount of capital, equipment or land, and personal
labor or management to the enterprise.
   A basic limit of $50,000 per person annually is set on direct
``deficiency'' payments, but this can be ballooned to as much as
$100,000 maximum depending on a person's interest in other entities.
   The term ``person'' can include individuals, corporations,
associations, charitable organizations or other entity as
determined by USDA.
   A recent study by the department's Economic Research Service
says the law requires the secretary of agriculture ``to give fair
and equitable treatment to trusts and estates and the beneficiaries
thereof, and provides that spouses may be separate persons if their
farming operations were separate prior to their marriage and
continue to be operated separately.''
   Written comments can be sent by May 6 to: Director, Cotton,
Grain and Rice Price Support Division, ASCS-USDA, P.O. Box 2415,
Washington, D.C. 20013.

   Amnesty International appealed to the Libyan
people's congresses to support Col. Moammar Gadhafi's stated aim to
abolish the death penalty in the north African nation.
   The London-based human rights organization said the Libyan
leader called on the people's congresses to hold a special session
soon to discuss his proposed changes in human rights' laws,
including the abolition of the death penalty.
   The congresses are supposed to have absolute power over
government policy under the socialist system devised by Gadhafi in
1977.
   Amnesty International opposes the death penalty as cruel,
inhuman and degrading punishment.
   Its abolition, the organization said in a statement Tuesday,
would be a ``major step in the respect of human rights by the
Libyan Jamahiriya,'' or ``the masses,'' which is how Libya refers
to itself.

<HEAD>Wealthiest 1 Percent Pays 26 Percent of Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of high-income Americans has risen
sharply during the Reagan administration, and so has their share of
the total federal tax burden.
   The 1 million or so couples and individuals whose incomes put
them among the nation's wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers paid 26.1
percent of all personal income taxes collected in 1986, the
Treasury Department says. That share is up from 18.1 percent in
1981, when President Reagan took office.
   In its study issued Tuesday, the department did not say what
income level would place taxpayers into that highest 1 percent.
   But it issued a parallel set of statistics showing that during
the same period, the share borne by those making over $100,000 rose
from 15.2 percent of the total to 30.6 percent.
   Meanwhile, the portion of taxes paid by those with incomes under
$50,000 _ the majority of Americans _ dropped from 66.8 percent in
1981, before enactment of across-the-board tax cuts, to 45.7
percent in 1986, the department said.
   Those in between, making $50,000 to $100,000, paid the rest,
with their share rising from 18 percent to 23.7 percent.
   The Treasury attributed part of the higher tax payments by the
wealthy to ``the extraordinary level of capital gains realized in
1986 in anticipation of the 1987 rate increase on capital gains.''
   In 1986, the maximum tax rate on capital gains, which are
profits from the sale of stock, real estate and other investments,
was 20 percent. Knowing the rate would rise to 28 percent in 1987,
investors sold billions of dollars worth of assets in the closing
days of 1986, which boosted their total incomes for that year.
   That sell-off helped capital gains account for nearly 25 percent
of the total income of the richest 1 percent of Americans in 1986.
In 1985, capital gains accounted for 15 percent; in 1981, 11
percent. By contrast, capital gains make up on the average less
than 2 percent of the income of the other 99 percent of Americans.
   The preliminary analysis is based on a sampling of tax returns
filed last year, reflecting income earned in 1986.
   The study made no attempt to fully explain the growing share of
taxes paid by the richest Americans. However, once its analysis is
complete, the administration is likely to claim that the increase
results from the big 1981 across-the-board tax cut that Congress
enacted at Reagan's behest.
   That law slashed the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50
percent. It since has been cut to 33 percent.
   The administration reasons that reducing tax rates gives workers
and investors incentive to produce and save more.
   Inflation and economic growth have helped boost incomes and,
thus, increase the number of taxpayers who make more than $100,000
a year. In 1986, about 12 of every 1,000 couples and individuals
topped that level. The analysis found those taxpayers paid $43
billion in taxes in 1981, $77 billion in 1985 and $115 billion in
1986.
   The IRS says more than 1.2 million couples and individuals
earned over $100,000 in 1985, an increase of 63 percent over 1982.
   The number earning over $1 million a year more than doubled from
1982 to 1985, to 17,312.
   Between 1981 and 1986, taxes paid by those with incomes between
$50,000 and $100,000 increased from $51 billion to $89 billion. The
burden on those under $50,000 dropped from $190 billion to $172
billion.
   About half of Americans have incomes under $35,000 a year,
including those who are too poor to pay taxes. They paid 7.5
percent of the individual income tax in 1981 and 6.4 percent in
1986.

<HEAD>US Median Age Sets Record High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are easing into their middle years,
as growing numbers of maturing Baby Boomers boost the nation's
median age to a record high of just over 32 years.
   The 35-44 age group represents the leading edge of the
post-World War II Baby Boom and is the fastest-growing segment of
the U.S. population, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.
   And the population segments aged 85 and over and 75-84 rank
second and third in growth since 1980, the Bureau said.
   This combination helped boost the nation's median age to 32.1
years as of last July 1, the highest ever.
   ``The `Graying of America' is ... documented by its increasing
age,'' observed bureau statistician Louisa Miller.
   Up from 31.8 in 1986, the median means that half of all
Americans are older than that age and half younger.
   By race, blacks remain younger than whites, although both groups
are maturing.
   For whites, the median age hit 33 for the first time, up from
32.7 in 1986. Black median age was 27.2, up from 26.9 and the first
time that group had surpassed 27.
   The nation's median age first reached 30 in 1950, but the rapid
growth of the Baby Boom that was then occurring pulled it back down
in the following years. The Baby Boom consists of the estimated 20
million Americans born between 1946 and 1965.
   With the maturing of the Baby Boomers, the median has begun
moving in the other direction. The growing elderly population has
also helped raise the median, as improved medical care extends
lifepsans.
   ``The repercussions of the Baby Boom are many and varied,''
Miller said. ``They will continue to affect the United States for
many years to come.''
   They are now at the age where they have more discretionary
income and the effect can be seen in the nation's culture and
marketing, she said.
   The generation's arrival spurred a boom in sales of baby
products. It then proceeded to overwhelm the school system,
following up with creation of a national orientation toward
teen-age music and styles.
   Now, as the Baby Boomers set up more and smaller households,
they are prompting a boom in housing sales and household goods,
marketing experts say.
   ``Further down the road, once they begin to reach retirement
age, they will obviously have a great effect on the direction the
country takes,'' Miller added.
   Meanwhile, the Boomers are being followed by the much smaller
Baby Bust generation, leaving fast-food outlets, retail stores and
others offering ``first jobs'' searching for employees, she said.
   The Boomers boosted the 35-44 age group by 33.8 percent between
1980 and 1987 to some 34.4 million people, the bureau reported.
   The 25-34 age group remains the most numerous with 43.5 million
members, but that is up only 16.8 percent from 1980, the study
noted.
   When Americans now in that age group move on, they will have few
replacements.
   Between 1980 and 1987 the 18-24 group declined by 9.7 percent to
27.3 million, and those aged 14-17 fell 11 percent to 14.4 million.
   Even the 5-13 group slipped 1.1 percent to 30.8 million, but
those under 5 jumped 11.6 percent in the Baby Boom echo. They
totaled 18.2 million.
   The second-fastest growing segment was aged 85 and over,
increasing 28 percent to 2.2 million. The 75-84 group was third,
jumping 20.3 percent to 7.7 million. Americans in the 65-74 group
increased 13.4 percent to 17.7 million.
   Turning to the small groups born in the Depression and World War
II: The 45- to 54-year-old group increased only 2.1 percent to 23.3
million and those 55-64 were up 1.5 percent to 22.0 million.

   One of more than 30 people flown to
Western Europe and New York for treatment of mustard gas poisoning
suffered in alleged chemical weapons attacks in the Persian Gulf
war has died, a doctor said.
   Zaindi, a 20-year-old Iranian volunteer soldier was one of the
most seriously injured patients brought to Europe by Iran on March
29.
   Dr. Gerhard Freilinger, head of Vienna's University Clinic
plastic surgery, said Zaindi had improved, but then got worse and
died of his injuries Tuesday.
   The plane made its first stop in Vienna, and Freilinger, who has
treated more than 30 alleged chemical weapons attack victims since
1984, had the Iranian removed from the plane for treatment in
Vienna because his condition was too serious for him to be able to
bear the continued trip.
   Iran charged the Iraqi air force in March dropped cyanide and
mustard gas bombs on three Kurdish towns in Iraq that had been
captured by Iran, killing 5,000 Kurds and injuring 5,000.

<HEAD>Spiffy `USA Today - The Television Show' Previewed</HEAD>

   It's fast, it's colorful, it's as spiffy as can
be. It's ``USA Today'' on TV.
   Executive producer Steve Friedman unveiled a prototype of the
syndicated, daily television show and his four-person anchor team
Tuesday at one of a series of news conferences, this one in the
Rainbow Room, upstairs from his old office at NBC where he was
executive producer of ``Today.''
   ``USA Today _ The Television Show'' premieres on Sept. 12, but
is already a hit, having been sold in 118 markets covering 85
percent of the country. That gives it, higher coverage than any
syndicated show except ``Wheel of Fortune,'' Friedman said.
   The promotional reel Friedman showed reporters promised stations
considering buying the show that it would take them ``into the
'90s.''
   ``It's a fast-paced world and I think a lot of the media hasn't
caught up,'' said Friedman, after showing the tape. The pace of the
promotional show, complete with commercials, was fast to spin heads.
   Not surprisingly, Friedman assured reporters that ``USA Today''
won't be a ``traditional'' news show but rather will rely on upbeat
human-interest stories, polls and interviews.
   Since it's based on the colorful, successful, young national
newspaper, it ``doesn't have any baggage from the past,'' he said.
``We don't have to worry about what Ed Murrow said.''
   The show is the first product from GTG Entertainment, the
partnership between former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker, who is also
former president of MTM Productions, and Gannett, the publisher of
USA Today and the nation's largest newspaper group. GTG is also
producing network entertainment shows.
   ``USA Today _ The Television Show'' will be a half hour daily,
an hour on weekends. The show will be fed to stations each day via
satellite at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Friedman said 96 of the
stations will broadcast the show in what he considers its ideal
time period, the hour between the evening news and the beginning of
prime time.
   Friedman has assembled a good-looking cast of network veterans
to anchor the four segments, based on the four sections of the
newspaper: Edie Magnus from ABC as ``Front Page'' anchor; Kenneth
Walker, also formerly with ABC, as ``Money'' editor; Bill Macatee
of NBC for ``Sports'' and Robin Young, also formerly with NBC, for
``Life.''
   The show will preview the next day's edition of ``USA Today,''
but not necessarily have the same stories as the newspaper.
   ``It will be topical, but to be successful it will have to be
different,'' said Magnus. ``We will be doing what would be the next
day's lead the night before.''
   Macatee suggested he might have coaches other than baseball
managers wear uniforms for a segment.
   ``Or let's have the head of an airline dress like a pilot for a
day to see how it fits, see how people react,'' he said.
   A daily poll will be the centerpiece of the show, Friedman said.
The promotional tape featured a poll on marriage, using clips from
movies to illustrate the results, for example, ``Body Heat''
illustrating a question about infidelity.
   Academy Award-winning composer John Barry, who wrote the theme,
was featured in an interview in the promotional tape describing the
music, much like the show, as having ``a happy, laid-back feeling,
but with a sense of urgency.''
   USA Today isn't the only newspaper getting into the act. The
Christian Science Monitor, which has a radio show, is holding a
news conference later this week to announce its own television show.

   Hands shielding swollen eyes from the glare of
television lights, the three little girls squirmed uncomfortably in
the hospital room as they were displayed as survivors of a poison
gas attack.
   The girls are among five victims being treated in the United
States for chemical burns to the lung, eyes and skin. Iran says
they are survivors of a March 16 chemical attack by Iraq on the
Kurdish village of Halabjah.
   Four of them met reporters Tuesday in an event organized by the
Iranian mission to the United Nations, the arena for a bitter
propaganda war between Iran and Iraq. The Persian Gulf enemies have
been fighting for 7{ years.
   One patient, Nazanin Hassan, 30, was not shown to reporters
because she is in the intensive care unit.
   The Tehran government says Iraq bombed its own citizens with
chemical weapons _ killing 5,000 and injuring 7,000 _ after members
of the restive Kurdish minority welcomed invading Iranian troops to
Halabjah.
   Mohamed Azizi, a 25-year-old university student, said Iraqi
forces attacked the village several times in response to Kurdish
unrest. But Azizi said even from the shelter of his basement, he
knew the March 16 attack was different.
   ``We smelled the gas,'' he explained through an intepreter. ``We
knew it was not the other kind of bomb,'' the ordinary kind.
   Azizi said from his hospital bed that when he ventured outside
hours later, he saw streets strewn with the victims of what doctors
in the United States suspect was mustard gas, a World War I weapon
outlawed worldwide since 1925.
   ``Any door you opened there were children, men and women, dying,
dead,'' Azizi said, his words punctuated by rough coughs. ``I saw a
lot of people in cars. As many as 10, 11, 12 in a car. They were
dying.''
   He said he and other stunned survivors began streaming out of
Halabjah.
   ``We tried to run out,'' Azizi said. ``We didn't want to see
that.''
   But he said that once outside, he was soon sickened by the gas.
   ``My eyes felt heavy. It was hard to breathe. Eight or nine
times I threw up. I smelled gas,'' he recounted.
   Doctors at St. John's Episcopal Hospital, in New York City's
borough of Queens, said all five of those brought to New York
suffered lung and eye damage and from burns. One child is also
showing signs of bone marrow damage, said Dr. Deborah
Lief-Dienstag, head of the pediatrics department.
   She said the long-term prognogis for a gassing victim is unclear.
   ``I can tell you what a gunshot wound is. I can tell you what's
going to happen to the patient,'' she said.
   ``But I don't know what's going to happen to these children. I
don't know what's going to happen to their lungs in six months and
I don't think anyone else does either, including all the experts
we've spoken to.''
   Dr. Lief-Dienstag's young patients were clearly uneasy when
Iranian officials escorted journalists to their room. Several
doctors expressed concern about infection. One, speaking on
condition he not be identified, said emphatically that the news
media visit ``wasn't our idea.''
   Iran transferred small contingents of survivors from hospitals
in Tehran to hospitals in major European cities and to St. John's.
   Dr. Meyd Atabaki, an Iranian who is an attending physician at
St. John's, said all five brought to New York had to be sedated at
first before they could be treated.
   ``They cried for 24 hours after they got here,'' Dr.
Lief-Dienstag said.
   Hospital officials say psychiatrists are following the progress
of all five patients, particularly the children, who were orphaned
by the attack.
   ``They are innocent bystanders who ... were in the wrong place
at the wrong time,'' Dr. Lief-Dienstag said of Javan Mohammed
Abdollah, 12, and her sister, Rezen Mohammed Abdollah, 9, and Kobra
Mohammad, also 9.
   Dr. Victor Burnett, head of the department of medicine, said he
and the other doctors at St. John's consulted experts in chemical
injuries from the University of Ghent in Belgium and from the U.S.
Army.
   Amir Zamani, a first secretary at the Iranian mission, said Iran
sent about 100 victims to hospitals abroad because Iran's hospitals
ran out of room.
   The United Nations, which earlier confirmed several Iraqi
attacks with outlawed mustard gas and nerve gas during the war, has
sent a team to investigate the Halabjah attack.
   Iraq, meanwhile, is accusing Iran of using the banned weapons.
On Monday, it asked for a U.N. team to go to Baghdad to examine 88
soldiers it says were gassed.

<TEXT>
   Ground personnel at Rome's Leonardo Da Vinci airport
announced they will stage 12-hour strikes on April 16 and 24.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the strikes are expected to
force the cancellation or postponement of most flights on those two
days.
   Union leaders on Tuesday said the strike would not interfere
with flights for emergency, military or government purposes.
Flights to and from Italy's islands also will not be interrupted.
   Waves of recent airline and railway strikes in Italy over the
last five months have made traveling difficult to plan.
   Ground crews have been negotiating for a new contract for eight
months. For the last five months, the crews have staged periodic
strikes.
   They are demanding better working conditions in the control
towers, salary increases and fewer hours in the work week.

   Income tax cuts in the United States have
encouraged cuts in 10 other major countries, according to a study
distributed by the Brookings Institution.
   ``The movement ... also reflects the almost universal
recognition of the distortions and inequities created by high tax
rates, years of inflation and ineffective tax preferences,'' says
Joseph A. Pechman, president-elect of the American Economic
Association, who edited the report.
   Brookings is a private policy-research organization. Its study
includes analyses by tax officials from Australia, Canada, Denmark,
France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden,
Britain and the United States.
   It does not deal with the Soviet Union, where Communist Party
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has announced a plan for a progressive
income tax _ higher taxes on higher incomes. It comes just as
non-communist countries are making their rates less progressive.
   None of the new top rates in the 10 non-communist countries is
as low as the 33 percent that goes into effect for this year in the
United States. But Japan's 1984 top rate of 88 percent will be down
to 76 percent by 1990 and West Germany's 56 percent is dropping to
53 percent.
   The highest French rate is going down to 57 percent from 65
percent while Italy's is dropping from 65 to 60 percent.
   Of the 10, only Britain's top rate of 60 percent will hold
steady from 1984 to 1990. It was reduced from 83 percent in 1979,
when Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher embraced the tax
cut movement.
   One contributor to the study, Sijbren Cnossen of Erasmus
University in Rotterdam, Holland, criticizes the flattening of
rates in the United States.
   ``In most European countries ... it has long been realized that
poverty issues must largely be addressed through the welfare
system,'' he writes.
   ``As a result of these countries' pervasive social security
systems, the income distribution has become much less unequal than,
say 40 years ago.''
   He does not mention Japan, where the social security system is
weak compared to those of western Europe.
   He says the European arrangements have benefits and costs not
yet fully understood.
   ``The system appears to be headed for a significant overhaul as
populations age rapidly in the next 30 years,'' he predicts.
   An overview of the world tax situation was given by Kenneth C.
Messere from the staff of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, the ``rich man's club'' of governments in western
industrialized countries.
   ``Though vertical equity (progressive taxation) has been thrown
out of the tax policy door, it is lurking in some areas of tax
reform _ the idea being not to soak the relatively few rich, but to
protect the many poor,'' he says.
   ``France, Japan and the United States take the view that the
poor should not pay income tax. ... Denmark and Sweden believe all
or nearly all citizenas should contribute ... even if they get more
back in transfer payments than they pay in taxes.''

<HEAD>Hispanic Leaders Hope To Flex Muscle In Shaping Party Platforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hispanic leaders say they are setting aside
their cultural and regional differences this presidential election
year and hope their unity will help them win some clout in shaping
the Democratic and Republican party platforms.
   Former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya said Hispanics representing
various countries of origin couldn't even agree 20 years ago on
what to call themselves.
   ``We've moved beyond that,'' he said Tuesday at the National
Hispanic Leadership Conference. ``It's an evolving process.''
   The conference, which meets during presidential election years
and represents 21 national organizations, drew Hispanic leaders
from across the country to Washington this week to draft a national
agenda.
   ``We've got a good cross-representation of Hispanics from across
the United States,'' said Pablo Sedillo, NHLC chairman.
   ``Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexican-Americans, Central and South
Americans are participating, Democrats and Republicans,
conservatives and liberals. We're proving we can come together and
we are going to make a difference,'' Sedillo said.
   More than 3.5 million Hispanics are expected to vote in
November's general election, according to the group.
   More than 300 delegates attending the conference were set to
vote today on an agenda leaders hope will be included in the
Democratic and GOP platforms.
   ``The issues that are going to be recognized and come out of
this conference will speak very clearly and concretely as to what a
presidential candidate should be doing to represent the needs of
Hispanics _ education, employment, housing, civil rights, health,''
said Sedillo, of Santa Fe, N.M.
   ``We are arriving at a consensus ... that will be very strong,''
Anaya said.
   In its draft agenda, the NHLC calls for steps to stem the high
school dropout rate _ only 50.9 percent of Hispanics complete high
school compared with 77.7 percent of the general population.
   ``If I had to single out any one thing that would be it _ to
keep our youth in school,'' said Al Zapanta of Dallas, director of
government affairs for ARCO Oil and Gas Co.
   ``We have to educate them so they can take their rightful
position in society,'' he added. ``We keep filling the bottom rung,
but they're not moving up.''
   The conference also seeks a one-year extension for undocumented
aliens to apply for amnesty and wants the president to immediately
suspend the deportation of Salvadoran and Nicaraguan nationals from
the United States. And it wants a Hispanic appointed to the Supreme
Court.
   Employment, housing and health are also high on the agenda for
many of the leaders, concerned about the poverty and living
conditions of many Hispanics.
   ``There are places in this country where there is a Third World
situation _ in the (Rio Grande) Valley, northern New Mexico, the
barrios of L.A., the Bronx of New York,'' Sedillo said.
   ``The whole idea is that we as Hispanics want to join in
partnership with the government, with the private sector. It's time
that they recognized the talent and resources we have within our
own community. It's important we add the question of
self-sufficiency. The community wants no handouts _ we want to join
in partnership,'' Sedillo said.

<TEXT>
   The Dover Harbor Board said the nine-week
ferry workers' strike at the English Channel port coupled with a
two-week French seamen's dispute has cost the board $3.8 million in
lost revenue.
   The loss is due to a sharp reduction in passenger, tourist
vehicle and freight traffic and lost ferry berthing fees, said
Jonathan Sloggett, the port's managing director.
   ``We are implementing a number of ways of saving money such as
reducing budgets, canceling non-essential work and not taking on
seasonal staff,'' Sloggett said.
   The 2,300 members of the National Union of Seamen employed by P
and O European Ferries at Dover voted last weekend to continue
their strike over staffing levels. French ferry workers called off
their strike on the Sealink ferry company's Dover to Calais route
over the Easter holiday weekend.

<HEAD>Jackson Complains About Colorado Democrats' Handling Of Caucus
Count</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson,
narrowly outpolled by rival Michael Dukakis in Colorado's caucuses,
is criticizing the state party here for the slow pace of its count
and the party chief's ties to Dukakis.
   The Democratic caucuses were held across Colorado on Monday
night, but significant returns were not reported until Tuesday
afternoon by the state Democratic Party.
   Even before Dukakis pulled out his victory, Jackson accused
state Democratic chairman Buie Seawell of being ``biased and
politically unethical'' and ``deliberately controlling the
process'' by remaining as party chairman after publicly supporting
Dukakis.
   ``The state chairman endorsed Mr. Dukakis,'' Jackson told
reporters in Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday. ``You cannot very well be a
fair referee and coaching another player.''
   He added that the party's ``long and slow count represents a
certain ineptness. ... It heightens suspicions.''
   Seawell countered that ``the Reverend Jackson is just wrong. I
have never known him to just attack for his own political gain, but
that appears to be what this is.''
   He said his staff of six people had worked until 3 a.m. Tuesday
and was back on the job by 8:30 a.m. that day.
   Jackson also contended that Colorado Democrats had changed 30
caucus sites as late as Friday or Saturday without telling his
campaign. ``It comes very close to obstructing justice,'' he said.
   Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, complained about the
Colorado situation Tuesday to Paul Kirk, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.
   DNC spokeswoman Julie Anbender said the committee had contacted
the state party and ``they've assured us that they're doing
everything they can to get the results out.''
   Returns from 77 percent of Colorado's 2,784 precincts showed the
Massachusetts governor leading with 4,029 delegates, or 44.3
percent, to Jackson's 3,528 delegates or 36.5 percent.
   The uncommitted delegates totaled 1,547, or 16.3 percent, and
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. received 236 delegates, or 2.7
percent.
   If the caucus results hold up at Colorado's congressional
district and state Democratic conventions in the next few weeks,
Dukakis would win 20 national convention delegates, while Jackson
would gain 17 and another eight would be uncommitted. Those
calculations are based on returns from 77 percent of the precincts
in the state.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush swept most of
Colorado's 36 GOP delegates to the Republican National Convention,
cornering over 70 percent of the vote in straw polls taken at
caucuses Monday night.
   Actual GOP delegate selection will come at congressional
district conventions and the state convention in June.
   Dukakis and Jackson had hoped to use the Colorado caucuses as a
springboard for Tuesday's Wisconsin Democratic primary.
   Dukakis went on to win that contest, but since there was no
clear Colorado victor when the Wisconsin polls opened Tuesday
morning, it was not thought to have had much of an effect.
   Still, the Dukakis campaign hailed the Colorado win. Bob
Johnson, a spokesman for the campaign in Colorado, said the victory
demonstrates ``that Mike Dukakis can win in any region of the
country.''
   Johnson also said he thought the count was fair. ``To the best
of my knowledge, the party officials conducted the caucuses in a
fair and appropriate manner,'' he said.
   Dukakis himself, commenting on the Colorado contest to reporters
in Boston, said as far as he knew, ``it was run fairly and well.''
   Colorado will send 51 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, with six of them ``super delegates'' who include
Seawell and Gov. Roy Romer, another Dukakis supporter. The Monday
night caucuses began a complicated, four-tier process of selecting
45 of those delegates.

<HEAD>Children With AIDS Run Into Red Tape, Funding Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who try to care for children with AIDS
told a government panel that red tape and a lack of funding make a
painful job even more trying.
   ``These most innocent victims of the AIDS crisis have the right
to live and smile if only for a short time,'' Bronx, N.Y., social
worker Dolores Smithies told the White House AIDS commission on
Tuesday.
   Smithies, who has four children of her own, spends her evenings
raising money to provide care for children with AIDS. Also
appearing before the commission were a Harlem physician who asked
the panel to make it easier for young AIDS victims to receive
Medicaid coverage, and a single Virginia woman having trouble
taking in a second AIDS-stricken child.
   Dr. Elaine Abrams, assistant professor of Clinical Pediatrics at
New York's Harlem Hospital, said her hospital has cared for 37
infants with AIDS even though it gets no money for the care from
public or private sources.
   Abrams told of a 9-year-old child whose mother died of AIDS six
months ago and who now lives with her grandmother.
   The physician said the child does not automatically qualify for
Medicaid just by having the virus, and that to certify her as
having the disease itself would result in her being taken from her
grandmother and placed in line for foster care even though that
would not be in the child's best interest.
   ``Help me get this child on Medicaid so I don't have to sneak
her into the hospital when she needs treatment,'' Abrams said.
``Each child with HIV (AIDS virus) infection needs Medicaid whether
the parent makes a million dollars or zero dollars.''
   Michelle Valentine, the young Virginia woman adopting a baby
girl with AIDS, told the commission she is having trouble getting
permission to take in a second child.
   ``You're single, we can't consider you,'' she said she has been
told.
   Then, in exasperation, she said: ``The typical young yuppie
couple wants one of these kids like they want a hole in the head.''
   Smithies said child placement agencies should rethink the family
criteria they use when placing children with AIDS.
   She cited instances, for example, ``where gay men have been
absolutely extraordinary as care givers.''
   ``We have to expand our vision of what a family is,'' Abrams
added.
   The three women were among 14 witnesses heard by the commission
during the first of four days of hearings this month.

   Federal judicial police arrested nine
people and confiscated 805 pounds of cocaine in the northern border
state of Nuevo Leon.
   Regino Vargas Gonzalez, a local representative of the Federal
Attorney General's Office, said on Tuesday that three of the
arrests were made at a clandestine airstrip 70 miles east of this
state capital.
   ``We have never confiscated so much cocaine in this state,'' he
said of the action, which occurred last week but was not announced
until Tuesday.
   Vargas said the drug gang was planning to send the plane and its
cargo to Houston. One of the nine arrested was a Colombian woman
and a Colombian man still is being sought, he said.
   He said that the rest of the arrests were made in Monterrey and
in the town of Villa de Santiago, 60 miles south of the state
capital.

   Eastern Airlines will appeal an injunction and
contempt citation even though it has dropped plans to sell its
Northeast shuttle to another subsidiary of Texas Air Corp.,
Eastern's president says.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt accepted the
company's report of compliance with an order he issued last month
and said Eastern will no longer be in contempt once it informs
employees it has dropped plans to sell the shuttle.
   On March 10, Pratt had found Eastern in civil contempt of an
earlier injunction issued in a labor dispute with the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   At a brief hearing, Eastern's president, Philip Bakes, said the
financially troubled carrier had abandoned the sale plans.
   Bakes assured the judge that Eastern would comply with the
order. But outside the courtroom, the airline executive reiterated
the company's plan to appeal the contempt citation and the
injunction that bars the shuttle sale.
   Air Shuttle LP, the subsidiary that was to buy the Boston-to-New
York-to-Washington shuttle, withdrew its application with the
Transportation Department to complete the $225 million sale, Bakes
said.
   Pratt ruled that the proposed sale violated a 1987 injunction
that required Eastern to maintain current working conditions. That
injunction prohibited Eastern from transferring ground crews to
another subsidiary.
   The IAM contended that the proposed transactions were intended
to undermine the union.
   Bakes told the judge the company acted on advice of its lawyers
and ``never believed ... we were violating an order of the court.''

   With Michael Dukakis again holding the upper
hand, the Democratic presidential candidates descended full force
on New York today for a two-week run to the crucial April 19
primary.
   Dukakis picked up back-to-back wins in Colorado and Wisconsin
this week over Jesse Jackson, to follow up on home turf victory in
Connecticut. Before that, Jackson had piled up victories in
Michigan and Illinois.
   Even before the polls closed in Tuesday's Wiscnsin contest,
Dukakis and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. were prospecting in New
York, hoping to stake a claim on the mother lode of the primary
season thus far.
   ``I hope it's a sign of things to come,'' Dukakis of his
Wisconsin win.
   Jackson, too, was upbeat abut his prospects.
   ``We go to New York with a good campaign, a broad-based
campaign, momentum, a clear messge _ a message that applies to New
York,'' he said Tuesday night.
   At stake in the New York primary are 255 delegates. At the
national convention, only California's delegation, a 336-member
giant, will be larger. And that primary isn't until June 7.
   ``We think that if we can win New York, we're going to be in a
good position to dominate the last third of the primaries,'' said
Paul Bograd, Dukakis' New York campaign manager. ``But New York
will be critical to that.''
   ``No way you can underestimate the importance of this one,''
said John Marino, executive director of the state Democratic
Committee and a political operative of Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Cuomo's presence is felt in the New York primary race, as it has
been to some extent in the entire campaign. Reluctant to run for
president himself, Cuomo has been equally reluctant to endorse any
other Democrat.
   Cuomo's apparent indecision has fueled speculation for months
that he might want a deadlocked convention and desperate Democrats
turning to him offering the nomination. Cuomo has insisted he
doesn't want that, but thus far has refused to rule out accepting a
convention draft.
   There is also a Republican primary on April 19 in New York, with
102 delegates at stake. But it is little more than a formality as
Vice President George Bush rolls toward the GOP nomination.
   On the other hand, the Democratic primary could provide
important answers, including:
   _Can Dukakis keep up the momentum he's regained with this week's
victories in Wisconsin and Colorado _ and convince party leaders
that he deserves the nomination?
   _Can Jackson's solid support among minority voters and the
backing of several prominent New York labor leaders overcome Jewish
uneasiness and produce the New York victory his campaign now needs?
   _Will Gore's decision to put most of his remaining eggs in the
New York basket prove to be anything more than a windfall for
television stations who run his paid ads?
   Along with Cuomo, most of the state's other major Democrats,
such as New York City Mayor Edward Koch and Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, have remained officially neutral.
   Recent polls among New York Democrats have Dukakis leading the
field with support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent, depending
on the poll. Jackson has been consistently second at just under 30
percent while Gore and Simon have yet to crack double digits in any
of the polls.
   Anticipating Dukakis' victory in Wisconsin, Bograd declared
Tuesday evening that the campaign had become ``clearly a two-man
race'' between Dukakis and Jackson.
   While the Dukakis camp was ready to write off Gore, who finished
a distant third in Wisconsin, the Tennessee senator has been
campaigning hard here for more than a week. He's also hired New
York political consultant David Garth, who runs Koch's campaigns
and who occasionally advises Cuomo.
   Gore has been courting New York's politically important Jewish
community, and has been attacking Jackson and Dukakis on the issue
of support for Israel.
   If that message has any impact it could hurt Dukakis most;
Jackson's support among New York Jews is already minimal following
his 1984 ``Hymietown'' gaffe. However, Dukakis' wife Kitty, who is
Jewish, has been campaigning in the Jewish community.
   Jackson is relying on his strong minority support, coupled with
a growing acceptance among white voters, to win more than the 26
percent he garnered in the New York primary four years ago.
   Jackson plans a big television buy in New York, a tool he hasn't
used much in other states. He also has the support of influential
labor leaders such as Stanley Hill, executive director of the
120,000-member New York City municipal workers union, and Jan
Pierce, a top official with the Communications Workers of America.
   Bograd, Dukakis' New York campaign manager, says the
Massachusetts governor will spend at least $1 million on his New
York effort; others put it as high as $3 million. The Massachusetts
governor also has the support of some of the top officials from the
state's politically powerful teachers' unions.

   Child abuse claimed an average of three lives
a day in the United States last year, according to statistics
supplied by the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse.
   There were about 2.25 million reports of child abuse and neglect
nationwide last year, the committee said, projecting that 1,132 of
the children died of their injuries, slightly fewer than the 1,181
reported in 1986.
   ``The public outcry at the tragic death of Lisa Steinberg should
have been repeated a thousand times over last year,'' Anne Cohn,
executive director of the group, said Tuesday.
   Cohn was referring to the widely publicized beating death last
year of 6-year-old Elizabeth Steinberg in New York, which last year
led the nation with 166 reported abuse deaths. That was double the
total for California, which was second.
   The group also surveyed 1,250 people nationwide and found
widespread support for more intensive investigation of all child
abuse reports even as some states are screening their reports more
carefully.
   The survey showed 67 percent of the people questioned believe
``public child welfare agencies should investigate all reports of
child abuse regardless of the seriousness of the charge.''
   The group said differences in screening and reporting methods
may have been responsible for wide swings among states from the
previous year in reported child abuse cases.
   Illinois reported 30 percent more cases last year and Kansas 25
percent more to register the biggest increases, NCPCA said in a
survey of states.
   New Mexico, Hawaii and Louisiana showed declines of more than 20
percent.
   The survey of states showed 25 states and the District of
Columbia reporting increases over 1986, including 10 states that
showed jumps of more than 10 percent in reports of child abuse.
   The survey of people's opinions on child abuse was conducted for
NCPCA by the New York polling firm of Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas
Inc. Results had a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
   In the separate state survey, figures for six states were not
available and four others said some deaths were still being
investigated.

   Francis A. Keating II, selected for the No. 3
job at the Justice Department, is a former FBI agent who has spent
much of his time in the Reagan administration going after big banks
who launder money for drug smugglers and other criminals.
   Keating, assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement, pursued
various cases against banks for neglecting, either intentionally or
inadvertently, a 17-year-old law requiring that the institutions to
inform the government in writing whenever they handle a cash
transaction of $10,000 or more.
   The Treasury crackdown assessed multimillion-dollar penalties
against some of the nation's biggest banks, including a record
$4.75 million fine paid by the Bank of America.
   The crackdown on money laundering was started by Keating's
predecessor in the job, John M. Walker Jr., who is now a federal
judge in New York, but Keating continued the effort when he took
over at the Treasury Department in December 1985.
   As head of enforcement, Keating, 44, oversees the Secret
Service, the Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   Keating was one of the officials charged with implementing the
administration's stepped-up efforts at halting the flow of illegal
drugs into the country.
   Keating, who will replace Associate Attorney General Stephen
Trott, was praised by Attorney General Edwin Meese III as someone
who ``can hit the ground running'' in the Justice Department's work
in combating illegal drugs.
   Trott is leaving Washington to become a federal appeals court
judge in California.
   At Treasury, Keating also has headed the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, the agency charged with implementing economic
sanctions imposed against Cuba, Libya, Iran and South Africa.
   Before joining the administration, Keating was a partner in an
Oklahoma law firm. He also served as a U.S. attorney from 1981 to
1983 for the Northern District of Oklahoma.
   From 1972 to 1981, Keating was a member of the Oklahoma
legislature, starting out in the House of Representatives and then
winning a seat in the state Senate, where he served as Republican
leader.
   Keating is also a former state prosecutor and FBI agent.
   He graduated from Georgetown University in Washington in 1966
and received his law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1969.

<TEXT>
   In turning to John Shepherd, a former American
Bar Association president, to fill the No. 2 position at the
Justice Department, Attorney General Edwin Meese III has found a
strong conservative ally.
   Shepherd, a 62-year-old St. Louis attorney, wrote a 3,400-word
article last September for the National Law Journal supporting
President Reagan's nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme
Court and attacking Bork's critics.
   On the eve of hearings into the nomination, later rejected by
the Senate, Shepherd said Bork's philosophy that courts should
restrain themselves in interpreting the Constitution ``is
synonymous with judicial integrity.''
   ``Far from being an unprincipled activist, Judge Bork is a
highly principled jurist well within the jurisprudential
mainstream,'' Shepherd wrote.
   But prior to serving as the president of the 340,000-member ABA
in 1984 and 1985, Shepherd was well known to conservative activists
in key policy roles in the Reagan administration.
   In 1977 he first came to the attention of California
conservatives then behind the effort to get Ronald Reagan elected
president in 1980.
   While representing the Hoover Institute associated with Stanford
University in a case then, Shepherd met most of the officers of the
conservative think tank that provided much of the philosophic
underpinning for the so-called Reagan revolution. Within a year,
Shepherd was named an overseer of the institute.
   Shepherd started his practice after getting a law degree from
St. Louis University in 1951 representing personal injury victims
in liability suits, often on a contingency fee basis getting paid a
percentage of any settlement or damages awarded.
   As the Bar Association's president, he vigorously defended that
practice against assaults by the medical community in response to
mounting malpractice claims and other defendants in liability suits.
   Contingency fees are a ``no-cure, no-pay system that is the key
to the courthouse for many, many citizens,'' he said. ``Jurors have
to understand that Marcus Welby is not our system of medical care.''
   However, Shepherd also recognized that lawyers also have an
image problem. He released during his tenure as the ABA's president
a five-year study concluding that attorneys could reduce their
clients' legal costs by 75 percent through better management.
   ``We must move in that direction,'' he said.
   During that time his law practice also prospered. Setting up his
own firm _ Shepherd, Sandberg & Phoenix _ in St. Louis in 1980,
Shepherd evolved from a plaintiff's attorney to a defense lawyer in
liability cases.
   His firm's clients now include some of the nation's corporate
giants, among them the Monsanto Co., General Dynamics and Ford
Motor Co.
   A former bookkeeper from Shepherd's law firm who claimed she had
an affair with Shepherd went on trial in St. Louis Circuit Court
last month and was convicted of stealing more than $147,000 from
the firm.
   Denise Sinner, who was fired in February 1987, was accused of
writing checks to herself from the law firm's accounts and admitted
using the money to pay bills and buy luxury items.
   She claimed Shepherd had told her to write checks to herself.
But Shepherd denied that he had had an affair with her or that he
had authorized her to write the checks.
   Sinner, 29, also was convicted of making a false statement to
the government. She had claimed that a doctor had diagnosed her as
having terminal cancer.

   Local officials are rolling up the
welcome mat to show their distaste for actress Jane Fonda when the
former anti-war activist comes to this mill town to film a movie
this summer.
   The board of aldermen, backing a local veterans' group, voted
10-3 Tuesday to not welcome Fonda because of her visit to Hanoi
during the Vietnam War.
   ``A traitor is not welcome anywhere in this country,'' said Bud
Gagnon, director of the Chicopee Veterans' Services. ``She went to
Hanoi. She's a traitor. She did it while our POWs were there.''
   The aldermen did not comment on the symbolic gesture at a
meeting attended by a small group of veterans.
   The resolution states that ``Jane Fonda should not receive any
official recognition and-or that courtesy should not be extended to
Jane Fonda prior to or during the filming of the movie `Union
Street.'''
   Stephen Rivers, a spokesman for Fonda, called the vote
``unfortunate but irrelevant.'' He said the board bowed to
complaints from a few veterans, most of whom did not serve in
Vietnam.

   Jesse Jackson's clout was demonstrated in defeat of a charter
amendment in Cleveland, while in Columbia, Mo., Mayor Rodney Smith
survived a recall election that resulted from a controversy with
racial overtones.
   Wisconsin state Sen. John Norquist swept to victory over former
acting Gov. Martin Schreiber in the non-partisan race to succeed
Maier, who is retiring at age 70 after holding the office since
1960.
   ``Together we built a grass-roots volunteer organization like
Milwaukee has never seen,'' Norquist told cheering backers at his
victory party. ``Together we delivered a message of hope ... and a
message of real change. And together we will make this message a
reality in Milwaukee.''
   Complete, unofficial returns from all 324 precincts showed the
38-year-old Norquist with 112,902 votes, or 54 percent, and
Schreiber with 93,738 votes, or 45 percent.
   Roughly 26 percent of Cleveland's registered voters turned out
for the charter referendum. Unofficial returns showed 46,854 votes
against the measure, or 65 percent, to 25,458 in favor, or 35
percent.
   Jackson, the Democratic presidential contender, lent his support
to opponents of the amendment to limit the city council president
to two one-year terms.
   The ballot issue was viewed by many as an attack on City Council
President George Forbes, who has led the council for 15 years and
is the city's highest black elected official.
   The Coalition for Ordinance Reforming Council's Efficiency,
known as C-Force, led a petition drive to get the amendment on the
ballot. C-Force leaders, including blacks, contend Forbes has
intimidated council members by withholding federal money for ward
projects and stalling legislation.
   Jackson's picture was used on literature against the amendment
and a radio advertisement featured Jackson urging voters to defeat
the charter amendment.
   Jackson recorded an audio tape in which he claims that Tuesday's
special election on the amendment is an attempt ``to take away what
we have gained across the years _ a share of power in Cleveland and
across the nation,'' said Gerald J. Austin, Jackson's national
campaign manager.
   Columbia mayor Smith, a 59-year-old self-employed tree surgeon
elected as a write-in candidate in 1986, faced a recall election
because of controversy over remarks he made last October at a
meeting with local blacks angry over the forced resignation of
Police Chief Bill Dye, a black.
   The mayor, who is white, told a predominantly black crowd that
if they didn't like Columbia they ought to leave.
   ``In the annals of black history, we are always told to move and
give up our rights,'' said Betty Roberts, a leader of the Coalition
of Concerned Citizens, which organized the recall drive.
   Final returns showed 2,493 voters, or 22 percent, favored
recalling the self-employed tree surgeon while 9,041 voters, or 78
percent, wanted him to remain in office.
   Five candidates were running for mayor in Tulsa, where a number
of other local offices were being decided.
   Final unofficial returns showed state Sen. Rodger Randle, a
Democrat, had 45,517 votes, or 55.3 percent, to Republican
incumbent Dick Crawford's 28,142 votes, or 34.2 percent.
   In Kenosha, Wis., a city rocked by Chrysler Corp.'s announced
closing of an auto plant, incumbent Mayor Eugene Dorff lost a bid
to win his first full term. With 33 of 34 precincts reporting,
unofficial returns showed Alderman Pat Moran with 12,329 votes to
10,130 for Dorff.
   In Milwaukee, support in the black community became a heated
campaign issue. When black businessman Lee Holloway, who finished
third in the Feb. 16 primary, held a rally to endorse a candidate
while paying off remaining campaign debts, Norquist boycotted the
event and its $20 admission fee. Schreiber attended and won the
endorsement.
   Norquist was elected to the state Assembly in 1974 and served
there until being elected in 1982 to the Senate, where he was
assistant majority leader.
   Schreiber, a lawyer, served in the state Senate from 1962 until
being elected lieutenant governor in 1970, then was acting governor
after Gov. Patrick J. Lucey resigned to become U.S. ambassador to
Mexico in 1977.
   Schreiber lost to Republican Lee S. Dreyfus in the 1978 election
for governor. He lost again when he tried for the Democratic
nomination for governor in 1982 and has worked at jobs in the
private sector.

<TEXT>
   New York real-estate magnate Donald Trump says
he agreed to pay a $750,000 civil penalty stemming from his
attempted takeover of two companies in order to avoid a long, drawn
out legal battle with the government.
   The payment settles a suit filed by the Federal Trade Commission
over his 1986 stock purchases in Holiday Corp. and Bally
Manufacturing Corp.
   Both cases involved the purchase of stock options through Bear,
Stearns & Co., which, in turn, bought actual shares. The FTC
contends the exercise of stock options was covered by rules
requiring that buyers notify the government before purchasing more
than $15 million worth of voting stock in a company and wait 30
days before completing the transaction.
   Trump said Tuesday he was advised by his lawyers and the
investment firm that stock options were exempt and he should be
reimbursed by Bear, Stearns. A Bear, Stearns spokeswoman had no
immediate comment.

   New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato denies calling
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
``cowards'' for not doing more to oust Panamanian strongman Manuel

   ``My recollection of the conversation was that (I said) the

   Carlucci made the allegations in a letter to D'Amato that
followed a telephone conversation the two had last week. After

Department spokesman Col. Arnold Williams said, ``I think the
letter probably speaks for itself.''
   In the phone call, D'Amato had complained that the defense

not send a senior military officer to Panama to tell Noriega to
leave, said Jack Kinnicutt, a spokesman for D'Amato.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Dukakis Steps Out of The Crowd, Heads for NY</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis says he doesn't expect to land
any knockout blows in the Democratic presidential nomination fight,
but his Wisconsin landslide makes him the man to beat in New York
on April 19 _ and at the party's nominating convention in July.
   No matter what the self-styled Democratic convention power
brokers say.
   And it may mean that Jesse Jackson, the biggest surprise of the
year, has peaked halfway through the primary and caucus season.
   In another time, a solid Democratic regular like Dukakis
carrying blue-collar Wisconsin might not seem like much. But by the
reckoning in use for the unpredictable 1988 campaign, Dukakis
scored several important successes in a single Tuesday night:
   _ He won a state he had to win, by more than anyone expected,
and at the moment of Jesse Jackson's greatest momentum. In any
other year, Jackson's showing would have been spectacular. But this
week, basking in the glow of his stunning Michigan caucus victory,
pictured on the cover of Time and Newsweek, drawing boisterous
crowds from one town to the next, he could not match the
expectations that had been set for him.
   _ Dukakis probably succceeded in winnowing the field as well,
with Sen. Paul Simon expected to suspend active campaigning later
this week. That will mean one less white candidate to siphon off
white votes in future primaries in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio,
where Jackson's black constituency is substantially larger than it
was in Wisconsin.
   _ He benefited from Sen. Albert Gore's failure to emerge as a
strong challenger in the race. Gore was gaining less than 20
percent of the vote, far behind Jackson, and now has failed utterly
in a month-long bid to turn his Super Tuesday victories into
success outside the South. Already, Dukakis' aides are trying to
undermine Gore's campaign in New York, raising questions about the
large loans he is relying on.
   _ Dukakis' victory should reassure the party leaders who were
beginning to wonder if a son of New England would ever be able to
carry one of the Great Lakes industrial states. That, in turn,
should put a damper on the incessant talk of drafting Mario Cuomo
into the Democratic race _ and increase the odds that Cuomo will
lend his support.
   And along the same lines, Dukakis has been working the phones,
hoping a victory in Wisconsin might set off a movement of party
leaders, members of Congress and governors to his side. Not so much
because they are enamored of him _ they are not _ but because he is
their best chance to stop Jackson, who they fear would lead the
party to the defeat of a lifetime if he won the nomination and led
the ticket against George Bush this fall.
   None of this is to say that Dukakis is now the inevitable
nominee. He tried to portray himself that way a few weeks ago, and
it almost made him the inevitable governor of Massachusetts through
the end of his term in 1990. He campaigned lackadaisically,
seemingly worried more about collecting endorsements than votes _
and finished third in Illinois before being buried under Jackson's
landslide in Michigan.
   And in a year in which Gary Hart dropped out of the race twice,
in which the much-sought after Iowa caucus prize proved worth
little to winner Richard Gephardt and in which Jackson has broken
new ground, Dukakis may yet have to fend off a charge or two before
the nomination can be his.
   Still, Dukakis demonstrated not only that he could win this
week, but that he could do so on his own terms.
   Under pressure from party officials to do something _ anything _
to regroup and stop Jackson, he gambled that he could do so without
assaulting him and driving away the black votes so essential to a
general election victory.
   When he offered criticism, he did cautiously, as when he said it
was a ``bad idea'' for his rival to become involved in Panama _ but
then quickly added that Jackson had issued a clarification of his
own position.
   Instead, he attacked the Reagan administration sharply in
speeches and in a new television commercial that evoked images of
human suffering in the era of Ronald Reagan.
   ``This administration has walked away from the American dream.
They've walked away from the basic contract that says if you work
hard and pay your taxes and live within the law, you have a right
to a good job; and the right to a life where you don't have to go
to bed every night worried about whether that job will still be
there in the morning,'' he said in a Milwaukee speech.
   More than that, he allowed his staff to schedule him into more
informal settings, serving lunch to senior citizens at one stop and
visiting children in a hospital in another.

   A woman fatally shot her husband and
three of their children, then waited a day before killing herself,
because she feared financial problems would break up her family,
police said.
   ``She asked that she be forgiven for her sins,'' said Valencia
County Undersheriff Bill Roach, quoting from one of two notes left
by Jacqueline Fuson.
   The bodies of Mrs. Fuson, 38, her husband, Thomas A. Fuson, 45;
Johnny R. Fuson, 18; Mamie Jolene Fuson, 12, and Amanda Fuson, 10,
were discovered Tuesday at their home in this rural community 25
miles south of Albuquerque.
   Roach said one note was brief and dealt with what should be done
with the family's pet dog and property. The second, much more
detailed, was addressed to her surviving son, Charlie, who lives in
Alamogordo.
   A neighbor found Mrs. Fuson's body outside the front door of the
home and notified police. Inside the modest pink stucco house
police found the bodies of her husband and three children in
separate bedrooms.
   Thomas Fuson had been shot twice in the chest and once in the
head. The children each had been been shot once in the head. All
were killed as they slept, probably Sunday night, police said.
   Mrs. Fuson was shot once in the chest and a .22-caliber revolver
was found in her lap. She apparently killed her husband and the
children Sunday night, and fatally shot herself either Monday night
or Tuesday morning, Roach said.
   Mrs. Fuson ``apparently had stayed in the house with the
victims'' from the time they died until she shot herself, Roach
said. ``Evidently no one heard the shots.''
   Capt. Ray Flores of the sheriff's department said Mrs. Fuson's
note to her son Charlie talked about the problems the family had
endured.
   ``She said the family was having a tremendous financial
burden,'' Flores said. ``She said the father required an operation
and the family didn't have the money to pay for it.''
   ``She said the family had been so close and that she loved her
children so much that she could not live and see them apart,''
Flores said. ``She said she was tired of having to live this way
and she could see no other alternative.''
   According to Roach, one of the notes said the family ``would
meet later and be together and wouldn't suffer any more.''
   The Fusons, who had been married about 22 years, moved here
about two years ago from Carlsbad, said Mrs. Fuson's sister,
Patricia Jones. Roach said Thomas Fuson, a plumber, needed a hernia
operation and had been laid off several times recently.
   Ms. Jones, of Moriarty, said she and her sister had frequently
corresponded, but there was no indication of family problems.
``Financial problems, yes, but that wasn't news,'' Ms. Jones said.
   The bodies were sent to the office of the medical investigator
in Albuquerque for autopsies.
   Outside the family home Tuesday, neighbors comforted Charlie
Fuson, who refused to be interviewed.
   Jeff Sullivan, principal of Dennis Chavez Elementary School
where Mamie Jolene was a sixth-grader and Amanda was a
fifth-grader, spent much of Tuesday counseling the children's
classmates about the deaths.
   ``They were very happy, wonderful kids,'' Sullivan said of the
sisters.

   C. Shelby Coffey III has been named executive
editor of the Los Angeles Times in a promotion that puts him in
line to succeed Editor William F. Thomas, who is to retire next
year, Publisher Tom Johnson says.
   Coffey, 41, deputy associate editor of the Times, assumes his
new post next Monday and will report to Thomas during the
transition, Johnson said.
   Coffey will have responsibility for all news departments except
the editorial pages, which will continue to report to Thomas.
   ``Bill Thomas will retire in 1989, after 18 splendid years as
editor. This announcement is being made now to provide for an
orderly transition,'' Johnson said Monday.
   Coffey joined The Washington Post in 1968 as a sports writer and
subsequently became editor of the Post's magazine, editor of its
Style section, deputy managing editor and assistant managing editor
for national news.
   He became editor of U.S. News & World Report in 1985 and editor
of the Dallas Times Herald in 1986, before joining the Times that
year.

<HEAD>Parachutist Death Accidental, Investigators Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISBURG, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tired parachutist's fatigue and his
preocance says.
   The death Saturday of Ivan Lester McGuire was accidental,
although ``a man who has jumped 800 times ought to remember his
parachute,'' Franklin County Sheriff's Capt. Ralph Brown said
Tuesday.
   There are no indications of foul play or suicide, and blood
tests indicating whether drugs or alcohol were present in his
system should be available next week, Brown said.
   McGuire, 35, was carrying a video camera mounted on his helmet
and was filming an instructor and a student at Franklin County
Sports Parachute Center. The videotape was mangled in the crash,
but salvaged by investigators.
   The videotape showed that McGuire jumped from the airplane and
the jump was going smoothly until the parachutes worn by the
instructor and the student deployed and McGuire hurtled below them.
   ``It kind of appears he reached for his parachute and didn't
have one,'' Brown said. ``You could only see the instructor and the
student falling on the video. But the release for his parachute is
on his right hip, and when that right hand goes down, the left hand
comes forward and it comes into camera view.
   ``Then the pictures get to moving real fast because he's
approaching the ground at 150 mph. The only thing the camera shows
is the ground coming.''
   McGuire's body, found in woods about 1{ miles from the airfield.
   Mark Luman of Louisburg, the pilot of the plane, could not be
found for comment and had no telephone listing, but Brown said the
pilot ``wasn't in any position to see what happened in the back of
the plane.''
   There was no answer at the parachute center Tuesday.
   Nancy Fayard, wife of parachute center owner Paul Fayard, was
quoted in Tuesday's News and Observer of Raleigh as saying, ``No
one was aware that he got on the plane without a parachute. Of
course no one knew or they would have stopped him.''
   Although an expert jumper, McGuire could have forgotten to put
on his parachute because of fatigue or preoccupation with his video
equipment, she said.
   Mrs. Fayard said McGuire worked the third shift at Northern
Telecom Inc., a manufacturer of telephone switching equipment, and
usually left the club at noon to get to work. On Saturday, she
said, he stayed until 2:30 p.m. to shoot the video.
   ``He's a real perfectionist when it comes to his video
photography and he'd been working a lot on it,'' she said. ``The
best we can figure is he became so preoccupied with the video, and
then being fatigued, that his mind was on the video.''

<HEAD>Former Siamese Twins Going Home To West Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Benjamin and Patrick Binder, who spent their
first seven months joined at the head, are seriously underdeveloped
but have the potential to lead normal lives, said doctors preparing
to release the babies from the hospital.
   The separated Siamese twins, now 14 months old, will return to
Germany in the next few days, physicians at Johns Hopkins Hospital
said Tuesday. Benjamin should begin crawling soon and will go home
to Ulm, West Germany, with his parents. Patrick will go to a German
hospital for observation.
   ``There is no reason for us to think they will not continue to
improve,'' said Dr. Ben Carson, a member of the medical team that
has treated the infants since they were admitted in August.
   ``They have made very substantial progress in the past few
months and ... we're very hopeful the potential will culminate in
normal existence,'' Carson said at a news conference.
   However, Dr. Mark Rogers stressed that the boys are not now
normal. Their development is equivalent to that of 2-to-5-month-old
babies.
   Carson said he was unwilling to project the mental and physical
level the boys will reach, but when the twins return here for
evaluation next year, doctors will be able to predict fairly
accurately the boys' future development.
   The twins have had several setbacks since they were separated in
a 22-hour operation during the Labor Day weekend by a 70-member
medical team. In October, their temperatures rose inexplicably for
several days. The latest occurred March 13 when Patrick choked on
formula fed to him through a nasal tube.
   Rogers said it's unknown if the incident will have long-term
effects, although Patrick had reached the point of turning over
before the incident and has not returned to that level.
   Benjamin is at about the level as when he entered the hospital
and is expected to begin crawling soon, the doctors said.
   Because they were joined at the head, the twins were not
normally developed when they arrived. The trauma of the operation
and long hospital stay account at least partially for the
developmental lag, Carson said.
   At the time of the separation operation, doctors had given it a
50-50 chance of success.
   ``Certainly in terms of a medical or technical feat, it has
clearly been successful,'' Carson said.
   He said there were 48 cases in medical history of Siamese twins
joined at the head. This was the first separation where both twins
lived. Their kind of joining _ at the back of the head with a
shared vein _ was the rarest, he said.
   In February, doctors implanted titanium mesh plates in the
opening at the back of their heads, created by the separation of
their joined skulls and a shared vein.
   Benjamin has a bald spot on the back of his head from the
operation, `but if he grows his hair long he can comb it down,''
said Dr. Craig Dufresne. Patrick has a full head of hair.
   The twins' parents have refused to speak with reporters here.
Before the separation at Hopkins they sold their story to a West
German magazine.
   Their mother, Theresia Parlagi Binder, has been at the hospital
with the boys and has taken Benjamin outside in a carriage, doctors
said Tuesday.
   Rogers said the doctors donated all their time and care and
Hopkins treated the boys at no cost except for a small portion of
the about $800,000 expense covered by German government insurance.

   Despite police declarations of war on
cheap, potent crack cocaine, drug turf wars are transforming the
city's low-income housing projects into twilight zones of violence,
death and terror.
   ``Families are selling (crack), families are using,'' said
Charlotte Tillman, director of the Bayview-Hunters Point Foundation
Youth Drug counseling. ``It's a way of life _ survival in the
projects.''
   Her program has 36 clients, a waiting list of 18 and has to turn
away referrals. Tillman, a social worker for 23 years, said the
crack situation is the worst she's ever seen _ and there's no end
in sight.
   ``We're losing a generation of young people,'' Tillman said.
``In one night you can make at least $400 off one person buying all
night. (On) heroin you nod out after a couple hundred dollars'
(worth of the drug). On crack you go on for days or as long as your
heart can stand it.''
   Crack, a rock-like, smokeable form of cocaine that goes for as
little as $5 for a whitish pebble, is intensely addictive and
potentially deadly to users, dealers and anyone crossing their
paths.
   On Jan. 22, Daniel Foster visited his old Hunters Point
neighborhood, stepping off a bus just after midnight into a crowd
of men and women, many high on crack.
   ``They asked him if he was a cop,'' said police Inspector Earl
Sanders. ``He told them, `No,' and kept walking. Then they asked
him if he was from Sunnydale (turf of a rival gang), but when he
said, `No,' someone in the crowd said he was lying. Then they began
to chase him.''
   Police said someone fired a pistol at least four times, hitting
Foster once in the back. He died less than an hour later.
   On Jan. 29, police broke up a battle between two competing gangs
in a Mission District housing project. There were 32 shots fired
from weapons such as an M-16 rifle, 12-gauge shotgun and handguns.
   On Jan. 17, a 13-year-old retarded boy in the Potrero Annex
housing project three blocks from Mayor Art Agnos' home was fatally
shot by police, already tense from gang violence, who mistook his
toy gun for a real one.
   Since last fall, when the city set up a crack cocaine task force
of police, the state Justice Department and U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, officers have made 5,506 arrests for drug sales and
possession.
   They have seized more than 400 pounds of cocaine, $2.7 million
in cash and 302 guns, said police Lt. Jim Molinari.
   ``We do put organizations out of business ... but somebody else
always seems to pick up the banner and carry along. I think we're
failing, quite frankly,'' said Jerry Smith of the California Bureau
of Narcotics Enforcement.
   The city has 47 projects with 6,800 units and 17,000 residents,
but its security force merged with city police five years ago
because of budget constraints. During the past year, the city has
doubled its narcotics officers to 157 and the state recently
assigned 18 more narcotics agents to the region.
   Betty Brooks, a 20-year resident of Potrero Annex and a San
Francisco Housing Authority commissioner, said residents live in
constant fear.
   ``Everyone in the area has been victimized by the shootings, the
rash of burglaries,'' she said. ``No one has gone untouched in some
manner. I mean, you have to get to your car, to the bus stop.''
   The Rand Corp. ranks San Francisco No. 5 nationally among major
cities in cocaine-related hospital admissions, with 2.90 for every
1,000.
   At San Francisco General, Dr. Don Wong said that like other
metropolitan public hospitals, 1 in 10 of the approximately 200
infants born there each month are addicted because of maternal drug
use.
   The city has 11 foster homes to care for 17 ``medically
fragile'' infants suffering from drug, alcohol or other medical
problems. There are two or three newborns always on the waiting
list, said spokesman Jan Esbaugh.
   ``Practically all drug-addicted babies we are now seeing ... are
at least in part cocaine babies,'' he said.

   The opposition newspaper La Prensa,
which reopened six months ago after a government-ordered shutdown,
said it will cease publishing indefinitely today because the
Sandinistas have withheld newsprint.
   The leftist government, which controls the purchase and sale of
newsprint in Nicaragua, said its supply was exhausted and claimed
it had warned newspapers to conserve paper until a new shipment
arrives later this month.
   ``La Prensa suspends publication,'' said the banner headline in
Tuesday's editions of the afternoon newspaper. ``Future undecided
because of state control of paper,'' read another headline.
   ``We don't have paper to publish tomorrow or on the following
days because the government alleges that there isn't any paper in
the country, but we know there is,'' said Cristiana Chamorro,
assistant director of La Prensa.
   The Ministry of Industry said in a statement in Tuesday morning
papers that it didn't have newsprint because a shipment scheduled
for March has been delayed. It said a shipment was expected by
April 17. ``Once this shipment is received, the Ministry of
Industry will proceed to distribute paper proportionally according
to the established mechanisms,'' it said.
   The ministry said it told La Prensa and two other newspapers, El
Nuevo Diario and Barricada, that ``the contraction of paper for the
year had suffered delays and that all possible efforts were being
made to assure the first shipment during the month of May.''
   It said the government had urged the papers to take precautions
against using up their stockpiles before the end of that month. The
pro-government Barricada said it, too, was running low on paper,
but planned to publish today.
   Miss Chamorro said La Prensa was told to hold on until March,
not the end of May. She said the paper shortage marks the first
time La Prensa has been forced to interrupt service because of the
government since it was allowed to reopen Oct. 1, 1987 after a
15-month shutdown. The paper was allowed to reopen under the terms
of a regional peace plan signed by the Sandinistas.
   La Prensa said the paper shortage ``could be avoided if we were
permitted to handle imports ourselves.''
   The government, saying La Prensa was promoting U.S. aggression
in this war-torn country, forced the newspaper to cease operations
June 26, 1986.
   ``La Prensa, acting as a voice for the interests of a powerful
aggressor, has been elevating its levels of provocation (and)
disinformation, through trying to justify North American
aggression,'' the government said at the time.
   The newspaper, whose mottos are ``Serving truth and justice''
and ``Without press liberty, there is no liberty,'' has been a
vocal opponent of the Sandinista regime and has suffered censorship
and shutdowns many times before.
   Its directors say the Sandinistas betrayed the country after the
1979 revolution that toppled the rightist regime of the late
Anastasio Somoza.
   ``Nicaragua is at war because the Marxist-Leninist government
betrayed the Nicaraguan people by deviating from the original idea
of the revolution,'' Violeta Chamorro, La Prensa co-owner, said
after the 1986 shutdown.
   Her son, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, lives in Miami and is a leader
of the Contra rebels who with U.S. aid have been trying for more
than six years to oust the Sandinistas.
   La Prensa, founded March 2, 1926, is Nicaragua's oldest
newspaper. It suffered censorship, repression and shutdowns during
the Somoza regime, too.
   Violeta Chamorro is the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, La
Prensa's former director who was slain in 1977. The newspaper
offices were destroyed in the revolution and La Prensa was rebuilt
only to suffer a major ideological division among its editors
shortly afterward.
   About 80 percent of the staff, including Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro's brother, Xavier, left to establish the newspaper El
Nuevo Diario.
   Cristiana Chamorro, daughter of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, said La
Prensa didn't circulate during Holy Week because of a shortage of
newsprint.
   ``What's strange about the case is that the newspapers Barricada
and El Nuevo Diario have published as normal,'' she said.
   Barricada, the official voice of the National Sandinista
Liberation Front, and El Nuevo Diario, the pro-government
newspaper, didn't publish for four days over the Easter holidays,
as is customary in Nicaragua.
   A secretary for Barricada director Carlos Fernando Chamorro said
the newspaper also is running short of paper, but plans to publish
today. She spoke on condition of anonymity. Barracada has loaned
newsprint to La Prensa before.

<TEXT>
   Military leaders for the Sandinista
government and the Contra rebels have renewed cease-fire
negotiations to hammer out key details for an agreement to end a
grueling war now in its seventh year.
   Little progress was reported Tuesday during 2{ hours of talks in
this remote outpost near the Costa Rican border.
   Both sides accused the other of misinterpreting a peace plan
signed two weeks ago and of violating a truce that started March 21.
   The only positive aspect of Tuesday's meeting was an agreement
to continue the talks until the mechanics of the cease-fire can be
worked out.
   The discussions were resuming today.
   Hopes for the peace agreement signed March 23 started to fade
over the weekend when the U.S.-backed Contras postponed a meeting
scheduled for today in the capital of Managua between high-ranking
government and rebel officials.
   The Sandinistas argued that the meeting should be held because
it was set out in the peace agreement.
   In putting off the talks, the Contras cited, among other things,
the lack of progress in the technical meetings held last week.
   The talks Tuesday and today were held to define zones in which
the rebels are to gather, outline security measures and detail how
supplies will be delivered during the 60-day cease-fire, which
formally started on Friday.
   Aristides Sanchez, a director of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the
Contra umbrella group, said the main concern is to ``guarantee the
physical security and morale of the Contras.'' He described the
talks as ``extremely delicate.''
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said the rebel delegation
accused the Sandinista troops of systematically violating the
truce, which was agreed on March 21 at the start of the three days
of talks that led to the signing of the peace plan. He said the
Sandinista forces fired mortars and long-range artillery into areas
proposed as cease-fire zones for the rebels.
   ``We consider this part of the strategy to wear down the
resistance's forces,'' he told journalists at the meeting at Sapoa.
   Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, the Sandinista delegation's leader,
denied any cease-fire violations. But he acknowledged that last
week there were ``small incidents.''
   He said that was ``practically inevitable'' as long as the two
sides were not separated and their armies roamed the rural
mountains, plains and jungle.
   The government-run newspapers have charged the Contras with
breaking the cease-fire.
   Both sides offered differing views on the major issue of the
laying down of arms, which is not specifically dealt with in the
cease-fire agreement.
   Cuadra called it ``indispensable, a basic condition'' for the
plan to work.
   The Contra combatants, pointing to the vast number of
Nicaraguans carrying arms supplied by the government, say they will
never put down their weapons.
   ``As long as there is no real democracy, there will be no laying
down of arms,'' said Sanchez. ``When there is reconciliation, the
arms won't be necessary.''
   The Contra leaders proposed April 12 instead of today for the
next high-level meeting. The Sandinistas suggested Saturday or
April 15.
   The two sides can't agree on how the visit will be handled.
   The rebels are insisting on free movement during their stay in
the capital, saying they want to meet with a variety of opposition
groups.
   The government claims it has to guard their security. Cuadra
said, ``It's not a visit for a political campaign.''
   The Sandinistas, who came to power in a 1979 revolution, signed
the peace agreement at a time when they faced strong internal
political, social and economic pressures.
   The government, backed by the Soviet bloc, retreated on several
hard-line positions. They had vowed never to hold talks with the
rebels, discuss internal policies or start political amnesty
proceedings.
   The first 100 of 3,310 political prisoners were released March
29 in accordance with the peace agreement.
   The Contras approached the pact at a time of improved
battlefield strength. But they saw the last of their U.S.-supplied
military aid expire at the end of February. In signing the accord,
the Contras agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral
organization, such as the International Red Cross.

<HEAD>Court Orders Logging Halt</HEAD>

   A plan to clear hundreds of square miles of
timber around giant redwoods in Sequoia National Forest was halted
by a federal appeals court, which said the government approved the
logging too hastily.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling on Tuesday
came too late to block logging of about half the non-redwood timber
in widely scattered areas of the forest. A different panel of the
court refused to halt that operation last December while the appeal
was pending.
   ``If you were a tourist in a redwood grove of the Sequoia
National Forest, instead of finding a lush natural-vegetation
forest you would find dirt and redwood trees alone,'' said Ralph
Bradley, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, which went to court last May
to block the logging.
   ``They're going in with tractors and removing everything from
brush to pine to oak,'' he said.
   The court ordered a ban on further logging in seven tracts in
the forest 200 miles south of San Francisco, saying the government
approved an untested logging plan without a proper environmental
analysis.
   An industry spokesman, however, claimed victory because all
logging was not banned around the towering sequoias, some of them
400 to 500 years old.
   ``The forest is not shut down and the mills are going to
continue to operate,'' said Michael Haglund, who represented Sierra
Forest Products and Sequoia Forest Industries. ``This is a much
more limited injunction than the Sierra Club sought. It's much more
of a victory for us than it is for them.''
   The Sierra Club went to court after the U.S. Forest Service
decided that nine timber sale contracts would cause no significant
damage and would not require full-scale environmental impact
statements assessing the effects on the forest.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Price last fall refused to halt the
logging, saying the dispute was one over management of the forest.
The environmental group appealed.
   Haglund said Tuesday's injunction prevents logging of about 9
million board-feet of timber, at least temporarily until an
environmental plan is developed. In a five-year plan covering the
entire forest, the Forest Service proposes logging of 80 million to
90 million board-feet a year, Haglund said.
   The Sierra Club had hoped the court would address the five-year
plan for the entire forest, a subject not mentioned in the ruling.
But Bradley said the ruling at least will require the Forest
Service to take review the plan.
   In approving the clear-cutting plan, the Forest Service said it
would help to regenerate the redwoods by creating areas of bare
mineral soil and sunlight. But the court quoted a professional
forester as saying the method was experimental and unproven.
   Bradley said experts have told him it ultimately would destroy
the redwoods.
   ``By tractor-logging, almost assuredly you will end up with
damage to the roots ... and often exposure of the roots,'' he said.
``The other problem is tremendous soil compaction. The water that
normally would hit the ground and percolate down and provide
nourishment instead erodes off of the land.''

   Jesse Jackson broadened his support in Wisconsin
more than he deepened it, showing an ability to appeal to more
diverse elements of his party even while his share of white votes
still lagged, exit polls say.
   While his second-place finish to Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis on Tuesday can only hamstring Jackson's chances in New
York's April 19 primary, analysts said the Wisconsin results did
indicate that he has continuing appeal to Democrats.
   ``His support was more evenly distributed among the demographic
groups than it was in the past. He is doing better,'' said Doug
Muzzio, an ABC News poll analyst. ``The question is how much better
he can do, and how fast.''
   Dukakis, meanwhile, had a broad victory, winning support across
nearly all income, age, education and ideology groups. He won
blue-collar workers, union household members and Catholic voters,
all important constituencies in delegate-rich New York.
   But the exit polls indicated a certain lack of enthusiasm in
Dukakis' support, a factor that has the potential to be exploited
by Jackson _ if he finds a way to draw more white votes _ or by
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   ABC and CBS News-New York Times polls said Jackson won 23
percent of the white vote in Wisconsin, while an NBC News poll said
he had 28 percent. His share of the black vote was over 90 percent,
the surveys said.
   While his white support was well over the 8 percent he got in
Illinois on March 15, the ABC and CBS-Times figure was about even
with Jackson's showing in Connecticut last week and less than his
32 percent in Vermont on March 1.
   ``We may be looking at his ceiling here. ... If the past is any
guide he's going to be in that quarter of the white vote as the
upper limit,'' Muzzio said. ``There's something that he's bumping
up against.''
   There were positive signs for Jackson even in his defeat. He was
rated favorably by 55 percent of Democratic voters in the CBS-Times
poll. Forty percent viewed him unfavorably.
   ``It isn't that Jackson isn't liked,'' said Kathleen A.
Frankovic, a CBS News pollster. ``It's just that Dukakis is liked
better.'' Dukakis had a 74 percent favorable rating, 22 percent
unfavorable.
   Jackson's supporters, if fewer in number, were more
enthusiastic. The CBS-Times poll said 60 percent of his voters were
strongly for him while 31 percent had some reservations. Gore's
strong backers also led his weak ones by 2-1, while Dukakis
supporters were split evenly, 45 percent strong, 44 percent with
reservations.
   ``Dukakis' support is softer than either Gore's or Jackson's,''
said Pama Mitchell, another CBS poll analyst. Stronger supporters
are more likely to go to the polls, an important factor when a race
is close.
   The NBC poll also showed some dissatisfaction with Dukakis among
his own supporters; four in 10 said they wished some other
candidate were running. At the same time, more than six in 10
Democrats overall said Dukakis would make the best nominee of the
current contenders.
   Jackson's support from white voters in other states has been
strongest among liberals with more education and higher incomes. In
Wisconsin it was more evenly spread, albeit still weighted toward
liberals, Muzzio said.
   The NBC poll had Jackson winning 23 percent of the conservatives
who voted Democratic and 24 percent of the moderates, as well as 42
percent of the liberals. Gore's strongest showing was among
conservatives, also 23 percent.
   In all, the results again showed ``a dual electorate: a black
electorate and a white electorate,'' with Jackson winning only the
blacks, said Muzzio. For example, ABC said Dukakis won blue-collar
voters narrowly _ 41 percent to 37 percent for Jackson _ when all
were considered, but far more strongly _ 47 to 27 _ among just the
white blue-collar workers.
   ``For Dukakis it was a substantial victory,'' Muzzio said. For
Jackson, he said, ``He's in a middle-America state where he's
getting 23 percent (of the white vote). It's good, but the question
is, can he expand it?''
   The polls had margins of sampling error of about 3 points.

<HEAD>American Troops and Supplies Arrive in Panama</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As military transport jets brought in
the first of 1,300 additional U.S. troops, Panama's military regime
said it was willing to negotiate with the opposition _ then
inexplicably withdrew the offer.
   The government, which is controlled by the Defense Forces chief,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, issued a statement Tuesday saying it
was willing to meet with opposition leaders in talks mediated by
the Roman Catholic Church.
   Later, the government said the statement was void and sent a
messenger to news organizations' offices to reclaim it. No
explanation was given for the move, and government officials met
late into the evening.
   Opposition leaders have said they will not enter such talks
until the government frees all political prisoners, allows
opposition news media to reopen and promises that Noriega will be
willing to resign and leave Panama.
   The government statement had not addressed those conditions.
   Also Tuesday, leading opposition activist Ricardo Arias Calderon
asked for the protection of the Catholic Church after four carloads
of state security police surrounded his home. Calderon, who is
president of the Christian Democratic Party, fled his home before
the police arrived and appeared later with the Rev. Oscar Brown,
the auxiliary archbishop of Panama City.
   U.S. military transports began touching down about once an hour
at Howard Air Force Base near Panama City on Tuesday in an airlift
that was to bring another 1,300 troops, 26 helicopters, police dogs
and equipment into the country by late Thursday.
   The extra forces were ordered after a five-week campaign of
economic and political pressure failed to oust Noriega, whose
strength lies in the 15,000-strong Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Noriega was indicted in the United States in February on federal
charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine. U.S. economic
sanctions have since prompted Panama's banks to close and the
government has been unable to meets its payroll.
   The reinforcements were sent after reports U.S. citizens were
harassed by Panamanian soldiers and several American reporters were
briefly arrested during a police raid on opposition headquarters in
a Panama City hotel.
   The government has repeatedly accused the Reagan administration
of preparing to invade Panama.
   The first U.S. troops arrived Tuesday in C-141 Starlifter
transport jets that brought airborne military police based at Fort
Bragg, N.C. Other troops were due from Fort Mead, Md., and Fort
Ord, Calif.
   There is no limit on the length of their stay.
   The U.S. government has said the additional soldiers are needed
to protect the 10,000 troops in the former Panama Canal Zone and to
guard the canal, American citizens and installations.
   A contingent of 500 military police arrived in mid-March. The
new arrivals will bring American troop strength to about 11,800.
   Army officials say there were no plans for the new troops to
leave the old Canal Zone, which was turned over to Panama in 1979
as part of the 1977 treaties that cede control of the canal to
Panama by the year 2000.
   The U.S. national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell,
said in Santa Barbara, Calif., on Tuesday that the United States
has no plans to send more troops to Panama but ``would not
eliminate that possibility.''
   Government-controlled newspapers on Tuesday quoted Panama's
Health Ministry as calling the new U.S. troops potential AIDS
carriers.
   The ministry was quoted as saying tests by the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta showed U.S. military personnel have ``a
high rate'' of infection with the aquired immune deficiency
syndrome virus.
   ``Knowing their clinical history, we can do no less than exhort
our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with
these soldiers,'' the ministry was quoted as saying.
   A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control said it does not
test military personnel.
   The country's Catholic leader, Archbishop Marcos McGrath, has
been asked by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain to mediate an end to Panama's
crisis.
   But the government has accused McGrath of siding with the
opposition. State-run newspapers have called the archbishop, who
was born in Philadelphia, a ``tool of the Yankees.''

   Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn said if he were to
emerge from a brokered Democratic National Convention this summer
with the party's nomination, he would go on to win the presidency.
   ``If I were nominated, I think I'd be elected,'' Nunn said
Tuesday after a speech to college students in Cochran.
   However Nunn told a Dublin gathering he's not likely to get the
nomination.
   ``I think it's most likely that someone running now will get the
nomination,'' said Nunn. ``But it's not impossible for someone
who's not running to get the nomination.
   ``But if that happens, it's not likely to be somebody from the
moderate-conservative wing of the Democratic Party,'' he noted.
``It's more likely to be someone who would come from the more
liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
   ``Whether it's Rev. (Jesse) Jackson or (Massachusetts) Gov.
(Michael) Dukakis or anyone else, if they don't go to the
convention with a majority, I don't think they ought to be
guaranteed they're going to get one,'' he said. ``The purpose of

<TEXT>
   With their candidate out of the
presidential race, the leaders of Kansas Sen. Bob Dole's New Jersey
campaign have formally thrown their support to Vice President
George Bush.
   With the announcement Tuesday, virtually everyone in New
Jersey's Republican establishment is now publicly backing Bush's
bid for the White House.
   ``The code word of the day is unity,'' former state
Transportation Commissioner Roger Bodman, the vice chairman of
Bush's New Jersey campaign, said at a news conference.
   Four of the most visible Dole supporters in New Jersey attending
the news conference wearing Bush buttons, included Assembly
Majority Leader Garabed `Chuck' Haytaian, who had been co-chairman
of Dole's campaign in the Garden State, former state Transportation
Secretary John Sheridan, who had been Dole's New Jersey campaign
manager, State Sen. Richard Zimmer and Assemblyman John T.
Hendrickson Jr.
   Republican Rep. Marge S. Roukema, another leader of Dole's New
Jersey drive, did not attend the news conference but she has phoned
Bush to express her support for him, fellow Republicans said.
   Two weeks ago Gov. Thomas H. Kean and the state's county
Republican chairmen formally endorsed Bush's candidacy.

Democratic leaders will do all they can to keep Jesse Jackson from
getting the presidential nomination.
   Kean, who is mentioned as a GOP vice presidential possibility,
said he believes Democratic ``super delegates'' would team to block
Jackson's nomination.
   The super delegates are national, state and local leaders
allowed by party rules to remain uncommitted until the Democrats'
convention, which begins July 18 in Atlanta.
   Kean, speaking to reporters here, said he believes Jackson's
candidacy would be opposed because party leaders believe a black
can't win the White House, and because of Jackson's sometimes
radical ideas.
   ``They don't think he can win, and they don't want him as
president,'' Kean said.
   Kean said he believes Jackson can capture enough delegates in
upcoming New York, New Jersey and California primary elections to
keep him in numerical competition with Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the party's other possible presidential contender.

   Democrat Rose Mofford, who began her
government career 47 years ago as a secretary, was sworn in as
Arizona's first female governor, saying she's proud of her new job
but sad about how she got it.
   Mrs. Mofford, 65, widely known as ``Auntie Rose,'' commenced her
term with wholesale housecleaning of the administration of Evan
Mecham, the elected Republican governor convicted and removed from
office Monday by a Senate court of impeachment.
   She ordered Mecham's personal staff of about 20 off the payroll
as of April 15, withdrew the names of 45 Mecham appointees from
Senate consideration for now and said she would review agency
chiefs to see who would stay.
   Mrs. Mofford, who had been acting governor since Feb. 5, also
promised to sign a tax increase, a policy opposed by the Mecham
administration, but did not know how large it would be.
   ``I am relieved to have the `acting' qualifier removed from in
front of the title of this office, and I am moving forward with
enthusiasm,'' Mrs. Mofford, who became Arizona's 18th governor,
told a news conference.
   ``Little did I realize 47 years ago that this would happen,''
she told an invitation-only group of staff members in her protocol
office earlier in the day.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor in 59 years to lose his job
through impeachment conviction, told supporters Tuesday he isn't
ready to give up politics.
   ``This is just another chapter in a book, and this book isn't
near the end,'' he said. ``I haven't yet determined what my course
will be.''
   Also Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court allowed a pro-Mecham
group to drop its challenge to the May 17 gubernatorial recall
election. Concerned Arizona Voters said it wanted to dismiss its
case because it now sees the recall as the former governor's last
hope for regaining his office.
   However, Mecham attorney Jerris Leonard said he does not believe
Mecham can run in any election until 1990 because the Senate
removed him from the four-year term he began in January 1987.
   The Supreme Court could decide this week whether a recall
election is necessary since Mecham was the target.
   It is possible the election could remove Mrs. Mofford from
office. Her chief of staff, Andrew Hurwitz, said he had been
negotiating with acting Secretary of State Karen Osborne and
Attorney General Bob Corbin in hopes of exempting Mrs. Mofford from
the recall.
   Corbin believes the recall should be held as scheduled, but Mrs.
Osborne, a longtime Mofford aide, hopes to have it cancelled.
   Mrs. Mofford has refused to comment about the recall, and a
state resign-to-run law could put her in jeopardy if she campaigns
actively.
   ``I have no idea,'' she said when asked aboput her plans for the
recall election. ``The courts are going to have to decide it.''
   Also uncertain was Mecham's ballot status.
   Mrs. Mofford said she hoped to decide shortly on which
nominations to resubmit and which agency officials to keep. Most of
the nominees can continue serving in the interim and are on
relatively minor boards and commissions.
   She also said she planned to travel to Washington next week to
lobby for Arizona as the site of the Superconducting Super Collider
and to testify before Congress on the Central Arizona Project, a
giant canal system.
   Mrs. Mofford, known throughout government for her silver beehive
hairdo and her stories about her days as a champion softball
player, said she was proud to be the first woman in charge of the
government where she has worked with 11 of the state's 17 previous
governors, but added, ``It's very sad that I had to be elevated
this way.''
   She has been the elected secretary of state for the last nine
years and had been serving as acting governor since Mecham was
impeached by the state House in February. Arizona does not have a
lieutenant governor.

<HEAD>With Wisconsin, Colorado in Hand, Dukakis Turns to New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Invigorated by victories in Wisconsin and
Colorado, Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis today
turned his attention to New York, with its delegate-heavy primary
two weeks away.
   Dukakis told reporters late Tuesday night that the results of
the past two days ``give us a very, very good boost'' in New York's
``very, very important primary.''
   The Massachusetts governor had campaign appearances today in New
York and in Pennsylvania. The New York primary is April 19;
Pennsylvania's is a week later.
   Dukakis won comfortably in Wisconsin, and said the victory
demonstrates his broad appeal.
   ``We have done well with people all over Wisconsin, in all
income and age groups, in all parts of Wisconsin,'' he said.
   Dukakis' key assets in New York appear to be money _ he has the
most to spend, possibly as much as $3 million _ and newfound
momentum.
   But the Massachusetts governor said he placed little stock in
the latter: ``I'm not a great fan of the momentum theory of
politics. I'm a great fan of the marathon theory.''
   Nor was he willing to say that New York, with 255 delegates at
stake, offered him a chance to deliver ``a knockout punch'' to
Jesse Jackson after his Wisconsin and Colorado wins this week.
   ``This is going to be a 15-round bout, and it will be a
decision,'' he insisted. ``There's no such thing as a knockout
punch.''
   Dukakis, who declined to directly attack Jackson in Wisconsin,
appeared unlikely to do so in New York, a state with a
substantially larger black population.
   ``I'm not going to spend an awful lot of time criticizing other
people. I think it's very important (that a) strong and positive
message be the message that people associate with Mike Dukakis,''
he said.
   Dukakis was asked about the endorsement of Gov. Mario Cuomo,
reluctant to run for president himself but equally reluctant to
anoint any other Democrat.
   ``I'd like to have it,'' Dukakis said. ``He knows that. But it's
his decision to make, and I'll respect whatever decision he makes.
It's up to him.''
   He denied a published report that Cuomo had made Dukakis'
selection of Jackson as his running mate a condition of an
endorsement.
   Dukakis has a meeting set Monday with an Hasidic Jewish leader,
Bobover Grand Rebbe Solomon Halberstam of Brooklyn. About a quarter
of New York's voters are Jewish.
   Dukakis' wife, Kitty, is Jewish, and she has noted in campaign
visits here that she would be the first Jewish first lady. On
Monday she made a telephone call to a Soviet Jew who is trying to
emigrate to the United States, and later she talked to an audience
on Long Island about her daughter's first Passover seder away from
home and her own involvement in Jewish issues.
   Various polls of New York Democrats have Dukakis leading, with
support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent. Jackson has been
consistently second at just under 30 percent, and Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois have yet to crack
double digits in any of the polls.

<HEAD>Holiday Viewers Choose British Royalty Over American Immigrants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Holiday television viewers opted for a love
story about British royalty over a tale of American immigrants
starring Sophia Loren, but part of the network audience simply
tuned out.
   Easter Sunday was a battle of the network movies, with CBS
handily winning over NBC. That didn't keep NBC from winning the
week, though, its fifth straight and 24th in the 30-week season,
which ends in two weeks.
   For the week that ended Sunday, NBC had an average rating of
14.6. ABC had 12.8 and CBS 12.6, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
The season-to-date averages are: NBC 16.2, ABC 13.8, CBS 13.5. CBS
is finishing in last place in prime time for the first time ever.
   The ``CBS Evening News,'' however, continued in first place,
adding to the consternation of NBC, which has seen ``Nightly News''
fall from first to third in the three-way network news race this
season.
   In the most recent ratings, the ``CBS Evening News'' had a
rating of 10.5; ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 10.3; and ``NBC
Nightly News'' 9.0.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions.
   The top-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``The Cosby
Show'' NBC, with a 25.1 rating; ``A Different World'' NBC;
``Cheers'' NBC; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC; ``Golden Girls'' NBC;
``ALF'' NBC; ``The Wonder Years'' ABC; ``Matlock'' NBC; ``Growing
Pains'' ABC; and ``Addicted to His Love'' ABC.
   The three networks lost viewers on Easter Sunday. The
three-network share, or percentage of the viewing audience, is an
average 71 for the season. On Sunday it was 67. It was 69 for the
week.
   ``The Woman He Loved,'' the story of King Edward VIII's
abdication to marry American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson won
the night for CBS. The movie, starring Jane Seymour and Anthony
Andrews, had a rating of 14.5 and a 25 share and ranked 27th.
   But the highest-rated made-for-TV movie was last Monday's
``Addicted to His Love'' on ABC, which was 10th with an 18.1 rating
and 29 share.
   ABC came in second for the night with ``Superman II'' followed
by a news special, ``The Unruly Dragon.''
   NBC launched the two-part ``The Fortunate Pilgrim,'' starring
Sophia Loren, on Sunday, but it got a 13.1 and 22 share and ranked
40th.
   NBC attributed the low rating to the holiday and a poor start on
the evening with a repeat of an Andy Williams special that was dead
last in the network rankings.
   That showing also contributed to the low rating for a repeat
``Family Ties,'' a formerly top-10 show that landed in the bottom
10 last week.
   Saturday's NCAA basketball semifinals on CBS ranked 38th, but
apparently gave a boost to ``West 57th,'' which had a 20 share and
wasn't among the bottom 10 for a change. NBC won the night with
repeats.

<HEAD>Jackson Brushes Aside Wisconsin Loss, Says Has Momentum For New
York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

   Democrat Jesse Jackson says he is going on
to New York's big primary with momentum and a broadening base of
white support despite falling short in Wisconsin, where he had
hoped to claim an important second Northern victory over Michael
Dukakis.
   ``I'm a long-distance runner,'' Jackson said Tuesday, trying to
look beyond the disappointment of two loses to Dukakis in two
days.``It is a 50-state, decathalon event.
   ``I'm not inclined to pull the flower out of the vase after
every race to see if the flower's still growing,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson lost to Dukakis, 47 percent to 28 percent, in Wisconsin,
a traditionally liberal-voting state where he had hoped to deal
another blow to Dukakis as he did in Michigan's caucuses a week and
a half ago. He also lost narrowly to Dukakis in Colorado's caucuses.
   Both were states where expectations had been raised for Jackson
by his landslide victory in Michigan, his apparent growth in white
voter support in Michigan and Connecticut last week, and the huge,
enthusiastic crowds he had drawn in campaigning in both states.
   In both states he had waged a populist campaign of appeal to the
downtrodden and working people in an effort to forge a coalition of
blacks, whites and Hispanics.
   Jackson continued to draw big crowds Tuesday as he began his
campaign toward Arizona's caucuses on April 16.
   He spoke to more than 7,000 students in the domed stadium at
Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where he also met with
Indian tribal leaders.
   In his Tempe speech, Jackson outlined in new specifics his plan
for cutting $100 billion in annual deficits by the year 1993. He
said he would freeze Pentagon spending, raising the top income tax
rate from 28 percent to 38.5 percent, and moving corporate taxes
back toward 1970s levels as a percentage of gross national product.
   Jackson appeared with the former Democratic presidential
candidate and former Arizona governor, Bruce Babbitt, at a large
rally at Arizona State University in Tempe, before some 8,000
people.
   Babbitt, who dropped out of the race Feb. 18, praised Jackson as
having ``brought new fire into the hearts of the American people,''
but stopped short of endorsing his candidacy.
   Jackson insisted there was no disappointment with his twin
loses, contending he had run good campaigns and clearly established
a broader base among white voters.
   ``We got to New York with a good campaign, a broad-based
campaign, momentum, a clear message _ a message that applies to New
York,'' he said.
   Jackson said he has finished first or second in 30 of 40
delegate contests.
   ``I feel good with the pace, our momentum, and our growth at
this stage,'' he said.
   Polling of voters leaving voting sites by television networks
suggested Jackson received a quarter or more of the white vote in
Wisconsin _ somewhat more than he received in Connecticut and
beyond what once had seemed a 10 percent barrier for his candidacy.
   ``Our white vote base continues to expand dramatically,'' he
said.
   He said the Wisconsin results show he has ``the broadest base of
support'' among the Democrats.
   ``We went against the odds of machinery and money and culture,
and yet we see cultural expansion, we see greater participation, we
see more white support, and we come out of Colorado and Wisconsin
with a (total) popular vote lead. ... I have to feel good about
that going into New York.''
   In all the primaries so far, however, Dukakis leads by a slight
margin in the popular vote, with 3,559,364 to Jackson's 3,487,843.
   Jackson continued to protest the slow count of caucus results in
Colorado and his criticism of the state party chairman there, Buie
Seawell, who endorsed Dukakis. He said the slow count ``represents
a sort of manipulation that's not good.''

   The government will allow all prisoners
freed from re-education camps to resettle in the United States, but
only if they promise not to participate in future anti-communist
activities, a senior official said.
   ``We are ready to let them go to the United States ... but these
people, when they go ... they must refrain from doing anything
against Vietnam,'' Nguyen Dy Nien, a deputy foreign minister, told
U.S. Sen. Larry Pressler.
   Nien on Tuesday said there were no barriers in principle to the
resettlement of the former prisoners but a U.S. official must come
to Hanoi to negotiate the program. He said only technical details
need to be worked out.
   Nien did not specify how many Vietnamese might be involved in
the resettlement program.
   Pressler, a South Dakota Republican, arrived Tuesday in Vietnam
to discuss the fate of 1,767 Americans missing in action from the
Vietnam War.
   Communist North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed government in
South Vietnam in April 1975.
   U.S. Secretry of State George P. Shultz said in 1984 the United
States would take all officals from the former Saigon government
held in the political re-education camps established by the
communists after they seized power.
   Since then, Vietnam appears to have wavered somewhat on its
offer.
   The pragmatic new administration of Communist Party Seneral
Gecretary Nguyen Van Linh, as part of a national reconciliation
policy, has freed large numbers of the prisoners over the past
year. The last major release came during the Lunar New Year holiday
in mid-February.
   But U.S. officials say Vietnam has allowed only a few of the
former prisoners to leave the country.
   The United States has been trying to resettle the former
prisoners under its Orderly Departure Program, which allows
Vietnamese refugees and migrants to take regular commercial flights
out of Vietnam and resettle in the West.

<HEAD>FBI Refuses To Declassify Records Sought By LaRouche Lawyers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge and the FBI are at loggerheads
over the agency's refusal to declassify seven files the judge has
ruled as relevant to Lyndon LaRouche's claims of government
infiltration and harassment.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said the FBI notified him
Tuesday afternoon that the agency did not want to declassify the
files because they contain information about sensitive national
security matters.
   The agency reviewed the files following U.S. District Judge
Robert Keeton's ruling that material in them is relevant to defense
claims that the FBI used a former LaRouche security consultant as
an informant during the investigation that led to LaRouche's July
1987 indictment.
   Keeton, who reviewed the files, has not indicated what in them
he considers relevant to the case. Markham said he would ask the
judge at a hearing today to list the material in the files he
considered relevant.
   If judge rules the entire files should be given to defense
lawyers, or that the FBI should release portions it believes should
be kept secret, the government could ask the 1st U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals to overrule Keeton.
   Testimony in the case has been halted four of the last five
weeks because of battles over access to government records, mostly
files of Vice President George Bush, the National Security Council,
the CIA and the FBI. The earliest testimony could resume is Monday.
   The seven classified FBI files were given to Keeton last week
during hearings on whether the FBI employed former LaRouche
security consultant Ryan Quade Emerson as an informant during the
LaRouche investigation.
   The FBI has said it used Emerson very briefly during the
investigation of the political extremist, but the defense contends
the agency is concealing Emerson's true role because he was used to
entrap the defendants.
   The defense raised the infiltration allegations during pretrial
hearings more than a year ago, but unsucessfully pursued the theory
in court until gaining access a month ago to declassified documents
that discuss apparent infiltration of LaRouche groups. The
declassified documents included a memo between former White House
aide Oliver North and another pivotal figure in the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   LaRouche lawyers have accused Markham of withholding the
documents and other evidence, and have said they would seek
dismissal of the case following the infiltration hearings. Keeton
also has the option to dismiss the case if he orders the FBI to
release information and it refuses to do so.
   LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche political organizations
are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury
investigation into allegations LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign raised more than $2 million through credit card and loan
fraud.

   The Arabs who hijacked a Kuwaiti jetliner
to Iran appear to be part of the Iranian-linked network of
terrorists that includes the Shiite Moslem extremists who hold
Americans hostage in Lebanon.
   The hijackers, whose identity and nationality are not known,
have made the same demand as the Americans' captors _ freedom for
17 pro-Iranian extremists jailed in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and
French embassies there in 1983.
   Kuwait, a tiny oil-rich desert emirate trapped in the crossfire
of the Iran-Iraq war, has doggedly refused to free any of them. It
reiterated Tuesday that it will not bow to ``blackmail.''
   Like Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, the two Americans
held captive in Lebanon since 1985, the passengers and crew members
held hostage aboard Kuwait Airways Flight 422 have become pawns in
a war between the acolytes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and
opponents of his Islamic revolution.
   Kuwait, like most of Iran's Persian Gulf Arab neighbors, is a
conservative state ruled by Sunni Moslems, historic rivals of the
Shiite sect who make up the vast majority of Iran's 50 million
people.
   Like other Arab states, Kuwait fears that Iran's fundamentalist
Islamic revolution will spread its way, inciting its Shiite
minority into insurrection.
   Galvanized by Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and Khomeini's
revolution, Lebanon's long-downtrodden Shiites launched suicide
bombings against the Israelis and later U.S. and French troops who
took part in an ill-fated multinational peacekeeping force in
Lebanon.
   In the past five years, Shiite extremists have particularly
targeted Kuwait, which Iran accuses of aiding Iraq in the Persian
Gulf war.
   The 17 people whose release the hijackers demand were convicted
of a wave of bombings in 1983 that killed five people and wounded
86 and culminated in attacks on the U.S. and French embassies in
Kuwait.
   Later terrorist attacks on Kuwait included an abortive 1985
assassination attempt on the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah.
   Three of the 17 were sentenced to death _ two Iraqis, Baqer
Ibrahim Abdel-Reda and Hussein Qassem Hassan, and a Lebanese named
as Elias Fuad Saab.
   The Shiite kidnappers in Lebanon are particularly interested in
springing Saab because he is a cousin of Imad Mugniyeh, who Western
and Lebanese intelligence believe to be the mastermind of Islamic
Jihad, or Holy War, and other extremist Shiite factions behind a
chain of suicide bombings, kidnappings and aircraft hijackings in
recent years.
   Saab's real name is Mustafa Youssef, and Western intelligence
officials believe he rigged the bombs used in the Kuwait attacks.
   Kuwait has so far not carried out the death sentences handed
down on Youssef and his fellow bombers, apparently after appeals
from Washington.
   But that appears to have been its only concession. Scores of
other Shiites have been arrested for sabotage since 1983. In 1985,
Kuwait's now-suspended Parliament passed a law decreeing capital
punishment for using explosives to kill or cause terror, and life
imprisonment for possessing explosives.
   Mugniyeh, 36, is a key figure in the security apparatus of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed Shiite movement
believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 22
foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   His family has been closely linked for many years with the
Hamadis, another Shiite clan deeply involved in kidnappings.
   Both clans are from the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
   Mugniyeh and Mohammed Ali Hamadi, held in West Germany on
charges of smuggling explosives, have been named by U.S.
authorities as two of the four Lebanese Shiites involved in the
June 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner in which U.S. Navy diver
Robert Dean Stethem was killed.
   The Hamadis, using various cover names, allegedly kidnapped
three West Germans in Beirut in an effort to force Bonn to free
Mohammed and one of his brothers, Abbas, who is currently on trial
in Duesseldorf for kidnapping two Germans. A third Hamadi brother,
Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, the linchpin of the clan, is Hezbollah's
security chief.
   The Mugniyehs are thought to have kidnapped Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. Seized March
16, 1985, Anderson is the longest held of the missing foreigners.

   The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen
today in Tokyo, while stock prices also posted a moderate gain
following the overnight advance on Wall Street.
   The dollar closed at 125.03 yen, up 0.60 yen from its close of
124.43 yen on Tuesday. It had opened the day higher at 125.23 and
ranged between 124.83-125.40 yen.
   ``Trading was in narrow range without anything in particular to
direct the market,'' said Michiko Kawai of the Bank of Tokyo.
   A senior trader at the same bank said eyes are turning to the
annoucement next week of the U.S. trade figures for February. The
dollar may trade narrowly until then, he said.
   According to Kawai, traders maintained favorable prospect for
the trade figures.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which added a small 19.94 points Tuesday, gained
another 195.82 points, or 0.74 percent and finished the day at
26,511.17 points.
   ``Buying spreaded among more issues as participants were
confident about the market condition,'' said Masahiro Umemori of
Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   The overnight advance on Wall Street and the stabilizing foreign
exchange market prompted buying, he said.
   Traders said New York stocks' firmness overnight helped
investors overcome their reservations about how New York might
respond to recent weakness in the U.S. bond market.

<HEAD>Tom Selleck Honored by Hawaii Legislature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Tom Selleck told lawmakers honoring him to
mark the conclusion of his 8-year-old Hawaii-based television
series that the state should make it less costly for film producers
to work in the islands.
   Selleck and other members of the ``Magnum P.I.'' production team
were honored Tuesday by the state Legislature.
   In brief remarks before the House and Senate, Selleck said the
``Magnum P.I.'' production has spent ``$100 million pollution-free,
tourism-promoting dollars in Hawaii.''
   Yet Hawaii's film industry is less than competitive because of
the high costs, Selleck said.
   One solution is to restructure the lease terms for the state's
film studio at Diamond Head, making it more attractive to new
producers who will add more money to the state's economy, Selleck
said.
   Charging $25,000 a month rent, $1,300 a month in taxes and
$1,000 for permits ``does not send the right signal'' to film
producers who might be interested in working in Hawaii, he said.
   ``Hawaii has been good fo me and I would like to put something
back,'' Selleck said. ``I hope you accept these remarks in that
spirit.''
   Selleck said being honored in the Legislature ``is the icing on
the cake _ the cake being working and living in Hawaii for the past
eight years.''

<HEAD>Honasan Vows New Attacks On Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fugitive leader of an August coup
attempt promised to stage new attacks on the government, but
President Corazon Aquino today said mutineers lacked enough support
to oust her.
   A statement attributed to former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan said his group promised last November to cease hostile acts
against Mrs. Aquino to give her time to fulfill promises to improve
the government. Mrs. Aquino made the promises after Honasan's the
Aug. 28 coup attempt.
   ``We are now withdrawing that declaration,'' said the statement
from Honasan, 39. ``It has become obvious by its own actions, that
the Aquino administration is incapable of ensuring the very
survival of this nation over the next few years. We have to act and
act boldly.''
   The statement was distributed today to news organizations.
Honasan escaped Saturday from a prison ship in Manila Bay, where he
had been held since his arrest Dec. 9. Military spokesman Col.
Oscar Florendo said troops had found no trace of Honasan despite a
nationwide search.
   Mrs. Aquino today told reporters her government had taken steps
to correct problems raised by Honasan during his abortive coup
attempt, in which at least 53 people were killed and hundreds
wounded.
   ``I think he will have to admit that the government had
adequately answered already the legitimate grievances, and I think
the Filipino people definitely will go against Honasan,'' Mrs.
Aquino said. ``He will not be able to get any support.''
   Honasan's complaints included low military pay and lack of an
effective strategy against communist rebels. The coup attempt was
the most serious of six major bids to topple Mrs. Aquino since she
took office on Feb. 25, 1986.
   Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos described the Honasan statement
as ``a call to violence'' and said the author ``must have a
distorted sense of values.'' Ramos said he had ordered the military
to verify its authenticity.
   ``The letter, as you know, threatens not only the government but
the entire society,'' Ramos told reporters. ``I am very sure that
our people will reject such an undertaking by anyone.''
   National Security Adviser Emmanuel Soriano also doubted Honasan
could mount a serious coup attempt but said the government was in a
state of ``watchful waiting.'' Mrs. Aquino plans to go ahead with a
visit next week to China and Hong Kong.
   In his statement, Honasan said he and others jailed in previous
coup attempts had been detained for months without formal charges
or trial.
   He claimed the government was more concerned about protecting
the rights of jailed members of the Communist Party of the
Philippines and its armed wing, the New People's Army, rather than
those of its own soldiers.
   ``Apparently, this administration has no intention of effecting
genuine reconciliation in our fragmented society because of its
inordinate fear of losing power to people whose only vision is to
set a new direction toward good government and a reformed''
military, he said.
   ``To this day, after seven months, many officers and men
implicated in the August 28 incident are still detained without
charges and without trial.
   ``Their right to due process and speedy trial were completely
disregarded by the Aquino administration despite its pretensions of
being democratic and just, while affording the same rights to
captured'' communist guerrillas.

<HEAD>Fisherman Snags $5 Million In Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An angler says he knew ``something was fishy''
when he snagged a floating courier's bag that contained $5 million
in negotiable bonds while heading home in a boat after a day
fishing.
   Raymond Lucas, a 40-year-old maintenance man, turned the bag of
bank securities _ five negotiable bonds worth $5,090,058, and some
non-negotiable securities _ over to police on Tuesday.
   ``I didn't know what to do with them, but I knew something was
fishy,'' Lucas said Tuesday. After plucking the bag from Jamaica
Bay on Saturday, he asked asked neighbor Frank LaSpisa to look at
the papers.
   ``He was flabbergasted when I told him what they were,'' LaSpisa
said. ``He said `Oh, my God.' We started to shake.''
   Bonds that are negotiable can be cashed in by the bearer rather
than the registered owner of the bonds.
   LaSpisa, a retired district manager for a book manufacturer,
said the pair didn't really consider keeping the bonds.
   ``I'm sure there was a way to cash them in if we wanted to, but
we wanted to take the honest way,'' LaSpisa said. ``We're hoping
we'll get a little compensation for it.''
   He said that after he examined the bonds he called a friend, a
retired police detective, who advised him to turn in the satchel.
   The bag, stamped ``DHL-Worldwide,'' was reported missing
Saturday from Kennedy International Airport, where it was being
moved from a terminal by a DHL Worldwide Express van, said police
spokesman James Coleman.
   Port Authority police began investigating after the van driver,
Stephen Doer, reported that the bag apparently had fallen out of
the van, Coleman said.
   DHL collected the satchel Tuesday. A company spokesman in San
Francisco, Dick Rossi, said he could not comment because the matter
was under investigation.
   Rossi said the courier service's policy is not to carry
negotiable instruments.
   Asked why he was turning in the bonds, Lucas replied, ``I'm just
trying to do the right thing.''

   ``Fatal Attraction,'' nominated for an
Academy Award as best film, will not win any prizes from this
quiet, suburban hamlet.
   In fact, the ruckus that accompanied the movie's filming here
prompted the town board to approve an ordinance Tuesday tightening
restrictions on movie-making.
   Board members voted 3-2 to make film crews appear before the
board to obtain a permit, whether the filming is on private or
public land.
   Town Supervisor Larry Dwyer said the community is often used for
films and television commercials, but ``Fatal Attraction'' caused
too many problems. He said the film crew blocked roads when school
buses were trying to get by, annoyed townspeople with bright lights
for night filming and rented private property for commercial use.
   ``No matter what urging we gave, no matter what cooperation we
asked, there was continued abuse,'' Dwyer said.

<HEAD>The House On Charlotte Street Yields Torture Photos, Police Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents may be offensive to some readers.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 photographs of bound,
tortured men were found in the bedroom of a man whose house and
yard yielded skulls and bone fragments after his arrest on assault
and sodomy charges, police said.
   Robert A. Berdella's $500,000 bond was revoked Tuesday at a
court hearing in which a police officer said one man, photographed
bound and hanging from his ankles in Berdella's basement, appeared
to be dead.
   Berdella, 39, was arrested Saturday after a 22-year-old man
wearing only a dog collar told police Saturday he had escaped from
Bardella's home after four days of torture and sexual assault.
   Bardella was charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy and
one count each of felonious restraint and first-degree assault.
   Authorities have searched Berdella's house and yard since his
arrest, after the man apparently escaped from Berdella's
three-story house by jumping from a second-story window and asked a
neighbor to call police.
   Michael Calderon, a neighbor, said Berdella told him about five
years ago he was using his home as a halfway house for runaways and
that young men often visited the house.
   ``I thought he was a father figure to those kids and I got
adjusted to the fact that there were boys at his house,'' said
Calderon.
   Berdella also organized a neighborhood watch program after
moving into the house on Charlotte Street, in a lower-middle class
section of midtown Kansas City, about 16 years ago.
   ``He led us to believe he was a nice guy, a leader in the
community,'' Calderon said. ``He was very active and made us feel
like second-class residents because we were not active.''
   On Tuesday, investigators using shovels and a backhoe found
small bone fragments in Berdella's back yard, but police did not
know whether they were human bones.
   Two skulls, one of which appears to be a relic, were found
inside Berdella's home Saturday. A third was discovered buried in
Berdella's back yard on Sunday. All are thought to be human.
   The buried skull still had hair and what appeared to be
deteriorating flesh on it and in the earth around it, according to
evidence in the hearing before Associate Circuit Judge Charles L.
Stitt.
   A Kansas State University forensic anthropologist told police
the skull had been buried for no more than a year, and probably was
buried about three months ago.
   Police found the photographs in a bedroom dresser near a room
where the 22-year-old man was believed held captive, Detective
Ashley Hurn said during the hearing.
   According to court records, the man's clothing and pieces of
rope bindings he said he had burned with matches to escape were
still in the room when police searched the house.
   Police also reported finding torture and bondage devices, which
they refused to describe.
   When police first entered the house Saturday, they found freshly
poured concrete in the basement, but drilled through the concrete
on Sunday and found nothing suspicious.
   Police also found files in the house that contained information
from newspaper articles about the disappearance of Gerald D.
Howell, 19, who has been missing since 1984, Hurn said.
   Howell's father, Paul Howell, has contended for several years
that Berdella was responsible for the disappearance. When Berdella
appeared for a court hearing Monday, Howell lunged at him and had
to be restrained by police.
   Police have confirmed that they are examining Berdella's
possessions for possible links to the unsolved disappearances of
Howell and others.

<TEXT>
   A small-town marshal who may have
faked his own abduction to gain attention from his estranged wife,
prompting a search by about 200 law officers and volunteers, has
been fired.
   Gary Stokes' dismissal Tuesday by the town aldermen was made
retroactive to Friday, when he reappeared from a daylong absence
saying he had been kidnapped at gunpoint and escaped.
   Stokes, the only police officer for the town of 870 residents,
didn't attend the aldermen's meeting Tuesday night. City Attorney
Joe Gay said he would meet with Sheriff Leroy Meeks today to
discuss the case.
   The search began after Stokes' patrol car, its engine running,
and handgun were found outside a convenience store where he had
reportedly gone to investigate a burglary early Thursday.
   Stokes reappeared about 2:30 a.m. Friday in Myrtle, about 20
miles southwest of Blue Mountain, and told authorities the
abduction story. He had spent a night in an abandoned house,
investigators said.
   Investigators with the state Highway Patrol said Saturday that
they had determined the kidnapping story was false, but offered no
motive.
   Stokes has declined to comment on the case, but his stepmother
Mary Stokes has said he fabricated the highly-publicized incident
to gain attention from his estranged wife.
   ``It pushed him to the deepest end to do such a horrible
thing,'' she said earlier this week. ``It's a sad situation.''
   ``It hurt us,'' she said. ``We're relieved we know about it and
can get him some help.''
   Stokes' estranged wife, Denise Stokes, said Monday that she was
shocked by the incident, but declined any further comment.

<TEXT>
   Anthony Pelissier, who began his career as a stage
actor but won fame as a director of plays and films, has died. He
was 75.
   Pelissier died Saturday in Eastbourne on the English south
coast, his family said Tuesday night. The cause of death was not
disclosed.
   He directed and wrote the screenplays of two widely shown films,
``The History of Mr. Polly'' based on a novel by H.G. Wells, and
``The Rocking Horse Winner'' based on a short story by D.H.
Lawrence.
   Pelissier, who also directed and produced plays, was the son of
Fay Compton, a leading actress, and of theater producer H.G.
Pelissier.
   Pelissier made his acting debut in a London musical ``Follow
Through'' and was promptly fired when he and three other actors
missed two performances after getting stuck on a mudbank while
sailing on the Thames river estuary.
   Pelissier, who married four times, is survived by his fourth
wife, actress Ursula Howells, and by four children from his first
three marriages.

   Thunderstorms fell from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast today
after unleashing tornadoes, winds up to nearly 100 mph and hail as
big as baseballs that did widespread damage and cut power to
thousands of people.
   High temperature records up to 115 years old were broken or tied
Tuesday in 41 cities from the Great Lakes to the Southeast.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended along and ahead of a cold
front from the upper Great Lakes to Illinois, Indiana, the lower
Mississippi Valley and southeast Texas. There were around 100
reports of large hail or damaging winds Tuesday afternoon and
evening.
   In Chicago, a windsurfer saved one of two children on a raft
that had been pulled away from Lake Michigan's shore by high winds
and choppy water late Tuesday, but the second child was missing,
police said.
   Elsewhere in Illinois, winds gusting to 75 mph did considerable
damage to hangars and aircraft at the Bloomington airport. Six
people suffered minor injuries. High winds toppled trees and
destroyed mobile homes in Will County.
   Thousands of people in northeastern Illinois remained without
power today, said Commonwealth Edison Co. spokesman Bill Cormack.
Suburbs south of Chicago were the hardest hit and power lines also

   Police arrested a couple accused of running a
multimillion-dollar prostitution ring that used a computerized
client list and beepers to page its 450 hookers, authorities said.
   A woman cooperating in the investigation led police to the
alleged ringleaders, Dominick Volpe, 40, and his wife Sharon, 39.
They and Stuart Vigoda, 43, were indicted Tuesday on charges of
promoting prostitution.
   The alleged ring advertised in the Village Voice and Screw
Magazine as the Play Mate Escort Service and Party Mates. It had a
client list of 4,500 and operated out of an apartment in the
Whitestone district of Queens.
   Investigators infiltrated the ring in December by inviting two
of the service's employees to a bogus bachelor party. Police said
the women agreed to strip, perform lesbian sex and entertain the
groom and best man for two hours for $750.
   Police raiding the apartment found six phone lines and 20 phones.
   ``Their records and client list were computerized and the
prostitutes carried beepers,'' said Bruce Pless, an assistant
Suffolk County district attorney.
   ``From what we could gather, the take was over a million
(dollars) a year and they had been in operation for a couple
years,'' Pless said.
   Volpe was freed on $50,000 bail after being arraigned before
Suffolk County Supreme Court Justice George McInerny. His wife was
freed on $5,000 bail and Vigoda, a driver for the firm, on $10,000
bail.

   An investigator for the state attorney general's
office assigned to the Tawana Brawley case was arrested with
another man early today on drug charges, police said.
   The investigator, William West, 39, and Clarence Holder were
arrested after midnight, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Edward Burns.
   West and Holder, both of Brooklyn, were each charged with felony
sale of a controlled substance after they allegedly sold three
ounces of cocaine to an undercover officer for $2,800, Burns said.
   West is employed in Attorney General Robert Abrams office as a
confidential investigator assigned to the grand jury investigation
of Miss Brawley's alleged abduction and sexual assault in Dutchess
County last November, Burns said.
   Abrams was appointed special prosecutor in the case by Gov.
Mario Cuomo, but advisors to the 16-year-old Wappingers Falls girl
have refused to allow her or her family cooperate with authorities.
   Holder, whose age was unavailable, was employed at Beekman
Hospital, Burns said.

   Three of the 30 Kuwaitis aboard the Kuwait Airways
jumbo jet hijacked to Iran are named Al-Sabah, indicating they are
among the estimated 1,200 people who belong to the Persian Gulf
state's royal family.
   The airline identified the three, who were in the first-class
section, as Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, a man, and two women, Ebtesam
and Anware Khaled Al-Sabah. The two women have been identified as
sisters of Fadel.
   Like all other male members of the royal clan, Fadel can carry
the title of sheik. Sources in Kuwait who spoke on condition of
anonymity on Tuesday said Fadel is a businessman and distant
relative of the royal family.
   The Al-Sabah dynasty has ruled Kuwait for more than two
centuries and oversees vast oil wealth that gives it one of the
world's highest per capita incomes.
   The riches that began to flow from the discovery of oil were
used in the 1970s to set up a modern welfare state. Kuwait, until
recently, also boasted the only elected parliament in the region.
   But since 1980, Kuwait and its royal family have been plagued by
terrorism blamed on Iranian fundamentalists who have pledged to
spread their revolution throughout the Persian Gulf states.
   The emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, survived an
assassination attempt in May 1985 by a suicide driver who tried to
crash a bomb-laden car into the royal motorcade.
   Sheik Jaber escaped with minor wounds, but two security men and
two pedestrians were killed along with the bomber.
   The terrorist attacks have included bombings and the hijacking
of a Kuwait Airways jetliner in 1984.
   In that incident, two American passengers were slain by the
hijackers, who demanded freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists
imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies and
other targets in Kuwait in 1983.
   The Arabs who hijacked the Kuwaiti airliner Tuesday made the
same demand.
   The fundamentalist Islamic rulers of Iran, who have been at war
with Iraq for 7{ years, accuse Kuwait of aiding Iraq.
   Members of the Al-Sabah clan fill most senior posts in the
government, the army, the police and both the private and public
sectors of the emirate, which has a population of 1.7 million.
   They include the crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad
al-Abdullah al-Salem Al-Sabah, and the ministers of defense,
interior, foreign affairs and information.
   Even the hijacked plane is named after the ruler and has the
word Al-Jaberiya, Arabic for ``the plane of the Al-Jabers,''
emblazoned on its side.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar stayed mostly higher in quiet European
trading this morning after a brief early rally lost momentum.
   Gold prices fell as the dollar appeared to hold on to recent
gains, but dealers said they didn't expect the precious metal to
fall much further.
   Traders in Rome said any movement in the dollar this week is
likely to be limited, slow and hesitant because no major economic
news is expected.
   ``People are still bearish, but there is fear that the United
States is tightening monetary policy in order to control inflation,
and this has created some uncertainty,'' one Italian trader said.
   He added that this uncertainty is likely to persist until the
April 14 announcement of the U.S. trade figures for February.
   Dealers in Frankfurt cited few fundamental reasons for the
dollar's recovery. One cited higher U.S. interest rates and another
said the dollar received some support Tuesday from U.S. Federal
Reserve sales of Britain's pound.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.60 yen to a closing 125.03. Later, in London, it was
quoted slightly higher at 125.055 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates:
   _1.6692 West German marks, up from 1.6690
   _1.3770 Swiss francs, up from 1.3765
   _5.6575 French francs, down from 5.6605
   _1.8735 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8700
   _1,237.50 Italian lire, up from 1,234.50
   _1.2390 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2395
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.8780 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8800 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $452.30 a troy ounce. At
midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $450.80, down from Tuesday's late bid of
$451.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $451.10, down from $453.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped $5.60 to close at a bid
$453.21.
   Silver also fell in London today. It was selling at a bid price
of $6.59 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.65.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns 27 Remains Believed To Be Those Of Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military guards today reclaimed 27
remains believed to be those of Americans killed in the Vietnam War
_ the largest such repatriation since 1973.
   The U.S. military team saluted as the remains, each in a metal
case topped with a folded American flag, were loaded one by one
onto a U.S. Air Force cargo plane for a flight to army laboratories
in Hawaii. The brief, solemn ceremony was held under overcast skies.
   Vietnam also returned three other remains they identified as
those of ethnic Asians but who could be missing Americans.
   It was the largest such transfer of remains since the last
American forces withdrew from South Vietnam on March 29, 1973,
opening the way for the communist victory in April 1975. Three
million Americans served in Vietnam, and 58,000 died.
   Also today, Vietnamese officials angrily rejected charges that
Hanoi was dragging its feet on accounting for 1,767 Americans who
remain listed as missing in action in the war. Vietnam has
threatened to end its cooperation in repatriating other American
remains if Washington maintains its criticisms.
   In a meeting today with visiting U.S. Sen. Larry Pressler,
R-S.D., Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach responded heatedly to a
recent Pentagon suggestion that the communists have been storing
remains and returning them little by little, said an American
negotiator requesting anonymity.
   The head of Vietnam's accounting office for missing in action,
Nguyen Can, had dismissed the charge as ``nonsense'' the day
before. ``The next time they make such a statement, we will have to
reconsider whether we will do the job. This shows there is no
goodwill on the part of the U.S.''
   At today's ceremony, two dozen peasants in bamboo hats and other
bystanders with bicycles squatted in an adjacent field to watch as
the remains were turned over at Hanoi's Noi Bai airport.
   Pressler joined the team from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution
Center in saluting as the U.S. Army guard placed the caskets into
the belly of the C-141 plane.
   Lt. Col. Paul Mather, head of the U.S. casualty team, said the
Vietnamese provided a list of names for at least half of the 27
remains. Some of those names are on the official U.S. list, he
said. Most caskets contained many sizable pieces of bone, he said.
   Some of the remains were reportedly found near Hanoi, suggesting
they are those of airmen shot down during intense U.S. bombing runs
in the heartland of communist North Vietnam. The United States has
made such cases a priority because it says those remains are most
likely to be located.
   The United States and Vietnam, which have no diplomatic ties,
frequently have bickered over the issue of remains, and Hanoi thus
far has returned 152 remains that the U.S. Army has confirmed as
those of Americans missing in action. The previous largest transfer
was Aug. 14, 1985, and involved 26 remains, at least 24 of which
were positively identified as Americans.
   ``This being the largest, we hope it means increased
collaboration,'' U.S. Pacific Command spokeswoman Maj. Virginia
Byla said today. However, she agreed with other U.S. officials that
Vietnam has more information about remains than it has divulged.
   Pressler said he told Thach many Americans believe Vietnam was
not forthcoming on the issue and may even still be holding American
prisoners of war. He said Thach responded that if any U.S.
congressmen had evidence of such prisoners, the foreign minister
would personally accompany him in a helicopter to investigate.
   ``After this trip, I'm more convinced that they are making a
full faith effort to close this chapter, but it's not closed in the
minds of many Americans,'' said Pressler, a Vietnam War veteran.
   It was the fourth return of remains since Vietnam agreed in
August talks with U.S. presidential envoy John W. Vessey to resume
repatriation efforts after months of deadlock.
   But Vietnam's deputy foreign minister, Mguyen Dy Nien, on
Tuesday charged that Washington had failed to carry out its part of
the agreement. He said Vietnam was awaiting direct U.S. aid for
postwar reconstruction.
   If it wants a full accounting of its missing, Washington must
demonstrate ``its concern, its direct commitment,'' he told
Pressler.

   An early morning fire roared through a house
where more than eight people were staying, killing four people and
injuring five, including a firefighter, authorities said.
   An undisclosed number of children were missing, they said.
   The fire broke out about 5:30 a.m. in the two-story house in the
Bayswater section of Queens borough, and spread to a second alarm
before being brought under control shortly before 7 a.m.
   ``Apparently it was a well-advanced fire before units arrived,''
said Deputy Fire Chief John Hart.
   Firefighters who went inside the house ``found one body just
inside the door and three bodies up on the second floor,'' he said.
   A search was under way inside the house for the missing
children, he said.
   Four people inside the house were injured, one possibly
seriously, said Capt. Mark Rothstein of the Emergency Medical
Service, and one firefighter suffered minor injuries.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz flew to
Egypt after a final and apparently unsuccessful meeting today with
Israel's prime minister. He declared that his Middle East peace
initiative nevertheless was ``intact and alive.''
   The stop in Cairo primarily was a courtesy call on President
Hosni Mubarak, who played a leading role in shaping Shultz's
proposal for Arab-Israeli negotiations and is the only regional
leader to endorse it.
   Mubarak has insisted, however, on a direct role in the talks for
the PLO, which Shultz has ruled out.
   In a statement to reporters moments before he left Israel for
Egypt, Shultz said he made some progress but ``the differences
haven't been substantially narrowed.''
   ``There's no masking the deep-seated obstacles to peace,''
Shultz said at Ben Gurion airport. ``Emotions are deeply felt,
principles are proudly held, great traditions, cultures, and rights
are involved ... But with a serious commitment to work, it can
happen.''
   Shultz made an emotional appeal to Israeli and Arab leaders to
``say yes'' to his peace initiative, which he pledged to continue
despite the difficulties.
   ``The initiative we have discussed so intensively and thoroughly
over these past weeks is intact and alive,'' he said. ``Its
integrity, strength and balance and fairness are evident and
unchanged. It is there for the taking.''
   After talks with Mubarak, Shultz was scheduled to travel to
Amman, Jordan, to continue talks with King Hussein. His Middle East
trip will also take him to Saudi Arabia.
   Shultz expressed satisfaction with his talks with Hussein, who
he said posed many questions about the American plan, ``thus
indicating a serious engagement in the search for peace.''
   Earlier today, Shultz held final meetings with Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``When you are down in the trenches doing it, you certainly are
aware of how hard it is,'' Shultz said after seeing Shamir. ``But
that doesn't lessen the importance of continuing the effort.''
   Shultz returned to Israel Tuesday night from a 15-hour trip to
Jordan and Syria, where he sounded out Arab leaders on the peace
plan.
   Shamir aide Avi Pazner said Shultz told Shamir he had not
received a clear answer to his peace plan from Hussein, who
requested clarifications from the Israelis. Pazner quoted Shultz as
saying President Hafez Assad of Syria was ``negative'' about the
plan.
   Shamir said Shultz would not return to Jerusalem on his current
shuttle. But Israel radio quoted Foreign Ministry officials as
saying they did not rule out the possibilty of Shultz's returning
Saturday ``if he has something to discuss.''
   Returning from Jordan and Syria on Tuesday, Shultz said: ``I
cannot report any particular sense of convergence on our initiative
at this point.'' But he said all sides had urged him to continue.
   The U.S. initiative calls for negotiations in two stages. The
first would seek to establish some self-rule for Palestinians who
live in the Israeli occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The second
would deal with the settlement of the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Four months of anti-occupation rioting in the occupied lands
have left more than 135 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead.
Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
   In an interview in Amman on Tuesday with a group of Jordanian
editors, Shultz said a total Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
was not ``in the cards.''
   He opposed a separate role in the negotiations for the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which he said called in its covenant for
Israel's extermination. And, he said, an independent Palestinian
state on the West Bank would not be viable economically and did not
``make sense.''
   Shultz said the ethnic aspirations of Palestinians should be
taken into account: ``We seek some workable way these interests can
be served.''
   At the same time, he said negotations must be based on U.N.
Security Council resolutions that call on Israel to yield territory
captured in the 1967 war in exchange for peace.
   Without explanation, the interview was not shown on Jordanian
television Tuesday night.
   Shultz said Tuesday that both Shamir and Peres were prepared to
hold negotiations with Jordan on an overall settlement.
   ``But there are all sorts of questions,'' Shultz said,
especially on how negotiations on Palestinian self-rule would be
linked to dealing with an overall settlement.
   ``I don't want to give any big plus sign because that would not
be warranted by the facts,'' Shultz said.
   Damascus Radio said Assad made four demands in connection with a
peace settlement, including complete Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied lands and establishment of a Palestinian state.

<HEAD>Laxalt Gets Partial Award of Legal Fees In Suit Against Newspaper
Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Sen. Paul Laxalt says an award
of nearly $650,000 in legal costs makes him the victor in a more
than four-year libel battle against McClatchy Newspapers.
   ``The public knows well that winners aren't ordered to fork over
hundreds of thousands of dollars, and no amount of distortion by
the Bee (newspaper) regarding today's decision will dispel that
basic fact,'' Laxalt said in a statement issued in Washington.
   ``This should prove that it is not impossible for a public
servant to win the good fight against a wealthy and powerful
newspaper chain.''
   The award, announced Monday, marks the end of a protracted legal
battle that began in November 1983 when the Bee newspapers in
Sacramento, Modesto and Fresno published an article about the
family of Laxalt, a longtime confidante of President Reagan and
then a Republican senator from Nevada.
   The article alleged that the Internal Revenue Service had
evidence of skimming at the Ormsby House hotel-casino in Carson
City, Nev. while the Laxalt family owned it in the early 1970s.
   The action was dropped in June 1987, and the two sides then
entered arbitration over fees, with Laxalt's side requesting
approximately $4.3 million in fees and costs. The three-member
panel _ Griffin B. Bell, Charles B. Renfrew and Philip W. Tone _
entered their award last Thursday for $647,454 in fees and costs,
which will be paid by McClatchy's insurance carrier.
   The award also provides that $130,363 in fees and expenses for
the arbitrators will be shared by both parties.
   McClatchy Newspapers said in a statement it would have preferred
its insurance company not pay any of the fees, but called the award
``fair to all parties.''
   ``We are pleased that this long legal battle is finally over,
but let's hope its lessons are not forgotten,'' the publishing
company said in a statement. ``The First Amendment is meaningless
without a strong, independent and vigilant press willing to stand
up for its beliefs.''
   ``It's a hell of a victory,'' said attorney James Beasley, who
represented Laxalt. ``That's over half a million in counsel fees
that Laxalt doesn't have to pay. You only pay counsel fees to the
winner.''
   The Laxalt Libel Defense Fund already has paid $680,000 in legal
fees related to the case, according to Laxalt's daughter, Michelle,
who runs a political consulting firm in Washington, D.C. McClatchy
Newspapers is not required to pay reimbursement for those costs.

   Two men fled from a laundry after their
gasoline-soaked clothes caused an explosion in a washing machine,
and the laundry manager's hair was singed when the machine exploded
again while he tried to drain it.
   ``They probably just didn't know any better. It was just a
stupid thing to do,'' said Charles G. Lloyd, manager of White Star
Laundry & Cleaners.
   He said the garments appeared to be those of painters. He said
the men may have used gasoline to remove paint from the clothes
before washing them and he doesn't think they meant to endanger
anybody.
   Lloyd said he was sitting in his office Monday when he heard a
boom, and he saw two men running out the door, one of them with
singed hair. He said five to 10 people were washing their clothes
at the time in the coin-operated laundry.
   ``I assumed the guy had been hurt; I didn't think they were
running away,'' Lloyd said.
   Then Lloyd found that the five machines the men had been using
reeked of gasoline.
   ``I opened the lid and you could smell the fumes,'' Lloyd said.
``You could see the gasoline floating on top of the water.''
   A few minutes later, Lloyd was trying to drain the water from
the machines when fumes from the machine he was standing in front
of ignited.
   ``It singed my eyebrows and hair. I've got some blisters on my
cheeks,'' he said. Several machines were damaged and the laundry's
front window shattered, Lloyd said.
   Fire investigator J.C. Wilson said investigators are looking for
the man who loaded the clothes, just to make sure he isn't hurt and
to warn him of the danger of gasoline.
   ``But I'm pretty sure he knows now,'' Wilson said.

   Iraqi gunners fired four rockets into
Tehran during this morning's rush hour, and Iran said 16 people
were killed. Earlier, Iraqi warplanes blasted a supertanker near an
Iranian oil complex in the Persian Gulf.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said six children
were among those killed when four rockets hit Iran's capital at the
same time. It said ``many'' others were wounded and that a hospital
and nursery school were hit.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said 15 other civilians were killed
in Iraqi air raids on six towns in the southeasetern Khuzestan
province.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said four missiles were fired
into Tehran, ``the nest of hypocrites and charlatans,'' at 9:29
a.m. (1:29 a.m. EDT).
   It was one of the heaviest single barrages on the Iranian
capital since the so-called ``war of the cities'' was rekindled
Feb. 29. Since then, Iraq has been pounding the Iranian capital
with missiles, usually firing only one or two at a time.
   The Iraqi agency said Basra and the Umm Qasr port cities were
hit with missiles and artillery during the night. It said one
missile hit an elementary school in Umm Qasr, killing three
students and wounding 50 other children and teachers.
   The agency also quoted a military spokesman as saying Iraqi jets
attacked ``a very large maritime target,'' a usual reference to a
supertanker, off Sheik Sho'eyb, which is more commonly known as
Lavan Island. There was no immediate independent confirmation of
the air raid, which apparently occurred Tuesday night.
   Lavan island is a key offshore Iranian terminal for underwater
pipelines from central gulf oilfields of Rostam and Sassan. It lies
450 miles south of the main Iran-Iraq battle ground which is at the
northern edge of the gulf.
   The unidentified Iraqi spokesman said the Iraqi warplanes
``dealt an accurate and effective'' to the vessel off Lavan.
   He said the attack was ``a part of Iraq's continuous effort to
cut off the criminal Iranian regime's oil supplies.'' Iran depends
on a tanker fleet to shuttle its oil through the gulf under the
threat of Iraqi attacks.
   Iraq has safer outlets for its oil exports, which both countries
badly need to finance their costly war, now 7{ years old. Iraqi oil
is shipped through piplines across Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported its gunners fired two missiles
into Tehran on Tuesday, two into the holy city of Qom and one into
Isfahan in central Iran.

<HEAD>NAACP Members From Neighboring States Say They'll Protest
Confederate Flag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENID, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NAACP members in four neighboring states have
offered to march with Oklahomans in protest if the Confederate flag
flies again at the Oklahoma Capitol, the state president of the
organization said.
   Roy Carter of Enid, 93 miles north of Oklahoma City, said
executive committees and members of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People in New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana
and Arkansas offered to march at the Oklahoma Capitol and in their
own states.
   ``We are also soliciting a coalition of other groups to
participate,'' Carter said.
   On Tuesday, Gov. Henry Bellmon signed a joint resolution
requiring the Confederate flag be flown over the Capitol but said
the flagpole will remain empty until the Legislature tells him
which of three flags used by the Confederacy from 1861 to 1865 they
want.
   Black legislators had opposed the resolution, saying the
Confederate flag was a symbol of racism and slavery and had been
used by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.
   ``They fly it, we're marching,'' Carter said.
   The flag has sparked controversy in several other Southern
states recently. In Georgia, legislators have introduced a bill to
redesign the state flag, which incorporates the design of the
Confederate banner, and in Alabama, black lawmakers were arrested
for trying to remove a Confederate flag from the Capitol dome.
   For years, the Stars and Bars flag used by the Confederacy until
1863 was part of a 14-flag display south of the Capitol steps, but
the Office of Public Affairs removed the flags during recent
renovations.
   The flag display represents the countries that have claimed a
portion of Oklahoma territory in the past, including France and
Spain. Bellmon has said the existence of the Confederacy and its
control over a portion of Oklahoma are undisputed facts, and the
display is in historical context.

<HEAD>Police Search Trading Firms For Illegal Exports To China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police searched two trading firms after the
government accused the companies of exporting high-technology
measurement equipment to China between 1985 and 1986 without
obtaining permission.
   The searches were conducted Tuesday at Kyokuto Shokai, homes of
the firm's executives, and Shinsei Koeki, a Tokyo Metropolitan
Police official said.
   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry charged Monday
that both firms violated the nation's Foreign Exchange and Foreign
Trade law by exporting high-technology equipment without obtaining
permission, the official said.
   Seiji Murata, chief of MITI's export division, said Kyokuto
Shokai exported to China five digital memory devices, an
oscilloscope and one signal analyzer worth a total of $276,000
between June 1985 and June 1986.
   Shinsei Koeki is accused of shipping two sets of the digital
memory devices worth $113,000 to China between August 1986 and
November 1986.
   The memory devices are used to gauge the intensity of an
earthquake, but can have military applications, Murata said. An
oscilloscope is used to test microwave communications, while the
signal analyzer is used to pin down the source of noise. Both items
can also be applied for military purposes, he added.
   Officials of the two firms could not be reached Tuesday despite
repeated telephone calls.

   Michael Dukakis, calling his overwhelming
Wisconsin victory over Jesse Jackson a sign that voters think he
has ``the strength and the experience'' to be president, said today
another win in New York's primary could clear his path to the
Democratic nomination.
   Jackson insisted that despite twin losses to Dukakis in
Wisconsin and Colorado ``at this stage of the campaign, I feel very
good.''
   The Massachusetts governor won his first Midwestern primary on
the strength of the blue-collar vote Tuesday, helping to ease
doubts about his appeal even as it was raising questions about
Jackson's ability to turn his enthusiastic crowds into success at
the polls.
   Wisconsin also rang the closing bell for Paul Simon's campaign,
giving the Illinois senator a last-place finish. Simon was at home
today in Washington to reassess his campaign and aides said he
would make a statement Thursday.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. spent heavily but remained an also-ran in
third place. Just as Simon did here, Gore has put all his chips on
the New York primary on April 19.
   In Atlanta today, party chief Paul Kirk was asked if he felt
relief that Dukakis had won and set aside at least temporarily the
question of a Jackson ticket in the fall. ``Not relief,'' Kirk
replied. ``I was impressed with the results of the Dukakis
campaign.''
   Kirk said Jackson enjoyed heavy media coverage after his win in
Michigan and Dukakis had shown ``toughness to stick to the issues.''
   ``The people looked at us and made a decision as to who they
thought had the strength and the experience and the values to lead
this country ... Fortunately, I was on top,'' Dukakis said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``I hope I can do the same in New York. I
believe I can and go on and win the nomination.''
   Jackson, who appeared on ``CBS This Morning,'' congratulated
Dukakis for running ``a good, effective campaign'' in Wisconsin,
but noted his own strong showings to date.
   ``Of 40 contests that have been run now, I've come in No. 1 or
No. 2 in 30 of them and I have 250,000-plus popular vote lead and
so at this stage of the campaign I feel very good.''
   The New York contest puts the spotlight on Gov. Mario Cuomo, who
has often been mentioned as a potential draft at a deadlocked
convention. But Dukakis' win is likely to tone down talk of
drafting Cuomo or another Democrat.
   The New York governor has not made an endorsement, but the
Dukakis camp is hoping the Wisconsin win could put Dukakis in a
good position to finally win the nod from his fellow governor.
   There was a Republican primary in Wisconsin, but there were no
doubts. Vice President George Bush, the nomination his in
everything but name, bested Pat Robertson by a 10-1 margin.
   In the Democratic battle, Wisconsin gave Dukakis the boost he
had to have and perhaps pointed to a ceiling on Jackson's support.
   ``I hope it's a sign of things to come,'' said Dukakis of what
he called ``a great victory.''
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Dukakis had 481,857
or 48 percent, to 285,575 or 28 percent for Jackson. Gore had
176,009 for 17 pecent, while Simon drew only 48,877 about 5 percent.
   Dukakis edged Jackson among blue-collar workers, network exit
polls said, and won white union workers outright. That was good
news for the Massachusetts governor, who needed to show he can win
that group, which is key to the party's hopes in the fall.
   Even in Kenosha County, home of the doomed Chrysler plant where
Jackson had made a splash by joining the picket line, Dukakis won
with better than a 2-1 margin.
   ``I'm doing very well with working families ... because people
see in me someone who doesn't just talk about jobs,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor also won in Colorado's precinct
caucuses, which were held Monday, even though the counting dragged
into Tuesday.
   With 77 percent counted, Dukakis won with 44 percent to
Jackson's 37 percent. Uncommitted groups took 16 percent and Gore 3
percent.
   In the Republican caucuses in Colorado, Bush won easily over
Robertson.
   Dukakis's campaign was in serious trouble after Jackson's
stunning victory in the March 26 caucuses. But he has now won three
of four events in the past eight days _ adding Wisconsin and
Colorado to his Connecticut primary win. Jackson won the Virgin
Islands caucuses over the weekend.
   ``This is going to be a 15-round bout and it will be by a
decision ... there's no such thing as a knockout punch,'' Dukakis
said.
   The delegate numbers showed why the Democratic race could
continue to drag on. Dukakis moved ahead, but the party's rules
splitting the delegates up among the top finishers kept Jackson
close.
   Despite his victory margin, Dukakis picked up on 43 delegates in
Wisconsin to 26 for Jackson. Gore won 12.
   In Colorado, Dukakis picked up 21 national convention delegates
and Jackson 17. The other seven are uncommitted.
   That, plus partial Wisconsin results, left the AP delegate count
this way: Dukakis 735.55; Jacksn, 706.55; Gore 394.8; Simon, 170.5;
and uncommitted 516.6. A total of 2,082 votes are need to win at
the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   Tuesday's results give Dukakis the momentum going into the New
York primary, where 255 delegates are stake in the biggest single
state thus far. Then comes the Pennsylvania primary, where the
rules could allow Dukakis to win the lion's share of the delegates,
on April 26.
   Perhaps equally important, his victories this week give Dukakis
new, stronger arguments to make to the senators and representatives
who will be chosen as super delegates the same week as the New York
primary.
   With the pledged delegate count still close, the verdict of the
unpledged super delegates _ governors, Democratic National
Committee members and members of Congress _ could provide the
numbers to give Dukakis a majority.
   Jackson vowed to press on. ``I'm a long distance runner,'' he
said.

   Syrian-allied Moslem militiamen struck
back today at forces supported by Iran in a second day of fierce
gunbattles in south Lebanon. Police said 12 people were killed and
34 wounded.
   It was the heaviest fighting in the region between Justice
Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia, which is allied with Syria,
and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The two Shiite Moslem groups have been struggling for control of
south Lebanon. Relations have rapidly deteriorated since Feb. 17
when Amal captured dozens of Hezbollah members and linked them to
the abduction of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. Hezbollah
has denied involvement.
   Lebanon's most influential Shiite cleric, Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, called on both sides to lay down their weapons.
   ``We prohibit this fighting because it burns Islam's causes and
the Moslems,'' Fadlallah said.
   The battles, which started Tuesday near the inland market town
of Nabatiyeh, today spread to the port of Tyre and surrounding
villages, police said.
   In today's bloodiest clash, Amal militiamen fought Hezbollah
fighters in Nabatiyeh before dawn and recaptured three offices lost
late Tuesday, said a police spokesman who insisted on anonymity.
Six people were killed and 17 injured.
   Amal militiamen also stormed Hezbollah positions in the village
of Siddiqine, 8 miles southeast of Tyre, killing one person and
wounding four.
   The duel started Tuesday when Hezbollah gunmen attacked an Amal
checkpoint near Nabatiyeh, killing an Amal militiaman.
   Relations between the two groups unraveled after Hezbollah said
Amal was ``harassing the believers by seaching for an American
spy.''
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was serving as chief U.N.
observer in the area when he was kidnapped Feb. 17. His abduction
has been claimed by the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, a
pro-Iranian underground group believed to be affiliated with
Hezbollah.
   Hezbollah, whose members are loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, is believed to be an umbrella group for pro-Iranian
underground factions holding most of the 22 foreigners missing and
believed kidnapped in Lebanon since 1985.
   The hostage held the longest is Associated Press chief Middle
East correspondent Terry Anderson. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   An Israeli girl and two
Palestinians were killed in a clash today between Israeli civilians
and Arabs in a West Bank village, Israel radio and other sources
said.
   The radio said the dead girl was in a group of Israeli tourists
in Beita, a village near Nablus. It said three Israeli children
were injured.
   Arab sources said the Israelis were settlers.
   The Palestinians, identified by hospital officials as Mousa
Saleh Abu Shamseh, 20, and Hatem Fayez Al Jabr, 22, died in a clash
with Jewish settlers while working in their fields at Beita, Arab
reports said.
   Both were shot in the head during a clash at Beita, officials at
Al Ittihad Hospital said. They said two other Palestinians were
seriously wounded.
   Before today, U.N. reports listed 138 Palestinians as being
killed by Israelis since unrest broke out in the occupied
territories on Dec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been killed.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in the Middle East to
promote a peace plan aimed at settling the Arab-Israeli dispute,
met today with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres. Shultz acknowledged he did not win needed support for
the peace initiative but vowed to continue his efforts.
   Shultz went to Jordan and Syria on Tuesday to discuss the peace
plan. Later, he said he could not report any progress.
   In the West Bank today, the army took over the homes of six Arab
families east of Nablus for 10 days, forcing them to live in tents,
Israel radio said. The army earlier had converted about a dozen
Arab schools into military bases and used some as temporary
detention centers.
   In Gaza City, troops ordered Arab passers-by to paint over
slogans proclaiming ``No to Shultz'' and ``Shultz Go Away''
scrawled on shop walls, an Arab shopowner said.
   In the morning, troops forced stores and vegetable markets shut
in Gaza City, in the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza and in the West
Bank city of Ramallah. Protest leaders have ordered merchants to
stay open in the morning and observe a strike in the afternoons.
   In Jabaliya, the soldiers' orders prompted a brief clash between
stone-throwing refugees and troops firing tear gas, Arab witnesses
said. In Gaza City, Arabs sold produce on street corners near the
market area, running away when troops appeared, the witnesses said.
   In Gaza on Tuesday, an Arab teen-ager lost his left eye after
being hit by a rubber bullet fired by troops, and soldiers wounded
a second Arab youth in a separate clash, the army said.
   In Jerusalem, a group of Israelis who have been hurt in
Palestinian terror attacks held a vigil in front of the hotel where
Shultz was staying. They said the secretary's peace mission rewards
Arab violence.
   ``Shultz's visit is like oil on the fire of terror,'' said
reserve Gen. Yehoshua Sagi, former head of army intelligence.
   Israeli soldiers on Tuesday foiled an attempt by Palestinian
guerrillas to cross the northern border about 100 yards from the
Israeli settlement Kfar Yuval, the army said.
   Troops exchanged fire with the guerrillas, who were armed with
Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher
and about a dozen hand grenades, army officials said.
   Two guerrillas were killed and a third was captured. Four
soldiers were wounded.
   Two groups affiliated with the Palestine Liberation Organization
claimed responsibility for the infiltration attempt: Fatah, headed
by PLO chief Yasser Arafat, and the pro-Syrian Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine.

   A windsurfer out on Lake Michigan to enjoy the
unseasonably warm weather saved a boy from the choppy water, but a
second child was missing today, police said.
   The rescued boy, 11-year-old Michael Evans, was one of two
children on an inflatable raft that was pushedaway from shore by
high winds and waves Tuesday afternoon.
   Missing was 10-year-old Denise Taylor. Divers called off their
search for her when darkness fell, and winds gusting to 50 mph this
morning prevented them from resuming the search, police said.
   Crews are checking the lakeshore and will go out onto the lake
as soon as winds subside, Officer LeRoy Marcianik said.
   Perry Tulk, 30, of Chicago said as he arrived at Montrose Beach
to windsurf he ``noticed someone was in a rubber raft tht was way
out,'' but as he was setting up his board he saw that they had
jumped off and were fighting to swim toward shore.
   Tulk said he fell into the water twice on the way out to the
children because the wind was ``screaming.''
   ``I saw the closest one to me go under water, so I jumped off my
board and grabbed him,'' Tulk said in a telephone interview Tuesday
night. ``I could see him bobbing completely under water _ I figured
he was about to cash it in.''
   Tulk said he told the boy to hold tightly to the straps on the
board.
   ``He looked like a frozen mouse,'' he said. ``All he was wearing
was a pair of shorts.''
   Temperatures in Chicago on Tuesday reached 85 degrees, but the
lake temperature was only about 40 degrees.
   Tulk said he was struggling to paddle toward shore when a
helicopter arrived on the scene, and a diver helped them to the
beach.
   Michael was in fair condition at Children's Memorial Hospital,
said Kathy Canick, a nursing superviser. ``The boy is called a near
drowning and he's in for observation,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A judge held A.C. Nielsen Co. in contempt of
court today and fined the television rating company $500 a day for
failing to turn over ratings of Atlanta newscasts sought by
attorneys in a murder retrial.
   Attorneys for Wayne Carl Coleman had sought the ratings
information as a basis for motions to delay or move Coleman's
retrial for the 1973 slayings of six members of the Alday family in
southwest Georgia's Seminole County.
   Defense attorney Tom West said he wants to use the ratings of
local television news programs to show how widely the Alday case
has been publicized in DeKalb County.
   Jury selection began Monday for the retrial, which was moved
from Seminole County to DeKalb County in suburban Atlanta.
   Superior Court Judge Hugh Lawson ruled Nielsen in willful
contempt of court and said he was concerned that its refusal to
produce the information would ``cause real problems in the
prosecution of this case.''
   Nielsen attorney Bernard Rosenthal told Lawson the Chicago-based
company regretted not being able to produce the material, but said
complying with the subpoena would disrupt Nielsen's business by
making it compile information that is not already available.
   He also said it would present a continual threat of requests in
similar trials.
   Rosenthal said Nielsen would appeal immediately to the Georgia
Supreme Court.
   Coleman was one of three Maryland prison escapees convicted of
murder and sentenced to death in Seminole County for the slayings
of Ned Alday, his brother, his three sons and his daughter-in-law.
   In 1985, a federal appeals court threw out the convictions of
Coleman, his half-brother Carl Isaacs and George Elder Dungee on
grounds that pretrial publicity made a fair trial impossible in
Seminole County.
   Isaacs was retried in Houston County earlier this year and was
again convicted and sentenced to death. Dungee is to be tried later
in Muscogee County.
   Lawson is presiding at all three trials.

   The highest-ranking East German official to
visit the United States will hold talks with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz next month, an East German diplomat said today.
   Hermann Axen, member of the Politburo and party Central
Committee with responsibility for foreign affairs, was invited to
give a lecture at the Johns-Hopkins University Institute for
Contemporary German Studies on May 4 and will meet Shultz the day
before.
   Axen will speak to the National Press Club and meet members of
Congress.
   The two countries established diplomatic ties in 1974, but
relations have remained cool because U.S. officials regard
communist East Germany as one of the Soviet Union's staunchest
allies and have found the country among the least responsive to
U.S. pleas to improve human rights conditions.
   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, who met East German
leaders in Berlin last year, was the highest-ranking American
official to visit East Germany.
   ``The main intention of these talks will be to promote the
relationship between both countries and contribute to a further
buildup of the relationship,'' said the East German diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said Axen would spend a brief time in New York during the
trip.

   Alan Paton, the country's best
known author, was recovering today from surgery for an undisclosed
ailment, a press report said.
   Paton, whose 1948 novel ``Cry, The Beloved Country'' drew a
compelling picture of South Africa's apartheid system of racial
segregation, was in ``fairly serious condition'' after Tuesday's
operation, according to an unidentified heart surgeon quoted by the
South African Press Association.
   A spokeswoman at St. Augustine's Hospital in Durban said today
that Paton was in stable condition.
   The 85-year-old novelist underwent surgery after being admitted
to the Durban hospital Monday, the news agency said.
   Paton's ``Cry, The Beloved Country'' is the second best-selling
book ever in South Africa after the Bible.
   Paton worked in anti-apartheid politics for many years with the
United Party and still contributes political commentary to South
African newspapers.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A railroad worker was killed and two
others injured when two empty commuter trains collided this
morning, authorities said, halting all service on Metro North's New
Haven line at the height of the rush hour.
   An eight-car Metro North train crashed into the rear of a
five-car train which was stopped about one mile west of the Mount
Vernon station north of New York City, said Mount Vernon police Lt.
John O'Brien.
   The dead worker was believed to be the engineer of the eight-car
train, authorities said. His body was trapped inside the motorman's
compartment of the lead car, which was catapulted into overhead
electrical wires on impact and came to rest atop the last car of
the other train.
   Metro North spokesman Dan Brucker said 28,900 commuters use the

   A federal judge denied a request by
jurors for a trial transcript, telling them to rely on memory and
notes while deliberating in the case of 13 white supremacists,
including nine accused of sedition.
   Deliberations were delayed today because one of the jurors has a
sick child. U.S. District Judge Morris Arnold said juror Harold C.
Whittenburg went to a hospital to see about his baby and that the
third day of deliberations was postponed until he could rejoin the
jury.
   Nine defendants are charged with conspiring to overthrow the
government by violence, and one of them, along with four other
defendants, is charged with conspiring to kill a federal judge and
an FBI agent. Two of the sedition defendants are accused of the
interstate transportation of stolen money.
   In denying three jurors' requestion for the transcript Tuesday,
Arnold said the document would be 7,000 pages long and would not be
ready for three or four months. He also denied their request to
re-hear lengthy portions of testimony.
   The government called 113 witnesses and the defense had 79 in
the trial which began Feb. 16.
   The case went to the jury Monday afternoon and lawyers,
defendants and others waited at the federal courthouse on Tuesday.
   One defendant, Bruce Carroll Pierce, is serving a 150-year
sentence for violating the civil rights of Denver radio talk show
host Alan Berg by killing him, and 100 years on a Seattle
conviction for racketeering.
   Defendant Robert E. Miles, free on $50,000 bond, said he would
have attended the trial even if he were not a defendant. ``I
wouldn't have missed it for the world,'' he said. ``This is where
the devil is. This is evil personified, the whole crew.''
   Defendant Richard G. Butler said the trial is a move by the
government to snuff out views that do not meet government approval.
He said he expects to be acquitted, ``but in any case, they win:
They break us financially.''
   Butler, Miles and Louis Ray Beam Jr., who also is on trial and
is being held without bond, are considered three of the top leaders
of the white-supremacist movement in the United States.
   But one of Beam's lawyers, Kirk Lyons of Houston, said Butler,
Beam and Miles are ``through fighting. Miles is 63. Butler is 70.
Beam has got a 20-year-old wife.''
   Acquittal would slow the movement, Lyons said, because it would
show that white supremacists ``can get a fair trial in American
courts.''
   The sedition defendants face up to 20 years in prison and a
$20,000 fine if convicted. The murder charge carries a maximum of
life imprisonment and the interstate transportation charges have a
maximum term of 10 years and a $10,000 fine.
   The government also contends that some of the defendants
committed a series of robberies to finance their activities. The
robberies netted about $4.1 million, of which about $1 million is
unaccounted for, the government said.
   The key government witness, James Ellison, testified that the
white supremacist group he led in Arkansas carried out bombings to
advance a conspiracy begun in July 1983 at Hayden Lake, Idaho, at
an Aryan Nations conference.
   Ellison is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Defendants who
attended the 1983 meeting have said that there was no conspiracy
and that Ellison has made up the story in hopes of getting a
sentence reduction.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is trying to
fill a key Justice Department post left vacant by a protest
resignation, after settling for his second choice for the
department's No. 2 post.
   Meese announced Tuesday that he is recommending former American
Bar Association president John C. Shepherd for the No. 2 job. He
also said he has chosen Treasury Department enforcement chief
Francis A. Keating for the department's No. 3 position, which had
opened before six protest resignations rocked the department last
week.
   Still unfilled is the job of head of the department's criminal
division.
   The choices announced Tuesday drew support from the ranking
Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Strom Thurmond
of South Carolina last week had conveyed congressional concern to
Meese over problems at the Justice Department in the wake of the
protest resignations by Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns,
Assistant Attorney General William Weld of the criminal division,
and four of their aides.
   Meese said he had notified several members of Congress about his
choices ahead of time, but Thurmond, a member of the committee that
will hold confirmation hearings on Shepherd and Keating, pointedly
stated that Meese had not advised him in advance.
   Burns and Weld resigned out of concern that the nearly 11-month
criminal investigation of Meese by independent counsel James C.
McKay was hurting the department's operations and image.
   Shepherd was Meese's second choice to replace Burns, after
former federal appeals judge Arlin Adams of Philadelphia turned it
down, citing a heavy private caseload.
   Keating, a former FBI agent, would fill the post vacated by
Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott, who is leaving the
department to become a federal appeals court judge.
   Thurmond said of Shepherd and Keating, ``From what I now know
about these two fine individuals, I look forward to supporting
their confirmation.''
   Meese said he probably will announce a recommended replacement
for Weld after returning from a week-long trip to South America to
discuss drugs with officials in several countries.
   A Justice Department source said Salvatore R. Martoche, now an
assistant secretary in the Labor Department, had rejected a request
from Meese to take Weld's job, assistant attorney general in charge
of the criminal division.
   Martoche decided not to take the job ``because of the taint
factor'' relating to the continuing criminal investigation of
Meese, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Meese declined to say whether he had offered Martoche the job,
but said he had spoken to a number of people about it.
   Keating was asked whether he had had second thoughts about
accepting his appointment.
   ``Certainly the events of last week made me, as a professional,
pause,'' he said. ``But I have every confidence in the leadership
of the department and the attorney general. I think with our new
team here the operation of the department will continue.''
   Shepherd said he had no reservations about taking the job in the
wake of Burns' protest resignation. But Shepherd did acknowledge
Meese's continuing legal problems, saying ``we all see that.''
   The White House allowed Meese to proceed with the replacements,
despite a lack of completed FBI background checks. The move was an
attempt to quell questions about Meese's ability to lead the
department effectively in the aftermath of the Burns-Weld
resignations.
   Shepherd and Keating will begin serving shortly on an acting
basis until after their nomination by President Reagan and Senate
confirmation. Burns and Trott will stay on while Meese is in South
America.
   Such nominations normally are announced by the president, but
Meese was allowed to announce them at a Justice Department news
conference after checking with White House chief of staff Howard
Baker.
   Shepherd, who is 62, was ABA president in 1984-85 and is a
partner in a St. Louis law firm. Meese said he ``will be a highly
distinguished and most welcome addition to the Justice Department.''
   Meese said Keating, 44, the assistant Treasury secretary for
enforcement, ``can hit the ground running'' in the Justice
Department's work combating illegal drugs.

   Two Wheaton College students missing for four
days may be on a secret honeymoon, say authorities, who are
appealing to the newlyweds to confirm their safety with a call to
their parents.
   Carolyn MacLean, 22, of Haddonfield, N.J., and Scott Swanson,
23, of the west Chicago suburb of Elgin, who were married secretly
March 23, disappeared Saturday. A $35,000 BMW the couple was
driving was discovered in a downtown alley with the engine running,
police said.
   Cmdr. Ettore Di Vito of the Chicago Police Department's Youth
Division said Tuesday that police are hoping some ``personal
things'' they discovered while going through the car would help
them find the couple. In a televised interview, he urged the couple
to contact their parents.
   The couple were expected at the home of Swanson's parents
Saturday night. The parents last heard from the couple by telephone
Friday afternoon. But despite news coverage and the widespread
display of posters with their pictures, they had not contacted
police or their families as of Tuesday.
   ``They're on their honeymoon. They might not have seen the
papers,'' Officer Ronald Mohrs said.
   Police said earlier that an attendant at a Northwest Side gas
station and a few other Chicagoans have reported seeing the couple.
   The attendant, Peter Youkhanna, said he spoke with the missing
couple about 2 a.m. Monday and ``they were happy.''
   The couple asked him if any nightclubs in the area were still
open, and when Youkhanna told them everything was closed, they
called a taxi, Mohrs said.
   The couple were students at Wheaton College, a private Christian
school about 30 miles west of Chicago.

<HEAD>Oversight Panel Says Doctors' Dissent Must Stop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute between transplant specialists and
anesthesiologists at Children's Hospital has resulted in boycotts
of meetings and other conflicts, says an official of a transplant
oversight committee.
   The Very Rev. George Werner, vice chairman of the committee,
said Tuesday that the panel probably will discuss the controversy
at its April 14 meeting.
   Werner began investigating dissension at the hospital after
several internal memos criticizing its liver transplant program
were disclosed late last month. The memos were released by Maria
DeSillers, a Miami woman who is being sued by the hospital for not
paying her late son's medical bills.
   ``It is obvious that an institution which has internal memos
getting out on the street and personality clashes being made public
needs to look at its administration,'' Werner said.
   Mrs. DeSillers said she released the memos in hopes of spurring
a federal investigation of the hospital's liver transplant program.
Her 7-year-old son, Ronnie, died last year after three liver
transplants.
   Ms. DeSillers has refused to pay the $261,189 still owed the
hospital, saying her son received negligent care.
   The boy's plight generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in
donations from sympathetic Americans, including President Reagan.
Florida officials are investigating Ms. DeSillers' handling of the
money.
   The memos, some of which were written by Dr. D. Ryan Cook, an
anesthesiologist, spoke of confusion in the hospital's liver
transplant program. He also referred to ``growing distrust,
disillusionment and negativism.''
   ``Recently, we had two current transplants in which the donor
organs were switched about like peas under shells until no one
could easily recall which liver was to go into which patient,''
Cook wrote in a Feb. 2 letter to Dr. William Donaldson, the
hospital's medical director.
   Werner said both patients are doing well.
   ``Dr. Cook is using exciting language, but he really didn't look
at the results,'' Werner said. ``It seems that whoever moved on
this case did a good job.''
   Mortality rates for pediatric liver transplants are excellent,
Werner said. As of two weeks ago, 44 of 49 patients operated on
since August have survived, he said.
   Werner said, however, that the transplant surgeons who work
under the direction of transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl
occasionally act like ``cowboys'' in the hospital bureaucracy. The
surgeons sometimes ignore surgical schedules and expect
anesthesiologists to show up on short notice, he said.
   Werner chided the anesthesiologists for not attending the weekly
liver transplant reviews, when hospital staff members assign
priorities to the list of patients awaiting transplants.
   ``There didn't seem to be a chain of command so that the
anesthesiologists and transplant surgeons knew what was happening
with the scheduling and with the reviews,'' Werner said.
   ``What needs to be emphasized here is that this is a good
program, and what Dr. Cook will tell you, I'm sure, is that he
wants to make a good program better,'' Werner said.

   A 21-year-old woman led a daring rescue
of her cousin, who was locked in a closet by drug dealers and not
fed for six days because he owed $50 for cocaine, police said.
   The unidentified man was rescued from an apartment where he was
handcuffed and chained to the floor in a closet, police said
Tuesday.
   The woman, also not identified by police, was shot in the arm
when the dealers returned, found the front door locked and began
firing randomly into the apartment.
   The dealers fled after police responded to neighbors' reports of
gunshots.
   Oakland police Sgt. Jerry Aguirre said the man was ``scared and

the conditions of his captivity.

Contest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The movie ``Million Dollar
Mystery'' lost millions for the company that produced it, but it
has made a 14-year-old girl a millionaire.
   Alesia Lenae Jones, a sophomore at Bakersfield's North High
School, won $1 million for piecing together clues from the movie to
correctly guess where $1 million was supposed to be hidden.
   The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, which sponsored the
contest, announced Tuesday it will award her the prize April 14 at
the company's headquarters. She'll also be given a limousine tour
of Hollywood.
   Miss Jones won the ``Million Dollar Mystery'' Movie Sweepstakes
by correctly guessing that the money had been hidden in the bridge
of the Statue of Liberty's nose.
   She said she plans to buy a horse with her winnings and get
braces, as well as help her family buy a home. She'll then put the
rest of the money into a trust fund.
   ``Million Dollar Mystery,'' released in June 1987, was a box
office flop for De Laurentiis, one of a string of failures for the
financially troubled company. It wrote off $15.5 million, its
entire stake in the film.
   As part of a reorganization following the February resignation
of former chairman Dino De Laurentiis, the company decided to sell
foreign television, video and non-theatrical rights to its
320-movie library.

<NOTE>Eds: Adds 2 grafs on agencies with programs in Tigray and Eritrea.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today told
international relief agencies to recall all their foreign workers
from the war-torn northern regions of Tigray and Eritrea for
security reasons, a U.N. official said.
   The request was made in a two-page statement distributed to
relief agencies in Addis Ababa, the capital, by the Relief and
Rehabilitation Commission, the government agency responsible for
drought and famine relief in Ethiopia.
   ``The RRC notified relief agencies operating to recall to Addis
Ababa their expatriate staff to avoid personnel security risks,''
said David Morton, head of the World Food Program in Ethiopia.
``Donor agencies are advised to turn over their operations to the
RRC to guarantee the continuity of relief activities.''
   The order comes a week after President Mengistu Haile Mariam
told Ethiopians in a radio address that government troops were
facing a ``grim struggle'' against rebels in Eritrea and Tigray.
Mengistu said the government was mobilizing troops to crush the
long-time rebellions and appealed to his countrymen to give
``everything to the warfront.''
   Rebels have been fighting for 27 years in Eritrea, Africa's
longest civil war, and for 14 years in Tigray. The fighting has
disrupted relief efforts in both regions, where crop failures
threaten 3.5 million people with starvation.
   Morton said the statement did not give a deadline for withdrawal
of foreigners from the northern regions and the order did not apply
to Ethiopians working with the international agencies.
   The number of foreign relief workers affected by the order was
not immediately known.
   There are about 60 non-governmental relief organizations working
in Ethiopia, but only a few operate in Eritrea and Tigray.
   Those agencies operating in the war area include the
International Committee of the Red Cross, Medicins Sans Frontieres
of Belguim and Catholic Relief Services.

   A woman who pleaded guilty to shooting her
former psychologist and two members of his family was sentenced to
life in prison and ordered to pay her victims $10,000.
   ``You I believe are a dangerous person who should be locked up .
.. for as long as you remain a threat,'' Superior Court Judge David
A. Horowitz told Kimberly A. Gracyalny in sentencing her Tuesday.
   She will be eligible for parole in 10 to 11 years, said Deputy
District Attorney Sharon Matsumoto.
   Ms. Gracyalny wounded neuropsychology specialist David Fox, his
wife and daughter Dec. 20 as they returned to their home in the
Fairfax area about 10 miles west of downtown Los Angeles.
   She hid in the Fox family's front yard and opened fire with a
handgun, chasing them around the house to the back yard before the
couple was able to subdue her, authorities said.
   During the attack, Fox, 34, was shot in the arm, his wife
Deborah, 31, was shot in both legs and their 6-year-old daughter
was shot in the left leg. The couple's three sons, ages 9, 11 and
18 months, were uninjured.
   Fox asked that Ms. Gracyalny be given the maximum sentence.
   ``My wife has five bullet holes in her leg,'' Fox told the
judge. His 7-year-old daughter has a bullet lodged in her leg which
cannot be removed, and he has suffered nerve damage to one hand, he
said.
   ``The situation that my family and I have endured has gone
beyond that of vandalism and harassment. It can only be compared to
being held hostage in your own home,'' he said.
   Fox's eldest son, Abraham, 11, also asked that Ms. Gracyalny
receive the maximum term.
   ``We have been afraid to play in our own yard due to the
presence of Miss Gracyalny. We have also been afraid to walk to our
schools and synagogue,'' he said.
   Fox treated Ms. Gracyalny between November 1982 and March 1983
for an undisclosed problem. The patient began harassing the
therapist soon afterward, according to court records.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. brought his
presidential campaign to the voters here today, trying to turn to
his advantage a distant third-place finish in the Wisconsin primary.
   ``New York state has always been friendly to underdogs, and I'm
the underdog,'' Gore told reporters as he shook hands with
rush-hour commuters boarding the Staten Island ferry for Manhattan.
   Gore has not won a contest since his six victories on Super
Tuesday, March 8. He is campaigning and spending heavily in New
York, which holds a primary April 19, hoping to demonstrate that he
can prevail outside his native South.
   With 99 percent of Wisconsin precincts reporting, Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis had 48 percent of the vote to 28 percent for
Jesse Jackson and 17 percent for Gore.
   On Tuesday night, Gore said he had done much better than
expected and maintained the results portend a trend that will bring
voters to his camp.
   With Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois expected to suspend his
campaign Thursday, Gore proclaimed the bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination a three-man race.
   He minimized his recent criticism of Jackson, saying he has
spent the great majority of his time outlining his own political
agenda as opposed to attacking other candidates.
   Gore reiterated his strong support for Israel and said as
president he would create a Cabinet level position to focus on
Mideast negotiations full time, rather than the ``on-again,
off-again approach'' taken by the Reagan administration.
   He rejected the notion that he is targeting New York's large
Jewish population in the upcoming primary, saying ``I'm not putting
people in different categories. I'm campaigning for all the votes
here in this state.''

   Newspapers in Charlotte, N.C., Albuquerque,
N.M., and Boulder, Colo., have received 1987 National Journalism
Awards for public service from the Scripps Howard Foundation.
   Among newspapers with more than 100,000 daily circulation, The
Charlotte Observer won the Roy W. Howard Award for Public Service
Journalism for what the judges described as ``its unrelenting but
judicious expose of televangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker's
defrauding of contributors to their PTL (Praise the Lord) Club.''
   The paper also received a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the
PTL empire.
   There were dual winners of the public service award for
newspapers of less than 100,000 circulation in the awards announced
Tuesday. The Albuquerque Tribune won for coverage designed to
create community acceptance for a child disfigured by fire, and The
Boulder Daily Camera won for investigation of misuse of public
money at the Rocky Flats, Colo., nuclear weapons plant.
   The Ernie Pyle Award for Human Interest Reporting went to
columnist Steve Lopez of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   The Kentucky Post in Covington, Ky., across the Ohio River from
Cincinnati, won the Edward Willis Scripps Award for Service to the
First Amendment for articles on First Amendment issues, including
opposition to attempts to close courtrooms and deny access to
public records. Post Editor Judith Clabes also was cited for her
role in establishing a First Amendment Center at the University of
Kentucky.
   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette was the under 100,000 circulation
winner of the Edward J. Meeman Award for Environmental Journalism
for what judges said were ``insightful news stories, lively
features and crisp, fearless editorials'' focusing on environmental
issues in a jobs vs. the environment atmosphere in West Virginia.
   The environmental winner for newspapers of more than 100,000
circulation was The Seattle Times for writing and photography by
Natalie Fobes, explaining the wild salmon's struggle to survive.
   Maura J. Casey of The Eagle-Tribune in Lawrence, Mass., won the
Walker Stone Award for Editorial Writing. The judges said her
crusade ``led to reform of abuses in Massachusetts' prison furlough
system.'' The newspaper also got a Pulitzer for its coverage of the
issue.
   The newspaper winner of the Charles E. Scripps Literacy Award
was the Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader for a year-long campaign
involving news, editorial, advertising and other divisions of the
newspaper to educate the public about illiteracy and generate
action by government and private agencies.
   The broadcast literacy winner was the New Jersey Network for a
statewide effort to address the problem of illiteracy in New
Jersey. Judges said the network, a public television system,
``demonstrated both the great need for such attention and the
effective role to be played by broadcasters in the battle against
illiteracy.''
   Four stations won the Jack R. Howard Broadcast Awards for Public
Service Programming. They were KXTV, Sacramento, Calif., large
market television; WBRZ, Baton Rouge, La., small market television;
WSM, Nashville, Tenn., large market radio, and WWVA, Wheeling,
W.Va., small market radio.
   Michael A. Thompson, a senior at the University of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee, received the Charles M. Schulz Award for college
cartoonists.
   The 15 winners share $43,500 in cash prizes.

   Nearly 10,000 missing Social Security
checks have been found in Indianapolis, and Postal Service workers
rushed today to deliver the money to residents in six southern
Indiana counties.
   ``All the checks will be delivered today,'' said Evansville
Postmaster Ed Hayes.
   The missing checks were found around midnight in a trailer that
was thought to be empty, Hayes said. They were shipped to
Evansville and arrived about 5:45 a.m., he said.
   ``How they got to Indianapolis, I don't know,'' he said.
   The checks totaling nearly $3 million were delivered from the
U.S. Treasury's regional financial center in Kansas City, Kan., to
the main post office in Kansas City, Mo., according to Jack Adams,
director of the regional center.
   They were to be flown to Louisville, Ky., and then trucked to
Evansville. But they never made it to Kentucky and were no longer
in Missouri.
   Nineteen trays of checks were found in a truck trailer that had
been hired to run between Kansas City and Indianapolis, Hayes said.
   The Social Security office in Evansville fielded about 1,500
calls Tuesday from pensioners missing their checks, and 100 people
were waiting outside the office before it opened this morning, said
office manager Phillis France.
   ``This is the best possible thing that can happen, of course.
``We're just happy the checks were located,'' she said.
   About 400 replacement checks had already been ordered from the
Treasury, but she said she would try to cancel those requests.
   ``We're going to ask people to return the second check once they
receive it,'' she said.
   The postal service is investigating how the checks were lost.

   A potential juror in the cocaine trial of
John Zaccaro Jr. said she thought the press picked on his family
during the 1984 vice presidential candidacy of his mother,
Geraldine Ferraro.
   The woman was one of 15 candidates selected after painstaking
questioning of 25 people during jury selection, which resumed this
morning for a third day.
   Opening arguments were expected later today or Thursday. Twelve
jurors and two alternates are needed for the trial.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said the selection of
a jury was slowed by the publicity given the case and the fact
Ferraro is so well-known.
   ``Selecting a jury is probably the most important part of the
case,'' he said. Quinn said if even one juror bore a grudge, it
could influence the jury's verdict.
   Most of those questioned said they had read newspaper accounts
of the case since Zaccaro, 24, was charged in 1986 with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent.
   One potential juror said today that he would discount anything
he read in the newspapers though because of a basic distrust of the
press. ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just
because they have been charged,'' said Donald Cioffi.
   Only one person has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Zaccaro's mother could affect his view of the case.
   Jury pool member Joanne Cillo said Tuesday that she felt that
press treatment of Ferraro during the 1984 campaign carried over to
Zaccaro.
   ``I can't say I don't feel the press picked on these people,''
Cillo said when asked if she was pleased with how Ferraro has been
treated.
   She said her views would not interfere with her judgment if she
is chosen to hear the case. ``The press is not trying this case,''
she said. ``The issue is, did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   ``I don't believe it's up to me to make restitution for what the
press may or may not have done,'' she added.
   Zaccaro, then a senior at Middlebury College, pleaded innocent
to the charge. He has been accompanied to court each day by his
mother and father, John Zaccaro Sr.
   Ferraro, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers, taking
notes intently, but stopping when Cillo spoke about her family. At
that point she rested her head in her hand and looked down.
   She later declined to comment on the case, telling one reporter,
``It's nothing against you personally. We're just not answering
anything for anybody.''
   The start of Monday's trial came two years after her son was
arrested outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   Six reporters were allowed to watch the questioning, which was
briefly interrupted Monday when Judge Francis McCaffrey imposed and
then lifted a gag order on reporters covering jury selection.
   Defense lawyers sought the gag order for fear too many reporters
could intimidate potential jurors. But McCaffrey lifted it
following a challenge from reporters and an agreement to limit
their number in the courtroom.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the courts. Zaccaro's
attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and claimed
unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution because
of his mother.
   The Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the case.

throughout the nation.
   April 4
   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on Edwin Meese:
   When a high official's political foes call for his resignation,
he does well to ignore them. But when political friends urge him to
leave, he ought to pay attention.
   Unfortunately, Attorney General Edwin Meese insists on hanging
on to his job by his fingernails, despite well-intentioned advice
by respected associates that he no longer can fulfill his important
duties.
   Meese, the Artful Dodger of the Reagan administration, has had a
special prosecutor on his tail for much of the four years he has
been the nation's highest law enforcement officer. That doesn't
seem untoward to him, but it does to many of us.
   We know a defendant must be presumed innocent until proven
guilty. But the attorney general should be presumed honorable,
clean and competent, which his top aides at Justice decline to do.
Time to go, Ed.

   Evansville (Ind.) Courier on privatization of the U.S. Postal
Service:
   In a report more likely to gather dust than to trigger immediate
action, a presidential commission has come up with an intelligent
plan for privatizing the U.S. Postal Service.
   Opponents of privatization point out that the existing
government monopoly subsidizies the extra costs of rural mail
delivery with revenues from urban and suburban delivery.
   They predict that if private delivery companies were allowed to
enter the market, they would concentrate only on high-volume,
low-cost areas and leave the Feds stuck with the unprofitable rural
routes.
   The commission's response: Start by allowing free competition
only in rural delivery.
   If private companies succeed in serving rural households at
prices no higher than those of the Postal Service, ``this strategy
could go a long way toward calming the fears of rural America that
postal privatization would leave them underserved.''
   President Reagan's successor should see to it that the
experiment gets a chance.

   The Miami News on U.S.-Panama relations:
   The United States huffed when it indicted Gen. Manuel Noriega on
drug trafficking charges. It puffed when it froze Panamanian assets
and put tolls in escrow. But Noriega's house has not fallen down.
   There is a temptation to use the teeth of the big, bad wolf:
U.S. troops. White House sources said over the weekend that
intervention was being considered, then settled for sending 1,300
more troops to the Canal Zone for the legitimate purpose of
protecting U.S. citizens.
   But military intervention to oust Noriega is unwarranted.
   Besides, huffing and puffing have not yet had enough time to
work. Intervention would draw attention away from the cause of
Panama's crisis, which is Noriega.

   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on Edwin Meese:
   If (the) Justice (Department) has been ``functioning just
fine,'' we'd hate to see it when it needed a tune-up.
   Two top officials ... and their four highest aides quit abruptly.
   (Attorney General Edwin) Meese is the focus of protracted
criminal investigations by a special prosecutor into two separate
cases, Wedtech and the Iraqi oil pipeline. ...
   The attorney general is the nation's chief law enforcement
officer. ... He must also be on top of the day-to-day efforts of
the federal government to fight crime.
   Yet upper management at the department is being decimated, and
the man at the very top is preoccupied with extraneous matters and
precluded from participating in important issues.
   The resignations in the department loudly signal the necessity
for just one more. ...
   Meese should quit. Now.

   The Houston Post on the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King:
   It was 20 years ago today that the Rev. Martin Luther King was
gunned down while standing on the balcony of a Memphis, Tenn.,
motel.
   But, without a doubt, the King legacy lives on.
   To hear some people speak about him today, one would think the
man is still with us. Indeed, that is what legacies are made of.
   People across the nation will observe this day with marches,
rallies and silent prayers. ...
   While some Americans remain reluctant to admit it, King did much
of the work necessary to make this country a better place to live.
   He is still missed by many.

   Foster's Daily Democrat, Dover, N.H., on Edwin Meese:
   This late in President Reagan's term, one wonders what good it
would do to dump (Attorney General Edwin) Meese, anyway. ...
   Unless the independent counsel uncovers evidence that directly
ties Meese to criminal or unethical behavior, Meese should stay on
as attorney general.

   The Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune on Edwin Meese:
   Haven't you had enough of Ed Meese? I have.
   President Ronald Reagan's attorney general is a discredit to the
administration and to the U.S. government. ...
   Even if his friend and boss Reagan has faith in him, the high
government official is causing so many problems for the White House
that he should have long ago been graciously moved aside. Now, it's
too late.
   The fact that Reagan has presided over this stumbling entourage
without becoming thoroughly discredited himself, is the ultimate
testimony to the Teflon presidency.

   Lawrence (Kan.) Journal World on presidential campaigns:
   So far, the race for the President of the United States has been
largely an activity for ambitious politicians, with the great mass
of Americans on the sidelines waiting to see for whom they should
vote. ...
   The pace is furious and exhausting. Candidates find themselves
saying and doing things they never intended when they first
announced as candidates.
   The campaign periods last far too long. The costs are terrific
with a large portion of the expense coming out of tax funds. ...
   The United States needs a discussion of domestic and
international issues instead of an entertaining endurance contest.

   The Athens (Ga.) Daily News on the Republican presidential
campaign:
   Although it has seemed inevitable since his defeat on Super
Tuesday, Sen. Bob Dole's decision to withdraw from the Republican
presidential race leaves us with a feeling of frustration about the
campaign and the system.
   Dole is an appealing candidate who appears to have a good grasp
of the country's needs and how to attack them, yet his candidacy is
over long before much of the country's voters had an opportunity to
consider him in primaries.
   It's possible that Republicans would have preferred Vice
President George Bush if there had been a national primary after
extensive campaigning throughout the country. But it seems
unfortunate that a true competition never really developed. ...
   The selection of Bush as the nominee this early may give the
Republicans an edge in planning and organizing for the fall
campaigns. But it also gives the Democrats a single Republican
target to shoot at when they're not shooting at each other.

   Salem (Ore.) Statesman-Journal on Larry Speakes' book:
   A look at the inside from a former insider who left the fold is
always intensely interesting, in a gossipy sort of way, although we
feel a bit soiled after reading the intimate details.
   That's true for Larry Speakes. The former press aide to
President Reagan has spilled his guts in the book ``Speaking Out''.
...
   The book ... will be a best seller, but we would rather Speakes
had kept his mouth shut for a while.
   When dollar signs light up the eyeballs, however, it's not
silence that's golden. The gold comes from prattling the gossip.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on Edwin Meese:
   What will it take to get Attorney General Edwin Meese to step
aside as a criminal investigation against him unfolds? It might
take nine months.
   In that time, regardless of what transpires in the
investigation, a new president will appoint a new attorney general.
   However, Meese should get a strong message from (the) tandem
resignations of his top deputy and another high Justice Department
official, along with four of their aides.
   The two Justice Department officials' resignations are still
another indication that, guilty or not, Meese has become
ineffective as attorney general.
   He should resign and face the charges without crippling the
activities of the Justice Department. He can best serve by not
serving.

   Honolulu Star-Bulletin on Edwin Meese:
   (Attorney General Edwin) Meese has not been indicted on any
charge, but his questionable behavior has made him a liability to
President Reagan and to the Justice Department.
   In terms of the law, Meese has to be considered innocent until
proven guilty. But that standard doesn't apply to holding high
government office, where the very appearance of wrongdoing can be
grounds for departure.
   The Star-Bulletin called for Meese's resignation on Feb. 2. The
latest developments strengthen that conclusion.
   Meese has shrugged off all such suggestions, but he ought to
heed the action of these top assistants.

   Los Angeles Times on the Contra aid package:
   Central Americans must already understand that the $48 million
U.S. aid package for the Contras and other programs in Nicaragua
was motivated more by partisan U.S. politics than by any deep and
abiding concern for the plight of the Central Americans.
   Both Republicans and Democrats wanted a ``defensible'' record as
they face elections this year so that they would not be exposed to
charges that they surrendered Central America to the communists or
prolonged a senseless war.
   But there is value in the package. The $17.7 million that will
move in monthly installments to the Contras will provide only food,
cloporarily the
question of a Jackson ticket in the fall. ``Not relief,'' Kirk
replied. ``I was impressed with the results of the Dukakis
campaign.''
   Kirk said Jackson enjoyed heavy media coverage after his win in
Michigan and Dukakis had shown ``toughness to stick to the issues.''
   ``The people looked at us and made a decision as to who they
thought had the strength and the experience and the values to lead
this country ... Fortunately, I was on top,'' Dukakis said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``I hope I can do the same in New York. I
believe I can and go on and win the nomination.''
   Jackson, who appeared on ``CBS This Morning,'' congratulated
Dukakis for running ``a good, effective campaign'' in Wisconsin,
but noted his own strong showings to date.
   ``Of 40 contests that have been run now, I've come in No. 1 or
No. 2 in 30 of them and I have 250,000-plus popular vote lead and
so at this stage of the campaign I feel very good.''
   The New York contest puts the spotlight on Gov. Mario Cuomo, who
has often been mentioned as a potential draft at a deadlocked
convention. But Dukakis' win is likely to tone down talk of
drafting Cuomo or another Democrat.
   The New York governor has not made an endorsement, but the
Dukakis camp is hoping the Wisconsin win could put Dukakis in a
good position to finally win the nod from his fellow governor.
   There was a Republican primary in Wisconsin, but there were no
doubts. Vice President George Bush, the nomination his in
everything but name, bested Pat Robertson by a 10-1 margin.
   In the Democratic battle, Wisconsin gave Dukakis the boost he
had to have and perhaps pointed to a ceiling on Jackson's support.
   ``I hope it's a sign of things to come,'' said Dukakis of what
he called ``a great victory.''
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Dukakis had 481,857
or 48 percent, to 285,575 or 28 percent for Jackson. Gore had
176,009 for 17 pecent, while Simon drew only 48,877 about 5 percent.
   Dukakis edged Jackson among blue-collar workers, network exit
polls said, and won white union workers outright. That was good
news for the Massachusetts governor, who needed to show he can win
that group, which is key to the party's hopes in the fall.
   Even in Kenosha County, home of the doomed Chrysler plant where
Jackson had made a splash by joining the picket line, Dukakis won
with better than a 2-1 margin.
   ``I'm doing very well with working families ... because people
see in me someone who doesn't just talk about jobs,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor also won in Colorado's precinct
caucuses, which were held Monday, even though the counting dragged
into Tuesday.
   With 77 percent counted, Dukakis won with 44 percent to
Jackson's 37 percent. Uncommitted groups took 16 percent and Gore 3
percent.
   In the Republican caucuses in Colorado, Bush won easily over
Robertson.
   Dukakis's campaign was in serious trouble after Jackson's
stunning victory in the March 26 caucuses. But he has now won three
of four events in the past eight days _ adding Wisconsin and
Colorado to his Connecticut primary win. Jackson won the Virgin
Islands caucuses over the weekend.
   ``This is going to be a 15-round bout and it will be by a
decision ... there's no such thing as a knockout punch,'' Dukakis
said.
   The delegate numbers showed why the Democratic race could
continue to drag on. Dukakis moved ahead, but the party's rules
splitting the delegates up among the top finishers kept Jackson
close.
   Despite his victory margin, Dukakis picked up on 43 delegates in
Wisconsin to 26 for Jackson. Gore won 12.
   In Colorado, Dukakis picked up 21 national convention delegates
and Jackson 17. The other seven are uncommitted.
   That, plus partial Wisconsin results, left the AP delegate count
this way: Dukakis 735.55; Jacksn, 706.55; Gore 394.8; Simon, 170.5;
and uncommitted 516.6. A total of 2,082 votes are need to win at
the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   Tuesday's results give Dukakis the momentum going into the New
York primary, where 255 delegates are stake in the biggest single
state thus far. Then comes the Pennsylvania primary, where the
rules could allow Dukakis to win the lion's share of the delegates,
on April 26.
   Perhaps equally important, his victories this week give Dukakis
new, stronger arguments to make to the senators and representatives
who will be chosen as super delegates the same week as the New York
primary.
   With the pledged delegate count still close, the verdict of the
unpledged super delegates _ governors, Democratic National
Committee members and members of Congress _ could provide the
numbers to give Dukakis a majority.
   Jackson vowed to press on. ``I'm a long distance runner,'' he
said.

   Masked Arabs wielding grenades and
pistols and demanding freedom for pro-Iranian terrorists in Kuwait
today called a doctor aboard a hijacked jet to treat two women
believed to be members of Kuwait's royal family.
   The physician, identified only as Dr. Qassem, was quoted by
Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency as describing the condition of
one of the women as ``not satisfactory.'' The hijackers reportedly
said some passengers were ``unwell.''
   Iran's official media reported the five or six Arabic-speaking
hijackers said Tuesday that three members of Kuwait's royal
Al-Sabah family on the jet would be in ``imminent danger'' unless
Kuwait freed 17 convicted pro-Iranian extremists in 12 hours.
Kuwait rejected the demand.
   The deadline passed at 10 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EDT), according to
Tehran radio. The hijackers then contacted the Mashhad Airport
tower in northeastern Iran ``to remind that the respite is nearing
the end,'' IRNA said.
   The doctor did not identify the women he treated or say what was
wrong with them. He said he asked the hijackers to let the womem
leave the plane, but they refused, IRNA said.
   According to a passenger list from the Kuwait Airways Boeing
747, they were the only women among the 87 hostages remaining after
the release today of 24 female passengers and flight attendants.
   The Kuwaiti Cabinet called the hijackers' demands ``blackmail,''
and it sent a team to Iran to negotiate with the hijackers after
meeting in emergency session under Crown Prince Sheik Saad
al-Abdullah Al-Sabah.
   The team, made up of an unspecified number of foreign ministry
officials and some physicians, arrived in Mashhad this afternoon,
IRNA reported.
   The U.S. State Department said it believed there were no
Americans aboard the jet, which was commandeered Tuesday en route
to Kuwait from Bangkok and forced to land in Iran. The hijackers
have threatened to blow up the plane.
   One man still aboard the plane has a U.S. and an Egyptian
passport.
   Twelve Britons were still on board. In London, Foreign Office
Minister Lynda Chalker said Britain stood by Kuwait's refusal not
to yield to the hijackers' demands.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said, ``We do not give
in to blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies.''
   Austrian radio reported that some of the passengers on the plane
had their hands bound. Two Austrians who work for the computer
giant IBM in Kuwait were among the hostages.
   Austria sent one of the three diplomats at its Tehran embassy to
help in negotiations with the hijackers.
   In Vienna, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Walter Greinert
said Iran had informed Austria that the ``passengers are doing well
under the circumstances.''
   According to the passenger list, the two women from Kuwait's
royal family are Ebtesam Khaled Al-Sabah and Anware Khaled
Al-Sabah. A male member of the royal family on the jet was
identified as Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah.
   Kuwaiti sources who demanded anonymity said Fadel is a
businessman and distant relative of Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, the target of an assassination attempt by
pro-Iranian extremists in 1986.
   The women were identified as Fadel's sisters.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said that in their last contact with
the control tower today, the hijackers asked for breakfast, oxygen,
a doctor, and a generator to keep the air conditioning working. It
quoted them as telling the airport tower that ``some of the
passengers are feeling unwell.''
   The hijackers also said they did not believe ``negotiations
between them and Iranian negotiators at the aiport here would prove
useful,'' IRNA said.
   They repeated a threat to force the plane to take off for an
unspecified destination.
   There have been conflicting reports in the Iranian media over
whether the Boeing 747 has been refueled since it landed Tuesday.
Kuwait has asked Iran not to allow the jetliner to take off.
   The Iranians said the plane will have to leave if the crisis is
not resolved soon but surrounded it to keep it from taking off,
Iranian media said.
   The hijackers freed 24 women after negotiations with Iran's
Deputy Prime Minister, Ali Reza Moayyeri, Iran's official media
said. Another passenger, a Jordanian with a heart condition, was
freed Tuesday.
   The nationalities of the hijackers were not disclosed, but their
demand echoed that of Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems holding
American hostages in Lebanon _ that Kuwait release 17 militants
convicted in the December 1983 bombings of the French and U.S.
embassies and other targets in Kuwait.
   Iran accuses Kuwait of aiding Iraq in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq
war. Kuwait has been a target of Iranian-backed Shiite terrorists
for years and has jailed scores for sabotage and bombings since
1983.
   Iraq today accused Iran of masterminding the hijacking. The
official Iraqi News Agency quoted an Iraqi Foreign Ministry
spokesman as saying the hijackers were Iranian agents.
   Among the 97 passengers and 15 crew aboard the plane when it was
seized were 30 Kuwaitis, 22 Britons, eight Thais and a person with
a U.S. and an Egyptian passport identified only as R. Attiaallaali,
according to the passenger list.
   IRNA identified the released women, who included five flight
attendants, as 10 Britons, three Thais, three Egyptians, a
Filipina, a Palestinian, a Singaporean, an Irishwoman, a German, an
Austrian, a Syrian and a Pakistani.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said, ``We do not
give in to blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies.''
   ``It does seem as if the hijackers have some humane feelings
after all,'' said the mother of 25-year-old Nicola Appleby, a
Briton on the plane who apparently was among the women set free. In
London, Margaret Jones said she was still waiting for news of her
son Mark, 23, who boarded the flight from Bangkok with his sister.

   Four U.S. string quartets will try to
outplay 18 other ensembles in this south England port city's fourth
international string quartet competition beginning Wednesday.
   The musicians will compete for a first prize of about $12,200
and the chance to perform under the baton of violinist Sir Yehudi
Menuhin, president of the jury and conductor of a victory contest
Sunday for the winning quartet, said Christina Eveleigh, a
spokesman with the competition.
   Other prizes range from an award worth about $7,000 for the
second-best musicians to a $900 seventh-place prize to be decided
by audience vote after the finals, she said.
   Another prize will be awarded by the three-member jury to the
most promising quartet which does not make it beyond the first
round of competition.
   In addition to Menuhin, British quartet leader Sidney Griller
and Yfrah Neaman, artistic consultant of the competition, will
judge the contest.
   The competition has been held every three years since 1979, and
has been won by a Hungarian, Austrian, and most recently a U.S.
ensemble called the Alexander Quartet from Binghamton, N.Y.
   Competing this year are groups from Australia, Austria, China,
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, East Germany, France, Great Britain,
Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Poland and the United States.
   A group from Beijing, China withdrew last week for unknown
reasons but one from Shanghai remains in the competition. Another
group from Poland was forced to withdraw when a player was injured.
   The U.S. groups are: the Harrington String Quartet from Canyon,
Texas; the Tidewater Area Musicians from Portsmouth, Va.; the
Lafayette Quartet from Rochester, Mich., and the Sierra Quartet
from San Francisco.

<TEXT>
   David Ruffin, former lead singer for the
Temptations, was released from jail today after spending the night
there on a cocaine possession charge.
   Wayne County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Nancy Mouradian
said Ruffin left the Wayne County Jail on posting either a $1,500
surety or $150 cash bond.
   Ruffin, 46, was arraigned Tuesday before Magistrate Vesta
Svenson on a charge of possession with intent to distribute less
than 20 grams of cocaine. If convicted, Ruffin could be sentenced
to 20 years in prison.
   The singer, who left the Motown group in 1968, was scheduled for
a preliminary examination Monday.
   Ruffin was charged in connection with a July raid on a Detroit
house. Officials said he was in the basement, but a pouch
containing suspected cocaine residue and personal papers with his
name was found on a kitchen table.
   In 1982, Ruffin pleaded guilty to evading $177,359 in federal
income taxes on 1976 earnings.
   The Temptations, a cornerstone of the Motown sound, was formed
in 1960 and recorded dozens of hits including ``My Girl,'' ``Ain't
Too Proud to Beg'' and ``(I Know I'm) Losing You.''

   The fine for parking illegally in problem
traffic areas of Manhattan may leap from $40 to $100, city
officials said.
   The higher fines would be for illegally parking at fire
hydrants, expired meters, in no-parking and no-standing zones, and
for blocking driveways in the most congested areas.
   In addition, the city wants to boost the towing fee from $100 to
$125.
   ``In a way we're competing with garages,'' said Samuel Schwartz,
first deputy transportation commissioner. ``Garage fees are so high
that people think it's cheaper to park illegally. The $100 parking
ticket will change that.''
   The new fines require the approval of the Legislature, which has
a $50 cap for the fees municipalities can charge for illegal
parking.
   Schwartz said passage is expected.

   Nearly 80 percent of the convicts entering state
prisons are involved with drugs, according to an internal study for
the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.
   The study, which found the typical inmate is an unemployed high
school dropout with a drug or alcohol problem, concludes that crime
in Texas will get worse if the state builds new prisons at the
expense of education and social programs.
   The study of 1,483 offenders admitted to the Texas Department of
Corrections in one month late last year found that four-fifths of
them _ whether they were entering prison as a result of a court
sentence, probation violation or parole revocation _ had used
drugs, were under the influence of drugs when they were arrested or
were convicted of a drug-related offense.
   ``Texas expenditures for substance abuse are so minimal that
there are practically no resources available,'' said parole board
researcher Pablo Martinez, noting that Texas ranks near the bottom
of the 50 states in funding for drug and alcohol programs.

<HEAD>City Gets Tentative Go-Ahead To Raffle Repossessed Homes To Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city has gotten tentative approval
to buy homes repossessed for unpaid government mortgages and sell
them for $1 to poor families chosen through a raffle, officials
said.
   ``There are going to be some mighty lucky people out there'' if
the program wins full approval, said Phillip Aguirre, local urban
homesteading coordinator for the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
   The city had asked for $600,000 to buy homes in three
neighborhoods, but the amount is likely to be less, Aguirre said
Tuesday.
   The application has been approved by HUD, but the contract
agreement between the city and the federal government has yet to be
drawn up.
   ``HUD agrees with the plan in principle,'' Aguirre said. ``I
just doubt that it will come out with full funding the first time
around.''
   Under the homesteading program, the buyers must repair, maintain
and occupy the homes for a minimum of five consecutive years.
   Margi Gant, the city's Community Development Office coordinator,
said that if $600,000 is approved, 24 homes could be bought at the
$25,000 maximum allowed.
   The development office should receive a contract from HUD later
this month, officials said.
   To get in the lottery, home seekers will have to show they
qualify for a government loan or can do repairs to ensure the home
is rehabilitated. Once the work is complete, the deed to the home
will be sold to the purchaser for $1.
   The houses repossessed will be those foreclosed on HUD or
Federal Housing Administration loans.

<HEAD>Drug Cartel Laundered Huge Amounts of Money, Congress Told</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs graf 5, He showed the, to fix garble.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Colombian cocaine ring made such enormous
profits that it created its own courier service to move the cash, a
convicted money launderer told Congress today.
   ``Basically, there is no effective interdiction for money,''
Ramon Milian Rodriguez told a Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee. ``The problem the launderer faces is security, not an
authority per se.''
   Rodriguez, a Cuban-born accountant, is serving a 43-year prison
term for money laundering. He has admitted serving as a chief U.S.
money launderer for the Medillin cartel, the drug ring named after
the Colombian city where it is based.
   Rodriguez said he was handling up to $2 billion a year for the
cartel.
   He showed the subcomittee boxes he said were used by the cartel
for shipping cash. They were inscribed with the name ``Consolidated
Courier Services.''
   The boxes were designed specifically to carry the cash and were
loaded onto pallets to be lifted aboard airplanes and flown from
the United States to Central America, Rodriguez told the
subcommittee.
   His testimony came a day after the committee was told that a top
Haitian military officer offered to sell high-quality cocaine for
shipment to the United States, flying the drugs from a lighted,
8,400-foot private airstrip at his ranch.
   Miami businessman Osvaldo Quintana described the lavish
lifestyle of Haitian Col. Jean-Claude Paul, the influence Paul
wielded and the fear he evoked in Haitian citizens with whom he
came in contact. Quintana said the cocaine deal was discussed at
the Dessaline Barracks in Port-au-Prince, headquarters of an elite
military unit Paul commands.
   Paul is under indictment in Miami on charges of conspiring to
import cocaine but apparently is out of the reach of U.S.
authorities because he cannot be extradited. Quintana's life has
been threatened by Haitian drug figures and he is under protection
by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   He testified Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations
narcotics subcommittee, which is holding a series of hearings on
the drug trade in Latin America. The panel planned to call other
witnesses today to describe money laundering and to spell out how
the State Department used at least one alleged drug trafficker to
ferry supplies to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   In federal court in Washington on Tuesday, the committee
obtained limited immunity from prosecution for future testimony
from Michael B. Palmer, who faces drug charges in Michigan. Palmer,
as an official of the Miami aircraft leasing firm Vortex, had a
contract in early 1986 with the State Department's Nicaraguan
Humanitarian Assistance Organization, which funneled humanitarian
aid to the Contras.
   Michael P. Vogel, another witness before the panel on Tuesday
who now is serving a 12{-year sentence on marijuana charges, said
Palmer had been arrested along with himself on identical charges,
but was dropped from the indictment in March of 1986 while under
contract to the State Department.
   ``It is unusual. It is strange,'' Vogel said.
   He acknowledged he once had felt bitterness about what he saw as
Palmer's preferential treatment, but said he now was more concerned
about the corrupting influence of drugs.
   ``You can't use drug smugglers for other tasks by the
government,'' Vogel said.
   The Miami businessman, Quintana, told the panel he had run an
honest seafood brokerage enterprise until he was approached in 1986
by Marie Merielle Delinois, then Paul's wife, about a seafood deal.
Paul at first offered to sell seafood at below market prices, and
asked a $1-a-pound commission, he said.
   But the deal later turned into a drug transaction, and Paul
arranged for 412 kilos of cocaine to be flown from a grass airstrip
on his ranch 90 miles from the Haitian capital, Quintana said.
   When Quintana and an associate told Paul they needed a sample of
the cocaine, which tested at about 90 percent pure, to take back to
the United States, the colonel personally carried it past customs
officials in his holster for them, Quintana testified.
   Paul was able to identify U.S. drug and CIA agents in his
country because he had a contact inside the U.S. Embassy in
Port-au-Prince, he said.
   But a pilot hired to carry the drugs to the United States landed
in the Bahamas and stole them, he told the subcommittee. As
guarantor of the $4 million deal, Quintana was threatened by
Haitians who had provided the drugs. When he tried to get them
back, he walked into a DEA sting operation and was arrested,
Quintana said.
   Quintana was later sent out by the DEA to make further contacts
with Paul as an undercover operative, and it was his testimony
which enabled the indictment to be obtained.

in a Chicago housing project.
   In preparing the story, Kotlowitz spent three months with a
12-year-old boy and his family in the Henry Horner Homes in
Chicago. He will receive a $2,000 grand prize, Susan Pastrick of
the awards office said Wednesday.
   ``Mr. Kotlowitz has given us a common story from an uncommon
viewpoint,'' said Lesley Stahl of CBS News and chairwoman of the
awards committee. ``It is an important piece of journalism and an
outstanding example of what the RFK awards program is about.''
   First prize in television went to WCVB-TV in Boston for ``Inside
Bridgewater,'' first prize in photojournalism went to Donna Ferrato
of The Philadelphia Inquirer for ``Domestic Violence,'' and first
prize in the editorial cartoon category went to Don Wright of The
Miami News.
   Honorable mentions (second place) went to:
   _Television: WCBV-TV, Boston, for ``Back Country Blues.''
   _Print: The Atlanta Constitution and Journal, ``Rural Justice.''
   _Photojournalism: Michel duCille, The Miami Herald, ``Crack the
Graveyard.''
   _Editorial Cartoons: Bill Day, The Detroit Free Press.
   Citations (third place) went to:
   _Television: WBZ-TV, Boston, ``AIDS: The Paul Cronan Story.''
   _Print: The Sacramento Bee, ``Hunger in California.''
   _Photojournalism: Manny Crisostomo, The Detroit Free Press,

   _Editorial Cartoons: Doug Marlette, The Atlanta Constitution.
   The awards _ accompanied by $1,000 each for the first-prize
winners _ will be presented May 16 by Mrs. Robert F. Kennedy at a
ceremony and reception at her home in northern Virginia, Ms.
Pastrick said.
   The awards program is dedicated to the memory and concerns of
Kennedy, the late senator from New York who was assassinated in Los
Angeles in 1968 while he was running for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   The program is sponsored by the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial and
is open to professional and student journalists.

<HEAD>Shiite Militias Fight in South Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought in
the streets of south Lebanon on Wednesday, the second day of a
battle for supremacy in which police say 12 people have been killed
and 34 wounded.
   A police spokesman said the mainstream Amal militia used armored
vehicles, artillery, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades against
the Hezbollah, or Party of God, in 14 towns and villages.
   Amal is led by Nabih Berri, the Lebanese justice minister, and
has Syrian support. The fundamentalist Hezbollah is loyal to Iran.
   Militia officers also ``toured the south in loudspeaker vans
blaring warnings to Hezbollah fighters to surrender their weapons
and avert the bloodshed,'' the police spokesman said.
   He quoted Amal as telling Hezbollah gunmen: ``Our main aim is
security and stability for the south. Whoever surrenders his weapon
will live in peace.''
   Fear was expressed in many circles that the war for supremacy in
the predominantly Shiite region would spread to the rest of
Lebanon, which has been ravaged by civil war for 13 years. This led
the nation's most leading Shiite cleric, Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, to order an end to the battle.
   ``We prohibit this fighting because it burns Islam's causes and
the Moslems,'' he said in a fatwa, or religious ruling.
   Despite Fadlallah's declaration, Amal-Hezbollah fighting raged
all day from Nabatiyeh, an inland market town, to the ancient port
of Tyre.
   The police spokesman, whose name was withheld in accordance with
regulations, gave this account:
   Amal forces with armored personnel carriers and 106mm recoilless
artillery advanced across Nabatiyeh's main street to the town's old
sector, where Hezbollah fighters were installed in sniping nests.
   ``The fighting in Nabatiyeh is ferocious. Rescue teams have not
been able to evacuate casualties in some parts of the town.
Nabatiyeh citizens have been hiding in basements and bomb shelters
since Tuesday.''
   About 50 women and old men ventured out in a relatively quiet
neighborhood ``chanting slogans demanding an end to the fighting''
but ``dashed for cover again when two mortar rounds slammed into
the neighborhood.''
   Berri's militiamen stormed Hezbollah positions in the village of
Siddiqine, eight miles southeast of Tyre, before dawn.
   Hezbollah fighters sought refugee at Siddiqine's
Iranian-financed Shiite religious school, the main base of Sheik
Abdul Moneem Mhanna, said to be a Hezbollah leader in the Tyre
region.
   ``Amal militiamen surrounded Mhanna's school and are calling on
Hezbollah fighters to surrender.''
   All Amal and Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon are on ``full
alert. Each side has erected checkpoints in its areas of influence
to prevent the other from reinforcing its positions.''
   Fighting began Tuesday when Hezbollah gunmen attacked an Amal
checkpoint near Nabatiyeh, killing an Amal militiaman and wounding
four others. The police spokesman said the attack followed Amal
raids on houses in Nabatiyeh and surrounding villages in which 10
Hezbollah members were captured.
   He said Amal was searching for Hezbollah members suspected of
opening fire Monday on the car of the Amal chief in Nabatiyeh,
Mahmoud Faqih, who was not in the vehicle.
   Relations between Amal and Hezbollah have deteriorated since
Feb. 17 when Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, the U.S. Marine who
commands the U.N. truce observer unit, was kidnapped near Tyre.
Amal rounded up dozens of Hezbollah members it accused of
involvement.
   Hezbollah has denied involvement in the abduction of Higgins,
43, of Danville, Ky., and said Amal was ``harassing the believers
by searching for an American spy.''
   A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth, a pro-Iranian underground group believed affiliated with
Hezbollah, has claimed responsibility for abducting Higgins.
   Hezbollah is thought to be an umbrella group for pro-Iranian
underground factions holding most of the 22 foreigners missing and
presumably kidnapped in Lebanon.
   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, abducted March 16, 1985.

   Police in four countries arrested 12
people and cracked the largest drug ring based in Sweden,
authorities said Wednesday.
   The latest arrests bring to 15 the number of arrests in the case
since last year. Authorities have also seized 240 pounds of heroin.
   Five ring leaders, all Swedes of Turkish origin, were arrested
at the end of March in Sweden, the Netherlands and West Germany,
said Birger Hemmingsson, who heads Sweden's anti-narcotics division.
   West German police arrested another five ring members on March
28 in Darmstadt and found 55 pounds of heroin, he said. Danish
police arrested a Turkish couple at the same time.
   Italian police last year arrested three Italian members of the
ring in Verona, seizing 187 pounds of heroin, Hemmingsson said.
   The ring was believed to have operated for at least two years,
shipping large amounts of heroin from Turkey to Europe. The
distributor in Turkey has not been arrested, Hemmingsson said.
   He said the drugs were bound for other European countries.

   A small plane crashed in a field about a
half-mile south of Manassas Municipal Airport, killing four people,
authorities said today.
   Before the crash, the pilot had reported poor visibility and
requested weather information for two other airports, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. The plane was
headed for the Manassas airport.
   The names of the victims were not immediately released. Manassas
police said the victims included a male pilot, 60, and three female
passengers, ages 60, 30 and 12.
   The wreckage was spotted shortly after dawn today. Rescue
workers had to cut the aircraft in half to remove the bodies.
   The plane, a Piper Archer, was registered to Johnnie Q. Herrin
of Nahunta, Ga., the FAA said. The flight's origination point was
not known, Ms. Bergen said.
   The plane crashed after the pilot radioed a Washington flight
control center at about 8 p.m. Tuesday and reported poor
visibility, Ms. Bergen said. The pilot requested weather
information for Charlottesville and Dulles International Airport
near Washington.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the
crash.

<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case today ruled
he needed more time to study independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh's plan to prevent unauthorized disclosure of 150,000 pages of
classified documents.
   In a brief opinion, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell denied
Walsh's motion for expedited consideration of the proposed
protective order, saying it ``appears to be far too complex, lacks
definite time restrictions and creates undue obstacles to the fair
and expeditious disposition of this case.''
   But the judge said he wants to set an April deadline for Walsh's
review of the classified material and fix a time for the defense to
notify the court whether it intends to use any of the secret
documents as evidence.
   Gesell said he would hear further argument at next Tuesday's
hearing on ``the timing of discovery disclosures in relation to a
realistic trial date.''
   The documents, which Walsh says ``describe in detail some of the
nation's most carefully held secrets about its foreign policy, its
intelligence activities and its covert activities,'' must be turned
over to the defense as part of pre-trial discovery.
   Some of the documents from the CIA, the State Department, the
National Security Council and other agencies may be introduced as
evidence after they are declassified or secret material is deleted.
   Lawyers for former national security adviser John Poindexter,
Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and
Albert Hakim had filed a motion opposing Walsh's plan to require
them and their clients to obtain security clearances to examine the
material.
   The four are accused of conspiracy to defraud the government by
diverting arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Walsh had sought expedited consideration of his plan by the
judge.
   But Gesell said: ``It will be necessary to frame a more limited
protective order fashioned to the nature of this case, which in
essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified
materials in classified channels from a highly classified site.''
   The proposal includes setting up a ``secure compartmented
information facility'' where the defense lawyers would be required
to work with the documents and compose any pleadings that quote the
material.
   Without such procedures, Walsh said, he cannot begin turning
over the material to the defense for pre-trial discovery.
   Walsh had also asked Gesell to establish intricate procedures
under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) for court
review of classified documents to determine how such information
could be disclosed in court.
   The act empowers a trial judge to delete classified portions of
a document if it is irrelevent to the case or to substitute a
statement of facts that secret material would prove if shown to a
jury.
   In a joint pleading filed Tuesday, defense lawyers opposed
Walsh's motion because it raised questions about ``the
constitutionality (as well as the statutory propriety) of various
aspects of the proposed order even if the CIPA itself is
constitutional.''
   The defense said it wants more time to file briefs on a number
of issues it contends are raised by Walsh's proposal.
   The defense contends that the proposed order would impose
``improper and questionable'' conditions on the defense lawyers and
their clients.
   The defense noted that the order would apply to classified
information that had already been known to the defendants,
particularly North and Poindexter.
   The attorneys also questioned whether Walsh, as an independent
counsel, has the proper authority to enforce the Classified
Information Procedures Act.
   The defense said Walsh's request raises ``questions whether the
president's foreign affairs and national security responsibilities
can be delegated to an official such as Mr. Walsh.''
   In reply, Walsh said the defense was attempting ``to invent
substantive isues concerning the proposed protective order where
none exists.''
   Walsh labeled ``transparent'' the defense objection to applying
the restrictions to North and Poindexter.
   ``Classified information does not become declassified because a
criminal defendant knew it before he was indicted; if that were the
case, there would have been no need for the CIPA in the many
espionage trials where the statute has been used extensively,''
Walsh said.

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old Israeli girl and
two Palestinians were shot to death in a clash today between
Israeli civilians and Arabs in a West Bank village, the army said.
It said 15 Israelis, including a soldier, were wounded.
   The Israeli girl was the first Israeli civilian to die in four
months of unrest in the occupied territories.
   There were conflicting reports on what led to the violence in
Beita, about 15 miles from Nablus.
   Palestinians who said they witnessed the clash from a half-mile
away said about 30 Israeli settlers entered the village on foot and
fired without provocation, killing one Arab.
   Angry villagers then charged the settlers, the Palestinians said.
   ``The first man who was killed, Mousa Saleh Abu Shamseh, was
plowing his land,'' said Mohammed Abbas Aly. Abu Shamseh was 20.
   ``When they heard a farmer was killed, they attacked the
settlers with axes, picks and rocks. There was hand-to-hand
fighting,'' said Aly, who was interviewed at Nablus' Al Ittihad
Hospital.
   Aly said Fayez Al Jabr, 22, was killed when he ran toward the
settlers brandishing a stick.
   The army and Israeli witnesses said the violence began when
Palestinians stoned a group of Israeli teen-agers on a Passover bus
and hiking tour of the West Bank.
   An army statement said two security guards on the bus opened
fire at the stone-throwers, killing two Arabs and wounding two
others. During the clash, the army said Arabs grabbed an M-16
automatic rifle and an Uzi submachine gun from the guards and
opened fire on the Israelis, killing the girl and wounding three
other Israelis.
   Boleslav Godlman, administrator of Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel
Aviv, said an adult and nine children ages 14 and 15 suffered minor
injuries. He said most of the 10 were hit by stones and metal
fragments.
   Most of the injured reportedly were teen-agers from the Jewish
settlement of Elon Moreh, near Nablus.
   A soldier was injured in the head by a rock and was in serious
condition in Jerusalem's Haddassah hospital, the army said. Another
Israeli teen-ager was found slightly wounded in a villager's home.
   The army said the 17-year-old girl, whose name was not made
public immediately, was killed by a bullet. It gave no details on
how the other Israeli civilians were wounded.
   Shmuel Fuchs, 15, from Elon Moreh near Nablus, said 18
teen-agers, a soldier and a guide had left the bus and were sitting
in a dry river bed when a group of Arabs began throwing stones at
them.
   The Israelis got up and left ``and soon we discovered we were
being followed by dozens of Arabs,'' Fuchs said from his Haddassah
Hospital bed.
   Fuchs had a bandage on his right arm and the right side of his
chest but said he did not know if he was hit by rocks or by bullets.
   He said some of the Arabs following the Israelis apparently
wanted to help them and said ``come fast we'll lead you out of
here.''
   The Arabs led them a short distance to Beita. There, Fuchs said,
``a woman came with a huge stone, and she threw it at the head of
the soldier.''
   He said the guide who was armed opened fire on the Arabs.
   Gaby Bron, a reporter for Yediot Ahronot, said teen-agers at the
bus radioed for help, and troops arrived and sealed the area, he
said.
   The deaths brought to 140 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis since unrest broke out Dec. 8 in the territories occupied
by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. One Israeli soldier has been
killed.
   Benny Katzover, a settler leader in the West Bank, said the
attack on civilians could prompt some of the 65,000 Israelis living
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to take vigilante action.
   ``This is a most serious confrontation. If this time the
situation is not brought under control, I think it will be
impossible to stop every Jew from taking things into his own
hands,'' Katzover told Israel army radio.
   Jihad Hawari, the Arab head of the Israeli-appointed village
council of Hawara, near Beita, said Beita had been declared
``liberated'' from Israeli rule and was bedecked with the outlawed
Palestinian flag.
   Arab witnesses said the clash lasted about 1{ hours, until
soldiers arrived.
   The entrance to the village was blocked by seven army jeeps by
afternoon, and an army helicopter hovered overhead. The army said a
curfew was imposed on the area, confining the village's 12,000
residents to their homes.
   The army said it was searching for the Arab attackers.

   It may seem as if a new set of golden
arches is springing up every day, but the McDonald's fast-food
restaurant that opened for business Wednesday was special. It was
No. 10,000.
   The corporation known for reciting numbers as if they had
mystical properties _ more than 65 billion hamburgers served _
dispatched about 20,000 balloons skyward at the opening in Dale
City and another 10,000 exactly at the Convention Center in
Washington, where it was holding its biannual convention for
franchisees and partners, said Richard G. Starmann, senior vice
president.
   ``It's almost 33 years to the day when Ray Kroc opened his first
McDonald's,'' said the corporation's president and chief executive
officer, Mike Quinlan. ``If Ray were here, he would be fiercely
proud of the McDonald's family.''
   The fast-food chain branched into Eastern Europe on March 24
when it opened a restaurant in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia,
and plans to open another one in Budapest in May. Hungary will thus
become the 50th country around the world to have a McDonald's.
   Of the 10,000 restaurants, 75 percent are locally operated by
independent entrepreneurs. Others are joint-venture partnerships
and some wholly owned subsidiaries, Starmann said.
   Kroc opened the first McDonald's restaurant on April 15, 1955,
in Des Plaines, Ill. Sales on that rainy day, according to a
statement from the company, were $366.12.
   Last year, McDonald's worldwide sales were $14.3 billion and it
served 22 million customers in 49 countries. It passed the mark of
60 billion hamburgers served in November 1986.

   Officials investigating the hijack of a
Kuwait Airways jet that departed from Bangkok were told Wednesday
that four passengers may have boarded with forged Bahraini
passports.
   A senior member of the Thai police force who asked not to be
identified told The Associated Press that Bahraini officials had
contacted the Thais concerning the possible fogery. The identities
of the four have not been released.
   The Thai government has made virtually no statements on the
hijack of Flight 422, which was commandeered Tuesday while en route
from Bangkok to Kuwait, and it appeared to be trying to keep the
investigation on a low key, possibly to avoid embarrassment should
a security flaw at the airport be discovered.
   Vidhya Rayanonda, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters
he did not think Thailand's image would be damaged because
``hijacks occur everywhere.''
   Vidhya said security at Bangkok's Don Muang International
Airport was adequate and he raised the possibility that the weapons
used by the hijackers might have been put on the Boeing 747 in
Kuwait. The airliner flew into Bangkok from Kuwait on Monday and
was on the ground for about 15 hours before taking off for Kuwait.
   One passenger was quoted by Iranian media as saying the
hijackers were armed with pistols and hand grenades.
   ``We still don't know where the weapons came from or how they
got there (on the plane) in the first place,'' said Charoon
Peetong, the general manager of the airport.
   ``But we are looking for serious answers to our questions,
though answers will more likely be found in Mashhad,'' he said,
referring to the northeastern Iranian city where the plane was
diverted.
   Charoon said authorities were double-checking all personnel who
were near the jumbo jet before take-off Tuesday, including the
airline's caterer, ground mechanics and those who refueled the
aircraft, he said.
   There have been no known major complaints from foreign
governments or international agencies about security at Bangkok
airport. Passengers and carry-on luggage are searched by electronic
devices.

   Evan Mecham may be the first U.S. governor
in 59 years to have lost his job through impeachment conviction,
but he isn't ready to say he's giving up politics.
   Interviewed this morning on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
Mecham said that he'd ``definitely run in it (a recall election)
unless they get it so tied up in legal technicalities. I can win
the re-election, win the recall election, I think.''
   Acting Secretary of State Karen Osborne's office said today that
she had ordered Mecham's name removed from the recall ballot
pending a resolution of legal issues. The attorney general's office
said that because Mecham was placed on the ballot through his
status as governor, and not by gathering petitions as the other
candidates did, he is no longer entitled to be on it.
   Earlier, the ousted Republican governor told a Kiwanis club,
``This is just another chapter in a book, and this book isn't near
the end.''
   ``I haven't yet determined what my course will be,'' Mecham told
the group Tuesday, one day after he was ousted by the Senate. ``I
haven't yet said that I'm not going to be a candidate in the recall
(on May 17). I'm not even sure that I choose to be in.''
   As Mecham's replacement, former Secretary of State Rose Mofford,
was sworn in Tuesday, Attorney General Bob Corbin said he hoped the
Arizona Supreme Court would decide within a week whether the recall
election must still be held.
   Concerned Arizona Voters, a pro-Mecham group, has dropped its
opposition to the election because it now sees the recall as the
former governor's last hope for regaining his office.
   Mecham, who described himself as the ``recent former governor,''
appeared relaxed Tuesday. ``I have no rancor in my heart for
anybody,'' he said.
   However, he warned that those who ousted him may not realize
they have ``awakened a sleeping giant'' in the Arizona electorate.
   ``I know that they are aroused, I know that they are incensed, I
know that they are right-down angry,'' said Mecham.
   He jokingly referred to the Kiwanis group as the ``round-eyes
club,'' recalling the day several months ago when Mecham was
severely criticized for telling the same group that when a group of
Japanese people were told about Arizona's golf courses, ``suddenly
they got round eyes.''
   Recalling his remark, the former governor said, ``That's an
in-house joke between me and this club and, let's see, about half
the world, I think.''
   Mecham, who also provoked criticism for comments that were
perceived as slurs against blacks, homosexuals and Jews, became the
first governor to be removed from office in 59 years on Monday when
the Senate convicted him of obstructing justice and misusing
$80,000 from the governor's protocol fund.
   Several weeks ago, Mecham had said that if the Senate convicted
him, he might go to the U.S. Supreme Court to claim that his rights
had been violated. He said Tuesday he had not decided whether he
will do so.
   Mecham also faces a criminal trial April 21 on charges of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. If convicted, he would be
barred from holding office again.
   But Mecham said today he was confident that if justice prevails,
he will be found innocent. ``If we can get a fair jury, we should
get acquitted quite easily,'' he said on ``Good Morning America.''

   John Cage's only opera, ``Europeras 1 & 2,''
will have its American premiere this summer at the PepsiCo
Summerfare program.
   One hundred forty artists plus technicians are required to put
on the opera, which will be staged in Purchase, north of the city.
   Cage derived conducting, costume choices, stage movement and
some of the music by consulting the ancient Chinese fortune-telling
I Ching, much as he does when composing for dance. A computer
program that adds time to spatial dimensions helped as well.
   Summerfarem, which runs July 8-31, will present the Frankfurt
(Germany) Opera's production of the Cage work.
   It also is staging an opera in which Director Peter Sellars
moves the action from the time and place written in the libretto.
This summer he will set ``The Marriage of Figaro'' in the Penthouse
at Manhattan's Trump Tower, apparently because that's a place where
people still have uniformed servants.

   A railroad worker was killed and two
others injured when two empty commuter trains collided this
morning, halting all service on Metro-North's New Haven line at the
height of the rush hour, authorities said.
   An eight-car train moving at full speed crashed into the rear of
a five-car train halted by a problem with overhead electrical wires
about one mile west of the Mount Vernon station just north of New
York City, said Mount Vernon police Lt. John O'Brien.
   The dead worker, who was not identified, was believed to be the
engineer of the second train, authorities said. His body was
trapped inside the motorman's compartment of the lead car, which
was catapulted into overhead electrical wires on impact and came to
rest atop the last car of the other train.
   Three of the remaining cars of the second train were derailed
and at least 100 feet of track was ripped from the ground. Windows,
train seats, wires and torn metal was scattered for 300 feet along
the tracks.
   The railroad could not say when service would resume on the
line, which spokesman Dan Brucker said serves 28,900 commuters each
morning.
   The two injured workers were listed in good condition in
hospital. Train conductor Anthony Paturzo, 58, suffered bruises and
Joseph Vanacore, 34, had a broken leg.
   Four other workers on the trains were uninjured and were being
interviewed by investigators trying to determine the cause of the
accident, Metro-North spokeswoman Susan Gilbert said.

<HEAD>USDA Quarantines Bees and Equipment in 13 States Hit With Killer
Mite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal quarantine to help prevent the
spread of a tiny killer mite that threatens the U.S. bee industry
has been ordered for 13 states where the pest has been detected so
far, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The restrictions, effective immediately, ban the shipment from
those states of bees and apiary equipment, said Larry B. Slagle,
acting associate administrator of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
   States affected by the quarantine are: Florida, Illinois, Maine,
Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin.
   Of the major honey producing states, only California and North
Dakota so far remain unaffected by the mites, whose scientific name
is Varroa jacobsoni. The female is about one-twentieth of an inch
in diameter, and the male is somewhat smaller.
   The mites were first discovered in the United States last
September in a Wisconsin apiary and since have spread to the 12
other states.
   ``Varroa mites can be spread by the movement of queen bees,
package bees, hives, pollen, honeycomb with brood cells, and apiary
equipment and vehicles,'' Slagle said. ``Under our regulations,
these articles will be prohibited from moving interstate from
quarantined areas unless certain conditions are met.''
   If agency inspectors determine that there is no risk of mites,
they can issue certificates allowing the movement of articles out
of the quarantined states, he said. In other cases, a ``limited
permit'' may be issued to move articles that not pose a pest risk,
provided that additional precautions are taken.
   Slagle said the quarantine order ``will help protect our
beekeeping industry as well as the estimated $20 billion worth of
agricultural crops pollinated by bees each year.''
   The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their
developing larvae, or brood, Slagle said. The pests cause decreased
brood, deformed bees and weakening of the colony's ability to
pollinate plants and produce honey. Infestation can occur so
gradually that the mites may go unnoticed until serious damage is
done.

<HEAD>Judge Orders DeSillers To Return Attorney Fees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a woman to return $25,000 she
paid her lawyers from money donated for her 7-year-old son's liver
transplants.
   ``The withdrawal was an illegal and unlawful act,'' Circuit
Judge Francis J. Christie said Tuesday during a hearing on the
action by Maria DeSillers. ``She must return that sum to the
(Ronnie's) estate, which subsequently, and ironically, she could
very well become heir to.''
   Ronnie died April 29 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant at
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. His plight moved hundreds of
people, including President Reagan, to donate more than $670,000
for his operations.
   Ms. DeSillers paid $25,000 to the father-and-son law office of
Leonard and Harry Robbins, who argued Tuesday that she was entitled
to use the money.
   ``DeSillers was a woman alone in the world,'' Leonard Robbins
said. ``All she knew (was) that she was being attacked from all
sides when she went to hire an attorney.''
   During the hearing, trust curator Karen Gievers claimed that the
law office had violated state probate and banking laws by accepting
the money. Ms. Gievers was appointed trust curator last month to
oversee the $239,287 that remains in Ronnie's trust accounts.
   Harry Robbins said he will continue representing Ms. DeSillers
regardless of her financial troubles.
   Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh is suing Ms. DeSillers for
$262,000, what it claims is the unpaid portion of Ronnie's $424,300
medical bill. Ms. DeSillers has said she refused to pay the balance
because of allegedly poor care. She and Harry Robbins have said
they plan to countersue the hospital.
   The state has filed an administrative complaint against Ms.
DeSillers and fined her $1,000 for allegedly violating charity
laws. The complaint and fine are being appealed.
   Ms. DeSillers' use of Ronnie's trust also is being investigated
by Dade State Attorney Janet Reno. That investigation prompted Ms.
Gievers' appointment.

<HEAD>Vietnam Delivers Remains, Along with a Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Wednesday delivered remains
said to be those of 27 missing Americans, and it threatened to stop
the search if the United States continues accusing it of playing
politics with the dead.
   In a solemn military ceremony, 27 sets of remains were put on a
U.S. Air Force transport jet to be flown to Army laboratories in
Honolulu for authentication. It was the largest delivery yet by the
Vietnamese.
   Hanoi also turned over three sets of remains described as those
of ethnic Asians who also may be missing Americans from the long
war in Vietnam, which ended with a communist victory in April 1975.
   The large delivery had encouraged U.S. officials to anticipate
more help from Hanoi, but senior Vietnamese had sharp comments
about allegations that they warehouse remains and return them
gradually for political reasons.
   They also said Washington should help finance Vietnam's
reconstruction if it wants a full accounting of the 1,767 Americans
still listed as missing in action.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, who met with U.S. Sen. Larry
Pressler, R-S.D., on Wednesday, responded ``very angrily'' to a
recent Pentagon statement that Vietnam was returning remains
gradually, said an American participant in the talks.
   ``That is nonsense,'' Nguyen Can, head of Vietnam's MIA
accounting office, said in an interview Tuesday. ``The next time
they make such a statement, we will have to reconsider whether we
will do the job. This shows there is no goodwill on the part of the
U.S.''
   Two dozen peasants in conical bamboo hats squatting in an
adjacent field watched as the 27 small caskets, each with a folded
American flag on top, were placed into the belly of the giant C-141
aircraft at Noi Bai airport.
   Pressler, a Vietnam veteran and member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, joined a military team from the U.S. Joint
Casualty Resolution Center in saluting the caskets as they passed
on the tarmac under overcast skies.
   Vietnam provided names for at least half the 27 remains, said
Lt. Col. Paul Mather of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center. They
were not made public.
   ``This being the largest, we hope it means increased
collaboration,'' said Maj. Virginia Pribyla, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. Pacific Command. She also said, however, that the United
States believes Vietnam has more information than it has divulged.
   It was the fourth return of remains since Vietnam agreed in
talks with U.S. envoy John W. Vessey in August to resume its MIA
accounting efforts.
   Nguyen Dy Nien, a deputy foreign minister, accompanied it with
an accusation Tuesday that the United States had not met the terms
of the agreement because it had given no direct government aid for
reconstruction.
   Since the accord, Vietnam has received only two shipments of
prosthetic equipment, both from private agencies in the United
States.
   Some U.S. officials suspect the Vietnamese are trying to move
toward normal relations through government-to-government links on
the humanitarian aid issue.
   The United States has said frequently said it will not establish
diplomatic relations or lift its trade embargo until Vietnam makes
as full an accounting as possible of the MIAs and leaves Cambodia,
which it invaded in December 1978.
   Washington has sent investigative medical teams to Vietnam and
encouraged private aid, but has not lifted an embargo on official
aid imposed as a protest of the occupation.
   Hanoi has returned 152 remains the Army laboratories have
confirmed as those of MIAs. The previous largest transfer was on
Aug. 14, 1985, involving 26 sets of remains, at least 24 of which
were confirmed.

<TEXT>
   A judge today granted surrogate mother Mary
Beth Whitehead-Gould immediate, unsupervised visitation of eight
hours a week with the child she agreed to bear under a $10,000
contract.
   Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
visits with 2-year-old Melissa Stern would be expanded from one
eight-hour day weekly to two days every other week in September,
overnight visits in April 1989 and two weeks during that summer.
   ``The court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion that
Melissa will suffer any psychological or emotional harm by
continued and expanded visitation with her mother,'' Sween said.
   His order barred both sides in the case from discussing Melissa
publicly, such as in the promotion of books or movies.
   The Sterns had argued during a three-day visitation hearing last
week that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would use Melissa in a tour to
promote a book she is writing about the case.
   Sween's order doesn't not affect publication of Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's book, however, nor does it have any effect on a
television movie being made about the case.
   The judge also ordered the adults in the case to undergo
counseling to ease the emotional burden on the child, who lives
with her father, William Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth. The
Sterns, who hired Mrs. Whitehead-Gould as a surrogate, have custody
of Melissa
   ``The court finds that Melissa's best interests will be served
by unsupervised, uninterrupted liberal visitation with her
mother,'' Sween said in a written decision given to attorneys.
   ``She and her mother have the right to develop their own special
relationship,'' the judge said.
   In a statement issued by her attorneys, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould
said she was happy her relationship with her daughter ``has been
preserved.''
   ``I am delighted and grateful to know that as Melissa grows up,
we'll have a meaningful and substantial relationship with each
other,'' she said.
   The Sterns were disappointed by the decision, said their
attorney, Gary Skoloff, noting that the Sterns had sought to delay
contact between Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and Melissa for several years.
   ``We did not get the hiatus we asked for,'' said Skoloff. ``They
were pleased with the mandatory counseling. And they were pleased
with the privacy issue.''
   He said the Sterns would make no public statement on the ruling.
   Skoloff had said following the three-day hearing last week that
the couple did not plan to appeal Sween's decision, whatever the
outcome.
   The Sterns argued that visitation should be stopped for at least
six years, while Mrs. Whitehead-Gould sought the gradually
expanded, unsupervised visitation she won today.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, an East Brunswick housewife who turns 31
Thursday, was allowed to visit the child for two hours once a week
under supervision during the legal battle.
   She testified during the custody hearing that her daughter would
benefit by a ``more natural'' relationship with her mother.
   The Sterns said they feared Mrs. Whitehead-Gould could
emotionally harm the child and try to undermine their relationship
with Melissa.
   If there is no appeal, today's ruling would bring to a close a
highly publicized, unprecedented court battle that sparked a
worldwide debate on parents' rights and reproductive technologies.
   The dispute began shortly after the child's birth March 31,
1986, when Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, then married to Richard Whitehead
and the mother of two, decided to turn down the $10,000 surrogacy
fee and refused to hand over the child. No money ever changed
hands. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould is now expecting her fourth child by
her second husband, Dean Gould.
   The Sterns turned to surrogacy because they feared Mrs. Stern,
42, who suffers from a mild form of multiple sclerosis, could
develop complications with the disease during pregnancy.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould fled with the baby to Florida for three
months before authorities tracked her down and returned the child
to the Sterns, setting the stage for the emotional court battle
over custody.
   After a three-month trial, Superior Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkow
upheld the surrogate contract and stripped Mrs. Whitehead-Gould of
her parental rights, ordering her never to see the child again. The
judge then presided over a speedy adoption of the child by Mrs.
Stern.
   But the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned most of Sorkow's
ruling in its landmark Feb. 3 ruling. The state's highest court
outlawed surrogacy-for-pay and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
parental rights, but upheld custody for the Sterns while ordering
the lower court hearing on visitation rights.

   An alleged cocaine trafficker wanted for
questioning in the slaying of a U.S. drug agent was imprisoned
today in the maximum-security federal penitentiary at Marion, Ill.,
authorities said, after being picked up in a pre-dawn helicopter
raid at his home in Honduras.
   Juan Ramon Matta, 43, was lodged in a cell at Marion, which the
federal prison system uses to house its most dangerous criminals,
said Kathryn Morse, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.
   Matta was taken by U.S. marshals to Marion early today after
Honduran police arrested him at his home in Tegucigalpa early
Tuesday and put him on a flight headed for the Dominican Republic
without a passport, U.S. law enforcement sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He was arrested by U.S. marshals aboard a New York-bound
jetliner after being kicked out of the Dominican Republic by
officials who had been informed that he was wanted in the United
States, authorities reported.
   In addition to drug charges, the Drug Enforcement Administration
wants to question him about the 1985 murder in Mexico of DEA agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar. According to one U.S. law enforcement
source, DEA agents have already interviewed Matta briefly since his
arrival in the United States.
   Camarena was kidnapped, tortured and killed in Guadalajara,
Mexico, in a slaying allegedly ordered by drug traffickers. John C.
Lawn, the head of the DEA, said that Matta was one of the four
prime suspects in the case.
   The successful taking into U.S. custody of Matta was the result
of more than a month of sensitive negotiations between Honduran and
U.S. officials, a U.S. law enforcement source said today.
   Howard Safir, the chief of operations for the Marshals Service,
spent the last three to six weeks in Honduras spearheading the
effort to get Matta into the hands of the United States, said the
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Honduran government sources said that President Jose Azcona Hoyo
met with top civilian and security officials to discuss Matta's
case.
   According to other U.S. law enforcement sources, Matta was taken
into custody by Honduran police in the airborne helicopter raid on
a warrant signed by a city judge.
   Matta's wife, Nancy Vasquez, said that police and the judge had
placed bag of cocaine on the table in their house and said they had
found it there. She said there had been no drugs at the residence.
   Carlos Lorenzana, Matta's lawyer, said in a telephone interview
that about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at
his client's home at 5:45 a.m. Tuesday.
   ``Matta was stunned'' by the raid, said a U.S. law enforcement
source. ``He couldn't believe it.''
   Matta had been living openly in Honduras after escaping in 1986
from a Colombian prison.
   He had been held in Colombia on charges of involvement with the
Medellin cartel, the world's largest cocaine-trafficking
organization.
   Lorenzana said Matta, as a Honduran citizen, could not be
extradited to the United States ``because the constitution forbids
it.''
   The Marshals Service said the expulsion from the Dominican
Republic was based on a U.S. warrant for Matta after he escaped
from Eglin Federal Prison Camp in Florida in 1971. He was serving a
five-year sentence for illegally entering the United States and
using a fraudulent visa.
   Matta arrived at New York's Kennedy International Airport early
today on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Lt. Kevin Ward
of the Port Authority police.
   He was accompanied by three federal marshals who put him aboard
a government jet.
   Warrants charge Matta with escape from federal custody,
conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, possession with intent to distribute
cocaine, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other
crimes.
   ``This arrest is a major milestone in our worldwide assault on
illegal drug trafficking,'' Stanley E. Morris, director of the U.S.
Marshals Service in Washington, said Tuesday.
   The Marshals Service said Matta was believed to have become a
leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of
illegal drugs from Mexico.
   U.S. authorities link Matta's return to Honduras to an increase
in transshipment of Colombian cocaine through the Central American
country.
   Allegations have been made of involvement by top Honduran
military officials.
   The government denied the reports in February. Azcona said
critics were trying ``to discredit the armed forces and my
government, which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug
traffickers.''
   Matta told The Associated Press in February he makes his living
in cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, spice and coffee
trade. His wealth has been estimated at up to $2 billion, but he
put it at about $5 million.
   He said the charges against him were ``a lie, a story,'' and
claimed U.S. agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap
him.
   Matta said then he never again would leave Honduras. ``If I
appear in the United States, it is a kidnapping by American agents.
If I am killed, it is the DEA,'' he said at the time.

   David Ruffin, former lead singer of the
Temptations, was released Wednesday after spending a night in jail
on a charge of cocaine possession.
   Ruffin, 46, was arraigned Tuesday before Magistrate Vesta
Svenson on a charge of possession with intent to distribute less
than 20 grams of cocaine. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 20
years in prison.
   Officials said Ruffin was in the basement of a house when a
pouch containing suspected cocaine residue and personal papers with
his name was found on a kitchen table.
   Ruffin posted a $1,500 surety, or $150 cash, bond, said Nancy
Mouradian, Wayne County sheriff's spokeswoman.
   The Temptations recorded dozens of hits including ``My Girl,''
``Ain't Too Proud to Beg'' and ``(I Know I'm) Losing You.''

   Bloomingdale's annual spring party may have been
titled ``Hooray for Hollywood,'' but the star of the show was
Robert Campeau from Canada.
   Just days ago, Toronto-based developer Campeau won a takeover
battle with R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. for Bloomingdale's parent company,
Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin Traub gave Campeau and his wife,
Ilse, a tour of the chain's flagship Manhattan store Tuesday during
a star-studded party to preview its new promotional theme.
   The $350-a-person dinner also was to benefit the American
Foundation for AIDS Research.
   Campeau, who made shop talk as the group walked through bed
linens and crystal, chose to drink water rather than champagne.
   ``New York tap water is the best,'' he said. ``That's a known
fact.''
   Among the nearly 1,000 other party guests were Lauren Hutton,
Jane Seymour, Jaclyn Smith, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Iman, Bob
Mackie, Norma Kamali, Susan Sarandon, Pat Kennedy Lawford, Fawn
Hall, Calvin and Kelly Klein, and Brooke Shields.

   The picture is signed ``Bangkok River, C.'88.'' It was done in
February when the prince stayed in Thailand for five days after
Princess Diana returned home from celebrations of King Bhumibol's
60th birthday.
   The painting, and another done last April when Charles visited
the Serengeti Plain in East Africa, are in the annual exhibition of
the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolors.
   ``The prince takes his paints everywhere he goes,'' said Charles
Bone, president of the institute. ``He is very capable. Of course,
he has very little opportunity in that tight schedule of his, but
if he had a lot of time he would be very good.''
   Unlike the rest of the 700 paintings in the exhibition, the

   Jerry Brown, whose unorthodox style
and ideas made him one of the nation's hot young politicians in the
1970s, celebrates his 50th birthday Thursday the way he has spent
most of the last six years _ in private.
   Brown has been dropping hints in recent months that he plans a
comeback, possibly a race for the U.S. Senate in 1992. But he says
the time is not yet right to seek the media spotlight again.
   Therefore, he vetoed plans by a group of friends and supporters
for a birthday celebration this week at a Los Angeles hotel with
1,000 to 1,500 guests.
   ``It's just not the right time,'' Brown told reporters. ``If I
were more active in the public domain, then it might be
appropriate.''
   Instead, Brown will celebrate Thursday with what he describes as
a small family gathering.
   Reclusiveness has been Brown's way since he lost a race for the
U.S. Senate six years ago to Republican Pete Wilson. He has spent
most of the past six years traveling, with especially long stays in
Mexico and Japan, and writing a still-unfinished book.
   That defeat ended eight years in which Brown was constantly in
the media spotlight with two successful races for governor, two
unsuccessful campaigns for the Democratic nomination for president
and the Senate race.
   Brown chafed at the constant attention even during the campaign
periods when he was working hardest to attract coverage, and he
seemed to be genuinely relieved at his close defeat in the Senate
race. ``The people ... would like a respite from me, and in some
ways, I need a respite from them,'' he said in his concession
speech.
   Even in that speech, Brown said he planned to return to
political life eventually.
   In a long interview four months ago, Brown told The Associated
Press that he still plans to return to politics. He refused to cite
a specific race but as he ruled out various options in response to
questions, he eliminated nearly everything except running for the
Senate if Democrat Alan Cranston retires in 1992.
   On personal subjects, Brown was as evasive as ever, confirming
only that marrying and raising a family ``is on my mind ... but it
hasn't happened yet.''
   Brown is spending part of his time practicing what he described
as ``business law'' with a large Los Angeles firm. He declined to
discuss that except to say that it involves ``a number of things
I've learned in government I can help clients with.''

   A Roman Catholic bishop, formerly imprisoned for
30 years for loyalty to the Vatican, has won permission to seek
medical treatment in the United States, a state-supported church
group said Wednesday.
   The Shanghai municipal government and the state-sanctioned
Patriotic Catholic Church decided to let Bishop Ignatius Kung, also
known as Gong Pinmei, to make the trip, according to Liu Bainian, a
spokesman for the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.
   Kung, 87, of Shanghai, has a hearing problem and suffers
cardiovascular ailments.
   Liu provided no details on where and when Kung will seek
treatment.
   Kung was released from prison in 1985 and says he remains loyal
to the pope. He disavows the Patriotic Catholic Church, which
severed ties with the Vatican in 1957 and ordains its own bishops.
   Kung, appointed prelate of the Shanghai diocese by Rome in 1950,
was arrested in 1955 on charges of treason and sentenced to life
imprisonment for leading ``a counterrevolutionary clique under the
cloak of religion.''
   He was released following campaigns by international religious
and human rights groups and an appeal from the Vatican.

   A U.S. auction company will return 10

years ago, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
   Numismatic Fine Arts International Inc. in Los Angeles already
has handed over the Lycian coins to the Turkish consulate there, a

   The Turkish government said the coins were dug up illegally in
the Mediterranean coastal village of Elmali. It gave no information

rest of the collection are unknown.
   Turkey has long been a popular hunting ground for smugglers of
antiques with its sites of more than a dozen ancient civilizations,
including Hittite, Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine.
   Turkey has stepped up efforts to retrieve some of its treasures
from foreign musuems. The government filed suit against the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York last year for the return of
a 2,600-year-old collection of gold and silver antique pieces.

   Ammunition exploded at a base for

according to an official report.
   The blast occurred at the Veszprem base about 60 miles southwest
of Budapest, injuring ``several people, including one Hungarian

report.
   It added only that ``the consequences of the explosion have been

   There were no details about how the ammunition came to explode,
where the incident occurred or how many people were hurt.
   Veszprem is the largest Soviet troop base in Hungary. There are
an estimated 100,000 Soviet soldiers stationed in the Warsaw Pact
nation.
   Gyula Horn, a senior official of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry,
told Western reporters last month that there have been talks about
withdrawing the Soviet forces. Horn said no agreement had been

<HEAD>New Technique Means Instant Breast Replacement for Cancer Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM E. SCHULZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new plastic surgery technique which moves fatty
tissue from the ``saddle bags'' area of the thigh offers victims of
breast cancer another option in reconstruction surgery, says the
surgeon who developed it.
   Medical science may someday eliminate breast cencer, said
Franklyn Elliott, an Atlanta plastic surgeon. ``But in the
meantime, we can take the fear out of the surgery. People won't be
so terrified. It won't be maiming to so many people.''
   The procedure developed by Elliott and his associate Dr. Philip
H. Beegle Jr., has been performed just four times at St. Joseph's
Hospital of Atlanta. The first was in December.
   After diseased cancerous tissue is removed, plastic surgeons
implant the fatty tissue and the artery that feeds it to replace
the lost breast tissue.
   The surgeons connect the artery and vein in the thigh tissue
into an artery and vein in the armpit area. The plastic surgeons
use a small piece of skin from the thigh to replace the areola and
nipple, which are removed as part of the cancer surgery.
   When the patient wakes up, she has two breasts, both of which
are her own tissue.
   For years, cancer patients who had to have breasts removed could
only wear a padded bra after the surgery. Then doctors developed
implants to replace the lost tissue. In the 1980s, a variety of
replacement surgeries were developed, using the patient's own
tissue from the abdomen or the buttock.
   ``We went to work in the lab and found this pocket of tissue
that is fairly easily removed and has its own blood supply,'' said
Beegle. ``It gives the patient another option.''
   Today's options for a breast cancer patient include breast
removal or, if the cancer is detected very early, the tumors can be
removed in a ``lumpectomy'' which is followed by radiation
treatment.
   If the treatment is a mastectomy, removal of the breast and
lymph nodes, the patient can select from several forms of
reconstruction, including a combination of her own tissue and a
small implant, Elliott said.
   Arthur Holleb, a former breast cancer surgeon and now chief
medical officer for the American Cancer Society in New York, said
breast cancer can bring psychological problems.
   ``The impact of the psychosocial decision is tremendous,'' he
said in a telephone interview from his office. The society, he
said, has a visitation program in hospitals which assists 70,000
breast cancer patients each year.
   ``The anxiety varies from woman to woman. The breast is so
important to most women,'' said John Bostwick, nationally known
plastic surgeon from Emory University.
   ``It's such a shock to a young woman to have a breast cancer,
particularly if she is young and healthy, and the treatment is
going to do a lot to hurt her feminity,'' he said. ``We find if we
can tell them we can do a reconstruction, it helps.''
   The replacement with ``saddle bags'' tissue is an easier
operation than replacement from the buttocks, Beegle said.
   ``I think their technique is very innovative for selected women.
It's going to be very worthwhile,'' Bostwick said.
   ``For the woman who doesn't have a lot of tissue in the abdomen,
it provides another alternative to to find the tissue'' for
reconstruction.
   In one patient, who lost both breasts, ``we used tissue from the
abdomen on one side and from the hip on the other,'' Elliott said.
``It allows us to have the luxury of the option.''
   Only about 10 percent of 15 percent of the breast cancer
patients in the Atlanta area now seek reconstruction, but the
number is increasing, the surgeons said.
   Early detection of breast cancer, through self-examination and
mammograpny has lowered the age of breast cancer patients, they
said, meaning the patient is more likely to seek reconstruction.
   This procedure doesn't leave a scar on the abdomen and the
incision to remove the thigh tissues is concealed under the buttock
so after recovery ``the patient will feel comfortable in shorts, a
tennis dress or a bathing suit, the scar won't show,'' Elliott said.

<HEAD>Budapest Launches Strongest Criticism Yet on Romania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary on Wednesday launched its
strongest criticism yet on communist ally Romania over an ethnic
dispute that has clouded relations between the Warsaw Pact
neighbors for two years.
   Two Hungarian newspapers printed editorials fiercely critical of
a reported Romanian move to use only Romanian-language place names
for cities and villages traditionally known to Romania's German and
Hungarian ethnic minorities in their own languages.
   About 1.7 million Hungarians and 220,000 ethnic Germans live in
Romania, mostly in the central province of Transylvania. Hungary
has expressed mounting concern over what it says are Romanian moves
to cut back Hungarian-language education and disperse the minority
throughout Romania.
   Romania charges that Hungary's complaints mask an effort by
Budapest to regain Transylvania, which was ruled by Hungary for
several centuries but given to Romania after World War I.
   Both claim that Transylvania is the area where their nations
were first settled, and they have squabbled over the region for
decades.
   In the past two years, however, the dispute has escalated,
pointing up the difference between Hungary's reformist communism
and the tight rule of President Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania, which
is increasingly isolated from its East bloc allies.
   The government daily Magyar Hirlap said violations of minority
rights to maintain their own language and culture can ``neither be
understood, or accepted ... at the end of the 20th century on our
continent.''
   The harsh editorial stopped short of blaming Ceausescu for the
move to use only Romanian place names, but said ``it could hardly
be a local excess ... (since) to our knowledge the strings reach
much higher.''
   Another daily, Magyar Nemzet, condemned Ceausescu's recently
announced program to wipe out up to 7,000 villages in Romania by
the year 2000 as ``drastic ... demolition'' and an attempt to quash
Romanian, Hungarian and other minority cultures.
   Magyar Hirlap also took Romania to task for its unprecedented
action in denying Hungary's Bucharest ambassador a traditional
address on national radio and television to mark Hungary's
Liberation Day April 4.
   The newspaper noted this was a break with tradition, and said
without further detail that ``it is regrettable that such themes
can emerge between two neighboring Socialist countries.''
   Western analysts said Wednesday's attacks were the sharpest yet
in the war of words between the nations.
   Hungarian dissidents, who demonstrated for human rights in
Romania outside the Romanian Embassy in Budapest on Feb. 1, have
charged the Budapest government is to some extent exploiting
popular Hungarian unease about the treatment of ethnic Hungarians
in Romania to divert attention from the country's economic crisis.
   But Hungary took unprecedented action last month when it
approved spending about $6 million to help an estimated 10,000
refugees who have fled the shortages and harsh living conditions in
Romania for Hungary. Many but not all of the refugees are ethnic
Hungarians.

   The state Senate voted today to pay former
Gov. Evan Mecham's $202,433 in legal fees for the impeachment trial
that removed him from office.
   The 16-13 vote came shortly before the Senate formally closed
the impeachment trial that began Feb. 29 and resulted in Mecham's
ouster from office on Monday.
   Defense attorney Jerris Leonard had asked the Senate to begin a
``healing process'' by paying the fees.
   ``This has been an agony,'' Leonard said. ``I think it's the
right thing to do ... to show that this body not only has class,
but it has heart, it has compassion.''
   Republican Sen. Greg Lunn agreed, saying it would be a
``magnanimous gesture.''
   GOP Sen. Pat Wright said she thought Mecham's legal fees should
be paid because Arizona taxpayers funded the prosecution and trial,
and many ``resent deeply their tax dollars being used to convict a
governor that they supported.''
   However, Sen. John Mawhinney, also a Republican, argued against
paying the defense costs.
   ``We didn't start this process; the House of Representatives
didn't start this process'' when it impeached Mecham, Mawhinney
said. ``Evan Mecham, the governor, started the process.''
   Mawhinney said that if senators wanted to show compassion they
might want to pay the legal fees themselves, adding, ``I can't
believe you can do that with somebody else's money.''
   Democratic Sen. Chuy Higuera suggested that the state and Mecham
split the cost.
   The Senate voted Monday to remove Mecham, a first-term
Republican, from office for obstructing justice by trying to thwart
an investigation of an alleged death threat and for misusing
$80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership.
   GOP Sen. John Hays said he thought the matter should be referred
to the Legislature and suggested that the $92,000 governor's
protocol fund _ which remains in a bank _ might be used to pay
Mecham's expenses.
   Leonard said he expected to be paid whether the money came from
the state or Mecham himself.
   The attorney said that when he met with Mecham after his
conviction, ``I found not one sign of retribution in him of any
thought of revenge or rancor.''
   ``He said to us that when your first vote was completed ... that
he felt relieved,'' Leonard said.
   The prosecution took no position on whether Mecham's fees should
be paid. Prosecutor Paul Eckstein said the matter should be up to
the Senate's discretion.

<HEAD>S&L Deposits Up for Fifth Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposits at federally insured savings
institutions grew for the fifth consecutive month in February,
continuing a trend begun after the October stock market crash, the
government said Wednesday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates 3,126 savings
institutions, said net deposits increased by $5.2 billion, compared
with a $5.4 billion increase in January and a $1.1 billion net
withdrawal in February 1987.
   The increase came despite the deteriorating financial condition
of many thrift institutions, particularly in Texas where
institutions have been hit hard by the depressed energy and real
estate markets.
   A third of the industry lost money last year, pushing overall
1987 losses to a post-Depression record of $6.8 billion.
   Despite the losses, money has been flowing into S&L accounts,
which are insured up to $100,000, since the crash: $6.2 billion in
October, $3.2 billion in November, and $2.6 billion in December.
   That is reversing what was described as a slow-motion run on
S&Ls, which had net withdrawals in seven of the first nine months
of last year.
   ``I think you're still getting, as late as it seems, a kind of
stock market effect here,'' said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with
the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largest
trade group.
   ``Although the stock market hasn't declined since October, it
hasn't gone up much either. A lot of consumers are rethinking what
they're doing with their money and parking some or all of it into
thrifts and perhaps banks,'' he said.
   Unlike the early months after the crash, which saw an increase
in deposits of $100,000 and more, the increase so far in 1988 has
come in smaller accounts, which are institutions' least costly
source of funds.
   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the bank board said interest
rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages fell from 10.48 percent in
early February to 10.34 percent in early March, the lowest since
last April.
   Rates on the most popular type of one-year adjustable mortgages,
those with caps on how much the rate can change, fell less sharply,
from 8.72 percent to 8.65 percent.
   The bank board figures do not reflect the most recent nudge
upward in interest rates. According to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have edged up from
9.84 percent on Feb. 12, the low for this year, to 10.05 percent on
April 1. This survey did not include add-on fees, known as points,
which are included in the bank board averages.
   Mortgage lending by S&Ls rose slightly to $13.5 billion in
February from $13.1 billion in January, which was the lowest level
since February 1985, the bank board said.

   Teams of weather scientists will be cruising
the Pacific Ocean over the next four months, but it's all for
research.
   Heat and moisture from the oceans have a major impact on weather
and climate. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
scientists want to learn more about how the air and water interact.
   The first leg of the work is under way, with the team sailing
from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to Samoa.
   Scientists are measuring the amounts of carbon dioxide, carbon
monoxide, methane and other gases in Pacific surface waters and the
overlying air.
   Similar sampling was done in 1983, and the new study will allow
comparison of the changes in these gases.
   Concentrations of the gases in the upper atmosphere can prevent
heat from sunlight from being reflected out into space, possibly
leading to a warming known as the Greenhouse effect, according to
Tim Bates of the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle.
   At the same time the scientists will sample sulfur gases and
look for aerosols in the sea and air.
   These chemicals could increase the reflective power of the
clouds over the ocean, reducing the amount of sunlight and heat
reaching the surface.
   At Samoa, a second team of scientists will board the research
ship Oceanographer to begin a study of the periodic changes in
ocean temperature and air pressure known as the El Nino phenomenon.
   The El Nino has been blamed for unusual changes in weather
around the world, but scientists are not sure how these effects
occur.
   During a cruise from Samoa to Panama via Honolulu they will
measure air pressure and ocean currents and temperature, all
factors which appear to play a role.
   In addition they will perform maintenance on an array of moored
and drifting sensors which collect weather data and send the
information back via satellite.
   Joining the NOAA meteorologists on the first leg of the trip are
scientists from the University of Washington, Washington State
University and the University of Hawaii.
   On the second leg will be researchers from the University of
Washington, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, University of South
Florida and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.

<NOTE>EDs: New thruout with Fitzwater comment on Reagan remark; No

<TEXT>
   White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater today described as ``a throwaway remark'' a comment by
President Reagan indicating approval of the notion of pardoning
indicted former aide Oliver North.
   Reagan did not say that he would pardon former White House aides
or others accused in the Iran-Contra affair. But, after hearing a
proposal for pardons, he did say ``I like the sound of those
words,'' said one congressman quoted in The Washington Post.
   Another congressman quoted Reagan as saying, ``I like hearing
what you said,'' after Rep. Henry J. Hyde suggested the president
should pardon North and former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter at the end of Reagan's term.
   Hyde, R-Ill., suggested the pardons be signed during ceremonies
at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, according to the
Post.
   During a briefing for reporters at this seaside resort, not far
from Reagan's ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains, Fitzwater was
questioned about the president's intentions.
   ``I was there at that meeting, and Henry Hyde said he hoped that
North would be pardoned, and the president told him he is not
discussing pardons at this time,'' the spokesman said.
   ``And then there was some throwaway line, and I didn't give it
any significance then or at this time,'' Fitzwater said. ``I don't
believe you should make any assumptions or conclusions on the basis
of a throwaway remark.''
   Fitzwater said he could not remember Reagan's precise words, but
he did not dispute the quote attributed to Reagan.
   ``I have raised the issue with the president four or five times,
and every time he has said he wasn't discussing pardons,'' the
spokesman said.
   Hyde's proposal and Reagan's response reportedly were made March
22 during the president's appearance before the House Republican
Conference, a closed meeting attended by 160 of the 177 GOP House
members.
   The Post said the congressmen who quoted the president asked not
to be identified since it was a closed session.
   The Post quoted one congressman as saying he felt the
president's message was unmistakable and ``If I had been Ollie and
witnessed that, I would have been pretty upbeat.''
   The meeting occurred six days after North and Poindexter, along
with arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert A. Hakim, pleaded
innocent to federal criminal charges in the sale of arms to Iran
and the diversion of money to Contra rebels fighting the government
of Nicaragua.
   Three days later, Reagan predicted Poindexter and North would be
found innocent ``because I don't think they were guilty of any
lawbreaking or any crime.'' Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the
Center for the Study of the Presidency, Reagan called the
Iran-Contra affair ``the so-called scandal'' and said he still
considered North ``a hero.''
   The president later said he was referring to North's combat in
Vietnam.
   Fitzwater said a day after the indictments that there had been
no discussion of pardons. ``We don't discuss pardons. Period,''
Fitzwater said.
   Chief of staff Howard H. Baker later said Reagan would not
consider pardons until after North and Poindexter are tried.
   Fitzwater said today he had not been aware of Baker's remarks.

   One man's junk is another man's gold mine.
   A man was ordered to pay a fine or go to jail after a jury found
he violated zoning law by keeping eight Model-A Fords in his yard.
   ``Some people call it junk. I probably have $25,000 worth of
junk here,'' said Rawley Patton, who lost his case Tuesday in
magistrate's court.
   The six-person jury deliberated for 14 minutes after a two-hour
trial. Patton, who acted as his own attorney, was given the choice
of a $168 fine or 21 days in jail, and said he would pay the fine
and appeal ``until we have justice done.''
   Patton, 63, said the eight antique cars are being stripped to
make four or five working cars.
   He was accused of violating an ordinance forbidding unlicensed
or uninspected cars from being parked on residential lots.

   Chinese authorities have arrested 203 people
for illegal hunting of the endangered giant panda and recovered 146
pelts, representing about one in seven of all pandas alive at the
last count, the World Wildlife Fund said Wednesday.
   ``These are shocking revelations,'' William Reilly, president of
the fund's U.S. affiliate, said in a statement. ``The situation
appears to be worsening for the panda,'' with the march to
extinction more advanced than previously believed and hunting the
greatest threat.
   Reilly said it was the first time China had released such
detailed statistics.
   China's last public estimates of the panda population were made
in 1976 _ about 1,000 animals. Another survey is under way this
year, and results have been announced only for the Wolong Nature
Preserve _ 145 animals in 1976, 72 now.
   Chinese authorities up to now have said poaching at been
controlled, though the possibility of the death penalty for
poachers was announced last fall, the fund said.
   Forestry Minister Gao Dezhan announced the arrest statistics in
February. He reportedly said 150 people still were sought in
connection with an investigation into poaching and fur trading in
Sichuan Province in western China, where almost all pandas live.
   Twenty-six people have been sentenced to prisons terms ranging
from a year to life, Dezhan was quoted as saying.
   Some pandas are believed caught in snares set for another
endangered species, the Asian musk deer, whose oil is valued in
traditional Asian medicine.
   Panda furs fetch high prices when smuggled to Hong Kong or Japan.
   Spokesman Ken Cook said a fund representative, Chris Elliott,
saw accounts of Dezhan's speech in a Beijing newspaper on Feb. 27,
but had been traveling and unable to confirm the figures with
Chinese officials until recently.
   The panda is a shy mammal that looks like a black-and-white bear
but is believed by many zoologists _ not all _ to be closely
related to the raccoon. It has been known to be under severe strain
as its forest habitat retreated under farming pressure.
   The panda eats only certain kinds of bamboo found in the forest.
   So little was known about the panda that it was not classified
as an endangered species until 1984.
   The fund said it was renewing its Ferbuary request to the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service to deny import permits for short-term
exhibitions of pandas in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit and Toledo
this year.
   David Klinger, spokesman for the service, said applications had
been received only from organizations in Detroit and Toledo.
   The service, he said, will make no decisions on the permits
until it gets information from the Chinese government on whether
the exhibitions affect the population in the wild and the captive
breeding population in Chinese zoos and whether rental payments
from the exhibitions are being used to benefit the species.

   An empty commuter train slammed into
the back of another empty train during Wednesday's morning rush
hour, killing a railroad engineer, injuring two other workers and
shutting down the busy New Haven line.
   The lead car of the moving eight-car train vaulted up into the
overhead lines and came to rest on the rear car of the five-car
train which had been stopped about a mile west of the Mount Vernon
station.
   Metro-North spokesman Dan Brucker said it took more than an hour
to extricate the body from the wreck.
   The crash delayed thousands of passengers who commute to Grand
Central Terminal.
   The New Haven line handles 28,900 commuters each morning.
Commuters were taken Wednesday by shuttle bus from the New Rochelle
station on the New Haven line to the Mount Vernon West station on
the Harlem line, which was not affected.
   The two injured Metro-North workers were brought to Mount Vernon
Hospital, said Pat Quaglieri, secretary for the director of public
relations at the facility. Conductor Anthony Paturzo, 58, and
Joseph Vanacore, 34, who suffered a broken leg, were in good
condition, she said.
   Two employees on the stopped train and two from the second train
walked away uninjured, Gilbert said.
   All four were being interviewed by investigators, she said. All
six surviving employees on the two trains, as well as three control
tower workers, were being tested for drugs and alcohol at Mount
Vernon Hospital, Gilbert said.

   Some 800 Marines are going to
Panama for training exercises, but the troop movement is not
related to the U.S. military security build-up prompted by Panama's
political turmoil, the White House said today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Marines, from
Camp Pendleton near San Diego, will begin arriving in Panama Friday
at an American jungle operations training center.
   ``This should not be confused with the current security
enhancement in Panama'' involving the deployment of about 1,300
troops earlier this week, Fitzwater said.
   He said the 800 Marines are scheduled to take three weeks of
training, but did not say whether a similar number is leaving
Panama.
   ``There's a constant turnover of training exercises,'' he said.
``They will be there for three weeks and then they will come out.
The only reason we announced this ... was so we could emphasize
that it was not related to the security build-up in the (U.S.)
Southern Command.''
   Administration officials are increasingly frustrated with the
failure of U.S. economic sanctions to dislodge Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the president's national security adviser
said Tuesday.
   Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, briefing reporters during Reagan's
vacation near here, would not rule out the possibility of sending
more American troops to Panama, beyond the additional 1,300
dispatched this week, as the United States considers new steps to
force out Noriega.
   Powell would not say how long U.S. officials would wait for the
sanctions to work.
   Powell said the administration continues to weigh military,
political and economic options, but he refused to comment on recent
reports saying a possible Noriega kidnapping had been discussed.
   ``There has been a lot of speculation about positions that
various parts of the administration hold on different subjects,''
he said during Tuesday's briefing, ``but it's really nothing until
the president calls it.''
   Noriega has clung to power despite the economic sanctions,
strikes in his country and the continued presence in hiding of
deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle. The general has been
indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on drug-trafficking
charges.
   Powell voiced frustration with the impact so far of U.S.
economic sanctions including a freeze on Panamanian assets in this
country and withholding of payments to the Panama Canal Commission.
   He said that while the punitive measures ``are having a telling
effect'' on the Panamanian economy, ``they have not yet created
enough pressure to remove General Noriega. ... It hasn't been
sufficient to date.''
   Powell said officials are studying the implications of invoking
a law giving the U.S. government emergency power to seize tax
payments made to Panama by American businesses with operations
there.
   ``We have to be cautious before you invoke IEEPA (International
Emergency Economic Powers Act),'' he said, ``because it is a very
powerful tool.''
   ``The staff back in Washington is examining the pros and cons of
invoking IEEPA, and if it is a sensible thing to do to continue to
apply pressure on General Noriega, then we will provide that to the
president for his consideration.''
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it may not be possible to persuade U.S. businesses
to withhold the tax payments voluntarily.
   He said some businesses ``are having difficulty because of their
need to operate in Panama and because of what they believe are
their legal obligations.''
   This official also said that invoking the emergency powers law
could damage the Panamanian economy beyond recovery in any
post-Noriega era, saying ``we might regret it several months from
now.''
   Powell and State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said they
had no evidence to back up a Washington Times report Tuesday saying
that an international Marxist brigade of up to 1,200 troops had
been sent into Panama late last month to protect Noriega.
   ``There are indications that there have been some Cuban arms
that have been flown into Panama in recent weeks, but I have no
information supporting the presence of an international brigade,''
said Powell.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev flew to the Central Asian
city of Tashkent under unusually tight security Wednesday to meet
with Afghan leader Najib, apparently to work out a Soviet troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The official Tass news agency reported that Gorbachev left
Moscow in midafternoon, but waited more than six hours before
announcing that he would meet with Najib. No other details were
provided, and even Soviet photographers were not allowed to cover
the departure or arrival of Gorbachev's plane.
   Also flying to Tashkent was Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, who had been in Kabul for the past four days to work
out a plan to pull out Soviet troops in the event that formal
negotiations in Geneva fail to produce an accord to end the
10-year-old war.
   Tass said Shevardnadze and Najib flew to Tashkent after their
talks, but the wording suggested they traveled separately.
   Tashkent, capital of the Uzbek republic, is about 450 miles
north of Kabul and about 1,700 miles southeast of Moscow.
   The unusual meeting place apparently was a compromise on
protocol, which would make it unsuitable for Najib, who is head of
state as well as party leader, to be summoned to Moscow for talks
with Gorbachev.
   Security concerns would prohibit Gorbachev from traveling to
Afghanistan, where guerrillas have used their U.S.-supplied Stinger
missiles to shoot planes out of the sky.
   Guerrillas aided by Pakistan and the United States have been
fighting the Kremlin-backed Kabul government since an April 1978
revolution brought communists to power in the Moslem state.
   The current round of the U.N.-mediated Geneva talks, which began
on March 2, has been stalled by a disagreement between negotiators
for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which represents the insurgents at
the talks, over continued foreign aid to the warring sides.
   The United Staes contends that if the Geneva accords call for an
end to American military aid to the guerrillas when the Soviet
pullout begins, the Kremlin also should have to halt arms supplies
to the Kabul government.
   Soviet officials claim aid to Afghanistan is a bilateral issue
outside the range of the Geneva talks.
   While the Americans are not officially represented at the
negotiations, their refusal to go along with the terms of a peace
agreement could render it ineffective.
   Diego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator at the Geneva talks, told
reporters he is still awaiting a response from Moscow and
Afghanistan on the aid issue. Progress at the latest round of talks
has been ``slow but steady,'' he said.
   A member of the Pakistani delegation said ``all parties agree
they are near agreement,'' while another diplomatic source
cautioned it was ``a little premature'' to consider the superpower
standoff settled. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. and Pakistani officials said publicly Tuesday that a
resolution may be only days away.
   Shevardnadze flew to Kabul on Sunday and told Tass upon arrival
that the United States and Pakistan had frustrated the Geneva talks
by insisting on ``symmetry'' _ the simultaneous cutoff by both
superpowers of assistance to the Afghan combatants.
   In New Delhi, India on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci renewed the call for ``symmetry.'' He told a news
conference before flying to Islamabad, Pakistan, that the Soviets
have so far rejected the American proposal for such a moritorium.
   ``We are exploring other options,'' he said, but gave no details.
   Gorbachev said Feb. 8 that if the Geneva agreement was signed by
March 15, Soviet soldiers would start pulling out May 15. He also
said the withdrawal could be completed within nine months, with
most of the Soviet soldiers removed within three months.
   While the deadline has passed, Soviet officials have asserted
the troop pullout will begin this year anyway, with or without a
Geneva agreement.
   Shevardnadze said Sunday he would work out the details of the
pullout, focusing on Afghan and Soviet concerns, in case the Geneva
process fails.
   Gorbachev's meeting with Najib may have been necessary because
of disagreements between the two governments over terms of the
Soviet withdrawal.
   While Najib's leadership is closely allied with the Kremlin,
there are likely sharp differences over how and when to reduce the
Soviet fighting power while protecting Afghan officials from a
bloody takeover by the guerrillas.
   Soviet soldiers entered the war on Dec. 27, 1979, and an
estimated 115,000 remain in Afghanistan to help Najib's army fight
off the insurgents.
   At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Deputy Foreign Minister
Vladimir F. Petrovsky said that a pullout would begin two months
after completion of an agreement in Geneva, but noted that the
terms could be revised if the troops are to be withdrawn under a
Soviet-Afghan pact.
   Petrovsky refused to disclose details of the four days of talks
between Shevardnadze and Najib.
   While in Islamabad, Carlucci is to meet with Pakistan President
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo, and
discuss aid to the guerrillas. On Thursday, he is to fly by
helicopter to the Khyber Pass, the gateway to Afghanistan 185 miles
west of Islamabad.

<HEAD>Redgrave, BSO Clash On Whether Actress Deserves Damages For
Cancellations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vanessa Redgrave deserves damages from the Boston
Symphony Orchestra because its cancellation of her performances
after receiving protest threats violated her civil rights, her
attorney told a federal appeals court Wednesday.
   A symphony attorney, however, countered that Massachusetts law
allowed the symphony to cancel the performances because of concerns
over artistic integrity stemming from threatened distruptions by
people opposed to Redgrave for her support of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The arguments were heard by a full five-member panel of the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which must decide whether to order a
lower court judge to consider awarding Redgrave additional damages
for civil rights violations.
   The justices gave no indication of when they would rule.
Redgrave did not attend the hearing.
   A three-member appeals panel in October ruled the symphony
violated Redgrave's rights in canceling the 1982 performances. The
court then granted the symphony's motion asking for full court
review of the 2-1 decision.
   The symphony had hired Redgrave to narrate six performances of
Stravinsky's ``Oedipus Rex'' at Boston, Tanglewood in western
Massachusetts, and New York's Carnegie Hall.
   But it canceled the concerts after receiving letters and phone
calls indicating there would be picketing and other protests
because of Redgrave's support of the PLO. Trial testimony also
indicated symphony officials were warned that allowing Redgrave to
perform might cause it to lose some of its financial support from
the Jewish community.
   In November 1984, a federal jury ruled the symphony had breached
its contract with Redgrave and awarded her the $27,500 she was to
have received for the performances plus $100,000 in compensatory
damages for work Redgrave said she lost because of the action.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Keeton threw out the $100,000 award
in February 1985 and ruled the symphony had not violated her civil
rights. The appeals court last October restored $12,000 of that
award _ the amount Redgrave would have been paid for a Broadway
role she lost during the suit against the symphony.
   At Wednesday's hearing, attorney Daniel J. Kornstein said the
symphony violated Redgrave's First Amendment right of free speech
in canceling a non-political performance because of her political
views.
   ``It's the public, in deciding whether or not to purchase
tickets, which will determine the artistic intregrity _ in deciding
whether to come or not,'' Kornstein argued.
   But symphony attorney Robert E. Sullivan argued that the
protests would have prevented the symphony from presenting
``Oedipus Rex'' in the format it desired, and that it has a First
Amendment right to decide what shows it will present.
   ``This decision is at the core of what the First Amendment is
all about,'' said Sullivan, who referred to language in
Massachusetts law that makes artistic integrity a valid defense in
canceling a performance.

<HEAD>Jackson Says His Base is Broadening, Dukakis Has Copied Message</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Jesse Jackson put the best face
Wednesday on his loss in the Wisconsin presidential primary, saying
he has broadened his base with ``a dramatic increase in support
from whites.''
   Jackson also said the Wisconsin victor, Michael Dukakis, has
adopted his message because it has proven popular with voters.
   ``You look at the basic message formation now, even of our
rival, Mr. Dukakis, whose lead now is stop drugs, what he's done
about drugs, his lead now is save jobs, reinvest in America and
that's the right message. It's the clear Jackson message,'' Jackson
said here. Arizona Democrats hold caucuses on April 16.
   Jackson took heart from the estimated 25 percent of Wisconsin
white primary voters who exit polls said voted for him. In most of
the primaries to date, he has drawn about 10 percent of the white
vote.
   ``When we look at the results, we have an expanded support base
from among whites, a dramatic increase in support from whites,
strong support from inner city blacks,'' he said. ``When you look
at the demographics of Colorado and Milwaukee we broke through in
major ways, a historic breakthrough. Our campaign continues to
expand, continues to grow.''
   Jackson told reporters ``it is really premature to discuss what
will happen in June,'' if there is no clear-cut delegate leader
after the last primaries.
   But he said his showings to date indicate he is the people's
choice.
   ``Of 40 contests that have been run now, I've come in No. 1 or
No. 2 in 30 of them and I have a 250,000-plus popular vote lead and
so at this stage of the campaign I feel very good,'' he said.
   Jackson's claim is based on primary plus caucus votes. In
primary votes alone, Dukakis holds a lead.
   Jackson signaled Tuesday night that he planned to lay out more
details of his policies, after his vague statements drew criticism
in recent weeks.
   In Tempe, he outlined his plan for reducing the deficit and
paying for ``the dream'' _ his program of more domestic spending.
   He said $100 billion could be generated annually by 1993 to
reduce the deficit and pay for new programs by freezing Pentagon
spending at current levels and increasing taxes on individuals and
corporations.
   He said the tax rate for richest taxpayers should rise from 28
percent and 33 percent to 38.5 percent, a move he said would affect
the top 600,000 taxpayers. He said corporate taxes should move back
to the ``1970s level'' as a percentage of gross national product.
   ``Simply refusing to give the Pentagon an automatic allowance
for inflation would, over the five-year period, represent a
10-percent reduction in planned spending. This freeze is consistent
with keeping America strong,'' he said.
   He also listed other savings from changes in farm programs,
closing tax loopholes, including a limit on business entertainment
deductions, and taxes to ``discourage mergers and speculation.''
   He said some have recently estimated the cost of Jackson's
proposals for increased domestic spending at $50 billion to $100
billion a year. ``Some declaim that this is unimaginably large. It
is not,'' he said.

   On a June day nearly 300 years ago, two
young women were hanged in Salem village, and by the end of the
summer, colonists had executed 13 women and seven men convicted of
being witches.
   Now a sculptor is nearing completion of the first memorial
honoring the victims of the Salem witch hysteria of 1692.
   ``Tourists would ask me where the witch trial memorial was and I
would have to say, `I don't know,''' said artist Yiannis
Stefanakis, who began work on the statue in August 1986. ``Then I
found out there wasn't one. I decided that, after almost 300 years,
these unfortunate people should be remembered.''
   His 14-foot bronze statue depicting three sisters accused of
witchcraft is to be dedicated in October on Gallows Hill. He is
preparing the mold for bronze casting next month, and memorial
organizers are seeking contributions to cover the $300,000 needed
for foundry and mounting expenses.
   The organizers also need city approval for use of the site.
   Stefanakis said he selected the sisters _ Sarah Cloyce, Mary
Esty and Rebecca Nurse _ as subjects for the statue because they
embodied the irony of the witch trials. Most of those accused were
well-established members of the community and devoted church goers.
And only those who confessed their guilt in court were spared.
   Nurse, who was 71 when hanged in July 1692, was the only one of
the accused witches to be excommunicated. Esty was hanged along
with seven other people on Sept. 22, 1692, the final day of the
executions.
   Cloyce was awaiting execution but was reprieved and spent her
life trying to vindicate her sisters' reputations.
   The witch hysteria began with innocent gatherings of young girls
fascinated by the mystical lore of Tituba, a Caribbean slave of a
Salem clergyman. Two sisters were so aroused by the clandestine
meetings that they would cry and shake uncontrollably. Other girls,
ages 13 to 20, began to imitate the behavior to get attention.
   Asked to explain their affliction, the girls began to accuse
townspeople of witchcraft. Nearly 200 people, including a minister
and the wife of the governor, were charged.
   Curiously, Tituba and others who confessed were spared. Only
those who steadfastly proclaimed innocence were hanged. One man was
pressed to death with rocks.
   ``The Salem witch trials were not unique. There were others in
the colonies and England,'' said Anne Farnam, president of the
Essex Institute in Salem, which houses the original trial records.
``But Salem was by far the worst episode.''
   Farnam said a large witch trial memorial proposed in 1903 was
abandoned because of cost and lingering guilt.
   ``There were still some negative feelings about the trials,''
said Farnam. ``There are even still some who don't want to
acknowledge the trials, but after 300 years we've loosened up a
bit.''
   The Essex Institute keeps a log of descendants of the accused,
some of whom are expected to attend the statue unveiling.
   ``We wish there were more artifacts from the period, but I
really don't think they wanted to save anything,'' said Patty
MacLeod, director of the Salem Witch Museum. ``I think (the statue)
will serve well, if only as a reminder that nothing like this
happens again.''

   Gov. Bob Martinez is willing to spend
more on AIDS, but he also wants carriers who continue sexual
activity locked up to keep them from spreading the deadly disease.
   ``The time has come to quarantine those whose character and
conduct are a clear threat to society,'' Martinez told lawmakers
Tuesday in his State of the State address. ``AIDS carriers who
refuse to stop spreading this fatal disease should no more be
allowed to roam free than criminals armed with a deadly weapon.''
   The governor's press secretary, Jon Peck, said Wednesday that
Martinez hasn't finalized his proposal on detaining AIDS victims,
but the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, under the
governor's supervision, is pushing an effort to counsel AIDS
carriers and protect the public.
   The HRS proposal is modeled after a program in Minnesota,
department spokesman Ray Wise said.
   ``What do you do with the people who won't stop spreading
AIDS?'' asked Wise. ``We want them in a facility that can provide
counseling and where necesary the medical treatment they need.
   ``If you just arrest them and throw them in jail, you're giving
up on them.''
   Martinez has called for spending $20 million this year to fight
AIDS, which is expected to infect 32,000 Floridians by 1991. More
than 4,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been
reported in Florida since 1981.
   ``There are millions and millions of dollars for the thousands
of AIDS patients who need help,'' said Peck. ``But there is also a
small amount for that very small, but very dangerous group of AIDS
patients who knowingly go out and actively spread the disease.''
   That money would be used to renovate a wing of a state
tuberculosis hospital in Lantana to house about 26 AIDS patients.
HRS already has funds for a group home for teen-agers with AIDS and
the department has identified a small facility near Orlando that
would house six carriers.
   Bob Kunst, leader of the Miami-based Cure AIDS Now, said threats
to isolate carriers drive them underground rather than motivate
them to seek testing for the disease.
   The state already has a law permitting AIDS carriers to be
quarantined. The first time it was used was last June when HRS
obtained a court order to have a 14-year-old Pensacola boy locked
in a mental ward.
   That action drew objections from national gay and civil rights
leaders and HRS backed down and asked the judge to lift the order
nearly two weeks later.
   The agency, however, used juvenile laws to remove the boy from
the custody of his mother, placing him first in a community mental
health center and then with a foster family.
   Under the latest HRS proposals, police would be responsible for
arresting AIDS carriers and the courts would be responsible for
certifying they are a public health risk, said Wise.
   A first-time offender would be placed on probation with limited
activities and restricted associations. After a second arrest, the
carrier would be placed in an around-the-clock supervised living
arrangement similar to a halfway house.
   Finally, Wise said, incorrigibles would be committed, but in a
humane and dignified environment.

<HEAD>Friends Hospital Celebrates 175 Years As Facility for Mentally Ill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Quakers who founded Friends Hospital 175
years ago chose a site on the outskirts of Philadelphia so the
mentally ill could live and work in freedom from prying eyes and
barred windows.
   That was part of the philosophy the Quakers, led by Thomas
Scattergood, believed in when they opened the ``Asylum for Persons
Deprived of the Use of their Reason.'' The institution is observing
its anniversary this week.
   The ``moral treatment'' of the mentally ill was considered
revolutionary at a time when the insane were put in chains in
basements or on display for public amusement.
   ``Today, about every institution espouses `moral treatment',''
said Judith Kelius, the hospital's coordinator of community
relations. ``It was something that was accepted much more widely
after Friends opened.''
   The hospital was the first institution in the United States
exclusively for the mentally ill which was not under government
auspices.
   Believing that ``there's that of God in every person,'' the
Quakers' treatment included giving each patients as much
responsibility as possiblee and and giving each an occupation to
increase self-esteem.
   ``Just because you're sick doesn't mean you're useless,'' said
James Delaplane, today's director of the facility.
   The second non-Quaker director of the 11 who have served the
hospital, Delaplane said 70 percent of the Board of Managers and
Corporation members are Quakers, according to bylaws.
   ``It was set up to be Society of Friends dominated to assure the
philosophy and principles were adhered to,'' he explained.
   Scattergood founded the hospital after visiting the Retreat at
York, England, a hospital for the mentally ill founded by Quaker
William Tuke.
   ``Thomas Scattergood quite likely was a depressant himself,''
Delaplane said, noting descriptions of him as a ``melancholiac
person.''
   The original building, built in 1817 and used as administrative
offices now, gave each patient a room of his own with a window. Ms.
Kelius said planners for the building included a committee on light
and air.
   That tradition continues. Each patient has his or her own room,
though the bathroom is shared with one other patient.
   In 175 years, the hospital has added several buildings. The
Greystone House, once the director's residence, houses 13 patients
with long-term psychiatric illness in a program to teach daily
living skills.
   At the turn of the century, the Hygeia Building was constructed
for hydrotherapy, a treatment similar to a whirlpool with the
person wrapped in a towel-like material, according to Delaplane.
   Treatments that once included purging, bloodletting and spinning
a patient while seated in a chair were used at Friends Hospital,
but have been discarded.
   ``The medical approach ... changes with the vogue in medicine,''
Delaplane said. ``The moral treatment has not changed.''
   Patients have two hours daily of activity therapy which may
include occupational or recreational therapy, creative arts and
horticulture.
   The first year, Friends Hospital had 19 patients. In 1982, the
hospital expanded to 192 beds. Now, a day program with 24 people
allows patients to undergo the same treatment as regular patients,
but leave the hospital at night.
   At first, the Quakers only wanted to admit patients of their
faith and people who had not been ill for an extended period of
time. After finding that there were not enough patients to fill
beds, they opened up the facility to all faiths and long-term
illnesses.
   The 100-acre site of Friends Hospital in north Philadelphia is
no longer rural, but the hospital is still surrounded by open
areas, trees and gardens.
   ``With the development of the surrounding area, we've always had
a buffer,'' Delaplane explained. ``The fact of the open space has
been a community asset.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Prints Criticism of Itself</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper that published a pro-Stalin letter and
subsequently came under fire appeared Wednesday to be atoning for
its sin by reprinting a Pravda article that criticized its action.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya, the official daily of the Russian
republic's party and government, published the unusual
self-criticism on its entire second page. The newspaper did not
make any independent comment on the criticism originally published
Tuesday in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya also received a scolding from other Soviet
journalists.
   Grigory Y. Baklanov, editor in chief of the monthly literary
journal Znamya, accused the editors of Sovietskaya Rossiya of
lagging behind the times in publishing the letter advocating
Stalinism on March 13. Appearing at a news conference on
disarmament, Baklanov pointed to a clock that was two hours slow.
   ``We've got a clock in front of us. It shows, I don't know why,
half past nine. Probably there's something wrong with that clock
and that clock was used apparently in the article of Sovietskaya
Rossiya.''
   Baklanov praised Pravda for setting the record straight.
   ``Its moral position is flawless. Its philosophical position is
deep and serious. It reflects revolutionary thinking,'' he said.
   Pravda, in an editorial, sharply condemned those advocating the
repressive ways of Stalin that led to the deaths or exile of ``many
thousands'' of people and the ``administrative-command methods'' of
economic management that discouraged local initiative.
   The daily said the letter in Sovietskaya Rossiya, written by a
Leningrad teacher, was ``an attempt, little by little, to revise
party decisions.'' It said Sovietskaya Rossiya's publication of the
letter worked against Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's programs
of ``perestroika,'' or restructuring of society.
   Gorbachev acknowledged perestroika and his policy of
``glasnost'' _ more openness _ have generated controversy.
   ``Some are panicking. There are people who think everything is
collapsing. Just as in the beginning of this century `matter
vanished' in the perceptions of some people as a result of new
discoveries in physics, now it seems to some that socialism is
vanishing,'' Gorbachev told West German Socialist leader Willy
Brandt on Tuesday, according to the Tass news agency.
   Moscow News, a weekly that has been in the forefront of
glasnost, also joined the chorus of condemnation of Sovietskaya
Rossiya. It said opponents of perestroika ``were not bothered by
the fate of the country, the fate of socialism in the years of
repression or stagnation, which brought the country to the
threshold of a moral, ideological and economic crisis.''
   The comments appeared in this week's edition of the newspaper,
put out by the Union of Soviet Societies of Friendship and Cultural
Relations with Foreign Countries and Novosti Press Agency.
   In addition to a brief editorial, Moscow News also published a
letter from a Muscovite condemning the approach of ``firmness''
advocated in the Sovietskaya Rossiya letter. It also reported that
anonymous typewritten leaflets have been found in mailboxes warning
that perestroika will lead to ``economic catastrophe and social
shock _ and then to enslavement of the country by imperialistic
governments.''

   Elderly Americans with low incomes would be
burdened unreasonably by any energy tax increase that did not make
special provisions to shield them, two advocacy groups said
Wednesday.
   A report commissioned by The Villers Advocacy Associates and the
National Council of Senior Citizens said one or more energy taxes
``is likely to develop strong political support'' in the push to
reduce the federal deficit.
   The report urged that those favoring higher energy taxes
consider ``the impact that these energy taxes would have on the
poor and on other Americans living on fixed incomes.''
   ``Unlike those of us who may have become casual about our use of
energy, the elderly poor cannot readily adopt conservation
strategies because for the most part they are already conserving
wherever and however they can,'' the report said.
   The report, based on Census and Energy Department data, said
about 5.8 million elderly households with average annual incomes of
$5,300 have only $500 a year left in so-called discretionary income
after paying existing housing, food and home energy costs.
   ``The average low-income elderly household must pay for
clothing, medicine, transportation and other necessities on a
budget of less than $10 a week,'' it said. ``So a seemingly modest
energy tax that might be a minor annoyance to most consumers could
be a severe shock to the elderly poor.
   ``For affluent Americans, a new energy tax would be the
equivalent of a luxury excise tax: mildly irritating but
bearable.'' But for the elderly poor, such a tax ``would be a
calamity,'' the report said.
   ``If some sort of energy tax is enacted, and if that legislation
fails to provide special protections for the poor, millions of our
neediest citizens _ especially low-income seniors _ will suffer as
a result,'' said Ronald F. Pollack, director of the Villers
organization. ``An energy tax without low income protections will
be devastating to millions of persons.''
   Lawrence T. Smedley, director of the senior citizens council,
said, ``Clearly, any across-the-board energy taxes would leave the
poorest citizens with nothing but losing options.''

<HEAD>Senators Discuss Arms, Human Rights at Kremlin Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven U.S. senators met with Soviet defense
experts and scientists Wednesday and told them the issue of human
rights takes precedence over negotiations on conventional arms in
Europe, one of the senators said.
   The delegation from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources, led by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., met with deputy
Politburo member Pyotr Demichev, Col.-Gen. Nikolai Chervov and
academician Yevgeny Velikhov for discussions centered on security
and improving trust between the two superpowers.
   A Tass news agency account of the meeting said the Soviet
participants outlined proposals for spurring the Vienna-based talks
on conventional arms reductions, but said the U.S. government had
already rejected the ideas.
   ``We told them there is no support in Congress for beginning
conventional arms control until the meeting in Vienna finishes with
good results,'' said Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.
   He referred to the European human rights forum that has been
unable to produce a plan for improving individual freedoms in the
35 member nations, including the United States and the Soviet Union.
   But Wirth said the senators found a greater willingness on the
Soviets' part to work toward improvements in superpower relations
and further arms control measures.
   Tass said Demichev claimed a treaty eliminating half of both
nations' strategic nuclear weapons could be completed in time for
the next summit between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev
``given mutual desire.''
   However, Soviet officials have conceded privately that time is
running short before the May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow and major
differences persist on the issue of Reagan's space-based missile
defense system.
   The Soviets contend the project violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty signed by both nations. Demichev reiterated the
Kremlin line that any pact on strategic weapons cuts would have to
adhere to the ABM agreement.
   Velikhov restated the Kremlin's desire to jointly work out
measures for monitoring and verifying the disarmament process,
according to the Tass report.
   Wirth said the delegation told the Soviets they would like to
see detailed proposals on how they propose to ensure compliance in
the event an accord is signed in the future banning nuclear testing
or use of commercial space vehicles to bring weapons into the
cosmos.
   The other senators accompanying Johnston and Wirth are Kent
Conrad, D-N.D.; Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.; Bob
Graham, D-Fla.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; and Paul S. Trible, R-Va.

   A 61-year-old college professor smitten by
the Scottish burr of a bank teller machine's recorded voice met the
woman behind the accent Wednesday _ with his wife of 25 years
watching closely.
   ``I guess the first thing I should say is, `Your transaction is
processing,''' said British radio talk-show host Sally Masterson as
she met Dick Ferry and his wife, Carol, after a trans-Atlantic
flight arranged by the Decatur newspaper.
   That's the phrase that inspired Ferry, an education professor,
to write a Feb. 4 newspaper column about his ``infatuation with the
talking teller.''
   The item intrigued the Decatur Herald & Review's editors, who
tracked down Ms. Masterson and arranged for her trip after deciding
that Ferry ``should get to meet his infatuation.''
   ``This is just great,'' said Ferry, decked out in a black suit
and red tie for their meeting at a private club.
   ``She is very sweet, she is very charming,'' he said later.
``She is a person I'd very much like to have for a friend.''
   Apparently, the feeling was mutual.
   ``I think he's smashing,'' said Ms. Masterson, 29. ``He's what I
call wacky, because he's got that wacky sense of humor.''
   Mrs. Ferry, who waited arm-in-arm with her husband for Ms.
Masterson's arrival, said interest in the meeting on both sides of
the ocean ``was really overwhelming.''
   The Herald & Review reported that the story made a splash in the
British press, where it was called a ``romantic rendezvous''
triggered by a Scottish accent that is ``driving an American
teacher wild.''
   ``We take it as a joke,'' Mrs. Ferry said. ``We're having fun
with it.''
   Ms. Masterson, who is single, made the teller-machine recording
three years ago in Dundee, Scotland, for NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio.
Dundee is the design and manufacturing center for NCR's automatic
teller products worldwide.
   The recording was provided as a demonstration tape to banks that
bought the machines, said Bob Farkas, an NCR spokesman.
   In his column, Ferry described Ms. Masterson's voice as a
``seductive, sophisticated high-English way of speaking.''
   ``I think I'm in love with a woman I've never seen,'' he wrote.
``My infatuation is with the talking teller at the Money Network
station at First National Bank downtown.''
   Mrs. Ferry said she first heard the voice last weekend.
   ``I made Dick withdraw some money so I could hear the voice,''
said Mrs. Ferry, 50. ``I liked it.''
   Before Wednesday's meeting, Mrs. Ferry called the episode ``a
little unreal,'' asking, ``How would anyone feel if a young sexy
person wants to meet your husband?''
   But Ms. Masterson seemed to have won her over as well.
   ``I thought she was charming,'' Mrs. Ferry said. ``I've
thoroughly enjoyed this.''
   Ms. Masterson's schedule for Wednesday included a taste of
small-town America in Taylorville, a city of 10,000 near Decatur,
as well as dinner at a country club and a nighttime tour of Decatur.
   She was also to attend a baseball game in St. Louis and make
public appearances at several banks in central Illinois before
returning to Britain on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Democrat Dukakis Steers Course Toward New York; Bush-Dole Meet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis basked in the glow of his unexpectedly strong
Wisconsin primary victory on Wednesday as he and his Democratic
presidential rivals pointed toward New York, a cauldron of
political intrigue if there ever was one.
   From campaign rival Jesse Jackson to party chairman Paul Kirk,
Dukakis won accolades on his Wisconsin landslide. ``It puts Dukakis
in the catbird seat,'' said former party chairman John White, a
Jackson supporter.
   Dukakis shunned any such talk, likening the race to a 15-round
boxing match that will be decided by a decision, rather than a
knockout. ``My job is to go out now and do the very best I can in
New York and Pennsylvania and Ohio, and those other very important
primaries...'' he said as he campaigned in New York City.
   There were political aftershocks on the Republican side of the
race.
   Vice President George Bush, the certain nominee, met privately
with Sen. Bob Dole, once his strongest rival.
   Bush said he envisioned a role for Dole in the general election
in which the Kansan would work ``as much as he possibly has time to
give. A lot of it's here and a lot of it I hope will be around the
country.'' Dole said they talked about ``getting George elected in
November.''
   Dole also met with former television evangelist Pat Robertson,
who remains in the GOP race, and said, ``We talked about ... how
Pat might be helpful in Senate and House races and state
legislative races, build this party from bottom up.''
   Wisconsin's Democratic runnerup, Jackson, campaigned in Arizona
and pronounced himself more than satisfied with his showing thus
far. ``Forty contests have been run now,'' he said. ``I've come in
No. 1 or No. 2 in 30 of them.''
   Jackson claimed credit for changing the terms of the campaign
debate, noting that other candidates have begun to address issues
such as the fight against drugs and securing jobs for workers.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who finished a distant third in Wisconsin
and now faces a make-or-break test in New York, pronounced himself
the underdog. ``New York state has always been friendly to
underdogs,'' he said.
   Sen. Paul Simon made plans to suspend his campaign on Thursday
following his fourth place finish in Wisconsin, but was expected to
remain in the race as an inactive candidate in hopes of gaining
additional delegates in his home state of Illinois and elsewhere.
   But congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Illinois senator would not seek to participate in campaign
debates scheduled in New York over the next two weeks.
   Intentionally or not, Simon's decision to remain in the race
does Dukakis a favor in the delegate chase. Under party rules,
Simon is entitled to 47 at-large delegates from his home state of
Illinois, Jackson is entitled to 13 and Dukakis none. A Simon
withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates to Jackson's
column, and thus give him at least a temporary lead in the national
delegate competition.
   Dukakis holds a lead currently in the delegate count, 740.55 to
704.55 for Jackson. Gore has 394.8 and Simon 170.5.
   With 225 delegates at stake on April 19, the New York primary
represents one of the most important tests of the year. Dukakis
leads Jackson in the public opinion polls in the state, with Gore
trailing, and a victory in New York would firmly install him as the
front-runner in the Democratic race.
   ``The nominee will be determined in New York and Pennsylvania,''
said Rachelle Horowitz, political director of the Amnerican
Federation of Teachers and a member of the Democratic National
Committee. ``I think we have a two-person race (Dukakis and
Jackson) and we have a front-runner. The likelihood is we'll have a
nominee and not a brokered convention.''
   But Gore has signed up media consultant David Garth, a sometime
adviser to Gov. Mario Cuomo, and has decided to spend $1 million on
television advertising in New York. In an attempt to woo the large
Jewish vote in the state, Gore already has criticized Dukakis for
his views on the Middle East and has taken on Jackson on the same
topic.
   New York Mayor Ed Koch entered the fray last week, when he said
Jews ``have got to be crazy'' to vote for Jackson. Koch has spoken
warmly of Gore in the past, although he has not endorsed him.
   The Democratic Party's most talked about non-candidate, Cuomo,
also figures in the primary campaign. The governor has yet to issue
an endorsement, although he has been courted for months by all the
contenders, and there were discussions with the Dukakis campaign
several weeks ago.
   ``Mario and I are friends, we're colleagues, we're neighbors,''
he said in a television interview. ``I'd love to have his
endorsement, but I resopect that decision and we'll just see what
happens.''

<HEAD>Reagan Remark on Pardons Called Merely ``Throwaway Comment''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan was giving merely
a ``throwaway comment'' when he made a remark interpreted by some
congressmen as a sign he might pardon former aides Oliver North and
John Poindexter, the White House said Wednesday.
   ``I don't think it's safe to make any conclusions about the
president's attitude about pardons,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters as Reagan vacationed at his mountaintop
ranch.
   Fitzwater confirmed that the president, at a closed meeting with
Republican members of the House on March 22, had been urged by Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to pardon North and Poindexter, who have been
indicted on felony charges in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Hyde suggested Reagan sign pardons in the final days of his term
next January, possibly in a ceremony at the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington.
   Hyde's comments were greeted by applause from other GOP
congressmen. Reagan said, ``I like the sound of those words,''
according to one unidentified congressman quoted by The Washington
Post. Another lawmaker recalled the president as saying, ``I like
hearing what you said.''
   Some lawmakers have taken Reagan's comment as a hint that he
will pardon the two former national security aides, but Fitzwater
played down the significance of the remarks.
   He said Reagan ``told them he was not discussing pardons,
period, and then he had some throwaway line which was similar'' to
the remark quoted by the congressmen.
   ``I gave them no significance at the time. I don't give them any
significance now. Certainly you've heard the president say much
stronger things than that in terms of his feelings about North and
Poindexter,'' the spokesman said.
   He added, ``I don't believe you should make any assumptions or
conclusions on the basis of that throwaway comment.''
   Emphasizing his point, Fitzwater said, ``It's been three weeks
(since Reagan's comment). There couldn't have been too much _ you'd
have had 40 congressmen running out of the room, grabbing the
cameras like you can't believe.''
   Fitzwater said, ``I have raised the issue (of pardons) with the
president four or five times myself and I've heard it raised by
others, and every time the president says the same thing: `I'm not
discussing pardons.'''
   However, Reagan has made several comments that have fueled
speculation about pardons. Answering a question from a student last
month, he expressed the conviction that North and Poindexter ``are
going to be found innocent, because I don't think they were guilty
of any lawbreaking or any crime.''
   Reagan said, ``I still think Ollie is a hero.'' Days later, he
qualified his remark about heroism, saying he was referring to
combat honors North had won in Vietnam.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker has said the president
``is committed to seeing that the legal system operates. And I do
not anticipate that he'll address the pardon issue until it does.''
   Fitzwater declined to interpret what Baker meant about seeing
the legal system operate. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I've not
heard the president say that.''
   North and Poindexter, along with arms dealers Richard V. Secord
and Albert A. Hakim, have pleaded innocent to federal criminal
charges in the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of money to
Contra rebels fighting the leftist government of Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Shultz To Hold Talks With East German, Bulgarian Officials</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with Bulgarian talks</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is
cautiously expanding contacts with some of Moscow's staunchest
allies, will hold talks with the highest-ranking East German and
communist Bulgarian to visit Washington, officials said Wednesday.
   Hermann Axen, a member of the ruling East German politburo, will
meet Shultz on May 3 during a three-day visit to Washington. The
U.S. and East German sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the meeting was arranged after Axen was invited to give a
lecture at the Johns Hopkins University Institute for Contemporary
German Studies on May 4.
   Although Axen holds no office in the East German government, he
is the top international affairs officer of the communist Socialist
Unity Party, which controls government policy.
   Andrey K. Lukanov, Bulgarian minister for foreign economic
development, will meet Shultz during an April 25-26 visit to
Washington. Lukanov, a former deputy premier whose post was created
in a recent government reorganization, will be the first Bulgarian
cabinet minister to visit Washington since World War II.
   Since 1984, the State Department has gingerly increased its
overtures to Soviet bloc countries, not with great hopes of wooing
them from Moscow's domination but to chip away wherever possible at
hard-line human rights and economic policies.
   In visits over the past two years, Deputy Secretary of State
John C. Whitehead has told leaders in East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary that U.S. eagerness to expand
commercial ties will depend on their willingness to improve human
rights conditions.
   The U.S. source said that during Axen's talks, State Department
officials will renew pleas for better human rights performance,
notably in the realm of religion. In what the official described as
a ``mixed bag'' of actions, East Germany last year allowed two
massive religious assemblies, and the East German Jewish community
was allowed to install its first rabbi since 1967.
   In recent weeks, however, there has been a crackdown on
environmental groups affiliated with churches, the official said.
   Axen and Shultz also will discuss the two countries' effort to
settle financial claims by Americans whose property on East German
territory was taken during and after World War II. The claims total
more than $70 million.
   A U.S. effort to get other countries to do more to stop
terrorism and the flow of drugs is another likely topic, the
official said.
   An East German diplomat said ``the main intention of these talks
will be to promote the relationship between both countries and
contribute to a further buildup of the relationship.''
   The U.S. and East German officials said they doubted there would
be serious talk about a visit to the United States by East German
leader Erich Honecker, as was reported in a West German magazine.
Honecker is known to be interested in such a visit ``but it isn't
ripe for discussion,'' the U.S. official said.
   In talks with the Bulgarian official, the State Department is
expected to reassert requests for better human rights policies,
notably toward Bulgaria's sizable Turkish and Islamic minority.
   Bulgaria wants to expand trade with the United States beyond the
current $130 million level. Before he leaves the United States on
May 2, Lukanov is expected to call for improved commercial ties
during talks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington and in
meetings in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and New York.

<TEXT>
   With jury selection almost completed,
opening arguments were scheduled Thursday in the cocaine trial of
John Zaccaro Jr.
   After three days of closely questioning 30 potential jurors,
prosecutors and defense lawyers prepared to narrow the group to the
12 people who will decide whether Zaccaro is guilty of illegally
selling a regulated drug.
   The state maintains that Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury
College, sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover police
officer two years ago.
   The two sides have closely questioned the potential jurors,
trying to determine any biases stemming from the publicity given
the case and from the fact that Zaccaro, now 24, is the son of
former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Ferraro could affect his view of the case.
   Many of the potential jurors said they discounted what they had
read, because of a distrust of the press.
   ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because
they have been charged,'' said Donald Cioffi on Wednesday.
   Warren Taylor of Chittenden said he was ``not a firm believer in
what the media prints.''
   Another potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while she was a candidate in 1984,
and she thought the attacks had carried over to Zaccaro after his
arrest.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., have been present for
the three days of questioning in the cramped chambers of the
presiding judge.
   Police said they began their investigation of Zaccaro after
hearing he was dealing drugs. He is charged with selling the
cocaine to an undercover police officer.
   Defense lawyer Charles Tetzlaff has asked potential jurors if
they would be willing to find someone innocent based on a technical
defect in the state's case. The defense is expected to try to prove
that Zaccaro was entrapped by the police, and that the police
singled him out because of his famous mother.

<HEAD>Age-60 Limit for Pilots Must Be Justified</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. must justify to a jury its
requirement that test and training pilots stop flying at age 60 and
can't rely on a similar limit for commercial pilots, a federal
appeals court ruled Wednesday.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated an age
discrimination suit by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission against the Seattle-based aircraft company.
   According to the court, Boeing has 41 pilots who train other
pilots and 24 who make test flights. The company set its age-60
limit in 1980, forcing some pilots into layoffs or early
retirement, the EEOC said.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein dismissed the EEOC suit,
citing the Federal Aviation Administration's longstanding rule
requiring pilots of large commercial passenger planes to stop
flying at 60. She said the FAA rule was based on safety concerns
that applied equally to Boeing.
   The appeals court said a jury must decide on the EEOC's claim
that it would be practical to examine pilots over 60 for
disabilities, rather than automatically disqualifying them. Under
federal law, the court said, Boeing must prove that individual
testing is impractical.
   The FAA rule applies only to certain commercial pilots, and the
agency has expressly refused to apply the rule to other types of
piliots, said Chief Judge James Browning in the 3-0 decision.
   ``It may be that the age-60 rule reflects an FAA decision to
resolve any doubts about the necessity for an age qualification in
favor of the substantial number of passengers carried by (the
airlines covered by the rule),'' Browning said. He said a court
cannot assume that the same considerations would make an age-60
limit a business necessity for Boeing.
   Browning, who is 69 and recently announced his intention to step
down as chief judge but remain an active member of the court, said
Judge Rothstein did not consider EEOC evidence of new scientific
testing methods accurately predicting individual loss of function.
   He said Rothstein also disregarded evidence that Boeing employed
pilots over 60 without incident before 1980, that the Navy had
rescinded its age-60 limit for pilots, and that Boeing and airlines
have used elaborate testing procedures to allow pilots to resume
flying after being grounded for alcoholism or heart disease.
   There was also evidence that some of the work done by Boeing
pilots, such as flight training, was less stressful and dangerous
than the jobs of commercial pilots, Browning said.

   Talk about forgetful!
   Florentino Santiago lost his winning $1.25 million lottery
ticket twice, then mislaid the keys to his safety deposit box,
where he had thought his treasure was safe.
   With his initial winning payment of $47,523 finally in hand, his
family said Tuesday that some of the money would go toward
repairing damage done to the house of the 77-year-old man when
relatives ransacked it searching for the misplaced ticket.
   The retired shoe-store owner lost the ticket the first time soon
after learning Jan. 6 that he had won the prize.
   The family tore apart his home for four days and finally found
the ticket in a pillow.
   The place was pillaged again for a week when he forgot his
second hiding place until _ a moment that some interpreted as
divine intervention _ the ticket was found in Santiago's Bible.
   Santiago put it into the safety deposit box. He was on the verge
of shelling out $75 for a duplicate set of keys when he found the
originals in a safe place at the back of his closet.
   Finally Santiago's wife, Carmen, sewed a small cloth pouch for
the ticket and he bound it to his arm using adhesive tape _ enough
to make it look like a cast. He kept it there until he collected
his prize March 31.

   When officer W.E. Bass gives out speeding
tickets, he sends drivers on their way with, ``Have a nice day.''
   Some apparentlydo, and they send Bass fan mail in return.
   ``I want to treat people the way I would want to be treated in
the same circumstance,'' said Bass, who writes about 125 tickets a
month and has received about 10 fan letters this year from
motorists caught speeding on the congested streets of this Atlanta
suburb.
   ``He pulled me over and was as nice as he could be. Most
policemen today seem to be on a power trip or ego trip,'' said
Acworth resident Sharon Guillebeau, who got a ticket for traveling
47 mph in a 30 mph zone. ``He was so different from the rest that I
wanted to commend him on his good attitude.''
   Not all motorists are fans, however.
   One driver kicked out his own taillights and dented his car
while Bass was writing the ticket. ``I almost had to arrest him,''
Bass said.

   A leading Soviet expert on Afghanistan said
Wednesday that the pro-Kremlin regime in Kabul may survive the
withdrawal of the Red Army but that the lives of its leaders ``are
in the hands of the almighty.''
   In a remarkably pessimistic public assessment for a Soviet, Yuri
Gankovsky said the Kabul regime controls about 30 percent of
Afghanistan, including most administrative centers, that tribal
leaders control about 30 percent, and that the Islamic guerrillas
known as mujahedeen control just over 30 percent.
   The complicated balance of power hampers predictions of what
will happen when and if the Red Army pulls out, said Gankovsky.
   Although some guerrillas have close ties with the fundamentalist
Moslem government in Iran, Gankovsky said, ``my impression is that
an Islamic republic in Afghanistan is impossible'' because tribal
leaders are so strong.
   Many U.S. analysts believe that the pro-Kremlin government will
collapse immediately after a Soviet pullout, and that regime
officials who do not leave will be targets of revenge from the
families of the estimated 1 million Afghans who were killed or the
5 million Afghans driven into exile during the war.
   ``Individual acts of revenge may take place,'' Gankovsky said.
``But I hope that a blood bath will not take place.''
   ``It is impossible to predict the future of Najib,'' the leader
of the Kabul regime, he said. ``But we have the impression that the
regime of the People's Democratic Party may survive.'' Najib, also
known as Najibullah, uses a single name.
   As for for the fate of Najib and other leaders, Gankovsky said,
``their life is in the hands of the almighty.''
   Gankovsky, in a lecture at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies, declined to speculate how many members of
the current government might flee.
   But he said that ``some middle-sized leaders in Kabul want to
emigrate to the Soviet Union and other countries. That is their
private business.''
   Gankovsky, who retired last fall as head of the Middle and Near
East Section of the Oriental Institutes Section of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, said he was unable to comment directly on
stalled U.N. negotiations designed to end the war.
   The Soviets say that U.S. covert aid to the guerrillas should
end within 60 days after an agreement is signed. But Pakistan,
representing the interests of the United States and the guerrillas,
insists that Kremlin aid to Kabul stop at the same time.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev flew to the Soviet Central
Asian city of Tashkent on Wednesday to meet with Najib for talks
thought to center on plans for a withdrawal of Soviet troops even
if the U.N. talks collapse.
   Under the Soviet system, experts such as Gankovsky not only
write scholarly works but are asked to prepare classified reports
for the key decision-making body on foreign relations, the
International Department of the Central Committee secretariat.
   Gankovsky declined to say what advice he has the Kremlin about
Afghanistan, explaining that ``a lecture is not a confessional.''
   He denied that the Soviet Union plans to annex any part of
Afghanistan.
   And he avoided direct comment on speculation that Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan signalled an end to the so-called
``Brezhnev Doctrine,'' invoked in the past to justify military
intervention to prop up communist regimes in such nations such as
Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Instead, Gankovsky clamed that Afghanistan never had a communist
government.
   Although Najib and his colleagues represent a leftist faction
within the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, said
Gankovsky, ``there are not any communists'' among them.
   ``The biggest part of them are Afghan nationalists. They are not
communists, they are not socialists,'' he said, drawing a fine line
which was challenged vocally by some Afghan emigres in the audience.
   The chances that a pro-Kremlin regime would prevail in
Afghanistan are bolstered by the high rate of party membership, 75
percent, among military and police officials, and by the large
number of Afghans, 400,000, employed by the state, he said.

<TEXT>
   Lyn P. Meyerhoff, matriarch of one of
Baltimore's most generous philanthropic families, died Wednesday of
cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. She was 60.
   During her long fight against cancer, she launched the Jeane
Kirkpatrick Institute at Tel Aviv University, hoping to advance
American-style democracy by bringing U.S. government officials to
Israel to share their ideas.
   In 1983, President Reagan chose her as one of the public members
of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly.
   In 1986 she helped establish the Harvey M. and Lyn P. Meyerhoff
Digestive Disease-Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at the Johns
Hopkins Hospital.
   Her husband, Harvey M. Meyerhoff, is a real estate developer and
investor.
   Mrs. Meyerhoff, whose parents were Democrats, became active in
national Republican Party politics during Richard Nixon's campaign
of 1960. She remained a steadfast supporter of Nixon until his
resignation in 1974.
   Once an admirer of former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, she was
co-chair of Citizens for Nixon-Agnew in Maryland and later said he
was her biggest disappointment in politics. She was called to
testify before a 1973 Anne Arundel County grand jury investigating
contributions to Agnew, a former governor of Maryland.
   Mrs. Meyerhoff was born Lenore P. Pancoe, in Winnetka, Ill., on
Aug. 5, 1927. She met her husband while both were students at the
University of Wisconsin.
   Besides her mother and husband, survivors include three
daughters, a son, two brothers, a sister and eight grandchildren.

   A 23-month-old boy escaped serious
injury when he fell through a hole in the floor of a car, which
then drove on without him, police said.
   The child apparently reached down to get a potato chip and
slipped through a hole in the back seat floor of the 1977
Chevrolet, police said after the incident Tuesday.
   The car's driver and the boy's 16-year-old mother, a passenger
in the car, apparently didn't realize the child was missing until
the car reached a stoplight, said Police Officer Louis Redpath.
   The driver, Debra Alwerdt, 26, of Springfield, was ticketed for
having an unsafe vehicle, police said.
   The hole, which had been covered by a mat, ``is big enough for a
small adult to go through,'' he said. ``We're just lucky the wheels
didn't get him.''
   Authorities believe the car may have been stopped in traffic
when the child fell, police spokesman Neil Williamson said
Wednesday.

   A convicted rustler and unrepentant
cowboy who has had frequent run-ins with the government was
recommended Wednesday for a gaming license at a tiny rural casino.
   Jimmy Williams, 57, whose faded jeans are held up by rope
suspenders, won an endorsement from the state Gaming Control Board
for a license to run two slot machines and a blackjack game at the
Golden Club in the isolated central Nevada town of Austin.
   Williams, who inherited a one-sixth interest in the club from
his mother, faces a final review before the board's parent Gaming
Commission on April 21.
   Control Board Chairman Mike Rumbolz said he had been concerned
because Williams' various run-ins with authorities hadn't been
fully disclosed. However, he blamed that on Williams' lawyer.
   Williams, wearing shiny black street shoes, a cowboy hat,
western shirt and jeans, said he forgot many of the incidents.
Sometimes, he said, he pleaded guilty just so he could get back to
the hills.
   ``There used to be no law out there,'' Williams said, explaining
conflicts with brand inspectors, the Bureau of Land Management and
other regulatory agencies.
   He said he spent 10 months in prison in 1962 for rustling. He
said he had hauled another rancher's sheep out of an area where
they were interfering with a camp he was running, and simply
released them elsewhere.
   In another case, Williams said he traded some pigs for a vehicle
jack, battery and other equipment that turned out to be stolen BLM
property.
   Williams also salvaged some discarded well pipe on BLM land,
planning to build corrals, and wound up with a grand larceny charge
which also was dismissed.

   Michael Dukakis' impressive Wisconsin victory
stirred cautious optimism among Democrats on Wednesday that the
race for their party's presidential nomination would end without a
bloodbath at the national convention in July.
   The Massachusetts governor had moved on to the next major
battleground, New York, even as Wisconsin voters were giving him a
20-point win over his chief rival, Jesse Jackson. Dukakis was
banking on another victory in the April 19 New York primary to
widen his lead in the race.
   ``Dukakis has rallied from his defeat in the Michigan caucuses
to win three straight states (Connecticut, Colorado and
Wisconsin),'' said Richard Wiener, the Michigan Democratic Party
chairman. ``It certainly is a good sign for his campaign, he has
momentum as he goes into New York.''
   Jackson's landslide victory in Michigan, following a strong
showing in Illinois, had given the civil rights activist a claim to
front-runner status in the race.
   ``The nominee will be determined in New York and Pennsylvania,''
said Rachelle Horowitz, political director of the American
Federation of Teachers and a member of the Democratic National
Committee. ``I think we have a two-person race and we have a
front-runner. The likelihood is we'll have a nominee and not a
brokered convention.''
   Former national party chairman John C. White, who has been
advising Jackson, said the Wisconsin result ``gives Dukakis a good
bump for New York. It got his chin above water.''
   A long list of Democrats have claimed momentum in the
presidential nomination race, none of them yet able to sustain it.
People like Gary Hart, Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon had moments
in the sun. Even Albert Gore Jr. and Bruce Babbitt. And this wasn't
the first time Dukakis could say he was on a roll.
   The Wisconsin vote ``gives a little boost to Dukakis,'' said
Joseph Crangle, Erie County, N.Y. Democratic chairman, and one of
the party's super delegates. ``But you've got to put a qualifying
clause there that you've got to have a pattern, you've got to go
two or three states in a row in order to say that you're a
front-runner.''
   Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. predicted the Democrats would
choose their nominee on the first ballot of the Atlanta convention
and he vowed to oppose any effort to organize a stop-Jackson
movement.
   ``There's not going to be any organized cabal of party leaders
trying to hobble one candidate as opposed to another,'' said Kirk.
   A total of 2,082 delegates is needed for a convention majority.
To reach that number, either Dukakis or Jackson would need to win
more than 1,300 of the 1,600-plus committed delegates yet to be
chosen or draw strong support from the super delegates, the party
and elected officials whose 645 votes could be decisive.
   ``The super delegates are going to stay frozen for a while,''
predicted White.
   Wiener said the super delegates were ``looking for a candidate
who can ratle off a big string of wins.'' He said most of those
delegates accept the view that ``if there is a clear leader after
California and New Jersey (the last two big states to hold
primaries), that super delegates ought to play a leading role in
propelling that person over the top. At three in a row, Gov.
Dukakis has gotten a very good start on that.''
   An endorsement from New York Gov. Mario Cuomo would brighten
Dukakis' prospects in the state, but there was no sign the governor
was ready to tilt to his Massachusetts colleague.
   ``I'd like to have it,'' Dukakis said. ``He knows that. But it's
his decision to make, and I'll respect whatever decision he makes.
It's up to him.
   ``We're good friends and colleagues. We talk often. ... But he's
under no legal or moral obligation to endorse anybody.''
   Crangle said he had seen no indication that Cuomo was ready to
endorse.
   The Erie official and others cited the continued presence of
Gore in the race as another potential hazard for Dukakis.
   Crangle pointed out that in 1976, another Southerner, Jimmy
Carter, surprised people by getting a lot of support in the
northern and western portions of New York state. ``The question
mark, I think, is does Gore take anything away from Dukakis,'' said
Crangle.
   ``I don't know what the hell Gore is in there for,'' said
Kenneth Melley, political director of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teachers union. Still, he added,
in light of Wisconsin, ``I think a lot of Democrats are breathing
sighs of relief.''

<HEAD>Chinese Deny Missile Sales to Iran</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government minister, speaking in a rare news
conference Wednesday, rejected U.S. claims that China had provided
missiles to Iran and said Beijing has behaved responsibly in
selling weapons abroad.
   Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian said his government had taken
measures to keep missiles from being sold to Iran for use in its
7{-year-old war with Iraq.
   Before selling intermediate-range conventional missiles to Saudi
Arabia, China made the Saudis promise to forgo transfer or first
use of them, Wu said. The sale was regarded as unusual because
China and anti-communist Saudi Arabia do not have diplomatic
relations.
   ``Our attitude on arms sales is a serious one; it's a
responsible one as well,'' Wu said heatedly when a reporter asked
if China was willing to sell weapons to any buyer. ``Some press
tend to pick on China, and whenever China sells weapons China
becomes the newsmaker.
   ``How about the weapons flying around the (Persian) Gulf region
... the Stinger and Exocet?'' he said, referring to U.S.- and
French-made missiles.
   Wu defended Chinese weapons sales at a wide-ranging 90-minute
news conference in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. He was
accompanied by his deputy, Qian Qichen.
   The Reagan administration last year suspended its liberalization
of high-tech equipment sales to China to punish Beijing for the
alleged Silkworm missile sales to Iran. However, it lifted the
freeze during a visit by Wu last month.
   China says it does not sell weapons to Iran or Iraq.
   ``China has long adopted strict measures to prevent Chinese
missiles from flowing into Iran through the international market,''
Wu said. He did not give details of the measures.
   U.S. officials say China has shipped Silkworms to Iran via North
Korea, not for ideological reasons but because the trade is
lucrative.
   Iran, which has used Silkworms in attacks on Kuwaiti
installations, claims it captured some of the missiles from Iraq
and says it also makes its own.
   Western observers estimate China sells about $2 billion in
weapons each year, making it one of the world's top five arms
exporters.
   Wu said China is not willing to sell to any buyer. In the case
of the missile sale to Saudi Arabia, he said, increasing the Arab
kingdom's defense capability ``is conducive to the stability of the
situation in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.''
   On another issue Wednesday, Wu said his trip last month to the
United States had improved U.S.-Chinese relations. They soured last
year over China's arms sales and its use of military force to put
down independence protests in Tibet.
   The officials also said China seeks to avoid war with Vietnam
over the disputed Nansha Islands in the South China Sea, where the
two countries' ships clashed last month.
   Qian accused Vietnam of sending ships to the area ``to provoke
China.''
   He also dismissed recent overtures from President Roh Tae-woo of
South Korea, saying China will never establish diplomatic relations
with that country. Beijing is a close ally of communist North Korea.

<HEAD>Summit Not Dependant on Pullout From Afghanistan, White House Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will go ahead with
a summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev even if Red
Army troops have not started pulling out of Afghanistan, the White
House said Wednesday.
   ``That might be an even better reason to go _ to press the case
for them to depart and depart as soon as possible,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``So clearly, that would
not be a reason for not going.
   ``The summit is on track and there are a number of issues the
president will push while he is in the Soviet Union. ... And if we
don't have action to pull the troops out of (Afghanistan) by the
time we go, I think that would ... probably move to the very top of
the president's agenda,'' Fitzwater said.
   Reagan is to visit Moscow from May 29 to June 2 for his fourth
summit with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev said Feb. 8 that if a withdrawal agreement being
negotiated in Geneva was signed by March 15, Soviet soldiers would
start pulling out May 15.
   He also said the withdrawal could be completed within nine
months, with most of the Soviet soldiers removed within three
months.
   While the deadline has passed, Soviet officials have asserted
the troop pullout will begin this year anyway, with or without a
Geneva agreement.
   Fitzwater said it was difficult to say whether Soviet troops
would be withdrawn by the time Reagan visits Moscow.
   ``Every indication we have is that the Soviets are planning on
pulling their troops out of Afghanistan,'' he said. ``The timetable
is now not precise because of their looking into the negotiations,
but it does appear that that track is continuing.''

<HEAD>Tulsa Voters Oust Mayor, Milwaukee Elects First New Mayor In 28
Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Primary Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in Tulsa, Okla., have unseated their incumbent mayor,
Milwaukee voters have elected their first new mayor in 28 years and
the mayor of Columbia, Mo., survived a recall election provoked by
racial tension.
   Elsewhere, a campaign supported by presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson succeeded in defeating a Cleveland charter amendment that
was viewed as an attack on the city's highest elected black.
   Tulsa Mayor-elect Rodger Randle said Wednesday he will spend the
first 100 days in office balancing next year's city budget,
preparing a charter change proposal and making a blueprint for
economic development for his once oil-rich city. The budget is
expected to fall $6 million short next year.
   Randle said he also intends to propose a change in the city's
charter, which has been challenged by the NAACP as being unfair to
blacks. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People filed suit claiming the city's commission form of government
dilutes black voting strength.
   Randle, 44, soundly defeated Republican Dick Crawford, 54, in
Tuesday's election, claiming 55.3 percent or 45,517 votes to
Crawford's 34.2 percent or 28,142 votes.
   Crawford, elected in 1986, said he looks forward to spending
more time with his family, getting back into banking and refusing
to talk to reporters who once called at all hours.
   In Milwaukee, state Sen. John Norquist swept to victory over
former acting Gov. Martin Schreiber in the race to succeed Mayor
Henry Maier, who is retiring at age 70 after holding the office
since 1960.
   Complete, unofficial returns from the non-partisan election had
Norquist with 112,902 votes, or 54 percent, and Schreiber with
93,738 votes, or 45 percent.
   Norquist, 38, said the margin reflected ``a mandate for
change,'' a signal that people ``want the racial and economic
divisions to be bridged.''
   Columbia Mayor Rodney Smith, 59, a self-employed tree surgeon
elected as a write-in candidate in 1986, easily survived a recall
election prompted by remarks he made last October at a meeting with
blacks angry over the forced resignation of the black police chief.
   The white mayor told a predominantly black crowd that if they
didn't like Columbia they ought to leave.
   Final returns showed 9,041 voters, or 78 percent, wanted Smith
to remain in office while 2,493 voters, or 22 percent, favored
ouster.
   ``I had hopes it would be this way because I don't feel like
I've done anything that should've upset the community. I'm sorry
that it happened,'' Smith said Tuesday night.
   Supporters of a defeated Cleveland referendum, on whether the
city charter should be amended to limit the city council president
to two one-year terms, said they won't give up.
   Voters soundly defeated the charter amendment by a vote of
46,854 to 25,458 in a special election Tuesday. The measure was
aimed at ousting City Council President George Forbes, who has
headed the 21-member Council for the last 15 years.
   ``We'll come up with something again. Or we'll keep protesting
until some kind of change comes through,'' said Ann Chudner, a
leader of the Coalition for Ordinance Reforming Council's
Efficiency, which charged that Forbes abused his power.
   Jesse Jackson's picture was used on literature against the
amendment and a radio advertisement featured Jackson urging voters
to defeat it.
   Unofficial returns showed 46,854 votes against the measure, or
65 percent, to 25,458 in favor, or 35 percent.
   Kenosha, Wis., a city rocked by Chrysler Corp.'s announced
closing of an auto plant, also turned back an incumbent. With 33 of
34 precincts reporting, unofficial returns showed Alderman Pat
Moran with 12,329 votes to 10,130 for Mayor Eugene Dorff.

   A judge Wednesday granted surrogate mother
Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould unsupervised visits once a week with the
child she bore under a $10,000 contract and urged a truce in the
Baby M legal battle.
   Both sides said they won't appeal the ruling by Superior Court
Judge Birger M. Sween, bringing to a close a court fight that
sparked worldwide debate on parental rights and reproductive
technology.
   Sween held that 2-year-old Melissa Stern, originally dubbed Baby
M in court papers, will not suffer emotionally by seeing Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould for one six-hour visit a week. He said the schedule
will be expanded over the next year to include overnight stays,
some holidays and two weeks in the summer of 1989.
   ``She and her mother have the right to develop their own special
relationship,'' Sween said in a decision filed in Hackensack and
made public by attorneys here.
   The child's father, William Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth, have
custody of Melissa. They wanted Sween to delay for at least six
years visits between Melissa and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who had been
seeing the child for two hours once a week under supervision.
   Sween also moved to protect Melissa's privacy, barring both
sides from discussing her publicly, such as in the promotion of
books or movies, without court approval.
   But Sween's ruling allows both sides to talk about their
experiences, clearing the way for a book Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has
planned.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said in a statement released by her
attorneys that her relationship with Melissa ``will be strengthened
and advanced'' by the visitation and she looks forward to a
``meaningful and substantial relationship.''
   ``I hope that beginning today, there will be a renewed spirit of
cooperation between all of Melissa's parents; that this cooperation
will be fueled by our common interest in ensuring her happiness and
welfare,'' said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould.
   The Sterns were generally unhappy with the ruling, but will not
appeal, said one of their attorneys, Frank Donahue.
   ``It wasn't their satisfaction with the decision that made them
decide against appealing. They wanted to put an end to the
litigation and the publicity and protect Melissa,'' Donahue said.
   Sween rejected the Sterns contention during last week's
visitation hearing that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would emotionally harm
the child and exploit her in the media.
   ``Melissa is a resilient child who is no less capable than
thousands of children of broken marriages who successfully adjust
to complex family realtionships when their parents remarry,'' Sween
said.
   The judge urged both sides to set aside the bad feelings, for
Melissa's sake.
   ``Family dreams have been shattered, insults and false
accusations have been exchanged, and lies and deceptions made in
the heat of litigation,'' he said. ``However, family tragedies in
our society are not uncommon and parents often are called upon to
make sacrifices.''
   The emotional tug-of-war began after Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, then
married to Richard Whitehead, agreed to be artificially inseminated
with Stern's sperm. Mrs. Whitehead, who is pregnant, has since
divorced Whitehead and married accountant Dean Gould.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould gave birth to the child March 31, 1986, but
decided to refuse the $10,000 surrogate fee and keep the baby. That
decision led to a landmark New Jersey Supreme Court ruling, which
outlawed surrogacy-for-pay, restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
parental rights, upheld custody for the Sterns and ordered the
lower court hearing on visitation rights.
   In a related development, a Florida Senate committee Wednesday
approved a bill that would make it a felony to accept a fee to bear
a child for another couple.

   A theory that upsets traditional notions
about 11-year sunspot cycles has been bolstered by the earliest,
most detailed observation ever made of solar jet streams that will
produce sunspots by 1997, scientists say.
   Astronomer Roger Ulrich and his colleagues at the University of
California, Los Angeles, were able to see the jet streams ``at
higher latitudes (on the sun) and earlier than we were ever able to
before,'' said astrophysicist Herschel Snodgrass of Lewis and Clark
College in Portland, Ore.
   ``We're seeing the very earliest stage of the next sunspot
cycle, not the one that is producing sunspots now, but that one
that will produce them when this cycle is over,'' said Ulrich, who
presented his findings Wednesday during a solar physics meeting in
Tucson, Ariz.
   Understanding the sunspot cycle is important because the spots
and related explosions called solar flares disrupt radar, radio and
other communications on Earth and, in extreme cases, are believed
to contribute to ice ages and major droughts, Snodgrass said
Tuesday by telephone from Portland.
   Ulrich said solar flares make Earth's outer atmosphere expand,
so learning more about sunspots is important in deciding when to
launch satellites, since atmospheric expansion produces
orbit-altering drag on spacecraft.
   Snodgrass and Air Force astrophysicist Richard Altrock said
Ulrich's observation of the jet streams, which are east-west
currents of gas parallel to the sun's equator, supports a theory
they developed independently with California Institute of
Technology astronomer Peter Wilson.
   Last year, they proposed that the 11-year sunspot cycle _ during
which the number of sunspots reaches a maximum, then a minimum and
then another maximum _ is merely part of a previously unknown 18-to
22-year cycle that produces visible sunspots only during its last
11 years.
   The theory says that during the earliest stages of this longer
cycle, jet stream-like gas currents appear near the sun's poles
like smoke rings, which then grow and roll down the sun toward the
equator, Altrock said by telephone from Sunspot, N.M.
   Only when the jet streams reach a solar latitude of 30 or 35
degrees do they produce sunspots, Ulrich said.
   He said he detected the jet streams at a latitude of 70 degrees
on the sun.
   ``These jet streams eventually will migrate into the region
where sunspots form,'' probably about 1997, Ulrich said.
   The last sunspot cycle reached its minimum in September 1986, so
the next maximum is expected about 1991 and the next minimum in
1997 or 1998, Snodgrass said.
   The current batch of sunspots ``is rising much faster than any
other we've seen,'' he added. ``There is evidence to suggest it's
going to be unusually strong and perhaps the maximum will be
reached earlier than usual, in 1989 or 1990,'' with the minimum
following in 1995 or 1996.
   Sunspots are relatively cool spots, 1,200 to 60,000 miles
across, that each appear for three to seven weeks where the solar
magnetic field is about 1,000 times stronger than in other
locations. Up to 30 appear at one time.
   Ulrich and his colleagues were able to see the solar jet streams
closer to the sun's poles in more detail than ever before by
measuring the speed of gases on the sun's surface 20 times daily
using the 150-foot-tall solar observatory and 75-foot-deep
spectrograph on Mount Wilson, in the San Gabriel Mountains
northeast of Los Angeles.
   Sunlight passes through a lens near the top of the observatory
tower. The lens focuses an image of the sun on a hole that lets the
light enter the spectrograph.
   The spectrograph breaks the sunlight into a rainbow of component
colors. That allows the scientists to measure the speed of solar
gases and detect jet streams.
   ``It's the same way a radar gun on the highway measures the
velocity of a car,'' Ulrich said.
   The jet streams may help scientists understand why the number of
sunspots varies, Ulrich said.

<HEAD>Arms Treaty Will Save Pentagon $1.7 Billion, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Destruction of U.S. medium-range missiles
under the new U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms reduction treaty will save
the Pentagon about $1.7 billion through the fall of 1995, the
General Accounting Office reported Wednesday.
   The savings will come because the Pentagon will no longer need
to maintain its Pershing and ground-launched cruise missile force
in Western Europe, the GAO said. Money will also be saved on
associated costs for military personnel, procurement, and
construction of housing for military family members, it said.
   ``Army officials told us that some of the equipment procured
under the Pershing II program would not be subject to treaty
limitation and would therefore be available for use in other Army
units,'' the GA0 said.
   It said this includes radios, trucks, generators, tool kits and
other support equipment whose total value is unclear.
   The Air Force, it said, has identified more than $550 million in
equipment that will be reused and about $50 million in funding that
will be recovered because of project cancellations.
   For example, the GAO quoted Air Force officials as saying that
76 launch control centers, valued at about $6 million each for a
total $456 million, will be reused.
   And it said about $114 million worth of missile components
produced under existing Air Force contracts will be made available
to the Navy for its sea-launched cruise missile program.
   The Air Force also expects to recover about $40 million to $58
million in previously approved military construction funds,
according to the GAO.
   The treaty would require the United States to destroy a total of
867 medium-range missiles while the Soviet Union would be required
to eliminate some 1,800 weapons.
   The U.S. missiles to be destroyed over a 36-month period
beginning after the pact is ratified by the Senate, include 178
Pershing IAs, 247 Pershing IIs, and 442 ground-launched cruise
missiles, together with their launchers and certain support and
training equipment.
   The costs of actually destroying the weapons are classified and
will be provided separately to members of Congress, the agency said.
   The Pentagon spent a total $6.5 billion for the Pershing II and
ground-launched cruise missile systems, the GAO said, including
$2.6 billion for the Pershings and $3.45 billion for the cruise
missiles.
   Those totals include the costs of research and development,
procurement, military construction and missile modifications.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 17-2 last month to
recommend the full Senate approve the treaty.
   Barring unexpected developments, Senate debate on the treaty is
expected to begin late this month or in early May.
   The GAO report was requested by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., an
opponent of the treaty.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong, gusty wind shook the Chicago area Wednesday,
thunderstorms rumbled from the Great Lakes into parts of the South
and locally heavy rain fell on the parched Northwest.
   A strong storm system over the Indiana-Ohio border pulled
northwesterly wind through downtown Chicago at 35 to 48 mph,
gusting above 60 mph at times and reaching a peak gust of 75 mph.
   The wind pushed up waves up to 10 feet high on the Lake Michigan
shores of Illinois and Indiana.
   The wind also blew across much of Illinois and western Indiana,
with gusts to 61 mph at Lafayette, Ind.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered from the Great
Lakes through the Ohio Valley into the southern Atlantic states and
the Florida Panhandle. Showers were heavy at times across parts of
Lower Michigan, and Lansing had 1.3 inches of rain by midafternoon.
   Thunderstorms produced high wind that downed power lines around
West Campbellsville, Ky. Thunderstorms with strong, gusty wind were
reported in parts of the Carolinas during the afternoon.
   Showers were scattered across the Pacific Northwest into
northwestern Montana. Diablo Dam in the upper Skagit Valley in
northwestern Washington state reported 3.95 inches of rain in 24
hours. Quillayute, Wash., recorded 2.36 inches of rain in 24 hours.
   Record highs Wednesday were 67 at Binghamton, N.Y., and 81 at
Youngstown, Ohio.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Pellston and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.; Bloomington and
South Bend, Ind.; and Hyannis, Mass., to 101 at Palm Springs and
Thermal, Calif. The early-morning low for the day was 9 degrees at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   For Thursday, widespread showers were forecast from the eastern
Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley through the central Appalachians
and mid-Atlantic states. Showers and a few thunderstorms were
forecast across Virginia and North Carolina. Scattered showers were
forecast from the Pacific Northwest through the northern Rockies,
with snow showers possible east of the Continental Divide across
Montana.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted from northern Washington into
northwestern Montana, and across the northern Great Lakes; in the
50s from the northern Pacific Coast into the northern Rockies, and
from the upper Mississippi Valley through the Ohio Valley and
central Appalachians into the mid-Atlantic region and New England;
in the 80s from the southern California valleys to the southern and
central high Plains into the southern Plains and Texas; around 90
across the desert Southwest; and in the 60s or 70s across most of
the rest of the nation.

   A month-long U.S.-Honduran operation
culiminating in a predawn police raid in Honduras put an alleged
international cocaine trafficker in Illinois federal prison
Wednesday for questioning in the slaying of a U.S. drug agent,
officials said.
   A ``stunned'' Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros was lodged at the
maximum-security federal prison in Marion, Ill., after Honduran
officials on Tuesday hustled him onto a plane to the Dominican
Republic without a passport, U.S. law enforcement sources said.
   Dominican Republic officials put Matta on a New York-bound
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals,
the sources said.
   Angry Honduran legislators labeled Matta's capture a
``kidnapping,'' and the Honduran Foreign Ministry began an
investigation of the procedures used. The Honduran constitution
prohibits extradition of Honduran citizens to the United States.
   ``Matta was kidnapped in open violation of our laws,'' Carlos
Montoya, speaker of Honduras' single-house legislature, told
reporters Wednesday. ``It does not only violate our constitutional
principles and individual guarantees, but also all the state's
police laws.''
   Edmond Brogan, a Liberal legislator and editor of the
influential newspaper El Tiempo, called the action ``an abominable
conduct by President Jose Azcona Hoyo's administration and the
armed forces.''
   Howard Safir, the chief of operations for the U.S. Marshals
Service who is a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent, has
been in and out of Honduras for the past month spearheading the
effort to get Matta into U.S. custody, said the source, speaking
only on condition of anonymity.
   According to U.S. law enforcement sources, Matta was taken into
custody in a pre-dawn helicopter raid Tuesday by Honduran
authorities at his home in Tegucigalpa on a warrant signed by a
city judge.
   Matta's wife, Nancy Vasquez, said police and the judge had
placed a bag of cocaine on the table in their house and said they
had found it there. She said there had been no drugs at the
residence.
   Carlos Lorenzana, Matta's lawyer, said in a telephone interview
that about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at
his client's home at 5:45 a.m.
   ``Matta was stunned'' by the raid, one U.S. law enforcement
source said. ``He couldn't believe it.''
   Matta had been living openly in Honduras after escaping in 1986
from a Colombian prison.
   In addition to drug charges, the DEA wants to question Matta
about the 1985 murder in Mexico of DEA agent Enrique Camarena
Salazar. According to one U.S. law enforcement source, DEA agents
already have interviewed Matta briefly since his arrival in the
United States.
   Camarena was kidnapped, tortured and killed in Guadalajara,
Mexico, in a slaying allegedly ordered by drug traffickers. John C.
Lawn, the head of the DEA, said Matta was one of the four prime
suspects in the case.
   Matta had been held in Colombia on charges of involvement with
the Medellin cartel, the world's largest cocaine-trafficking
organization.
   The marshals service said Matta was believed to have become a
leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of
illegal drugs from Mexico.
   U.S. authorities link Matta's return to Honduras to an increase
in transshipment of Colombian cocaine through the Central American
country.
   Honduran authorities put Matta on a plane headed for the
Dominican Republic without a passport, the U.S. law enforcement
sources said.
   As a Honduran citizen, Matta could not be extradited to the
United States because the Honduran constitution forbids it.
   After being informed Matta was wanted in the United States, the
Dominican Republic put him on a New York-bound jetliner and Matta
was arrested immediately on board the plane by U.S. marshals,
authorities said.
   He subsequently was placed in a cell at Marion, which the
federal prison system uses to house its most dangerous criminals.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
United States viewed the arrest ``as a major successful step in our
effort to stem the flow of illegal narcotics trafficking. We think
that both the Honduran and Dominican Republic governments have
demonstrated their strong commitment to combatting narcotics
trafficking through their actions.''
   The Marshals Service said the expulsion from the Dominican
Republic was based on a U.S. warrant for Matta after he escaped
from Eglin Federal Prison Camp in Florida in 1971. He was serving a
five-year sentence for illegally entering the United States and
using a fraudulent visa.
   Warrants charged Matta with escape from federal custody,
conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, possession with intent to distribute
cocaine, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other
crimes.
   Allegations have been made of involvement in drug shipments by
top Honduran military officials.
   The government denied the reports in February. Azcona said
critics were trying ``to discredit the armed forces and my
government, which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug
traffickers.''
   Matta told The Associated Press in February he makes his living
in cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, spice and coffee
trade. His wealth has been estimated at up to $2 billion, but he
put it at about $5 million.
   He said the charges against him were ``a lie, a story,'' and
claimed U.S. agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap
him.
   Matta said then he never again would leave Honduras. ``If I
appear in the United States, it is a kidnapping by American agents.
If I am killed, it is the DEA,'' he said at the time.

<TEXT>
   The black co-discoverer of the North Pole
received what one supporter called ``long overdue recognition'' as
his remains were reinterred with full military honors Wednesday at
Arlington National Cemetery.
   Matthew Alexander Henson was the first to reach the North Pole
and planted the American flag there exactly 79 years earlier during
a trek with Adm. Robert E. Peary and four Eskimos.
   Peary was buried at Arlington in 1920 and a huge monument to him
was erected by his grave. Henson, however, ended up at his death in
1955 in a shared grave at Woodlawn Cemetery in New York because his
wife could not afford a separate gravesite.
   ``He was denied proper recognition because of the racial
attitudes of his time,'' said Dr. S. Allen Counter, a Harvard
professor who successfully petitioned President Reagan to allow
Henson's reinterment at Arlington.
   Counter, who previously had brought together Henson's and
Peary's part-Eskimo offspring, told about 100 relatives and
admirers at the windswept hilltop burial site that the reinterment
of Henson and his wife, Lucy Ross Henson, was ``long overdue
recognition for our hero ... (that would) right a tragic wrong.''
   ``Welcome home, Matthew Henson,'' he said. ``Welcome home to a
new day in America. ... May your presence here inspire generations
of explorers.''
   Henson's remains now rest alongside Peary's, with the remains of
their wives on either side.
   Descendants of Matthew and Lucy Henson were joined at the
ceremony by Henson's part-Eskimo descendants fathered when he was
in the Arctic.
   ``Now, finally, Matthew Henson and Robert Peary can talk about
old days out there,'' a grandson, Qitdlaq Henson of Qaanaaq,
Greenland, said through a translator at a news conference following
the ceremony.
   A monument installed next to the gravesite includes a quote from
Henson, who was 88 when he died: ``The lure of the Arctic is
tugging at my heart. To me the trail is calling! The old trail _
The trail that is always new.''
   Although repeated references were made to Peary's concern that
Henson's achievements be recognized, none of Peary's relatives
attended the ceremony, Counter said.
   ``I'm sorry they're not here,'' Counter said at the news
conference, adding that he had invited both Peary's son and
grandson and had offered to help with travel arrangements. He said
that if he had known none of Peary's American descendants were
going to attend, he would have invited his part-Eskimo offspring.
   Counter said the costs of the reinterments _ including exhuming
the Hensons from the New York cemetery, the two bronze caskets, the
monument, bringing Henson's offspring from Greenland and the rest
of the arrangements _ ran into the thousands, but he would not be
more specific or say exactly who paid for what. An aide, Ted Doyle,
said Counter took care of most of the bills.
   Gen. Julius Beckton of the White House military office conveyed
greetings from Reagan, who approved the reinterment last October.
   ``All Americans join us today in saluting Matthew Alexander
Henson as he receives the recognition he so long deserved,''
Beckton said.
   Among those speaking at the ceremony were John H. Johnson, the
chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson Publishing Co.,
which publishes Ebony and Jet magazines, and Col. Guion S. Bluford,
the first black astronaut.
   ``Matthew Henson taught us all a great deal,'' Johnson said.
``He taught us to be independent. He taught us to achieve. ... He
never got the recognition he deserved, but he never complained.''
   Bluford described the ceremony as ``a proud and historic moment
in America's history. ... We not only pay homage to him, but we
remind future generations of his accomplishment and
achievements.... He was the point man in one of man's greatest
achievements.''

   Partying vandals made a shambles of
a suburban house left in the care of the owners' 20-year-old
mentally retarded son, who fled and apparently was afraid to come
home.
   The young man's mother, Corinne McConaghey, ``tells us he's
capable of functioning in society, so everybody's best guess is
just that he's frightened,'' Police Sgt. Doug Larsson said
Wednesday.
   The McConagheys returned home Monday after a week in Florida,
but did not file a missing persons report on their son, Michael,
until Tuesday.
   Telephone calls to the McConaghey home were not answered
Wednesday.
   ``I think my Michael is still around, but he's just deathly
afraid to come home. We want him to come home, and we're not
angry,'' Mrs. McConaghey said in an interview Tuesday with The
Daily Herald of Arlington Heights.
   Michael, who had been left in charge of the house in the past,
invited a few friends over for a party, Larsson said.
   Over the next few days, word of the open-house bash spread and
groups of 10 to 15 party-goers, some driving 20 miles from Chicago,
dropped by at all hours.
   ``We originally thought this was a marathon kind of party, where
people heard about this on a party-line (call) or the radio ... and
maybe 100 or so people descended on the house for a whole
weekend,'' said Larsson.
   ``But as we piece this together, it's something that got out of
hand. Kids apparently learned about it by word-of-mouth and just
kept showing up in clusters and leaving.''
   ``That is a very expensive neighborhood,'' he added. ``Somebody
would have called us earlier if there had been big, loud parties
going all the time.''
   When police were finally called by a neighbor Sunday, officers
found Michael home alone and the house in ruins.
   Police Cmdr. Richard Hammer said Michael appeared disoriented
said about 100 people had visited over a two-day period. He said he
passed out at one point and woke up to find the mess.
   Police say Michael apparently fled shortly after they
interviewed him.
   Virtually every room in the two-story house was wrecked, all the
upstairs doors were kicked in and there was a large hole in one
wall, police said.
   Total damage and theft costs _ including telephones, video
recorders and some computer equipment _ could exceed $25,000.
   The family's 1986 Buick was stolen but recovered later from a
nearby forest preserve, its radio missing.
   At least one person was arrested with items taken from the
McConaghey home, and Larsson said Wednesday police expect to make
additional arrests.
   Mrs. McConaghey said she hopes the people who wrecked her house
will understand someday what they did.
   ``I hope this is something they will never forget ... when they
are older and in their own houses.''

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case signaled
Wednesday he was ready to discuss a ``realistic trial date'' to
achieve an ``expeditious disposition'' of the criminal charges
against the four defendants.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell rejected as too cumbersome
a proposal by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh for elaborate
procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of 150,000 pages
of classified documents that may become evidence in the case.
   Walsh's proposal ``appears to be far too complex, lacks definite
time restrictions and creates undue obstacles to the fair and
expeditous disposition of this case,'' Gesell said in a brief
opinion.
   Under the prosecution plan, defense lawyers for former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver North and arms
dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim would be required to
obtain security clearances before they could examine the documents
at a ``special compartmented information facility.''
   The four defendants are accused of conspiring to defraud the
government by diverting some of the profits from the U.S.-Iran arms
sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Walsh's propposal laid out intricate steps under the Classified
Information Procedures Act for court review of sensitive documents
that might be introduced by either side as evidence when the case
goes to trial.
   Walsh said defense lawyers cannot begin examining the documents
until adequate procedures are imposed by the court. He said
pre-trial discovery could take three months.
   But Gesell said ``it will be necessary to frame a more limited
protective order fashioned to the nature of this case, which in
essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified
materials in classified channels from a highly classified site.''
   The judge said he wants to determine ``to what extent'' the
documents ``will be made available available immediately'' for
inspection by the defense.
   At a hearing scheduled for next Tuesday, ``the court intends to
determine the timing of discovery disclosures in relation to a
realistic trial date,'' Gesell said.
   Gesell said he wants to set an April deadline for interagency
review of the classified materials that have been collected during
Walsh's 15-month investigation and set a time for the defense to
notify the court if it intends to use any secret documents as
evidence.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the defense is
required to tell the court which material it will use. The statute
contains procedures for the court to review the documents to
determine which, if any, are relevant to the proceedings.
   The judge has the power to delete certain secret material and
substitute statements of facts a particular document would prove.
   The so-called ``graymail'' statute was enacted by Congress in
1980 to facilitate prosecution of espionage cases and to control
the disclosure of classified information at trial.
   The procedures were envisioned to balance secrecy with the
government's need to use classified documents as evidence.
   Representatives of the Defense Department, the CIA, the National
Security Council, the FBI and the Justice Department are reviewing
the documents assembled by Walsh to determine if any can be
declassified.
   In his pleadings, Walsh said the documents ``describe in detail
some of the nation's most carefully held secrets about its foreign
policy, its intelligence activities and its covert activities.''
   The defendants filed a joint opposition to Walsh's motion for
expedited consideration of the proposed protective order, noting
that North and Poindexter had access to many of the documents when
they were at the National Security Council.
   The defense motion said Walsh's proposal raised a number of
issues about the constitutionality of the classified information
law as well as the independent counsel's power to represent the
government's national security interests.

   Nine Soviet scientists headed for the Nevada
desert on Wednesday to conduct tests they hope will prod the Reagan
administration toward a nuclear test ban treaty.
   Technicians from the Institute of Physics of the Earth under the
Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an American environmental group, are to set off two
non-nuclear explosions to test the ability of high-frequency
seismological devices to measure underground nuclear tests.
   ``We expect the experiment to produce new evidence on the
capability to verify a comprehensive or very low-yield test ban
treaty,'' said Thomas B. Cochran, a physicist with the
environmental group.
   The U.S. and Soviet scientists set off three explosions in
similar tests starting in September 1986 near the Soviet nuclear
test site at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.
   The head of the Soviet team, Nikolai F. Yukhnin, told reporters
Wednesday that the test results from Kazakhstan ``were perceived as
quite successful in the technical aspects.''
   Considerable political obstacles remain to a nuclear test ban
treaty, however.
   The administration refused to join a 19-month Soviet nuclear
test moratorium, which ended in February 1987. In addition, it
wants the Soviets to conduct tests of a system called CORRTEX to
supplement seismological monitoring of two nuclear threshold
treaties signed in the 1970s but never ratified by the Senate.
   Official teams of scientists visited each other's test sites in
Nevada and Kazakhstan last winter, but no date has been set for the
CORRTEX tests.
   The administration says the tests, which use a cable implanted
in the ground to measure yield, would be the first step in a
process leading to ratification of the threshold treaties and
perhaps to a pact banning nuclear weapons tests outright.
   Until the current visit, the State Department had denied visas
to Soviet scientists wishing to take part in the unofficial Natural
Resources Defense Council experiments, said S. Jacob Scherr, an
attorney for the group.
   Yukhnin said that within the Soviet government, ``the Foreign
Ministry has given full support to the experiments. I think that
the military people were not fully supportive. But they let us set
up experimental sites around the polygon,'' as the test site in
Kazakhstan is known.
   Cochran said the Nevada tests were designed to measure nuclear
blasts in the 1- to 10-kiloton range, well below the 150-kiloton
limit of the threshold treaties.
   A kiloton is a force equal to 1,000 pounds of TNT. The atomic
device exploded over Hiroshima at the close of World War II had a
force of 1.5 kilotons, or 15,000 pounds of TNT.
   Unlike earlier seismological equipment, Cochran said, the
high-frequency devices being used in Nevada may have the ability to
foil attempts to disguise the magnitude of underground nuclear
blasts. Such attempts could be made by a process known as
``de-coupling,'' or setting off the explosions in underground
caverns to make them seem smaller.
   To measure the Nevada tests, the Soviet team brought over one
ton of scientific devices, which Cochran described as ``some of the
most sophisticated seismological equipment in the world.''
   In addition to the team of nine scientists and technicians who
arrived in Washington on Tuesday and headed for Reno on Wednesday,
the head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Yevgeny Velikhov, was
to arrive in the United States on April 24 to observe the tests.
   One 10-ton explosion is scheduled for April 29 at Black Rock
Desert, 90 miles north of Reno; and another 15-ton blast at Broken
Hills, 100 miles east of Reno.

   A Roman Catholic priest sought on federal drug
trafficking charges has been arrested by Italian police in Bologna,
a federal prosecutor said Wednesday.
   Special Italian drug officers arrested the Rev. Lorenzo Zorza at
the home of a woman they described as an Italian art restorer, U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said.
   Zorza, 46, of New York City, was convicted in 1982 on a federal
customs charge for smuggling stolen art from Italy to the United
States.
   Giuliani, who had no other details of the arrest, said Zorza
would be turned over to U.S. authorities. He said the priest was
being brought to Rome along with another defendant in the case,
Rafael Fiumara, who was arrested in Italy ``a couple of days ago.''
   Zorza and Fiumara were among 39 people charged with
participating in a major international heroin and cocaine smuggling
ring with links to the Sicilian Mafia.

<HEAD>U.S. Declines to Present Arguments at World Court Hearing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has declined to present
arguments before a world court hearing on the closure of the
Palestine Liberation Organization mission to the U.N., saying
international arbitration of the case is not ``appropriate.''
   In a letter to the International Court of Justice in The Hague,
U.S. ambassador to The Netherlands John S. Shad noted that the 1987
Anti-Terrorism Law ordering the closure of the PLO Observer Mission
is being appealed in a U.S. court.
   ``Since the matter is still pending in our courts, we do not
believe arbitration would be appropriate,'' Shad wrote. A copy of
the letter was made available to The Associated Press.
   ``The United States respectfully declines the court's invitation
to submit further views on this issue'' at a hearing scheduled for
April 11, he added.
   Shad noted that Attorney General Edwin Meese III had concluded
that the law, which was signed last December by President Reagan,
calls for the closure of the mission ``irrespective of any
international legal obligations that the United States may have
under the Headquarters Agreement.''
   The 1947 agreement regulates the presence of foreign missions to
the U.N. in New York. The PLO and the United Nations contend that
the agreement, which regulates the presence of foreign missions to
the U.N. in New York, supersedes American law.
   The World Court has been asked by the U.N. to decide whether the
United States must submit to arbitration of the dispute over the
PLO mission. The U.S.-U.N. treaty calls for arbitration of disputes
but the United States has refused to submit to arbitration in this
case.
   Several weeks ago the Justice Department filed suit in U.S.
District Court in New York after the PLO refused to close down its
office. The PLO is expected to respond by April 11 and the United
Nations is expected to file a friend of the court brief supporting
its position.
   The PLO will not present any arguments before the world court
either, said its lawyer, Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney
general.
   The U.S. State Department ordered the PLO office in Washington
to shut down last year, contending the organization was a terrorist
group. Congress used a similar argument in ordering the closure of
the U.N. mission.

   Iraq fired four missiles into Tehran
Wednesday and its warplanes bombed eight other Iranian cities. Iran
said 40 civilians were killed, including three children who died
when a hospital nursery was hit.
   Iran said it fired two missiles into ``military centers'' in
Baghdad in retaliation and shelled Iraqi border towns.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported only one Iranian missile
exploding in Baghdad, saying it hit a residential neighborhood,
killing several civilians.
   Iraq said two Iranian jets bombed a packed football stadium in
the town of Kalar in the northeastern Sulaymaniyah province,
killing five schoolchildren and wounding 35 others.
   ``We will take revenge, and the Iranian regime will have to pay
dearly for its shameful crimes,'' the official Iraqi News Agency
quoted a military spokesman as saying.
   The Iraqis also said their fighter-bombers hit a ``very large
maritime target,'' which usually means a supertanker, near Iran's
Lavan Island oil terminal in the central Persian Gulf during the
night.
   There was no immediate independent confirmation of the strike.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi charged that the Iraqis
were stepping up their missile and air strikes to disrupt elections
Friday for Iran's 270-seat Majlis, or Parliament.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as
saying, ``These raids will fail to prevent the elections. On the
contrary, it will make our people more determined to cast their
votes.''
   The Iran news agency said five short-range missiles were fired
into Iraq's southern port of Basra.
   It said its anti-aircraft missiles batteries shot down a
Soviet-built Iraqi MiG-23 jet and a Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bomber
during two of the bombing raids. The MiG pilot was killed, it said,
but there was no immediate word on the Sukhoi pilot.
   Iraqi communiques said air force jets and helicopter gunships
flew more than 200 combat missions Wednesday and that only one
plane was lost.
   Iraq's missile barrage was seen as Baghdad's response to an
Iranian push into the northeastern mountains of Kurdistan.
   IRNA said Iranian air force fighters carried out six attacks on
Iraqi troop concentrations north of the Iranian bridgehead around
the strategic Lake Darbandikhan.
   It said Iranian artillery shelled the nearby provincial capital
of Sulaimaniyeh, including a power station, as fighting continued
in the region 75 miles east of Iraq's big Kirkuk oilfields.
   Iranian communiques said the Iraqi missiles hit residential
districts in Tehran, killing 16 civilians and wounding scores more.
   Three of the dead were children killed when a nursery in a
hospital was hit, the Iranians said. A hospital official told an
Associated Press correspondent that eight children were killed
there.
   IRNA said 21 other civilians were killed and dozens wounded in
Iraqi air raids on the western cities of Ilam, Dezful, Shustar and
four ther towns.
   Iran retaliated with artillery bombardments of Basra and other
Iraqi border cities throughout the day.
   Kamal Kharazzi, Iran's chief military spokesman, told a news
conference in Tehran: ``It isn't easy to intercept and track the
missiles.''
   He said: ``They move at very high speed. It's an exceptional
achievement that Iran has worked out any warning system at all.''
   Half of Tehran's 6 million population have fled the capital
since the ``war of the cities'' flared up Feb. 29. Both sides have
fired nearly 300 missiles into each other's cities, killing
hundreds on both sides.
   An Associated Press correspondent said lines of cars were seen
heading out of the city in the past two days. He said most people
were spending their nights in shelters, basements and underground
parking lots for safety.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says `Minority' Judgeship Should Not Be Allowed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUMBERTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white prosecutor running unopposed for
a judgeship that was created as an opportunity for minority
candidates says he opposes a plan agreed to by legislators to give
the county a second new judge.
   ``I'm very disappointed that the people who entered into this
agreement didn't consult with me or my advisers on it,'' Robeson
County District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt said about the plan,
which emerged Monday after the death of Britt's Lumbee Indian
opponent left no minority candidates in the contest. ``Personally,
I felt it was an unnecessary move.''
   Britt contended the plan to give the county two Superior Court
judges does not follow state law and ``is unfair to taxpayers.'' In
North Carolina, smaller counties are lumped into districts that
share judges.
   The General Assembly created a judgeship last year specifically
for Robeson County, which has a population that is 37 percent
Indian and 26 percent black, to give minority candidates a better
chance to become judge.
   But Britt, 52, automatically became the Democratic nominee for
the judgeship when his opponent, Julian Pierce, was slain March 26
in what police described as a romantic dispute. There is no
Republican candidate.
   Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan, the state's ranking Democrat, met with
legislators from Robeson County and minority leaders Monday to
develop the plan for a second judgeship.
   ``I don't really see how it can be justified,'' Britt told The
Fayetteville Observer on Tuesday. ``It's very unusual to have two
judges from an area the size of Robeson County.''
   ``Apparently a lot of people have been impressed by the claims
of support by Pierce supporters,'' Britt said. ``What's happened is
a very small group of people have run a very good bluff for some
politicians.''
   Franklin Freeman, director of the Administrative Office of the
Courts, said, the judgeship would cost the state $110,000 a year.
Since Superior Court judges in North Carolina can be assigned to
hear cases in any county, he said the extra judge's time would not
be wasted.
   ``There's no question we can fully utilize this new judgeship.
This will provide the extra judge power we believe is needed to
handle the extra case filings across the state.''

   Democrats may turn to New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo as their presidential nominee if neither Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis nor Jesse Jackson ``starts to win consistently
and by strong margins'' in the remaining primaries, Sen. Alan
Cranston said Wednesday.
   The California Democrat said he is remaining neutral in the
primaries and will vote at the national convention for the
candidate who ``appears to be best for the party.''
   Cranston told reporters that if either Dukakis or Jackson
emerges only a few delegates ahead of the other, that won't be
enough to persuade him or other ``super delegates'' to give the
nomination to the leader.
   ``My definition of someone emerging strongly is someone starting
to win consistently and by strong margins, and winding up with a
very significant lead in delegates on the eve of the convention,''
Cranston said.
   ``But if ... nobody's demonstrated the capacity to win and take
charge, then quite possibly the convention will look to someone
else for the nomination,'' he said. ``That person might well be
Governor Cuomo.''

<HEAD>Ministers Say Attacks On Jackson May Cost Gore Black Votes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some black ministers in the Nashville
area say Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s criticism of Jesse
Jackson could cost him black votes at home, says the Rev. James
Thomas.
   Since Jackson's victory and Gore's poor finish in Michigan,
``Gore, in desperation, has stooped to attacking the man and not
the message, the individual and not the issues, the person and not
his platform,'' Thomas told reporters Tuesday.
   ``I think it's racial although I can't pinpoint it,'' Thomas
said.
   Thomas, pastor of the Jefferson Street Missionary Baptist
Church, said ministers in the Nashville region are ``well aware of
the Democrats' hidden agenda _ the `stop Jesse Jackson' movement.''
   Interpreting Gore's comments as racist or personal would be
extreme, Gore spokesman Mark Armour said, who added that Gore is
attempting to highlight his national government experience and
Jackson's lack of such experience.
   ``Neither Reverend Jackson nor (Massachusetts Gov.) Michael
Dukakis has had a single day's experience in national government,''
Armour said.

   Helen Jackson, Jesse Jackson's mother,
is vying for a delegate slot at the Democratic National Convention
in Atlanta, but neither she nor party officials expect her to get

   Mrs. Jackson is among delegates to the state convention
competing to become national convention delegates from South
Carolina.
   ``It would be a kind gesture by South Carolina Democrats to
choose Mrs. Jackson as a national delegate,'' Chris Verenes,
executive director of the state party, said Tuesday.
   But, he said, ``the delegate-selection process is very
complicated, and there is no party rule that says Mrs. Jackson
should get special treatment.''
   Mrs. Jackson also said she does not expect any favors at the
party's April 16 state convention.
   ``I naturally would like to go to the national convention to do
everything I could for my son ... it would be a great honor,'' she
said. ``But I'm involved because I believe in constructive change

<HEAD>Shultz Says Palestinians Must Renounce Terror to Negotiate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Palestinians who renounce terror and
recognize Israel are welcome at Arab-Israeli peace talks, but not
the PLO or those ``who have committed acts of terrorism,''
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Wednesday.
   Shultz spoke in an interview that was televised in Israel as he
met with King Hussein of Jordan. It was taped in Jerusalem earlier
Wednesday.
   The secretary, who called Hussein ``a man of peace,'' hopes to
persuade the king and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel to
drop their reservations and agree to negotations.
   ``Say yes to this initiative,'' Shultz implored Shamir in a
statement after a final meeting with the prime minister Wednesday.
``Let us redouble our efforts to make it (peace) a reality.''
   As he passed the halfway point in his latest Middle East
venture, Shultz acknowledged having little to show for his second
visit to the region in a month.
   He said he was still committed to making the U.S. peace plan
work, but declared: ``In all candor, I am not able to say that it
is happening. While we have made some progress, differences have
not been substantially narrowed.''
   On departure from Ben Gurion airport, Shultz pledged U.S.
support for Israel and its security, but said in apparent criticism
of Shamir's reluctance: ``More fundamentally, security and progress
for Israel comes from peace between Israel and its neighbors. It is
possible. It can happen.''
   His next stop was Cairo, where President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
reaffirmed approval of the U.S. plan and said after talking with
Shultz that he hoped Shamir would change his ``conception ... for
the hope of peace.''
   Palestinian representation is among the most difficult unsettled
issues. In 1974, all Arab countries including Jordan declared the
PLO the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians.
   Mubarak and President Hafez Assad of Syria have called publicly
for a PLO seat in the negotiations, as have ranking Jordanian
officials.
   Shultz's plan would include Palestinians in a joint delegation
with Jordan, and U.S. officials have indicated the arrangement is
satisfactory to Hussein.
   In 1985, the king appeared to have worked out such an
arrangement with Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. It fell apart, and with it the prospects
for Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   In the interview with Israel television, Shultz said Hussein is
showing himself ``ready to be engaged'' in the latest U.S. effort
by raising questions about the proposal. It calls for talks on
Palestinian self rule, then negotiations on an overall settlement
of the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``He is a partner and is ready to talk and think and work and
try to find answers,'' Shultz said.
   He said Palestinians who take part in negotiations must be
legitimate representatives of the people in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, adding that ``in no way'' could Israel
simply choose Palestinians it likes.
   On the other hand, he said, the PLO is committed to violence and
Israel's destruction so Palestinians who want to negotiate should
be willing to ``step up and say `I renounce terrorism. I accept 242
and a basis for negotiation.'''
   His reference was to the U.N. Security Council resolution that
implies recognition of Israel and calls for it to withdraw from
occupied territory. It was passed after the 1967 Middle East war,
in which Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza from Jordan and
Egypt.
   In an interview Tuesday with Jordanian editors, the secretary
ruled out a Palestinian state, said total Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank and Gaza was ``not in the cards'' and accused the PLO
of trying to exterminate Israel.
   His comments were not published or broadcast in Jordan. One
official said fear of inflaming anti-American opinion in Jordan,
which has a Palestinian majority, was among the reasons for
withholding them.

   President Reagan, signing a
proclamation making April 11-16 National Productivity Improvement
Week, said Wednesday that U.S. business efficiency must be
increased to meet international competition.
   Reagan noted that American business productivity growth has been
declining since the mid-1960s, and said ``we must accelerate
productivity growth in the service and other sectors'' of the
economy.
   Productivity is a measure of the efficiency with which the
economy produces goods and services.
   Overall non-farm productivity in the United States grew by only
0.9 percent last year, although manufacturing efficiency grew at a
3.3 percent rate.
   ``Good performance in productivity is especially necessary now
that we are in world markets for most goods and services, and
because many of our foreign competitors can target the U.S. market
using state-of-the-art technology,'' Reagan's statement said.
   ``Our businesses and their individual leaders must continue
their efforts to increase productivity by adopting new technologies
and management innovations and by better strategic planning in the
increasingly competitive international context,'' it said.

   The jury reached a verdict Wednesday on
one charge in the trial of 13 white supremacists, and the judge
ordered further deliberations on two other counts despite the
jurors' contention that they were deadlocked.
   The jury said it reached a verdict on the charge of conspiracy
to assassination two federal officials, which had been brought
against five of the 13 defendants in the trial.
   Still undecided are the charges of seditious conspiracy, brought
against nine of the 13 defendants, and transporting stolen money, a
charge faced by two defendants. The government contends the
defendants planned to form an all-white nation in the Northwest.
   Judge Morris Arnold received the verdict involving an alleged
plan _ never carried out _ to assassinate a federal judge and an
FBI agent, but he told the court clerk not to make it public.
   The jurors, in a note to Arnold, said they were at a stalemate
on the other two counts. But Arnold said he would not discharge the
jury ``after only two days of deliberation after two months of
trial.''
   The jurors then resumed deliberations for a time before breaking
off talks for the day late Wednesday afternoon.
   The judge told the jurors Monday that he preferred to receive
the verdicts all at once. Sixteen verdicts of guilty or innocent
are possible.
   Robert E. Miles, one of the most outspoken supremacist leaders
on trial, arrived at the courthouse with, as usual, comment for
reporters:
   ``The tumbrels are coming, the guillotine is being prepared,
your bloodthirst will be satisfied, your editors will be happy.''
   When asked why the government would prosecute him, Miles said,
``Jealousy, pure jealousy, nothing but jealousy'' of ``all the
attention you fellows and your editors have given me.''
   Did he ever advocate establishing an all-white nation in the
northwest?
   ``Only in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Cohoctah,'' Miles answered.
   Miles, 63, is from Cohoctah, Mich., where he is pastor of the
Mountain Church of Jesus Christ.
   Miles and two other defendants _ Richard G. Butler, 70, of
Hayden Lake, Idaho, and Louis R. Beam Jr., 41, of Houston, Texas _
are regarded as the top leaders of supremacist groups.
   Butler, pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ, Christian, in
Hayden Lake, established the Aryan Nations. Beam, an ex-leader of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas, became an
ambassador-at-large for the Aryan Nations. Butler, who is free on a
$100,000 signature bond, and Beam, who is held without bond, are,
like Miles, accused of conspiring to bring down the government by
force.
   The trial began Feb. 16. The government called 113 witnesses,
the defense 79.
   The seditious conspiracy charge has a maximum penalty of 20
years in jail and a $20,000 fine. Conspiracy to murder federal
officials can be punished by imprisonment for life. Two defendants
are charged with transporting stolen money, which has a maximum
punishment of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   The government said supremacist groups robbed banks and armored
trucks of $4.1 million to finance their activities, including about
$1 million which has not been recovered. Several bombings and some
murders also occurred, the government said
   Defendants contend that the conspiracy theory was made up by a
key government witness, James Ellison, 47, who led a supremacist
group in Arkansas and now is serving 20 years for racketeering.
   Six of the seditious conspiracy defendants are serving sentences
ranging from 40 years to imprisonment for life, including one death
sentence, on charges of racketeering, murder, or violation of civil
rights by murder.

<HEAD>Justice Changes Stand On Judicial Review Of Deportation for Asylum
Seekers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department retreated Wednesday
from a stand that would have barred aliens facing deportation from
having their asylum requests heard before an immigration judge.
   Earlier rules proposed last Aug. 28 would have required that all
claims for asylum and withholding of deportation be heard by asylum
officers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Civil liberties groups say INS is unsympathetic to
asylum-seekers, an accusation the agency denies.
   Under the latest proposed revision, immigration judges _ who
work for the Justice Department, not INS _ would continue to
conduct adversarial proceedings for those asylum-seekers facing
exclusion from the United States or deportation.
   The change ``is an important improvement,'' said Arthur Helton,
a attorney for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   Initial asylum applications will be heard by INS asylum
officers. But those officers will receive training from the Justice
Department.
   Helton, however, objected to provisions in the new set of
proposals which permit immigration judges to deny full evidentiary
hearings in certain instances.
   Helton also said the regulations fail to take into account that
asylum applicants frequently fail to present asylum claims
immediately for fear of reprisals against friends and family
members by the government of their home country. The U.S.
government has the power to reject asylum claims that are made
following the conclusion of deportation proceedings.
   The revised rule, published in the Federal Register, will become
final after a 30-day public comment period.
   The proposed regulations are in large measure a response to a
March 1987 Supreme Court ruling which held that asylum applicants
need only show a reasonable fear of persecution in order to gain
asylum, rather than the previous threshold of clear probability of
persecution.

   President Reagan signed legislation
proclaiming April 8 as Dennis Chavez Day, to mark the 100th
anniversary of the birth of the first native-born Hispanic elected
to the U.S. Senate.
   Reagan called on all Americans to join in ``saluting the memory
of this public servant who left school as a child to help support
his family and went on to become a lawyer, state representative,
U.S. congressman and U.S. senator.''
   ``As a senator, Dennis Chavez chaired the Committee on Public
Works and served on the defense appropriations subcommittee,'' the
proclamation said. ``He sought the well-being of every American and
displayed lasting concern for those in need.''
   ``Dennis Chavez truly exemplified the dedication of the public
servant and won distinction in the service of New Mexico and of his
nation,'' it said. ``To this day, his life and career symbolizes
the countless achievements of Hispanic Americans and demonstrates
the opportunity America offers.''

   A veterans' group Wednesday agreed to
admit ``anyone presenting a ticket'' to an oyster dinner it has
held for men only for 39 years but said this is the last year it
will conduct the event.
   ``Men have a right to have a stag party,'' the West Virginia
chapter of the Forty & Eight Lasociete said in a statement. ``This
has always been a classy affair sponsored by a classy organization.
We are not pigs and neither are we backward.''
   The dinner, expected to attract 1,200 people Friday, is a
favorite campaign stop for candidates. But Republican congressional
candidate Marianne Brewster said she had been told she would not be
admitted because she is a woman, even though she bought a ticket.
   Other candidates subsequently said they would not show up unless
women were allowed.
   Attorney General Charlie Brown, also seeking re-election this
year, entered the fray Tuesday with a letter to McDowell County
school Superintendent J. Kenneth Roberts pointing out that the
dinner site, a high school in the county, is public property and
anyone with a ticket must be allowed to attend.
   ``We all would agree West Virginia needed progressive changes,''
Brewster said Wednesday. ``This is one giant step in that
direction.''
   The Forty & Eight chapter said no one will be allowed into the
event without a ticket, no tickets will be sold at the door and it
will discontinue the dinners, its only fund-raising event, after
this year.
   ``It is unfortunate that outsiders who could have directed
attention to the event and what results from it instead chose to
enhance their own welfare,'' the organization said. ``They should
have been making statements about the good things that result from
the event.''
   Money from the $15-a-ticket dinner goes toward sponsorship of
groups such as the Little League and Special Olympics, the
statement said.
   Forty & Eight, based nationally in Indianapolis, began as an
honorary society for American Legion members, but the groups are
now separate and Legion officials in West Virginia dissociated
themselves from the stag affair.
   ``We split in 1972. We don't even allow Forty & Eight lapel pins
on people in our parades, that's how much we split,'' said Robert
Vass, state adjutant for the Legion.
   ``It's just a redneck approach,'' he said of the stag dinner.
``This is 1988! You don't disenfranchise a congressional candidate
because she's a woman.''

   The government on Wednesday advised
international relief agencies to remove their foreign workers from
two drought-stricken northern regions because of increasing rebel
violence.
   The government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission said the
Tigray and Eritrea regions no longer are safe for the foreign
agencies.
   ``In recent weeks the emergency relief aid distribution by the
(commission) and international donor organizations has been
disrupted by terrorists engaged in destructive activities against
the unity, integrity and freedom of Ethiopia,'' the commission said
in a two-page statement distributed to foreign aid groups.
   ``In addition to the destruction of trucks flying the United
Nations flag and transportation of relief supplies, the bandits
have time and again kidnapped expatriates in the regions,'' it said.
   The commission said foreigners should stay out of the north
``until the areas are freed from terrorist activity and tranquility
is restored to the life of the civilian population in the areas.''
   The government agency asked donors and international relief
agencies to turn over their operations to the commission to
guarantee the continuity of aid to the starving.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said Ethiopia's food crisis is becoming more severe because
there is not enough security for aid workers.
   ``We're naturally concerned that any diminution of the
international relief effort will have a negative impact on the
lives of starving people,'' she said.
   ``Clearly, in an unpredictable war situation, safety for relief
personnel is also a serious consideration,'' she said. ``We hope
that the Ethiopian government will take steps to ensure the safety
of relief personnel as well.''
   Last week, President Mengistu Haile Mariam told Ethiopians in a
radio address that government troops were facing a ``grim
struggle'' against separatist rebels in Eritrea and Tigray.
Mengistu said the government was mobilizing troops to crush the
rebellions.
   Separatist rebels have been fighting for 27 years in Eritrea and
14 years in Tigray.
   The fighting has disrupted relief efforts in both regions, where
crop failures threaten 3.5 million people with starvation. Overall,
nearly 7 million Ethiopians are facing famine.
   There are about 60 non-governmental relief organizations working
in Ethiopia, but only a few operate in Eritrea and Tigray. Agencies
operating in the area include the International Committee of the
Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders of Belgium and Catholic Relief
Services.
   Most of the relief agencies in Ethiopia arrived during a 1984-85
drought and famine that killed an estimated 1 million Ethiopians.
It prompted the biggest aid effort in history.
   Most foreign agencies pared their expatriate staffs after the
1984-85 emergency and turned over programs to Ethiopians. Exact
numbers of foreign workers still in Ethiopia were not immediately
available.

   The demand made by hijackers of a Kuwaiti
jet is the same as that made by Moslems holding Americans hostage
in Lebanon _ freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists jailed in Kuwait
for bombing U.S. and French embassies there in 1983.
   The Arab hijackers forced the airliner to fly to Iran on Monday.
   Their nationality and identity remain unknown, but speculation
arose that they might be part of an Iranian-linked network of
terrorists.
   Kuwait, a small, oil-rich desert emirate caught in the crossfire
of the Iran-Iraq war, refuses to free any of the 17 prisoners and
reiterated Tuesday that Kuwait will not bow to ``blackmail.''
   The passengers and crew held hostage aboard Kuwait Airways
Flight 422 have apparently become pawns in a war between followers
of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and foes of his Islamic revolution.
   The same could be said about Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, and educator Thomas
Sutherland, two Americans held captive in Lebanon since 1985.
   Kuwait is a conservative state ruled by Sunni Moslems, historic
rivals of the Shiite sect who make up the vast majority of Iran's
50 million people.
   Kuwait fears that Iran's fundamentalist Islamic revolution will
spread, inciting its Shiite minority to revolt.
   Other Arab neighbors of Iran in the Persian Gulf have similar
fears.
   Spurred by Khomeini's revolution and by the 1982 invasion of
Lebanon by Israel, Lebanon's Shiites launched suicide bombings
against the Israelis and later against U.S. and French troops who
took part in an ill-fated multinational peacekeeping force in
Lebanon.
   Shiite extremists have targeted Kuwait in particular over the
past five years. Iran accuses Kuwait of aiding Iraq in the Persian
Gulf war.
   The 17 prisoners in Kuwait were convicted of bombings in 1983
that killed five people and wounded 86, culminating in attacks on
the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait.
   Later terrorist attacks on Kuwait included an abortive 1985
assassination attempt on the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah.
   Three of the 17 prisoners _ two Iraqis and a Lebanese identified
as Elias Fuad Saab _ were sentenced to death.
   The Shiite kidnappers in Lebanon are concerned in particular
about Saab, whose real name is Mustafa Youssef. He is a cousin of
Imad Mugniyeh, believed by Western and Lebanese intelligence to be
the mastermind of Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, and other extremist
Shiite factions responsible for suicide bombings, kidnappings and
aircraft hijackings in recent years.
   Western intelligence officials believe Saab rigged the bombs
used in the Kuwait attacks.
   Kuwait has so far not carried out any of the executions, but
that seems to have been its only concession. It has arrested dozens
of other Shiites for sabotage since 1983.
   Mugniyeh, 36, is a key figure in the security apparatus of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed Shiite movement
believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 22
foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   His family has been long linked with the Hamadis, another Shiite
clan involved in kidnappings.
   U.S. authorities identified Mugniyeh and Mohammed Ali Hamadi,
held in West Germany on charges of smuggling explosives, as two of
the four Lebanese Shiites involved in the June 1985 hijacking of a
TWA airliner in which U.S. Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem was
killed.
   The Hamadis allegedly kidnapped three West Germans in Beirut
trying to force West Germany to free Mohammed and a brother, Abbas,
who now is on trial in Duesseldorf for kidnapping two Germans. A
third Hamadi brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is Hezbollah's security
chief in Beirut.
   Members of the Mugniyeh family are thought to have kidnapped
Anderson, who was seized March 16, 1985, and is the longest held of
the missing foreigners.

   Two years after Clint Eastwood rode into
this seaside resort and was elected mayor, the lanky movie star
banged his last gavel and presided over his last City Council
meeting.
   ``I wouldn't trade the last two years for anything,'' Eastwood
said at Tuesday night's meeting. ``I have always felt if we took
our work seriously but didn't take ourselves seriously, we'd be a
much happier community. I'll be out there sitting with you next
time, and we'll all have some laughs with it.''
   Eastwood wished good luck to the mayoral candidates running in
next week's election.
   His term expires in May, and he announced earlier this year that
he wouldn't seek a second term.
   His entry into politics was partly inspired by a long battle
with planning officials over a two-story commercial and office
building he wanted to build next to his Hog's Breath Inn. He
considered the community hostile to developers.
   Eastwood's departure from office will end the frequent lines of
tourists outside council meetings.
   For some, Eastwood's ride into the sunset was a happy occasion.
   ``It's kind of nice to have it all over with. We all enjoyed it,
but the carnival's over now,'' said Clayton Anderson, one of six
candidates vying to succeed Eastwood.

<HEAD>Reagan Imposes Sanctions Against Japan</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: INSERTS 1 graf after 8th graf pvs, bgng: ``Under provisions
...'' to add that Japan currently has no fishing quota.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan informed Congress
Wednesday that he has stripped Japan of certain fishing rights
because of that country's alleged violation of an international
whale conservation program.
   Reagan said the Commerce Department had certified the violations
based on permits Japan has issued for the killing of Southern
Hemisphere minke whales for research purposes.
   ``The sanctions are the strongest possible'' under legislation
authorizing presidential action, Reagan said in a letter to House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   The administration maintains that Japan has run afoul of an
International Whaling Commission whale conservation program by
issuing permits for research that has never been approved by the
IWC.
   The issuance of the permits by Japan to its citizens came
despite a 1987 whaling commission resolution recommending that no
such licenses be granted until questions about the research program
were resolved, Reagan's letter said.
   It noted that shortly after the certification of the violations
by Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, the whaling commission
adopted a second resolution recommending that Japan not go ahead
with its research program.
   ``Japan has continued its whaling activities notwithstanding
this second resolution,'' the letter said.
   Under provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
Management Act and the Fishermen's Protective Act, Reagan directed
the State Department to withhold 100 percent of the fishing
privileges ``that would otherwise be available to Japan'' in waters
under U.S. authority.
   The current Japanese fishing quota in the 200-mile offshore U.S.
economic zone is zero.
   Reagan said he was denying Japan's request to fish for 3,000
metric tons of sea snails and 5,000 metric tons of Pacific whiting.
   ``In addition, Japan will be barred from any future allocations
of fishing privileges for any other species, including Pacific cod,
until the secretary of commerce determines that the situation has
been corrected,'' he said.
   Ken Cook, spokesman for the U.S. affiliate of the World Wildlife
Fund, said the announced fishing sanctions ``would hurt some,'' but
came too late to save any of the 300 minke whales Japan plans to
take in this year's research program.
   Reagan's letter to Wright said that ``the immediate and
prospective effects of a 100 percent reduction of fishing
allocations, coupled with presidential review in the near future,
is the most effective means of encouraging Japan to embrace the IWC
conservation program.''
   ``Therefore, I will not impose at this time'' any sanctions
against Japanese fish products imported into the United States, it
said.
   Reagan ordered Verity and Secretary of State George Shultz to
report by Dec. 1 on Japan's willingness to comply with the whaling
conservation program.
   He also said he was directing Verity and Shultz to continue
talks with whaling commission member countries ``to ensure that we
bring to a halt all whaling that diminishes the effectiveness of
the IWC's conservation program.''
   ``Our actions taken today and in the future should encourage all
nations to adhere to the conservation programs of the IWC,'' the
president's letter said.

   A holiday hike by Israeli
teen-agers ended Wednesday in a melee of shooting and
stone-throwing in an Arab town in which a 14-year-old Israeli girl
and two Palestinians were killed.
   Hours after the clash, Jewish settlers raided the nearby Arab
village of Hawwara, smashing car windshields, beating villagers and
breaking into homes, said Jihad Howari, the Israeli-appointed head
of the village council.
   The girl's death was the first of an Israeli civilian in the
violence that has swept the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since
Dec. 8. At least 140 Arabs have died, according to U.N. figures,
and one Israeli soldier has been killed.
   The youngsters, children of Jewish settlers on the occupied West
Bank, were on a Passover outing and had stopped for a picnic lunch
when the trouble began with stone-throwing. Members of the group
said Arabs offering to help then led them to Beita.
   Arabs wrestled two automatic rifles from the group's two Israeli
guards but did not fire them, the army reported.
   Arab witnesses said the Israelis started the trouble by killing
a Palestinian.
   Army spokesmen originally said the girl, Tirza Porat, and
several other teen-agers were shot but reported later that she was
killed by a rock.
   Eleven of the 18 hikers, the 60-year-old man acting as guide and
one of the two Israeli guards were injured and two Palestinians
were wounded by gunfire, the army said.
   Dozens of settlers waving an Israeli flag later held a nighttime
vigil about half a mile from Beita, and said they would build a new
settlement in the area. Army officials said the settlers left after
several hours at the urging of troops who surrounded the village.
   Scores of angry settlers also demonstrated in front of Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's home and called on him to resign, Israel
radio said.
   Israelis have been especially sensitive to the possibility of
attacks on children, and warnings followed Wednesday's fatal
confrontation.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said on Israel radio: ``Israel
will cut off the murderers' hands and will not let the evil terror
achieve its aim.''
   According to Israeli witnesses and the army, the hikers stopped
for a picnic lunch in a dry riverbed just outside Beita, 10 miles
southeast of Nablus. Shmuel Fuchs, 15, said they had just sat down
when a group of Arabs started throwing rocks.
   The Israelis left the area, but ``soon we discovered we were
being followed by dozens of Arabs,'' said Fuchs, whose right arm
and chest were bandaged. He spoke from his bed in Jerusalem's
Hadassah Hospital.
   He said some of the Arabs, apparently wanting to help, offered
to lead the teen-agers out of the area through Beita, a town of
about 12,000 people.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, said dozens of
people began throwing stones at the youngsters in Beita and the
shooting started. He said the Israeli girl and the two Arabs were
killed during the battle.
   Israel television showed CBS footage of Israeli teen-agers
inside the village, some with blood stains on their faces and
clothes, screaming at cameramen to call the army for help.
   One Israeli youngster wearing a skullcap, the tradional head
cover of observant Jews, waved a red scarf at a helicopter hovering
overhead as Arab ambulance attendants rushed the wounded into their
vehicles.
   A cameraman was seen consoling a girl who crouched beside a
puddle of blood.
   Shomron told reporters outside Beita some residents tried to
help the Israeli youngsters, including several women who hid three
girls inside their homes.
   ``I want to say that within this event there were locals who
tried to protect the children from the others,'' he said. ``We
certainly thank those who helped.''
   The army said one teen-ager was held hostage briefly, but was
found by soldiers in a house-to-house search.
   Arab witnesses claimed the Israelis provoked the clash.
   They said the armed guards fired on Arabs who approached the
Israelis, killing a 19-year-old Palestinian, and his angry
companions then charged the hikers.
   ``The first man who was killed, Mousa Saleh Abu Shamseh, was
plowing his land,'' said Mohammed Abbas Aly, 20, who said he was in
the field when the fight took place.
   ``When people heard a farmer was killed they attacked the
settlers with axes, picks and rocks. There was hand-to-hand
fighting,'' he said in an interview at Al Ittihad Hospital in
Nablus.

   A two-man U.N. team will leave for Baghdad
on Thursday to investigate Iraq's charges that Iran has used
chemical weapons, spokesman Francois Giuliani said Wednesday.
   The same team went to Tehran last week to look into Iranian
charges that Iraq used gas bombs last month that killed 5,000
people, but no report has been released. The Persian Gulf neighbors
have been at war since September 1980.
   Iraq was angered by the U.N. team's visit to Tehran. It accused
the United Nations of siding with Iran and asked Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, for whom Giuliani speaks, to conduct a
similar investigation of Iran's tactics.
   Tehran radio quoted Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati as
saying the decision to send the team to Iran was ``surprising'' and
he had written to Perez de Cuellar to complain.
   The secretary-general has said there was evidence that Iraq has
used chemical weapons and appealed to both sides to stop attacking
civilian targets.
   Perez de Cuellar met Wednesday with Iran's deputy foreign
minister, Mohammed Javad Larijani, and is to meet next week with
Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister.

   Scriptwriters enter the second month of their
strike against producers with no sign of renewed talks, while
advertisers and striking commercial actors met with a federal
mediator in New York on Wednesday.
   The strike by the Writers Guild of America against the Alliance
of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which began March 7,
has shortened the season of several television shows, caused
production postponement of spring replacement series and pilot
shows, and could threaten next fall's television season.
   In the commercial actors' strike, representatives for the
combined Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Radio and
Television Artists met with a federal mediator Wednesday in New
York City in a session that could lead to resumption of talks.
   The 100,000 members of the two actors unions went on strike
March 21 against the Joint Policy Committee of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National
Advertisers.
   The unions have since signed more than 550 interim contracts
with companies that want to resume commercial production. Among
them are advertising agencies for four of the presidential
candidates _ Vice President George Bush, former television
evangelist Pat Robertson, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, Screen Actors Guild spokesman Mark
Locher said Wednesday.
   The unions received a letter of written support from Jesse
Jackson's campaign, which also noted that Jackson has not used
actors in his commercials.
   In the writers' strike, the two sides have not met since a March
10 federally mediated session, and there are no immediate prospects
of resumed negotiations. Informal talks two weeks ago between guild
executive director Brian Walton and the producers' chief
negotiator, Nick Counter, failed to bring results.
   Meanwhile, scores of independent producers and some members of
the alliance have requested separate negotiations with the guild.
There have been no agreements reached as a result of those talks,
guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said.
   The majority of those seeking independent contracts with the
guild are television production companies, Rhoden confirmed, but
she denied that reaching any agreement with them would create a
rift between working television writers and still-striking movie
writers.
   ``If there were an independent agreement, and that is a very big
`if,' it would have to be responsive to all our members' needs,''
she said. ``Just because someone is doing a television show now
doesn't mean they might not pick up a movie project next.''
   A rift between television and movie writers during a 1985 strike
by the Writers Guild caused confusion and rancor among the members.
During that strike, television writers felt they were being forced
on strike to support movie writers seeking higher residuals from
videocassette sales.
   Rhoden said there were no plans to picket next Monday's Academy
Awards show, although the guild will be monitoring it to make sure
no violations occur with the guild-written script for the
three-hour broadcast on ABC-TV.
   The script was about 90 percent complete when writers went on
strike. Rhoden also said the guild offered no guidelines on whether
striking members who have received nominations should show up for
the awards.
   ``We are leaving it up to them,'' she said.
   Producers representatives have said several times that they are
standing by their last and final offer made at the start of the
strike. The Sherman Oaks-based alliance has said its proposal would
raise writers' pay by $50 million over three years, despite calling
for a reduction in residual payments for some one-hour TV shows.
   Writers have claimed their own analysis of the offer shows it
would result in a loss of more than $37.8 million for its 9,000
members.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fired tear gas and birdshot to
break up an opposition demonstration in Panama City Wednesday, as
the United States completed deployment of 1,300 extra troops to
Panama.
   Hundreds of onlookers shouted insults at police who dispersed
about 50 people marching to protest the economic crisis and the
strongman rule of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Residents and
shopkeepers hurled garbage into the streets and set fire to piles
of refuse.
   A state-owned television station reported that two U.S. soldiers
in an Army jeep were stopped and detained by Panamanian troops near
the demonstration. Major Ann Crum of the U.S. Southern Command said
the soldiers were released an hour later.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _Panama's civilian chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma,
announced the government had agreed to talks with opposition groups
``without preconditions or irreconcilable demands.''
   _The Reagan administration said that 800 Marines would start
arriving in Panama on Friday for what it described as routine
jungle training. ``They will be there for three weeks and then they
will come out,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the president's chief
spokesman. He said the move was not related to the dispatch of
troops to protect the U.S. Southern Command.
   Panama's opposition, which has been seeking Noriega's ouster for
more than 10 months, sponsored a ``march against hunger'' Wednesday
afternoon, but police flooded the park where it was to take place.
   Nonetheless, about 50 protesters met at a nearby church and
began a march to the central business district.
   They had gone nearly a mile when police stopped them with a
barrage of tear gas and birdshot.
   Hundreds of people jeered at the police from sidewalks and
balconies despite the swirls of tear gas that enveloped blocks of
Central Avenue, the main shopping thoroughfare.
   Many onlookers threw garbage into the avenue and sidestreets and
set fire to piles of refuse. It took more than an hour for police
to restore order.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, who spoke on
condition he was not identified, said two American soldiers
apparently got lost and drove into the area by accident. He said
the Army was investigating the case.
   The march was designed to protest a deteriorating economic
situation that has left thousands of Panamanians penniless.
   Panamanians began a run on the banks in late February after
Noriega supporters removed President Eric Arturo Delvalle from
office, and banks closed on March 4. The country's economic crisis
has been exacerbated by the freezing of Panamanian deposits in U.S.
banks and sanctions imposed by Washington.
   Police halted one demonstration Tuesday with a heavy show of
force and restricted another at the Panama Canal administration
building.
   The new U.S. soldiers arriving at Howard Air Force Base, just
outside Panama City, included members of an Army aviation battalion
from Fort Ord, Calif., and military police and security specialists
from Fort Bragg, N.C. and Fort Mead, Md.
   They were ferried to Panama by a fleet of C-141 Starlifter and
C-5 Galaxy jet cargo planes. The aviators brought 26 helicopters,
including seven powerful AH-1 Cobra gunships.
   Chief Warrant Officer Tommy J. McCoin of Redmond, Ore., a Cobra
pilot, said the mission was a training exercise, not a buildup for
military action against Panama.
   ``We've got too big a heart to be invading,'' he said.
   The new soldiers joined more than 10,500 American military
personnel already based in the Latin American country to protect
the Panama Canal until it is turned over to the Panamanian
government by treaty at the turn of the century.
   In ordering the buildup last week, the Pentagon said the new
troops were needed to provide security for U.S. citizens and
installations because of Noriega's ``heavy-handed tactics.''
   Panama has called the deployment a prelude to invasion.
   Solis Palma said he had been delegated by Noriega, chief of the
15,000-strong Defense Forces, to represent the general in any talks
mediated by Panama's Roman Catholic archbishop, Monsignor Marcos
Gregorio McGrath.
   It was not known if the opposition would accept Solis Palma as
the general's representative, since they still recognize Delvalle.
   There was no comment from the government on whether it would
meet the opposition groups' conditions for talks, which include a
demand that Noriega set an early date for his resignation.
   McGrath was asked to mediate the crisis last week by President
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Spain's prime minister, Felipe
Gonazalez, and ex-presidents Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and
Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica.
   Delvalle was dismissed by the Noriega-controlled National
Assembly in retaliation for his attempt to force the general's
resignation.
   The dismissal triggered an economic crisis that has left the
government unable to pay its debts or the salaries of its 15,000
soldiers and 130,000 civilian employees.

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Senate, convening as an
impeachment court for the last time, voted Wednesday to pay deposed
Gov. Evan Mecham's legal fees for the trial which removed him from
office.
   ``The time has come to take the first step, extend the hand for
a handshake and say this is over,'' Mecham's attorney, Jerris
Leonard, said in requesting payment of $202,433.75. ``Let's start
the healing process.''
   Leonard told the Senate that he, attorney Fred Craft and their
assistants were assured of being paid in any case.
   The Senate approved the payment on a vote of 16-13.
   Several senators urged the payment as a sign of compassion,
though some other senators were annoyed that Mecham had been on
national television a few hours earlier proclaiming his innocence.
   In an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Mecham said
he might appeal his conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Leonard said after the Senate session that he would have to
study the legal issues before he could decide on attempting an
appeal.
   Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank X. Gordon told a news
conference later in the day that the Senate was Mecham's ``court of
last resort'' and he can't appeal.
   Also on Wednesday, two Phoenix residents sued seeking to cancel
the May 17 gubernatorial recall election as unnecessary.
   Rose Mofford, the former secretary of state, was sworn in as
Mecham's successor Tuesday. On Wednesday, a Maricopa County
Superior Court judge rejected a bid to have her name barred from
the ballot in the event a recall election goes forward.
   Mecham had said in his TV interview that he plans to run in the
May 17 recall election if the courts rule that his name can be on
the ballot. Arizona's acting secretary of state has ordered
Mecham's name removed pending a resolution of legal issues.
   ``I've never had more support,'' Mecham said, adding that he
believed he could win the recall election. ``I'll definitely run in
it unless they get it so tied up in legal technicalities,'' he said.
   One senator, Democrat Jesus ``Chuy'' Higuera, cited Mecham's
interview as grounds for not paying of his legal fees.
   If Mecham were elected again, he'd probably be impeached again
and the Senate would be stuck with a precedent for paying his fees,
Higuera said.
   Republican John Mawhinney, who voted against paying the fees,
said the impeachment was Mecham's fault and ``we are not allowed to
buy compassion.''
   Mecham, 63, was convicted Monday on charges that he tried to
thwart a death-threat investigation and misused $80,000 from a
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   He was only the seventh U.S. governor to be convicted in an
impeachment trial and the first to be removed from office in 59
years. The trial began. Feb. 29.
   The presiding officer, Gordon, reported that attorney Murray
Miller had telephoned asking that the Senate consider paying his
bill for Mecham's defense too.
   Leonard said Miller had been paid in full, a total of $110,000.
   ``Frankly, I've had enough of Murray Miller and his antics,''
said Leonard. ``He doesn't belong in this body. He doesn't
represent the governor.''
   Leonard replaced Miller as Mecham's chief attorney just before
the impeachment trial.
   Miller, who was said by his office to be busy meeting with a
client, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
   After senators passed a resolution of thanks and gave a standing
ovation to Gordon, the presiding officer asked if there were
further motions.
   ``Mr. Presiding Officer, we urge no more motions,'' said
prosecutor William French. ``We say amen.''

<HEAD>U.S. Gives Boats to Fight Cocaine Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICARDO ROJAS LEON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese III gave two confiscated high-speed boats to military
authorities here Wednesday for use against drug traffickers.
   Smugglers use this Caribbean island nation as a transshipment
point for cocaine coming in from South America and bound for the
United States.
   ``The Dominican Republic seems to be determined ... that
narcotics trafficking should be totally eliminated,'' Meese told
Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera, the armed forces minister.
   He made his remarks as he and other officials from the United
States and the Dominican Republic stood near the long, sleek boats,
capable of speeds of more than 65 mph.
   The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti. Drug runners have turned to the island as governments on the
neighboring islands of Jamaica and Puerto Rico tightened
surveillance of boats and planes.
   President Joaquin Balaguer, elected to a fifth term in May 1986,
has made the war on drugs a top priority. In December 1986, the
Dominican air force shot down a small plane that did not identify
itself upon demand. Officials later said it was carrying hundreds
of pounds of cocaine.
   In recent months, police and soldiers have seized cocaine
shipments weighing hundreds of pounds and valued at millions of
dollars. But suspected smugglers in high-powered boats often outran
the patrol boats of the Dominican coast guard.
   ``These (confiscated boats) are going to put the Dominican
Republic one step ahead of the smugglers,'' one U.S. official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The boats were confiscated from traffickers apprehended while
trying to smuggle drugs into the United States, he said.
   One is a 31-foot Chris Craft Scorpion with twin 235 horsepower
Mercury engines and the other a 33-foot Sonic Carrera 33RX, he
said. The value of the boats, delivered from Florida by U.S. Coast
Guard C-130s, was not disclosed.
   The United States also plans to supply five small, twin-engined
Cessnas to the Dominican air force under the Military Assistance
Program.
   Accompanying Meese were his wife Ursula; the chief of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, John Lawn; Frank Keating, the Treasury
Department's assistant secretary for enforcement; Mark Dion, the
State Department's deputy assistant secretary; and Mike Skol,
director of State's Office of Andean Affairs.
   The stop in Santo Domingo was Meese's first in a Latin American
tour that began Wednesday.
   Meese arrived by Air Force jet and was due to leave Santo
Domingo on Thursday.
   On Wednesday, Meese met with Balaguer at the National Palace,
then with Foreign Affairs Minister Donald Reid Cabral.

<TEXT>
   The justice minister said the
Netherlands' longest running kidnap case was solved with five
arrests on Wednesday, but said the victim was ``almost certainly
dead,'' Dutch television reported.
   Retail tycoon Gerrit-Jan Heyn, 65, was kidnapped nearly seven
months ago. In reporting on Justice Minister Frits Korthals Altes'
announcement, the TV account gave no details on what happened to
Heyn.
   It said six suspects were arrested in a pre-dawn raid Wednesday
in Landsmeer, 10 miles north of Amsterdam, but one was released
later in the day. The report did not identify any of the group, in
line with Dutch police practice.
   The television report said the five were thought to hold part of
a ransom of more than $4.3 million in cash and diamonds paid for
Heyn on Nov. 27.
   Among those held was a 45-year old architect, whose house police
staked out for weeks, the TV report said. It was there the six were
arrested, it said.
   Police were not immediately available to comment on the
televison report.
   Heyn, vice chairman of the Ahold grocery concern, was kidnapped
on Sept. 9 near his sumptuous villa in Bloemendaal, 20 miles west
of The Hague.
   A month later, the kidnappers mailed one of Heyn's fingers to
Ahold as proof they were holding him. They never gave further proof
Heyn was still alive.
   A 70-member police team was organized to solve the kidnapping.
It soon imposed an information blackout on the case, which was
lifted in December when authorities launched a national publicity
blitz and promised a million-guilder ($550,000) reward for
information leading to the kidnappers' arrest.
   Police arrested a suspect in January but had to release him for
lack of evidence.

<TEXT>
   State authorities announced Wednesday
they will make public most of files of the Los Angeles Police
Department's investigation of the 1968 assassination of Robert F.
Kennedy, including the department's final, uncensored investigative
report.
   The huge file, to be made public April 19, have been stored in
the state archives since last August, and include some 2,500
photographs, 50,000 square feet of written material and interviews
with 4,000 witnesses.
   Most of the material has been sealed since 1969, although a
partial summary of the files was released in 1986.
   Secretary of State March Fong Eu, whose office has custody of
the files, said officials will ``release all materials except those
prohibited by specific laws and those which fall within another law
enforcement agency's jurisdiction.'' The withheld material includes
autopsy photos, juvenile records and fingerprint cards.
   Most of the documents to be released have never before been made
public, Eu said. She added that much of the manuscript material is
``fragile and faded'' and of an ```irreplaceable nature.''
   Kennedy was shot June 5, 1968, in the Ambassador Hotel moments
after claiming victory in the California Democratic presidential
primary. He died the following day.
   Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, a native of Jordan, was convicted of the
killing and sentenced to die in the San Quentin gas chamber, but
his death sentence was changed to life imprisonment in 1972 when
the California Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty.
   He is currently imprisoned at Soledad, where he has since been
denied parole numerous times since he first became eligible to
apply for parole in 1975.
   ``The LAPD investigation into the Robert F. Kennedy
assassination by Sirhan Sirhan was exhaustive, yet public concern
about its conclusions remains 20 years later,'' Eu said in a
written statement released by her office. ``In light of that
concern, we believe the public's right know generally outweighs
privacy concerns, and have governed our public release of these
materials with that guideline.''
   The files include reports of investigations of specific
conspiracy theories _ Sirhan has since said he acted alone in
killing Kennedy _ and audio and video tapes from the crime scene.
   The material has been stored in Sacramento since last August,
under an agreement between Los Angeles and the state. The agreement
followed a lengthy effort by scholars and other interested persons
to persuade Los Angeles police officials not to keep the material
secret.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino on Wednesday
shrugged off new threats of violence by the escaped leader of a
1987 coup attempt, but other officials said the military had
readied itself for possible attacks.
   A statement attributed to former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan vowed he would ``act boldly'' after having fled a prison
ship in Manila Bay Saturday. It said Honasan promised last November
``not to engage in hostile acts'' against the Aquino government so
she could make good her promises of political reform. But the
statement said it later became obvious that her administration
imperiled the nation and so, ``We are now withdrawing that
declaration.''
   Mrs. Aquino said, ``I think he will have to admit that the
government had adequately answered already the legitimate
grievances, and I think the Filipino people definitely will go
against Honasan. He will not be able to get support.''
   Honasan had been detained since Dec. 9 for last year's Aug. 28
coup attempt that left 53 people dead and hundreds wounded.
   National Security Adviser Emanuel Soriano dismissed Honasan's
statement as ``just hot air'' but added: ``Of course, we will be in
a situation of watchful waiting.''
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee,
said that while Honasan would ``lie low for a while,'' he would
``eventually move in the direction of taking some action to
destabilize the government.''
   Maceda added, ``However, the armed forces of the Philippines
leadership has already put into action instructions and strategies
to neutralize any effort on the part of Honasan to contact, regroup
or reconsolidate his friends or forces within the military.''
   The 160,000-member armed forces was put on alert and a
nationwide search was mounted for Honasan after he escaped with 14
of his guards. But military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said
troops found no trace of him.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos described the Honasan statement as
``a call to violence'' and said he ordered the military to verify
its authenticity.
   The statement was distributed to news agencies Wednesday.
   Honasan had accused the government of being soft on communist
rebels when he attempted his coup.
   Communist New People's Army rebels meanwhile kidnapped town
mayor Manuel Pandayos and two other officials on Monday in Quirino
in northern Ilocos Sur province, the military said.
   On southern Mindanao island, 20 raiders thought to be Moslem
rebels attacked the American-owned Sibuco Timber Co. in the
mountain village of Camarangan and killed seven workers, the
military said.
   In the central town of Himamaylan on Negros island, five family
members, including three children, were killed Wednesday during
what the military said was a raid on a communist hideout. A
survivor denied that the families had ties to the rebels.

   Guerrillas opened fire on polling
stations during national elections, killing at least three people,
the government radio station reported Wednesday.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said seven other people
were wounded in the attack by opposition forces in the eastern
province of Kunar near the Pakistani border.
   The elections for 62 Senate and 229 National Assembly seats
began on Tuesday and are to run until April 14.
   The radio station earlier said that voting in the eastern
provinces of Kandahar, Bamian, Kunar and Kapisa and the district of
Khost was ``taking place in difficult conditions.''
   It said the opposition had fired on some voting centers in these
areas, which are under the control of communist government forces.
   The Moslem guerrillas claim to control about 80 percent of
Afghanistan, most of it outside the big cities.
   One-fourth of the seats in the Senate and the National Assembly
are being set aside for the rebel candidates even if they do not
participate, the government says.
   The insurgents have not commented officially on the elections,
which are the first since the communists seized power 10 years ago.
Guerrilla officials speaking privately dismissed them as a farce.
   Western diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
have said the vote is meaningless at a time when peace talks are
taking place in Geneva and the Soviet Union is reportedly preparing
to withdraw an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   ``Since the beginning of the elections, extremist opposition
elements have attacked homes and residences with heavy arms. Their
inhuman action was repeated today,'' Radio Kabul said. It said a
number of houses were destroyed, but gave no further details.
   President Najib cast his vote Tuesday, when about 147,300 people
out of the 955,000 registered to vote cast ballots, the radio said.
   The communist party came to power in an April 1978 coup. Soviet
forces intervened in December 1979 to help the faltering government
fight the anti-communist Moslem guerrillas.
   The United States and Pakistan have supported the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Simon Set To Suspend Campaign For Democratic Presidential
Nomination</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX27</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon is expected to suspend his
campaign for the Democratic nomination for president on Thursday
but will remain an official if inactive candidate, his mother
confirmed Wednesday night.
   ``He is not dropping out,'' said Ruth Simon, 83, of
Collinsville, Ill. ``Too many people have advised him to stay in,
and that's what he is going to do.''
   Simon himself has been mum about his plans.
   The Illinois senator said before Tuesday's Wisconsin primary
that he would have to reassess his campaign if he did not do well.
He placed a distant fourth behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore.
   ``He is just suspending his campaign,'' in part because of the
high cost of media advertising, Mrs. Simon told radio station WRYT
in Edwardsville.
   But, she said, ``He's going to hang in there till the end.''
   Mrs. Simon, who said her son called her Tuesday night, said he
planned a week's vacation with his family.
   In Washington on Wednesday, congressional sources speaking on
condition of anonymity said Simon's campaign suspension meant he
would not seek to participate in campaign debates scheduled in New
York before that state's April 19 primary.
   Michael Kreloff, the Simon campaign's Illinois legal counsel,
said Wednesday night that he could not confirm what Simon would say
in a Washington news conference scheduled for Thursday.
   Simon's remaining in the race, even as an inactive candidate,
would allow him to garner more delegates before the Democratic
National Convention in July in Atlanta, and hang on to those he has.
   Under party rules and because of their showings in the March 15
Illinois primary, Simon is entitled to 47 at-large delegates from
Illinois, while Jackson is entitled to 13 and Dukakis none.
   A Simon withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates to
Jackson, who is now behind in the delegate count. Those 47 would be
enough to put him ahead.
   Kreloff said that if Simon suspends active campaigning, instead
of dropping out of the race, it would be understandable.
   ``If, in fact, that's what he does, it would seem to be a
sensible position, given that there is no clear favorite,'' Kreloff
said. ``I think it's the fairest thing to do for Illinois voters
who voted March 15 ... so the delegates reflect what the voters
wanted.''
   While an inactive Simon campaign could block Jackson from
garnering the 47 at-large delegates Simon will get, one Simon
backer said Wednesday she does not think the senator is engaging in
a ``stop-Jackson'' movement.
   ``That's just not Paul Simon,'' said Luellen Laurenti of Normal,
an elected Simon delegate and a member of the Democratic State
Central Committee.
   ``I still think that Paul wants to be ... in a position to have

   A French mediator met with Lebanon's
justice minister Wednesday and said there were signs that French
hostages held in Lebanon would be freed shortly.
   Lucien Bitterlin, a former Gaullist parliament deputy who heads
a pro-Arab lobbying group, talked for an hour with Justice Minister
Nabih Berri, leader of the Syrian-backed Shiite Amal militia.
   ``There are encouraging signals, as I gathered from Minister
Berri, that an adequate solution for the issue of the French
hostages would be achieved shortly,'' Bitterlin told reporters
without elaborating.
   He said the discussions focused on the fate of at least three
Frenchmen held by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad underground faction.
   It was the first time Bitterlin declared publicly he was
involved in efforts to free the hostages. He has made at least
three negotiating trips to Beirut since December.
   The hostages are Marcel Fontaine, 47, vice consul at the French
Embassy in Beirut, Marcel Carton, 64, the embassy's protocol
officer, and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 43.
   Fontaine and Carton were abducted separately on March 22, 1985,
and Kauffmann on May 22 the same year. The kidnappings were claimed
by Islamic Jihad or Holy War, a group of Shiite Moslems loyal to
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Bitterlin had said during previous trips that he was negotiating
the release of eight Europeans seized last year by a radical
Palestinian guerrilla faction headed by Abu Nidal. He said he had
not discussed that case Wednesday with Berri.
   Shiite militants loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the
22 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans. The
longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   President Daniel Ortega warned the
Contra rebels Wednesday that if cease-fire talks break down, the
government will begin a major military offensive.
   ``If the Contras don't accept the agreements, the people must be
ready for combat and ... launch an offensive with all available
force to be rid of (the Contras) once and for all and not prolong
the war,'' he said in remarks carried on the state radio, Voice of
Nicaragua.
   Earlier in the day, the radio reported that Contra and
Sandinista military representatives agreed on seven zones where
rebels will gather during their 60-day cease-fire.
   The two sides remained far apart, however, on key issues to
bring about a permanent peace.
   The Sandinistas launched an offensive against the Contras in
northern Nicaragua last month. On President Reagan's orders, 3,200
U.S. troops flew to Honduras on March 17-18 after Honduran
President Jose Azcona Hoyo said 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers had
invaded his country in pursuit of Contras.
   The U.S. troops never saw action and returned home at the end of
March.
   Wednesday's meeting in the southern border town of Sapoa, the
fourth set of talks in less than a month, dealt with the mechanics
of pursuing the truce which went into effect Friday.
   The Voice of Nicaragua, broadcasting from Sapoa, said boundaries
were set for two zones in the north, two in central Nicaragua, two
on the remote Caribbean coast and one in the south.
   ``Just about all the details were defined about the location and
dimension of the zones, but tomorrow the method of operation will
be discussed,'' Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo, chief of the
Sandinista delegation, said in a broadcast interview after
discussions recessed for the day.
   Cuadra is chief of staff of the Sandinista army.
   The Contras are to gather in the zones during the first 15 days
of April. It still must be decided how to provide security
assurances for the rebels and how humanitarian assistance can be
delivered to them.
   On March 23, the two sides formally agreed to the truce as part
of a plan to end a war that killed or wounded an estimated 50,000
people over nearly seven years.
   Neither the leftist Sandinista government nor the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the U.S.-supported Contra rebel organization, says it
is satisfied with the other side's compliance with the accord.
   Contra leaders accused the Sandinistas of violating a section of
the pact that calls for ``unrestricted freedom of expression'' by
failing to supply newsprint to Nicaragua's only opposition
newspaper, La Prensa.
   At a news conference Wednesday, La Prensa publisher Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro called the newsprint restriction ``a deliberate
blow to freedom of expression in Nicaragua.''
   The accord also called for the release of 100 political
prisoners on March 27. The Contras complain the Sandinistas freed
only 10 of the prisoners the rebels had on their list, although the
pact does not specify the rebels have a say in who goes free.
   Issues still pending include how and when the Contras will lay
down their weapons. This is not spelled out in the plan, nor does
the plan say what will happen to the Contras after they gather in
the zones.
   Under the plan, the government pledges ``that the individuals
who have been reintegrated into normal civilian life will be able
to take part in future elections.''
   But ``normal civilian life'' is open to interpretation in
Nicaragua, where the government claims to have 300,000 people under
arms.
   The Contras backed out of a high-level meeting ``to continue
definitive cease-fire negotiations,'' originally set for Wednesday
in Managua, the capital. They said the meeting must wait until
security issues for the rebels were resolved.
   The two sides are arguing about an agenda for the next meeting,
as well as a date.
   In addition, the Contras insist that their 55-member delegation
stay at Managua's downtown Intercontinental Hotel and be free to
meet with political opposition leaders.
   Maria Teresa Zambrana, head of reservations at the hotel, said
Wednesday the Contras have reserved 50 rooms for April 12-15.
   The Sandinistas have said that for security reasons the Contra
delegation would be housed at a hotel near the airport.

<HEAD>Company Linked To Drug Smuggling Hired To Transport Aid To Contras</HEAD>

   The State Department hired at least one
company linked to earlier drug smuggling to transport aid to the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels in Nicaragua, and was put in touch with
the company by the CIA, according to congressional testimony and
sources.
   The department's Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office in
early 1986 signed a series of contracts totaling more than $300,000
with Vortex, a small Miami air transport and service company, to
airlift ``humanitarian'' aid to the rebels, Michael B. Palmer, an
admitted former drug pilot who then worked for Vortex, said
Wednesday.
   The company was unprepared to handle the volume of supplies the
State Department wanted transported and had to rent a larger
warehouse to accommodate the job, Palmer told the Senate Foreign
Relations narcotics subcommittee.
   Vortex also did airplane maintenance work for CIA proprietary
companies resupplying the Contras in 1987, and in late 1986 sold
the CIA supply operation a DC-6 that formerly had been used to haul
drugs, according to his testimony and committee staff members.
   Investigators for the congressional Iran-Contra committees have
told the narcotics panel that the State Department selected Vortex
from a list of transport companies provided by the CIA, according
to a Senate committee source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``If the Contra delivery system is using known narcotics dealers
(for airlifts), it's no wonder you have confusion surrounding the
policy,'' said subcommittee chairman Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   It was unclear whether the department knew that it was hiring a
company with drug links to undertake part of the resupply
operation. Robert Duemling, who ran the NHAO, was expected to
testify before the panel on Thursday.
   Kerry said the arrangement illustrated ``the absurdity, not to
mention the impropriety, of a government contract going to someone
(with drug involvement), handing out U.S. taxpayer dollars to
support their business.''
   ``Something's wrong here,'' Kerry said. ``A contractor to NHAO,
flying in an ex-drug plane, working simultaneously in narcotics
undercover and supplying goods to the Contras.''
   But Palmer said that was part of the reality of drug enforcement
efforts. He said agencies don't have the money to own their own
aircraft for undercover operations or the desire to undertake such
risky ventures themselves.
   ``Enter sf a $27 million State Department
effort to deliver non-lethal supplies to the Contras, authorized by
Congress in 1985. The General Accounting Office later sharply
criticized the operation, saying large amounts of the aid could not
be accounted for.
   Wednesday's hearing was part of a continuing series of sessions
Kerry said are intended to alert the public and policymakers to the
pervasiveness of drug trading throughout Latin America. Later
witnesses, Kerry said, will establish even stronger links between
drug trafficking and resupply efforts for the Contras.
   Palmer was arrested on marijuana smuggling charges in Michigan
in 1986 along with others, while working for the State Department
and acting at the same time as an informant for the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service. Others charged
at that time were convicted, but Palmer's indictment was dropped
because of his role in helping the government, he testified.
   Palmer said the decision to drop charges against him was made
locally, in Detroit, and was due to circumstances surrounding an
undercover operation, and did not involve Washington higher-ups or
the Contra connection.
   But Kerry said there had been a Washington meeting about
disposition of Palmer's case and that the question of who prompted
his release remained open.

   The hijackers of a Kuwait Airlines jet
released 32 more passengers in Iran early Thursday, but warned that
those remaining would be in danger if authorities failed to meet
the hijackers' demands, Iran's official news agency reported.
   The release left about 50 passengers and crew members aboard the
plane.
   The hijackers warned in a statement that three members of the
Kuwaiti royal family who are still aboard the aircraft would pay a
dear price if the conditions were not fulfilled, the agency
reported.
   The release of the 32 additional passengers came a day after the
hijackers freed 25 hostages _ one ailing man and 24 women.
   The gunmen are demanding the release of 17 Shiite Moslems
convicted and imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies in 1983.
   Deputy Prime Minister Ali Reza Moayyeri told Iranian television
Wednesday that talks on the emergency were under way between
Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry officials who flew to Iran and officials
of the Tehran government.
   The kidnappers, however, accused the Kuwaiti delegation of
wasting its time, and asked the Iranians to mediate between the
hijackers and Kuwaitis, reported Iran's Islamic Republic News
Agency, or IRNA.
   In their statement, the hijackers also warned Iranian security
forces not to take any action against the plane and the hijackers,
IRNA reported.
   The agency quoted the hijackers as saying in a statement that
they wanted the world to realize ``the real nature of the Kuwaiti
rulers who have overlooked all the problems of the Muslim world, at
the top of them the issue of Palestine and the brave Palestinians
who are fighting Israel.''
   The hijackers said they would free any hostage they thought had
nothing to do with the issues involved, IRNA reported, but keep the
others and treat them in such a way as ``to settle our account''
with Kuwait.
   In a conversation with the airport control tower later, the
hijackers said they were considering releasing all non-Kuwaiti
passengers, the agency said.
   Thirty Kuwaitis were on the passenger list.
   IRNA said the 32 people released at 2:30 a.m. Thursday (7 p.m.
Wednesday EDT) included two crew members, a Sudanese and a
Yemenite. All those freed were brought to the transit lounge of
Mashhad airport and were under medical care, it added.
   It added that immediately after the release the hijackers closed
the doors and switched off the lights in the aircraft cabin.
   The hijackers earlier insisted that the Boeing 747 be refueled.
Tehran radio quoted airport authorities at Mashhad in northeastern
Iran as saying they would refuel the plane ``to prevent any
calamity or incident.''
   Food was brought Wednesday to those still aboard the jet.
   IRNA quoted a freed Jordanian passenger as saying there were
five or six hijackers, who wore masks and were armed with pistols
and hand grenades.
   There originally were 112 people on the plane.
   Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah presided at an
emergency meeting of the Kuwaiti Cabinet on Tuesday night and said
the government would not submit to ``blackmail.''
   Relatives have identified the royal prisoners as two sisters in
their early 30s, Ebtesam Khaled Al-Sabah and Anware Khaled
Al-Sabah, and brother Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, described as a
businessman in his 40s.
   In Washington, the State Department praised the sheikdom for
refusing to yield, declaring: ``Kuwait has taken an exemplary
position in the struggle against international terrorism, and we
applaud them for it.''
   Twelve Britons were on the plane before the release early
Thursday. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she would not ask
Kuwait to negotiate, and told reporters: ``We do not give in to
blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies.''
   In Tehran, senior military spokesman Kamal Kharrazi told a news
conference attended by an Associated Press reporter the
``hijackers' identity is still not known to us. We only know that
they speak Arabic and want the prisoners in Kuwait to be freed.''
   Five flight attendants among the women released Wednesday said a
masked man brandishing a pistol announced the hijack in English as
the plane flew over India on Tuesday.
   A physician identified only as Dr. Qassem was sent to the
aircraft Wednesday at the request of the hijackers. IRNA quoted him
as saying he treated two Arabic-speaking women, and the condition
of one was ``not satisfactory.''
   A passenger list released in Bangkok, where Flight 422
originated, indicated the only two women left on the plane were the
members of the royal family.
   The hijackers freed 24 women early Wednesday after 20 hours in
captivity and Jordanian businessman Mustafa Issa, 42, who suffers
from a heart condition, was released Tuesday, IRNA reported.
   Release of the 17 jailed Shiites has been a recurring demand of
Shiite fundamentalist groups, loyal to Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, that are believed to hold most of the 22 Western hostages
in Lebanon.
   Many acts of terrorism in Kuwait have been blamed on Shiite
Moslems acting for Iran, which has been at war with Iraq since
September 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of being its enemy's ally.
   No precise list of the nationalities of the remaining hostages
was available because of differences in lists released by IRNA and
the airline.

   The leftist government, which controls the purchase and sale of
newsprint in Nicaragua, said its supply was exhausted and claimed

   ``La Prensa suspends publication,'' said the banner headline in

   The Ministry of Industry said in a statement in Tuesday morning
papers that it didn't have newsprint because a shipment scheduled

<HEAD>Don't Jump To Conclusions About Low Jobless Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't jump to easy conclusions about those
falling jobless rates. The picture isn't nearly as clear as it has
been made to appear.
   A rush of analyses and a spate of media stories followed the
announcement last week that the civilian unemployment rate had
fallen to 5.6 percent of the labor force, the lowest since May 1979.
   Speculation developed that the economy was overheating, that the
Federal Reserve would be forced into a tougher monetary policy and
even that a shortage of workers might endanger some companies.
   The news isn't that sharply defined, however. Seldom has the job
situation been more complicated, showing signs of both economic
strength and weakness at the same time.
   Evidence of a very strong economy is suggested by this example:
   _ More than 5 million jobs have been created in the past two
years, and expectations for further improvement are showing up in
surveys, such as that conducted quarterly by the National
Association of Independent Business.
   _ This improvement in the numbers has come in spite of hiring
hold-downs by some large corporations, and a serious effort by
major companies to eliminate entire layers of white-collar
bureaucracy.
   But there is another side to the story. Not all the improvement
in the jobless rate can be attributed to economic strength. Much of
what appears to be strength is simply the result of a reduced rate
of labor force expansion.
   The dramatic surge of women into the labor market that took
place in the 1960s and 1970s has abated. In addition, the birth
rate decline in those same decades results in fewer young people
entering the labor force now.
   The slowing of labor force growth, therefore, makes the falling
jobless numbers look better than they are.
   But there are other inconsistencies and oddities, too, and they
create uncertainty about almost any interpretation of jobless
statistics.
   Operators of retail outlets in some areas of the country are
begging for part-time workers, but the outlook for this year's
college graduates isn't as good as it was a couple of years ago.
Employers are said to be more selective.
   Though service industries are big hirers, adding 85,000 jobs in
March alone, in the same month no overall job growth took place in
the nation's factories. In fact, small declines occurred in 11
industries.
   And, in spite of the low and delcining jobless figures, the
number of discouraged workers actually rose in the first quarter.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics now includes one million in that
status, higher than last year.
   Adding to the difficulty of analyzing employment numbers is
still another problem: a big difference in the two surveys _ one a
measure of payrolls, the other a survey of households _ used by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   The business survey found a seasonally adjusted rise of 260,000
in payroll employment from February to March. The household survey
showed a seasonally adjusted decline both in the labor force and
employment.
   What does it mean? The consensus seems to be that the job market
is strong, so strong it could contribute to inflation. A strong
market tends to push up wages. It means the hiring of less
productive workers, also inflationary.
   One of the immediate consequences of that interpretation is talk
around Wall Street that the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates and that, in turn, stock prices could be forced lower.
   Perhaps wiser heads are biding their time, however, knowing that
numbers such as these don't reveal their secrets quickly, but only
over a more extended time.

<HEAD>For Temporary Relief From Tax Pressure, Take Form 4868</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Internal Revenue Service Form 4868 is surely a
popular piece of paper right now.
   For those who have not yet had occasion to use it, 4868 is the
document taxpayers must file by April 15 to get an automatic
extension of the deadline on their federal tax returns.
   Such extensions are in heavy demand this year, with taxpayers
and paid preparers struggling to adjust to the new system that went
into effect in 1987 mandated by tax reform.
   Confusion has been running high about many provisions of the new
code, even among professional veterans of the tax wars.
   Suppose, for example, that you have ``passive losses'' from some
partnership activity. ``The IRS recently released 265 pages of
temporary passive loss regulations, and this is only the
beginning,'' observed the J.K. Lasser Tax Institute in its current
monthly bulletin.
   If you are overwhelmed by tax questions, preoccupied by other
pressing matters or simply in a mood to procrastinate, you can put
off the deadline for completing your return until Aug. 15 by simply
filing Form 4868 now.
   For this extension, unlike any subsequent one you might seek,
the government doesn't require any explanation or excuse. But if
Uncle Sam has any money coming from you, he wants it now, not later.
   The rules require that you include with Form 4868 a check for
the estimated balance of what you still owe, beyond what was
withheld from your wages or salary and any other payments you have
already made.
   The estimate should be made with some care. If it turns out that
you still owe money for 1987 when you file your return on, say,
June 30, the government will charge you interest at a 10 percent
annual rate on the balance due.
   And if what you still owe amounts to more than 10 percent of
your total tax bill for the year, a penalty may also be imposed.
   Although it is a helpful option to have, an extension is not
always an unmixed blessing.
   For one thing, if you have a refund coming, you can't claim it
with Form 4868. That has to wait until your return is filed. And in
the interim the government has what amounts to the free use of the
money.
   That cost may be a small one to pay, however, if an extension
allows you or your professional preparer the breathing space
necessary to make a careful computation of every tax break to which
you are entitled.
   Extensions are also automatically granted, without a Form 4868,
for two months if you can document that you were out of the United
States or Puerto Rico on April 15. But a quick dash across the
border and back will no longer do the trick.
   Nettled by an airline's advertisements touting foreign travel as
a tax dodge, the IRS recently said these extensions apply only to
people who can show that they were out of the country for at least
14 consecutive days, including all of April 15.
   Does an extension in any form increase, or reduce, your chances
of getting audited? Probably not, says the Arthur Young Tax Guide.
   ``Some tax experts contend that you should request the maximum
extension allowed for filing your return, arguing that the chances
of an audit are reduced since IRS field agents will have less time
to conduct the audit,'' the accounting firm says.
   ``Other tax experts contend you're better off filing on April 15
since this way you get lost in the crowd. Both theories are
oversimplifications of IRS procedures.''

<BYLINE>Is Housing Affordability Really Increasing?
^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Encouraged by studies showing housing
affordability has improved, a result of rising incomes and lower
interest rates, many young couples are seeking to buy their first
houses this spring.
   ``Now is as good a time as ever to buy a home,'' says Nestor R.
Weigand, Jr., president of the National Association of Realtors,
because ``conditions over the last few months are the best of the
decade.''
   He points to an affordability reading of 113, meaning a family
earning the median income of $31,384 had 113 percent of the income
needed to qualify for a conventional 80 percent loan on an existing
median-price home of $88,300.
   That's one point of view, and it is well-supported by the
evidence. However, it applies only to those who manage to come up
with the 20 percent down payment, which in some parts of the
country can mean a lot of cash.
   There's another viewpoint: No matter what the affordability
measures say, it is still going to be difficult for most first-time
buyers - those who seek to put down only 10 percent or 15 percent _
to get the house of their choice.
   Those who say that have been observing a growing phenomenon, a
tendency for mortgage lenders to seek higher downpayments from
their customers, thus obliterating the good news coming from
housing and real estate people.
   Because of the surge in housing prices over the past
half-decade, two big obstacles face first-time buyers. First, they
must have sufficient money for the down payment; secondly, they
must be able to afford carrying costs.
   While two incomes help solve the second of these challenges,
these incomes might have very little impact on the problem, that of
amassing the down payment. Young people have a tough time saving,
for reasons well known to everybody.
   Recognizing this, the market responded with extremely low down
payments, made possible in part by mortgage insurance that reduced
the lender's risk. As a result, many buyers were able to get by
with 10 percent down, or even less.
   As it turns out, however, what was good for the homebuyer was
not always so for the private mortgage insurance industry. Real
estate prices have actually fallen in some areas, eroding the
owner's tiny equity.
   In some instances, owners of houses with insured mortgages have
found when they sold that they had insufficient money to pay off
the mortgage. That being so, some mortgage companies have
experienced a surge of claims.
   The response of such insurers is to seek customers who make
larger initial payments. And, with prices in many communities
double or triple the national median, that can mean a sum beyond
the abilities of most young couples.
   The insistence by lenders that buyers obtain mortgage insurance,
and the insistance by mortgage insurers that the buyer make a
larger down payment, tends to offset the impact of lower interest
rates and a variety of mortgages.
   It leaves the first-time homebuyer in a tough spot, which is
nothing new, as the statistics show.
   In 1986, according to the Realtors, the home ownership rate fell
to 63.8 percent from 65.6 percent in 1980. For those in the prime
homebuying ages of 25 to 43 years, the descent was sharper, to 45.4
percent from 55 percent.
   Sympathy for young couples isn't universal, however.
   Raymond Roehrick, 75, of Hixson, Tenn., offers a comment typical
for many members of his generation:
   ``When we got married in 1937 no young married could buy a home
_ only those over 50 owned them, as now. The young marrieds had to
save for 15 years just for a down payment.
   ``All over the country homes by the Federal Housing
Administration and others for $15,000 up are going begging for
owners, because young people don't have the guts to start at the
bottom, buy a shack, fix it up and sell it.''

<HEAD>Mainline Denomination Abandoning Pro-Choice Abortion Stand</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mainline American denomination, the American
Baptist Churches, is backing away from its support of abortion
rights, officials indicated this week.
   It was the first such definitive shift projected among the
larger, socially activist Protestant bodies.
   Similar reassessments have come in some other major
denominations, either stiffening opposition to abortion, or
qualifying acceptance of it. But some still take an essentially
pro-choice position.
   The turn away from it planned by American Baptists stemmed both
from simmering discontent with the past stance and the swelling
tide of abortions in the country.
   ``The great proliferation of abortion has made us stop and look
at what's happening here,'' says Gloria Marshall of Alto Loma,
Calif., head of a task force which has been re-examining the issue
for more than two years.
   ``It's a process of reevaluation and reassessment,'' she said in
a telephone interview. ``This is a continuing necessity if the
church is to carry out its prophetic role on such a key social
issue.''
   She said positions can't be fixed ``in concrete,'' but ``are
pulled along by social changes on the issue and as we understand
more about it.'' She termed the projected new stand
``responsibility to choose life.''
   It attempts a path-breaking middle ground.
   ``It is a pro-life stance in affirming the sacredness of life as
a gift of God,'' she said. But it avoids both the ``pro-life'' and
``pro-choice'' terms commonly used in the polarized conflict over
abortion.
   Mrs. Marshall, a former missionary in Zaire and wife of a
minister, said: ``We've sought a different vocabulary for dealing
with a very complex subject. We've tried to find a common ground
for ministering to people about it.''
   The newly prepared statement, expected to be approved in a final
presentation to a policy-making general board in June, acknowledges
keen diversity among the denomination's 1.6 million members on the
issue.
   Howevever, the statement breaks with the previous 1981 stand,
which saw abortion in terms of religious liberty as a ``matter of
responsible personal choice.''
   The new document, recognizing ``life as a sacred and gracious
gift of God,'' says:
   ``As American Baptists we oppose abortion, as a means of
avoiding responsibility for conception, as a primary means of birth
control, without regard for the far-reaching consequences of the
act.
   ``We denounce irresponsible sexual behavior and acts of sexual
violence that contribute to the large number of abortions each year.
   ``We grieve with all who struggle with the difficult
circumstances that lead them to consider abortion. Recognizing that
each person is ultimately responsible to God, we encourage women
and men in these circumstances to seek spiritual counsel as they
prayerfully and conscientiously consider their decision.''
   A sister church, the larger 14.6-million Southern Baptist
Convention, takes a firmly anti-abortion position, toughening that
stand in 1984 to ask for laws prohibiting all abortion except to
``save the physical life of the mother.''
   Changes also have come among more liberal mainline bodies,
including:
   The Presbyterian Church (USA) in 1985 qualified its acceptance
of choice in the matter, opposing abortion ``as a method of birth
control'' or for ``convenience or to ease embarrassment.''
   The Church of the Brethren in 1984 explicitly condemned
abortion, after previously taking a more pastoral view of it.
   The former Lutheran Church in America, now merged into the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, in 1980 sharpened its
rejection of abortion, saying it destroys life, and urged laws
protecting it ``from conception to birth.''
   Numerous denominations have steadily rejected abortion,
including Eastern Orthodox churches, Roman Catholicism, the
Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, Mormons and conservative
evangelical denominations.
   However, several mainline bodies, such as the United Methodist
Church, Episcopal Church, United Church of Christ and Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ), uphold choice about abortion, and the
legalizing of it.
   The seven-member American Baptist task force, including three
supporters of legalized abortion, three opponents and one
undetermined about it, has held hearings across the country,
gathered questionaires and a flood of letters.
   Mary Mild, staff assistant on the project at the denomination's
headquarters in Valley Forge, Pa., said there has been some
discontent with the previous stance of 1981. ``Enough people were
not happy'' with it as ``reflecting where we really are,'' she said.
   The revision expresses no opinion of the 1973 Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion, neither for nor against, but condemns
harassing either abortion clinics or doctors refusing to do
abortions.
   The seven-page statement stresses education and ministry to
reinforce responsible sexuality, to help those facing problem
pregnancies and to provide needed financial aid to women carrying
such pregnancies to birth.
   While not citing any circumstances that justify abortion, as was
done previously, the new statement urges a ministry of ``love and
spiritual counsel to those who choose to terminate their
pregnancies.''

   Jaime Escalante focuses on the
blackboard with absorbed frustration. Reporters and photographers
have invaded his classroom, and he's concerned his students are
losing their concentration.
   Although his life and unorthodox teaching methods are the
subject of the critically acclaimed film ``Stand and Deliver,''
Escalante has more important things on his mind _ like mathematics
and helping his James Garfield High School students to learn as
much as they can.
   ``We have so many people working at Jack in the Box (fast-food
restaurants) and pumping gas,'' he said. Like the movie teacher
portrayed by actor Edward James Olmos, Escalante wants more for his
students, and pushes them to excel in math and use it as their
ticket out of menial jobs.
   ``It's like a sport,'' he said. ``You have to practice every day
to be in shape.''
   His scrapbooks chronicle the victories of his mathematical
athletes. Photos show beaming students holding banners heralding
their achievements.
   Each year the number of Escalante students passing the Advanced
Placement calculus test, given by the Educational Testing Service
for college credit, has grown tremendously.
   In 1979, five students took the test and all had a passing mark
of 3 or better. By last year, 87 Garfield students passed the test,
higher than any other school in Southern California.
   The movie concerns an incident in 1982, when 18 students took
the exam and all passed. Surprised that the predominantly Hispanic
class had performed so well in a school that was about to lose its
academic accreditation, the ETS accused the students of cheating.
   Twelve took the retest and passed with either perfect scores of
5 or near perfect scores of 4.
   Last year, scores made by Garfield students taking the Advanced
Placement calculus test placed Garfield second in the nation out of
the 4,197 schools with students taking the tough exam, said Janice
Gams with the Educational Testing Service.
   Just 2 percent of American students even attempt the test.
   This year, a record 160 Garfield students are expected to take
the test, and Escalante has set his sights on attracting even more
students to calculus classes in the 10 more years he plans to
continue teaching.
   ``He's your friend, he's your mentor and he's your father,''
said former student Josie Richkarday, who was one of the 18
students suspected of cheating.
   ``He just didn't teach,'' said Richkarday, 23, who is studying
to be a math teacher herself. ``He brought something out of me. If
you're willing to go 50 yards, he'll go 100.''
   Escalante has seen ``Stand and Deliver'' four times and likes
it, although he says 90 percent is true and 10 percent is hype
because the Warner Bros. release depicts more gang activity than
really exists and portrays the families and neighborhoods as more
destitute than they really are.
   His students have become doctors and engineers. They work at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which does work for NASA, and for TRW
Inc., and Atlantic Richfield Co.
   Dr. Armando Islas, a 1976 Garfield graduate and an oral surgeon
with two offices in the Los Angeles area, credits Escalante with
challenging him to be more than a C student with athletic talent.
   ``He was a fantastic instructor,'' Islas said. ``He kept you
motivated, and his method of teaching was kind of unorthodox but I
think in that particular environment that's what you needed.''
   In the 14 years Escalante has been at Garfield, he has watched
the gang influence dissipate, due mostly to a tough line by school
administrators and teachers. The graffiti is more or less gone.
And, thanks in part to the reputation of Escalante's math
achievers, the school is respected within the mostly Hispanic
barrio, where neatly kept stucco homes reflect community pride.
   The days when students didn't want to go to Garfield are over,
said Principal Maria Tostado, who grew up in the area.
   ``There's no longer the defeatist attitude that no matter what
you do you're not going to get ahead,'' she said. Today, the school
is well-known for academic prowess.
   Escalante, a 57-year-old father of two sons, was a respected
teacher in Bolivia for 11 years before coming to the United States
at his wife's urging in 1964. Once here, he tried a career in
computers but the work lacked the spirit of teaching.
   ``I got real tired,'' he said in an interview. ``I didn't want
to deal anymore with the printouts or schematics.''
   Now he spends his days in a stage-like arena before as many as
52 students who sit on tiered rows, and demands that late comers
get ``The Chair,'' a tot's seat meant to embarrass tardy students
into promptness.
   His classroom is plastered with posters designed to motivate. A
foot-high banner curls around the room's corners, greeting students
with: ``Calculus need not be made easy; it is easy already.''
   Another poster tells students what they can expect to feel if
they master math: ``Feel ready to attend any college or university.
Feel prepared to go into real estate, business, engineering. Feel
really good about myself.''
   The students do feel good about themselves. Boredom is replaced
with laughter, smiles and friendly jests, as Escalante tries to
reach them through cheers, swats them with a battered and faded
pillow, practices an imaginary ski swish and does practically
anything to promote learning.
   He was given the nickname ``Kimo Sabe'' by four gang toughs in
his class. The name translates loosely from Spanish as ``the one
who knows.'' He's accepted the nickname, but shakes off such
glorious titles as ``American hero,'' which Newsweek dubbed him in
a recent story about the movie and teacher behind it.
   ``What I tried to do is improve things in my school,'' he said.
   ``He's a master,'' said Tostado, describing Escalante's
teaching. ``He's a genius at it.''
   News crews file in and out of his classroom almost daily now,
but while the media intrusion disturbs him, Escalante believes the
rewards from the movie's exposure will offset the Hollywood glare.
   ``It's going to motivate parents to control, to help ... because
the schools alone cannot educate,'' he said. ``It's going to
motivate the students. The teachers are going to see it's better to
teach the way this guy does and and not from the desk.''

<HEAD>``Miami Vice'' Star Goes Home to Make Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NORTH MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The working class neighborhood
that taught Edward James Olmos respect for humanity and watched the
``Miami Vice'' star mature into an acclaimed actor is home to his
latest movie.
   Olmos returned to an East Los Angeles high school last spring to
make ``Stand and Deliver,'' a movie about a magnetic, demanding
math teacher who led an unruly Hispanic class to academic triumph
in 1982.
   The 41-year-old actor was no stranger to the halls of Garfield
High School. His cousin teaches computer science there. Only 1{
miles from his childhood home, it is ethnically mixed, like the
neighborhood he remembers.
   ``Stand and Deliver'' was a smash when it opened in Los Angeles.
It brought in $411,000 during its first week last month, averaging
$14,000 at each of 30 theaters, he said.
   Olmos, an actor of Mexican-American heritage who won an Emmy
Award for his role as Lt. Castillo on the NBC-TV series ``Miami
Vice,'' was delighted with the movie and its reception in his home
area.
   ``This film is probably the most inspirational film I've done to
date,'' he said of the Warner Bros. release.
   ``Stand and Deliver'' is about overcoming racial stigmas. It
advances the humanities, something Olmos said he holds close to his
heart; something he learned in a family of eight living in a
neighborhood crowded with Russian, Mexican, Jewish and American
Indian families.
   Olmos, who co-produced and helped write the movie, claims he is
not making a political point.
   ``I'm not a political animal,'' he said. It's the advancement of
the humanities through acting that inspires Olmos.
   ``It's always been that way. It serves me well and makes me
stronger,'' he said.
   ``That doesn't mean I have to make message movies. I think that
art forms, especially films, should be used to entertain. Now if by
chance your entertaining and allowing (your audience) to experience
an event that has some value and some substance and some awareness
to it, well even better.
   ``The criterion, No. 1, is the story. If that story happens to
be socially relevant, well that's wonderful, but if it isn't,
that's OK too.''
   ``Stand and Deliver'' is about an event that drew national
attention to Garfield High School's 1982 calculus class. The
predominantly Hispanic class took and passed an Advance Placement
calculus test, in stark contrast to the rest of the school, which
faced loss of accreditation.
   The 18 students, who were badgered and inspired by computer
specialist-turned-teacher Jaime Escalante, were stripped of their
honors when the Educational Testing Service, which tests U.S.
students and provides their scores to colleges and universities,
accused the entire class of cheating.
   In the movie, Olmos, in his role as Escalante, accuses the
Educational Testing Service of racism. Students from wealthy
Beverly Hills would not be questioned if they passed an Advance
Placement calculus test, but students with Hispanic names from a
barrio high school were suspect, he says in the movie.
   Eventually, the students are vindicated with a second test.
   The movie is not meant to be manipulative, Olmos said. It
presents an event ``that allows you to experience with your own
values.''
   ``We don't give results,'' he said. ``We only give the facts.''

<HEAD>Bonneville SSE An Impressive Road Car</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>

   The 1988 Pontiac Bonneville SSE is more than a
technology buff's dream come true.
   It's an impressive road car and comfortable large sedan that
even a techno-phobe can appreciate.
   Inside the aerodynamically styled vehicle, a driver can tune the
radio without taking his hands off the steering wheel. The radio
buttons are built into the wheel, around the horn. An electronic
compass senses the earth's magnetic field. Thus, changes in the
SSE's direction are continuously displayed on an electronic map on
the dashboard.
   And a new, smooth, fuel-injected 3800 V6, wonderfully firm
suspension, Goodyear Eagle GT+4 radial tires and antilock brakes
join to provide stable road handling and enjoyable ride.
   Yes, the SSE is a car to show off to friends and neighbors. But
it doesn't come cheaply. Base price is $21,879.
   You get what you pay for: The SSE is so loaded with standard
equipment there are only three options (alarm system, interior
leather and power sunroof).
   Additionally, the SSE is priced below many of its foreign
competitors, such as the Audi 5000, which starts at more than
$22,000, and Volvo 760, which starts around $31,200.
   New for the 1988 model year, the SSE is the top of the
Bonneville line which was redesigned inside and out for the 1987
model year.
   The lowest-priced Bonneville, the LE, has a base price of
$14,099 and nearly the same stylish exterior as the SSE but without
the fancy handling package and technology frills.
   There's also a middle offering _ the Bonneville SE that starts
at $16,299 and shares the new 3.8-liter V6 with the SSE but not the
same suspension.
   Pontiac, a division of General Motors Corp., expects to build
only 14,000 Bonneville SSEs this model year, and spokesman Reginald
Harris says, ``We expect to sell them all with no problem. The
initial reception to the car has been great, exceeding our
forecast.''
   Pontiac projects total Bonneville sales this model year of
110,000, up from 93,575 in the 1987 model year, he added.
Bonnevilles rank third in volume at Pontiac, behind the Grand Am
and Pontiac 6000 models.
   The majority of buyers targeted for the 1988 Bonnevilles are
male and married, Pontiac says. Average age is 49 for the LE and 45
for the SSE. The division looks for 44 percent of the LE buyers and
64 percent of the SSE buyers to be college graduates.
   Average household income of targeted buyers is $41,000 for the
LE and $61,000 for the SSE. Many of these (SSE) buyers are
intenders of high-level imports who previously haven't had a
domestic choice, the division said. They're attracted to very
expressive styling and are very discriminating in quality and
function of features.
   The test Bonneville SSE was fun, though there were a few
glitches. At night, the dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree
because of all the electronics and buttons, including those for
automatic heat and air conditioning.
   However, one of the buttons for setting interior temperature
sometimes stuck.
   An electronic screen on the dashboard indicated when the next
oil change, tire rotation and tune-up were needed and monitored
doors and the trunk to make sure they were secured.
   But I drove 5 miles with the trunk ajar, and no warning appeared
on the screen.
   The 10-way, adjustable front bucket seats were roomy and had
countless comfortable settings, including three buttons for power
lumbar support at three different spots in the back of the seats.
   But the power headrests were bulkier than I was used to and I
found myself craning to look around them when backing up.
   Still, the trunk was flat and spacious, and the Delco sound
system was superb.
   There was comfortable seating in the rear, and a rear arm
rest-console provided a spot for beverages and storage if only two
people rode back there.
   However, because the model is so new, Consumer Reports does not
yet have repair records.

of Texaco's bankruptcy reorganization plan, restating objections
already rejected by the judge.
   The plan still will take effect on schedule Thursday unless
Icahn also persuades the bankruptcy court judge to halt the
process, which will include $5.6 billion in payments to the oil

   The richest 1 percent of Americans paid more
than one-fourth of all individual income taxes in 1986, due in
large part to an extraordinary increase in investment income, the
Treasury Department said.
   The portion of taxes paid by those with incomes of less than
$50,000 a year dropped from 66.8 percent in 1981, before enactment
of across-the-board tax cuts, to 45.7 percent in 1986, the
department said Tuesday.
   During the same period, the share borne by those making over
$100,000 more than doubled, from 15.2 percent of the total to 30.6

   Interest rates are not headed skyward despite a
slight uptick in recent weeks, economists say.
   Interest rates rise when lenders become fearful of inflation,
but so far inflation remains under control in spite of surprisingly
strong economic growth, a number of economists interviewed Tuesday
said.
   Consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of between 4
percent and 4.5 percent, roughly the same as they have for the past
three years. And that has allowed Americans to enjoy a rare
combination of fairly robust growth and slowly rising prices.

Nabisco cookie ads for 12 years and Life Saver candy ads for 18

   Oil futures prices have skidded below the
$17-a-barrel range following a Kuwaiti news report that OPEC's
pricing committee would not recommend a full ministerial conference
of the cartel at its April 9 meeting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May delivery price of
West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 22 cents per barrel to
$16.79 on Tuesday. Most of the drop came in the afternoon, but
volume was relatively light.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale No. 2
heating oil fell 0.80 cent a gallon to 45.20 cents, and unleaded
gasoline fell 0.71 cent a gallon to 48.64 cents.
   The oil market has been focusing on Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' price and production policies because of a
persistent output glut and widespread reports of cheating among the
cartel's 13 members on their self-imposed production limits.
   The April 9 meeting in Vienna had incited some hope that OPEC
would act aggressively to stabilize prices and enforce production
discipline to limit excessive supplies. Traders said the Kuwaiti
news report dampened the optimism and forced a selloff in the
futures market.
   But they said the light volume of trading suggested most oil
market participants are reluctant to buy or sell pending the
outcome of the price committee meeting.
   The committee has no power to alter OPEC policy but it can call
for a full ministerial meeting, considered its strongest option.

   Reed Funk's grass has shimmered in the Rose
Bowl, in Yankee Stadium, on the Masters golf course and across
thousands of private lawns.
   He's got a famous touch with turf, but the 59-year-old
researcher and academician says the grass is always greener
somewhere else.
   ``You start out with a variety and then immediately start
working on a replacement that's better, because nothing is
perfect,'' he said.
   Colleagues and others involved in the turf industry say Funk has
taken an unknown field and made it his own, revolutionizing the
development of grass and gaining international prominence in the
process.
   A Rutgers University researcher and turf science professor, Funk
has been developing scores of grass varieties for more than 20
years. In his New Brunswick offices and on 200 acres of test fields
in Adelphia, Funk combines various strains of grass seed in search
of the best combination.
   Funk has created fine-textured turf grasses, lush dark green
grasses, shade and drought-tolerant grasses, and grasses that repel
disease and insects, bearing such names as Rebel, Gator and Prelude.
   ``He is often referred to as the Albert Einstein of the seed
industry,'' said John Morrissey, executive vice president of Lofts
Seed Inc. of Bound Brook. ``There is nobody, probably in the world,
who is as knowledgeable on new varieties in the turf grass
industry.''
   Morrissey, who has done business with and consulted Funk for
about 20 years, said Funk's students are courted heavily by the
grass seed industry because of his track record.
   Funk's work and the work of students and faculty in the Cook
College soils and crops department at Rutgers have kept hundreds of
thousands of dollars in royalties flowing into the university's
turf research department.
   ``He's one of these fellows who's intelligent and he works
efficiently,'' said Ralph Engel, who retired two years ago after
serving as a long-time professor of turf science at Rutgers.
   ``He works lots of hours and he's put it all together,'' said
Engel, a 25-year associate of Funk.
   When the golf world's luminaries descend on the Augusta National
course in Georgia for the Masters Tournament on Thursday, they will
tread a course seeded partly with Funk's Palmer strain, named after
golf legend Arnold Palmer. The strain carpets many courses
throughout the Northeast, Funk says.
   Funk's Adelphi bluegrass, a hybrid of Kentucky bluegrass, long
has been used by groundskeepers at Shea Stadium in Flushing, N.Y.,
said stadium manager John McCarthy.
   ``It's a sturdy grass and ideal for the temperature of New
York,'' McCarthy said.
   Funk gravitated to turf research after an early life dominated
by agriculture. He was raised on a 600-acre dairy farm in Richmond,
Utah, and earned undergraduate and master's degrees in agronomy
from Utah State University.
   After earning his doctorate from Rutgers in 1961, Funk narrowly
missed getting an appointment to research sugarcane growth in
Hawaii. But the miss freed him to become Rutgers' first full-time
scientist working with turf grasses.
   He said his first creation to achieve widescale popularity was
the Manhattan perennial rye grass in 1967, which was considered a
marked improvement over other rye grasses. Funk said that grass
still is used in European soccer stadiums.
   This spring, Funk's Pinnacle grass _ which is resistant to a
number of insects _ should start cropping up on lawns, parks and
cemeteries in the Northeast.
   Over the past 20 years, Funk has become highly regarded for his
ability to adapt grasses to the needs of different climates and
situations, said Morrissey, of Lofts Seeds.
   But Funk's colleagues say he never is satisfied, and they
repeatedly are disarmed by his humility despite his grand
reputation and stellar credentials.
   ``He's the first one we've looked to,'' said Morrissey. ``The
great leader is Funk, who has developed probably more proprietary
turf types than any one in the world.''

   Interest rates have edged higher in recent
weeks, but most economists see no cause for alarm because there is
little evidence that the driving force of the rise is higher
inflation.
   Inflation remains under control in spite of surprisingly strong
economic growth, economists say.
   ``There is a lot of skepticism about inflation. I think it's
healthy but probably unwarranted,'' Thomas F. Carpenter, vice
president and economics director for ASB Capital Management, a
Washington-based pension fund manager, said Tuesday.
   Consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of about 4 percent
to 4.5 percent, roughly the same as in the past three years.
   The concern about inflation is a sharp contrast to opinions that
prevailed after the Oct. 19 stock market crash. Then, interest
rates fell because investors felt the crash might trigger a
recession and curb inflation.
   Rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell from about 11.6
percent just before the stock market crash last October to a little
over 9.8 percent by February, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac.
   Instead of crashing, though, the economy has created more than 1
million jobs since October. The jobless rate fell to 5.6 percent in
March, the lowest in nine years.
   Some investors changed their minds and decided the economy was
in danger of overheating and high inflation. Mortgage rates
consequently have crept back to just over 10 percent nationwide as
of April 1, Freddie Mac says.
   Inflation fears drive up interest rates because investors demand
higher yields to make up for the erosion of the value of
fixed-income investments that inflation causes.
   Americans are paying unusually high interest rates now because
credit-market investors were burned by double-digit inflation in
the 1970s and early 1980s and keep thinking those days might come
again.
   Despite the fears of last October, many economists now have
concluded the stock market crash was good for the economy because
it cooled off an economy that was overheating.
   Steep recessions generally are preceded by inflationary
overheating, which leads to high interest rates that in turn choke
off economic growth.
   In the current economy, inflation hasn't had a chance to
accelerate because the credit markets have reacted so quickly to
it, driving up interest rates and cooling the economy before it
overheats, said Alan Lerner, a managing director and financial
economist for Bankers Trust Co.
   In a sense, Lerner said, the economy has become self-correcting
through the bond market's sensitivity to inflation. That may
explain why the economy remains in the longest peacetime expansion
of the 20th century.
   ``The bond market is running the economic show both globally and
domestically,'' Carpenter said. ``Bond managers, in effect, are in
the driver's seat.''
   Some economists believe the Federal Reserve, the nation's
central bank, has engineered the recent uptick in interest rates.
   According to that theory, the Fed is trying to prove its
inflation-fighting credentials to the bond market. It is heading
off a steep rise in interest rates over the long term by pushing
them up slightly in the short term.
   ``The Federal Reserve reaction is appropriate,'' said George
Gols, an analyst for Arthur D. Little Inc. in Boston. ``To prepare
for inflationary surges is much better than to do it afterward.''
   But other economists say Fed action, if any, has been modest.
   One reason might be that any attempt by the Fed to cool off the
economy with higher interest rates would punish the housing market,
which is relatively weak.
   If the Fed is doing anything, ``They're just raising the flag
and saying, `Hey, we're here. We're not oblivious to what's going
on in the world,''' said Robert Chandross, chief economist in the
North American head office of Lloyds Bank of London.
   The yield of the widely watched 30-year Treasury bond has ticked
up to about 8.9 percent this week from a recent low of less than
8.3 percent in early February.
   Carpenter said the bond probably would go no higher than 9.3
percent and no lower than 8.3 percent in the rest of 1988. Lerner
said it might edge up to 9.5 or even 9.7 percent by the end of the
year. Gols, who is in a small minority of economists predicting a
recession by the end of 1988, predicted the long bond's yield would
rise slightly and then trend steadily downward.

   Four days after he won his fight for Federated
Department Stores Inc., Robert Campeau was looking to expand the
retailer's top performers while cutting costs throughout the
company.
   The chairman of Campeau Corp. said Tuesday that Federated's
Bloomingdale's division, which now has 17 stores, potentially could
be a national chain and said he was considering opening branches in
Canada as well.
   But, Campeau told a news conference, expansion would come second
to cost-cutting and productivity.
   ``Our emphasis in the future is to raise the sales per square
foot,'' Campeau said.
   Campeau and Robert Morosky, the president of Campeau's Allied
Stores unit, said they would review each of Federated's divisions
to see where improvements could be made, and did not rule out
layoffs.
   ``There will be some streamlining,'' Campeau said. ``You cannot
survive and compete by having jobs and jobs and jobs.''
   ``That doesn't mean we will be laying off en masse,'' he said.
``We do want to expand.''
   Federated, the nation's fifth largest retailer, agreed Friday to
be taken over by Campeau, a Toronto-based developer, in a $6.58
billion buyout. The agreement ended a 2-month-long battle that
included a bidding war between Campeau and R.H. Macy & Co. Inc.
   Campeau said his company planned to retain Federated's Ralphs
supermarkets division in California. The 127-store chain was among
the divisions Campeau had been expected to sell when it began its
tender offer.
   Campeau said Ralphs would be sold into a wholly owned Campeau
Corp. subsidiary, with the proceeds of the sale used to help pay
for the Federated acquisition.
   Morosky reiterated that Campeau planned to retain six Federated
department store divisions: Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus,
Rich's, Burdine's, Goldsmith's and Lazarus. But some stores in
those divisions may be shut, Morosky said.
   ``Maybe they're better off as real estate locations,'' he said.
He declined to say which stores might be targeted for closing.
   Campeau was expected to deal with Federated as he did Allied
after it was acquired in 1986, by paring its unprofitable stores.
   Campeau already has agreed to sell four of Federated's
department store divisions, and expects to sell its Gold Circle
discount stores and its specialty store operations as well. Morosky
said Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Gold Circle's management have
expressed interest in the 76-store chain.
   Campeau refused to discuss a meeting he held with Macy Chairman
Edward Finkelstein last Thursday during which their takeover fight
was resolved, but described Finkelstein as ``relieved,'' and
himself as ``delighted.''
   Campeau said the takeover will cost his company a total of $8.8
billion, including the price of Federated shares, refinancing of
debt and expenses. He said he expected earnings of $375 million to
$400 million from the combined operations of Allied and Federated,
based on the companies' 1987 sales.
   He said he did not expect to use junk-bond financing in the
Federated acquisition except in the Ralphs transaction.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Order in Lord Geller Breakaway Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The combatants in the legal dispute over a
top-level walkout from the Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein
advertising agency each say they are pleased by a New York state
judge's first ruling in the case.
   Justice Herman Cahn of the New York Supreme Court issued a
preliminary injunction Tuesday prohibiting the executives who left
Lord Geller from soliciting Lord Geller employees to work for their
new firm.
   He also enjoined two top defectors, Richard Lord and Arthur
Einstein Jr., from ``soliciting or accepting, directly or
indirectly'' any of Lord Geller's current clients.
   But the judge refused to prohibit the new agency from using the
name ``Lord'' in its title. The defectors have called their new
agency Lord, Einstein, O'Neill & Partners.
   A spokesman for the Lord Geller agency, James Fingeroth, said
the agency was ``very pleased'' by the ruling and felt that
securing a preliminary injunction against some types of activity
was a significant step in its favor.
   Lord Einstein said in a statement that the ruling ``paves the
way for Lord Einstein to devote its full energies to service the
needs of its clients.''
   Thomas Schwarz, attorney for Lord Einstein, said Lord and
Einstein never intended to solicit Lord Geller clients. He also
said the ruling leaves the agency free to hire any Lord Geller
employees who may apply on their own.
   The ruling came in a suit filed by Lord Geller's parent, WPP
Group PLC, accusing the departing executives of breaching their
fiduciary duties in leaving the firm and conspiring to take away
Lord Geller's business.
   Six top executives walked off the job at Lord Geller on March
18, saying they felt unduly constrained under WPP's management.
   Lord Geller was part of JWT Group Inc., which the British firm
WPP acquired for $566 million in July 1987 in the biggest ad
industry takeover to date.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco Fires Saatchi & Saatchi, Citing Philosophical
Differences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc. has
fired a longtime advertising agency, and one source familiar with
the decision said it reflected RJR's displeasure over the agency's
no-smoking ads for another client.
   RJR cited recent philosophical differences Tuesday for its
decision to dismiss the ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Inc., and
declined to elaborate.
   But a source familiar with the decision said RJR was displeased
at the ads Saatchi recently developed to tout Northwest Airlines'
new no-smoking program.
   Industry sources estimate the agency was handling as much as
$100 million in ad billings for RJR Nabisco candy, cookies and
chewing gum, making it a major account by ad industry standards.
   In announcing the dismissal in a statement from Atlanta, the
company said, ``It is important as RJR Nabisco Inc. shapes and
executes its marketing and sales objectives it deals with
advertising agencies that have a wholly-consistent philosophical
approach to its plans and programs.''
   ``During this important period, philosophical differences have
developed between RJR Nabisco Inc. and one of its agencies, Saatchi
& Saatchi DFS Inc.,'' the statement said. As a result, RJR said it
had ``elected to conclude its relationship'' with Saatchi, the
successor to agencies that have created ads for Life Savers candy
for 18 years and various Nabisco cookies for 12 years.
   RJR executives refused to elaborate on the statement, or to
comment on the suggestion that it was unhappy with Saatchi's
no-smoking ads for Northwest.
   Saatchi said it was ``very saddened and disappointed'' at RJR's
action, but its executives also declined to comment on what may
have led to the decision.
   But one source familiar with the events, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the company was unhappy with Saatchi's ads for
Northwest, which announced plans two weeks ago to ban smoking on
most of its North American flights starting April 23.
   The airline has promoted the plan heavily in print and broadcast
ads. The plan goes farther than required by government regulations,
which ban smoking on flights of less than two hours starting later
this month.
   In one television commercial announcing the plans, a lone smoker
is shown puffing on a cigarette on an airplane.
   As the camera pans back up the aisle, a narrator announces
Northwest's plans to offer ``a smoke-free environment'' on all of
its North American flights. The other passengers stand up and
applaud.
   ``Upset is too mild a term,'' the source said when asked to
describe RJR's reaction to Saatchi's work for Northwest.
   The New York Times quoted an RJR Nabisco employee, who asked not
to be identified, in today's editions as saying the company did
take away Saatchi's assignments because of the Northwest ads, but
mainly because the company had not been told of them in advance.
   Ironically, Saatchi & Saatchi DFS' New York unit, Saatchi &
Saatchi DFS Compton, does no cigarette advertising for RJR Nabisco,
whose R.J. Reynolds Tobacco unit markets Camel, Winston, Salem and
Vantage cigarettes.
   Saatchi does create advertising for True cigarettes, which are
made by Loews Corp.'s Lorillard division, an RJR competitor.
   Saatchi's assignments for RJR Nabisco include Life Savers Roll
Candy, Care Free Sugarless Chewing Gum and Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and
Almost Home cookies.
   Saatchi & Saatchi DFS's U.S. billings amount to about $1.6
billion, according to the trade journal Advertising Age. It is a
unit of London-based Saatchi & Saatchi PLC, the biggest ad holding
company in the world.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Sides With Koppers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court in California has
upheld a victory for Koppers Co. in its fight against a $1.7
billion hostile takeover attempt by British industrialist Brian C.
Beazer and the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Separately, Koppers said its board of directors decided it could
not take a position on the outstanding hostile bid by the Beazer
group because of the court ruling, other outstanding litigation and
Koppers ongoing attempts to seek alternative courses of action.
   U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judges Alfred T. Goodwin and
Harry Pregerson late Tuesday denied the Beazer group's appeal of a
lower court order issued Monday that blocked its $60 a share
hostile tender offer.
   The one-sentence ruling was announced from the appeal court's
headquarters in San Francisco.
   U.S. District Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles issued a
preliminary injunction suspending the tender offer indefinitely
because of on antitrust questions. He issued the order after
Koppers argued that competition could be weakened in the local
market for sand, gravel and hard stone for construction if
California properties of Beazer and Koppers were combined.
   Attorneys for the Beazer group had argued that a delay in
closing the tender offer could jeopardize financing for the
takeover.
   Koppers shares declined $1 to $56.25 a share Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   In Pittsburgh, Beazer met Tuesday with Koppers Chairman Charles
R. Pullin, neither ``was prepared to discuss much of mutual
interest at that meeting,'' Koppers stated in a news release.
   Pullin requested the meeting, according to Beazer spokeswoman
Lissa Perlman in New York. But Pullin was not prepared to discuss
the hostile tender offer or Beazer's proposal to negotiate a
friendly merger with the Pittsburgh construction materials and
chemicals company, she said.
   Beazer, on the other hand, declined to discuss anything but the
takeover or a friendly deal.
   Beazer was in Pittsburgh testifying before U.S. District Judge
Maurice Cohill in a hearing on Koppers' lawsuit contending the
Beazer group violated securities laws in launching its tender offer
March 3. The offer expires at midnight EDT Thursday.
   Cohill issued no ruling Tuesday.
   Koppers has disputed the accuracy of disclosures made in
documents issued in conjunction with the tender offer.
   In his testimony, Beazer identified documents suggesting
Koppers' chemicals businesses could be sold after the takeover for
as much as $700 million. The takeover plan calls for getting at
least $400 million for those operations, although Beazer said no
serious bidders had yet been found.

<HEAD>Japanese, U.S. Construction Firms Launch Joint Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fujita Corp., a major Japanese construction firm,
has launched an equally-owned joint venture with a U.S. design
engineering firm, a Fujita official said today.
   Fujita's linkup with Los Angeles-based Daniel, Mann, Johnson and
Mendenhall is the first such joint construction venture established
between Japanese and U.S. firms, said Hajime Shigeoka, Fujita
spokesman.
   DMJM Fujita Co., headed by Fujita President Kazuaki Fujita, will
conduct market research in and outside Japan and will gather
information on construction technologies, Shigeoka said. The new
firm also will plan, design, supervise and undertake contruction
projects.
   Fujita and DMJM have engaged in technological cooperation since
1965, according to Shigeoka.
   ``We will jointly launch business activities to cope with a new
age,'' Shigeoka quoted Fujita as saying.
   Shigeoka said the new company, with a capital of about $80,600,
was set up on Feb. 22 in Tokyo. The announcement of the venture was
delayed as company officials watched developments in U.S.-Japan
talks on American access to Japan's construction market.
   The construction issue has caused friction in trade relations
between the two nations, with many U.S. companies contending they
are virtually shut out of the Japanese construction market while
Japanese companies enjoy liberal access to U.S. customers.
   Late last month, Japanese and U.S. government officials agreed
Japan would encourage foreign participation in major public works
projects financed by the Japanese government, and in other projects
with central or local government funding.

<HEAD>Intel Unveils New Generation Of Microchips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILLSBORO, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research team for Intel Corp. has
developed a new series of microchips capable of executing 7.5
million instructions per second, the company has announced.
   The microchips, known as the 80960 family, are designed for such
uses as helping control robots, airplanes, automobiles and
telecommunications, according to J. Randolph Young, director of
Intel's Oregon Microcomputer Engineering Group.
   The microchips perform at two to three times the speed of
previous microchip generations used for similar machine-controlling
operations, Young said.
   In industrial markets, the chips are expected to supplement or
replace other Intel chips that have been available for as long as
10 years, he said Tuesday.
   The new chips' circuitry incorporates about 500,000 transistors
into a half-inch square of silicon. The circuitry involves parallel
architecture that allows the chip or a combination of chips to
attack various parts of a problem simultaneously, Young said.
   Unlike Intel's standard microprocessor and its predecessors, the
new chip is programmed only once for a specific function, he said.
   Two of the new chips were designed for commercial use and the
other two are for military applications, Young said.

   W. Russell Boss, a former president
and chairman of penmaker A.T. Cross Co., has died at age 79.
   Boss died Monday at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale.
   Boss began working as sales manager and treasurer of Cross in
1937, shortly after the death of his father Walter Russell Boss
Sr., owner of the Rhode Island-based company.
   Over the next 27 years, Boss rose to become chairman and
president of the company and helped it evolve from a private,
family-owned business with a dozen employees to a public company
with $155.4 million in revenue and more than 1,400 employees
worldwide.
   Boss in 1979 relinquished the chairmanship he had held since
1971 to his eldest son, Bradford R. Boss of Barrington, R.I. He
remained vice chairman until 1985, when he was named chairman
emeritus.
   The Providence, R.I., native served on the American Automobile
Association's governing board and bred thoroughbred horses in
Florida.
   Boss was survived by his wife Doris, two sons, a sister and six
grandchidren.
   Services were scheduled for Saturday in Cranston, R.I.

<HEAD>Court: Model Worker Ineligible For Benefits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arizona Court of Appeals has ruled
that Honeywell Inc. does not have to pay worker compensation to a
model employee who fainted, struck his head and suffered severe and
permanent brain damage after being told he was being demoted.
   The court ruled Tuesday in a case involving Kenneth Murphy, who
had worked for Honeywell for 19 years and was described by his
supervisor, Jim Enk, as a good, punctual employee who never
complained and appeared to enjoy his work.
   ``We conclude that claimant's physical injury did not result
from an unexpected, unusual, or extraordinary stress related to
employment,'' Judge J. Thomas Brooks wrote in the three-member
court's unanimous ruling. ``The physical injury is therefore
noncompensable as an industrial injury.''
   Murphy's attorney, Walter Ulman, called Tuesday's decision
``disappointing but not too surprising'' in light of precedents and
said he anticpated an appeal to the state Supreme Court.
   Murphy, who is described as being in a vegatative state, was
injured Aug. 8, 1985 when Enk told him that he was being reassigned
in a cost-cutting move to a job that required different skills and
carried a one-third cut in pay. The change also meant working for a
new manager reputed to be a strict disciplinarian and about whom
Murphy already had expressed concern.
   ``Enk turned to walk away, and claimaint took two or three steps
after him,'' Brooks wrote. ``Enk then turned back to speak with
claimant again and saw him falling straight over backwards.
Claimant's head struck the tile-covered concrete floor causing
permanent brain damage.''
   Rumors about pending job cuts had been circulating at Honeywell
for one or two months, and Murphy was worried about financial
problems if he were displaced, according to court records. He also
feared a new job might lead to a recurrence of earlier,
work-related hernia problems.
   Expert witnesses who testified on Murphy's behalf said the faint
stemmed from emotional shock and his present condition was unlikely
to improve.
   But the judges said previous state Supreme Court rulings made it
clear that physical injuries caused by job-related emotional stress
need not be compensated ``unless the stress is unusual, unexpected
or extraordinary.''
   And they said that threatened economic hardship, ``including
such naturally traumatic events as layoffs and plant closures, may
indeed expose the affected workers to varying degrees of emotional
distress, but are not sufficiently unexpected, unusual or
extraordinary in modern society to warrant compensability as an
industrial injury.''
   A switchboard operator at Honeywell's Phoenix-area headquarters
said no one was available for comment immediately.

<HEAD>UAW Leader Wants Workers Profit-Sharing Tied to Exec Bonuses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers union officials
gathering today to formulate contract demands for Chrysler Corp.
also prepared for a potentially bitter debate over the contract
status of workers at the company's Kenosha, Wis. plant.
   Separately, UAW Vice President Marc Stepp said the union may
seek contract provisions to guarantee that workers receive
profit-sharing bonuses whenever Chrysler executives receive
bonuses, regardless of the company's performance.
   Union representatives began gathering Tuesday to prepare for the
April 18th opening of contract talks with the nation's
third-largest automaker.
   In addition to contract demands, the 140-member UAW national
Chrysler Council also was faced with the potentially divisive issue
of whether 800 to 1,000 former American Motors Corp. workers in
Kenosha should be brought under the national Chrysler contract.
   Chrysler, which bought AMC last year, decided earlier this year
to close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha by year's end,
leaving only an engine plant and some metal-stamping operations
operating.
   Stepp said he wants to include the remaining workers,
represented by UAW Local 72, under the Chrysler contract _ which
covers 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers at 49 local unions.
He said the Kenosha workers now are Chrysler employees and he wants
to prevent Chrysler from moving their work _ they build engines for
Jeeps assembled at a plant in Toledo, Ohio _ to factories in Mexico
or Canada.
   But other Chrysler workers said admitting the Kenosha workers
would take jobs away from workers laid off from Chrysler plants.
Workers from closed Chrysler plants have the right to move into
jobs that open through attrition at other factories _ a privilege
that would be extended to the Kenosha workers if they came under
the national pact.
   Chrysler workers said the issue was sensitive because of the
automaker's recent attempt to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc.
parts subsidiary. Chrysler terminated that proposal in early March
in the face of bitter UAW opposition including the threat of
crippling plant-by-plant strikes.
   ``How can you accept them into the Chrysler council when our
people aren't even secure yet _ Acustar or Chrysler ?'' said Tony
DeFrancesco, bargaining chairman of Local 624 at Chrysler New
Process Gear plant in Syracuse, N.Y.
   The Syracuse plant, which makes manual front-wheel-drive
transmissions, is part of Acustar.
   But Stepp said he believed much of the opposition came from fear
that the soon-to-be-laid-off Kenosha assembly workers also would be
included, which they would not.
   He also argued that the UAW historically has brought business
and plants purchased by automakers _ such as the Syracuse plant _
under those companies' national contracts, usually resulting in
increased wages and benefits for the new additions.
   The council was to discuss proposed demands today and vote on a
demand package Thursday. Stepp said the package, which in most ways
will mirror contracts signed last fall at General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co., also may seek to guarantee workers a share of
profits whenever corporate executives receive bonuses.
   The Ford and GM contracts include worker profit-sharing payments
based on sales and the companies' financial performance. But Stepp
said that because executives receive bonuses regardless of their
companies' performance, so should workers.
   The UAW also wants to close potential loopholes that have
appeared in the job protection provisions in the Ford and GM
contracts, Stepp said.
   Both pacts forbid plant closings that were not announced before
last year's negotiations but allow workers to be laid off if sales
of a product fall.
   GM has said it will idle two plants indefinitely later this year
because sales of their products are slow.

<HEAD>Free Prescription Drugs To Treat Heart Disease Available Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   G.D. Searle & Co. is broadening its program to
give free drugs to the the poor to include all of its medication
for heart disease.
   Last year, Searle began providing its high blood pressure
medicine to people who could not afford to buy it and had no
insurance. Now, all seven of its drugs that treat cardiovascular
problems will be available to poor people without charge, said Dr.
Sheldon G. Gilgore, chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``I personally believe that all drugs that treat
life-threatening diseases should be involved,'' Gilgore said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``But cardiovascular drugs are about
all we make.''
   No one who suffers from cardiovascular disease should be denied
medication because they can't afford it, he said.
   Searle, which is based in Skokie, Ill., is inviting all
physicians in the nation to participate in the program, which cost
the company $9 million last year.
   Bill Greener, a senior vice president, said Searle does not know
how much the expanded program will cost, but he said the company
expects it will double the existing program.
   ``There's no money limit on it,'' he said.
   Gilgore said the company will deliver $1 million worth of
certificates to clinics and hospitals in 10 major cities today to
dramatize the expansion of its ``Patient in Need'' program.
   Any physician, clinic or hospital in the nation may request
Searle certificates for needy patients.
   The company sets broad guidelines for patients to qualify but
leaves it up to the individual physician to make the decision.
   The company is mailing instructions to doctors that classify
poor people as those with annual household incomes of $8,000 for
one or two people, or $11,000 for three or more family members. To
qualify, patients must not have insurance or other assistance that
would pay for the drug.
   ``It's up to the doctor to determine, but the patient doesn't
have to bring in tax returns or anything like that,'' said Gilgore.
``We believe the doctor knows who his poor patients are.''
   Searle launched the pilot program with two drugs that treat high
blood pressure in February 1987. Twenty-thousand patients have
received free medication.
   The new expanded program includes five additional products used
to treat high blood pressure, angina, arrhythmias and congestive
heart failure.
   ``The American pharmaceutical industry can satisfy the unmet
prescription needs of the medically indigent patient population in
this country,'' Gilgore said.
   Judee Shuler of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association in
Washington, D.C., said Tuesday that all pharmaceutical companies do
something but Searle is more extensive at working with the
health-care delivery system.
   She said the other companies will help out in individual need
cases or in third-world countries. But she said she knows of no
other pharmaceutical company doing the same kind of work as Searle.
   Searle is a research-based company which develops, manufactures
and markets prescription pharmaceuticals worldwide. It is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Monsanto Co.
   Two-thirds of Searle's sales are in cardiovascular drugs,
Greener said. The other third is primarily oral contraceptives, he
said.

   A bitter power struggle is occurring
over the publishing empire built by the late Axel Springer, with
his wife, two friends and a longtime media industry rival fighting
for control of the company.
   The highly successful Springer empire, which has annual sales of
about $1.6 billion, publishes West Germany's largest daily
newspaper, Bild, and dozens of other mass-circulation publications.
   Leo Kirch, another wealthy media entrepreneur, pooled his
Springer shares with those of brothers Franz and Frieder Burda,
also publishers, last month to amass a stake larger than that of
Springer's heirs.
   West German news media have dubbed the resulting power struggle
```Dallas' on the Elbe,'' in reference to the popular American soap
opera and to the location of Hamburg _ where Springer has
publishing plants _ on the Elbe River. ``I think this (dispute)
will simmer down, and the sooner the better,'' Ernst Cramer,
advisor to the Springer family, told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from his West Berlin office.
   Cramer played down the feud, saying: ``The interests of the
major shareholders are all the same _ for the company to remain
successful. This matter is not insurmountable.''
   
   But Springer's widow, 45-year-old Friede Springer, has said in
West German interviews that the affair has angered her.
   ``I am infinitely disappointed with the Burdas,'' the March 28
issue of the newsmagazine Der Spiegel quoted her as saying. ``I
never imagined they would pull this kind of thing.''
   A spokeswoman for Kirch, Armgard von Burgsdorff, insisted Kirch
is interested only in the Springer company's continued success.
   ``The purpose of the agreement (with the Burda brothers) is to
establish a stable majority, and to provide the publishing house
with a leading role in a changing media world,'' she told the AP in
a telephone interview from Kirch's Munich office.
   Powers within the company have squabbled since 73-year-old Axel
Springer died on Sept. 22, 1985, leaving his wife and two sons as
direct heirs.
   Springer built a family-owned empire that in addition to the 5
million daily-circulation Bild includes the respected conservative
daily, Die Welt.
   The day he died, the company stated that a few weeks earlier
Springer had ``converted the company into a joint stock company..
.to safeguard the future of his holdings.'' Among the stockholders
were the Burda brothers and Kirch.
   Under a complicated formula, Springer's heirs and executors
received control of about 26 percent of the company's shares, the
Burda brothers 25.9 percent and Kirch 10 percent. The rest went to
the stock exchange.
   Kirch says that in addition to his 10 percent share, he has
obtained support from owners of another 16 percent of Springer
stock.
   Mrs. Burgsdorff said the Springer heirs had agreed verbally in
1986 that Kirch should have a stake of up to 26 percent, but the
family later changed its mind. She said Kirch then began
discussions with the Burdas.
   The Axel Springer Verlag company is overseen by a supervisory
board, whose members include the Burdas and Mrs. Springer but not
Kirch.
   Kirch is involved in film distribution and production and other
media areas. The Burda family owns the West German ``Bunte''
magazine and other publications.
   Despite gaining more support through the Burdas and other
shareholders, Kirch has not yet been able to overcome Mrs.
Springer's opposition to his obtaining a seat on the supervisory
board.
   Mrs. Burgsdorff said Axel Springer had included Kirch in the
shareholding formula ``because he knew Leo Kirch would be a strong
media personality in the future.''
   Neither Mrs. Springer nor the Burda brothers could be reached
for comment on Tuesday.
   Cramer, the Springer family advisor, said: ``For the family, the
legacy of Axel Springer is important.''
   But he added, ``This (dispute) almost had to come. Before it was
owned by a family, now we are a shareholders' company.''

<HEAD>GE REaches Agreement To Acquire Roper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. and Roper Corp.
said today they have reached a definitive merger agreement that
will allow GE to move ahead with its proposed $507.6 million
aquisition of Roper.
   GE also extended its tender offer deadline by seven hours, until
midnight Monday. GE, based in Fairfield, has offered $54 a share
for Roper's outstanding stock.
   GE was tendered nearly 7.6 million shares as of Tuesday, while
it needs only 4.7 million to take control of Roper, GE spokesman
Jack Batty said today.
   The definitive agreement with Roper was the final hurdle prior
to stockholder approval in a complicated acquisition that was made
simpler last week when Whirlpool Corp. dropped out of the bidding.
The battle for Roper, an appliance and lawn equipment manufacturer
based in Augusta, Ga., began in November.
   Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Mich. bid $50 a share, or
$470 million, in its merger attempt. It decided to let GE complete
a deal unopposed after the two appliance giants agreed to share
Roper products.
   The agreement between GE and Whirlpool allows GE to acquire
Roper and its manufacturing capacity. Whirlpool, in return, will
get rights to the Roper name for major appliances. GE will supply
Whirlpool with Roper-brand electric and gas ranges for at least two
years. Roper also will continue to sell its products to Sears,
Roebuck and Co.
   The parties also agreed to other commercial relationships
whereby GE would sell to Whirlpool certain industrial components
and materials.

<HEAD>Saudi Oil Minister Replaces American as Aramco Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham
Nazer has replaced an American to become the first Saudi chairman
of Arabian American Oil Co., his country's major oil-producing
company.
   Nazer took over from John J. Kelberer, who headed Aramco for 10
years. Aramco President Ali I. Naimi will succeed Kelberer as chief
executive.
   The appointment of Nazer, announced late Tuesday in Houston,
reflects the shrinking role in Aramco of the four big U.S. oil
companies that were formerly partners in the venture: Exxon Corp.,
Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp. and Mobil Corp.
   The Saudi government has gradually taken over control of Aramco
from the four companies starting in the 1970s, so that it is now
100 percent Saudi-owned. The four oil majors now mainly provide
technical assistance to the Saudis.
   Kelberer will remain on the board of directors as vice chairman,
although he has effectively retired.
   Kelberer has undergone a number of major surgical operations in
recent years and is understood to have sought retirement after
turning 60 two years ago. He has worked in Saudi Arabia for more
than 37 years, as Aramco's chairman and chief executive for the
past decade.
   The change in Kelberer's position leaves only two Americans in
operating positions equal to vice president or higher at Aramco
headquarters in Dhahran. Of Aramco's 42,000 or so employees in
Saudi Arabia, only about 2,500 are Americans.
   The Saudi government appointed Nazer oil minister in November
1986, replacing Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani.
   Nazer is studying a possible reorganization of the kingdom's oil
industry, according to U.S. sources. The new structure, which is
expected to include the creation of a Saudi national oil company,
could be built on either Aramco or Petromin, the sources said.
   Petromin is the marketing company for Saudi petroleum products.
   In addition to his posts as oil minister and Aramco chairman,
Nazer also heads Petromin and the Royal Commission for Jubail and
Yanbu, the body overseeing the country's petrochemical industry.

<HEAD>EEC Finds No Signs of Economic Recession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a slight drop in the European
Economic Community's economic sentiment indicator in February, the
12-nation trading bloc is not heading for a recession, the EEC
reported Wednesday.
   The EEC Commission, citing the latest business and consumer
survey, said there were ``no signs of an approaching recession.''
It said the stock market crash and the turbulence on
foreign-exchange markets last fall affected ``economic performance
less than originally feared.''
   The commission said the EEC's economic indicator, which is based
partly on the results of the survey, dropped to 102.7 in February
from 102.9 in January, but was above the 102.6 level recorded in
November 1987 after the October crash.
   The indicator comprises an industrial confidence indicator, a
construction confidence indicator, a consumer confidence indicator
and stock price indexes.
   EEC economists reported that production expectations continued
to point toward further growth over the next few months, while the
outlook for exports looked brighter than anticipated.
   Lower-than-expected production results in Britain since last
December have led industrialists there to revise their production
expectations significantly downward, the commission said.
   The consumer confidence indicator lost a point in February over
the preceding month, and consumers remained cautious about
purchasing durables, the commission said.
   Retailers also continued to feel slightly pessimistic about
future prospects, but their assessment of the overall business
situation remained positive, according to the report.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Offers Senior Citizens Age-Matching Discounts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines announced a two-month
discount that will give senior citizens a percentage off their fare
that matches their age.
   For example, a 65-year-old will receive a 65 percent discount
and a 100-year-old will fly free, the airline said Tuesday.
   ``The stock phrase, `I'm not getting older, just better,'
deserves an updating,'' said A.B. Magary, executive vice president
of marketing for Northwest. ``The older you are the greater your
discount gets.''
   The discount, which covers people aged 65 and older, is good
from April 12 through June 8 and applies to all full economy fares
on Northwest's domestic flights. The fares may be used every day
except Fridays and Sundays and May 31, and reservations must be
made and tickets purchased at least seven days in advance.
   Travel must include at least two nights' stay before returning
and must be concluded by June 8.
   Magary said the idea is to stimulate discretionary travel until
the peak summer season begins in June.
   With that goal in mind, Eastern Airlines and Continental
Airlines _ both subsidiaries of giant Texas Air Corp. _ announced
Tuesday that they are reducing fares for the next two months on
tickets carrying restrictions used mainly by vacationers. American
Airlines and United Airlines made similar fare cuts.
   Texas Air's ``spring sales'' are for travel between April 18 and
June 15, with no one-way fare greater than $99 for travel anywhere
in the mainland United States.
   The discount fares carry numerous restrictions and are not
refundable. Tickets must be purchased in the next nine days.
   Magary said Tuesday that Northwest will match the Eastern and
Continental fares in most Northwest markets. Northwest was alone in
offering the senior citizen discounts.
   Magary said another goal of the discount program is to introduce
World-Horizons, a frequent-flier program for seniors modeled after
similar plans at other airlines. Seniors who enroll in the
Northwest plan, which begins June 1, can obtain discounted fares on
many Northwest flights.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.29 million shares at

Tuesday's session.
   Analysts say investors' uncertainty about the direction of the
economy and interest rates have put a damper on stock price gains.
They say some investors have also been unable to shake worries
inspired by last October's price crash.
   In the credit markets today, the federal funds rate, a key
interest rate indicator which is what banks charge each other for
short-term loans, edged over 7 percent. Rising rates normally
depress stock prices.
   But Jack Baker, head of block trading for Shearson Lehman

   Wheat futures prices moved higher this morning on

   Follow through buying from Tuesday's strong runup kept the wheat

   After the close of trading on Tuesday, the Agriculture
Department announced that it is offering China 2 million tons of

   This and an expected Soviet bid Thursday on a half million tons

   On the opening, wheat was 2\ cents to 3 cents higher with the

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For generations the unwritten code of conduct
among bankers rendered hostile takeovers virtually taboo; that is,
until the oldest bank in the country saw fit to break with
tradition.
   Bank of New York Co. _ founded by Alexander Hamilton eight years
after the the Declaration of Independence was signed and so
ingrained in tradition it was sometimes dubbed the sleeping giant _
startled its colleagues by making a brash move for control of rival
Irving Bank Corp. last fall.
   The joke around Bank of New York and elsewhere had been that
before Hamilton was killed in a duel, he told his employees not to
do anything until he returned, and that was the way business has
been conducted ever since.
   ``That's the impression a lot of people on the outside looking
in have had of the Bank of New York,'' said company spokesman Owen
Brady. ``Of course, that's not true.''
   Under the leadership of J. Carter Bacot since 1982, Bank of New
York has moved to expand its market. Its twice-revised tender offer
for Irving of $1.08 billion began last month with regulatory
approval but without Irving's blessings.
   Although it wasn't the first hostile bank bid, it is the largest
deal of its kind to have progressed this far in a close-knit
industry that tries to avoid controversy.
   Banking analysts say hostile bids could become more commonplace,
particularly among aggressive regional institutions, although they
don't foresee the same type of takeover frenzy prevalent in other
industries since the Oct. 19 stock market crash made share prices
attractive.
   ``The trend is evolutionary, not revolutionary,'' said James J.
McDermott Jr., an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods. ``However,
we do think that the ground has been broken with Bank of New York
and that under the appropriate financial circumstances we could see
other hostile offers.''
   The Federal Reserve's approval of the Bank of New York bid _ in
which the Fed declined to make any distinction between a friendly
or hostile offer _ may encourage other institutions to take chances
on takeovers even under stormy conditions.
   Banks have been merging, under friendly terms, at a fierce clip
in recent years to keep pace with economic conditions, interstate
banking law and new types of non-bank competitors like Sears,
Roebuck & Co. The industry also has been struggling with
deteriorating profits due to shaky loans to Third World countries
and to depressed domestic oil and farm regions.
   Since 1982, banks have led the nation in mergers and
acquisitions, with an average 260 friendly deals a year during that
period. Many more are expected as more states open their doors to
outsiders.
   Despite the motivations, the nation's 14,000 commercial banks
face significant hurdles in the merger process that other
industries don't have to clear.
   For one thing, banks have to go through a laundry list of local
and government regulations, not to mention waiting periods and
certain capital requirements, before even trying to win over
shareholders.
   Among the agencies to pass judgment are the Fed, state banking
boards, Securities and Exchange Commission, and in some cases local
community groups. And depending on the bank's charter, the
comptroller of the currency also could step in.
   ``It's like a 12-course meal. It's very easy to overcook and
undercook at any given time, and getting them off the table at the
right times is not easy,'' said Michael Rosen, a Boston attorney
specializing in bank mergers.
   ``Banking is really, in a way, quasi-public. It's different from
other businesses. It (banks' coexistence) is definitely more than a
gentlemen's agreement.''
   Unlike other businesses, which, for the most part, can continue
selling or manufacturing uninterrupted, banks have to worry about
maintaining their trademark personal service.
   ``The banking business ... is really a people business,''
explained Stephen Berman, an analyst with County Securities USA.
``As a rule a bank has gotten to the position it's in, based on its
people and management.''
   The depature of certain managers after a hostile takeover, for
instance, could jeopardize a loan agreement that might have been in
the works or force wary customers to move their deposits elsewhere,
he said.
   Berman also noted that hostile suitors, in particular, who are
not privy to all of a target bank's books face additional obstacles.
   ``A bank's assets are much more difficult to judge than an
industrial company,'' he said. `` ... The principal asset of a
banking company is that loan portfolio composed of thousands of
individual loans. When you get down to it we know little about
them.''
   In the proposed Bank of New York-Irving merger, many analysts
agree that a combination of the two wouldn't be such a bad idea
since both New York banks operate in a similar marketplace and
offer similar services like securities processing.
   ``More to the point Irving has been an underperforming
institution,'' said McDermott.
   But most analysts are split as to whether Bank of New York will
succeed in creating one of the nation's 15th largest bank holding
companies with assets of more than $40 billion.
   Bank of New York's current offer _ of $15 in cash and 1.575
shares of its own stock for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 million
common shares outstanding _ has been denounced as inadequate by
Irving's board of directors.
   Irving, which was founded in 1851 and also criticized as being a
``sleeper,'' has stressed its desire to remain independent,
although it said it was talking with other parties and may seek a
``white knight,'' or friendly merger partner as an alternative to
Bank of New York.
   It has taken a number of steps to spurn Bank of New York's
advances, including instituting an anti-takeover ``poison pill,''
intended to make any hostile buyout prohibitively expensive, and
filing suit to block a proxy solicitation by Bank of New York.
Shareholders are scheduled to vote on Bank of New York's proposed
slate of 16 nominees to Irving's board in about two weeks.
   Meanwhile, industry watchers say that if Bank of New York
succeeds it will be especially noteworthy, given the track record
of similar proposals.
   Two years ago, First Interstate Bancorp made an unsolicited $3.2
billion bid for ailing BankAmerica Corp., but the proposal was
spurned and the offer withdrawn. Last year, Banc One Corp. became
Marine Corp.'s white knight after Marshall & Ilsley Corp. made a
$560 million cash and stock offer.
   In fact, since 1981, there have only been three significant
successful hostile deals, although all have been under $100
million, according to Mergers & Acquisitions magazine.
   ``All bankers know each other. They all go to the same social
events. It's not easy to be an outcast,'' said Rosen.

   Stock prices turned slightly lower today, as an
early rally effort faded in lackluster trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 16.91
points on Tuesday, was unchanged at 1,997.51 at noon on Wall Street.
   But losers ran slightly ahead of gainers in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 612 up, 640 down and
531 unchanged. And several broader market indicators were down
slightly.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 64.48 million shares at
noontime, compared with 63.78 million shares at the same point in
Tuesday's session.
   The stock market opened higher today, but gave up those early
gains as the session wore on.
   ``We had a little buying enthusiasm as a remnant from
yesterday's strong close, but then ran into a lot of resistance,''
said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI Securities
Corp. ``Now, we've bogged down here in narrow trading range.''
   Analysts say investors' uncertainty about the direction of the
economy and interest rates have put a damper on stock prices. They
say some investors have also been unable to shake worries inspired
by last October's price crash.
   In the credit markets today, the federal funds rate, a key
short-term interest rate, edged over 7 percent. Rising rates make
bonds a more appealing investment than stocks to some investors.
   F.W. Woolworth was among the most actively-traded stocks on the
NYSE, falling 1| to 55. The stock shot up more than $11 a share in
the previous two sessions after a group led by Dart Group Corp.
Chairman Herbert Haft expressed interest in acquiring a stake in
the retailer.
   A number of utility issues were also among the most active
issues. Illinois Power was off [ at 21], Carolina Power & Light was
unchanged at 33 and Bell South was up \ at 37|.
   Among the most widely-held stocks, American Telephone &
Telegraph was up [ at 27, International Business Machines was down
1] at 106[ and General Electric was off ] at 40\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.06 at 146.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index slipped 0.52 to 294.55.

<HEAD>Cable Shopping Service Suffers $20 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fashion Channel Network home shopping
service reported a first-year loss of $20 million and announced the
departure of its chairman and chief executive.
   The company, which sells clothes, cosmetics and accessories over
cable television, had sales of $5.5 million in its first four
months of operation, according to the announcement Tuesday.
   The Fashion Channel, which formed about a year ago and went on
the air in October, announced that co-founder Charles W. Gee would
no longer serve as chairman and chief executive officer.
   Gee was the last of three founding top executives to leave the
management. In January, the company announced the departures of
Raymond L. Klauer, a former May Co. California president, and Wayne
C. Smith.
   Gee will remain as a director.
   Fashion Channel's newly named president, Donald Miller, said he
has been talking to several parties interested in buying part of
the company, including Shop Television Network, which is backed by
J.C. Penney and STN of Hollywood; QVC and Cable Value Network.
   ``The company is still operating,'' Miller said Tuesday. ``It's
busniess as usual and we're holding down the fort. But it's not
fun.''
   The company attributed much of the loss to start-up costs.
   The company's stock took a drastic plunge in the October market
crash, just over two weeks after it was first offered to the public.
   Since then, Fashion Channel has been forced to move merchandise
by cutting prices drastically, said analyst Larry Gerbrandt of Paul
Kagan Associates in Carmel. Gerbrandt also blamed the loss in part
on overbuying of goods that proved unattractive to customers.

   The stock market shook off some midday blues and
pushed broadly and sharply higher this afternoon in tandem with a
rise in the dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 16.91
points on Tuesday, was up another 33.33 points at 2,030.84 as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outpaced losers by a margin of 5 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,050 up, 416
down and 430 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 119.36 million shares with two
hours left in the session, compared with 95.25 million shares at
the same point in Tuesday's session.
   The stock market opened with some modest gains but had given
them back by noontime before moving broadly higher in the early
afternoon.
   Analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar
in foreign exchange trading.
   The dollar moved higher, they said, on speculation that the
major industrial nations may be moving toward an agreement aimed at
placing a lower limit on the currency against the Japanese yen.
   Newton D. Zinder, who follows the stock market for the
investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton, said stock prices rose
sharply in response because an agreement would reduce chances that
the Federal Reserve would tighten its credit policy in a bid to
head off inflation.
   A tightening by the central bank would encourage higher interest
rates, making bonds more attractive as an investment in comparison
with stocks.

<HEAD>Turner Property To Be Sold At Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Feds are finally getting Glenn Turner's
castle.
   A federal court and the Internal Revenue Service have begun
foreclosure proceedings on the three-story, long-uncompleted castle
owned by the hillbilly entrepreneur who made and lost a fortune by
selling motivational-training and cosmetics franchises in the 1970s.
   The IRS has been trying for 10 years to collect a $15 million
back-taxes claim against Turner, 53, who was in and out of trouble
with the law for years because of what investigators said were
illegal pyramid schemes that defrauded thousands of investors.
   He is currently serving a seven-year prison term in Arizona on
fraud convictions.
   Now, one of his prized possessions, the 16-room castle and 79
surrounding acres on Bear Gulley Lake in neighboring Seminole
County, Fla., is being sold at auction to satisfy an IRS judgment
against him in U.S. District Court in Orlando.
   But the IRS figures it will be lucky to get even a fraction of
the final amount set by the court: $9.275 million.
   The estate was appraised by the county at $1.13 million in 1987,
and recent appraisals by private companies list its value at
between $1.6 million and $2 million.
   Senior U.S. District Judge George Young will hold a hearing
April 26 to decide if two bids for the property _ or any new ones
made in the interim _ will be accepted.
   Once the property is sold, Seminole County has the right to be
paid first from the proceeds. County Tax Collector G. Troy Ray said
about $16,900 in unpaid property taxes is owed on the property for
1987.
   Turner and his family haven't paid property taxes since 1979,
but private investors have bought tax certificates equal to the
back taxes each year. Under such an arrangement, the investors pay
the taxes and earn 18 percent interest until the property is sold
and the tax funds are paid back to them.
   Those tax payments will come from the sale, too.
   Court documents indicate there are dozens of other Turner
creditors, but it is unlikely that they will be paid until all of
the IRS judgment is satisfied, officials said.
   Bids on the Castle property will be advertised over the next few
weeks to notify any potential bidders of the pending sale. Besides
the castle, there is a boathouse with a three-bedroom apartment and
a stable.
   The castle and boathouse have been vacant for several years, and
the castle has been used only for tours and charitable events.
   Turner's financial empire crumbled in 1973 after he reportedly
made about $300 million through aggressive marketing of his
Orlando-based Dare To Be Great motivational classes and Koscot
cosmetics distributorships.
   The self-styled country boy, son of a South Carolina
sharecropper, rose to fame through inspirational speeches that
promised great wealth if people bought distributorships in his
operations.
   The companies collapsed under lawsuits filed by investors and
investigations by state and federal agencies.
   Turner and a longtime partner, Edward Rector, 57, were sentenced
to prison in Arizona on charges of operating a pyramid scheme there
and defrauding investors through a later self-motivational company
called Challenge Inc.

   The number of help-wanted advertisements in
major newspapers rose slightly in February, indicating employers'
hiring plans are little changed, the Conference Board said
Wednesday.
   The business research group's Help-Wanted Index rose to 156 in
February from 153 in January, when the barometer dipped slightly.
It stood at roughly the same level as in December.
   ``Want-ad volume suggests that hiring intentions are flat at
best, as business executives take a hard look at plans for further
expansion of operations,''said Kenneth Goldstein, a Conference
Board economist.
   With the growth in the labor force, stagnant hiring plans could
result in higher unempoyement, Goldstein said. The Labor Department
has reported the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent last month.
   The index measures the volume of classified advertising in 51
major newspapers across the country. It is considered sensitive to
changes in the demand for labor and to overall business conditions.
   Advertising volume rose in the West South Central, Middle
Atlantic, New England, Pacific and South Atlantic regions. Volume
fell in the East North Central, East South Central, West North
Central and Mountain regions.

   Wheat futures advanced while the other grains and
soybeans were mostly lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat continued the gains posted during a sharp runup on
Tuesday, and overnight news gave the market fresh incentive.
   The Agriculture Department announced after the close of trading
on Tuesday that it was offering China 2 million tons of subsidized
wheat.
   This along with expectations that the Soviet Union will bid on a
half million tons of wheat this week combined to create a sense of
optimism in the wheat pit, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Soybeans struggled a little higher during the day, but collapsed
under late selling pressure.
   On the close, wheat was 1} cents to 3 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.09 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents

   Slightly more companies raised their

confidence that the economy isn't headed into a recession following
the stock market crash, Standard & Poor's Corp. reported Tuesday.
   For the first three months of 1988, dividend increases rose 4.8
percent, to 482 from 460 in 1987, S&P said. At the same time,
decreased and omitted dividends fell to 47 from 58 in the quarter,
it said.
   ``The rebound in dividend increases shows that fears of a
recession due to the market crash have abated,'' said Arnie
Kaufman, editor of S&P's Outlook newsletter.
   ``Recovery in the manufacturing sector is enabling many formerly
depressed businesses to participate in dividend largesse after
years of struggling to merely hold the line.''
   Despite the Oct. 19 stock collapse, Kaufman said corporations
were optimistic the economy would continue to expand this year
because of recent upbeat trade, employment and consumer spending
reports.
   Companies reporting dividend actions to S&P comprise a
substantial portion of all public companies in the United States.

<HEAD>Union Officials Meet Over Single-Union, No-Strike Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of the Trades Union Congress met
Wednesday to consider what the organization's policy should be
regarding controversial single-union and no-strike deals, issues
which threaten to split up the TUC.
   Two member unions which have reached such deals on their own
have threatened to pull out of the TUC, Britain's umbrella labor
union organization, over the issue.
   The TUC's special review body, made up of about 20 members of
its general council, held a one-day meeting to consider various
proposals. The review body includes the TUC's general secretary,
Norman Willis.
   ``The issue is whether or not there should be some form of
direction to unions about single-union and no-strike deals, and if
there were such things, how they should be sanctioned,'' said a TUC
spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name.
   ``I am not aware of any particular details,'' he said.
   The review body was formed at the TUC's annual convention last
September to review several areas. It is considering, among other
things, whether unions should be required to ballot their members
before agreeing to such deals, the Times of London reported.
   The body, which has been holding a series of meetings, is
expected to announce its recommendations in a report issued before
the next convention in September, at which TUC delegates would vote
on them.
   Britain's unions have been bitterly divided over whether to
accept these deals, which have become more common in recent years,
particularly at plants owned by Japanese companies.
   The unions have disagreed on how best to fight the loss of their
power under the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher _ which has introduced union-curbing legislation that, for
example, requires unions to ballot their members before calling a
strike.
   The deals are strongly opposed by Ron Todd, head of the
Transport and General Workers Union, Britain's largest union.
   Eric Hammond, general secretary of the electricians union, known
as the EETPU, has threatened several times to ballot his 336,000
members on pulling out of the TUC.
   Hammond has the support of Bill Jordan, president of the
Amalgamated Engineering Union, who also has warned that he would
try to bring his 857,000-strong union out of the TUC if he were
prevented from signing more of the controversial deals.
   The AEU is the country's second-largest union.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Europeans Risk Trade Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter told
the governments of Britain, France, West Germany and Spain on
Wednesday they are risking a trade war by their ``enormous
subsidies'' to Airbus passenger planes.
   The major trade bill now before Congress would permit the
charging of extra ``countervailing'' duties on imports of the
Airbus. They would be designed to compensate for the subsidies,
raising the price of the foreign planes and thus improving the
chances of U.S. aircraft manufacturers making sales to airlines
here.
   ``The longer these governments delay in coming to grips with
their own subsidies for Airbus, the more they heighten the risk of
a major trade conflict,'' Yeutter said in a statement.
   With the statement, Yeutter's office distributed a detailed
refutation of a report on March 18 by Airbus Industrie, the
consortium that makes the planes, on U.S. subsidies to aircraft
manufacturers. He criticized the report as containing ``poor
scholarship and false conclusions.''
   It said the U.S. government had provided about $23 billion in
direct and indirect subsidies over the past decade to Boeing Co.
and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   U.S. trade officials have long complained that the European
subsidies give European aircraft builders an unfair advantage over
U.S. companies.
   ``The U.S. does not directly support civil aircraft programs,''
Yeutter said. ``It is the four European governments that have
lavished gigantic sums on Airbus for nearly two decades despite the
program's inability to show any profit.''
   He said he expects to see members of the European governments in
Paris in mid-May and would like to discuss indirect subsidies
before then.
   ``We will not hold such discussions on the basis of a `study'
that has no credibility,'' he said.
   After the last negotiations at Constance, West Germany, on March
18, Yeutter said a first step had been taken in a prospective
agreement on production subsidies but that there was still a long
way to go on subsidies for research and development.
   The statement issued by Yeutter's office said the U.S.
government buys goods for its own needs and not to benefit any
manufacturer. When major contractors make profits, they can spend
them as they will, it added.
   ``By contrast, the Airbus partners must spend the money supplied
to them by their governments on commercial airplane development and
nothing else,'' the statement said.

   The one millionth automobile produced by
Honda in the United States will roll off the assembly line Friday,
Honda officials announced Wednesday.
   The car, a Honda Civic four-door sedan, will be driven off the
assembly line by the first associate hired at Honda of America
Manufacturing in 1978, Al Kinzer. Honda refers to its employees as
associates.
   Honda said the production of its one millionth car in the United
States signifies rapid growth and customer acceptance of the
products made at the company's auto assembly plant in Marysville,
about 35 miles northwest of Columbus in central Ohio, and at its
engine plant in Anna in western Ohio.
   The car's engine, a 16-valve, four-cylinder fuel-injected
powerplant, was made at the engine plant.
   Kinzer was hired as manager of administration when Honda started
operations at Marysville in 1978. He now is plant manager of the
engine plant.
   Honda is the nation's fourth-largest car company in sales and
manufacturing. It began manufacturing in the United States in
September 1979 with production at its motorcycle plant in
Marysville.
   The auto plant at Marysville began production in November 1982.
The engine plant at Anna opened in July 1985.
   The company last month broke ground for a new assembly plant
near its Marysville operation. The new plant, called the East
Liberty Auto Plant, will make Civic four-door sedans.
   Honda, the first Japanese automaker to build cars in the United
States, employs about 5,900 people at its auto, motorcycle and
engine plants in Ohio, said Honda of America spokesman Roger F.
Lambert.

<HEAD>Real Estate Purchases in U.S. Totaled $12.77 Billion, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investors bought $12.77 billion
worth of U.S. real estate in 1987, a 70 percent increase over the
previous year, according to a new report.
   The purchases were concentrated in markets traditionally favored
by the Japanese _ Hawaii, California and New York _ but investors
are broadening their sights to include other areas as well,
according to a study released Wednesday.
   The study, conducted for the last three years by Kenneth
Laventhal & Co., a nationwide accounting firm, is based on
information from clients, public records and other sources, and is
described by the company as a slight underestimation.
   The buying binge is spurred by the rising value of the yen in
relation to the dollar, the tight real estate market in Japan and
attractive rates of return on U.S. commercial real estate ranging
from 6 percent to 9 percent a year, said Jack Rodman, managing
partner of the company's Los Angeles office.
   Japanese real estate purchases mushroomed in the three years of
the study: $1.86 billion in 1985, $7.53 billion in 1986 and $12.77
billion in 1987.
   In 1987, Hawaii was the favorite shopping spot, attracting $3.3
billion from Japan, the study found. California was second, with
$2.98 billion, and New York was third, with $2.34 billion.
   Far behind, in order, were Arizona, Illinois, Texas, Washington
state, Florida, Washington, D.C., and Massachusetts.
   Office buildings commanded the most dollars from Japan _ $5.19
billion in 1987. Investment in hotel and resort properties soared
160 percent in 1987, to $4.57 billion, partly because of several
big purchases in Hawaii. Investment in residential property was
$1.3 billion.
   The study found increasing Japanese interest in so-called
secondary real estate markets, including Phoenix, Orange County,
Calif., Chicago, Miami and Seattle. For the first time in the three
years of the study, 56 percent of the purchases were in secondary
markets.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said Wednesday it had
agreed on a $30 million settlement of old alleged price-control
violations with Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla.
   The department had accused the company of selling
price-controlled oil to two buyers in exchange for discounts on
simultaneous purchase from them of oil that was not subjected to
controls, enabling Phillips to gain $51 million more on the sales
in 1979-1981 than it should have. Most crude oil was subject to
price controls at the time.
   In agreeing to the settlement, Phillips did not admit to any
violation of or failure to comply with the price-control
regulations.

   The stock market rolled up one of its biggest
gains of the year today, taking its cue from a stronger dollar and
a decline in interest rates.
   The market took off in the early afternoon after trading in a
narrow range earlier in the day.
   Analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar
in foreign exchange trading, which in turn prompted a decline in
interest rates.
   The dollar moved higher, they said, on speculation that the
major industrial nations may be moving toward a reaffirmation of
support for the currency against the Japanese yen. A meeting is
planned for next week.
   Such an agreement could mean that the Federal Reserve would no
longer feel it necessary to tighten its credit policy and push
interest rates higher in a bid to head off inflation.
   The advance in the Dow Jones industrial average of 30
industrials was so strong that it triggered for the first time a
voluntary plan under which the New York Stock Exchange hopes to
curb price volatility.

   The stock market surged Wednesday, putting in
its second-best performance so far this year after taking a cue
from a stronger dollar and lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 16.91 on
Tuesday, jumped another 64.16 points to close at 2,061.67.
   It was the biggest rise in the key blue-chip indicator since it
climbed 76.42 points on Jan. 4, the first trading day of the year.
   Gainers outpaced losers by nearly 3 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 189.76 million shares, compared
with 135.29 million on Tuesday.
   The Dow's advance was so strong it triggered a 50-point
voluntary restriction on computerized program trading on the New
York Stock Exchange for the first time since the limit was
announced Feb. 4.
   Program trading, a technique used by brokerages to profit on
price differences between stocks and the corresponding stock-index
futures, has been blamed for injecting volatility into the market
and frightening investors.
   The market climbed steadily throughout the afternoon after
trading in a narrow range earlier in the day.
   Analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar
in foreign exchange trading, which in turn prompted a decline in
interest rates in the credit markets.
   The dollar moved higher, they said, on speculation that the
major industrial nations may be moving toward a fresh agreement to
support the U.S. currency. A meeting of the industrial powers is
planned for next week.
   Such an agreement could mean that the Federal Reserve would no
longer feel it necessary to tighten its credit policy and push
interest rates higher in a bid to head off inflation.

   The dollar continued its ascent against most
major currencies Wednesday on rumors of more dollar-buying by the
Bank of Japan and a possible multinational accord to support the
U.S. currency.
   Gold and silver prices fell in reaction to the dollar's
strength. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$448.25 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $452.65 late Tuesday.
   A news report out of Japan, quoting anonymous sources, said
finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven
countries are likely to agree that the dollar should be held above
125 yen.
   Traders gave credence to the rumor of the dollar-yen target when
they saw evidence that the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury
securities for a customer, which they guessed might be the Bank of
Japan, said Arthur Liming, an analyst at LNS Financial Group in
Chicago.
   The dollar has also been helped somewhat by a high federal funds
rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. The
higher rate makes dollar-denominated securities more attractive.
   Liming said the dollar eased off from its highs of the day when
traders observed that the Federal Reserve was injecting reserves
into the financial system, something that would tend to restrain
interest rates.
   Dealers said the dollar was also boosted when a feared Japanese
selloff of dollars at the beginning of the new quarter failed to
materialize.
   But they said trading was likely to remain limited before next
week's meeting in Washington of officials of the Group of Seven _
the United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Canada and
Italy _ and the April 14 release of U.S. trade figures for February.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. The pound
fell to $1.8790 from $1.8800 late Tuesday. Later in New York, the
pound fell to $1.8716 from $1.8790 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 125.03 Japanese yen from
124.43 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it edged back to
124.98 yen. At the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar
rose to 126.03 yen from 125.28 yen late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6790 West German marks, up from
1.6706; 1.3893 Swiss francs, up from 1.3769; 1.2416 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2418; 5.6925 French francs, up from 5.6645;
and 1,243.12 Italian lire, up from 1,237.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.6700 West German marks, up from 1.6690; 1.3775
Swiss francs, up from 1.3765; 5.6570 French francs, down from
5.6605; 1.8720 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8700; 1,236.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,234.50; and 1.2401 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2395.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion fell to
$449.00 a troy ounce from $453.40 late Tuesday.
   In London, gold dropped to a late bid price of $449.50 a troy
ounce from $451.50 late Tuesday. In Zurich, it also fell to a late
bid of $449.50 an ounce, down from $453.50 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped $5.60 an ounce to close at a
bid $453.21 an ounce, down from $458.81 an ounce bid at Tuesday's
close.
   Silver bullion fell to a late bid of $6.57 a troy ounce from
$6.65 an ounce bid late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $6.434 a troy ounce from $6.65
late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Moore McCormack Resources Inc. said Wednesday it
has agreed to be acquired by Southdown Inc. for $512 million in
cash after resisting repeated overtures from the Houston-based
cement company.
   Moore McCormack's board recommended shareholders relinquish
their shares to Southdown's existing $40-a-share tender offer. The
offer expires at midnight EDT Wednesday, but Southdown said it
would accept Moore McCormack shares for payment following the
expiration of that deadline.
   Under terms of a definitive merger agreement, Southdown also
will acquire Moore McCormack's convertible issues and debt. The
companies have agreed to dismiss all pending litigation between
them.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Moore McCormack fell 75
cents to close at $39.75 a share; Southdown rose 50 cents to $40.75
a share.
   Southdown also said it would terminate a previous agreement to
sell Moore McCormack's oil and gas subsidiary, called Moore
McCormack Engery, to Castex International Corp. for $125 million in
cash.
   A Southdown spokeswoman had no comment on whether Moore
McCormack management would be asked to stay on board.
   Moore McCormack, a Stamford, Conn.-based cement and energy
concern, had said it was negotiating with other unidentified
parties about the acquisition of the entire company. The Moore
McCormack board met Tuesday to weigh bids for the company _
including Southdown's _ as well as a recapitalization plan the
board had engineered as a defensive measure.
   Southdown's latest offer for Moore McCormack's 12.8 million
outstanding shares represents the fourth time the company has
sweetened its bid.
   Southdown approached Moore McCormack on Feb. 23 with an initial
$31-a-share tender offer, which valued the company at $391 million.
That bid, as well as a sweetened $35-a-share offer that followed,
were rejected as inadequate.
   ``The board of directors of Moore McCormack continues to believe
that remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the
long-range term,'' the company had said in a statement following
the two offers.
   Moore McCormack responded to the two bids by unveiling a $400
million recapitalization plan that would have paid shareholders a
hefty dividend and authorized the sale of certain assets. The
company had even lined up loans to finance the payout and related
costs.
   A day after the recapitalization plan was unveiled, Southdown
responded with an offer that would have paid shareholders $35 in
cash plus debt securities valued at $5 for each share they held.
The bid was amended to a straight $40-a-share in cash last week.
   Moore McCormack posted a profit of $21.6 million on revenue of
$357.8 million in 1987. The company makes cement, concrete products
and aggregates, primarily in the southeastern United States, and is
engaged in oil and gas exploration and production mainly in Texas
and Louisiana.
   Southdown produces and sells cement and ready-mixed concrete and
is active in oil and gas production.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Plunge on Dollar's Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures retreated sharply Wednesday, triggered
by the surging value of the dollar.
   On other markets, wheat and cattle futures moved higher; other
grains and beans were mostly a little weaker; and stock index
futures posted substantial gains, following a rally on the stock
market.
   There were strong movements on most of the financial markets.
   ``The story that seemed to light the fire under all these
markets was a Japanese news account that (major financial
ministers) would reaffirm the lower the lower limit of the dollar
at about 125 yen,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   There have been unconfirmed reports that the finance ministers
from the five major industrial nations will meet next week in
Washington. This supposedly would be in conjunction with scheduled
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   The Japanese wire service, Nikkei, reported Wednesday that the
Group of 5 nations will affirm the dollar-yen rate.
   ``This was just a report,'' said Sloane, `` and we don't have
any idea if there's any truth to it. But with the yen at 125 this
morning ... the dollar went higher,'' he said.
   ``This pushed the precious metals to the brink,'' he said,
``with silver especially putting in a very poor performance.''
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $4.40 to
$5.70 lower with June at $451.30 a troy ounce; and silver was 22
cents to 22.5 cents lower with May at $6.465 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange recorded
one of the busiest days since the October stock crash. Estimated
volume of the Standard & Poor's 500 index was an estimated 62,286,
compared with a monthly average in March of about 48,000.
   A surge in the Dow Jones Industrial average triggered a curb at
the New York Stock Exchange on program trading, under which traders
buy or sell stocks and take the opposite action in index futures.
This came late in the session, however, and apparently didn't have
a large impact on trading at the Merc.
   The June S&P 500 contract settled 7.90 points higher at 267.40.
The underlying index was up 6.98 points at 265.49.
   Cattle futures advanced on follow-through buying from Tuesday's
late recovery at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but the
underlying factors don't look good, said Charlie Richardson, an
analyst with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   ``Feedlots are selling a little cheaper for the first time in
two or three weeks,'' he said, adding that the boxed beef trade is
declining.
   ``Salesmen are saying they're having trouble moving beef at the
retail counter and they're disappointed with the performance at
Easter,'' said Richardson.
   Live cattle futures settled .12 cent to .48 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in April at 74.02 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .02 cent to .40 cent higher with April at 79.57 cents a
pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .28 cent higher with April
at 45.70 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower
to .02 cent higher with May at 53.22 cents a pound.
   Wheat futures advanced while the other grains and soybeans were
mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat continued the gains posted during a sharp runup on
Tuesday, and overnight news gave the market fresh incentive.
   The Agriculture Department announced after the close of trading
on Tuesday that it is offering China 2 million tons of subsidized
wheat.
   This along with expectations that the Soviet Union will bid on a
half million tons of wheat this week combined to create a sense of
optimism in the wheat pit, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat settled 1} cents to 3} cents higher with the May contract
at $3.09\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with
May at $2.07{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to \ cent higher
with May at $1.65 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents to 4{ cents
lower with May at $6.67\ a bushel.
   Energy futures were little changed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 3 cents
higher with the April contract at $16.30 a barrel; heating oil was
.02 cent lower to .18 cent higher with May at 45.34 cents a gallon;
and unleaded gasoline was .07 cent lower to .22 cent lower with May
at 48.42 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Chrysler UAW Council Agreeing to Fall Into Pattern with GM, Ford</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of Chrysler Corp.
workers voted Wednesday to seek the job protections and economic
benefits won by the United Auto Workers union in contracts signed
last fall with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   ``We've had a pattern settlement before us now for almost a
year. ... It should not take a long time for us to put this
together,'' UAW President Owen Bieber told reporters after
addressing the 140-member UAW national Chrysler Council.
   Chrysler and the UAW agreed to open talks early _ April 18
instead of mid-July _ after Chrysler's attempt to sell its
28,000-worker Acustar Inc. subsidiary sparked bitter worker
opposition.
   Chrysler backed down from the sale in early March, shortly after
the issue erupted, but decided the damage left in its wake would
intensify if the two sides waited until July to meet at the
bargaining table.
   Bieber said he didn't believe the rift would hurt the chance of
an early settlement mirroring the industry-pattern GM and Ford
contracts.
   ``I don't plan on sitting in early negotiations with Chrysler
from the time we open here in April until Sept. 14,'' when
Chrysler's contract expires, Bieber said, adding that bargainers
will set a target settlement deadline after talks begin.
   Bieber also said negotiators would try to save four Acustar
plants that Chrysler said it will close or sell.
   The Chrysler contract covers 59,000 active and 8,000 laid-off
workers at 49 local unions. The UAW wants a two-year contract with
Chrysler instead of the usual three-year pact so that its contracts
with all Big Three automakers will expire together in 1990.
   UAW Vice President Marc Stepp said the council will vote
Thursday on other demands and on a potentially divisive issue _
whether nearly 1,000 former American Motors Corp. workers at an
engine and stamping plant in Kenosha, Wis., should be included
under the Chrysler contract.
   Some local union leaders said they oppose the idea because if
the Kenosha engine plant closes, those workers would have the right
to take jobs that otherwise could go to laid-off Chrysler workers.
   Chrysler already has said it will close a 5,500-worker assembly
plant in Kenosha by year's end, and those workers will be covered
under a separate closing agreement. All the Kenosha workers belong
to the UAW but currently work under contracts negotiated with AMC,
not Chrysler.
   Stepp said the union traditionally has included operations
purchased by an automaker under that company's national contract.
   Other union officials, who asked not to be identified, called
the opposition selfish and argued that the Kenosha workers already
are part of Chrysler, which bought AMC last year.
   Proposals approved Wednesday would, like the pattern GM and Ford
contracts, forbid plant closings not announced before the start of
negotiations. The union's proposals for Chrysler also would ban
sale of plants or other operations, according to the printed
resolutions approved by the council.
   The Ford and GM agreements also forbid layoffs for any reason
except slow sales of a product. The exception, seen as a loophole
by many workers, has allowed GM to indefinitely close plants that
make products whose sales were lagging.
   But Bieber said any loophole would most likely be addressed in
1990 talks rather than at the Chrysler table this year.
   Under the pattern, workers also will receive bonuses equal to 3
percent of their 1988 and 1989 earnings and a share of
sales-generated profits if their companies' earn above a set amount.
   The UAW also wants to increase its representation on Chrysler's
board of directors _ already unique in the auto industry _ from one
seat to four. The current seat belongs to the UAW president, and
Bieber said it gives him an extra chance to try influencing some
corporate decisions that affect his members.
   With three other UAW members on the board, Bieber joked, ``It
wouldn't be a 19-1 vote anymore. I'm convinced I could convince my
(UAW) colleagues to vote with me.''

<HEAD>Lottery Keeps Computer Vendor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania Lottery said Wednesday
it has decided to stick with its computer vendor, Control Data
Corp. of Minneapolis, in a new five-year, $143 million contract.
   Companies from Rhode Island, Maryland and Georgia were
unsuccessful in their bid for the contract with the lottery, the
nation's third largest. The Pennsylvania Lottery had gross revenue
of of $1.3 billion in 1986-87 and profits of $570 million.
   Control Data's Automated Wagering Division, based in New York
City, will supply a minimum of 3,200 new sales terminals and a
primary and backup computer with new telecommunications features,
said Revenue Secretary Barton Fields. The new equipment is to be
installed by next January.
   After a three-month review, lottery officials decided Control
Data's 11 years' experience as the lottery's computer supplier and
its proposed system were among the reasons to keep the company,
Fields said.
   ``CDC, by virtue of its state-of-the-art technology and
expertise, is the supplier best suited to serve the lottery into
the 1990s,'' Fields said in a statement.
   Other vendors who had submitted proposals were G-Tech Corp. of
Warwick, R.I., General Instruments Corp. of Hunt Valley, Md. and
Scientific Games of Atlanta.
   The new contract will take effect Jan. 1, 1989, and the $143
million is the estimated worth over five years.
   ``The Pennsylvania Lottery system will be the newest and most
powerful lottery system available to the lottery industry today,''
said James Chidester, vice president of wagering services for the
Automated Wagering Division.
   Control Data, with over 50 percent of the market for on-line
lottery equipment, supplies lotteries in five states besides
Pennsylvania and recently was awarded the contract for Florida's
new lottery, the company said. The other states with Control Data
equipment are Maryland, Delaware, New York, Illinois and Washington.

   G.D. Searle & Co. said Wednesday it will expand a
program of giving heart disease drugs to the poor, a move observers
say puts the company at the helm of the pharmaceutical industry's
efforts to help the indigent.
   Under a year-old pilot program, Skokie-based Searle gave $9
million worth of high blood pressure medicine to 20,000 patients.
The company said it would expand its ``Patient In Need'' program by
making all seven of its heart medicines available.
   The plan will roughly double the cost and the number of patients
involved, company officials said.
   To kick off its expanded program, Searle planned on Wednesday to
deliver $1 million worth of certificates for drugs to clinics and
hospitals in 10 major cities.
   ``I personally believe that all drugs that treat
life-threatening diseases should be involved,'' said Dr. Sheldon G.
Gilgore, Searle's chairman and chief executive officer. He noted
that congressional sources put the number of Americans without any
health insurance at 37 million.
   Judee Shuler, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, said all drug manufacturers do something to help poor
patients, ``but Searle is more extensive.''
   Most of Searle's drugs are cardiovascular medications, and
Gilgore called on other pharmaceutical houses to follow suit with
their drugs.
   ``This area is extremely tricky,'' said Thomas Nefi, a spokesman
for E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. of Princeton, N.J. ``Drugs are a
commodity rigorously controled by the federal government. It's not
like making shoes and giving them to the poor.''
   Nefi said he was not familiar with the details of Searle's
program, but he noted that ``the distribution mechanism is going to
be difficult, and I would like to see how they're going to do it.''
   Searle's expanded effort will distribute the drugs in the same
manner as the pilot program, said spokesman William I. Greener.
   Participating doctors are issued certificates from Searle.
Patients receive both a prescription and a certificate, both of
which must be presented to a pharmacist.
   Patients get the drugs for free, while pharmacists mail the
certificates to Searle for reimbursement.
   The company classifies poor people as those with annual
household incomes of $8,000 for one or two people, or $11,000 for
three or more family members. To qualify, patients must not have
insurance or other assistance that would pay for the drug.
   Several other drug makers have some form of indigent care
program.
   Merck Sharp & Dohme, a division of Merck & Co., donates drugs to
various charitable groups, such as the Catholic Medical Mission
Board, which distributes them to physicians who pass them on to the
needy at home and abroad.
   Merck also will give free drugs to individual doctors who
request them for poor patients, said spkeswoman Nancy Gellert.
   ``We feel we give a pretty broadly based coverage,'' she said.
   Roxane Laboratories in Columbus, Ohio, gives a drug to poor
terminal cancer patients in severe pain, said company spokesman
Gerald C. Wojta. The company announced its plan several years ago.
   Wyeth Laboratories, a division of American Home Products Corp.,
has a ``compassionate program for the tryly needy through the
physician,'' said spokeswoman Audrey Ashby. ``It's judged on a
patient-by-patient basis.''
   Searle is a research-based company that develops, manufactures
and markets prescription pharmaceuticals worldwide. It is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Monsanto Co.

<HEAD>Greeting Card Company Reports Earnings Decline</HEAD>

   American Greetings, the nation's second largest
greeting card company, reported Wednesday that its earnings
declined by 95.1 percent in its fourth quarter, which included
Christmas sales.
   The quarter contributed to a 47.3 percent earnings decline in
American Greetings' fiscal 1988, completed Feb. 29.
   Morry Weiss, president and chief executive officer, said at a
news conference that stiff competition, combined with unexpected
returns of seasonal merchandise, contributed heavily to the
earnings drop.
   The company's AmToy subsidiary also had a disappointing quarter
and year, Weiss said.
   The company earned $748,000, or 2 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter, although revenue amounted to $314.5 million. In the final
quarter of 1987, American Greetings earned $15.3 million, or 48
cents a share, on revenue of $291.2 million.
   For the full fiscal year, American Greetings earned $33.4
million, or $1.04 a share, on revenue of nearly $1.2 billion. In
the prior year, earnings came to $63.6 million, or $1.97 a share,
on revenue exceeding $1.2 billion.
   Earnings dropped for a third consecutive year. The per-share
earnings of $1.04 was the lowest since fiscal 1981, when earnings
were 97 cents per share.
   ``While results for fiscal 1988 are a major disappointment, the
good news is that they reflect, in part, a number of corrective
measures taken which should be positive for our future prospects,''
Weiss said.
   He said the company has begun or is considering consolidation of
its manufacturing and distribution operations of the domestic
greeting card business, personnel reductions, revisions in seasonal
merchandise shipping and a scaling back of the toy business.
   He also said the company needs a spurt of creativity to increase
sales, adding that there has been good initial reaction to its new
Nosy Bears and Special Blessings products.
   The Cleveland-based company employs about 20,000. Some layoffs
occurred last year, although the company-wide figure has not been
made public, said John Hernandis, American Greetings spokesman.

<HEAD>Maryland Senate Approves Bills To Block Chesapeake Bay Drilling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by the increased interest shown by
petroleum companies in the Chesapeake Bay, the Senate approved a
measure Wednesday that would forbid drilling for oil and gas in the
bay and its tidal tributaries.
   The measure, drafted by a legislative workgroup, now goes to
Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who has endorsed the ban as a
necessary element in the multi-state effort to protect the bay's
environment.
   The upper house also approved two other bills that would give
the state a greater role in regulating oil and gas exploration and
production elsewhere in the state.
   While there is currently no drilling in the bay, the
environmental community became alarmed late last year by reports
that Texaco Inc. and Exxon Corp. would fund additional seismic
testing in the bay to locate possible oil or gas deposits.
   During an earlier hearing on the bill, Delegate Brian Frosh,
D-Montgomery, chief sponsor of all three bills, likened oil
drilling in the bay to ``playing Russian roulette.''
   `A single spill could set back all of our bay cleanup efforts
many years,'' insisted Frosh. ``The Chesapeake Bay is far too
important to our heritage and our future to put at risk in this
fashion.''
   At the same hearing, oil industry representatives said they have
a good environmental record in off-shore drilling and urged
lawmakers not to thwart the search for new petroleum sources.
   ``This country and this state cannot wait until the next
international oil crisis arises,'' argued Michael McDonald,
director of the Maryland Petroleum Council.
   The Schaefer administration also has given tentative backing to
the other two measures approved in the Senate Wednesday. Both bills
will be returned to the House for further consideration.
   Under HB296, the Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Commission would
be given the power to deny any application for drilling rights in
so-called critical areas surrounding the bay.
   HB296 would require the state Board of Public Works to adopt
regulations to govern oil drilling leases in Maryland. The bill
also would hold drilling companies liable for any environmental
damage caused by their activities.

   A federal judge said Wednesday that Britain's
Brian Beazer cannot proceed with his $1.7 billion hostile tender
offer for Koppers Co. until at least April 15.
   A U.S. District judge in Los Angeles on Monday suspended the
$60-a-share offer indefinitely on antitrust grounds. U.S. District
Judge Maurice Cohill in Pittsburgh said if Beazer succeeds in
overturning the California ruling, his order immediately blocks the
offer until he rules on Koppers' arguments that the unwanted
suitors violated securities law.
   Cohill said he will rule by April 15 on the Pittsburgh
construction materials and chemicals company's request for a
preliminary injunction.
   It was not immediately clear how this latest barrier would
affect the tender offer from BNS Inc., the takeover company formed
by Beazer and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Attorneys for the Beazer
interests said a delay could scuttle its tender offer.
   Meanwhile, Koppers Chairman Charles R. Pullin said Wednesday he
expects Beazer's tender offer will be declared inadequate by
Koppers board of directors.
   ``My judgment is that with more time we will find that (the bid)
is inadequate,'' Pullin testified in federal court, one day after
Koppers' board said it was reserving judgment on the offer.
   Under questioning by BNS attorney Edwin Mishkin, Pullin said he
also expected someone to beat the $60-a-share offer.
   ``I'm not sure I could hazard a guess as to when'' a better
offer might come, Pullin said.
   The chairman said he expected some stockholders would consider
$60 a share as an adequate offer. He said he also expected some
shareholders would want to accept the $60 a share. Arbitrageurs
likely would tender their stock as well, he said.
   The offer from Beazer, head of the construction and building
materials concern Beazer PLC, and Shearson Lehman Hutton was to
have expired at midnight Thursday. The two are partners in BNS
along with the National Westminster Bank PLC, which launched the
tender offer March 3.
   Pullin told Cohill on Wednesday that the board is considering
selling an interest in all or part of the company. Koppers prefers
to sell no more than 20 percent to 25 percent of its valued
construction materials and services group, he said.
   Koppers has said it also is considering a recapitalization plan
and, if necessary, the sale of the entire company as a defensive
measure. Charles Barber, a Koppers director, noted in testimony
Tuesday that a recapitalization plan is still in the formative
stages.
   A management-led buyout of Koppers' chemicals businesses also
has been considered an alternative to the BNS offer.
   ``Some management people have talked about a leveraged buyout,
which would keep (the company) here in Pittsburgh,'' Pullin
testified during a hearing to consider Koppers' request for an
injunction.
   So far, however, a leveraged buyout of the company's chemical
operations ``hasn't been actively pursued,'' partly because of the
costs involved, he added.
   Pullin said the Koppers board met Tuesday with its financial
advisers, who gave ambiguous opinions on Beazer's valuation of the
company.
   Dillon Read & Co., engaged to advise non-management directors,
was unable to say the $60-a-share offer was adequate, but First
Boston Corp., which is advising all the directors, was unable to
say the offer was inadequate, Pullin said.
   Koppers closed on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday at
$55.37{ a share, down 87{ cents.
   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday denied an
emergency motion to overturn the lower court. But the appeals court
will take the appeal during the coming week, Cohill said.

   Fortified by a stronger dollar, lower interest
rates and an afternoon of frenzied buying, the stock market soared
Wednesday as the Dow Jones industrial average posted its second
biggest gain of the year.
   But despite the strong gain, some analysts were skeptical about
how long it could last.
   ``It was a very impressive rally, but it's still a manic
depressive market, so I'm not trusting it yet for any sustained
move,'' said Thomas Czech, head of the investment policy group at
the brokerage Blunt Ellis & Loewi in Milwaukee.
   The Dow Jones industrials, the market's best-known indicator,
advanced 64.16 points to close at 2,061.67. It was the ninth
biggest gain ever in the Dow Jones industrials and the largest gain
since it climbed 76.42 on Jan. 4.
   The Dow's gain was so powerful that it triggered a 50-point
voluntary restriction on computerized program trading on the New
York Stock Exchange for the first time since the limit was
announced Feb. 4.
   But even after the restriction was triggered, stock prices
continued to rise until the market closed.
   Gainers swamped losers by a margin of nearly 3 to 1 in the
overall tally of NYSE-listed issues, with 1,187 up, 414 down and
384 unchanged. The NYSE index rose 3.47 to 149.76.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 189.76 million shares, up from
135.29 million shares on Tuesday.
   The stock market opened with some modest gains but gave most of
them back by noontime before sweeping broadly ahead in the early
afternoon.
   Analysts said the trigger for the market's rise was a news
report from Japan that said officials of the seven major industrial
countries are likely to agree on a plan of support for the dollar.
   A strong dollar would diminish inflationary pressure, and
perhaps ease the pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten its
credit policy, said Newton D. Zinder, who follows stocks for the
investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   Expectations that the Fed would tighten its policy and raise
interest rates had been depressing stock market psychology, he said.
   Larry Wachtel, a market watcher for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the dollar's strength soon rippled through the bond
market, sending long-term rates lower. That in turn made yields on
stocks look more attractive, he said.
   In each of the markets, he said traders who had sold borrowed
contracts in expectations that the dollar, bonds and stocks would
fall suddenly saw prices rising and felt compelled to buy in an
effort to cut their potential losses.
   ``Too many people were selling the market short,'' he said.
   The voluntary restrictions on program trading were called into
play after the Dow Jones average passed the 50-point gain mark at
about 3:19 p.m. EDT, a spokeswoman for the exchange said.
   Program trading, a technique used by brokerages to profit on
price differences between stocks and the corresponding stock-index
futures, has been blamed for injecting volatility into the market
and frightening investors.
   Among actively-traded issues on the NYSE, American Telephone &
Telegraph rose 1\ to 28[, Texaco rose 1\ to 49, Exxon climbed 2 to
44 and General Electric rose 1[ to 41}.
   F.W. Woolworth fell 1} to 54~. The stock shot up more than $11 a
share in the previous two sessions after a group led by Dart Group
Corp. Chairman Herbert Haft expressed interest in acquiring a stake
in the retailer.
   Elsewhere in the retail group, Sears rose 1\ to 37[, K mart
climbed 1[ to 35\ and J.C. Penney rose 1 to 48}.
   The automakers rolled up some impressive advances after
reporting strong late-March sales. General Motors rose 3] to 74,
Ford jumped 1~ to 46\ and Chrysler rose 1\ to 24{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $55.65 billion, or 2.16
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 225.98 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 8.54 to 308.71,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 6.98 to 265.49.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.51
to 297.58. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 377.74, up 4.33.

   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner said
Wednesday he does not want a judge to set aside his setence for tax
evasion that grants five years' probation on the condition he set
up a $3 million program for the homeless.
   Posner responded to a motion filed Monday by a federal
prosecutor challenging the legality of that sentence. U.S. Attorney
Leon Kellner said the court could not force a defendant to make a
contribution to ``a non-aggrieved person.''
   At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman
required the 69-year-old Posner to state under oath that he did not
wish the sentence set aside and that he was going ahead with the
plan ``freely and voluntarily.''
   Spellman said Posner's chief attorney, Edward Bennett Williams,
must formally reply to Kellner's motion within 30 days.
   Meanwhile, Spellman heard Posner and a 10-member blue-ribbon
committee discuss the program's first stage, a study of
homelessness in three southern Florida counties.
   ``Since February, I have been studying and learning about the
problems of the homeless both nationally and in Florida,'' Posner
said in a brief statement. Part of his sentence has included work
at Camillus House, a refuge for the homeless in Miami where Posner
served food, attended substance abuse meetings and gave out
clothing.
   Posner said the study, which is being administered by Barry
University, will examine groups such as alcoholics, the mentally
ill and families with children and will review how government
policies affect homelessness. Findings of the study are scheduled
to be available by mid-May.
   But he stressed that the study is not the most important element
of the program.
   ``All the studies in the world will not help one homeless
person,'' Posner added. ``I will come to you with what will solve
the problem.''
   Spellman said he didn't plan to take an active role in the
committee's work, but he suggested the initial study not use more
than $250,000 to $500,000 of Posner's donation.
   Posner said he was ready to deposit the necessary money in any
institution directed by the court.
   The sentence also ordered Posner to pay about $4 million in back
taxes, penalties, interest and fines for pleading no-contest to 10
counts of tax fraud for inflating the value of land donated to
Miami Christian College.
   Spellman acknowledged when he imposed the sentence that its
legality might be questioned.
   ``If for some reason (the sentence) is ever challenged, this
court will, in fact, incarcerate Victor Posner,'' he said in
February. Posner could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison for
the offenses.

   MGM-UA Communications Inc. said Wednesday
that more suitors have come forward since the filmmaking company
announced Monday it was considering several unsolicited takeover
bids.
   Separately, the company reported it had reduced its losses by 73
percent for the second quarter and 84 percent for the half, partly
because of its successful film ``Moonstruck.''
   Disclosure of the new bids came as the company announced a
special committee of its board has been formed to weigh the offers.
The committee does not include financier Kirk Kerkorian, who owns
79 percent of the company's 50.1 million shares.
   ``The committee will promptly consider the inquiries received
before Monday's announcement, as well as additional inquiries
received in the last two days,'' said MGM-UA's chairman and chief
executive, Lee Rich.
   The company again declined to identify the suitors or to
indicate whether it would be amenable to a takeover, saying only,
``We have a duty to our shareholders to explore these matters.''
   Analysts have suggested Kerkorian may be offering to buy the
rest of the stock and take the company private. Other likely
investors listed by analysts were investors Marvin Davis and Burt
Sugarman, whose separate bids for other companies are stalled and
considered unlikely to succeed.
   Kerkorian had been majority owner of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
and United Artists studios, then sold them in 1986 to media
entrepreneur Ted Turner for $1.5 billion plus assumption of some
debt. As part of that deal, Kerkorian immediately repurchased the
UA segment.
   Later, Turner sold off all of the MGM unit except for its film
library that he is using on his Atlanta-based superstation WTBS.
Kerkorkian purchased the studio and Lorimar-Telepictures Corp.
bought some other assets.
   Kerkorian paid a total of $730 million to buy back the two
segments and has had spotty success in his attempts to rebuild the
companies.
   For its second quarter ended Feb. 29, the comapny posted a net
loss of $4.6 million, compared with a deficit of $17.1 million a
year earlier. Revenue for the period rose 48 percent to $157.9
million from $106.2 million.
   For the half, the company trimmed its losses to $2.6 million
from $14.4 million, as revenue rose 43 percent to $339.9 million
from $237.2 million.

   Buyer incentives and economic confidence boosted
late-March and first-quarter sales reported Wednesday by the Big
Three automakers.
   Some import carmakers also reported increases although many
posted declines for the March 21-31 sales period and for the
quarter, blaming the weaker dollar that effectively raised their
prices for American buyers.
   Domestic car sales totaled 332,721 for the 10 days, up from
282,358 for the nine-day sales period of late March 1987. Domestic
sales for the first quarter totaled 1,914,022, up from 1,666,748 a
year earlier.
   Import car sales, reported monthly, totaled 255,867 for March,
up from 237,677 in March 1987, and totaled 700,572 for the quarter,
up from 639,403 in the 1987 first quarter.
   First-quarter sales of imported light trucks slid to 168,908
from 204,424 in the 1987 first quarter. Domestic light truck sales
jumped to 1,044,984 for the quarter from 840,073 a year earlier.
   Sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.4 million
for the late March period, up from a strong 8.1 million rate for
the period last year, and were 7.5 million for the month, up from
7.3 million for March 1987.
   ``Sales are robust for the month, continuing what was going on
in January and February,'' said Cynthia Certo, analyst at
Integrated Automotive Resources Inc. in Wayne, Pa.
   She added buyers appeared confident in a strong election-year
economy and unworried about last October's stock slump.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. each reported more than 18
percent jumps in daily sales rates for the quarter while General
Motors Corp., the top seller, reported a 9.5 percent rise.
   Dealers incentives helped, said Robert L. Rewey, a Ford vice
president.
   ``Cash-allowance buyer incentive programs are in effect a
temporary price cut and the buyers are reacting to the bargain
prices,'' Rewey said.
   GM sold 159,728 domestically produced autos for the 10 days, up
from 136,082 in the nine-day late-March period last year, and
942,830 for the quarter, up from 849,470 in the 1987 first quarter.
GM's daily sales rate was up 9.5 percent.
   Ford domestic auto sales totaled 93,590 for the 10 days, up from
79,249 a year earlier, and 553,545 for the three months, up from
462,629 for the 1987 first quarter.
   Ford set a record with sales of 150,522 domestically made light
trucks for the month of March, up from 132,126 in March 1987 and
the most for any March for Ford.
   Chrysler sold 48,125 domestic cars for the 10 days, up from
41,652 in the year-ago period, and 283,491 for the quarter, up from
236,280 in the first quarter of 1987.
   Some import carmakers also reported increases. For example,
Toyota sales rose to 42,734 for March from 37,099 in March 1987,
and 127,050 for the quarter, up from 101,117 in the first quarter
of 1987.
   But Nissan sales slid to 39,536 for the month from 41,824 in
March 1987, and to 92,163 for the quarter, down from 119,452 a year
ago.

   The advertising agency Lord Geller Federico
Einstein Inc., in turmoil since a number of top-level executives
quit to form their own agency in mid-March, said Wednesday it has
added two senior executives from other advertising agencies to its
management team.
   The agency, a unit of WPP Group PLC, named Agi Clark, a 19-year
veteran of the agency N.W. Ayer, and Tim Elliott, formerly of
Ogilvy & Mather, to senior management.
   Clark was named executive vice president and managing director
for creative services at Lord Geller. She had been with Ayer for 19
years, most recently overseeing creative work on the AT&T
Communications, Gillette and J.C. Penney accounts, Lord Geller
announced.
   Elliott was named Lord Geller's chief operating officer. At
Ogilvy & Mather, he had worked on the American Express Co. account.
   They join the current management group which includes Norman
Geller as chairman, Gene Federico as vice chairman and J. William
Wardell as president.
   The agency has been in tumult since March 18 when six top
executives, including Lord Geller founders Richard Lord and Arthur
Einstein Jr., walked off the job. The executives said they felt
unduly constrained by the management of WPP Group, the British
marketing concern that acquired the agency as part of its purchase
last summer of the JWT Group Inc.
   They have formed their own agency, Lord, Einstein, O'Neill &
Partners.
   WPP Group has sued departing executives, accusing them of
breaching their fiduciary duties in leaving the firm and conspiring
to take away Lord Geller's business.
   The suit is pending in New York state court.
